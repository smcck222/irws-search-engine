FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Quaker Oats selling Sutherlands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quaker Oats Company is to sell the Sutherlands Foods division to C Shippam
of Chichester, a subsidiary of Pet Incorporated.
Sutherland produces savoury spreads and pastes, but Quaker said those had
little strategic fit within the core businesses. Its net assets at June 30
were Pounds 3.1m.
Shippam said it will capitalise on the expertise of both businesses to offer
a comprehensive range of savoury sandwich filling products with a wider
distribution base.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Colorvision back to profit at Pounds
153,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COLORVISION, the Liverpool-based retailer of television and satellite
systems, returned to the black with profits of Pounds 153,000 before tax in
the six months to September 30.
However, last time's losses of Pounds 545,000 were caused by an exceptional
debit of Pounds 808,000 - an adjustment from an understatement of creditors
and provisions in prior years.
Turnover grew to Pounds 26.75m (Pounds 24.1m) and operating losses were
halved to Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 144,000) in what is the company's quieter
trading period.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that the company had again increased
market share, though more slowly than in the previous 12 months. He added
that profitability had been adversely affected by shortages in the supply of
satellites in the second half of the period.
However, he said that the conditions for economic recovery were now more
favourable than for several years.
To reflect the seasonality of the company's trading, the interim dividend is
reduced to 2.5p (3.1p), but the total is expected to be maintained at 5.6p.
Earnings worked through at 0.5p (losses 1.7p) per share.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ICI insurance arm in marine deal at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' insurance subsidiary, IC Insurance, is to
reinsure more than Pounds 1m worth of business underwritten by a marine
syndicate at the Lloyd's insurance market.
IC Insurance, which was formed in the 1920s to underwrite ICI's own risks,
already sells insurance to other companies, but this will be the first time
that it has had any dealings with Lloyd's, where insurance rates are rising
strongly after three years of heavy trading losses.
IC Insurance will underwrite 5 per cent of a whole account 'quota share'
reinsurance policy for syndicate 741, which is managed by AJ Archer
Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency.
The syndicate specialises in marine risks such as ship hulls and oil rigs
and expects to underwrite under Pounds 40m in premium income in 1993.
Quota share involves reinsurers assuming a set percentage of risk in return
for the same portion of the original premium, less a commission.
However, new Lloyd's rules approved last summer, have increased syndicates'
ability to make use of these arrangements in order to boost their capacity
to accept premiums.
Under Lloyd's solvency rules the syndicates can only accept premiums equal
to their capacity, which directly reflects the capital traded by the Names
who back them.
Following the rule change syndicates are allowed to underwrite an extra 25
per cent of premiums if all of this amount is reinsured by quota share with
a company outside the market.
This year a number of syndicates have agreed such deals. Mr Robert Godden,
IC Insurance marine manager, said: 'It is a good opportunity. It didn't
stretch our resources and there is no clash with the rest of our business.'
IC Insurance had examined reinsurance deals with six Lloyd's syndicates.
Mr Godden stressed that IC Insurance also did deals with insurers outside
Lloyd's.
'There is nothing new in it as far as we are concerned.'
The deal has attracted interest because Lloyd's is currently examining ways
in which it can attract institutional investors and insurance companies to
participate directly in syndicates, in order to boost the market's shrinking
capital base.
IC Insurance underwrites all classes of insurance. Its annual gross premium
income amounted to about Pounds 110m in 1990.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hunter Saphir suspended on bid talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce and herbs and spices company,
were suspended yesterday as the company announced it was in 'advanced
discussions' with a possible bidder.
Berisford International, the commodities and property group, has a 19.8 per
cent stake in Hunter Saphir's ordinary shares, as well as some preference
shares, following a 1986 asset swap.
However, it is understood Berisford is a willing seller of its stake to a
third party and has been involved in the discussions. The Saphir family is
the other main shareholder and owns more than 20 per cent of the company.
A number of possible suitors were rumoured to be behind the talks. These
include food and agribusiness group Dalgety and Albert Fisher, the food
processing and distribution concern.
Dalgety was thought to have previously approached Hunter Saphir, in early
1991, but the companies could not agree on price.
According to analysts, the recent fall in Hunter Saphir's share price made
it vulnerable to predators. The company has been hit by low volumes at its
new British Pepper and Spice factory in Northampton. That, and unsuccessful
forays into areas like popcorn, have overshadowed the shares which have been
falling since 1989 and touched 27p last October. They were suspended at 36p.
Hunter Saphir said a further announcement would be made today.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tour chiefs embroiled in battle of brands -
Airtours' plans for a sharper profile for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Crossland, chairman of Airtours, says he is not enjoying the
acrimonious exchanges in the wake of the company's hostile Pounds 217m bid
for fellow tour operator Owners Abroad.
'Sometimes it feels quite hurtful. I read about myself in the newspapers and
I think: 'I must be a really bad person. I must be the sort of person who
goes home and kicks the wife and the cat',' he says.
He concedes that he should perhaps have considered his personal sensitivity
before launching the bid earlier this month.
He does not, however, appear squeamish about attacking Owners Abroad's
performance, beginning with what he calls its 'misguided policy of brand
proliferation.'
The question of what brand names to give the holidays they sell is one of
the most striking differences between the two companies. Mr Crossland says
that if the bid succeeds he will reduce sharply Owners Abroad's brands,
raising the question of how successful he will be in keeping its customers.
Virtually everything Airtours sells carries the company's name.
It does sell self-drive camping and mobile home holidays under the name
EuroSites. It also last year acquired the Pickfords chain of travel
agencies, which continues to trade under its original name.
Otherwise, travellers buy Airtours holidays, whether they are going to the
Mediterranean or Florida. Most fly Airtours International, the
eight-aircraft charter carrier.
Most Owners Abroad customers probably have no idea which company sold them
their holiday. Its package tourists travel under a bewildering range of
brand names.
The company was created to sell airline seats to people with holiday homes
abroad. It still operates a small business selling seats under the Owners
Abroad name.
The 1990 purchase of Redwing, which was 50 per cent owned by British
Airways, brought in names such as Sovereign, Enterprise, Martin Rooks and
Sunmed. There have been several other acquisitions, adding names like
Tjaereborg, which sells direct to the public rather than through travel
agents. Owners Abroad's airline is called Air 2000.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, says the company has reduced the
number of its brands from 13 to nine. Several of the nine do, however, have
sub-brands.
Mr Klein argues that the advantage of multi-branding is that different
holidays can be sold to different markets.
Sovereign offers up-market packages, Martyn Holidays sells trips to Portugal
for older families, Twentys appeals to the youth market, Sunmed offers cheap
holidays to Greece and Turkey, Olympic sells more expensive holidays to
Greece.
Specialised brands appeal to people who do not like to see themselves as
part of the mass tourist market, Mr Klein argues.
Having several different names means Owners Abroad occupies more space on
travel agents' racks. It also means that if one brand suffers from bad
publicity it does not affect the rest of the company, he says.
Mr Crossland counters that the proliferation of brands is confusing; all
package tourists want is value for money. He refuses to specify what he will
do with Owners Abroad's brands, but he makes it clear that there will be far
fewer of them.
Many in the travel industry believe brands have limited effect. Most
holidaymakers have little loyalty to a particular name or company.
Mr Lester Porter, group commercial director of Thomas Cook, the travel
agents' chain, says his company has increased sales on some holidays by 30
per cent by putting its own name on them.
But then Thomas Cook, with which Owners Abroad intends to establish links if
the Airtours bid fails, is one of the best-known travel brands in the world.
Others make less impact.
Mr Porter says: 'Some customers will come in and ask us for a particular
tour brand. But probably the majority come in and say, 'I'd really like to
go to Spain next year and I'd like something on the beach. What do you
recommend?' They're looking for the right holiday rather than a particular
brand.'
Mr Crossland believes Airtours can hold on to most of Owners Abroad's
holidaymakers, even if it does get rid of most of its brands, although he
concedes that some customers will be lost.
The precedents, however, are not encouraging. When Thomson, the largest tour
operator, acquired Horizon in 1989, the enlarged group had nearly 40 per
cent of the package tour market. Last year, Thomson's share was about 30 per
cent.
Mr Crossland says that what Airtours will be buying, if the bid succeeds, is
Owners Abroad's destinations rather than its customers.
It will take over Owners Abroad's hotel beds, even if it sell them under
different brands. Mr Crossland argues that customers do remain loyal to
certain resorts and hotels.
But what of the hotel owners? When International Leisure Group, then the
second biggest operator, collapsed in 1991, many of its senior executives
were soon back in business, heading new companies. Owners Abroad executives
displaced by a takeover would almost certainly do the same. Won't hoteliers
prefer to sell their beds to the Owners Abroad contacts they have come to
know?
Mr Crossland says the hoteliers will switch to Airtours, recognising that it
had become a larger and stronger company. 'They are very sophisticated
individuals. They know exactly what's going on. You do them an injustice,'
Mr Crossland says.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Spanish banking group in Pta150bn partial privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government plans to raise Pta150bn (Pounds 850m) through the
sale of 25 per cent of the capital in Argentaria, the wholly state-owned
banking group. This would be the biggest share placement ever by a Spanish
institution.
An Argentaria spokesman said yesterday that the government was expected to
approve the corporation's partial privatisation in a matter of days. 'The
decision is virtually imminent,' he said.
Argentaria was created in May 1991 when five government-controlled financial
institutions - including Banco Exterior, now Argentaria's flagship bank -
were grouped into a single banking corporation.
It reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pta50bn last year, a 64 per cent
increase on income earned from May to December 1991.
The issue is likely to be in several tranches, aimed at small domestic
investors and institutional investors in Spain and abroad.
The decision to float Argentaria partially is in line with the government's
strategy of reducing the public deficit through disposals of state
shareholdings. Repsol, the state energy group which raised Pta130bn in 1989,
said earlier this week that it aimed to raise a further Pta50bn in an
international share issue scheduled for the next two to three months.
Argentaria's consolidated book value on December 31, 1991, was Pta528bn.
Current market capitalisation is conservatively estimated at Pta600bn.
In an important preliminary step to the Argentaria placement, the economy
ministry has transferred a number of loans, credits and guarantees linked to
mostly loss-making public enterprises from Argentaria to the Instituto de
Credito Oficial the state financing agency.
These assets, which total Pta392bn and include equity in certain steel
companies, had belonged to the former Banco de Credito Industrial, which was
absorbed by Banco Exterior.
By putting all assets that could be subject to political decisions under the
wing of the ICO, the government has underlined its policy that Argentaria
should operate as a purely commercial institution responding solely to
market forces.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Lucas forms electronics unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the UK car and aerospace components group which has
recently been seen as a possible candidate for takeover, has integrated its
separate electronics activities into one business.
Lucas Electronics, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 100m, employs
1,900 people and has sites and resources in Europe, North America and Asia.
The new business is designed to benefit from Lucas's capital investment in
electronics and to exploit the increasing convergence in components used by
the group's aerospace and automotive markets.
The move is part of a three-year restructuring programme, announced in
October, which would shed 4,000 jobs, half of them in the UK, to bring the
workforce below 50,000.
Mr Paul Brown, managing director of Lucas Electronics, said the new business
would contribute to the group's cost-savings drive, but believed that growth
would protect the jobs of his 600 electronics, software and manufacturing
engineers.
Lucas Electronics sells 70 per cent of its products within the the group,
but aims to increase the proportion going outside to 50 per cent within 18
months. Mr Brown was confident that increasing applications for electronics
in safety and fuel control systems would ensure annual organic growth of
more than 20 per cent.
Lucas recently took a fuel control mechanism from a British motor car and
applied it to Rolls-Royce's Tay aero-engine, at about half the cost of
existing aerospace fuel management systems. A diesel fuel-injection system
for Volvo trucks has also been modified for use on locomotives made by
General Electric of the US.
Mr Brown said a priority would be to create a library of re-usable solutions
to recurring problems - such as noise, vibration and security. Preferred
components would also be identified, so the new business could benefit from
economies of scale in manufacturing and purchasing.
Lucas shares yesterday closed 1 1/2 p lower at 140 1/2 p, valuing the group
at Pounds 990m. The shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September, just
before the group announced a collapse in profits. The increase since then
has been fuelled by speculation that Lucas was vulnerable to predators.

Virgin's boss, has not brought the controversy to an end. Instead, its past
efforts to discredit and undermine its tiny competitor have continued to
attract public attention.
So far, though BA's reputation has been harmed, its business has suffered
little damage. But the airline knows that unless its board acts promptly,
there is a risk the affair could spiral out of control.
The airline's directors will gather today. Mr Charles Price, a former US
ambassador to Britain and a BA non-executive board member, is flying in from
the US. Lord White, a friend of Lord King and chairman of Hanson's US
operations, cannot attend because he is ill.
At the forefront of directors' minds will be the wave of criticism the
airline has faced. Big institutional investors have been privately
expressing their doubts about BA's handling of the crisis. More publicly,
members of the airline's own staff have been using harsh language to
criticise their bosses.
In the airline's staff newspaper, some employees wrote last week of 'grave
mistakes' in 'an obscene episode', and called for heads to roll.
Virgin has skilfully kept up the pressure, claiming some BA passengers have
switched to its aircraft as a result of the affair. Mr Branson has given BA
a deadline that expires next week to show that it has learnt its lesson. He
was dissatisfied with BA's first letter to him, and is still seeking an 'act
of good faith' to demonstrate that BA had changed its attitude to
competition. BA has since sent a second letter to Mr Branson asking him to
outline his thoughts.
Unless Mr Branson is satisfied with the outcome, he threatens to drag BA
through an anti-trust case in the US. This might hinder BA's renewed efforts
to clinch a partnership deal with USAir, the sixth largest US airline.
Though the stakes at today's board meeting are high, it is unlikely to lead
to sweeping management changes. Some personnel moves appear imminent, but
the intention will be to achieve the greatest possible impact from the
smallest possible changes among BA's top managers.
The key players in BA's boardroom drama include Lord King. He is due to step
down as chairman in the summer but still exerts considerable influence on
his colleagues. 'He is angry and upset but he is not about to run away
crying,' a BA insider said last night.
Sir Michael Angus, non-executive deputy chairman, has now emerged as the
pivotal figure on the board. Though he was reluctant to become involved when
the 'dirty tricks' allegations first surfaced, he has since played a central
role in attempts to repair the damage.
As a former chairman of Unilever and current president of the Confederation
of British Industry, Sir Michael is well-versed on issues of corporate
governance.
He has already ordered a second internal investigation to establish the full
extent of BA's campaign against Virgin. (An earlier report is now thought to
have left many issues unresolved.) The new report, prepared by Linklaters &amp;
Paines, BA's solicitors, is highly critical of aspects of the 'dirty tricks'
campaign. But the 80-page document is also thought to confirm that the
campaign was carried out by a few individual employees and did not involve
the highest levels of management.
Sir Michael has been mooted by some BA insiders as a possible successor to
Lord King, at least for an interim period. Under that proposal, Sir Colin
Marshall, BA's chief executive and the other deputy chairman, would remain
as chief executive during what is already being dubbed the 'Angus
interregnum'.
However, Sir Michael says he is not anxious to become chairman and he has
not been asked to do so. He said last night: 'Everything is feasible in an
emergency but I don't think it will occur.'
The odds, therefore, remain that Sir Colin will become both chairman and
chief executive as originally planned, rather than waiting for the expiry of
an interim chairmanship held by Sir Michael.
Mr Robert Ayling, head of the marketing and operations, is being tipped to
assume a newly created position of managing director, bolstering the
airline's top management.
The most immediate casualties are likely to come in the legal and public
relations departments, which handled BA's response to Virgin's complaints of
'dirty tricks'.
Mr Brian Basham, an independent public relations consultant hired by BA, has
already been dropped by the company. BA is now relying on Sir Tim Bell,
former adviser to Lady Thatcher, for public relations advice.
The position of Mr David Burnside, BA's head of public affairs, is expected
to come under close scrutiny by the directors today.
The airline's strategy includes the possible setting up of a compliance
committee, formed of non-executives, to draw up and enforce a new code of
conduct for the company.
The intention of today's meeting is to try to end the 'dirty tricks' saga as
quickly as possible - ideally this week.
But BA's efforts may yet be frustrated.
Though ministers are anxious to keep the government on the sidelines, they
may not be able to do so if the issue continues to stay in the headlines.
Plenty of other interested parties - ranging from Virgin to European
airlines angered by BA's recent acquisitions in the UK and France - are
happy to keep it there. British Airways is still some way from clear skies.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
As the board meets, directors ponder how to address ..
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lord King, 75-year-old chairman of BA and architect of the airline's
success, will retire as chairman in July and become president
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir Colin Marshall, deputy chairman and chief executive, is still
expected eventually to take over as chairman. His position as chief
executive appears secure
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir Michael Angus leads BA's non-executive directors. He could be asked
to become interim chairman even though reluctant to take on the job
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lord White, chairman of Hanson's UK operation, is another non-executive
director and a close friend of Lord King
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Ayling, BA's head of marketing and operations, is tipped to
become managing director
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek Stevens, BA's chief financial officer and a board member, has
been sounding out institutional investors
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
David Burnside, BA's director of public affairs, could be threatened by
the Virgin affair
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's former public relations guru, is
helping BA in its damage-limitation exercise
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Basham, City of London public relations expert, is no longer
advising BA
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ..shareholders' concerns
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the latest ShareMonitor data, BA's largest shareholders
are Templeton Galbraith Hansberger with 5.5 per cent, Fidelity with
4.5 per cent and Schroeder Asset Management with 3.9 per cent.
Prudential Assurance and Standard Life are shown as having notifiable
stakes of over 3 per cent. Since then at least one shareholder,
Fidelity, has disposed of almost its entire position and the Prudential
and Standard Life stakes have fallen below 3 per cent

FT  21 JAN 93 / German solidarity pact wins crucial support of IG Metall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMAN chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans for drastic government savings and
higher taxes to bolster the east German economy ran into a barrage of
criticism from left and right yesterday.
But his plans to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with employers and trade
unions, centred on the savings package, appear to be on course, with crucial
support coming from IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering workers' union.
The federation of German industry (BDI) backed the cuts in public spending,
but attacked plans for tax rises as creating new economic uncertainty.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and chief architect of the annual DM20bn
(Pounds 8.2bn) cuts, is expected to present the deal to the Bundesbank
today. While he warned against hopes of immediate interest rate cuts from
the central bank, he said the package should have a 'positive' effect on
future decisions.
In another move seen as hopeful in negotiations on the solidarity pact,
which would open the way for a relaxation in the bank's monetary policy, two
leading state premiers agreed to co-ordinate their negotiating positions. Mr
Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat leader in the eastern state of
Saxony, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Social Democrat premier of the Saarland and
deputy leader of the opposition party, agreed on a joint strategy at a
surprise meeting in Dresden.
As the rest of the Social Democrats, and most of the German media, expressed
consternation at the government's proposed cuts in social spending, and
abolition of tax allowances, as well as a DM10bn increase in the 1993 budget
deficit, the insiders in the talks were far more sanguine.
A spokesman for IG Metall welcomed several main concessions from the
government, spelt out in the federal consolidation programme published on
Tuesday.
They include a willingness to preserve east German enterprises in order to
restructure them, even if they cannot be sold by the Treuhand privatisation
agency by the end of 1994, as well as an increase in investment subsidies
for business in the east. Another important concession welcomed by the union
was the agreement to raise oil taxes in 1994 to finance the debt burden of
German railways.
One element of the package was abandoned last night in talks with the
parliamentary parties backing the government coalition, when Mr Waigel
agreed to drop a plan to means test children's allowances, and instead cut
'education' payments made to all mothers of new babies. But leaders of the
opposition SPD claimed that the package was still 'socially imbalanced'.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Spurt in house sales raises hope of revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE SALES have risen sharply in the past two months, according to estate
agents, builders and mortgage lenders, indicating that a revival may have
begun in the UK housing market.
December is normally a poor month for sales, which have continued to
increase in the first few weeks of this year. Prices, which have fallen
steeply since 1988, may also have begun to stabilise, according to a survey
of more than 150 estate agents published yesterday.
More than 40 per cent of agents questioned by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said prices had remained static during the three months
to the end of December. This compared with only 25 per cent reporting stable
prices in October and November.
It added: 'There are positive signals that the four-year decline in prices
may be coming to an end. Agents in all regions have reported marked
increases in levels of confidence and activity.'
The recent improvement was confirmed by Halifax, the country's biggest
building society, which said that mortgage applications since mid-November
had risen by about 10 per cent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier.
'This is a step in the right direction but we have been in this position
before only to see demand slip back as economic conditions have worsened,'
said the society.
It added that buyers were being encouraged by house prices, which were the
lowest for more than a decade compared with average earnings.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said reservations by would-be
purchasers had 'risen noticeably during the first few weeks of the year'.
Wimpey said January sales were more than a fifth higher than at the
beginning of last year.
The improvement, although from a very low base, was encouraging, the company
said. It was premature, however, to talk about a sustained recovery.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Bosnian Serbs ratify peace plan: Moslems agree ceasefire
with Croatian allies after mediators intervene
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Serbs yesterday approved by an unexpectedly large majority the
first stage of an international peace plan, which their leader, Dr Radovan
Karadzic, accepted in Geneva last week under extreme duress.
Their hands raised in the Serbian Orthodox three-fingered salute, 55
deputies of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament voted in favour of the
constitutional principles for a future state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, with 15
against.
The result was deceptive, achieved after two days of fierce debate during
which most deputies attacked the international community and pledged never
to forego 'holy Serbian goals'.
The vote coincided with agreement by Bosnia's Moslem leaders to an immediate
ceasefire after recent clashes with their nominal Croatian allies. This
followed the intervention of international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia had
flown to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, yesterday for talks with President
Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and his prime minister, Mile Akmedzic.
Earlier, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, had ordered his troops to
stop fighting Moslems over disputed territory. After the vote by Bosnian
Serbs and the Moslem-Croat truce, it was announced that peace talks would be
resumed in Geneva on Saturday.
Although the Bosnian Serbs have formally accepted the constitutional
framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, providing for a unitary state divided into
10 semi-autonomous provinces, it was clear that most deputies were still
deeply opposed.
'We have to choose between war and peace,' Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the
hardline speaker of the Bosnian assembly, said. 'The decision was taken
under international pressure and threats of isolation.' His statement was a
clear reference to the pressure to which Mr Karadzic and the deputies had
been subjected by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, anxious to see an
end to the conflict and international sanctions against Serbia.
At the assembly meeting in a converted canteen, Serbian leaders assured
deputies they were not renouncing the creation of a separate Bosnian Serbian
republic. They emphasised that the most vital part of the Geneva peace
process still lay ahead - talks on the detailed map of the provinces into
which the country would be divided.
Croatia and Slovenia were yesterday admitted to the International Monetary
Fund, allowing them to join the World Bank and giving them access to IMF
loans, writes George Graham in Washington.
Croatia can expect a quota of SDR261.6m (Pounds 237.5m), while Slovenia's
quota will be SDR150.5m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yet again there is talk of a revival in the housing sector. Yet again
investors run the risk of disappointment. Shares in building materials and
construction companies have been pushed up firmly as expectations have
grown. Both sectors have outperformed the market by around 20 per cent in
the past three months. There seems little room for more.
The good news is that the straws in the wind suggesting renewed activity in
the housing market are rapidly turning into a small haystack. Housing
showrooms and estate agencies have reportedly been buzzing with activity.
Prices appear to have found a floor. Even the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors suggests the housing market is finally stabilising.
But the evidence is still patchy. Repossessions and rising unemployment are
likely to sap confidence for a while to come. Besides, any resurgence in the
housing market will take time to feed through into profits for building
materials companies and housebuilders. The biggest of them, such as Tarmac
and Wimpey, appear too financially constrained to exploit any surge in
demand for new houses. The purer players, such as Wilson Bowden, Berkeley
and Bryant, are far more likely to benefit. But the market has hardly
neglected their charms. Most are trading on historic multiples of around 20.
That looks expensive when recovery will be protracted.

FT  21 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone's juicy margins cannot last forever, so evidence of approaching
competition from Mercury might be expected to unsettle investors. Yet the 8
per cent fall in Vodafone's shares in the past two days is slightly
irrational. Mercury's deal for cheap connection charges with BT primarily
relates to the price of incoming calls - a factor unlikely to prompt
subscribers to move from Vodafone's system to Mercury's personal
communications network, due later in the year.
More worrying is the thought that Mercury may price outgoing calls cheaply
too, substantially undercutting existing cellular providers. Vodafone has a
number of responses including new pricing packages and the beginnings of a
new cellular system similar to Mercury's. As Mercury is only starting in the
M25 area, Vodafone may cede market share rather than cut prices initially.
But eventually, as Mercury becomes established, Vodafone will be
increasingly forced to compete on price. The timing of this battle will
determine the company's earnings prospects.
Vodafone's natural inclination may be to defer price cuts on its existing
system. Particularly so because Mercury's system - restricted to London and
using untried technology - may have limited appeal to customers. But the
response of Cellnet, the other cellular network, could upset that
calculation. Cellnet started the move towards lower rental charges in the
autumn and has no product similar to the new Mercury or Vodafone systems. If
it cuts prices in a bid to maintain market share, Vodafone will have to
follow.

The Bundesbank cannot be best pleased with the way the budget debate is
developing in Germany. The agreement that is taking shape looks likely to
involve a much larger 1993 deficit than had hitherto been expected, while
some of the more significant tax increases may not take effect till 1995.
The disappointment may slow the pace of interest rate cuts later this year,
though it is unlikely to reverse the gradual easing signalled two weeks ago.
It would have been rash to have expected any significant move as early as
today's council meeting. Pressure on the French franc has abated so there is
no currency market reason to cut rates. The central bank will almost
certainly want to keep up the pressure on public sector workers to accept a
reasonable pay settlement. For the sake of its credibility it may also want
to wait till the January money supply figure becomes available. This is
likely to show a sharp deceleration since it will be the first monthly
figure to be calculated off the high base established during the final
quarter of 1992.
The Bundesbank may have to acknowledge that little more can be achieved on
the budget, especially since it is clearly growing more worried about the
state of the economy. But the old pattern whereby slowdown leads to steep
falls in rates may not be repeated if the budget deficit starts pushing up
yields in the bond market.

Try as one might, it is difficult to avoid drawing negative conclusions from
the December retail figures. This is not so much because there was a monthly
fall of 0.7 per cent when the market was expecting a small rise. The overall
movement masked a significant difference between gains for large store
chains and smaller, specialist shops which suffered a sharp fall-off in
business. It is the probable explanation for this trend which gives rise to
the underlying disappointment.
Not only do there appear to be specific areas of weakness such as music and,
given Ratners' position in the market, jewellery. The fall in sales at
smaller shops would be consistent with anecdotal evidence of a rush emerging
only at the end of the Christmas shopping period. Smaller shops do not have
the stock-carrying capacity to cope with that. The benefits would more
likely accrue to larger stores who also have the muscle to discount
aggressively.
Consumers thus appear still reluctant to part with their money unless
offered a good deal on price, a conclusion which can also be drawn from CBI
figures this week. Whether that will prompt a fresh cut in interest rates,
as the market seemed to assume yesterday, is another matter. The government
does not have much room left to cut. It would be natural to wait if possible
till the budget.
Besides, it is a moot point whether another rate cut would do much to excite
consumers who have other things on their minds: fear of unemployment, tax
rises and low income growth for those in work. Unless the government can
find a way out of this vicious circle, the danger remains that lack of
confidence could lead business to cut capacity further. The trend line of UK
economic growth would then fall and the budget deficit would become chronic.

In the wake of the hard sell and the soft sell, now the death sell.
On the same day as the British government is urged by a Commons select
committee to join in the banning of tobacco advertisements across Europe, a
poster advertising campaign is launched by a company which, like its
products, is called Death Cigarettes.
'We are selling cigarettes in a progressive, responsible way, advertising
the truth behind cigarettes, that they are dangerous and debilitating. At
the same time we donate 10 per cent of our profits to cancer research,'
company finance director Sten Bertelsen explains gravely.

Hot tip from Hong Kong: Feng Shui says the Year of the Cockerel is going to
be another bumper year for the local stock market, the world's top performer
last year.
It's not as daft as it sounds, if a Feng Shui index invented by Credit
Lyonnais Securities (Asia) for the Year of the Monkey, which ends this
weekend, is as accurate as it was last year. In terms of calling the market
turns it proved far more deadly than any of Hong Kong's research teams -
including Credit Lyonnais' own bunch.
Feng Shui, an ancient Chinese predictive art, involves study of the
relationship between basic elements, such as water and wind. It also
utilises the Chinese calendar. The Cockerel is an autumn animal, so punters
can look forward to a much stronger second half of the year. The Feng Shui
chartists are highly optimistic. Not so Credit Lyonnais' analysts who are
increasingly nervous about the robed Feng Shui disciples encamped in a
corner of their office.

The most notable thing about the government's New Horizons for Women
exhibition, which employment secretary Gillian Shephard opened in Manchester
yesterday, was that there was only one proper employer among the 36
exhibitors - Tesco.
The Conservative Women's Association, the TUC, the Soroptimists and the
Pre-School Play Groups Association are jolly good things, but they can't do
much to reduce the number of women in the dole queues.

As if tiptoeing between a pair of hungry lions, most foreign dignitaries
arriving in Jerusalem say nothing apt to provoke either Israelis or
Palestinians. But Kyrgyzstan's president Askar Akayev is clearly no such
pussyfooter.
Warmly welcomed by Israel's president Chaim Herzog as the first visiting
head of state from the former Soviet Union's mainly Moslem central Asian
republics, he proclaimed: 'I pray to Almighty God for the long-awaited
independence of the people of Palestine.' Whereupon foreign minister Shimon
Peres observed tartly: 'We are going to hold a dialogue with our guest.'
Peres clearly has powers of persuasion. Yesterday his ministry triumphantly
announced that Kyrgyzstan has agreed to follow Costa Rica and El Salvador in
housing its embassy in Jerusalem - hub of of the Arab-Israeli conflict,
which few nations recognise as the Israeli capital.
Even so, Akayev may well have left one lion purring in Israel at the price
of finding the other roaring back home. His Moslem brethren in the Arab
world and elsewhere will no doubt now want a dialogue with him in their
turn.

While it's puzzling how something best known for insolvency can be digested,
that is what looks to be happening to Cork Gully after its merger with
Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Like Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells which went the same way beforehand, the
insolvency specialist is seeing its name disappear. Its annual commentary
has this year been retitled the Coopers review, for instance, and top Cork
Gully staff appearing in public are labelled as Coopers partners.
Could someone have decided that, much as the 1986 insolvency act is the kiss
of death to corporate recoveries, the old name bestows a hangman's handshake
on struggling companies?

One of the first things on Bill Clinton's agenda, now that he is safely
ensconced in the White House, is to decide what to do with America's
overseas ambassadors. There are 162 of them who, unless told otherwise, must
be out of their embassies within six weeks.
All of the politically appointed envoys will almost certainly be made
redundant. While the 127 who are career diplomats may lose their embassies,
however, they will not be out of a job.
One of the 127 is America's highly popular ambassador to the UK, Ray Seitz,
whose future is arousing intense interest among Brits.
John Major, nervous about any Clinton backlash following his party's support
for President Bush's re-election campaign, has not concealed his hopes that
Seitz will be reappointed. Many others of all political colours share that
view.
Has Britain erred by lobbying too aggressively for Seitz?
History suggests he won't keep the job. One has to go back to the early
years of this century to find a US ambassador in London surviving a change
of president. Whitelaw Reed served Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Taft. But
they were both Republicans - only John Hay, who served Presidents Cleveland
and McKinley in the 1890s, withstood a change of presidential party.
Seitz may survive because he is the first non-political figure to hold the
job. If he doesn't, the danger for Major is that it will be seen as another
blow for the 'special relationship'.

An executive in a big US insurance group confesses that it throws out
unopened the annual reports of companies in which it invests. This group,
along with many others, now relies on computers to guide its investment
policy rather than analysis. This trend , however, can lead to imprudent
investment.
The insurance company's investments are largely driven by the
pseudo-scientific techniques of group rotation. This involves investors
shifting their portfolios from, say, defence stocks to regional banks. All
the subtleties and nuances of a particular business escape them. Either they
do not care, because they are trading a particular industrial sector as a
whole, or they do not know, because their computers miss so many
fine-grained distinctions.
Those computers suffer from two big handicaps. First, they cannot see what
is going on in the world. Being strong on history but weak on current
events, they can only reason by analogy from the past.
Second, faced with the overload of too many unquantifiable forces at work -
the Bundesbank, the collapse of the Soviet empire, to name two - the
computer does what any of us with an instinct for survival would do - it
ducks. It focuses on one or two factors and makes believe all the other
variables will remain constant.
Computers, of course, are not the real problem; the problem is us. Rather
than attach great weight to matters which are inherently uncertain, we cling
to the facts about which we feel more confident, even though they may be
less relevant.
The increasingly popular alternative to sector rotation and other such
active strategies has been to become passive, and track the market indices.
By some estimates a third of US pension fund equities are now indexed - they
consist of a selection of stocks that match those of a top market index,
such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. For an indexer, there is no need to read
financial statements.
The asset allocators and the indexers, who now control a majority of US
pension funds and other managed equities, may seem worlds apart, yet they
have much in common. Active or passive, the focus has not been on particular
businesses but always on the market. Beat it by a nanosecond (the actives)
or join it (the passives).
A more appropriate programme is both simple and difficult. The simple part
is to think small and establish whether a company has a well-defined market
position, an excellent balance sheet, an ability to weather industry
downturns, a good management and a reasonable share price. The difficult
part is to buy against the crowd.
Keynes wrote to a friend 50 years ago: 'To suppose that safety first
consists in having a small gamble in a large number of different directions
. . . as compared with a substantial stake in a company where one's
information is adequate, strikes me as a travesty of investment policy.'
Keynes felt he could not know more than a few companies at a time. Peter
Lynch, who ran Fidelity's large Magellan fund for many years, kept track of
hundreds, but then he hardly slept.
My larger concern is that US institutions, which now manage more than half
the country's equities, up from one-third in 1980, are ignoring their social
responsibility through computer-driven investing. By focusing, for example,
on short-term performance criteria, US institutions sold some big airlines
in the 1980s to unsuitable buyers, not caring what happened to the employees
or the millions who depended on their services.
Officers responsible for corporate pension funds could mitigate these
problems by insisting that equity managers hold no more than 20 stocks and
that they maintain an average holding period of at least two years. They
could also require that the managers put a big part of their personal wealth
in the fund they manage.
Computers cannot fathom the reach of the human spirit or the depth of our
frailties; they are indifferent to social effects. This capitalism of
computer analytics, this capitalism without knowledgeable and committed
capitalists, lends itself to abuse that the larger community cannot
countenance for long.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLINTON'S inauguration marks a watershed. His will be the first post-cold
war presidency; he himself is the first president born after the second
world war. The desires of the American people meet the instincts of Mr
Clinton in the belief that renewal starts at home. But it cannot end there.
By what he does and what he fails to do, he will define not merely the
future of his own country, but that of the world as a whole.
He acknowledged this in an inaugural address whose purpose was
inspirational. 'There is no clear division today between what is foreign and
what is domestic' he said. 'The world economy, the world environment, the
world Aids crisis, the world arms race affect us all.' The US remains the
indispensable global leader, but acting in that capacity is also in its own
interests. Mr Clinton's challenge is to link his domestic objectives to his
country's global role. To succeed he must show not just his intelligence,
which is evident, nor his political skill, which is unquestionable, but his
capacity to choose. The formation of his cabinet gave something to almost
every interest. His presidency must not.
Fortunately for Mr Clinton, his opportunity to make things happen is
exceptional. The American economy is recovering, which means he can eschew
short-term fixes. Congress is dominated by his own party. That could be said
of Jimmy Carter as well. But the Democrats of today are both desperate for
success and fearful of the American people's reaction to failure. To this
receptivity at home must be added fluidity abroad. With the collapse of
communism, the shape of the global polity can be refashioned. Others may
influence where the world will go, but nobody can rival Bill Clinton in his
capacity to determine the outcome.
Choice starts at home. The new president should leave economic recovery in
the capable hands of Mr Alan Greenspan and focus instead, on two strategic
issues: the role and financing of American government and reform of the
American health system.
A credible programme to eliminate the budget deficit is urgent. Since the US
needs more public investment and probably more current spending as well, the
answer is higher taxes. The introduction of a value added tax is the best
solution. Higher taxation of petrol could be a complement. Reform of the
health system to provide adequate coverage for all, at a bearable cost, will
prove both technically and politically difficult. It is nevertheless
essential.
Internationally, Mr Clinton has the chance to help create a truly global
liberal economy, one of the great objectives of postwar US statesmanship.
But first Mr Clinton must resist the inclination of some Americans towards
narrow-minded mercantilism and of others towards a short-sighted moralism.
Some of those who surround the new president believe that the best way to
spread human rights is to withdraw opportunities to trade. They are wrong,
particularly in the the most important case, that of China. Others believe
that the success of American industry requires an aggressively unilateralist
trade policy. They too are wrong. To be effective even in its own terms, US
industrial policy has to be disciplined by the international rules that have
so long been a goal of US policy. Completing the Uruguay Round is in US
interests. So too is greater support for Mr Yeltsin's reforms than afforded
in practice by Mr Bush.
Mr Clinton's in-tray is full, but he has a brief opportunity to set his own
agenda. He will be a successful president only if he makes the hard choices
that he blurred in his search for the office. He must also persuade the
American people and fellow politicians to accept what he decides. Yesterday,
he asked his fellow citizens to break the 'bad habit of expecting something
for nothing'. He will need all his political skills to make that message
stick.

FT  21 JAN 93 / A long way to go, but little time: The German government's
savings package is a tough response to budget pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be honestly admitted, even in the most loyal circles surrounding
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that his ambitious savings plan to finance the
soaring costs of German unification has gone down like a lead balloon.
The 50-page 'federal consolidation programme', painfully negotiated by Mr
Theo Waigel, the finance minister, with his coalition partners and published
on Tuesday, spares no one in its distribution of the cuts. It is one of the
most comprehensive attempts to reduce both social spending and industrial
subsidies to have been made by a post-war German government.
The programme, which involves cuts of DM20bn (Pounds 8.20bn) a year by 1995,
is intended as the federal government's main contribution to a 'solidarity
pact' with the opposition, the 16 lander (state) governments, trade unions
and employers, to pay for unification and revive the collapsed east German
economy.
Yet it has pleased no one, not even the parliamentary parties backing the
ruling coalition.
A clear majority of west German electors say they are not prepared to give
up any of their income to pay for the costs of unification; that is what
they are being asked to do.
Equally, it is clear that east German leaders do not think that the modest
amounts of extra cash being liberated will seriously dent the problems ahead
of them.
As for the budget disciplinarians, including the German Bundesbank, who have
been demanding radical action by the state to reduce its bloated deficits,
the package simply does not go far enough. The shock of Tuesday was that,
far from keeping the federal government's net borrowing requirement under
control in the current year, the plan would actually push it up another
DM10bn (Pounds 4.10bn) to DM53bn. The cause is a drop in tax revenues and an
increase in unemployment costs resulting from the downturn in the German
economy.
Coming on the same day as a long-heralded and lacklustre Cabinet reshuffle,
the package would appear to demonstrate the widely held view in German
political circles that the Kohl administration is adrift without ideas.
The reality is inevitably rather more complicated.
For a start, perhaps the most positive response to the whole solidarity pact
package came yesterday from the least likely source - the mighty IG-Metall
engineering workers' union. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union leader, has been
negotiating quietly with Chancellor Kohl for months. All the indications
yesterday were that he was still very much on board to do a deal on the
solidarity pact.
Officially, the union went out of its way to welcome several of the
principal aspects which emerged from the government's proposals, all of
which were answers to trade union demands made in the talks.
They include the public acceptance that east German enterprises which cannot
be sold by the Treuhand privatisation agency, and yet which offer some hope
of becoming profitable in the long run, can be preserved as 'federal
industrial properties'. That amounts, according to Mr Jorg Barczynski, the
union spokesman, to a '180-degree turn in Treuhand policy'.
This concession is complemented by an increase in the investment subsidy
payable to small-scale east German businesses from the current 8 per cent of
planned investment to 20 per cent.
The government has also accepted an increase in the oil tax, from January 1
1994, to help finance the debt burden of the German railway system.
And finally it has agreed - not explicitly in the document, but according to
an assurance by Chancellor Kohl - that the government will not attempt to
enforce, through legislation, a renegotiation of wage contracts in east
Germany. These contracts offer eastern German workers wage parity with their
counterparts in the west by 1994. A significant slowing of that process is
demanded by the employers, but Mr Kohl has said that it must be negotiated
with the unions and not imposed by the government.
As for the other government spending cuts, they are still being weighed up
in the union's Frankfurt headquarters.
What the package put forward by Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel does demonstrate,
nonetheless, is the ever-shrinking room for manoeuvre of the German
government between the Scylla and Charybdis of east German structural
collapse, and west German economic recession.
On the political front that is compounded by the creaking processes of life
in a coalition, where every government shake-up has to be dictated by the
party balance, and acceptable to all. As the reshuffle demonstrated, it
means that the least possible change is the most acceptable solution.
Given that reality, the consolidation package looks rather more impressive,
and rather more comprehensive in its ambitions than it has yet been given
credit for.
With a combination of spending cuts and backdoor tax rises, through
abolishing a variety of special tax breaks and allowances, Mr Waigel has
managed to find savings by 1995 - the first year they all become effective -
of some DM20bn.
That is the crunch year for the financing of unification. All the
accumulated debts, totalling at least DM400bn, including those of the
Treuhand and the German unity fund, in which the whole panoply of old East
German debt has been collected, will then be transferred to the cost of the
central exchequer.
Against a financing gap in 1995 currently estimated at DM110bn - DM45bn for
the debt servicing, and DM65bn for subsidising the impoverished eastern
lander - savings of DM20bn may appear decidedly modest. Mr Waigel has
announced his intention to reintroduce the 'solidarity surcharge' on income
tax to help bridge the gap. He has also started to slim some sacred cows.
He plans to introduce means tests for both children's allowances and the
generous subsidy given for new babies; he plans to cut back unemployment
benefits, in a bid to keep them below minimum wages; and he is proposing, to
the horror of the property-owning classes, a 50 per cent cut in tax relief
on mortgages on old houses.
He is also launching a new attack on the direct subsidies paid to
agriculture, coal-mining and ship-building, all defended by formidable
political lobbies.
The package thus appears to be a significant step in the direction of one of
the principal demands of Mr Tyll Necker, president of the federation of
Germany industry, the BDI - that it should create a 'psychology of saving'
not just in the public sector, but in the population at large.
The savings programme has, however, more precise and immediate aims which
may prove more elusive. Most pressing is the intention, spelt out precisely
by Mr Waigel in his plan, of persuading the German Bundesbank that it now
has the necessary 'room for manoeuvre for interest rate reductions'.
Given the immediate DM10bn rise in this year's net borrowing requirement,
that is questionable. The central bank was not giving the slightest hint
yesterday of its reaction. In Frankfurt banking circles, however, there was
a clear feeling that the package so far has not helped the bank to budge.
The truth is that the Bundesbank is insisting on seeing clear downwards
movement in the underlying trends of both inflation and money supply, before
it will relax its principal interest rates. It believes that movement is
coming, but it is still not quite visible yet. The combination of a 1
percentage point increase in value-added tax on January 1, and administered
price rises in eastern Germany, mean that both January and February are
likely to see headline inflation figures of about 4 per cent again - an
upwards blip - before the downward trend to 3 per cent resumes.
Yet the domestic and international pressure for interest rate cuts is
becoming hard to resist. German government and industry fear that the
current downturn could persist long after mid-year - the hoped-for turning
point - if interest rates stay too high too long. And failure to move German
rates down before the French elections in March could cause renewed pressure
on the French franc.
If a solidarity pact can be agreed before then, it would give the Bundesbank
just the credibility fig-leaf it needs to move.
That is the immediate gamble Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel have undertaken. In the
long term, the figures for paying off the 'burden of the past' in east
Germany still look grim. But if they cannot get the German economy moving
again before 1994 - election year - then the pain of paying for unification
will be stretched well past the end of the century.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Airtours bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOSTILE bid by Airtours, Britain's third biggest package tour company,
for Owners Abroad, its larger rival, poses an interesting test for
competition policy. If the deal goes through, it will create a group with
almost a third of the UK package tour business, above the 25 per cent market
share which would normally prompt a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Airtours appears confident, nonetheless, that the Office of Fair Trading
will not recommend a reference. Whatever private reassurances it may have
received, the company can point to the MMC investigation into the 1988
takeover of Horizon by Thomson, the market leader. Though that deal also
breached the 25 per cent threshold, it was cleared by the MMC, which found
that vigorous competition would continue.
That view has been vindicated by subsequent price wars and by evidence that
Thomson's market share has fallen since the merger. However, circumstances
may have changed. While the Thomson takeover created one big group in an
otherwise highly fragmented market, the Airtours deal would create a duopoly
accounting for some two-thirds of package tour sales.
Such an outcome need not be against the public interest. Duopolists compete
fiercely in industries like soft drinks. In package tours, the emergence of
larger groups may even yield consumer benefits by bringing much-needed
stability. There may also be opportunities for larger operators to reap
scale economies, for example in hotel bookings.
The task for policy is to ensure that competitive pressures push these gains
on to consumers. The principal issue is less duopoly per se than the trend
to vertical integration. If the merger succeeds, the two biggest tour
operators will also control three of the UK's charter airlines and almost a
third of package tour sales.
There is a risk that dominant groups might discriminate against independent
competitors by, for example, denying them access to charter capacity in boom
times and refusing to sell their products when demand is weak. If the
Airtours merger is allowed to proceed, the OFT should make clear its
determination to prevent any such abuses. Better still, the MMC should be
asked to examine the package tour business in depth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S PUBLIC row in the European Parliament, between the Danish
foreign minister and Greek deputies, over Greek resistance to the diplomatic
recognition of Macedonia was a lamentable distraction. Greek fears that an
independent Macedonia might harbour territorial ambitions are too obsessive.
But Mr Ellemann-Jensen did not enhance his role as the new president of the
Community by engaging in a public slanging match.
Moreover, the row distracted attention from the rest of the Community's
agenda during the next six months. The overriding priority is to secure the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty, by Denmark and by Britain. In the
meantime, the most important innovation will be the opening of membership
negotiations with four applicant countries from Efta. Externally, the
Community must work on strengthening co-operation with the US, starting with
a serious effort to secure an agreement on the long-delayed Uruguay trade
negotiation.
The problem with Mr Ellemann-Jensen's straightforward presentation was that
it skirted round the profound policy conundrums which surround the
Maastricht treaty, the programme for economic and monetary union, and the
prospective enlargement of the Community. These conundrums are fundamental
and urgently need to be addressed.
First, what is really left of the policy objectives contained in the
Maastricht treaty after the Danish opt-outs? Ostensibly, these concessions
are unique to Denmark; but the Danish precedent implicitly renders all
Maastricht commitments more voluntary. This problem could be critical for
the enlargement negotiations: it will certainly be difficult for Denmark as
president to insist that Sweden must shoulder obligations which Denmark
itself has chosen to evade.
Second, what can be done to restore credibility to the programme for
economic and monetary union, after the storm of Black Wednesday? Though the
turmoil seems to have subsided somewhat, the system is manifestly under
systemic strain and speculative pressures are likely to recur right up to
the French elections in March, and beyond. Whether or not monetary union is
still a credible objective, the source of these tensions needs to be
identified and addressed.
Third, the enlargement negotiations will require an overhaul of the EC
institutions: with 16 members the Community will need more streamlined
decision-making rules, and a reduction in the voting premium enjoyed by
small countries. This is a deeply contentious issue, but it risks becoming
insoluble if it is not tackled now.

<TEXT>
The first report of the new House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service
Committee is like a curate's egg: good in parts. It contains more quotable
sharp remarks but is less consistent than the reports of its predecessor
under Sir Terence Higgins.
Nevertheless, the section on the departure from the ERM on Black Wednesday,
September 16, is singularly unrevealing, as members were too credulous of
official excuses, especially from the Bank of England. What needed to be
explained was not the desperation-born increases in base rates to 15 per
cent on September 16 itself, but the losses incurred in continuing to
support sterling when, as the official witnesses themselves confirmed, they
realised they were in the monetary equivalent of the Charge of the Light
Brigade.
The only excuse heard by protesting members of the inner cabinet is that
suspending membership before the close of European markets might have been a
breach of legal obligations - hardly an excuse that would have been used if
officials' own personal funds had been at stake. The committee's
recommendation that the losses from intervention (believed to be Pounds 2bn
to Pounds 3bn) should be published is only the beginning of the required
investigation; but even that is officially rejected.
'One of the world's least successful missions'
Meanwhile, I can add a little nugget. On Monday, September 14, a high-level
economic mission led by Alan Budd and Mervyn King, the chief economic
advisers to the Treasury and Bank respectively, visited first Frankfurt and
then Bonn to try to persuade their German opposite numbers that sterling, at
its DM2.95 entry rate into the ERM, was 'not obviously overvalued'.
The mission had arisen out of a conversation between Sir Nigel Wicks, UK
second Treasury permanent secretary, and Horst Kohler, state secretary of
the German finance ministry, and had been arranged the previous week -
between the disastrous meeting of Community finance ministers at Bath and
the weekend of the lira devaluation. One wag close to events decribed it as
'one of the world's least successful missions'. For it failed to shake the
Bundesbank's belief that sterling was overvalued.
Its members saw the high-powered Bundesbank economic adviser and board
member, Otmar Issing, who listened carefully but did not regard the time
appropriate for an academic discussion in view of the currency turmoil, and
emphasised that the Bonn government was responsible for parity negotiations.
The object of the Budd-King mission was:
To explain the case for the DM2.95 sterling rate.
To argue that sterling and the French franc were in the right relationship.
In other words, to persuade the Germans not to drive a wedge between Britain
and France in the degree to which their currencies were worth supporting.
They also tried to persuade the Bundesbank to see the current balance of
payments as a purely private sector problem which would take care of itself.
The British team found that their German opposite numbers were not aware of
some big UK economic changes, such as the slowdown in wages and the
productivity take-off.
The UK side was plainly right on unit labour costs. These were increasing in
the second half of 1992 by 2 per cent per annum, much less than in Germany -
although in France they were actually falling. On the payments deficit, the
UK mission was out of date because of the arrival of the 'twin deficits'
problem - payments and budget deficits.
The British visitors were under strict instructions not to discuss exchange
rate changes or realignments but to stick to long-term analysis. The
emphasis was on 'graphs and charts' and exchanges between 'card-carrying
economists'. This was surely something of a waste of officials of near
permanent secretary level in a growing emergency. The idea of a combined
high-level probe of fundamentals was a good one; but it was several months
too late.
During the discussions, the Germans behaved as if the British knew of the
realignment offer - which makes all the more surprising the British official
astonishment at Helmut Schlesinger's Handelsblatt interview and the selling
pressure against sterling.
The British government, in its innermost thinking, was prepared to support
an upward realignment confined to the D-Mark and its satellite currencies.
Crucial to such a realignment would have been French willingness to see the
franc fall against the D-Mark. Some British policymakers thought this would
happen if only the system could have pulled through until after the French
referendum on September 20.
In retrospect, close observers believe that the fatal mistake made at the
Bath European finance ministers' meeting on September 6 was to leave each
country to go its own way. The only chance of saving the ERM grid was to
have concerted statements by all the major actors and concerted interest
changes, including if necessary double or treble-digit day-to-day interest
rates in the period up to the French Maastricht referendum.
Where the franc is now
The British government view that the franc should follow sterling rather
than the D-Mark was always wishful thinking. Despite the unpopularity of
Mitterrand and slowly rising unemployment, the currency fundamentals are
more favourable to the franc than they ever were to sterling. France has
lower inflation, a better budgetary and balance of payments position, and a
less bad recession than Germany, let alone the UK.
The French government has already withstood two speculative attacks on the
franc in September and in January. A much larger attack is expected in the
run-up to the March parliamentary elections; and the Bundesbank is fully on
board for a combined defence.
Any commentator who ever drops his guard and believes official statements on
exchange rates is liable to end up with egg on his face, as I know to my
cost. The difference between the franc now and sterling last September is
that, if the French currency is forced into a temporary float, it may before
long rise against the D-Mark. Indeed Bundesbank members have said it is a
revaluation candidate. It is this knowledge, more than any government
statements or currency intervention, that is supporting the franc and making
speculators pause for thought.
Glasnost, no perestroika
The most quoted single phrase in the Commons committee's report was
'glasnost without the perestroika' to describe the the new economic
information offered by the Treasury.
This is not strictly accurate. For glasnost means openness. Yet despite the
new publications, the present UK system of government is anything but open.
As Norman Lamont told the committee: 'You will not know what advice is
tendered by officials or anyone else.' Whether he knew it or not, he was
simply repeating the orthodoxy of generations of permanent secretaries, who
regard the confidentiality of advice to ministers as the Ark of the
Covenant.
I came across this orthodoxy when I was foolhardly enough to send the proofs
of my book on the Treasury to the then permanent secretary. The upshot was a
lunch with the then chancellor, Reginald Maudling (courtesy of The Observer)
in which he jovially read me the riot act.
That he had been put up to it became clear some years later when he reviewed
the second edition very favourably and remarked that the text was accurate
wherever he was in a position to know.
The self-serving Whitehall view is that officials will not give honest
advice unless it is secret. It is just as likely that the advice will be
better if those giving it know it will be subject to public scrutiny.
In a responsible system, the Bank would have one set of duties and the
Treasury another set; and officials in both would account for their work. We
would know if the chancellor received bad advice or refused to take good
advice. By contrast, today everyone is responsible for everything and no one
is responsible for anything. Hence Black Wednesday and numerous other
disasters.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: A quick 'fix' will not resolve problems in
electricity supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J D RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Extra time for British Coal', January 14) was a useful
review of a possible subsidy for British Coal, but it said nothing about the
fundamental elements of the problem.
The present situation has arisen directly from the decisions made on
restructuring the electricity supply industry for privatisation. lf
generation had had a different structure (eg five or six fossil-fuel
generators instead of two) and if a different approach had been taken on
pricing - such as using the pool only as a merit order rather than a
price-setting mechanism - different decisions would have been made on new
investment and fuel selection.
A quick 'fix' in the form of a subsidy for British Coal will do nothing to
address the fundamental problems in electricity supply, which have given
rise not only to the problems in coal but also to excessive price increases
which are damaging British industry.
As major electricity consumers, and indeed as citizens, our members look to
the government to tackle the fundamental problems, so that we can progress
to a situation in which sensible decisions are made on fuel selection, and
electricity is supplied to industry at competitive prices.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: Russian arts need proper funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VERINA GLAESSNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Lloyd's article, 'The arts perform a dance of death' (January 16),
reads a mite pessimistically. Russian culture does indeed risk both
bastardisation and provincialism, but it has withstood worse. What is of
particular concern is the use of what funds are available. A fraction of the
cost of the 'operatic pageant' which Lloyd argues 'should have been' a
showcase event this summer could have enabled the reopening of the first few
splendidly restored rooms of the State Historical Museum, under the very
windows of which it was held. That museum, an architecturally unique 19th
century building, has breathtaking collections that travel the world but
remain invisible at home.
The government has appeared to lack any arts policy at all, but perhaps
there are signs of change. John Lloyd also fails to mention the question of
cost. Massive funding for films 'that three people saw' and musicians who
'never perform in public' is all very well, but people need running water
too.
A proper arts policy requires a solid safety net of government funding. This
implies a properly administered taxation system.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: Further means testing not right route to a modern
welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms FRAN BENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on Labour's Commission on Social Justice (January 18) poses
some of the problems involved in the extension of means-testing, but does
not resolve them. Underlying the article is an assumption that the only
legitimate aim for a social security system is the minimalist one of
relieving poverty after it has already struck; and that the only source of
finance for a better deal for people in poverty is the means-testing of
so-called 'universal' benefits. But a social security system in a
sophisticated modern society should be multi-purpose; and there are far more
obvious areas of expenditure (or foregone revenue) which could fund an
attack on poverty.
Child Poverty Action Group believes that an extension of means-tested
benefits is not an appropriate response to the call to 'modernise' the
welfare state.
First, it would not be able to respond to the current emphasis on individual
aspirations. It is very difficult to improve your own situation through your
own efforts if you are caught in the inevitable 'poverty trap' caused by
withdrawing means-tested benefits as well as paying extra tax and national
insurance contributions.
Second, further means-testing would inevitably move us further away from
individual rights to benefit for women; means-tested benefits are inevitably
assessed on the basis of the couple or family unit, in a way no longer
considered acceptable for income tax. Third, there seems now to be broad
agreement that state help should be enabling, not controlling - yet
means-testing gives enormous powers of intervention in the personal lives of
the means-tested, and means that even those in work are dependent more on
the state's decisions about benefit levels than they are on their own
efforts for their financial position.
Last but not least, it is difficult, if not impossible, for means-tested
benefits to give real 'social security' as a basis on which people can
experiment in today's changing labour market patterns, and on which children
can rely if their parent(s) move in and out of today's changing family
situations.
The arguments of today's pro-selectivists are not 'radical', as you claim;
they are just wrong. It is a pity that the Financial Times appears to have
joined the ranks of the new means-testers.

<TEXT>
CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL
By Noel Tichy and Stratford Sherman
Doubleday, Dollars 24, 374 pages
THE NEW GE
By Robert Slater
Business One Irwin, Dollars 24.95, 295 pages
Ask America's top business leaders which of their peers they admire most and
the name Jack Welch would almost certainly win the biggest vote.
Since taking over as chairman of General Electric in 1981, at the age of 45,
this restless, contentious and charismatic individual has engineered a
revolution in the running of one of the country's largest, most conservative
and complex business groups.
The financial results speak for themselves. GE has enjoyed strong
productivity and earnings growth for much of the past decade, and its share
price has more than quintupled. Yet all around it, former giants of US
industry have been falling flat on their faces, victims of inertia and
complacency. Control Your Destiny Or Someone Else Will - one of Welch's
favourite aphorisms and the title of Tichy and Sherman's book - could serve
as an epitaph for Robert Stempel, ousted last year as chairman of
slow-to-change General Motors. It might yet apply to John Akers, chairman of
IBM, which on Tuesday reported the biggest annual loss in corporate history.
The volume by academic Tichy and journalist Sherman is significant because
it is the first scholarly attempt to pin down the secret of GE's success.
Tichy, a professor of organisation at the University of Michigan School of
Business, can speak with authority about GE, since he has had a ring-side
seat at the Welch transition, both as a long-time consultant to the company
and as head of its executive training school for two years. But this hardly
makes him an impartial observer.
There appear to be three main elements to Welch's success. The first was his
realisation at the start of the 1980s that all was not well with GE, even
though the company was one of the most admired in the US. Welch, a brilliant
entrepreneur who had revitalised profits in every GE division he had run,
saw that the conglomerate's hodgepodge of businesses was ill-equipped to
compete in a world of intensifying global competition. He ruled that
henceforth every GE business must be first or second in its sector or face
disposal.
His second great achievement was having the guts to stick by this strategy
in the early 1980s as GE laid off thousands of workers, cut layers of
management and sold 125 businesses, while critics declared that he was
trying to mend a fine company which did not need fixing. He has never
entirely shed the label 'Neutron Jack', which the press pinned on him at
that time.
The third, which has taken place over the past five years, has been a
transformation more subtle, but arguably of far greater long-term
importance, in GE's business culture. Welch has been trying to create an
organisation which embraces change as inevitable, rather than resisting it;
where information flows freely around the group, rather than being jealously
hoarded; and where employees are given important powers to control their
working environment.
These ideas have been encapsulated best in 'work-out' - a programme begun in
1989 which involves small groups of employees from all levels of a business
getting together to thrash out common problems. They are encouraged to speak
freely, with the promise of no retribution from managers.
Worker participation in continuous improvement is hardly a new idea. What is
novel is the sheer scale and commitment of GE's endeavour. For example,
managers presented with ideas for change are required to say quickly whether
they support them or not. There can be no fudging.
Tichy and Sherman give a helpful, clear account of all these developments,
illustrating their case with interesting case studies of individual
businesses which have been turned around. But the book is marred by being
too reverential, devoting remarkably little space to the weak spots in
Welch's record. Tichy and Sherman do acknowledge, but do not delve deep
into, the fact that in 1985 the revolution had become so unpopular that
Welch 'slowed the very process of organisational change that he was so
urgently trying to accelerate. His efforts to change a corporation that most
people still regarded as healthy caused deep emotional trauma.'
Nor is there any substantial mention of GE's problems in running the NBC
television network, which ranked first in the US ratings when Welch acquired
it in 1986 but is now third. Are creative businesses poor candidates for the
GE treatment? The NBC saga is, however, covered at length by Slater, a
journalist and prolific author, whose racy and generally favourable account
of the Welch era is descriptive rather than analytical, yet touches on areas
where the management may be open to criticism.
It is Tichy's contention that Jack Welch will go down in history as one of
two 20th-century business leaders remembered for their ideas, alongside
Alfred Sloan, who thought up the modern corporate management structure when
he put together General Motors in the 1920s and 1930s.
This seems unlikely. For the ideas Welch espouses are either specific to GE
or interesting variations in the general stew of modern management theories,
which holds that the successful 21st-century business will need to be
participatory, not authoritarian.
Given the track record so far, what Welch will be remembered for is his
remarkable ability to articulate a vision for GE and then execute it
successfully. It calls for an unusual combination of intelligence,
leadership and communications skills, which cannot be learnt from reading GE
primers. Just ask Robert Horton, who rushed into the chairmanship of British
Petroleum with a revolutionary manifesto for cultural change that owed a lot
to Welch's track record at GE. Two years later he was ousted in a boardroom
coup.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: The failure of economic scientists - the alchemists
of the 20th century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN VIRDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his consideration of the qualifications of the new team in
Washington, Michael Prowse ('A wake-up call from Laura Tyson', January 18)
touches on a most important point, the role of the economic scientist in
20th century government. The 'science of economics' is in the same stage of
development as was pre-Renaissance chemistry, otherwise known as alchemy.
Alchemy was pursued as a way to make gold, literally: so is economics,
though more figuratively and with more impact on most people. Both fail for
the same reason.
The alchemists ignored (ignore means 'did not know') facts or behaviour of
the elements, so they failed to devise ways of control over what the
elements would do. So no gold.
The economists ignore the facts of behaviour of people, especially
collectively, so fail to devise rules which result in correct predictions.
Often this is not for want of trying. But meanwhile, both economists and
those who look to them for wisdom fail to see the failure and more and more
fog is generated by a self-perpetuating group of like-minded people.
Consulted, passionate, with no agreement among themselves, diverse, earnest
and wrong. So no gold; just like the alchemists]
A spark of light may be indicated by the most recent award of the Nobel
Prize for Economics to Gary Becker. He studied human behaviour first and
drew out supportable rules for prediction of economic consequences: just
like the early chemists looking for consistent behavioural rules, rather
than relying on fantasy equations and projections of hindsight. When
predictions become good enough to demonstrate predictable control rather
than just change, economics will become a useful tool of government.
Economists have far to go to be worthy of the title 'scientist'; that is,
one who knows.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: King Baby - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Robson is a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's The Archers. His new
play at The Pit perhaps helps to explain why that everyday story of country
folk sometimes becomes so tired and emotional. King Baby is set in a
rehabilitation unit for alcoholics. It is very intense, nothing much happens
and it lasts for three hours.
On the other hand, it is quite beautifully done. The dialogue is riveting
and the length is necessary to the theme, which is that people sometimes
drink to overcome boredom and without a drink time can seem to pass very
slowly.
King Baby works by a mixture of case studies and group therapy. There are
seven characters, all but one of whom is either a reformed alcoholic or
seeking to become so. Jimmy, who runs the unit, is there because his wife
was killed in a car crash while he was the drunken driver. Raymond, his
assistant, used to be an alcoholic ambulanceman.
Once when he ran somebody over, he drove him straight to the hospital and
people said how lucky the victim had been to be knocked down by an
ambulance. This is one of the few (chilling) laughs in the piece.
The rest are a social mix. Jimmy, the 70-year-old Irishman, says that the
English think his condition comes with the accent. There are two women, one
middle-aged, the other only 20. The hardest nut to crack is James King or
King Baby, the car dealer who used to make a lot of money 'when that sort of
thing was fashionable'. The problem is his pride: he does not want to admit
that he needs to be treated and is there only because his wife (the seventh
character in the play) has otherwise threatened to leave him.
The plot, such at it is, hangs on the breaking down of Jimmy. He despises
group therapy and at one stage ostentatiously reads the Financial Times
rather than take part in the exchanges.
At another he appears to be back on malt whisky until the bottle turns out
to contain only Tizer. But break down he does, in the end. By then everyone
has told their story, but there is a final twist.
The explanation of why King Baby became so disturbed in the first place is
conventionally feeble and it is not clear why there are so many references
to religion when the message is that alcoholism is a self-inflicted medical
disease, 'the most expensive club in the world with people dying to get in'.
Yet those are small matters. King Baby as it goes on becomes an addiction in
itself.
Jimmy is played by Lalor Roddy; his stature grows as the role develops. Tom
Georgeson's King has the occasional lapse in diction, but that may be part
of the act.
There is a wonderful vignette by Sheila Reid as the elder of the women
alcoholics. The smaller parts are faultless. The direction by Simon Usher
judges the pace with precision.

So far The Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00) has been an enjoyable
romp through the vagaries of our EC partners. Now it is our turn to squirm
as the spotlight swings on the UK through the eyes of French director
Patrick Le Gall. Predictably, he reckons we are class-ridden and racist,
characteristics that could be flung with some accuracy at the French.
Thursday night has become comedy night, built around Minder (ITV at 8.30).
Unfortunately it clashes with one of the better of the current comedy
sitcoms, The Brittas Empire (BBC 1), with Chris Barrie as the anti-hero who
runs his leisure centre with the delicacy of a power drill, and with Joking
Apart, a bitter look at divorce (BBC 2), but it leads to the subversive Dave
Allen (ITV, 9.30) and Drop the Dead Donkey (Channel 4, 10.00).
Despite its many awards and rave reviews (the media loves programmes about
the media) this parody of a TV newsroom can grind to an embarrassing halt
when the cast interrupt the plot to tell the weak topical jokes that the
writers think essential.
It is best when it concentrates on media bitchiness.

SWEET EMMA, DEAR BOBE (18) Istvan Szabo
SCHTONK] (15) Helmut Dietl
In Deep Cover, a jet-black, jet-paced crime thriller, there is one way to
distinguish the good guys from the bad. The good guys tend to call
themselves God: like small, mad-eyed police chief Charles Martin Smith,
drawing himself up to five feet two to insist on his omniscient divinity.
The bad guys (Gregory Sierra's succulently evil drug baron) tend to behave
like God: the OT God of an eye for an eye, an ear for an ear and any other
body part available for the barter of rough justice.
The original story is by writer Michael Tolkin who showed his metaphysical
paces in The Player, depicting Hollywood as Purgatory-on-the-Pacific, and in
The Rapture, all about sex, death and the Second Coming. That Tolkin's
initial script for Deep Cover was taken over by a second writer, Henry Bean
(Internal Affairs), may account for the last-reel gaucheries. These include
a Miami Vice-style climax in which the undercover hero (Larry Fishburne) and
his crooked-lawyer pal (Jeff Goldblum) have a crime tryst with a major
political figure in the virtual broad daylight of a well-lit dockside.
Only in a movie. Likewise the late-on hurricane of Washington-linked
conspiracy revelations. But take all this cum grano salis: it does not spoil
the flavour of what goes before as we watch the black police hero's slide
into a blacker moral midnight. Picked for plain-clothes promotion because he
has the coolest answer to his police chief's racist riddle - 'What's the
difference between a black man and a nigger?' - he is soon having to solve
subtler riddles.
Like, what is the difference between a good plain-clothes cop who joins the
crime game and the baddish plain-clothes lawyer (Goldblum) he befriends, who
merely puts a different spin on the blend of foul play with pseudo-probity?
And how much does an undercover mission excuse shutting one's eyes to
plain-sight atrocities? Fishburne must not flinch when cocaine kingpin
Sierra bashes in a crony's face with a pool cue; or when Sierra (again)
humbles Goldblum with an after-dinner torture game; or when a live,
bullet-perforated person is dumped from a speeding car in a midnight tunnel,
with a Parthian gunshot fired at his receding arse.
Good movies take a familiar theme - there are only so many to go round  -
and then spin fast-witted, revelatory variations on it. As directed by Bill
Duke (A Rage in Harlem), Deep Cover is paced and textured like a nightmare.
Everything has an accelerated dark-side logic, as the hero realises his
dwindling control over his own story and fate's flair for fast-forwarding
him towards disaster. Fishburne is good in that rarity - a black leading
role that does not semaphore ethnic significance - and Goldblum is even
better. As the yuppie who keeps being taken to the cleaners along with his
suits, he smiles with terrified elegance at an outpacing world.
In Night And The City another man's world speeds out of control. But this
time we sense the film-makers' hands operating the machinery. Updating the
1950 thriller starring Richard Widmark as a nightclub tout turned fight
promoter, director Irwin Winkler, writer Richard Price (Sea Of Love) and
star Robert De Niro take the story out of London - its original setting,
courtesy of British novelist Gerald Kersh - and set it in New York.
But this is a New York you could order up by telephone. Dial M for mean
streets and you would get this instant, special-delivery, heels-on-wheels
Manhattan. The bar exteriors look manufactured on a back-lot and the people
inside react like a Warner Brothers rent-a-crowd as seedy ambulance-chasing
lawyer De Niro - a little guy with a manic manner - holds forth like a
stand-up comic on his last stand.
And the man's problem? He wants to be a boxing promoter. But he must climb
over human hindrances to do so: like suavely cackling capo Alan King,
jealous bar-owner Cliff Gorman and his De Niro-smitten wife Jessica Lange.
Our hero promises to procure a liquor licence for Miss L so she can quit her
spouse and open her own business. But the promises are mounting up and a man
can keep only so many. Harry Fabian - that is his name - is deep in debt and
deeper in danger.
This all worked 40 years ago with Widmark and director Jules Dassin. But
then everything about the story shouts late 1940s-early-'50s: from the
speak-your-weight dialogue to the fatal-allure sexuality to the post-demob
disquiet (transmuted to film noir) of a generation in job crisis. De Niro,
springy and grinning, acts like a man possessed. But then he is possessed -
by his own art-and-money obligations. For this a De Niro production of a De
Niro project for De Niro's new film company Tribeca. What ever happened to
the days when actors just acted?
Man Bites Dog, a Belgian film about a mass murderer, is the week's third
thriller in which characters put their lives into overdrive and then find
their hands slipping off the steering wheel. The three co-directors - Remy
Belvaux, Andre Bonzel, Benoit Poelvoorde - also co-star. Poelvoorde is the
prattling, preening show-off who likes to kill people. Belvaux and Bonzel
are his dopy cronies, documentary director and cameraman respectively, who
film BP's murders as they happen.
Shot in grainy handheld black-and-white, just like the film whose making it
portrays, Man Bites Dog is shocking less for its full-frontal murders -
though these include stranglings, smotherings and stabbings - than for its
own refusal to be shocked. Killing here has become part of the junk culture
like TV or video games: for couch potatoes read crime potatoes. And however
much he begins by kicking against the violence, the moviegoer is soon
mischievously drawn into the catatonic reflexes: 'Who next?', 'Where?',
'How?'
For this black comedy about brutalisation is also about the voyeur
implications of film-watching. Before an invited audience - ourselves - our
dandyish hero-host demonstrates the techniques and satisfactions of
motiveless killing. Like the torturer-hoodlum in Reservoir Dogs, who wanted
no information from the cop he was maltreating, Man Bites Dog raises the
spectre of cruelty for kicks. We all know it exists; the cinema seldom dares
to confront it head-on; and the British censor almost never lets the result
through when it does. A loud plaudit, then, for the courage and imagination
of current incumbent James Ferman.
The Hungarian Revolution is the subject of Istvan Szabo's Sweet Emma, Dear
Bobe. Not the famed 1956 event, when man bit dogma and dogma bit back; but
the recent pussy-cat revolution when the Soviet empire rolled over and
Eastern Bloc countries tickled its tummy.
The tummy-tickling is now over, says Szabo. Fresh from Meeting Venus, in
which he allegorised the New Europe as an opera troupe that could not get
its act together, the director presents the New Hungary as an atonal chorus
of fury, anguish and disenchantment. Schoolteacher Emma (Johanna Ter Steege)
bleats the futility of teaching Russian to a world going Western. Her buxom
friend Boebe sleeps with many men before finding the fastest way from a high
window to a street. And large dialectical boxing matches - God versus
materialism, love versus sex, art versus barbarism - go on, and on, and on.
It is, we fear, a lecture with dramatic pretensions. As lines of dialogue
clang like a ringside bell - 'Do you think because freedom's here everything
is allowed?', 'Are you the God of emptiness?' (Emma in church) - the
audience bobs and weaves before the pugilistic overemphasis. Nothing
surpasses the simple, oblique dream-magic of the opening shot. A nude girl
slides down a darkling hill of sand clutching at passing plants. We guess,
marvel, are teased and intrigued: things that never happen to us again in
the 80-minute film.
Schtonk] is the small, foolish title of a long, foolish film. Helmut Dietl
wrote and directed this spoof history of the Hitler Diaries scam. But there
was probably more laughter 48 years ago in the Berlin bunker, as Adolf and
Eva swapped shaggy-Alsatian stories while the bombs rained.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: Richard Alston in La Rochelle - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Alston, late of the Rambert Dance Company, is the best choreographer
we Britons have - even though we do not now know where we will find him
next. All around us dance is straining against its nature - towards
heavy-footedness, expressionism, mime routine, or academicism - but Alston
just keeps making real dances. This seems an old-fashioned virtue now, but
it is a true one. And it is the reason why, not long ago, he seemed our
modern dance's brightest pioneer. Noone since Ashton has done more to
establish a British dance style.
Alston is also exceptionally musical. Sometimes he has tried the wrong music
 -scores too ineffable (Mozart) or too weak (Steve Reich) - and this was the
main flaw in his work for the Rambert during his last four years there
(1989-92). But when music inspires him, there is no choreographer alive who
can better illuminate his score. Just as Balanchine's dances taught
thousands of dance-goers (even some music critics) how to hear and love
Stravinsky and Hindemith, so Alston has taught many of us to concentrate
with pleasure on Charles Amirkhanian, Nigel Osborne, Simon Waters, Peter
Maxwell Davies. Music and dance are different elements; Alston is one of
those rare alchemists who can fuse them to create a sum larger than the
parts.
It is our loss than his latest work was made in the much better-subsidised
dance terrain of France. Le Marteau sans maitre, to Pierre Boulez's
eponymous score, has been created in La Rochelle, in rehearsal conditions
that any British troupe should envy, for the Compagnie Chopinot. Boulez's
long score (40 minutes) passes through a wide variety of tempo and sound
(soprano, percussion, wind, strings, in different combinations), and has
stimulated Alston to fashion a rich, constantly shifting, line of dances -
as if Boulez has created a whole gallery and Alston were showing us room
after room. And because this is music through which whole currents of world
music seems to pass (Oriental, African, Schoenberg, Satie, Cage), the dance
seems alert too to wide currents of history and culture.
Everything has texture. Apart from his musical gifts, Alston has an
exceptional flair for showing the body to maximum 3-D effect The effect is
sculptural, but not static; motion is implicit even in the choreography's
stillnesses. The work is structured to emphasise male-female duets and
differences between male and female styles; Alston is not telling stories or
illustrating the enigmatic Rene Char poems that form the music's text, but
he is allowing a large structural tension to evolve poetically. (All of
which illumines the score.) As the piece reaches its conclusion, Chopinot
herself and Georgette Louison Kala-Lobe (her real-life sister) meet - first
with, then without, their partners. The effect is poignant, and the piece
ends on Chopinot alone, moving between shadows and light.
Le Marteau is part of an Alston double bill; the other work is a revival of
his 1977 Rainbow Bandit, originally made on London Contemporary Dance
Theatre, in which Gerard Boucher's lighting emphasises the abstract drama
behind the work.
'Le Marteau sans maitre' is being toured in France by Compagnie Chopinot
until June. Richard Alston is one of the four choreographers featured in
Part Two of 'Striding Out - Aspects of Contemporary and New Dance in
Britain,' by Stephanie Jordan (Dance Books, Pounds 10)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bruce MacPhail (above), whose own impeccable academic pedigree reads
Balliol, Oxford, followed by an MBA at Harvard, is becoming chairman of the
Council of Management of Templeton College, Oxford, succeeding David
Rowland, who is stepping down after seven years. Rowland has just taken over
as chairman of Lloyd's.
P&amp;O's managing director, Sir Bruce has served on Templeton's council since
1986, and the college's new president, Clark Brundin, says he expects him to
continue to produce 'a significant intellectual contribution'.
It doesn't take a man from the top of P&amp;O to realise that Britain is very
much at a disadvantage with regard to its competitors as regards educational
training. But Sir Bruce is sounding optimistic that if Oxford really
embraces management studies - a discipline which in the past it has treated
with some disdain - and turns itself into a 'world-class school', this could
have a very positive impact on domestic industry's perception of the value
of business education.
Templeton is on its way to receiving the Royal Charter as Oxford's 37th
college. At the same time, a separate school of management will be
established, with an MBA programme now targeted (after several
postponements) to commence in October 1995.
While Sir Bruce says he has never for an instant regretted his Harvard
training, he explains that the Oxford version of the MBA will be 'extremely
international in its direction, with a certain amount of on-the-job
experience, and it will involve fluency in another language - all in all a
far cry from the pure case-study stuff I did at Harvard'.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Farmers reap rich
public relations crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON, NANCY DUNNE, WILLIAM DAWKINS and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years, farmers in the big industrialised countries have been
responsible for some of the most successful public relations campaigns ever
launched. In countries such as Japan, the US and France, the result has been
an accumulation of political power and protection as well as economic and
commercial clout on a scale out of all proportion to their relatively small
numbers and the amount of money spent. In this special marketing report, FT
writers look at some of the media and lobbying techniques that have been so
successfully employed.
Japan cultivates a culture
WHEN Japanese farmers last month took to the Tokyo streets in tractors to
show anger at proposed rice market reforms, each of the pre-selected 50
tractors was assigned a number and all were driven in an orderly formation
along a pre-arranged route to ensure that there would be no unscripted
inconvenience to fellow Japanese.
In planning protests such as the tractor drive, the farmers' movement wants
to highlight rice as the essence of Japanese culture and farmers as the
protectors of that tradition. But the strategy generally does not include
the shock tactics employed by European farmers, as such rowdiness is
regarded as a threat to the image of the stoic farmer who braves the
elements to fill the family rice cooker each evening and preserve a
semi-spiritual ritual.
Apart from fostering the folksy image, the defence of the rice market
campaign also includes undermining the reputation of foreign rice. Consumer
groups contribute to the cause, as some of these organisations have links
with Japan Agriculture, the farmers' representative body, and regularly
produce pamphlets warning that foreign farmers use dangerous chemicals in
food production.
A video, 'Imported Rice is Dangerous', was produced last year by the
well-meaning if protectionist Japan Offspring Fund, whose members have links
to farmers' groups. The video traces the tragic lives of weevils in three
containers of rice, one housing the homegrown product, another filled with
Australian rice, and the third containing American rice.
A flourishing family of 50 weevils was added to the US rice and, allegedly
due to the effects of insecticides, 10 of the weevils were dead within four
days. The fate of the weevils in the Australian rice was worse, with all 50
weevils passing away within a week. Naturally, the weevils in the Japanese
rice lived happily ever after.
At the time of the beef liberalisation debate four years ago, a short film
made in praise of Japanese beef depicted a typical family becoming
physically ill after consuming imported meat. After criticism from the US
and Australia, the film was shelved, and Japanese government officials
advised agricultural groups to employ more subtle means in their campaign to
protect markets.
Officially, 6.7 per cent of Japanese earn their living through primary
industry, down from 48.3 per cent in 1950 and 30.2 per cent in 1960, though
the actual number relying solely on agriculture for income is estimated at 3
per cent. Convincing the rest of the population to subsidise these
lifestyles through taxation and by paying six times more than the world
price for rice has generally been made easier because rice is an important
symbol for Japan.
On JA billboards, farmers are pictured in muddy paddy fields or atop small
tractors at harvest time, but the message remains much the same - these
farmers are not merely raising a crop, they are cultivating a culture. To
enhance that image for city slickers, most local farmers' associations
conduct tours of rice growing areas and allow the urban man or woman to meet
rural people.
Most urban Japanese have rural roots, but the links have become more tenuous
with each new generation. In an attempt to interest younger Japanese in the
issue, farmers have embraced the 'environment' theme, arguing that the
countryside would be devastated if the paddy fields were concreted and
warning that flooding could become more common because of the change in the
landscape.
A 'bucket rice' campaign is designed to bring the joys of life on the land
to those who must endure small apartments in Tokyo or Osaka. Farmers
delivered rice seeds, fertiliser and instructions to 200,000 urban dwellers,
who then raised their own small crop in a bucket. A JA official said the
campaign educated children 'who don't know when a rice plant matures' and
allowed city families to eat their own rice, re-establishing their link with
nature.
Fourteen rice producers' organisations have launched a Y700m (Pounds 3.7m)
advertising campaign to make rice more appetising for Japanese youth, as
national consumption has fallen annually by 1.5-2 per cent over the past
decade. The idea of the campaign, one sponsor explained, is to convey a
strong visual impression, so that when a young person is hungry they will
immediately think of rice.
US takes the message to heart
ALTHOUGH weary of high taxes and wary of the budget deficit, Americans this
year will pay out to their farmers subsidies worth about Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 11bn), almost twice as much as in 1992.
Outside Washington DC, where the federal budget cutters are frantic for new
prey, almost no one will complain. Americans are likely to donate Dollars
1m-Dollars 2m to farmers down on their luck through Farm Aid in April, when
country singer Willie Nelson and his friends turn out for their sixth
fundraising concert.
Americans are pre-disposed to revere the farmer, from the time they are
children singing 'Old MacDonald' to their first picture books about Farmer
Bill and his barnyard animals. A large number are still only one or two
generations away from the farm.
A romantic image has emerged of honest, hardworking farm families struggling
against drought, blizzards and big government. For Americans fed up with the
strains of urban life or the commute from the suburbs, the farmer remains a
nostalgic symbol of times when life was simple.
A CBS/New York Times poll, taken in 1986 at the height of the US farm
crisis, found that 55 per cent of Americans would pay higher taxes to help
farmers.
'Americans think farmers deserve special treatment,' the poll concluded. 'A
majority think keeping small farms in operation is so important that the
government should make a special effort to keep small farms in business.
Relatively few blame the farmers themselves for their difficulties.'
These perceptions persist today, and are aided and abetted by sympathetic
journalists and movie makers, who are carefully cultivated by industry
'outreach' programmes. The State Association of Co-operatives, for example,
promotes a Weekend at the Farm scheme for public officials, congressional
aides and journalists.
Besides the Four-H clubs and Future Farmers of America organisations, which
promote farming-related activities in schools, funding from state and
federal level and agribusinesses goes to Agriculture in the Classroom. The
programme educates children in the cities and suburbs about farming.
Communicating for Agriculture, a non-profit organisation with 80,000
members, is a powerful lobby for farmer interests at both state and national
levels. It convinced 27 states to create insurance pools for farmers who
cannot get catastrophic health insurance. It also brings foreign students to
US farms and awards scholarships.
The large agribusiness companies which dominate many sectors of US
agriculture are reluctant to disclose details of their image-enhancing
efforts. But they have been quick to capitalise on the family farmers'
positive image in television advertising.
'Every year the importance of this land increases,' says the Archer Daniels
Midland Company in one of its slick television spots. 'Because every year
there are a lot more mouths to feed - over 95m more. Fortunately, the food
ingredients that ADM makes from an American harvest can help feed people the
world over.'
It is not by coincidence, notes one farm lobbyist, that ADM is receiving
subsidies for ethanol and price supports for the maize used in sweeteners.
'Commercials often promote a vision of agriculture that is beautiful and
colourful,' said Jeff Smedsrud, a Communications for Agriculture official.
'But I'm not at all sure it is that accurate. The public has no clue about
the reality of modern agriculture.'
Carol Brookins, a Washington DC agriculture consultant, says the public
receives a distorted view of farmers. 'There is not the perception that
agriculture is a modern dynamic contributor to the US economy and a creative
and innovative industry.'
When it comes to marketing their products, farmers have shown they are by no
means country bumpkins. The various commodity groups - ranging from beef and
dairy farmers to watermelon producers - organise co-operative advertising
and marketing campaigns. One of the most successful is the National Pork
Producer Council's 'Pork, the Other White Meat'.
It was launched five years ago, when concern over the high fat content of
meat was depressing per capita consumption an average 4.5 per cent a year.
Since then, sales have risen between 0.5 and 1 per cent a year with each 1
per cent gain representing an additional Dollars 200m in sales.
It is compelling evidence that a group of farmers, who were thought to be an
endangered species, can survive and thrive by harnessing modern marketing
methods to an old-fashioned image.
France blends shock with sweet reason
FRENCH farming organisations have a misleading international image of
resorting solely to organised disruption to get their message over to the
public.
Television images of manure-spattered town halls, mounds of burning produce
and spectacular traffic jams caused by tractor road-blocks are perceived by
many to be the stock in trade of France's irascible farmers, in their
demonstrations against the production and price cuts imposed by reforms of
the European Community's common agricultural policy.
Certainly, the temperature has increased as the CAP reforms begin to bite,
yet the French farmers' communications strategy is more complicated and
subtle than that.
Officially, the body responsible for shaping and delivering the agriculture
industry's message to the public is the main union, the Federation Nationale
des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA).
Yet holding a common line is hard for the FNSEA because it is a fragmented
federation, including under its vast umbrella farming unions from France's
96 mainland departments, stretching from the rich cereal growing plains
around Paris to the poor smallholders of the south-west.
'We are always debating within ourselves whether we should appeal to public
opinion or, as many of our farming members would like, put our message over
in a more challenging style,' explains Benedicte Caille, head of external
relations for the FNSEA.
FNSEA's official communications style is moderate, yet in practice it cannot
control some of the more disruptive publicity stunts organised at local
level. One example of the official marketing approach is when the Centre
National des Jeunes Agriculteurs, the young farmers' union, decorated the
Champs Elysees with a field of ripe wheat three years ago.
A charm offensive was the purpose of the largest farming demonstration in
France in recent years, when 200,000 farmers descended on Paris to protest
against the CAP in September 1991. Departmental unions 'twinned' themselves
with Paris arrondissements, making themselves responsible for setting up
stalls with local produce, offering free food and wine tasting.
'The idea was to help Parisians rediscover their roots, to remind them that
we represent an important part of their culture,' explains Caille.
Another part of the FNSEA's charm offensive is a scheme launched two years
ago to invite school children for educational visits to local farms. The
scheme attracted 35,000 visitors in 1990, rising to about 200,000 last year,
says the federation.
In some ways, the FNSEA has to work less hard than other European farm
unions to deliver its message. About a fifth of the French population owes
some of its living directly or indirectly to agriculture and most national
politicians carefully preserve a provincial power base.
On top of this, the FNSEA has the rare privilege of being granted four free
10-minute slots a year on the two state-owned television channels, by the
CSA broadcasting authority. Its latest production was clumsily made, with
the pretty young narrator delivering her message perched on a bicycle which
improbably appeared to be in the middle of a field of corn. Even so, it
drove home the message of the friendly farmer, taking environmental
protection as its theme.
Yet the moderates do not always win the day in FNSEA debates on publicity
strategy. Many farmers were so disappointed with the moderate tone of the
big Paris demonstration in 1991 that they left the FNSEA to form their own
splinter group, called the Co-ordination Rurale.
The new organisation, which has about 10,000 members, represents the sharp
end of farmers' protests and organised a series of successful motorway road
blocks last summer, setting an example for the truck drivers, who used the
same technique to bring most of France to a halt for several days last year.
Another popular tactic by local farmers recently has been to dump truckloads
of mud on the streets outside local government offices. This, says Caille,
is designed to represent land that has been taken out of production under
CAP rules. It is a stark contrast to the days of laying wheat fields on the
Champs Elysees.
UK goes against the grain
BRITISH farmers are not given to concerted mass dumpings of cartloads of
manure outside parliament as a means of persuasion.
Many of them are angry - often with the plethora of marketing and
promotional organisations supposedly backing their causes. But one of their
main lobbying conduits, the 85-year-old National Farmers' Union, encourages
a careful, regular lobbying of key targets in government, media and consumer
groups as the best means of getting a fair hearing.
The UK's 100,000 farmers are a heterogeneous bunch; the 1,000-hectare arable
East Anglian faces quite dissimilar problems from the Welsh hill farmer with
a few hundred sheep. But they share an uncertain future. EC legislation
threatens to cut their incomes. Consumer suspicion over Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy scares in beef, salmonella disease in eggs, growth hormones,
pesticides and battery farming has damaged the social standing of farming.
During the second world war, British farmers were almost revered for feeding
the nation in desperate times. That image has faded even as the economic
desperation of some farmers has increased - 46,000 farmers, wives and their
children left farming during 1991-92, according to government statistics.
Organisations backing farming attempt to counter adverse public opinion. In
1992, the Meat and Livestock Commission spent about Pounds 1.5m on an
advertising campaign aimed at the consumer, under the somewhat
desperate-sounding slogan 'Meat To Live'. The MLC and its steadfast
opponent, the Vegetarian Society, are fighting a propaganda battle in the
country's schools, inundating them with free promotional materials.
As for the NFU, their lobbyists have limited resources compared with some of
their international sister organisations. While it runs a wide variety of
events, newsletters and seminars supportive of farming, it has resisted
generic 'buy British' advertising, both because such campaigns are already
run by separate marketing bodies (such as the MLC and the National Dairy
Council) and because, as Anne Dillon, head of public affairs at the NFU,
puts it, 'there isn't a 'buy British' culture any more'.
Dillon spends considerable time trying to persuade the farming community
that the best public relations - and therefore increased chances of
political success - today means tackling not just Westminster but also the
general public.
Dillon believes that to retain political clout, farmers must start at
stubble level by regaining the confidence of consumers through a combination
of relationship-building with important media and consumer bodies and by
encouraging farmers to be more willing to take on an expanded role,
promoting themselves as defenders of rural Britain and not just food
producers.
When she joined the NFU three years ago, Dillon initiated a three-stage
public affairs strategy, developing links with the women's press - on the
basis that women make most domestic food purchasing decisions - and paying
greater attention to local media.
What is ruled out is throwing bricks at police and starting bonfires in
public highways: 'There is no evidence that setting fire to parking meters
or peeing against trees in front of TV cameras - as has happened on the
Continent - is any more successful than a realistic and sensible negotiation
with the community that you live in or the people who represent you.
'We get much more success with the press by saying: 'You don't believe there
are problems with incomes in farming? Here are three farming families, talk
to them and make up your own mind.' If we said: 'Here are 350 farmers who
are going to set fire to trees in Hyde Park' that would have been put down
as typical farmers' bullying.'
It may be the case that British farmers have little choice but to tread
gently and carefully; they lack the numerical muscle and social esteem of
their counterparts elsewhere.
But they are listened to by government. David Naish, NFU president, has just
been appointed by John Major, the prime minister, to head a special task
force, one of the aims being to see how producers and retailers can meet
each other's requirements with supplies of British food.
But for Dillon, visibility is not commensurate with success: 'When last year
the proposed terms for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were
first on the table they would have removed a great number of family farms in
the UK. By the time we had finished negotiating with the government, and it
in turn had finished negotiating in the EC, it was worth another Pounds
700m. That's not an inconsequential sum of money, without setting fire to
parking meters.'

<TEXT>
It should come as no surprise that Philip Graf (above), is to succeed David
Snedden as managing director and chief executive of Trinity International
Holdings next month. Snedden stays on the board as a non-executive director.
The job is one of the best in the newspaper industry. Trinity, an
independent with headquarters in Chester, publishes 44 UK newspapers and 59
in Canada or the US. Its flagship titles are the Liverpool Daily Post and
its sister evening paper, the Echo.
The careers of the two men have been intertwined for the past 20 years
starting at Thomson Regional Newspapers, where Snedden ran The Scotsman and
the Belfast Telegraph, and Graf was a protege.
Graf, 46, tried to move to Liverpool from his native Northern Ireland in
1978, when he was offered the job of marketing services manager of Trinity's
flagship titles, but a furious Snedden, who was Thomson's joint managing
director, counter-offered with a promotion to the Western Mail in Cardiff.
But when Snedden moved to Trinity in 1982, he had no compunction about
offering Graf a job two years later. Since then Graf has held a succession
of posts, grooming him to succeed Snedden on retirement - at 60, a
requirement of Trinity intended to keep the management fresh.
Graf says that Trinity - cash-rich with only 15 per cent gearing - would
continue to look for more acquisitions and hoped they would be more friendly
than Trinity's aborted, contested bid for Southern Newspapers last year.
Trinity also announced the appointment to its board of Leo Coligan, 44,
managing director of the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo, and Stephen Parker,
40, managing director of the group's weekly papers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Maunders, the Manchester-based housebuilder, has announced that it has
replaced its group managing director - two months after the change was
effected.
Bill Bannister, 43, previously group sales and marketing director, took over
as group md in November, while Bernard Davies, 56, who had been in the post
for a decade, and with the company for 22 years, has left.
Analysts says this was a succession that had been expected, but one that had
been hastened by the need for a tough cost-cutter at the top.
Traditionally, the northern base of the business has been highly profitable;
it is in the south where margins have been under severe pressure in the past
three or four years, and Bannister, managing director of the Southern
division, is understood to have proved his mettle in this area.
John Maunders, the 47-year-old chairman and grandson of the founder, is well
aware of Davies' contribution, according to analysts, and his compensation
package is understood to be in the region of Pounds 200,000.

The TSB Group has headhunted Hans-Detlef Bosel, a board member of Bavarian
bank Bayerische Vereinsbank, to join as its ninth non-executive director and
to provide the group with a 'European view'.
Bosel, who is 43, is currently in charge of retail banking in Germany, with
regional responsibilities for the UK and Austria. He has worked at
Vereinsbank, which is Germany's fourth largest private sector bank, for the
past 12 years, having previously been at Citibank, where he joined as a
trainee in Frankfurt, and later picked up international exposure in London,
New York and Chicago.
TSB says it was looking for an experienced banker who was young, had a solid
international grounding and was particularly familiar with both the UK and
Europe. It adds that the European dimension was important given that the
Continent is much further advanced than is Britain as regards bancassurance,
or the cross-selling of financial services. TSB regards itself as the
pioneer in this field within the UK, an area that has proved a bright spot
for the bank amidst all its other troubles.
Bayerische Vereinsbank has co-operated with Victoria, Germany's fourth
largest insurer, since 1990.

<TEXT>
Companies that race ahead on innovation do not always win in the
market-place. Some fail miserably.
This harsh message was spelled out by John Kay, professor of economics at
the London Business School, at a seminar yesterday in London. 'Firms are
failing to understand that technological innovation has to be used in
conjunction with other factors.'
Kay, also chairman of the London Economics consultancy, said the most
innovative companies were not always those able to make a commercial success
out of their technological achievements. Nor were technological advances
enough to combat competition from low-wage countries.
At the seminar, organised by the Economic and Social Research Council, he
noted that by most criteria, Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company, was the
most successful British company of the past decade. However, 'its success is
based not on the originality of its innovation, which is modest, but on the
effectiveness with which it exploited this. There is a lesson there for all
British companies.'
European companies generally are worse at making a success out of innovation
than those in the Japan and the US, he reckoned. Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, has an impressive technological record but a poor
financial one.
Kay said managing innovation could be costly and uncertain; some innovations
might be technically successful but not profitable. Also, many companies do
not know how to prevent technology 'running away' with their organisation or
how to integrate it effectively (as with financial service concerns).
Kay warned, too, that the rewards of innovation are hard to collect, since
financial returns must be defended from competitors, suppliers, customers
and groups within the company itself. The weakness of innovations is that
they can often be copied easily.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Technology: Mini-discs with a megabyte - James Buxton
monitors an innovation which may give greater flexibility to computer users
on the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The day may not be far off when personal computer users who need to take
large quantities of data on trips will carry a miniature hard disc drive in
their pockets instead of taking several copies of the ubiquitous 3.5-inch
floppy disc.
This would be a boon to business people on the move such as managers and
accountants. They would be able to transfer data such as company accounts
and archive documents from their desktop computers, get on an aircraft and
slot the hard disc drive into another machine at their destination.
The advance would be made possible by the recent invention of extremely
small hard disc drives covering no more surface area than a credit card and
with a thickness of only 10.5cm. A Scottish company, Calluna Technology of
Glenrothes in Fife, has designed the first 1.8-inch drives with 85-megabyte
data storage (the most powerful in this size). It will start assembling the
new drives this spring.
The new drives are initially intended for use in slim sub-notebook-size
computers which current-ly do not have disc drives. From an early stage,
they will be removable.
At present, users of portable machines face a dilemma. They can buy a
computer in the so-called notebook range with both hard disc and floppy
drives. But the machines weigh about 7lb, and may also need battery chargers
or power packs: this is a strong disincentive to carrying them around every
day.
Alternatively they can buy a sub-notebook computer which might weigh about
2lb but with internal memory of no more than 1Mbyte. This can be augmented
by inserting memory cards, a type of semi-conductor which currently offers
between 1Mbyte and 2Mbyte of extra storage. But these will not give the
storage capacity provided by their desktops.
The new miniature hard disc drives will make life easier for busy, mobile
users - though they will still have to negotiate the tiny keyboard. When a
desktop interface for this size of miniature drive becomes available,
possibly later this year, they will load their sub-notebooks with data from
their desktops and obtain a performance that is comparable to that of their
larger machine.
The Calluna team responsible for this breakthrough previously worked for
Rodime, a Glenrothes company which was highly successful in the early 1980s,
producing the world's first 3.5-inch disc drive. But after a series of
setbacks, Rodime put its manufacturing operations into receivership in 1991
and now just licenses its technology.
Norman White, Rodime's former technical director, founded Calluna, of which
he is now managing director, with five ex-Rodime colleagues in late 1991.
The company has assembled a financial package which, including supplier
credits, totals about Pounds 5m, with equity from 3i, Innolion and Altus
Finance (two offshoots of Credit Lyonnais), and Scottish Enterprise (the
official development body for Scotland).
Calluna's achievement was to get two 1.8-inch (48mm) discs within the 10.5mm
thickness specified in the Type III format agreed by the Personal Computer
Memory Card International Association, the US body formed to promote the use
of memory cards. Rival designers have so far only squeezed one drive into
the format, obtaining half the storage capacity of Calluna. The Scottish
company has also made advances in reducing the amount of power needed to run
the drive.
Calluna will assemble its drives in a semi-automated process employing up to
100 people and using sub-assemblies from component makers in the Far East.
It will offer the drives in two versions: one for permanent installation
into the sub-notebook computer by the original equipment manufacturer, and
the other in a portable version.
White says the drives will initially be sold to OEMs, mostly in Taiwan and
Hong Kong, to obtain their validation for the removable version which might
be sold directly by dealers for installation in sub-notebooks.
'Expressions of interest from computer makers in the Far East are especially
strong for our removable version,' says White. 'The OEMs are talking about
the second and third quarters of 1993.' Calluna's target market for the
removable version is likely to be Europe where it will be the only
indigenous manufacturer of 1.8-inch drives.
Calluna will concentrate on the high performance end of a market which could
total 1m units in 1993 and 3m by 1994, and perhaps be worth Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) over five years. Its plant will have the capacity to produce
up to 500,000 a year.
Andrew Baul-Lewis, an analyst with International Data Corporation, says:
'There is potential for that product in the computing market. It depends on
pricing, performance and constantly increasing the capacity of the drive.'
How much will the new drives cost? White says the OEMs might be charged
Dollars 5 per Mbyte of storage making Dollars 400 per drive, compared with
Dollars 30 per Mbyte in memory cards. But the price will fall if the product
takes off.
Success will have its risks. Calluna is embarking on the difficult path of
bringing a product to market and leading in a field where competition is
bound to intensify. Sceptics will point out that these were challenges which
ultimately defeated Rodime.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Technology: Patent troubles create trauma and cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A brown six-inch-thick box landed on the desk of Clive Shipley, joint
managing director of Bath Scientific, a small west country electronics
group, last September. It was to transform what was expected to be a record
year for the small UK company into a four-month trauma that has not yet
ended.
The box, from the International Trade Commission in the US, detailed
allegations by a US competitor, Integri-Test, that it was trading unfairly
in selling its equipment to the US, infringing three patents held by the
competitor which apply to moving probe systems measuring capacitance and
resistance. It called for a temporary exclusion order against Bath
Scientific's products - mainly moving probe systems to test computer circuit
boards.
For Bath Scientific such an exclusion order would spell disaster: 'This
could put us out of business,' Shipley said. While the company, with just 25
staff, claims to be a world leader in a small and highly specialised market
in which it may take up to two years to make each probe, it sold just 20
units last year. Earnings totalled Pounds 1.4m, with half of sales in 1992
made in the US.
The unpleasant twist was that the cost of contesting the case in US courts
might put Bath Scientific out of business just as easily as the loss of the
US market. A one-week hearing by the ITC in Washington last month has cost
the better part of Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 164,000), wiping out all of
expected 1992 profits.
The cruel - and perhaps not accidental - irony is that the action comes at
exactly the point where Bath Scientific's business appears poised for
dramatic growth. The accelerating trend towards miniaturisation in the
electronics industry means manual testing of components is less practicable.
The company saw 40 per cent growth in sales between 1991 and 1992, and
projects annual growth of 50-100 per cent in the three years ahead.
Mercifully for Bath Scientific, the ITC court has ruled initially in its
favour. It found that there were other technologies similar to, and
predating, Integri-Test's patents, and that Bath Scientific was not using
the same technology anyway. Shipley went further last week, dismissing the
patent claims as ludicrous: 'Putting patents on measurement of capacitance
and resistance is like trying to patent gravity, or air.'
But the case is not yet won. Just two days ago Integri-Test called on the
ITC to review and reverse its decision, promising new evidence before the
October deadline for a permanent ruling. It still insists its patents 'are
valid and enforceable'.
The problem facing Bath Scientific is not uncommon for exporters to the US,
and illustrates international concern that US laws intended to protect small
domestic companies against unfair foreign competition by larger foreign
companies are being abused for wider protectionist reasons.
Many US companies have found that the mere act of bringing a case can scare
foreign competitors from the market. Investigations are launched before
careful evaluation of the evidence provided by the US company. Once a case
is launched, legal costs are unavoidable. Faced with the prospect of
expensive legal action, exporters often decide the sensible course is to
lick wounds and withdraw from the market - particularly small companies.
'A normal patent action would take up to six years,' Shipley said. 'We are
confident that we could prove we are right. The problem with this action is
that the US government provides local companies with a powerful lever just
by having the procedure in place.' It is possible that Integri-Test hoped
for exactly this result after arguments for the past six years with Bath
Scientific over patents. The UK company says Integri-Test refused a
'cross-licencing' arrangement, suggesting a main aim was to exclude Bath
Scientific from the US market. Integri-Test counters that Bath Scientific
refused its own proposal for a licencing fee to use the patents.
Integri-Test possibly misjudged how the critical importance of the US to
Bath Scientific gave it no option but to defend the action. Unless the ITC
reverses its December decision, Integri-Test will no longer be able to seek
protection behind patent claims, instead being forced to vie on
technological merit with its UK competitor. But Bath Scientific may have to
wait until October for the threat to be lifted. Meanwhile, legal fees mount.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Man with a mission prepares to take on
the world - Challenges facing the new chairman of the International
Accounting Standards Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EIICHI SHIRATORI, the new chairman of the International Accounting
Standards Committee, is a man with an ambitious mission. By the end of his
term in June 1995, he wants to see his organisation's standards accepted in
most of the world's leading equity markets.
'That is my hope,' he says in a tone which is simultaneously respectful and
assertive. 'It is also my expectation. I am more than 90 per cent certain
that it can be achieved.'
Shiratori, who became chairman at the start of the year, flew back to his
native Japan on Monday after a week in London at headquarters discussing
agendas and addressing some 15 issues to be tackled in the coming months.
He will need all of his skills of persuasion for the task ahead, and may
well be glad that he has retired from his partnership with Arthur Andersen
and can concentrate on his new responsibilities.
After years of toil unnoticed except by a small group of dedicated,
jet-setting accountancy luminaries since its creation in 1973, the
International Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc) has recently begun to
come into its own.
In the late 1980s, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(Iosco) gave Iasc a new lease of life by suggesting in principle that it
might accept international accounting standards as an alternative to
national standards.
Theoretically, that could lead to companies that use its standards being
able to seek a listing on foreign equity markets without the additional
expense and legal difficulties of presentation in that country's format.
Late last year, the process came one step nearer at its annual conference in
London. Iosco agreed to accept the now near-complete canon of international
auditing standards produced by the International Auditing Practices
Committee of the International Federation of Accountants.
Shiratori hopes that Iosco will follow suit by accepting Iasc standards on
the same basis at its next annual meeting this autumn. If not, he is
determined to win acceptance by the time of its 1994 meeting which -
appropriately enough - will be in Tokyo.
Much of the Iasc's efforts up till then will be in completing its so-called
comparability and improvements project. This was designed to reduce the
number of alternative accounting treatments that it permitted in order to
gain approval from its members.
The most immediate question is what compromises Iasc may be forced to make
in order to gain Iosco's approval. More fundamental is whether the magic
endorsement will hold sufficient reward in comparison to the energy being
invested in the process.
To its critics, the International Accounting Standards Committee still seems
irrelevant. While a small group of technical accountants works away busily
in the background, few others - least of all the national equity markets -
pay much heed.
There may be a case that the drafters are moving far too much ahead of the
demand for international standards. Certainly it has so far proved
impossible for the committee to fill its three vacant, part-time board seats
with any representatives from business.
Equally, the number of companies using Iasc standards appears to be small.
The organisation's latest survey last summer showed just 94 companies had
cited the standards in their published financial statements - although these
included some notable names such as Nestle and Fujitsu.
But Mr Ray Hinton, technical partner with Arthur Andersen, dismisses the
figures: 'There is by no means a flood, but the most important thing is not
whether companies say they are complying but whether they are.
'Even more important is whether international accounting standards are
permeating into the standards of individual countries,' he says. 'National
standards-setters won't necessarily confess to it, but the Iasc has an
influence by osmosis. They are loath to go in the other direction.'
He cites the example of related-party transactions, issued by the Iasc in
1984 and now finding a place in many countries' standards. In the UK, he
argues that the Accounting Standard Board's statement of principles has
drawn heavily on the Iasc's conceptual framework.
Some countries have adopted the Iasc standards virtually unchanged, such as
Singapore, Malaysia and a number in Africa. Several Stock Exchanges,
including London and Hong Kong, already accept international standards as
alternatives to their own national ones for listing.
Now one of the key missing players has also begun to thaw. The US,
previously hostile to the Iasc, has started to take notice, driven in part
by concern over companies seeking listings in other countries rather than
meeting its own tough requirements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has begun to conduct more open
dialogue. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission has become more
active. Late last year, Mr Walter Scheutze, its chief accountant, began
talking about the need for an 'accounting Esperanto' to broach the
differences in accounts in countries across the world.
But these gestures have come at a high price. The International Accounting
Standards Committee, already very much driven by Anglo-Saxon accounting
principles, has been forced to bend even more towards the US approach
apparently in order to gain acceptance.
One clear instance which caused the stomachs of many observers to sink was
Iasc's decision to permit last-in-first-out (Lifo) for the valuation of
inventories in its revised standard IAS 2. Among the key proponents was the
US.
Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with Ernst &amp; Young, argues that
there is an irreconcilable tension between Iasc's role in setting minimum
standards for national adoption and standards allowing multi-nationals to
seek foreign listings.
He also questions how meaningful harmonisation of accounting standards can
ever be whilst national practices are a function of very different cultural
and political regimes, with widely divergent tax systems and other factors
which make cross-border comparisons fraught with ambiguity.
Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that even if Iosco does accept
international accounting standards, it can persuade its member countries'
regulators and exchanges to accept them. It will prove a difficult battle in
the US. It will be tougher still in Germany and in Mr Shiratori's own
country, Japan.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour leadership assured of
non-compliance with Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S pro-Maastricht faction yesterday won assurances from the leadership
that nothing would be done during the debate on ratification that could be
interpreted as helping the Tory Euro-sceptics, Ivo Dawnay writes.
The pledge came from Mr Jack Cunningham at the weekly meeting of the
parliamentary Labour party where those seeking outright opposition to all
closure motions cutting short debate on amendments to the treaty clashed
with others committed to qualified support.
In an attempt to calm the debate on tactics, the shadow foreign secretary
said Labour's business managers intended to continue to keep their cards
close to their chests.
The main goal was to stress Labour's objections to aspects of the bill,
primarily the lack of UK adherence to the social chapter on workplace
rights. But Mr Cunningham assured the pro-Europeans that Labour was not in
the business of 'wrecking' the bill.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Women's skills highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS must not ignore the skills of women as Britain comes out of
recession, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday.
Launching a national campaign to raise women's awareness of opportunities
for work, training and voluntary service, she said it aimed to extend and
broaden Opportunity 2000, the private-sector initiative designed to get more
women into industry.
The campaign's centrepiece, an exhibition called New Horizons for Women,
opened in Manchester and will tour the country for the rest of this year, as
well as being staged at the Royal Agricultural Show.
Mrs Shephard conceded unemployment would lag economic recovery but said:
'Now is the time to remind employers to exploit the skills of everyone in
the economy.'
The labour market had changed with new technology so there was also a need
to remind individual women of their capacity to become more entrepreneurial.
She wanted enhancement of their individual skills.
The exhibition indicates that only 8 per cent of 144,000 managers in large
companies are women, three times as many men as women hold public
appointments, 46 per cent of university students are women but 97 per cent
of professors and top lecturers are men, and one in 10 of 1.69m construction
workers are women.
Mrs Shephard said the government's decision to abolish wages councils, which
set minimum pay for 2.5m people, would not affect particularly women in the
hotel and food industries, as critics claimed.
Two thirds of people covered by the councils already earned above
recommended minimums, she added.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont 'affected' by tabloid
stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR government officials told MPs yesterday that Mr Norman Lamont's
ability to perform his official duties as chancellor had been affected by
press stories in April 1991 over a self-styled 'sex therapist' who had
rented part of his London house.
Sir Peter Middleton, the former permanent secretary of the Treasury, told
the cross-party public accounts committee: 'It undoubtedly affected his
official business and his ability to perform his official duties. It took up
time and affected his reputation.'
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, told committee members the issue
had affected the credibility of the chancellor's position and the attention
he could give to his duties if no action were taken.
The committee is examining a Pounds 4,700 payment by the Treasury covering
legal expenses incurred by Mr Lamont in evicting the woman.
Sir Robin and Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury permanent secretary, agreed to
review the guidelines on meeting ministerial expenses, though they defended
the Treasury contribution to Mr Lamont's costs.
The two told the committee that the payment was so definitely within the
existing guidelines that it was not thought necessary to highlight it in the
departmental accounts. This was not affected by the differences among senior
officials about how much of the Pounds 22,000 total bill should be met.
Their justification to the committee, which monitors government spending,
was that there was a public interest because the story was affecting Mr
Lamont's work.
The officials said the need to deal urgently with the matter was underlined
by the presence in London of finance ministers from abroad that weekend for
a G7 meeting.
Sir Terry acknowledged that in the light of experience it would be sensible
to revise the guidelines, but cautioned against the idea that guidance could
be devised to meet every set of circumstances: however detailed, it would
still be a matter for officials' judgment.
Sir Robin said the growing number of cases arising from ministers' personal
lives affecting their official duties meant it made sense to consolidate the
guidance 'dotted about here and there' on questions such as press officers'
involvement with personal ministerial matters.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warned on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT warned Labour last night that the UK would be unable to
ratify Maastricht if the party succeeded in its attempt to amend legislation
on the treaty with the aim of reinserting the social chapter for Britain.
As Labour mounted its first significant offensive against the government
during the treaty's Commons committee stage, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign
office minister, said that approval for the amendment would mean MPs
approving legislation different to that agreed at Maastricht.
'Therefore it would not be possible for the UK to ratify the treaty,' the
minister said.
But Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said he knew the party
would create a dilemma for the government.
'The problem has a simple solution - to include the social chapter in the
Maastricht treaty,' he said. A vote on the amendment is not due for a few
weeks.
Mr Cunningham added that the other 11 European Community countries had told
Labour they would be 'happy' to see Britain abandon the protocol which
allows it to opt out of the social chapter.
Challenged by a Tory MP about whether it would mean the other countries
re-ratifying the treaty, Mr Cunningham said they 'have already accepted the
social chapter'.
If passed, Labour's amendment would remove Britain's opt-out, but would need
fresh negotiations with other EC countries and a further amendment in order
to actually incorporate the social chapter.
Labour regards reinserting the chapter as its principal objective during the
Commons stages of the bill. Mr Cunningham said Britain's opt-out went
against 'what was clearly understood by everyone else' - the importance of
investing in a trained workforce.
The party's chances of winning approval for its amendment depend on how the
Tory opponents of Maastricht decide to vote. Some may back Labour to try to
wreck the bill - even though they oppose the social chapter.
Liberal Democrats support the social dimension of Maastricht but would not
want to risk wrecking the bill. No side is disclosing tactics.
Mr Garel-Jones went out of his way to warn the government's Tory opponents
about taking any steps that would risk Britain's opt-outs. He said the
government had won the general election last April on a manifesto setting
out its opposition to the social chapter.

THE Brewers' Society yesterday called for a reduction in excise duty on beer
to counter rising duty-paid imports from continental Europe.
With the UK tax on beer seven times greater than in France, duty-paid
imports were 'flooding' in, a team led by Mr Ian Prosser, Bass chairman and

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership yesterday sought to defuse controversy over its
attitude to the monarchy by disassociating itself from calls from senior
figures within the party for a fundamental review of the constitutional role
of the Queen, Ralph Atkins writes.
The shadow cabinet agreed that policies for constitutional reform would not
cover the royal family. But Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister,
used a newspaper article yesterday again to urge a public debate about the
monarchy.
'While affection for the Queen remains undiminished, support for the
institution she heads is palpably declining,' he wrote.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fair play urged for lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons national heritage committee yesterday appealed to the government
to ensure that football pools and the new national lottery would operate 'on
a level playing field'.
The committee rejected the arguments of Mr Peter Brooke, the national
heritage secretary, that football pools were a game of skill rather than
effectively a lottery and therefore not entitled to similar treatment.
The committee recommended that the lottery and the pools be treated equally
in the way they are marketed. Pools, for example, should gain the right to
advertise on television, to market their products in the same way as the
lottery and to roll up jackpots from one week to the next. At the moment all
prize money has to be distributed in the week it is received.
The committee, chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester
Gorton, said 90 per cent of pools players used the same numbers every week
so that the pools were in effect a lottery rather than a game of skill. The
committee felt that 'the similarities between the pools and the national
lottery are substantial; it is essential that the two should operate on a
level playing field.'
The committee said the Office of the National Lottery should be sited in the
Liverpool area because that was where job losses in the pools industry would
hit hardest.
The second reading of the National Lottery Bill is scheduled for Monday.
The shadow cabinet agreed last night to table an amendment to the lottery
bill insisting that jobs in the pools industry are safeguarded.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories at odds over media standards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTACK on successive Tory governments for allowing even lower standards
by 'the worst newspapers in the world', while 'vandalising' the best in
television, was launched yesterday by Lord Gilmour, a former Tory cabinet
minister.
He criticised ministers for not introducing a Freedom of Information Act and
for not protecting television. Lord Gilmour, formerly Sir Ian Gilmour, also
said the government should change its mind and back statutory curbs as set
out in the Calcutt report.
Meanwhile, Mr Kenneth Baker, another former Tory cabinet minister, used a
speech to a Commons press gallery lunch to say that statutory control of the
press would be 'absurd'. Though some 'adjustment' to laws was needed, that
would still leave a wide area where press coverage would depend on a code of
behaviour, he said.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Training body 'in low gear'
</HEADLINE>

INVESTORS IN PEOPLE, the government's main tool for improving the training
of people in work, is 'still in low gear', Training and Enterprise Councils
told a Commons select committee yesterday.
Representatives of Tecs, which administer publicly funded training
programmes in England and Wales, along with a range of other initiatives
including IIP, were giving evidence to the select committee on employment.
Written evidence drawn from the 82 Tecs, presented to the committee, said
that IIP was a key tool in aiding business performance. But it said: 'There
is some concern over the national profile and backing and the resource
dedicated to the initiative is small. It is still in low gear.'
Tecs until this year had no special funds for the initiative which seeks to
assess the quality of training within companies.
Tecs also said in the written evidence that for most companies the national
education and training targets - set by the Confederation of British
Industry and endorsed by government - were a 'remote and unrecognised part
of some national agenda'. The targets - which set dates for the acquisition
of the new national vocational qualifications  - needed a much higher
national profile, the Tecs said.
Mr Ken Eastham, Labour MP for Blackley, asked Tec representatives whether
they were concerned over providers of training, in particular cash-strapped
local authorities, withdrawing from providing places for individuals on
Youth Training.
Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of G10, which represents Tecs to government,
said: 'It is a worrying situation.'
In the written evidence, Tecs expressed concern over reduced unit prices for
Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for the adult long-term
unemployed. It said: 'The concern is that both both YT and ET are headed for
a low skill, low quality, low expectation, low take-up and low prestige aid
of last resort position.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind is cautious on military
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, yesterday said that the UK should
not commit military forces to international peace enforcement operations
where there was no military solution but merely public clamour for
'something to be done.'
Referring to demands for greater international military involvement in the
Bosnian conflict, Mr Rifkind said: 'It is our servicemen who have to bear
the risk, not those who call for their deployment.'
His speech to the Royal United Services Institute was highlighted by Downing
Street as a clear statement of the government's thinking at a time when
anxiety has risen markedly at Westminster over the extent of Britain's
military commitments overseas.
At the same time, however, senior officials confirmed that Britain expected
to be asked to contribute to a 3,500-strong United Nations force for the
Kuwait-Iraq border and anticipated a formal request from the Kuwaitis to
provide defence forces.
While it was hinted that the request from Kuwait would be considered
sympathetically, there remain reservations over whether Britain should also
supply personnel to the UN Gulf peacekeeping force.
Mr Rifkind spelt out his criteria behind the deployment of the armed forces.
'We should not put them into danger unless we are satisfied that there is a
real military task for them to do, a realistic prospect of their achieving
it and a degree of risk to their physical safety which is not unacceptably
high,' he said.
Governments had to be careful about assuming that military action was, in
all cases, the answer to serious international crises. From time to time the
UK would have to stand out publicly against the use of force and decline to
contribute to international military operations because they entailed
'open-ended commitments' or were not in the national interest.
The UK had consistently refused to commit ground forces in Bosnia 'in an
intervention role', as distinct from a humanitarian role, for such reasons,
the defence secretary said.
But he stressed that any attempts to fly combat planes by the warring
factions would be viewed with 'the same seriousness' as in Iraq. It was
'highly desirable' the no-fly zone over Bosnia should be enforced, he said.
Because of the limited availability of forces, Britain should press for
'explicit time limits' to be placed on peacekeeping operations. Failing
that, limits should be set on the period for which any one country should
commit forces to the UN for a particular operation.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge same deal for pools as
lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE national heritage select committee yesterday appealed to the government
to ensure that football pools and the new national lottery would operate 'on
a level playing field'.
The committee rejected the arguments of Mr Peter Brooke, the national
heritage secretary, that football pools were a game of skill rather than
effectively a lottery and therefore not entitled to similar treatment.
The committee recommended that the lottery, which will have a top prize of
more than Pounds 1m a week, and the pools be treated equally in the way they
are marketed and sold.
The pools, for example, should gain the right to advertise on television, to
market their products in the same way as the lottery and to roll up jackpots
from one week to the next - at the moment all prize money has to be
distributed in the week it is received.
The committee, chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester
Gorton, said 90 per cent of pools players used the same numbers every week,
so that the pools were in effect a lottery rather than a game of skill.
'In the committee's view the similarities between the pools and the national
lottery are substantial. It is essential that the two should operate on a
level playing field.'
Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons pools, welcomed the report.
He said he hoped the government would take note of what both supporters and
opponents were saying.
The committee recommended that the headquarters of the Office of the
National Lottery be located in the Liverpool area because that was where job
losses in the pools industry would hit hardest.
The MPs said it was 'imperative' that the money allocated from the lottery
to the arts, heritage, sport, charities, and the millenium fund for projects
marking the year 2000, should not be regarded as substitutes for public
funding.
It said it would also like the National Heritage Department to monitor the
possible impact of the lottery on charities to make sure they did not lose
out overall.
The second reading of the National Lottery Bill is scheduled for Monday.
Mr Brooke said when he published the bill that about Pounds 1.5bn tickets
could be bought each year, generating Pounds 14m of prizes each week and
about Pounds 350m a year for good causes.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: No longer a dirty word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is searching for an industrial strategy. It is a serious
project. More than any other, it may ultimately define the extent to which
Mr John Major's government breaks with the 1980s.
The shift began with the package of tax incentives and export assistance for
industry in the 1992 Autumn Statement. In part it was dictated by
circumstance. Driven from the European exchange rate mechanism, the
government needed something with a strategic ring to it.
But Mr Major has not lost interest. Quite the reverse. The March 16 Budget
will see the Treasury obliged to bury the rest of a Lawsonian theology which
treated widget manufacturers no differently from fast-food outlets. The
prime minister was never convinced by sophisticated arguments that the trade
deficit would in the end look after itself.
The message from 10 Downing Street is that manufacturing counts: that the
prime minister sees no reason why British companies cannot compete again in
industrial sectors which they all but abandoned during the the 1970 and
1980s. He is interested in exports, he wants ministers to bat for Britain.
The renaissance of the car industry is offered as a model.
Mr Major is leading by example. Last week he spent a morning talking to the
managers of the country's leading food producers, processors, retailers and
caterers. He wanted to know what the government could do to help them
compete effectively in domestic and overseas markets. At the front of his
mind was a Pounds 5bn trade deficit in food products.
On Saturday a further 20 captains of industry will accompany him on his
official aircraft on a 5-day trip to India, the first of many prime
ministerial trade missions.
Early in February cabinet ministers will be summoned to 10 Downing Street to
explain how they intend to contribute to a renewed drive to lift the
regulatory burden on business. Mr Major believes that the damaging impact on
industrial competitiveness of excessive regulation is greatly
under-estimated. Part of it is blamed on Brussels; much more on excessive
zeal in Whitehall.
The pro-industry message is being picked up across the government. Sir
Terence Burns, the astute permanent secretary to the Treasury, has already
instructed his senior officials to start meeting businessmen. (One mandarin
confessed this week that it had never occurred to him to visit a factory.
What were they like?). Budget submissions from manufacturing industry are no
longer filed in Treasury wastebins.
So far so good. It is hardly surprising that a government stunned by the ERM
debacle and an economy emerging uncertainty from such a prolonged recession
goes out of its way to underpin business confidence. But more than the
rhetoric is changing.
The coal industry debacle and a squeeze in his department's budget have
obscured the influence of Mr Michael Heseltine. His department may not have
any extra money but its political clout has increased as that of the
Treasury has declined. The trade and industry secretary is as concerned
about securing institutional and cultural changes in Whitehall as about
securing extra cash.
Mr Heseltine's starting point is that the realities of international trade
and industrial co-operation mean the government cannot avoid a role in
shaping the future of strategic industries. Mr Major seems to agree with
him.
Purists on the right of the Tory party are horrified. Many cling to the
1980s orthodoxy that the government should do no more than set the
macro-economic framework. Markets can then decide whether manufacturing
industry sinks or swims.
Already there are dark mutterings about a return to Heathite corporatism.
They will grow louder when Mr Heseltine unveils plans to subsidise some of
the 31 coal mines threatened with closure. In reality the pit handouts will
have more to do with the politics of a Tory majority of only 21 than with
any fundamental change of heart.
The government is not seeking a return to the 1970s. Businessmen may find
themselves chatting to the prime minister across the cabinet table, but
there will be no places for the unions.
Mr Major is not talking about subsidies for sunset industries. He sees the
future in technological innovation, in turn driving a determination to
increase opportunities in - and the status of - technical and vocational
education.
And the prime minister does believe a Thatcherite commitment to free markets
can be melded with a strategy which gives the government a supporting, and
occasionally a leading, role in shaping Britain's industrial future.
We will have to wait for the Budget and beyond to see exactly what that
means in practice. But it is important enough that interventionism is now
seen as a misunderstood rather than a dirty word.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition assurance on Maastricht
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S pro-Maastricht faction yesterday won assurances from the leadership
that nothing would be done during the debate on ratification that could be
interpreted as helping the Tory Euro-sceptics.
The pledge came from Mr Jack Cunningham at the weekly meeting of the
parliamentary Labour party where those seeking outright opposition to all
closure motions cutting short debate on amendments to the treaty clashed
with others committed to qualified support.
In an attempt to calm the debate on tactics, the shadow foreign secretary
said Labour's business managers intended to continue to keep their cards
close to their chests.
The main goal was to stress Labour's objections to aspects of the bill,
primarily the lack of UK adherence to the social chapter on workplace
rights. The government believes the chapter, which lays down maximum working
hours and minimum working conditions, would constrain business and harm the
economy.
But Mr Cunningham also assured the pro-Europeans that Labour was not in the
business of 'wrecking' the bill.
During a 20 minute discussion, Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader,
made clear that he would not oppose a guillotine, or restricted timetable,
for debate on the bill if the government moved one.
Mr Giles Radice, the pro-Maastricht MP for Durham North, also expressed
disquiet that Labour's message might be misinterpreted as being opposed to
the broad thrust of the treaty.
For the dogmatic oppositionists, Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) argued
forcefully for the maximum of disruption. 'It's a hostage to fortune if an
opposition helps the government to gag people from continuing to speak,' he
said.
A closure motion would help the government get on to the 'more evil' aspects
of its legislative programme such as coal and rail privatisation, he argued.
On tactical timing, a spokesman said that if the government 'ran away' from
the closure motion it would be showing it did not have the courage to debate
the policy in prime time.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Rate of pay increases criticised as too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE competitive gains of devaluation will quickly disappear if the UK does
not deal with its 'long-standing pay problem', says a pamphlet published
today, Emma Tucker writes.
Mr Fred Bayliss, chairman of the independent Employment Policy Institute,
argues that employers are still awarding pay increases higher than the rate
of inflation in spite of rising joblessness.
This trend persisted throughout the 1980s and into this decade when it was
the received wisdom that pay was best left to the unimpeded judgment of
individual private employers, the pamphlet says. For this reason, the UK
needs to adopt a co-ordinated approach to pay settlements.
According to the pamphlet, the rate of earnings increases in the UK is too
high even during a recession. Earnings growth needs to fall below inflation
if the real economy is to derive maximum advantage from the devaluation of
the pound.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Business rates may rise by 20 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS rates may rise by 20 per cent in April and such an increase could
be the last straw for thousands of small businesses, ministers will be
warned today, Richard Evans writes.
The Federation of Small Businesses says that, unlike the new council tax,
which for some people will be softened by rebates, the uniform business rate
will have no cushioning factor. Federation members assume the government
will still refuse to extend the suspension of the transitional increases in
business rate introduced in last year's Budget.
Mr John Harris, federation chairman, said: 'Businesses were given a lifebelt
by the chancellor last year with caps on the increases in their rate bills.
The recession is still biting hard and businesses are not out of the danger
zone. It is imperative that the government continues to provide help for
hard-hit business rate payers in the same way as it will be doing for
householders.'
The federation repeats its call for councils to be sympathetic to small
businesses.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Minister tells SIB to 'inject fear'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY Nelson, econ-omic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday advised
the Securities and Investments Board, to 'conduct their activities in a way
to inject a little more fear into the system'.
Mr Nelson, the minister responsible for overseeing financial services
regulation, also said SIB should take over the duties of self-regulatory
organisations in the financial services industry which do not supervise
their members adequately.
He made his remarks under questioning by members of the Commons Treasury and
Civil Service committee.
'The SROs are responsible for authorising, supervising and fining their
members,' he said. 'When the SIB feels an SRO is unable to do that it must
take those duties on itself.'
Mr Nelson added that SIB had to take a more aggressive approach with the
self-regulatory bodies.
The threat that SIB would directly assume regulation of retail financial
services was implied recently in a letter sent by its chairman Mr Andrew
Large to members of a committee drafting rules for the proposed
self-regulatory organisation to be known as the Personal Investment
Authority.
Mr Large said that if the planned organisation failed to improve investor
protection and raise standards for members it would not be allowed to
operate.
Mr Nelson, questioned by MPs about the letter, declined to be drawn on
whether he supported its message. He said, however: 'The SIB is right and
entitled to seek to define for the guidance of the board the minimum
principles of compliance that they would like to see . . . The PIA cannot
just be what it wants to be.'
Mr Nelson has ordered Mr Large to conduct a review of the way
self-regulatory organisations are supervised and to make recommendations
designed to improve investor protection.
He told MPs he believed it would not be necessary to rewrite the Financial
Services Act to achieve better investor protection. Standards could be
raised if SIB simply exercised all of its existing powers.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Shopkeepers' euphoria goes out of the window: Why the
Christmas retail figures came as a surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE euphoria that surrounded retailers at new year, amid reports of the
busiest start to January sales for years, evaporated abruptly this week.
On Tuesday the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades
survey showed that many retailers had a disappointing Christmas, with sales
reported to have fallen on a year-on-year basis for three successive months.
In December, the balance between retailers reporting an increase in sales
and those reporting a decrease was minus 4, compared with plus 5 the year
before.
Yesterday, government figures from the Central Statistical Office showed
that high street spending in December fell 0.7 per cent - in contrast to the
0.5 per cent rise many analysts had expected.
Retailers are notoriously wary about revealing details of their Christmas
and new year performance. But the generally upbeat tone of those who have
commented - and widespread reports of a last-minute spending surge before
Christmas and a promising start to the January sales - mean the official
figures have come as a blow to the government and to the sector.
Among the stores, Marks and Spencer said its full-price sales figures were
higher than the year before although the increase was not in double figures.
Sales were particularly strong in the three weeks to January 2, and the
company had been left with considerably less stock to be marked down for the
post-Christmas sales than in the previous year.
Mr Stuart Hampson, who takes over next month as chairman of the John Lewis
Partnership, said yesterday that Christmas spending had come late, but had
eventually been slightly above expectations. The encouraging start to
January had continued, with noticeable growth in the household goods sector.
The Storehouse group, which includes BhS and Mothercare, was similarly
positive, saying it had experienced sales growth consistent with the trend
of year-on-year increases - averaging about 8 per cent - which it has shown
in the past 15 months.
Elsewhere the news was more patchy. Ratners, the jewellery chain, said sales
were down 27 per cent in December although operating profits were up 20 per
cent, reflecting a switch away from the strategy of heavy price-cutting the
previous year and towards increasing margins.
Body Shop surprised the City with the news that like-for-like sales, which
do not include new shops or store closures, were down 8 per cent in the nine
weeks to December 26. However, like-for-like sales for the three weeks to
January 2 were up 4 per cent, reflecting the late Christmas surge.
Big food retailers are generally thought to have had a good Christmas. Tesco
announced like-for-like sales growth of 1.5 per cent and total sales growth,
including new stores, of 9.5 per cent for the four weeks to January 2,
prompting some analysts to increase their profit forecasts.
J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, is said to have seen
like-for-like growth of between 4 and 5 per cent over the same period;
Argyll, owner of Safeway, 3 per cent; and Wm Morrison 6.5 per cent.
What conclusions can be drawn? The discrepancy between the statements of the
bigger retailers and the government's figures seems to reflect a factor
noted in the CBI survey - that big retailers performed well while small
retailers, employing fewer than 200 people, did badly.
Moreover, there is little doubt that retailers did enjoy a few very good
days - notably in the week before Christmas and the first few days of the
sales. But while these grabbed the headlines, they could not fully
compensate for an otherwise flat Christmas period.
Many industry observers pointed out that the overall pattern of spending was
similar to that in 1987, the last time Christmas fell on a Friday.
'Economically, you couldn't find two more diverse years, but the pattern of
trading was very similar,' said Marks and Spencer.
The pattern of spending may be evidence of something else. Many retailers
share the view of Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, who believes UK
consumers are increasingly sophisticated and more apt to postpone their
shopping until they can get the best prices.
Most retailers agree there is little sign of a consumer-led upturn, and
little prospect of one until the housing and employment markets recover.
'People do have more money in their pockets, but the feeling is, I'm OK now
but I might not be in a few months,' commented one retail executive.
Many retailers also warn they can no longer absorb the rising costs of
imports since sterling's devaluation in September and these are bound to
start being reflected in retail prices. This, in turn, could delay any
return in consumer confidence.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commercial lease provisions criticised by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday criticised the structure of commercial
property leases as being inconsistent with the government's anti-inflation
policies.
Clauses that provide only for increases in rents 'seem designed for a world
which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values,' it
said.
'This pattern is not in the interest of the economy as a whole and the
thrust of our anti-inflationary policy is intended to make it obsolete.'
The comments were made in a speech prepared by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the
Bank's governor, for a conference organised by the British Property
Federation. The speech was delivered by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director,
because Mr Leigh-Pemberton was ill.
The Bank also criticised 'privity of contract', whereby tenants who assign
their leases may be obliged to pay rent if a subsequent tenant defaults, as
having 'apparently absurd outcomes'.
The possibility of a change to 'privity of contract', which was included in
the last Conservative manifesto, is being examined by Lord Mackay, the Lord
Chancellor.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's speech warned that the attraction of property as an
investment could be further diminished. 'If, as I suspect, we are to see
further erosion of the institutional lease sector as the balance of power
moves back in favour of the tenant, we could see the gap between property
and gilt yields widen still further.'
However, he said the liquidity in the commercial property market would
improve as demand responded to lower prices and a wider economic recovery.
'Bleakness will not endure,' he said. 'But we must not allow inflation to be
the route by which values are restored.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / Jaguar seeks 25% rise in worldwide sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the luxury carmaker, aims to increase sales worldwide by more than
25 per cent this year to about 28,300, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief
executive, said yesterday.
The company, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is trying to halt the decline
it has suffered in the past four years. During that time its sales have more
than halved and it has fallen into heavy losses.
Mr Scheele said Jaguar was aiming to launch its planned new range of smaller
sporty saloons - intended to compete with the models such as the BMW 5
series - by 1998.
Jaguar said its retail sales worldwide fell last year by 12.4 per cent to
22,478 - the lowest level since 1982. The fall was from 25,661 in 1991 and
from a peak of 49,494 in 1988. Production fell last year by 10.5 per cent to
20,593 - the lowest level since 1981 - from 23,0918 in 1991 and a peak of
51,939 in 1988.
Mr Scheele said the company's financial performance had improved last year
from the record pre-tax loss of Pounds 226m in 1991, but he refused to
disclose detailed figures.
The Jaguar UK workforce, which has been reduced by 44 per cent in the past
two years, fell to 6,759 at the end of last year from 7,928 a year earlier
and from 12,050 at the end of 1990.
The company forecast yesterday that the main impetus for its sales recovery
would come from the US, where it is seeking to increase sales by more than
40 per cent this year to 12,500 from 8,681 last year.
Its US sales, which fell by 7.4 per cent last year from 9,376 in 1991, have
fallen by nearly two thirds in the past six years from a peak of 24,464 in
1986.
Mr Scheele said that the company also planned to increase significantly its
marketing effort in Germany and Japan, where sales dropped heavily last
year.
Jaguar also aims to enter a series of new markets to boost its worldwide
sales - it plans to start sales in China for the first time.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Bank union seeks action on raids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are seven raids on high-street banks and building societies every day,
Bifu, the banking union claimed yesterday.
Bifu called for urgent action to improve security, train staff and provide
better support for those affected by raids.
It also called on the government to toughen laws on carrying, advertising
and distributing replica weapons which are used in many raids and are often
indistinguishable from real weapons.
The details emerged at the launch of a series of draft guidelines on bank
raids developed by the Health &amp; Safety Executive in conjunction with Bifu,
employers, police, government officials and the Victim Support Group.
The guidelines, out for consultation for three months, call for better
training, improved counselling for those affected by raids and additional
co-ordination with the police.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Cigarette advert curb backed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to ban cigarette advertising intensified
yesterday when the cross-party Commons health committee supported the move.
The committee urged the government to support proposals to restrict tobacco
advertising to points of sale when they are considered by EC health
ministers later this year. It said that if Britain dropped its opposition,
it would require the support of only one more country for a directive
banning advertising to be adopted.
'The government cannot continue to procrastinate on the issue of an
advertising ban on the grounds that it is awaiting a level of proof about
its effectiveness which is in the nature of things unobtainable,' said the
committee.
Yesterday's report was widely welcomed by organisations campaigning for a
ban. The British Medical Association said the committee's acceptance of
evidence that tobacco advertising increased tobacco consumption - a disputed
issue - was a 'victory for common sense'.
But the Tobacco Advisory Council, the industry's trade association, said the
report leant 'too heavily on data which are seriously flawed, muddled and
unsubstantiated'.
Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, is to introduce a private member's bill
next week calling for a ban.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Fimbra payouts increase tenfold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT financial advisers were forced to pay clients more than Pounds
1.2m as compensation for 'mis-selling' in 1992, a tenfold rise on the
previous year, Norma Cohen writes.
According to figures released yesterday by Fimbra, the self-regulatory body
which oversees the industry, most of the claims amounting to Pounds 731,000
stemmed from purchases of so-called home income plans.
These were contracts under which clients were encouraged to mortgage their
homes and purchase an annuity.
In 1991 investors won claims of Pounds 110,632 against Fimbra members of
which Pounds 72,000 was related to home-income plans.
The figures were published as part of Fimbra's first report of performance
indicators, which it now intends to publish quarterly.
The data also show a sharp rise in consumer complaints against Fimbra
members and an equally sharp rise in Fimbra's supervisory visits and
punitive actions against members.
Complaints rose to 3,212 last year from 2,651 in 1991 while compliance
visits last year rose to 3,294 from 2,564 in 1991.
Fimbra suspended 254 members last year and collected more than Pounds
339,000 in fines and costs. The year before it suspended 127 members and
collected more than Pounds 255,000 in fines and costs.

FT  21 JAN 93 / London's export slide casts recovery gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORT orders and deliveries among London's manufacturers fell for the third
consecutive quarter in the three months to December, in contrast with most
other regions, Emma Tucker writes.
The London Chamber of Commerce says in its latest quarterly economic survey
published today that domestic orders and deliveries also continued to
decline, while 82 per cent of manufacturers were operating below capacity.
The survey suggests that London is still suffering more than the rest of the
country, with no sign of recovery yet.
Exporters fared slightly better after sterling's devaluation in September,
but the chamber believes there will be no growth in exports during the first
quarter of this year.
Recent cuts in base rates have been slow to take effect and business
confidence is depressed by rising unemployment and sluggish activity.
The survey says London's short-term employment prospects are the poorest in
the country. Almost 40 per cent of manufacturers and 35 per cent of
service-sector companies have cut staff in response to lower demand.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Insolvency law seen as 'bayoneting wounded'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S largest insolvency practitioners yesterday called for urgent
changes to the law on insolvency in order to save thousands of companies
from failing.
The insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, wants reforms
of the 1986 Insolvency Act to foster a 'rescue culture' to remove the stigma
of insolvency.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of the insolvency arm, formerly called Cork Gully,
said in its annual review: 'The existing law in too many cases still amounts
to a prescription to bayonet the wounded.'
He also called for tougher action against rogue directors and said only two
cases had led to successful prosecutions for wrongful trading since 1986.
'Some of the worst examples of bad corporate governance are going
unpunished,' he said.
Mr Hughes said the 1986 act was intended to foster a rescue culture, but it
had not lived up to expectations or led to an increase in the number of
businesses rehabilitated.
The firm estimated that less than 1 per cent of all companies in some form
of insolvency were using a procedure such as administration that might lead
to their rescue.
It projected that without any change there would be about 80,000 failures in
1993, unchanged on last year's total.
'A significant number could have been handled in a better way and have
survived,' Mr Hughes said.
He called for the introduction of a Companies' Charter which would help to
prevent worthwhile businesses collapsing and reduce bureaucracy associated
with existing procedures.
He said company voluntary arrangements should be amended to enable companies
to achieve a court-ordered 'stay of execution' from dis-affected creditors
to give management time to propose a rescue plan. He said administration
orders, introduced in 1986, were normally considered 'receivership by
another name'.
They were seen as too tortuous and expensive, and there were few success
stories where they had worked effectively.
The calls echo appeals made for more than two years by the Society of
Practitioners of Insolvency, the main trade body, which have gone largely
unheeded by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The DTI said yesterday that ministers kept legislation under review but had
no plans to introduce new insolvency laws. The department said it would be
examining company voluntary arrangements as part of a scrutiny of company
law announced last November.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Hospital shake-up 'may cost Pounds 198m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE capital costs of restructuring medical education and research under the
government's Tomlinson report recommendations for London healthcare would be
Pounds 146m to Pounds 198m, says a study by KPMG Management Consulting.
The report, commissioned by London University, says these costs could not be
offset by revenue from the sale of university surplus property and existing
capital grants. 'Even at the lower end of the projected range of costs there
is a substantial shortfall.' Assuming property sales were successful, the
report puts the university's net capital costs at Pounds 70m to Pounds 140m.
Opponents of the Tomlinson recommendations to close or reorganise a number
of London hospitals will be heartened by the report, the latest of several
to question financial aspects of the proposals.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is due to make decisions on
the report early next month. She is under pressure from some parliamentary
colleagues to tread cautiously, in spite of earlier declarations by health
ministers that radical action was required to tackle the capital's
healthcare problems.
Professor Sir Colin Dollery, pro vice-chancellor for medicine at London
University, said yesterday the KPMG report identified a 'desperate need' for
substantial extra capital grant even if only part of the Tomlinson
recommendations were implemented.
KPMG says it has 'erred on the side of underestimating' the likely capital
costs for the university. Some elements of KPMG's cost estimates were
unacceptable to the medical schools involved. If their views were accepted,
costs would increase significantly.
University property disposals might, says the report, raise Pounds 45m to
Pounds 55m. 'However, it should be stressed that realising these values will
depend on the university's ability to sell medical school property. This
will be influenced by market conditions at the time of sale, the demand for
this type of property in London, and the amount of similar property which is
on the market as a result of health service disposals.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / 100,000 job losses feared at councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100,000 redund-ancies are likely in local government in the next
two years, say the compilers of a survey of council personnel directors
released yesterday. The figure is about 10 per cent of the workforce.
The estimate in a survey of 55 authorities by the CAMC Personnel Policy
Research Unit was dismissed by Mr John Redwood, local government minister,
as 'scaremongering'.
Last week's Local Government Chronicle estimated that more than 33,000
full-time posts were at risk in England over the next 15 months.
The government's marginal relaxation of local spending controls announced
this week was welcomed by councils but the Association of County Councils
suggested it was less generous than the Pounds 150m estimate. The move gives
17 councils 1.5 per cent more for their 'notional amount' - the basis for
government calculations - but in only four is there a similar percentage
rise in the capping limit.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Europarks 'became damaged goods'
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL espionage allegedly ordered by Mr Gordon Layton, the former chief
executive of National Car Parks, could have cost his main business rival
millions of pounds, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Stephen Tucker, former head of Europarks, the car parking company, said
he had 'lost the future' of his business after it had became public
knowledge that KAS, a security company, had allegedly spied on Europarks for
NCP. Europarks had become 'damaged goods' when it had become known that NCP
had obtained confidential information about it.
Documents allegedly obtained by KAS for NCP would have been very valuable to
a business rival, he agreed. These included documents about potential future
sites, Europarks' financial position and plans to turn it into a public
company.
He sold his company to NCP in 1990 for Pounds 3.3m and accept-ed Pounds 1m
damages, the court heard.
Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS employee, both deny conspiring
to defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to its
business affairs between January 1987 and November 1989. The trial continues
today.

INVESTORS IN PEOPLE, the government's main scheme for improving the training
of people in work, is 'still in low gear', Training and Enterprise Councils
told a Commons select committee yesterday.
Representatives of Tecs, which administer publicly funded training
programmes in England and Wales, along with a range of other initiatives
including IIP, were giving evidence to the Commons employment committee.
Written evidence drawn from the 82 Tecs said that IIP was a key tool in
aiding business performance. But it said: 'There is some concern over the
national profile and backing, and the resource dedicated to the initiative
is small. It is still in low gear.'
Tecs said in written evidence that for most companies the national education
and training targets - set by the Confederation of British Industry and
endorsed by government - were a 'remote and unrecognised part of some
national agenda'.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Freight fillip for privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO COMPANIES gave the government's privatisation plans a fillip yesterday
by separately announcing plans to take advantage of the liberalised regime.
Mendip Rail, a newly formed company, announced that it was to take over the
operation of locomotives belonging to the only two companies regularly
operating their own engines on BR tracks and offer freight services in
competition with BR.
The two companies are Foster Yeoman and ARC, aggregates suppliers with
quarries in Somerset. They have agreed to pool their nine locomotives and
600 wagons under the management of Mendip Rail. The new company will be
headed by Mr Robin Gisby, founder of the Charterail rail freight company
which went into liquidation last year.
National Power is buying one locomotive from General Motors in Canada and 21
wagons from Powell Duffryn in the UK to move limestone between Buxton in
Derbyshire and the Drax power station in North Yorkshire.
National Power said it had no intention of becoming a large-scale train
operator itself, but hoped its example would encourage other companies to
enter the market.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Uphill steps towards consensus: An initiative to encourage
compromise over the political future of Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENTATIVE steps in search of a settlement in Northern Ireland were taken
this week, not in the stately setting of Stormont or Dublin Castle, but in a
rundown Belfast arts centre across the road from an office block that was
bombed last year.
An independent commission of inquiry chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an
international human rights lawyer, and made up of academics and former civil
servants ranging from Mr Eamonn Gallagher, a former EC commissioner, to Lady
Faulkner, the widow of the last Stormont prime minister, has held public
hearings of a broad section of local opinion.
The commission, funded by charities including the Joseph Rowntree Trust, is
the idea of Initiative '92, a non-political group led by Mr Robin Wilson, a
local journalist, and Professor Simon Lee, a law professor at Queen's
University, Belfast.
It arose out of frustration over the continuing absence of an agreement
between the political parties and the persistent campaign of terrorist
violence. Mr Wilson says it 'offers the best chance for an opening in the
political logjam here'.
Its aim is to encourage a climate of debate and tolerance while focusing
people's minds on possible compromises. By early summer it intends to have
distilled the mass of written and oral evidence it has received into
proposals which might win popular acceptance.
Unionist party leaders have accused the commission of setting out to
undermine the political process, and have boycotted it. One leading Unionist
called it an 'exercise by an upper-middle-class group of people who have
played no active part in politics'.
But Unionist councillors and other representatives of the Protestant
community have taken part, and its apparent desire to make a constructive
contribution has secured at least moral support for its endeavours from both
London and Dublin.
'We are trying to bypass the otherwise insuperable barrier of waiting for a
voluntary inter-party agreement. Proposals from the commission could catch
the popular mind and provide something for the government to run with,' says
Mr Wilson.
The commission has got off to an encouraging start. Yesterday Lady Faulkner
 -who seven years ago was a member of the BBC board of governors which
blocked the screening of a documentary on terrorism - sat patiently
listening to Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, which is banned
from talks with the government.
Lady Faulkner said before hearing Mr McLaughlin: 'If we are to produce
something forward-looking, we can't have axes to grind. I feel that what we
are seeing is a more realistic approach to the situation from both
Protestant and Catholic communities than existed before.'
Mr McLaughlin was only one of hundreds of individuals and organisations
participating in the commission's proceedings. Some demonstrated a degree of
tolerance which would have been unthinkable during the worst years of the
troubles.
Thus on Monday a Presbyterian moderator stood side-by-side with a community
worker from the nationalist Falls Road area of Belfast whose son had been
murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries and stated: 'We must work with models of
co-operation and not of domination or assimilation.'
Earlier Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the former head of the Northern Ireland
civil service, said he had detected less 'exclusiveness' among ordinary
people. 'I think the situation is ripe to move forward.'
Beyond good intentions, the commission faces an uphill struggle to draw up
an agenda which might be of use to the politicians.
The commissioners say the submissions display widespread disillusionment and
apathy, while providing little sense of what alternative forms of government
and constitutional changes may be needed.
Where the submissions have been more illuminating is in identifying specific
'second-tier' policy measures which might create a better climate for future
talks to succeed.
There appears to be consensus in both communities on issues such as the need
for a bill of rights, better integrated housing and education and more
outside investment.
Ms Marie Fitzduff, director of the Northern Ireland Community Relations
Council, says the consensus reflects growing practical co-operation across
the religious divide at grassroots level.
And yet, as the 'revenge' shooting of a Catholic woman in Belfast this week
showed, it will take more than the commission's efforts to appease the men
of violence.

FT  21 JAN 93 / MPs divided on BR sell-off plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, was yesterday battling to defend his
rail privatisation in the run-up to tomorrow's publication of the Railways
Bill.
There was some relief for him when it emerged that one of the main focuses
of opposition to his plans - the cross-party Commons transport committee -
was convulsed by internal dissent.
Hostility to the plans has thrived amid growing confusion over what they
mean for freight and passenger customers. The confusion has arisen because
the government's plans involve a complex mix of continued state ownership
for the tracks, outright sale for freight operations, and contracting-out to
the private sector for passenger services.
One of the most outspoken opponents of the privatisation plans has been Mr
Robert Adley, the Conservative backbencher and railway enthusiast who chairs
the Commons committee investigating the government's proposals.
Yesterday the committee produced an interim report which had been expected
to be highly critical of the government's plans. Instead, it confined itself
to raising a series of 'unresolved issues'.
It later emerged that the report had been agreed only after one Conservative
member of the committee, Mr Matthew Banks, MP for Southport, had insisted on
substantial amendments and deletions. Another Conservative member, Mr Nick
Hawkins, MP for Blackpool South, dissociated himself from any implied
criticism. Mr Adley said the report was inevitably a compromise between
strongly held views.
The report drew strong support from opposition parties, the public-transport
lobby and the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail passengers'
watchdog.
The watchdog echoed MPs' concerns that franchising was incompatible with
open access, that it could prove impractical to separate track ownership
from train operation and that network benefits such as through-ticketing
could be lost.
Mr MacGregor said he had already agreed that some franchises could be
exclusive and that others could include tracks as well as trains. The
government had also promised that through-ticketing would be preserved, he
said.
Earlier, Mr MacGregor told a rail freight conference in London organised by
the Waterfront Partnership consultancy that the introduction of track
charges need not necessarily drive freight off the rails, 'providing they
can cover the real costs of using the track'.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Warning over inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTERCARE and support for foreign companies which have chosen to locate in
Britain should now be the key priority for inward investment agencies, a
leading specialist in the field said yesterday.
Professor Neil Hood, director of the Strathclyde International Business Unit
and former director of Locate in Scotland, warned that most agencies were
ill-equipped to play this role.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Two more banks may limit pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank and Lloyds Bank are expected to follow the lead of National
Westminster Bank and offer no general pay increase this year, David Goodhart
writes.
Lloyds said it was permanently abandoning general increases in favour of pay
rises based only on performance. It is the first big clearing bank to
propose a performance-only pay system. It expects about 75 per cent of its
48,000 staff to get some pay rise this year, but the banking union, Bifu,
said only 25 per cent of staff would be assured of a pay rise.
Barclays said it had not decided its response to the claim. But Bifu said
the bank had rejected it, and 'we expect them to make a nil offer'.
A second one-day strike planned for tomorrow against job losses at the TSB
bank has been postponed after talks at Acas, the conciliation service, which
will resume on Monday.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Price rise sought for top ITV serial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA Television is seeking a large increase in the price paid by the ITV
network for its main ratings winner, Coronation Street.
Granada is believed to be seeking a 25 per cent increase in what the ITV
network pays for the 'soap' which regularly attracts audiences ranging from
19.6m to 21.8m.
The television company could threaten to take Coronation Street elsewhere,
such as the BBC, under new tariff arrangements. While this is unlikely, it
highlights the difficulty faced by ITV in deciding what to pay for
programmes.
Under the old regime there was a fixed tariff for each programme type,
irrespective of what individual programmes cost to make.
From next autumn the network centre will have an annual budget of Pounds
515m to spend on programmes - approximately last year's total with an
increase in line with inflation - and the tariff will be replaced by
individual negotiations with programme makers.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Health scheme cost put at Pounds 198m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE capital costs of restructuring medical education and research under the
government's Tomlinson report recommendations for London healthcare would be
Pounds 146m to Pounds 198m, says a study by KPMG Management Consulting.
The report, commissioned by London University, says these costs could not be
offset by revenue from the sale of university surplus property and existing
capital grants. 'Even at the lower end of the projected range of costs there
is a substantial shortfall.' Assuming property sales were successful, the
report puts the university's net capital costs at Pounds 70m to Pounds 140m.
Opponents of the Tomlinson recommendations to close or reorganise a number
of London hospitals will be heartened by the report.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is due to make decisions on
the report early next month. She is under pressure from some parliamentary
colleagues to tread cautiously in spite of earlier declarations by health
ministers that radical action was required to tackle the capital's
healthcare problems.
Professor Sir Colin Dollery, pro vice-chancellor for medicine at London
University, said yesterday the KPMG report identified a 'desperate need' for
substantial extra capital grant even if only part of the Tomlinson
recommendations were implemented.
KPMG says it has 'erred on the side of underestimating' the likely capital
costs for the university. Some elements of KPMG's cost estimates were
unacceptable to the medical schools involved. If their views were accepted,
costs would increase significantly.
University property disposals might, says the report, raise Pounds 45m to
Pounds 55m. 'However, it should be stressed that realising these values will
depend on the university's ability to sell medical school property.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / Europarks was 'damaged goods'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL espionage allegedly ordered by Mr Gordon Layton, the former chief
executive of National Car Parks, could have cost his main business rival
millions of pounds, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Stephen Tucker, former head of Europarks, the car parking company, said
he had 'lost the future' of his business after it became public knowledge
that KAS, a security company, had allegedly spied on Europarks for NCP.
Europarks had become 'damaged goods', Mr Tucker said.
Documents allegedly obtained by KAS for NCP would have been very valuable to
a business rival, he agreed. These included documents about potential future
sites, Europarks' financial position and plans to turn it into a public
company.
His company was left in a very poor position to compete with NCP and
potential purchasers of Europarks were well aware its most sensitive
information was in the hands of NCP, Mr Tucker said.
He sold his company to NCP in 1990 for Pounds 3.3m and accepted Pounds 1m
damages, the court heard. Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bankers, had advised
him the company was worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m, he said.
Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS employee, both deny conspiring
to defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to its
business affairs between January 1987 and November 1989. The trial continues
today.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Councils 'planning 100,000 job cuts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100,000 redundancies are likely in local government during the
next two years, says a survey of council personnel directors released
yesterday. The figure is about 10 per cent of the workforce.
The estimate, in a survey of 55 authorities across Britain by the CAMC
Personnel Policy Research Unit, is the most gloomy yet. It was dismissed by
Mr John Redwood, local government minister, as 'scaremongering'.
The survey found that councils were set to make redundant the equivalent of
84,000 full-time employees, amounting to the loss of 'well in excess' of
100,000 jobs. That was on top of losses through natural wastage.
Last week's Local Government Chronicle estimated that more than 33,000
full-time posts were at risk in England over the next 15 months.
The CAMC research shows white-collar staff such as architects, site
supervisors and senior officers are likely to bear the brunt of the
redundancies, with compulsory competitive tendering and the current local
government review blamed for many of the projected job losses.
Mr Redwood said most councils he had spoken to recently 'have assured me
that they will not be making people compulsorily redundant'.
The government's marginal relaxation of local spending controls announced
earlier this week was welcomed by councils yesterday, but the Association of
County Councils suggested it was less generous than the government's
estimate of Pounds 150m.
Among shire counties, London boroughs and metropolitan districts, the
relaxation has given 17 councils an increase of 1.5 per cent in their
'notional amount' - the sum which is the basis of government calculations -
but in only four of these is there a similar percentage rise in the capping
limit, because of the method used to determine capping.
The most extreme example is Kent, where an increase of Pounds 16m in
notional amount does not change its capping limit.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Jaguar seeks 25% sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the luxury carmaker, aims to increase sales worldwide by more than
25 per cent this year to about 28,300, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief
executive, said yesterday.
The company, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, is trying to halt the drastic
decline it has suffered in the past four years in which its sales have more
than halved and in which it has fallen into heavy losses.
Mr Scheele said Jaguar was aiming to launch its planned new range of smaller
sporty saloons - intended to compete with the likes of the BMW 5 Series - by
1998.
The company would decide in the spring whether the new car, code-named X200,
would be part of the world luxury car programmebeing planned by Ford in the
US to provide a range of medium-sized luxury cars for both North America and
Europe.
Jaguar said that its retail sales worldwide fell last year by 12.4 per cent
to 22,478 - the lowest level since 1982 . The fall was from 25,661 in 1991
and from a peak of 49,494 in 1988.
Production fell last year by 10.5 per cent to 20,593 - the lowest level
since 1981 - from 23,0918 in 1991 and from a peak of 51,939 in 1988.
Mr Scheele said the company's financial performance had improved last year
from the record pre-tax loss of Pounds 226m suffered in 1991, but he refused
to disclose detailed figures.
The Jaguar UK workforce, which has been reduced by 44 per cent in the past
two years, fell to 6,759 at the end of last year from 7,928 a year earlier
and from 12,050 at the end of 1990.
The company forecast yesterday that the main impetus for its sales recovery
would come from the US, where it is seeking to increase sales by more than
40 per cent this year to 12,500 from 8,681 last year.
Its US sales, which fell by 7.4 per cent last year from 9,376 in 1991, have
fallen by nearly two thirds in the past six years from a peak of 24,464 in
1986.
Mr Scheele said that the company also planned to increase significantly its
marketing effort in Germany and Japan, where sales dropped heavily last
year.
In Germany it is seeking to increase sales to more than 3,000 this year from
1,881 in 1992. In Japan, where its sales fell by 38 per cent last year,
Jaguar is aiming to raise registrations to 2,500 from 1,501 last year.
Jaguar also aims to enter a series of new markets in order to bolster its
worldwide sales. This year it plans to start sales in China for the first
time.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Asia's capital of deprivation seeks the
capital of hope - After decades of economic decline, Marxist-run Calcutta is
trying to attract foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALCUTTA, with its dirt, decay and human deprivation, breeds a gritty sense
of determination. Thus there was little surprise that the city's businessmen
went ahead this month with their first international trade fair despite the
turmoil of the Ayodhya crisis.
Officials of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry freely admit
crumbling roads and buildings, crowds, noise and pollution make Calcutta one
of the world's least attractive cities for first-time visitors. As they say
in a report, any newcomer 'would be psychologically put off immediately and
decide to leave the city as quickly as possible'.
Nor are business visitors likely to be encouraged by the frequent power cuts
or the grim posters of Marx, Lenin and Stalin put up by supporters of West
Bengal's Communist-led government.
The fair's organisers pressed on with the event despite the violence which
hit the city following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. They took
comfort from the fact that the riots in Calcutta were relatively small,
causing 43 deaths compared with hundreds in Bombay.
The fair, which ended this week, attracted 2,000 business visitors, less
than the original target of 3,000 but enough to justify holding the event
and to prompt the chamber to consider making it an annual event. Mr Pradip
Dasgupta, the chamber's secretary, says: 'In the prevailing circumstances,
it has been very satisfactory. We got 1,000 enquiries.'
It will take time for such enquiries to turn into firm orders let alone into
decisions to invest in the city. Nevertheless, after decades of economic
decline, Calcutta is trying to stop the rot. Encouraged by the national
government's free-market oriented reforms, even West Bengal's Marxists have
been persuaded to embrace capitalism. Mr Jyoti Basu, the Marxist chief
minister who has been in power since 1977, says that the capitalism he once
fought no longer exists: 'We welcome business.'
Unfortunately, business has so far been less than fulsome in its response.
The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, a state economic agency,
proudly lists 254 investment plans filed by entrepreneurs since the central
government announced economic liberalisation in July 1991. The agency claims
that the investments total Rs53bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and would generate 63,482
jobs.
The list is headed by a Rs32bn scheme for a petrochemicals complex at
Haldia, a greenfield site near Calcutta, to be built by West Bengal state in
partnership with the Tata group, India's largest private conglomerate.
Other large schemes include a Rs7.5bn pig iron plant proposed by S K Birla,
a leading Calcutta group, and a Rs3.9bn plastics factory to be built by
Reliance, a textiles and chemicals group. Construction work on the Haldia
project, which was first mooted long before the 1991 economic reforms, is
due to start this year, about 12 months later than planned.
But it is not yet clear when some of the other large schemes will be
realised. Most of the investments are modest; for example, the expansion and
small-scale modernisation of forging, steelmaking and engineering
industries, all long-established in Bengal. Foreign investment is also of
limited scale, such as a Rs300m factory for refractory bricks used in
steel-making to be built this year by Vesuvius, a subsidiary of Cookson, the
UK chemicals maker.
The reluctance of businessmen is easily understood. Calcuttans long accepted
the city's decline as the result of the burdens imposed by floods, and of
refugees from war and natural disasters. Mr Basu's state government tried to
fight poverty as it thought best, but its efforts compounded Calcutta's
difficulties by promoting over-powerful trade unions and alienating
business. To make matters worse, India's ruling Congress (I) party felt
little inclination to divert state investments to West Bengal.
Calcutta's industrial groups kept their head offices in the city, but new
investments have mostly gone into other parts of India. According to the
Chamber of Commerce, industrial investment in West Bengal, which grew at an
annual rate of 9 per cent as late as the mid-1960s, was shrinking by 0.5 per
cent in the mid-1980s. Factories, roads and sewers crumble through lack of
investment, and a choking smog permeates the air. What was once the richest
city in Asia has become a monument to urban poverty.
It will take time to overcome the effects of years of stagnation. Top of
many businessmen's concerns is the state's acute shortage of electricity
since power cuts occur daily.
Similarly, although the city's roads and public services were the envy of
India as late as the mid-1960s, the long years of neglect have taken their
toll.
Calcuttan businessmen have to think hard to come up with some advantages to
match the city's manifest disadvantages. They talk of the high skill levels
of Bengali workers and are proud of the city's historical international
commercial links, especially with Britain.
But, as Mr Biji Kurien, president of the chamber of commerce, says: 'It is
hard to sell Calcutta and even harder when other cities in India are also
trying to attract investment.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Vanished satellite 'may have blown up'

AN Australian satellite which disappeared after being launched by a Chinese
rocket may have been damaged by an explosion, a Hong Kong newspaper with
close links to Beijing said yesterday.
Wen Wei Po, a Chinese-language daily, said fragments recovered by a Sino/US
investigating team suggested the explosion occurred after the satellite was
deployed.
The report echoes findings by the US journal Aviation Week and Space News
which this week said the nose 'shroud', or cone, of the rocket disintegrated
at 23,000ft, exposing the satellite to a 1,000mph slipstream that destroyed
it.
If the reports are confirmed by official investigations, it would damage
China's efforts to break into the lucrative satellite launch market
dominated by western companies, which charge high prices for their services.
The newspaper reiterated earlier claims by China's Aerospace Ministry that
the accident was not caused by a failure of the Long March rocket used to
launch the satellite from south-west China last month.
The Dollars 138m (Pounds 90.7m) satellite was built by Hughes Aircraft, the
US aerospace group, for Optus Communications, an Australian
telecommunications company which planned to use it for phone and
broadcasting services. Optus has said it expects Hughes to supply a
replacement satellite as part of a ADollars 500m (Pounds 226.2m) contract to
build and launch the two satellites. The replacement one could be launched
within 18 months.
China launched its first satellite for an overseas client in April 1990,
when a Long March rocket put Asiasat-1 into geostationary orbit for a Hong
Kong-based consortium. Optus is owned by BellSouth of the US, Cable and
Wireless of the UK, and Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport group.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Brittan blitz on Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, European Community trade commissioner, plans a blitz of
top-level meetings next week aimed at achieving a rapid end to the Uruguay
Round of world trade talks.
Plans to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, his newly-appointed US counterpart, in
Washington have yet to be confirmed. He will meet Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),
tentatively next Wednesday, and other leaders concerned with the Uruguay
Round at the following weekend's Davos summit.
The initiative coincides with calls to the incoming US administration, whose
views on the Uruguay Round and wider trade policy remain unclear, to make a
final push to complete the six-year-old talks before the negotiating mandate
granted by Congress expires in March.
Mr Dunkel said yesterday after a stock-taking meeting of the Trade
Negotiations Committee (TNC) which oversees the 112-nation liberalisation
talks: 'We are critically short of time. We must conclude now or risk
drifting into the sands.'
Sir Leon, who assumed responsibility for EC trade policy three weeks ago,
has moved swiftly to press for a rapid end to the talks. After a meeting
outside London on January 2 (a day after assuming office) with Mrs Carla
Hills, outgoing US trade representative, he agreed with the US to focus
negotiations on tariff cuts on manufactured goods.
'We have not reached agreement,' he commented this week. 'But we have not
wasted our time. We have injected new urgency into the process and have
prepared the ground for a successful conclusion.' He clearly hopes the
meetings next week will provide fresh momentum at a time when success or
failure almost certainly depends on the priority given to the Uruguay Round
talks by President Clinton.
At present, Mr Clinton's trade priorities are unclear. Mr Kantor, who spends
his first day today as US trade representative, gave mixed signals on likely
policy priorities when he appeared before the Senate finance committee for
his nomination hearing. His deputies have not yet been named, but the people
chosen will provide important signals on how policy will be shaped.
'We see no sign that suggests we should be worried there will be any
increase in US protectionism, and remain totally open to building up
contacts with the new administration,' a spokesman for Sir Leon said
yesterday.
He refused to comment directly on remarks by Mr Kantor at his nomination
hearing indicating 'deep concern' over aspects of November's US-EC agreement
to reduce farm subsidies.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Bankruptcies in Japan rise at record rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CORPORATE bankruptcies are rising at the fastest rate in Japanese history,
according to a report published yesterday by a private research group which
said bankruptcies rose by 32.1 per cent last year.
The report by the Teikoku Data Bank shows that the number of bankruptcies
has more than doubled from a low of 6,468 in 1990 to 14,167 last year.
This is a faster rate of growth in the annual number of bankruptcies than at
any point since the company started collecting statistics in 1965.
The report's findings suggest that Japanese companies have become much more
vulnerable to bankruptcy than they were in the 1970s.
At the height of the first oil shock, bankruptcies rose from 7,140 in 1972
to 11,705 two years later.
The last time bankruptcies rose strongly was in the early 1980s when they
increased from 17,122 in 1982 to 20,841 two years later.
However, in spite of the severity of the slowdown in the Japanese economy
over the past two years the number of bankruptcies last year was still below
the average annual rate in the 1980s of 15,891.
The overall value of bankruptcies fell by 5 per cent to Y7,563bn (Pounds
38.8bn) last year reflecting the rise in failures among small businesses.
Teikoku Data Bank said 48 per cent of bankruptcies were the result of the
recession, up by 10 percentage points from last year. Real estate
bankruptcies were 12.9 per cent up at 1,170.
Bankruptcies in December were 9.5 per cent up from November at 1,454, which
has a 20 per cent increase on December 1991, when there were 1,204
bankruptcies.
One factor behind the rise in bankruptcies is the tougher approach which has
been adopted among Japan's banks which are carrying a heavy burden of bad
loans.
The number of companies with which banks suspended trading last year grew by
18.3 per cent to 10,728 companies.
These companies had debts of Y4,322bn, 2.9 per cent up from 1991, according
to the Federation of Bankers' Associations.
Last month an estimated 1,070 companies were suspended, up 3.5 per cent from
the year before.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Fiscal deficit puts Pakistan's economy at risk: Mounting
defence and debt costs hamper government attempts to bring public spending
under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG shadow of excessive public spending hangs over Pakistan's economy.
Its baleful influence is not immediately apparent since the country is
enjoying a surge in economic growth prompted by successive good harvests and
by wide-ranging economic liberalisation. Textiles factories are working flat
out to fill export orders, while farmers sell produce to the Middle East.
City centre shops are stocked with imported luxuries; in Karachi, rows of
Japanese cars stand on the dockside waiting for customers who have the money
to buy even Mitsubishi Pajeros, costing up to Dollars 58,000 (Pounds 38,200)
each. Last autumn's damaging floods have slowed expansion not halted it -
the economy is still expected to grow by 5.5 per cent in the financial year
to June 1993.
However, the government continues to spend so much itself that it could yet
undermine its achievements of the last two years since Mr Nawaz Sharif, the
prime minister, came to power and launched radical economic reforms.
The State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, singled out the deficit for
criticism in its annual report for 1991-92, published last month. 'A high
level of fiscal deficit continues to be the central concern for the managers
of Pakistan's economy.'
Businessmen share the central bank's fears. 'I am very impressed with
Pakistan's progress,' says Mr H J Hemmen, chairman of the Pakistani
affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and detergents group, 'But the
macroeconomic environment is worrying. They must bring public spending under
control.'
The government has been trying to deal with the gap between revenue and
expenditure since it took office.
For the year to June 1992, it set a target of 5 per cent of national output
for the fiscal deficit. The actual result was 7.8 per cent, according to the
central bank. For the current year, too, the government has already given up
hope of reaching the 5 per cent target. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance
minister, admits: 'The only area where progress is difficult is the budget
deficit.'
The basic problem is that defence soaks up around 35 per cent of public
spending and a further 25 per cent goes on debt servicing. Cutting debt
servicing is almost impossible without reneging on agreements with
creditors. Military spending is also sacrosanct as long as relations with
India remain hostile. Mr Aziz takes comfort from the fact that increases in
defence spending have been kept in line with inflation, but concedes that
cuts are off the agenda.
The reformist government had hoped to reduce civilian administrative costs -
but progress has been slow since the bureaucracy, a powerful force in
Pakistan, is loathe to pull in its belt.
The inability to cut such big items leaves the government with little scope
for increasing those programmes which are essential for economic
development, such as expanding transport networks and the power supply.
It is also difficult to accommodate emergencies - such as the autumn floods
which, as well as causing death and destruction to large communities, cost
the government Rs4bn-Rs5bn (Pounds 100m-Pounds 126m).
Mr Aziz's main strategy has been to raise revenues, including taxes.
According to the central bank report, tax income rose 28.9 per cent in the
year to June 1992, due both to economic growth and to the expansion of a
system of 'withholding' taxes.
These are VAT-like levies charged on various economic activities including
paying and receiving interest, importing and even using electricity. They
have been devised as a partial substitute for income tax, which is widely
evaded in Pakistan.
Taxpayers who believe they pay too much in withholding taxes are entitled to
appeal but they must file a detailed tax return. Few do and withholding
taxes account for two-thirds of total tax revenue.
Unfortunately, such widespread use of indirect taxes is no substitute for
direct taxes and in itself creates widespread opportunities for abuse and
corruption. The government is trying to improve income tax collection but
progress will be limited as long as politically-powerful groups such as
farmers enjoy tax exemptions.
Tax reforms are necessary not only for the health of public finances but of
the economy as a whole. The central bank report estimates 70 per cent of the
new credit created during the economic surge of the last two years has been
swallowed up by the public sector. If this continues, companies will be
unable to benefit from the government's deregulation and privatisation
programme.
As the central bank says: 'Expectations of an increasingly larger role of
the private sector in the economy are at variance with a situation where the
preponderant credit increase during the year goes to the government.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / Unita rebels seize Angolan oil town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

   LUANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITA rebels have scored a notable victory in their war against Angolan
government troops with the capture of the oil town of Soyo, which accounts
for a third of Angola's production, Reuter reports from Luanda.
An Angolan armed forces communique issued yesterday admitted that the
government had lost the country's most important oil centre.
'After two days of heavy fighting between government forces and Unita,
backed by Zairean forces and mercenaries, the government was forced to
withdraw from the town of Soyo,' the communique said.
Unita was reported to have set ablaze several oil wells as well as seizing
17 foreign oil workers after two days of fierce battles. Attempts were being
made to open talks to win the release of the foreigners.
The fall of Soyo is a serious blow to the government, which desperately
needs cash from oil exports to fund its war against Unita.
Oil earns some 90 per cent of Angola's foreign revenues and the
north-western town of Soyo accounted for a third of the country's daily
production of more than 500,000 barrels.
Scores of foreigners, many of them Portuguese, were evacuated from the area
by boat and helicopter. But Fina Petroleos de Angola said 17 expatriates,
some from service companies, had been unable to get away in time.
Unita's Voice of the Black Cockerel radio confirmed foreigners were in rebel
hands and said heavy fighting was also taking place on the Huambo, Menongwe,
Moxico, Saurimo and Malanje fronts.
State media said Cabinda was tense and authorities feared Unita might be
preparing an attack on the enclave sandwiched between Zaire and the Congo.
Since disputing the results of September elections which it lost to the
ruling MPLA, Unita has expelled local authorities from some 70 per cent of
Angolan territory - including northern diamond areas - in violation of May
1991 peace accords.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A United Nations envoy yesterday delivered the sharpest warning to date of
Security Council anger over Israel's refusal to reverse the expulsion of 415
Palestinians to Lebanon, saying it would not wait longer for a positive
Israeli response.
However, Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, sent by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros
Ghali on the third UN mission since the expulsions on December 17, said he
could not give a deadline for Israeli compliance with Security Council
resolution 799 condemning the action as illegal and demanding it be
overturned.
Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said Israel was waiting for a High
Court ruling on the legality of the expulsions, due within days, before
deciding its next step.
The government is concerned that the US, which usually vetoes hostile UN
moves against it, could allow further Security Council action on the issue
because of strong international feeling that Israel has benfited from double
standards in the Security Council in the light of attacks on Iraq.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Japanese wins bitter battle to lead WHO
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan yesterday won his battle for re-election as
director-general of the World Health Organisation, but the bitterly
contested campaign, which pitted Japan against the US, has seriously scarred
the UN agency.
The 31-member executive board of the WHO voted 18 to 13 to nominate Dr
Nakajima for another five-year term from next July. The defeated candidate,
Dr Mohamed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian, was supported by the US, the EC and
the Arab League.
However, Dr Nakajima had the backing of most developing countries which
constitute a majority on the board. This makes it virtually certain that his
nomination will be confirmed by WHO's 170-plus members at the World Health
Assembly in May.
For months the Geneva air has been thick with accusations and denials, on
both sides, of vote-buying with aid and jobs. The US, which finances a
quarter of WHO's Dollars 850m (Pounds 559.2m) a year budget, complains that
Japan had gone well beyond the limits of persuasive diplomacy in promoting
Dr Nakajima's candidacy. Japan, the agency's second biggest contributor,
says the US has been pursuing a disinformation campaign against it.
Dr Nakajima, a 64-year-old pharmacologist, became WHO director-general in
1988 after nine years as regional director for the western Pacific. Within a
year there were signs of a collapse in staff morale, and rumblings of
discontent from western donor countries concerned about the impact on WHO
programmes.
These were given added impetus by the resignation of Dr Jonathan Mann, a
world-renowned Aids expert, as head of the WHO's aids programme in March
1990 after a row with his boss. But no suitable alternative candidate was
found to stand against Dr Nakajima until Dr Abdelmoumene, his deputy, was
persuaded to run.
By that time the Japanese government, which only belatedly backed Dr
Nakajima first time around, had decided his re-election was a matter of
national policy.
However, with its two biggest contributors at loggerheads, its performance
under Dr Nakajima's leadership in question, and many of its 4,700 staff
unhappy and demoralised, the WHO has a difficult five years ahead.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Baghdad breathes a heavy sigh of relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S offer of a ceasefire was met with relief by ordinary residents of
Baghdad yesterday, who were sharply reminded of the perils of the Gulf war
by Sunday night's air attack on the capital.
But Iraqis are far from confident that things will change fundamentally for
the better in the short term.
They have been struggling under the trade embargo imposed by the United
Nations Security Council for nearly 2 1/2 years and there seems little
reason to hope this will be rescinded soon, even with the advent of a new
president in the White House.
'All presidents of the US are the same,' said an Iraqi academic yesterday.
With most of its foreign assets frozen and the central bank's foreign
currency reserves severely depleted, Iraq's ability to continue subsidising
its self-sufficiency drive at current levelsis questionable.
The severity of the economic situation in Iraq is apparent from the regime's
attempts to implement an austerity programme at the same time as increasing
concessions to the armed forces and the middle classes.
Last month's ban on the import of 146 luxury items was accompanied by a 30
per cent pay increase for all government employees and a 40 per cent
increase for the army and senior officials. The pay increases are expected
to come into effect sometime this month.
Amid the latest clashes between the allies and Iraq came an increase of up
to 20 per cent on monthly rations such as sugar, tea, rice, flour, cooking
oil, soap and detergents last Monday, and other concessions are said to be
in the pipeline.
Child allowances are expected to be raised from two Iraqi dinars per child
per month to ID25 (Pounds 43 at the official rate) and the labour law is due
for amendment to fix minimum salaries and annual pay rises.
Although the drive for self-sufficiency in food is the acknowledged goal of
the government, Iraq remains reliant on imports in virtually every sector
apart from that of oil.
In 1989 it spent an estimated Dollars 7.68bn on imports (although Dollars
2.7bn was for military purposes) and some argue it has only survived this
long under international sanctions by paying out subsidies.
Mr Mohammed Mahdi Salih, the minister of trade and industry, has argued that
the impressive reconstruction programme since the end of the war - 90 per
cent of damage from allied air attacks has been repaired, according to the
Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction - was paid for not in foreign
currency but by using construction materials in stock and local production.
But the country's gold-for-wheat deal, which took place last year when 14
shipments of imported Australian wheat was paid for by 10 tonnes of Iraqi
gold, suggests that the regime's resources of hard currency are low.

They said they were given the assurance by Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, foreign

resources. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said before the meeting
that it was concerned about Tuesday's statement and would oppose any

Relief agencies were alarmed by the statement because Somalia is still

FT  21 JAN 93 / Tokyo mounts silent rescue operation: Attempts to stem the
tide of non-bank debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND Japan's 21 top banks, which include household names like Mitsubishi
and Sanwa, lies a tangled financial undergrowth of 37,000 non-banks. The
often troubled relationship between the tightly regulated large banks and
the legions of loosely regulated non-banks is perhaps the main source of the
malaise afflicting the Japanese financial system.
Just as many of the difficulties of the US financial system began in
unknown, provincial savings and loan institutions so the gravest threat to
the Japanese financial system could come from the non-banks.
Japanese banks face mounting bad debts from real estate loans which turned
sour with the collapse of the bubble economy of the late 1980s.
The top 21 banks had non-performing loans of Y12,400bn (Pounds 63.6bn) at
the end of September, more than half the banks' equity base, according to
the Ministry of Finance.
Many of these bad debts are flowing in from the non-banks which the big
banks are linked to. The Bank of Tokyo announced it was restructuring one of
its non-bank affiliates. The Nippon Credit Bank, the long-term credit bank,
is grappling with huge problems at three of its non-bank affiliates.
Bank executives and officials at the Ministry of Finance are manning the
pumps in an attempt to stem the tide.
The non-banks lend money for house purchases, real estate development and
consumer credit. But they do not take in deposits from savers. They finance
themselves with borrowings from larger financial institutions and then lend
that money to their customers.
About 80 per cent of non-bank finance comes from other financial
institutions, mainly banks.
The non-banks were among the most active inflators of the bubble economy.
Non-bank lending more than trebled from Y31,000bn in 1987 to Y97,000bn in
March last year, the most recent figure available. That is twice the growth
rate of lending by national banks which rose from Y306,000bn to Y460,000bn
in the same period.
Non-bank lending surged because many of the banks used their non-bank
affiliates to escape the regulations imposed by the Finance Ministry.
The large banks are licensed by the ministry's commercial banks division.
Yet even though some non-banks such as the Orient Corporation and Orix are
listed companies they do not have to be licensed by the ministry.
The non-banks are just registered with local prefectural governments; many
have strong local political roots which they use to protect themselves
against interference from Tokyo.
The only legislation regulating the non-banks was passed in 1973 to protect
borrowers against loan sharks.
As a result the Finance Ministry finds it difficult to establish the extent
of the non-banks' bad debts, let alone bring them under control.
The ministry's first attempt two years ago to force the nonbanks to disclose
more information got virtually nowhere. It was only from last November that
parliament gave the ministry power to collect information about the
non-banks' lending.
The details of the non-banks' problems are still not publicly known. But the
general picture is alarming. The non-banks were heavily exposed to the steep
fall in the real estate market over the past three years, with land prices
in some urban areas down by as much as 60 per cent. The top 300 non-banks
account for 70 per cent of all non-bank loans, worth about Y66,000bn. About
40 per cent of those loans are to real estate developers and construction
companies, compared with 17 per cent for the banks. Another 30 per cent of
non-bank loans have real estate as their collateral.
About a year ago 100 of the top non-banks told the Finance Ministry that
more than a fifth of their loans were non-performing, with no interest paid
for more than a month.
Non-banks have loans worth about Y3,000bn to companies which went bankrupt
between the autumn of 1991 and last month, according to a report by the
research arm of Nippon Life Insurance, the country's largest life insurance
company.
The report estimates that 34 of the most troubled non-banks have bad loans,
mainly to property companies, worth about Y5,800bn.
Most of the bad loans which are building up in the non-banks will eventually
find their way back to the big banks. Mr David Snoddy, banking analyst at
Jardine Fleming, the securities house, estimates that about a quarter of the
Y58,000bn the banks have lent to the non-bank sector will turn into
non-performing loans. About 80 of the top 300 non-banks are either bank
subsidiaries or affiliated to banks.
In spite of the overwhelming problems no non-bank has yet gone bust. That is
because the Finance Ministry is orchestrating a hidden but extensive
bail-out by the big banks.
A Ministry of Finance official explained in typically coded terms: 'We have
advised the banks to take a great interest in the health of their
non-banks.' In plain language that means the banks have been told not to let
any non-banks fail.
The most obvious outward sign of the silent rescue operation is the
extraordinary growth in cheap loans to the non-banks. The NLI report
estimates that at least 33 top non-banks are receiving interest rate
reductions or exemptions from their main backers, on borrowings worth
Y6,600bn.
Cheap commercial bank loans, at an interest rate of 3.5 per cent or less,
several points below normal commercial rates, rose by 194 per cent in the
year to August. Most of these were to troubled non-banks.
Non-banks which stuck to consumer lending during the years of the bubble
economy and were not drawn into real estate lending are not in deep trouble.
Those that over-extended themselves during the bubble are rapidly beating a
retreat back to their core businesses of consumer credit, hire purchase
finance and housing loans.
However, restructuring the non-banks will take years rather than months. In
the 1980s the non-banks provided the big commercial banks with a convenient
back door route to expand their lending. In the 1990s the non-banks will be
a heavy drain on the top banks' resources. The hidden rescue operation of
the Japanese non-bank sector will take years to complete.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Inauguration of the President: Clinton enthusiasm invades US
public - George Graham finds support for the president in Pennsylvania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS and press pundits in Washington have already declared the
honeymoon over: President Bill Clinton stood accused of breaking promises
before he had laid a hand on the Bible at noon yesterday for his oath of
office.
Further afield, however, the Americans who voted him into the White House -
and a surprisingly large number of those who did not - are willing to give
the former governor of Arkansas more of a chance to prove himself.
Despite media criticism of his slowness at forming an administration, his
backtracking on promises to cut taxes for the middle class, and his policy
reversal on Haitian refugees, 71 per cent of voters hold a favourable
opinion of Mr Clinton, according to a poll conducted by Mr Ed Goeas and Ms
Celinda Lake, a Republican-Democratic polling partner ship.
In the rolling hills of southern Pennsylvania, generally Republican
territory, many seemed this week to agree with Mr Clinton's campaign slogan
that it was time for a change.
'I think the country needs a change. I just hope Clinton's the right guy,'
said Ms Elaine Wolf in the town of East Berlin.
Even those who are not sure they like his brand of change said they will
reserve judgment until he has had a chance to prove himself.
'I wish him well and I pray for him to that end, because there are certainly
a lot of things that need to be put right. I hope he can do it without
upsetting the apple cart,' said 69-year-old Mr Bob Slater, a Democrat for
much of his life but now with the Republicans. He runs a furniture shop in
the town of New Oxford.
Up the road at Gettysburg, where 130 years ago a Union army fought to a
standstill a southern invasion under the command of General Robert E. Lee,
Mrs Joan Baltzley went further and confessed she was enthusiastic about the
new president.
'I kind of hate to say this, because I didn't vote for him, but I do feel
enthusiastic. This is a good thing happening to our country - young blood
and new ideas,' she said.
Mr Clinton does not seem to have raised too many eyebrows by edging away
from some of his campaign pledges, but voters have low expectations of
politicians.
'No matter who would have gotten the position probably would have backed
down on some things,' said Ms Wolf.
It is the supporters of Mr Ross Perot, the unpredictable Texas billionaire
who reaped a strong anti-establishment vote in the presidential election,
who are the least forgiving of any frailties Mr Clinton may show.
'We will see how much of a man he is when he has to deal with Baghdad. He
has already broken his promises to the middle class,' said Mr Kevin Collins,
in Mechanicsburg.
For Mr Collins, Mr Clinton's lavish inaugural festivities, replete with
symbolism of his bonds to the American people, may have backfired. 'He's
spending Dollars 30m on this what do you call it, and I'm not even invited,'
he complained.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Inauguration of the President: Baton passes to practised
hands - US administration's foreign policy team shows continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH NOT as bitchy as academics, members of the foreign policy
establishment in the US - and elsewhere - can be pretty sniffy when an
outsider gets a position that really matters.
Even today, any recollection of the freelance thoughts and activities of Mr
Andrew Young, UN ambassador in the Carter administration of the 1970s,
produces pained expressions among them.
President Bill Clinton brings no credentials other than intellect to the
practice of US foreign policy. But the team now mostly assembled to run it
for him, under the aegis of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state,
should flutter few diplomatic dovecotes.
It is certainly not short of experience, even though the Democrats have been
out of power for 12 years. It has continuity in the retention of some senior
Bushmen, with Mr Edward Djerejian and Mr Dennis Ross remaining involved in
the Middle East and Mr Bernard Aronson temporarily keeping the Latin
American brief, mostly to deal with Haiti.
The team is well stuffed with career diplomats, including those held over,
even though some had moved out to the private sector. Mr Sam Lewis,
ambassador to Israel for eight years under Presidents Carter and Bush,
returns to run policy planning.
Mr Winston Lord, once an associate of Mr Henry Kissinger and who was
ambassador to Beijing until a few months before the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989, comes back to take control of Asian affairs. Mr George
Moose, another professional diplomat and former envoy to Senegal, gets the
African brief.
It has a quota of outsiders. Ever since he was passed over for a cabinet
post last month, Mr Tim Wirth, former senator from Colorado, has seemed a
likely recruit.
He is a man of eclectic interests and popular in Washington. His new role as
counsellor in charge of a fistful of global issues, ranging from the
environment to refugees, ought to test his talents.
Likewise, Mr Strobe Talbott, the Time magazine journalist and Oxford
classmate of Mr Clinton, has spent much of his career writing about the
former Soviet Union, including a book soon to be published. This knowledge
will be deployed in another new position as ambassador-at-large to the
former Soviet republics, with particular emphasis on Russia.
Mr Christopher has also placed those he knows particularly well in key
places - such as Mr Peter Tarnoff of the Council on Foreign Relations who,
as political under-secretary, is number three in the state department; Mr
Thomas Donilon, an associate with the secretary of state's law firm who
takes over public affairs; and Mr Stephen Oxman, now an investment banker
but aide to Mr Christopher in the Carter administration, who gets the
European portfolio.
There are, however, three areas of potential controversy. Mr Lord, a
Republican, has been very critical of China's post-Tiananmen policies. A
mid-summer test of the new administration's approach to China will occur
when Congress considers extension of most-favoured nation trading status. Mr
Lord might well propose that this be more conditional on acceptable Chinese
behaviour.
There appears to be a fair-sized battle going on over the succession to Mr
Aronson for Latin America. Favourite for the job was Mr Mario Baeza, a black
Cuban-American lawyer from New York and a close friend of Mr Vernon Jordan,
director of the administrative transition.
However, opposition to his appointment has come from Mr Jorge Mas Canosa,
leader of the Cuban community in Florida, who is reported to suspect Mr
Baeza would be more inclined to promote a dialogue with President Fidel
Castro of Cuba than work to overthrow him.
Last - but by no means least for Washington insiders - the absence of any of
the neo-conservative coterie influential in the foreign policy debate has
been widely noticed.
There remains the suspicion that most of the foreign policy ideas in the new
administration will come from the White House National Security Council
under Mr Anthony Lake and Mr Sandy Berger, with the State Department
providing the diplomatic process.
For all that, they all know each other well enough to avoid unnecessary
tensions.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Inauguration of the President: New president urges America
to embrace dramatic change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is the text of President Clinton's inaugural address:
Today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.
This ceremony is held in the depth of winter. But, by the words we speak and
the faces we show the world, we force the spring - a spring reborn in the
world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage to
reinvent America.
When our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world and
our purposes to the Almighty, they knew America, to endure, would have to
change - not change for change's sake, but to preserve America's ideals -
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Though we march to the music of our
time, our mission is timeless. Each generation must define what it means to
be an American.
On behalf of our nation I salute my predecessor for his half-century of
service to America, and thank the millions of men and women whose
steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and
communism.
Today a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new
responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened
still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.
Raised in unrivalled prosperity we inherit an economy still the world's
strongest, but weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing
inequality, and deep divisions among our people.
When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news
travelled slowly across the land on horseback and across the oceans by boat.
Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to
billions around the world. Communications and commerce are global;
investment is mobile; technology is almost magical; and ambition for a
better life is universal. We earn our livelihood in peaceful competition
with people all across the earth.
Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the
urgent question of our age is whether we can make change our friend and not
our enemy.
This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who
are able to compete and win in it. But, when most people are working harder
for less, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care
devastates millions and threatens to bankrupt many of our enterprises, when
fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom, and when millions
of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead -
we have not made change our friend.
We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps. But we have not
done so. Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our
resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence. Though our
challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have ever been a
restless, questing, hopeful people. We must bring to our task today the
vision and will of those who came before us.
From our revolution to the civil war, to the great depression to the civil
rights movement, our people have mustered the determination to construct
from these crises the pillars of our history.
Thomas Jefferson believed that, to preserve the very foundations of our
nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. My fellow-citizens,
this is our time. Let us embrace it.
Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our
own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by
what is right with America.
So, today, we pledge that the era of deadlock and drift is over - a new
season of American renewal has begun.
To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to
do before. We must invest more in our own people and in our own future, and
at the same time cut our massive debt. And we must do so in a world in which
we must compete for every opportunity.
It will not be easy; it will require sacrifice. But it can be done, and done
fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake. We
must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.
Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less.
Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what
posterity is. Posterity is the world to come - the world for whom we hold
our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear
sacred responsibility.
We must do what America does best: offer opportunity to all and demand
responsibility from all. It is time to break the bad habit of expecting
something for nothing, from our government or from each other. Let us take
more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our
communities and our country.
To renew America we must revitalise our democracy.
This beautiful capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilisation,
is a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful people manoeuvre for
position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and
who is down, forgetting the people whose toil and sweat sends them here and
pays their way.
Americans deserve better. In this city there are people who want to do
better. Let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and privilege
no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal
advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America.
Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt
called 'bold, persistent experimentation,' a government for our tomorrows,
not our yesterdays.
Let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs. To renew
America we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home. There is no clear
division today between what is foreign and what is domestic  - the world
economy, the world environment, the world Aids crisis, the world arms race
affect us all.
Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable.
Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers.
Clearly America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.
While America rebuilds at home we will not shrink from the challenges, nor
fail to seize the opportunities, of this new world. With our friends and
allies we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.
When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the
international community defied, we will act - with peaceful diplomacy when
possible, with force when necessary. The brave Americans serving our nation
in the gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand are testament to our
resolve.
But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in
many lands. Across the world we see them embraced - and we rejoice. Our
hopes, our hearts, and our hands are with those on every continent who are
building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause.
The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have
raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus. You have cast your votes in
historic numbers. And you have changed the face of the Congress, the
presidency, and the political process itself.
Yes, you have forced the spring. Now we must do the work the season demands.
To that work I now turn, with all the authority of my office. I ask the
Congress to join with me. But no president, no Congress, no government can
undertake this mission alone. My fellow-Americans, you, too, must play your
part in our renewal.
I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service - to
act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with
those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is much to be done -
enough for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of
themselves in service, too. In serving we recognise a simple but powerful
truth: We need each other. And we must care for one another.
Today we do more than celebrate America; we rededicate ourselves to the very
idea of America: An idea born in revolution and renewed through two
centuries of challenge; an idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for
fate, we - the fortunate and the unfortunate - might have been each other;
an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its diversity
the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that
America's long heroic journey must go forever upward.
And so, at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin with energy and hope,
with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done. The
scripture says: 'And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we
shall reap, if we faint not.'
From this joyful mountain-top of celebration we hear a call to service in
the valley.
We have heard the trumpets. We have changed the guard. And now - each in our
own way, and with God's help - we must answer the call.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Upheaval in prospect for the Canadian political landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WILL he stay or will he go? Whenever the talk in Canada turns to politics
these days, that question is asked of two of the country's most prominent
and long-serving leaders, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Quebec Premier
Robert Bourassa.
Depending on what they decide, their plans could radically alter Canada's
political landscape within the next two or three months.
Mr Mulroney's resignation would throw new uncertainty into the general
election, which will probably be called in late summer or early autumn.
Mr Bourassa's departure would re-ignite the issue of Quebec's place in
Canada just as it seemed to be dying down in the wake of the constitutional
referendum last September.
The shadows over the political future of the two men come from entirely
unrelated sources.
In Mr Mulroney's case, the pressure to step down is political. A strong body
of opinion, inside and outside the Progressive Conservative party, believes
that it would be better off entering the election campaign with a fresh face
at the helm.
Mr Mulroney, 53, who has been party leader for 10 years and prime minister
since the Tories took office in September 1984, has been unable to shake off
English-Canadians' visceral dislike of him. Although his government has
trodden cautiously over the past year or two, Mr Mulroney's reputation
remains dogged by the still-stagnant economy, by such policies as free trade
with the US, and by his own public image as a sanctimonious wheeler-dealer.
One recent opinion poll gave the Tories the support of only 18 per cent of
decided voters, compared with 44 per cent for the opposition Liberals. Mr
Mulroney is favoured as prime minister by fewer than one in seven voters.
Mr Mulroney and his aides are giving no clue to his intentions, leaving
political commentators to read their tea leaves. A cabinet shuffle this
month was interpreted by some as evidence that he was staying, by others
that he had decided to go.
The latter view has been boosted by a series of patronage appointments in
recent weeks, bringing back memories of the flood of jobs handed out by Mr
Pierre Trudeau in the dying days of his federal premiership nine years ago.
On the other hand, Mr Mulroney has chosen the very non-political chief of
Canada's armed forces, General John de Chastelain, for the plum post of the
ambassadorship in Washington.
The question mark over Mr Bourassa is his health. He disclosed this month
that the melanoma (skin cancer) first diagnosed in 1990 has spread to a
lung. He recently underwent surgery in the US and may begin experimental
cancer therapy next month.
Mr Bourassa, 59, has postponed a decision on his future at least until the
therapy starts. But that has not prevented Quebec's political temperature
rising in anticipation that, even if he stays on for the time being, he will
vacate the premiership this year.
With a provincial election due in 1994, Mr Bourassa's political friends and
foes, not to mention the media, have begun speculating on a possible
successor. The big question is whether one can be found who matches both his
popularity among voters and his shrewdness in holding together the
federalist and nationalist wings of the Quebec Liberal Party.
The only certainty about either Mr Mulroney's or Mr Bourassa's departure is
that it would create greater uncertainty in assessing the political outlook
for Canada.
Few doubt that Mr Mulroney's successor would bolster the Conservatives'
electoral chances in the nine English-speaking provinces - at least
initially. The current front-runner is Ms Kim Campbell, a bright Vancouver
lawyer whom Mr Mulroney recently shuffled from the justice ministry to the
defence portfolio.
As party leader, Ms Campbell or another westerner might have a good chance
of outflanking the Alberta-based Reform Party, which has drawn many unhappy
Conservatives on the prairies and the west coast with its populist,
right-wing platform.
Less sure, however, is whether another Tory leader could repeat Mr
Mulroney's success in the past two elections in his native Quebec. The
francophone province provides more than a quarter of the 295 members in the
federal parliament in Ottawa, and its voters tend to rally around a single
party at federal elections.
The Conservatives now hold 56 of Quebec's 75 seats. A good showing in the
francophone province is thus essential if the Conservatives are to have any
hope of forming a third majority government.
Although Ms Campbell is bilingual, she is virtually unknown in Quebec and
has no power base there. For the Conservatives to have any hope of doing
well there, a new leader from English Canada would need a strong Quebec
lieutenant. The name most often mentioned is that of Mr Jean Charest, the
up-and-coming but still lightweight environment minister.
The prospect of Quebec losing two of its most influential federalist voices
has already emboldened the province's separatists. Mr Lucien Bouchard, head
of the Bloc Quebecois, which has eight MPs in the House of Commons,
predicted this week that the number could rise to 60 at the next election.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Germany to outlaw insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is to outlaw insider dealing and introduce a central supervisory
body for the securities industry, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.
It is expected the amendment to the existing securities law could be in
place by the year-end.
Such a law and the creation of a supervisory body are regarded as essential
steps on the way to strengthening Germany as a financial centre.
These proposals were central to a policy document published last January by
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister. This outlined a package of measures
designed to enhance the German financial markets' competitive position.
It was originally intended that they would be in place by the end of 1992.
The lack of an insider law is particularly embarrassing for Germany as the
European Community directive on this issue should have been implemented by
member states by last summer.
The image of Frankfurt as a financial centre was tarnished after a series of
insider dealing scandals in 1991.
Frankfurt financiers dispute the seriousness of the scandals but accept the
need to make such dealing a criminal offence and to toughen the regulatory
environment.
The lack of a national supervisory body has made it difficult for Germany to
conduct negotiations with similar bodies from other countries, and so
hampered German companies and financial institutions.
Germany's Lander (state) governments are responsible for supervising the
securities markets in their respective territories.
Over the past year regional ministers have been meeting behind the scenes to
discuss details of the proposals.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday faced down hardliners who

Mr Kuchma confronted Conservative deputies objecting to price liberalisation
and a cap on wages at an informal session of parliament after his opponents
failed to achieve a quorum for an emergency debate.
Mr Kuchma's priorities are to cut the deficit by restricting industrial
subsidies and welfare payments, to solve Ukraine's energy crisis, to promote
private business and to create effective regional government.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Russia adopts a crisis plan to avert collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, MINSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday adopted an ambitious programme of financial
stabilisation and tight monetary policy in an effort to stave off financial
collapse.
The package was adopted after what Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime
minister in charge of the economy and finance, said was a 'heated'
discussion in a cabinet faced with bitter choices.
According to Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation, inflation is now running at 10 per cent a week - heading
rapidly for the level which marks the doleful entrance to hyperinflation;
production fell 20 per cent last year and has not yet stabilised;
unemployment is forecast to rise from well under 1m to more than 5m; the
budget deficit is variously put between 15 and 25 per cent of GNP; and
domestic and foreign investment has more than halved.
In the face of this Mr Fyodorov said that the plan adopted yesterday would
be aimed at bringing the budget deficit down to 5 per cent of GNP, and
inflation down to 5 per cent a month, by the end of this year.
To this end, interest rates, presently set by the central bank at 80 per
cent, would be raised to a level 'which would combat inflation'; enterprises
would have strict criteria to meet, in wage levels and productivity, before
qualifying for credits; the deficit would be financed in part by issuing
government bonds, with short-term denominations to protect against
inflationary losses; and budget deficit targets would be set quarterly.
At the same time, however, Mr Fyodorov said the government aimed to slow the
fall in production levels, double the interest paid on savings, and provide
better social protection for the population. Anticipating opposition from
the Russian Supreme Soviet, Mr Fyodorov said that some of the stringent
measures would be pushed through by presidential decree - while others would
be submitted for parliamentary approval.
At the same time an economics ministry official revealed that
inter-enterprise debt has soared to a level of Rbs3,500bn, surpassing the
crisis levels reached at the middle of last year before the central bank
advanced credit to bring the level down.
Mr Chubais said that Russia now had 46,000 private companies, and another
5,600 large enterprises had completed or were completing the process of
conversion.
The Belarus parliament yesterday passed a privatisation law, but proposed
legislation on use of land was delayed by continuing debate on the future of
collective farms, Reuter reports from Minsk.
The privatisation law was suspended last November after allegations of
illegal dealing. But many deputies said failure to approve the land bill
made a farce of the programme. The land bill ran into opposition from
farmers unwilling to relinquish control of state farms.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Currencies over
the worst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc, Danish krone and Irish punt - all weak recently in the
European exchange rate mechanism - seem to have surmounted the worst of the
currency storms. Partly reflecting the D-Mark's decline against the dollar,
the three currencies have recovered from their lows. Although the French
franc, in particular, could be a hostage to political tensions in the run-up
to the March parliamentary elections, immediate pressure for another ERM
realignment has diminished. However, all three countries, suffering from
very high real interest rates and facing poor growth prospects, are counting
the costs of standing up to speculative pressures. FT writers assess the
cost of staying the ERM course.

<TEXT>
ALL THREE currencies - the French franc, Irish punt and Danish krone - are
now under much less pressure inside the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) than
they were two weeks ago, writes James Blitz in London.
The French franc closed last night at FFr3.3800 against the D-Mark, some 5
pfennigs above its ERM floor. Earlier in the day, it had been at FFr3.3770,
its highest level since November 19 last year.
The Irish punt was also stronger, less than a fortnight after it had been
trading below its ERM floor of 2.95100 against the Dutch guilder. At the end
of European trading yesterday, the punt was seen as high as 2.9805.
The Danish krone has also strengthened. The krone was yesterday trading well
away from its ERM floor of DKr3.901 to the D-Mark, at DKr3.8373.
French money market rates have risen all this week, in spite of the stronger
currency, with 3-month french francs rising yesterday to 11 15/16 per cent
from a previous close of 11 3/4 per cent.
In Dublin, the overnight lending rate for the punt is well down from the 100
per cent seen in the first week of this year.
But the cost of borrowing punts for 11 months was at around 17 per cent last
night.
Earlier this week, Denmark's central bank cut its key lending rate by 1
percentage point, to 12 per cent.
However, 3-month krone were still trading nearly 500 basis points above
3-month D-Marks yesterday.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Danish minister angers Greek MEPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, outgoing Danish foreign minister, yesterday
provoked uproar in the European parliament when he called on Greece to stop
blocking EC efforts to reach agreement on recognition of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia.
Greek MEPs denounced Mr Ellemann-Jensen's statement as a 'moral and ethical
disgrace' and said he had cast a slur on the Greek nation. The stormy
reaction threatened to bring to a head the simmering dispute within the
Community on how to resolve the Macedonia question.
In Athens, the Greek government called an emergency cabinet meeting and
asked the next EC Council of Ministers to consider censuring Mr
Ellemann-Jensen for 'unacceptable' conduct before the parliament.
But Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who will stand down after 10 years as Denmark's
foreign minister when a new government forms in Copenhagen, remained
unrepentant.
It was time to 'wash out the wound' of Macedonia by supporting moves in the
UN Security Council to give Macedonia a seat in the UN General Assembly, he
said. The Community was 'growing weary' of the Greek government's
obstructions.
'Greece feels threatened by Macedonia despite being in the EC and Nato. I
feel this is unacceptable because it shows a lack of trust in these
organisations,' he said.
The EC has tried for more than a year to reach a common position on
recognition, but Greece has resisted on the grounds that it could provoke
territorial claims on its northern province of Macedonia.
Denmark, which took over the rotating presidency of the European Community
in the New Year, has pressed for recognition so that much-needed
humanitarian and financial aid can reach the republic which is caught
between hostile neighbours, Serbia and Greece.
The fracas over Macedonia overshadowed the parliament's debate on Yugoslavia
and news of the Bosnian-Serbs agreement to the Vance-Owen peace plan.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen and Mr Hans van den Broek, the new EC commissioner for
external affairs, both warned that the next step must be to enforce the
peace plan's provisions.
If the parties in former Yugoslavia failed to abide, further pressure would
be forthcoming, including the total diplomatic and economic isolation of
Serbia and possible military action.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: 'Franc fort'
squeezes jobs, growth and prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<TEXT>
THE cost to France of its franc fort policy has been, above all, a more
sluggish economy.
Higher short-term interest rates have slowed growth. Fewer tax receipts and
higher social charges have enlarged the budget deficit, likely to be far
above the FFr185bn (Pounds 22.5bn) target for this year. Bankruptcies are
running at around 4,000 a month and are highest in the building and retail
trades.
Bank margins have been squeezed every time short-term rates have risen,
though the worst was in September when keeping their own lending rates down
cost the banks FFr400m, according to the French Association of Banks.
Central bank support for the franc has been on a big scale at times, with
FFr160bn spent to prop it up in September alone.
Sporadic speculation against the franc since November had led to
intervention 'at a level a little lower than in September', Mr Michel Sapin,
the finance minister, said this week.
It is not clear that the French central bank has lost anything on these
operations, since the currency rates have stayed unchanged; indeed it
claimed to have stung speculators in September and made a profit itself.
By far the steepest cost has been in unemployment, now at 10.4 per cent,
with nearly 3m out of work. It is unclear whether the exchange rate is to
blame for all of the record 600,000 lay-offs in industry last year.
Indeed, part of the cause may be a change in management behaviour, with
employers far quicker than they used to be to try to reduce their share of
France's high social payroll charges and to replace labour with capital.
On this score, the employers' federation, Patronat, has come under fire from
both left and right. Yesterday, Mr Francois Perigot, Patronat president, hit
back: 'When we have an economic situation as disastrous as that in France,
there is no other alternative but to reduce staff.'
But things are 'returning to normal in terms of the exchange rate, interest
rates and the Banque de France's reserves', Mr Sapin claimed this week.
Though the franc is again trading comfortably within its EMS range against
the D-Mark, overnight money market rates are still over 12 per cent, though
they have been as high as 20 per cent. By contrast, long-term French rates,
the benchmark for investment rather than speculation, are at less than 8 per
cent and have scarcely moved throughout the crises.
A majority of French people, 72 per cent, believe in a strong franc and
oppose any devaluation against the D-Mark, according to a Sofres poll for
the Finance Ministry.
The one clear benefit of the franc fort policy has been squeezing inflation
to a 36-year annual low of 2 per cent. This has spurred French companies
into cutting costs and improving quality in a way that has paid off in
export markets. As a result, the strong exchange rate has coincided with
France's strongest trade performance for two decades. A FFr30bn deficit in
1991 was turned into a FFr24bn surplus for the first 11 months of last year.
However, this is waning. November showed only a FFr400m surplus and December
is expected to show no more than a balance. But the decline seems to be more
related to slackening demand for exports in key trading partner countries,
such as Germany, than to an over-valued exchange rate. So far, French
traders have not really felt challenged by the cheaper pound, lira and
peseta.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK yesterday presented the European Parliament with ambitious plans for
its six-month presidency of the EC, which it said would be unaffected by the
impending change of government in Copenhagen.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, outgoing Danish foreign minister, said there was a
broad consensus among the principal Danish political parties on EC policy.
'There is no need to worry whether the Danish presidency will function,' he
said.
But Mr Leo Tindemans, a Belgian former prime minister and now president of
the Christian Democratic group in the parliament, noted that a Danish
government was not yet in place in Copenhagen. 'Never in my experience has a
presidency started under worst auspices than today,' he told fellow MEPs.
Denmark's goals for its presidency include opening negotiations on EC
enlargement with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and - as soon as possible -
Norway; greater openness in EC decision-making; devolving responsibilities
to the lowest level in the Community according to the principle of
subsidiarity; tougher EC environmental policy; and closer political and
economic ties with eastern and central Europe.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen, one of Europe's longest-serving foreign ministers, told
reporters at a farewell news conference that his speech had been cleared by
the main parties in the Danish parliament. In Denmark, Mr Poul Nyrop
Rasmussen, the Social Democratic leader, is trying to form an SDP-led
government after 10 years of Conservative-Liberal rule, but a new coalition
may not be in place until the weekend.
In his speech to the European Parliament, Mr Ellemann-Jensen said the
conflict in Yugoslavia would demand the greatest efforts of the Danish
presidency.
He also called for closer co-operation with the incoming Clinton
administration in the US to promote economic growth, reach a Gatt trade
agreement, strengthen the UN's peace-keeping role and create an
International Court of Criminal Justice.
Denmark - which rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last June -
is to hold a second such poll in late-April or early-May.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Italian bankers act on Efim debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian bankers association (ABI) is to set up a legal panel to consider
ways of ensuring repayment of debts owed by Efim, the state industrial
holding placed in liquidation last July.
Italian and foreign banks are due L9,500bn (Pounds 4.51bn), the largest
accumulation of debt owed to banks as a result of the collapse of any
Italian group.
Despite repeated government attempts to spell out the details of payment to
creditors, both domestic and foreign bankers remain confused and are
increasingly impatient.
Yesterday's decision empowers Mr Tancredi Bianchi, president of the ABI, to
nominate a panel of three to four lawyers headed by Mr Piero Schlesinger, a
prominent jurist and president of Banca Popolare di Milano.
Within a month the panel would be expected to be in a position to provide
advice on the best approaches to recover credits.
Mr Bianchi is also seeking a meeting with Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime
minister, to obtain reassurances. Italian banks are owed almost 60 per cent
of Efim's debt.
This week the government confirmed it had raised the ceiling from L4,000bn
to L9,000bn for bonds to be issued to cover debt. Mr Alberto Predieri, the
liquidator, had earlier sought a L10,000bn ceiling.
Mr Bianchi said yesterday it was essential to clarify the procedures for
paying off the bank credits.
He also voiced his concern over the lack of clarity in the government's
recent decision to separate Efim's defence and aerospace activities and
place them on a lease basis with Finmeccanica, the main industrial
subsidiary of IRI, the state holding.
He said the destination of the cash flow from these leased companies needed
to clarified - would it be used by Finmeccanica, used to repay debts or
accumulated to attract future purchasers?

FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Resilient krone
sees off the speculators
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE upheavals in the EMS have left Denmark with high short-term interest
rates and an abrupt loss of competitiveness in important export markets.
But, in spite of a prospective change of government, Denmark appears to have
weathered the crisis - and the central bank is proclaiming victory.
'Defence of the krone has not cost us a thing. It has cost the speculators,
who have lost,' said Mrs Kirsten Mordhorst, vice-president of the Danish
National Bank.
The UK, Sweden, Finland, Norway and the southern European countries - all of
whose currencies have fallen in the past few months - together account for
about a third of Denmark's exports.
But this has not yet dented Denmark's current account surplus, about DKr25bn
(Pounds 2.6bn) last year, or 3 per cent of GDP. Furthermore, the domestic
political turbulence which erupted last week with the resignation of the
prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, has had a positive impact on financial
markets. The krone has strengthened against the D-Mark, the one-month
Copenhagen interbank offer rate has fallen by more than 2 percentage points
to 15, the all-share index fell 4.7 points in two days, but bond prices have
risen.
Firmness on financial markets in part reflects the view that the new Social
Democratic government, expected to be installed later this week, will be in
a better position than Mr Schluter's administration to secure a Yes to the
Maastricht treaty when it is submitted to a second referendum this spring.
In spite of only sluggish Danish economic growth, the markets are also
impressed by inflation of only 1.4 per cent for the latest 12 month-period.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the national bank governor, now says that in all
important respects Denmark's economy is more stable than Germany's.
Short-term interest rates have nevertheless been high for long periods. Some
companies have been paying loan rates of up to 20 per cent. According to Mr
Michael Teit Nielsen, economist at the Federation of Small Enterprises, this
is creating a vicious circle. 'As equity capital is eroded the banks are
less and less willing to lend money,' he said
Despite the national bank's optimistic view, Denmark is as eager as any
other EC country to see the Bundesbank making significant cuts in interest
rates.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Battle for punt
leaves long list of casualties
</HEADLINE>

   By TIM COONE

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THROUGH good days and bad days with the Irish pound, this was one of the
most satisfying.' Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, had reason to
enjoy the statement by EC finance ministers who on Monday strongly supported
the Irish government's four-month battle to defend the punt against
devaluation.
But has it been a Pyrrhic victory as some analysts now say? The cost has
been considerable and forecasts for the Irish economy in 1993 are the
gloomiest in years.
In defending the punt after sterling's abandonment of the ERM last
September, the government exhausted its entire stock of reserves worth
IPounds 3bn in August. It has borrowed abroad to rebuild them to around
IPounds 2bn now, abandoning its policy of capping foreign currency debt at
IPounds 9bn before the crisis.
Foreign holders of Irish gilts, mostly German financial institutions, sold
IPounds 1.8bn of a stock of IPounds 4bn held by them before September. Their
appetite for new purchases will depend on prospects for the economy, which
are not promising.
Irish commercial and mortgage interest rates were pushed up by three
percentage points last October, as the central bank raised its own lending
rates to defend the punt. Personal overdrafts now carry interest rates of
around 19 per cent, commercial loans are around 16 per cent, while mortgage
rates are 14 per cent. Inflation was only 3 per cent last year, and is now
expected to fall to only 1.5 per cent this year. 'The monetary squeeze
facing Ireland is now greater than in the UK at the height of its monetary
squeeze before its abandonment of the ERM,' says Mr Chris Johns, chief
economist at the Bank of Ireland.
This week, interbank interest rates for one-month money were below 20 per
cent, having reached 100 per cent a fortnight ago. The threat of a further 3
percentage point rise in commercial rates has thus receded, but
paradoxically, the strengthening of the punt against the D-Mark and sterling
has thrown the focus back on the exchange rate problem. Since September the
punt has been revalued against sterling by around 14 per cent, and has
placed severe pressures on Irish industry. The heads of prominent exporting
companies have recently started to call openly for devaluation.
On a trade-weighted index, bringing in the currencies of Ireland's main
trading partners, the punt has been revalued by around 4 per cent since
September.
For an open economy such as Ireland's, heavily dependent on trade, this has
worrying implications. Mr Tom Jago, president of the Irish Business and
Employers' Confederation, said last week that their latest statistics show
'a very depressing downturn in order books, investment plans and employment
expectations'. The Dublin-based NCB stockbrokers noted: 'The short-term
impact of a successful defence of the currency would, on balance, add to
deflationary pressures already in train and we would expect growth in real
GDP to be no better than 0.5 per cent in 1993.'
Davy stockbrokers are issuing a profits warning for Irish corporations this
year and predict that even if German interest rates fall, Irish rates are
unlikely to fall significantly before the end of 1993.
This all creates a dilemma for the new coalition Fianna Fail-Labour
government which has committed itself to attacking lengthening dole queues
as its priority. It faces some tough budget decisions next month, and its
commitment to keep borrowing down to within 3 per cent of GDP leaves little
space for manoeuvre.
With no policy changes, the government itself predicts a rise in
unemployment of 34,000 this year from its present 290,000. Independent
analysts believe the increase is likely to go as high as 50,000, rising to
19 per cent of the workforce from 16.6 per cent, already the highest in the
EC.
Was it all worth it? 'Certainly,' the government argues. It says the
benefits of having credibility within the ERM and low inflation, enhances
competitiveness and puts Ireland in the fast track to European Monetary
Union. This is the strategic goal. Once achieved, the argument goes, Ireland
can finally shed the perception that its economic fortunes are forever
hostage to those of the UK - a perception which precipitated the last
assault on the punt.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Pound slips as sales fall hits hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that consumers would help to lead the economy out of recession
received a setback yesterday when it emerged that brisk Christmas activity
failed to lift overall retail sales last month.
The news sent the pound sharply lower against the D-Mark as investors
weighed the possibility that the latest figures might encourage the
government to cut interest rates. Sterling closed 2 pfennigs lower in London
at DM2.4750, while in New York it finished at DM2.4760.
Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed a 0.7
per cent drop in the volume of shop sales in December compared with
November, disappointing expectations for a small rise.
A survey from the London Chamber of Commerce out today is likely to add to
gloom about the economy with its message that there are no signs of recovery
in the capital.
The CSO figures showed that, although sales fell on the month, they were 1.2
per cent higher in December on a year-on-year basis. This followed only a
marginal annual rise in November.
The data underlined the disappointing results of a Confederation of British
Industry survey published earlier this week which also showed a drop in the
volume of December sales.
But analysts warned against reading too much into a month's figures,
particularly in December when seasonal adjustment is more open to error
because of the effect of Christmas.
In the three months to the end of December, sales rose by 0.3 per cent
compared with the previous three months and were 1.3 per cent higher than in
the fourth quarter of 1991.
The month-on-month drop contradicted other evidence - including strong
growth in the narrow money supply and higher car registrations - that
spending increased at the end of 1992.
A breakdown of the figures shows that food and mixed-retail sales held up
relatively well. The sharpest fall was for 'other non-food' retailers, such
as newsagents, off-licences, chemists, bookshops, florists and sports shops.
Sales fell by 4 per cent in the latest quarter and were 7 per cent lower
than a year ago.
Clothing and footwear sales volumes were flat on the month and down 1 per
cent on the quarter. Household goods sales fell slightly compared with
November but rose by 1 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the
previous three months.
Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium,
said the stronger sales of late December had continued into the new year,
influenced by heavy price discounts.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said retail sales
remained on an upward trend. 'We must not let one month's figures mask all
the encouraging signs of activity in the economy,' he said.

FT  21 JAN 93 / France criticises US cruise missile attack on Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE complained yesterday that the US had exceeded its United Nations
mandate on Sunday when it launched cruise missiles against an industrial
complex south of Baghdad.
The first serious rift between the western Gulf war allies emerged as US
aircraft flew routine patrols over the northern and southern air exclusion
zones of Iraq in the wake of President Saddam Hussein's offer of a ceasefire
to mark the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.
UN weapons inspectors waiting in Bahrain for more than two weeks are due to
leave today for Baghdad. Iraq had refused to allow the UN team to return,
then put conditions on flight plans which the UN said were unacceptable.
Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, yesterday briefed the French
cabinet in frank terms. He spelt out 'the reasons for France's
non-participation in the military action on the Baghdad suburbs, considering
that it exceeded Security Council resolutions', the government spokesman
said.
France only made its displeasure public on the day that Mr George Bush left
office. It evidently did not want to offend a US president with whom it has
generally got on well. Many in Paris however felt that US relations with
Iraq had turned into a personal vendetta with President Saddam. France said
it hoped that a new president in the White House would 'open a new phase' in
relations with Iraq.
As the March elections in France draw nearer, the Socialist government may
also wish to dispel any impression given by participation in two allied
raids against Iraq that it was slavishly following America's lead.
In London, Mr John Major, the prime minister, called the bombardment wholly
justified. He rejected French criticism and said France was consulted
beforehand: 'This was a raid made by the US rather than the allies because
they had the equipment in site to do it,' Mr Major told reporters in Downing
Street.
Mr Bush urged governments around the world to support efforts to oust Mr
Saddam, and the outgoing president's top security aide admitted that
Washington had backed coup attempts against the Iraqi leader.
In a five-page report to Congress released only hours before Mr Clinton took
over, Mr Bush said Mr Saddam continued to defy terms of the 1991 Gulf war
ceasefire. He urged leaders to support opposition groups trying to topple
the Iraqi leader.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, Mr Bush's national security adviser, admitted in an
interview published yesterday that the administration had backed coup
attempts against Mr Saddam and came 'pretty close' to succeeding.

FT  21 JAN 93 / BA board considers strategy over 'dirty tricks' affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Airways board will meet this morning to consider urgent steps to
restore the company's battered image and to discuss the conclusions of an
internal inquiry into its 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic.
Some BA directors met last night to prepare for the special full board
meeting which is seen as critical in BA's effort to prevent the affair
escalating.
It also emerged yesterday that the European Commission is understood to be
interested in examining whether BA may have abused its dominant market
position.
The Commission confirmed yesterday that it had received a complaint from
Virgin about alleged abuse of BA's dominant position in the allocation of
take-off and landing 'slots' at London's Heathrow airport.
Despite mounting criticism of BA's discredited campaign and its subsequent
handling of the affair, the airline does not appear poised to make sweeping
changes in its top management.
Big investors and employees are demanding action by the company. But calls
for the resignation of either Lord King, the airline's chairman, or Sir
Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, have been dismissed by board members.
Sir Michael Angus, a non-executive deputy chairman of BA and president of
the Confederation of British Industry, said last night: 'Nobody is seeking
the resignation of either Lord King or of Sir Colin.' Although Sir Michael
has been tipped as a possible interim chairman when Lord King steps aside in
the summer, he said he had not been asked to take on the role. He added:
'Everything is feasible in an emergency, but I don't think it will occur.'
The question of splitting the responsibilities of chairman and chief
executive - both of which have been expected to go to Sir Colin - is not
believed to be regarded as an urgent issue. The board will, however, be
giving immediate attention to an 80-page report into the airline's efforts
to undermine Virgin by Linklaters &amp; Paines, BA's solicitors.
The document is understood to lend weight to the airline's repeated claims
that the covert campaign was confined to a limited number of employees and
did not reach into the highest levels of the company.
The report, however, damns aspects of the airline's anti-Virgin operations
and some directors already appear to accept that those responsible should be
dismissed. Legal, public relations and marketing personnel are thought to be
most at risk.
It is also likely, as part of its damage-limitation exercise, that the board
will consider establishing a compliance committee to enforce a code of
conduct within the company to ensure BA does not become embroiled in such a
highly damaging affair again.
BA's board hopes to end the highly embarrassing episode by the end of this
week.
While BA pursues internal action, it is maintaining a high-level dialogue
with Mr Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, in an attempt to prevent
further legal action against it.
BA has sent a second, confidential note to Mr Branson asking him to spell
out the circumstances in which he would bury the hatchet.
Virgin's head has threatened to sue BA in the US on anti-trust grounds, a
move which could undermine its efforts to take a stake in USAir, the
sixth-largest US carrier.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Clinton pledges era of renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT William Jefferson Clinton yesterday summoned his country to join
him in 'a new season of American renewal'.
Sworn in as 42nd president at noon on a brilliant sunny day before tens of
thousands of the highest and lowest of his fellow citizens, the 46-year-old
former governor of Arkansas promised in a 14-minute inaugural address 'that
the era of deadlock and drift is over'.
'There is,' he proclaimed, 'nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured
by what is right with America'. But 'it will not be easy, it will require
sacrifice', he said, echoing themes so frequently invoked in his long run
for the presidency.
He admonished Washington ('this beautiful capital') for being consumed by
'who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down'. Americans 'deserve
better and in this city there are people who want to do better. Let us
resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout
down the voice of the people'.
It was an address aimed at his domestic audience, as is customary, but he
pledged to meet all external challenges because 'there is no clear division
today between what is foreign and what is domestic - the world economy, the
world environment, the world Aids crisis, the world arms race affect us
all'.
He said that 'together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape
change, lest it engulfs us all'. But, 'when our vital interests are
challenged or the will and conscience of the international community defied,
we will act - with peaceful diplomacy when possible, with force when
necessary'.
As is also traditional, the new president thanked his predecessor, 'for his
half century of service to America'. Mr George Bush, who had met the
Clintons in the White House and escorted them to the Capitol, rose and
acknowledged the applause, which also broke out several times in the middle
of the address when Mr Clinton hit a rhythmic stride as he spoke of his 'new
season of renewal'.
If the speech lacked memorable lines, its message was clear. It was also
brief - as is not always Mr Clinton's wont. His aides said only George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln, no mean role models, had given shorter
inaugural addresses.
But mostly this was a day of pageantry, given an especially Clintonian
flavour. He began it not by jogging but by attending a service at the
African Methodist Episcopal church, marked by glorious gospel singing.
His touch was evident in the ceremonies themselves, with Marilyn Horne from
the Metropolitan Opera singing a medley of traditional songs and Maya
Angelou reading a powerful poem, 'On The Pulse Of The Morning', specially
composed for the occasion.
He took his oath from the Supreme Court's chief justice, Mr William
Rehnquist, with his left hand on a bible given to him by his grandmother,
open at the passage from St Paul's epistle to the Galatians, which
concludes: 'He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
everlasting life'.
In the afternoon, hand in hand with his wife Hillary, the new president
walked the last few hundred yards to a reviewing stand outside the White
House to watch the vast inaugural parade.
When it was all over, he took Mr Bush to a helicopter to begin his journey
back to Texas and a new life as a private citizen.
The world outside, including Iraq, did not intrude on the day. Yesterday,
the Senate confirmed in their appointments the new secretaries of state,
treasury and defence - Mr Warren Christopher, Mr Lloyd Bentsen and Mr Les
Aspin respectively. Business as usual resumes today.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm second half boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Eurotherm, the temperature control and drives company, more than
doubled last year helped by cost cutting and improved margins.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 14.6m in the year to
October 31 last. At the interim stage, profits were 46 per cent ahead at
Pounds 6.7m.
Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said it was a 'year of reconstruction' after the
company misjudged the depth of recession and had to attack its cost base.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 2.4m were taken in the previous year, with a
further Pounds 500,000 charged as an administrative expense this time. In
the last two years employees have fallen by nearly one-third to just over
2,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 157.7m to Pounds 154.6m following the disposal
half way through the year of two unprofitable subsidiaries which had annual
sales of about Pounds 8m. Mr Leonard said Eurotherm's maintained levels of
sales in shrinking international markets suggested the company had improved
market share.
Eurotherm continued to generate cash, despite an increase in capital
expenditure from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6.3m. Net borrowings fell from Pounds
15.6m to Pounds 7.4m while gearing dropped from 30 per cent to 12.9 per
cent.
Earnings increased from 10.6p to 22.3p. The directors proposed a final
dividend of 5p (4.7p) to make a total of 8p (7.2p), an increase of 11 per
cent.
COMMENT
These results were well received, even through the scale of recovery is
flattered by comparison with a poor 1991. With the benefits of restructuring
largely on board, Eurotherm appears close to recovering historical levels of
profitability. Gross margins have improved by 3 percentage points to 48 per
cent, and should rise beyond 50 per cent in the medium term. Meanwhile, this
year's profits are partly underwritten by currency factors since, with 70
per cent of sales overseas, average sterling exchange rates are likely to be
beneficial. However, all this good news is already in the price, especially
after yesterday's 24p rise to 495p. The shares have now risen more than 20
per cent since the start of December. Forecast profits this year of Pounds
18m put them on a prospective p/e of more than 18. Amid a sector long on
recovery plays, Eurotherm is starting to look expensive.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: US banks' recovery trend
continues - Chase Manhattan advances 23% over year in wake of staff cuts

<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY trend among big US banks was underscored by improved
fourth-quarter and full-year 1992 results from Chase Manhattan and Chemical
Banking in New York, Banc One in Ohio and Wells Fargo in California.
Net profits at Chase Manhattan, the New York bank that has been cutting
staff and restructuring operations, were 23 per cent higher at Dollars 639m,
or Dollars 3.46 per share, for the whole of 1992.
The earnings were up despite bad debt provisions that rose to Dollars 1.22bn
for the year from Dollars 1.09bn in 1991.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 169m, or 87 cents, against Dollars
135m, or 80 cents, last time. Provisions for the quarter were Dollars 305m,
down from Dollars 315m a year earlier.
Net loan write-offs for 1992 were Dollars 1.27bn, against Dollars 1.93bn in
the previous year, while write-offs on US commercial property loans were
Dollars 453m, compared with Dollars 377m last time.
Chase said it reduced its commercial property loan exposure in the US to
Dollars 6.7bn in 1992 - from Dollars 8.6bn at the end of 1991.
The bank's earnings last year were helped by net interest revenues of
Dollars 3.6bn, up from Dollars 3.4bn in 1991.
Chase's common equity-to-assets ratio was 5.25 per cent at year-end, up from
4.36 per cent a year earlier. The return on assets was 0.64 per cent,
against 0.52 per cent in 1991.
Chemical Banking had its first full year of operations since the merger of
Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. It achieved fourth-quarter net
income of Dollars 304m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with a Dollars
420m (Dollars 2.49 a share) loss in the same quarter of 1991, or up by 48
per cent when compared to the 1991 quarter's profit before merger-related
restructuring charges.
For the whole of 1992, Chemical's net profit was a healthy Dollars 1.086bn,
or Dollars 3.90, against Dollars 154m, or 11 cents, in 1991 after
restructuring charges and 39 per cent higher with the 1991 charge stripped
out.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the strong earnings 'clearly validate
the merger'.
Chemical's bad debt provisions in 1992 were Dollars 1.365bn, little changed
from Dollars 1.345bn in 1991. Total loan write-offs, excluding
less-developed countries' debt, were Dollars 1.365bn, against Dollars
1.191bn in 1991.
The bank's common equity-to-assets capital ratio was 5.7 per cent at
year-end, up from 4.1 per cent in the previous year. The tier one measure
used by regulators was 7.2 per cent, up sharply from 5.1 per cent at the end
of 1991.
In Ohio, the Banc One Corporation showed it was able to turn in solid
profits even as it continued to make acquisitions. The fourth-quarter 1992
net profit was Dollars 193.1m, or 81 cents, up by 27.7 per cent from Dollars
151.2m, or 65 cents.
Bad debt provisions were Dollars 114.3m in the quarter, down from Dollars
171.9m in the same period of 1991. The provisions level was slightly higher
for the year, at Dollars 510.5m, against Dollars 502.7m. For the whole of
1992 Banc One had Dollars 781.3m, or Dollars 3.28 per share, of net profits,
a rise of 32 per cent on the 1991 net.
Banc One's 1.34 per cent return on assets in 1992 was nearly twice the
industry average and its common equity-to-assets ratio of 8.1 per cent made
it one of the best capitalised banks in the US.
Wells Fargo, the California bank that has been hit by commercial property
loan problems, had net profits of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 4.44 per share,
in 1992, against Dollars 21m, or 4 cents, in 1991.
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 58m, or 83 cents,
compared with a Dollars 231m (Dollars 4.59 a share) loss in the same period
of 1991.
The bank's bad debt provision in the last quarter was Dollars 300m, down
from Dollars 700m a year before.
At the close on Wall Street, Chemical's share price was Dollars  3/8 higher
at Dollars 41 5/8 ; Chase was Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 29 5/8 ; Banc
One was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 52 1/4 ; Wells Fargo was Dollars 13
higher at Dollars 99.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were 'high bidders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr CLIVE LEACH, group chief executive of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television,
admitted yesterday that the group had been 'high bidders' for its ITV
franchise.
'I put my hands up,' he said. 'We have got to do something about it,' he
said after the group announced pre-tax profits up 23 per cent to Pounds
16.12m (Pounds 13.09m) for the year to September.
But interest yesterday was less in the 1991-92 results, than in what happens
now that the merged company must pay Pounds 52.76m a year to the Treasury.
This is the sum it bid to secure the new franchise plus 5.5 per cent of net
advertising revenue - a low percentage for a company of its size.
The Exchequer levy was low in its final year. A total of Pounds 6.37m was
paid to the government by Yorkshire, including a proportion of Tyne-Tees'
dues.
'It's going to be tough,' conceded Mr Leach. But 'like Mark Twain, rumours
of our death have been much exaggerated.'
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would be in profit from year one, albeit it at a lower
level.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, believes the company will
make Pounds 10.5m pre-tax this year, but that the figure will drop again to
Pounds 7m in 1993-94 when Yorkshire will have its first 12-month financial
year under the new franchise regime.
Yorkshire has been putting considerable emphasis on cost-cutting -
reductions are already running at Pounds 11m in a full year - and on savings
resulting from the merger, such as shared transmission and advertising sales
effort.
Permanent staff would have come down from 1,257 in 1992 to 935 in March this
year. 'As we progress throughout the year there will be opportunities to
improve our working practices which means looking at the numbers we employ,'
Mr Leach said.
Although Pounds 1.1m was paid as a staff bonus in September there would be a
general salary freeze this year.
Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake of
just under 20 per cent, is forecasting that it will increase its share of
ITV revenue from about 11.8 per cent to 12.2 per cent.
Net cash balances increased from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 23.1m. 'We are very
comfortable,' Mr Leach insisted.
Earnings per share increased to 27.1p (22.9p). The final dividend was held
at 8.7p, making a same-again total of 12p.
The share price gained 8p to close at 144p.

FT  20 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) YSL and Elf-Sanofi form world's third-biggest
beauty group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 21st January 1993) appended to this article.
ELF-SANOFI, the French drug and perfume company, is to absorb Yves Saint
Laurent, one of the most famous names in Paris fashion, to create the
world's third-biggest beauty products company.
The deal, based on a share exchange of four of Sanofi's shares for every one
YSL share, was announced yesterday. Trading in the two companies' shares is
to resume today. Before it was suspended on Monday, Elf-Sanofi's shares were
FFr1,100 and YSL shares were FFr630.
The merger provides a way out for YSL's two controlling partners - the
fashion designer of the same name and his long-time friend and co-founder,
Mr Pierre Berge - of a financial squeeze that had left them shouldering
increased debt with sharply reduced profits.
Mr Berge, who will keep management control of the fashion side of YSL but
lose that of the perfume side of the business, said he had long been
concerned about the company's long-term future. This was now assured, he
said, with Sanofi as a partner.
Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, Elf-Sanofi's president, said the merger was a great
opportunity to add an illustrious name to its list of perfume brands - Oscar
de la Renta, Roger &amp; Gallet, Stendhal and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.
Elf-Sanofi, whose total turnover of around FFr19bn (Pounds 2.25bn) is about
six times that of YSL, is principally interested in acquiring 'image, rather
than cash flow', according to one executive.
Mr Dehecq yesterday forecast that Elf-Sanofi's net profits in 1992 will
'comfortably top' FFr1bn, up from FFr956m in 1991. This contrasts with the
plunge in YSL profits last year to FFr2.6m in the first six months compared
with FFr41m in the same period of the previous year.
At present, Mr Yves Saint Laurent and Mr Berge control more than 40 per cent
of YSL. This partnership will be wound up and YSL's two founders will have
8.1 per cent of the new YSL group.
Elf-Acquitaine, the state-owned oil company which controls Elf-Sanofi, is
not subscribing to this share issue, and so will see its stake in its
subsidiary drop from 61 per cent to 51.5 per cent.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf-Acquitaine's president, said he was pleased to
see Elf-Sanofi diversify at no cost to the parent company.
CORRECTION
THE terms of the merger between Yves Saint Laurent and Elf-Sanofi are four
Sanofi shares for every five YSL shares. This was incorrectly reported in
yesterday's FT.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVENPORT Vernon, the multi-franchise motor group , increased its pre-tax
profits by 14.7 per cent from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 1.64m in the year to
September 30 on turnover which rose from Pounds 99.73m to Pounds 114.15m.
Mr Ralph Denne, chairman, said that as a result of the difficult conditions
in the industry, opportunities had arisen which allowed the group to take
the initiative to increase substantially the size of Davenport during the
year.
He pointed out that since the flotation in March 1989 the number of motor
operations had increased from 14 to 21.
Earnings per share have risen 11 per cent from 7.3p to 8.1p, but the
dividend total is held at 4p with a proposed final payment of 2.5p.

The purchaser is Procuritas, the risk capital company, which is partly-owned
by Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Prudential Insurance Corp of America and IBM's
English pension fund. NCC said it was selling the operation to concentrate
on core business. Linjedack produced a profit of SKr18m on turnover of

<TEXT>
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is to cut car
production by about 15 per cent this year to allow for an estimated 19 per
cent slump in domestic registrations, writes Christopher Parkes. According
to Mr David Herman, managing director, total west European new car sales
will fall 8 per cent this year, from 13.4m to 12.3m, mainly as a result of a
further fall from 3.95m to 3.2m in Germany, where registrations fell 5 per
cent in 1992. Opel's turnover rose 7 per cent to DM29bn (Pounds 12bn) last
year,

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outperformance of National Power and PowerGen this year suggests a
market belief that British Coal pits can be saved without a sacrifice from
the generators. Whether any subsidy for British Coal is funded from the
nuclear levy or a new surcharge on electricity bills, shareholders will not
bear the cost. The details have to be hammered out in Brussels. But it is
hard to imagine the Eurocrats scuppering the scheme. A bigger risk is that
the government's enthusiasm also leads to measures which the electricity
regulator finds irksome.
A ban on gas-fired power projects, for example, might disappoint National
Power and PowerGen. Both have plans for gas-fired plant. By restricting
competition in generation, though, the government would entrench the
coal-burning duopoly. Even if Professor Littlechild swallowed such political
interference, the chances of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission would increase. While the Treasury is itching to sell its
remaining 40 per cent stake in the generators, that might seem a distant
threat. Equally, five-year deals with British Coal and the regional
electricity companies should underpin earnings growth. But with the shape of
government energy policy still unclear, there is plenty of room for
disappointment.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Industry gambles on recovery and raises prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturers are gambling that recovery is in the air and are using
the margin allowed by devaluation to raise their prices.
Their defence is that they are trying to restore their shattered margins, or
indeed climb out of loss. Critics reply that it is the old devaluation
story: companies are throwing away long-term benefits for short-term profit.
The justification varies from company to company. The simplest case is that
of a German or French importer, for which devaluation represents a price cut
in D-Marks or francs. The UK producer may be compensating for the higher
cost of imported raw materials, or simply pushing up prices in line with the
foreign competition.
Evidence of price increases has been mounting steadily since the turn of the
year. British Steel announced price rises last week of up to 13 per cent,
giving as its reason previous sharp falls in steel prices and the rise in
the cost of raw materials after devaluation. Increases announced by the
company a year ago failed to stick; indeed European steel prices have fallen
by 30 per cent since 1989.
Pilkington, the glassmaker, announced price increases of 8 per cent for its
standard float glass this week. If successful, this will be third time lucky
for Pilkington, which tried to raise prices by 8 per cent in November 1991
and again by 7 per cent last June. In the event, UK prices have fallen by 30
per cent over three years.
Industry analysts yesterday doubted whether the rises would stick, given
over-capacity in the glass industry and the low level of construction
orders.
In the motor industry, the increases began with imported cars. Ford UK has
just put up the prices of its Fiesta and Granada models - both made on the
Continent - by 7.5 per cent after raising them by 2 per cent in October.
Volkswagen of Germany has raised prices by 4.9 per cent having raised them
by 2.9 per cent in November.
Domestically produced cars, many of which have a high imported content, are
starting to follow suit.
Ford cut the prices of UK-built Fiestas and Escorts in October. It has now
raised them by 4.5 per cent. Rover raised its prices last month by 2.9 per
cent.
In personal computers, prices have risen by up to 12.5 per cent since
devaluation. The increases have come in both UK-produced PCs and imports.
Siemens, the German electronics giant with UK sales approaching Pounds 1bn,
said last week it had put through UK price increases of more than 7 per
cent. Mr Jurgen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens UK, said that cost
increases of 15 per cent or more on imports from Germany represented 'a
tremendous problem'.
There are also important industries where there are still no signs of price
recovery. Europe's chemical manufacturers have been trying to implement
price increases since last summer, without success.
RMC, the world's largest concrete manufacturer, said prices were now falling
less steeply but were still some way from stabilising.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shift in market depresses sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM yesterday presented a grim picture of its struggles to come to terms
with fundamental shifts in the computer market.
Sales of IBM's key products - mainframe computers, large capacity data
storage systems and minicomputers - all declined sharply, reflecting a broad
market shift away from centralised computing toward networks of smaller
computers.
Mainframe sales were down 12 per cent for the year, while sales of
minicomputers fell by 'a couple of points for the year in a softening
market'.
Personal computer sales were down by about 15 per cent for the year, despite
a strong comeback in the fourth quarter. One bright spot was the company's
workstation business, which grew by about 30 per cent.
The product sales results reflect an industry-wide shift toward smaller,
less expensive computers that carry lower gross profit margins. IBM said
gross margins in the fourth quarter were 'slightly below 40 per cent,' with
pricing pressure in the mainframe, data storage and PC sectors driving the
decline.
PC profit margins improved in the fourth quarter, raising hopes that pricing
pressures have eased, IBM said. But yesterday Compaq Computer, one of IBM's
largest competitors in the market, announced price cuts of 12 to 16 per cent
on its portable notebook PCs.
Hardware sales declined as a percentage of total revenues to 52 per cent for
the year from 57 per cent in 1991.
This reflects a significant shift in the computer industry, and especially
for IBM, toward services as a primary source of revenue and income. IBM said
its software revenues rose 5.8 per cent for the year, to Dollars 11.1bn.
However, software revenues declined 2 per cent in the fourth quarter,
largely because of lower sales of software for minicomputers.
Services, including consulting and systems integration, rose 31.7 per cent
for the year to Dollars 7.35bn. IBM sees this sector as a significant growth
opportunity and is rapidly expanding its service operations worldwide.
Revenues from rentals and financing rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 4.68bn,
but showed slower growth in the fourth quarter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fourth-quarter operating loss and huge restructuring provisions
announced yesterday by IBM were heavily trailed in advance. Yet the scale of
the company's problems is still breathtaking. While the bureaucracies of
several US corporate giants have been overtaken by a changing business
climate, IBM's plight seems worst of all. The company has seen its main
large computer market dwindle with astonishing speed.
It is fashionable to blame the chairman, Mr John Akers, for being slow off
the mark, but there is little the company could have done to avoid its basic
dilemma. The falling price of computing power was bound to lead eventually
to standardisation and cheaper networks - IBM's personal computer merely
accelerated the process. As a result the company has to run its expensive
mainframe business on vastly reduced revenues. Since there is limited scope
for cost-cutting in that business, margins will be permanently squeezed.
Splitting the company up might help some divisions - notably personal
computers - but there are others, like networking systems, whose fate is
firmly tied to IBM's mainframe sales. It is also far from clear that the
company's aim of becoming a large-scale service and software provider meets
a real need. Investors are balancing the possibility of a dividend cut
following next week's board meeting against their calculations of a break-up
value of the company. But IBM's recovery hinges on its ability to catch up
with change. The omens are poor.

FT  20 JAN 93 / New world order: upstarts overtake IBM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intertaional Business Machines, the creation of Thomas Watson snr., made
its name in tabulating equipment. It was slow into computers but after
the launch of System/360 in 1963, it quickly captured the world market
for mainframes. It dominated data processing for 25 years through
aggressive, resourceful marketing. A latecomer to personal computers, it
eventually dominated that market. IBM planned to achieve dollars 100bn
annual sales by the turn of the century but failed to appreciate the
speed at which customers were moving from expensive mainframes which
commanded high gross profit margins to networks of smaller, cheaper
computers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft was a small personal computer software company in 1980 when
IBM asked its youthful president Bill Gates to develop operating
software for its soon-to-be-launched personal computer. Now some 120 pcs
world-wide run on the company's MS-DOS. The success of the PC made
Microsoft's fortune and ensured its significant position in the future
of the computer industry. Microsoft supplies 30 per cent of the world pc
market; Gates, still only 37, is America's richest man with about
dollars 7bn. While not outstandingly innovative, the company is an
aggressive marketer. It faces a US investigation into allegations of
unfair and monopolistic practices.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel, now the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, benefited
greatly from IBM's decision to use its family of microprocessors for
the market-leading IBM PC. Pc manufacturers aiming to build machines
compatible with IBM's were obliged to use Intel chips or copies made by
other manufacturers. Under Andrew Groves, the semiconductor maker has
fiercely protected its dominant position - some 70 per cent or more
of pcs use Intel chips - by refusing to license its most
sophisticated designs to its competitors. It improved sales and profits
dramatically in 1992 and is expected to repeat the performance this
year with its Pentium chip.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Don't worry about IBM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'THINK]' said the signs that hung in every IBM office in the company's glory
days. Those notices have long gone, but the exhortation lingers. IBM's
decline offers food for thought.
Yesterday's quarterly operating loss, the first in the company's history, is
disappointing news for IBM's shareholders and employees. It is not, however,
a cause for more general dismay. Rather, it marks a moment of transition in
the industry, when leadership passes to the companies that came of age with
the microprocessor.
When IBM had four-fifths of the market for computers in the 1960s and 1970s,
it shaped the way the industry developed. Now that task has fallen to Intel
and Microsoft, suppliers of the chips and the software which process an
increasing proportion of the world's data. Along with IBM's mantle of
leadership, both have inherited the resentment of the less successful. Their
new dominance has led to a chorus of grumbling and - in Microsoft's case -
complaints to the US competition authorities.
From the point of view of the industry's customers, however, the shift away
from an industry dominated by a single company has been beneficial. Though
IBM's greatest success came in the last third of the 20th century, its roots
go back a hundred years to Herman Hollerith's punched cards and the
salesmen's school at National Cash Register.
That inheritance gave IBM a visceral commitment to proprietary technology
and a strong belief in 'account control', obtained through a hugely
expensive network of sales and support staff. Today's management, as it
wrestles with costs, is struggling as much with the legacy of IBM's past
sales techniques as with the transformation of technology.
High costs
By itself, though, the change in technology would have been enough to
undermine IBM's position. The mass production of standard microprocessors
and standard software - a trend which IBM itself did much to foster in the
personal computer sector - has created an industry open to all comers. In
such a world, the high costs of IBM's structure is a damaging competitive
disadvantage.
The new computer industry is based on standard building blocks of hardware
and software. Standardisation has enormous cost advantages for customers.
Not only is it much easier to assemble equipment from competing suppliers;
it is also much cheaper to train staff to use industry standard programs.
Outside suppliers
Such advantages aside, the transformed industry exemplifies some wider
economic trends. It exploits the global division of labour to harness
together Asian manufacturing skills and American inventiveness.
IBM exemplified the economies of scale of the large, integrated corporation.
If it is suffering now, it is doing so partly because the advantage of that
approach has lessened. Many of the services which could previously only be
supplied by dedicated specialist departments inside a large company can now
be supplied by outsiders.
Distribution, system software, application software, systems integration -
all the elements of the IBM model are now available from other, often more
competitive, suppliers. The computer industry is not alone in facing this
dilemma: many other industries are increasingly having to face a future in
which they must decide which of their activities are central, to be defended
at all costs, and which can be better done by external suppliers.
The solution at IBM, as at other large companies faced with similar threats,
is to set each of its divisions free to compete with their external rivals.
It is an open question, however, whether each individual division can win
its own battle; and whether the sum of these individual confrontations will
lead to victory overall.
For the computer industry's customers, the struggle now taking place at IBM
is fascinating but of much less significance to them than it might have been
only a decade ago. Technological and market leadership is now largely
centred elsewhere. A world in which IBM is losing money may seem a strange
one to anyone brought up on the business history of the 20th century; but it
has its compensations.

FT  20 JAN 93 / IBM reports record Dollars 4.97bn loss as mainframe sales
drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday confirmed investors' worst fears
by reporting a net loss of Dollars 4.97bn (Pounds 3.26bn) for 1992, the
biggest annual loss in corporate history, as sales of mainframe computers
dropped sharply in the fourth quarter.
The final quarter was IBM's worst ever. A net loss of Dollars 5.46bn
compared with a loss of Dollars 1.46bn in the same period in 1991. Revenues
declined almost 11 per cent to Dollars 19.56bn from Dollars 21.97bn in the
fourth quarter of 1991.
Mr John Akers, chairman, said that 'difficult problems remain ahead for
IBM'. The outlook for early 1993 remained 'unfavourable', IBM told analysts.
IBM will decide next week whether to reduce its dividend, which now stands
at Dollars 4.84 per share. Last month, Mr Akers said he was unsure of IBM's
ability to maintain the dividend, which analysts now expect to be cut by at
least half. IBM's UK subsidiary was the group's blackest spot. Its operating
losses of Pounds 398m, together with a restructuring charge of Pounds 218m,
added up to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 616m, almost five times the figure in
1991.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, attributed the result to weak demand
for hardware, competitive pressure on margins and currency fluctuations.
Export revenues fell by 6 per cent from Pounds 2.28bn to Pounds 2.14bn,
suggesting a weaker demand in the rest of Europe. IBM's Greenock plant in
Scotland is a main site for personal computer manufacture in Europe.
Total UK revenues fell 6 per cent to Pounds 3.75bn. Mr Nick Temple, the IBM
executive recalled from continental Europe a year ago to return the UK
operation to profitability, said substantial cuts in costs would be sought
in 1993.
Worldwide, IBM reported pre-tax operating income of Dollars 265m, but paid
taxes at the unusually high rate of 117 per cent to produce an after-tax
loss of Dollars 45m or 8 cents per share.
Analysts had been expecting the group to break even in the quarter, based
upon IBM's warnings issued in December.
IBM took pre-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 7.2bn in the fourth
quarter, bringing total charges for the year to Dollars 11.6bn as it
struggled to reduce costs by shedding 40,000 workers and cutting
manufacturing capacity.
Net losses for the year were offset slightly by a gain of Dollars 1.42bn
from a change in accounting for income taxes. Revenues fell 0.4 per cent to
Dollars 64.52bn from Dollars 64.77bn in 1991 when IBM reported a net loss of
Dollars 2.86bn after charges of Dollars 3.7bn.
IBM reported a 'pronounced' decline in sales of mainframe computers and data
storage systems in the fourth quarter. Sales of AS/400 mini-computers, which
had been strong, fell by more than 10 per cent in the final quarter. US and
European sales fell by 'double digit' percentages in the fourth quarter, and
those in Japan by a 'single digit' percentage.
Full-year revenues from non-US operations were Dollars 39.89bn, down 1.1 per
cent. A net loss of Dollars 560m compared with a net profit of Dollars
1.79bn in 1991. Most of the 1992 restructuring costs were charged to US
operations where some 29,000 jobs were cut.
The US operations also carry the bulk of product development costs. In
December, IBM announced plans to cut another 25,000 jobs this year, about
half in Europe.
IBM warned that gross profit margins would remain under pressure. In the
fourth quarter, gross margins declined to 'slightly below 40 per cent' from
49.9 per cent in 1991.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: VW quits small car venture with
Swiss group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, has been forced to abandon its pioneering
small car development project with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker. .
VW, under financial pressure with profits falling, is pulling out to avoid
heavy investment in the project.
SMH said VW was withdrawing because it had to cut costs.
The Swiss company, maker of the popular Swatch watch, said it would continue
with the project and was considering offers and alternative partners.
VW joined forces two years ago with SMH to develop a small electric car for
city use. It is continuing development work on its own city car project,
called Chico, which may be powered by a hybrid petrol/electric power unit or
by a small two-cylinder engine under development.
General Motors, the US carmaker, said yesterday that sales of its
Opel/Vauxhall cars in Europe reached a record 1.61m units last year, a 3.9
per cent rise from 1.55m in 1991.
GM said its cars, which are sold under the Opel brand in continental Europe
and Vauxhall in the UK, captured 12.0 per cent of west European new car
sales in 1992 compared with 11.6 per cent a year earlier.
Total GM group car sales in west Europe (including Saab, Lotus and imports
from the US) rose to 1.69m last year, which pushed GM into second place in
the west European new car sales league behind the Volkswagen group, which
includes which Audi, Seat and Skoda.
GM began production last year at two new assembly plants in eastern Germany
and in Hungary.
It opened an engine plant in Hungary, where it has taken over as market
leader.
It expects to be lifted in Europe with the launch this spring of a new
generation small car to replace the Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR UFFE Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister and leader of the Liberal
party, launched a last-ditch attempt yesterday to prevent power slipping
from the hands of the non-Socialist parties into the hands of the Social
Democratic party. He demanded an immediate recall of the Folketing, or
parliament, to debate last week's report of a judicial inquiry into the
Tamilgate scandal and called on the Social Democratic leader, Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, to drop his current attempts to form an SDP government until the
debate is held.
But the Liberal leader's manoeuvre, designed to force members of the
Folketing to vote on whether they would accept a change to an SDP
administration after 10 years of Conservative-Liberal government without an
election appeared last night to be doomed.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen needs signatures of 72 of the 179 members of the
Folketing to force a debate, but it became apparent last night that he would
not receive sufficient support. The Danish political crisis began last
Thursday when Mr Poul Schluter, leader of the Conservative party and prime
minister since 1982, resigned after being criticised for misleading
parliament in the Tamilgate scandal by the report of a judicial inquiry.
After Mr Schluter's resignation, Mr Rasmussen was called upon by Queen
Margrethe to head negotiations for the formation of a new government.

FT  20 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) YSL and Elf-Sanofi form world's third-biggest
beauty group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 21st January 1993) appended to this article.
ELF-SANOFI, the French drug and perfume company, is to absorb Yves Saint
Laurent, one of the most famous names in Paris fashion, to create the
world's third-biggest beauty products company.
The deal, based on a share exchange of four of Sanofi's shares for every one
YSL share, was announced yesterday. Trading in the two companies' shares is
to resume today. Before it was suspended on Monday, Elf-Sanofi's shares were
FFr1,100 and YSL shares were FFr630.
The merger provides a way out for YSL's two controlling partners - the
fashion designer of the same name and his long-time friend and co-founder,
Mr Pierre Berge - of a financial squeeze that had left them shouldering
increased debt with sharply reduced profits.
Mr Berge, who will keep management control of the fashion side of YSL but
lose that of the perfume side of the business, said he had long been
concerned about the company's long-term future. This was now assured, he
said, with Sanofi as a partner.
Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, Elf-Sanofi's president, said the merger was a great
opportunity to add an illustrious name to its list of perfume brands - Oscar
de la Renta, Roger &amp; Gallet, Stendhal and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.
Elf-Sanofi, whose total turnover of around FFr19bn (Pounds 2.25bn) is about
six times that of YSL, is principally interested in acquiring 'image, rather
than cash flow', according to one executive.
Mr Dehecq yesterday forecast that Elf-Sanofi's net profits in 1992 will
'comfortably top' FFr1bn, up from FFr956m in 1991. This contrasts with the
plunge in YSL profits last year to FFr2.6m in the first six months compared
with FFr41m in the same period of the previous year.
At present, Mr Yves Saint Laurent and Mr Berge control more than 40 per cent
of YSL. This partnership will be wound up and YSL's two founders will have
8.1 per cent of the new YSL group.
Elf-Acquitaine, the state-owned oil company which controls Elf-Sanofi, is
not subscribing to this share issue, and so will see its stake in its
subsidiary drop from 61 per cent to 51.5 per cent.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, Elf-Acquitaine's president, said he was pleased to
see Elf-Sanofi diversify at no cost to the parent company.
CORRECTION
THE terms of the merger between Yves Saint Laurent and Elf-Sanofi are four
Sanofi shares for every five YSL shares. This was incorrectly reported in
yesterday's FT.

<TEXT>
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, and Shell
Exploration, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, announced yesterday an
agreement to co-operate with three Russian companies in developing oil and
gas fields in the Timan Pechora basin in the northern Russian Archangels
province.
'Shell is joining Saga in an agreement of intentions previously entered
between Saga and the Russian enterprises Severgasprom, Arkhangekskgeologia
and Ukhtaneftegasgeologia regarding the creation of a joint venture,' Saga
Petroleum explained. The joint venture being negotiated is a proposed 50:50
Russian and foreign co-operation, and aims to develop discovered oil and gas
fields.
Severgasprom, the leading Russian partner in the pact, has applied for
exploitation licences on behalf of the group. The licences comprise the oil
fields Mid and North-Kharyaga and five gas and gas condensate fields.
Saga said the joint venture also aimed to apply for exploration and
production licences for an area near the discovered fields.
One appraisal well is planned this year on the Mid-Kharyaga field which may
be cored, logged and tested by western contractors financed by Saga and
Shell.
For two years Saga and its Russian partners have been negotiating a joint
venture agreement and undertaken joint petroleum reserves studies, technical
development scenarios and economic feasibility studies, but Saga said
further appraisal activities, studies and commercial negotiations were
required before the commercial viability of the fields could be declared.
Saga said the group aimed this year to conclude a feasibility study,
environmental impact study and a joint venture agreement.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: ITT takes Dollars 612m
restructure charge
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, is to take a Dollars 612m fourth-quarter after-tax
charge to cover a restructuring of ITT Financial, its finance subsidiary,
including large loss provisions in its domestic unsecured consumer loan
portfolio.
The move was portrayed by the company as a positive step to eliminate
problems and concentrate the finance company's energies on its more
profitable businesses, which range from consumer home equity loans to
capital finance.
On Wall Street, ITT's share price rose Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 71
1/2 .
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, affirmed ITT's rating, but
downgraded the outlook to negative because of 'ongoing disappointing
earnings'. Moody's placed its ratings under review for possible downgrading,
while Fitch affirmed its ratings.
ITT Financial will take pre-tax charges of Dollars 928m (Dollars 612m after
tax), including a Dollars 693m provision for unsecured consumer loan losses
as it runs off its existing portfolio; Dollars 103m for restructuring, as it
consolidates its loan branches from 600 to 400 and cuts its workforce of
5,400 people by about 1,400; and Dollars 132m for losses in its commercial
property portfolio.
To preserve ITT Financial's capital ratios, the parent company is to
contribute Dollars 612m to the subsidiary, including shares in Alcatel
Alsthom, the French industrial group which ITT acquired last year.
Last October, ITT took a Dollars 582m charge to strengthen reserves at its
Hartford insurance subsidiary. It added Dollars 680m of capital to the
insurance unit, including Dollars 380m of Alcatel Alsthom stock. The
Hartford and the financial subsidiary together provide more than half of the
group's operating profits.
The restructuring of the finance arm follows a review by Mr Frank Schultz,
chairman of the subsidiary, who said the size and quality of the unsecured
consumer small loan business had been diminishing because of the rapid
growth of credit card and home equity loans.
ITT said it would also take a Dollars 53m pre-tax restructuring charge at
its defence and electronic components businesses, a Dollars 45m charge for
troubled assets at its Sheraton hotels group and Dollars 45m pre-tax charge
for an accounting change.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm second half boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Eurotherm, the temperature control and drives company, more than
doubled last year helped by cost cutting and improved margins.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 14.6m in the year to
October 31 last. At the interim stage, profits were 46 per cent ahead at
Pounds 6.7m.
Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said it was a 'year of reconstruction' after the
company misjudged the depth of recession and had to attack its cost base.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 2.4m were taken in the previous year, with a
further Pounds 500,000 charged as an administrative expense this time. In
the last two years employees have fallen by nearly one-third to just over
2,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 157.7m to Pounds 154.6m following the disposal
half way through the year of two unprofitable subsidiaries which had annual
sales of about Pounds 8m. Mr Leonard said Eurotherm's maintained levels of
sales in shrinking international markets suggested the company had improved
market share.
Eurotherm continued to generate cash, despite an increase in capital
expenditure from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6.3m. Net borrowings fell from Pounds
15.6m to Pounds 7.4m while gearing dropped from 30 per cent to 12.9 per
cent.
Earnings increased from 10.6p to 22.3p. The directors proposed a final
dividend of 5p (4.7p) to make a total of 8p (7.2p), an increase of 11 per
cent.
COMMENT
These results were well received, even through the scale of recovery is
flattered by comparison with a poor 1991. With the benefits of restructuring
largely on board, Eurotherm appears close to recovering historical levels of
profitability. Gross margins have improved by 3 percentage points to 48 per
cent, and should rise beyond 50 per cent in the medium term. Meanwhile, this
year's profits are partly underwritten by currency factors since, with 70
per cent of sales overseas, average sterling exchange rates are likely to be
beneficial. However, all this good news is already in the price, especially
after yesterday's 24p rise to 495p. The shares have now risen more than 20
per cent since the start of December. Forecast profits this year of Pounds
18m put them on a prospective p/e of more than 18. Amid a sector long on
recovery plays, Eurotherm is starting to look expensive.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN forces in Bosnia are conducting a campaign of calculated cruelty
against Moslems that 'dwarfs anything seen in Europe since Nazi times,' the
US State Department claimed yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Civilians are the primary targets of military action in the former Yugoslav
republic, making a mockery of the Geneva Convention, the department said in
its annual human rights report to Congress. By the end of 1992, more than
1.5m people were displaced by the war, including an estimated one-half of
the Moslem population, the report said.
All sides in the former Yugoslav republic are guilty of atrocities, but 'the
atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Moslems pale in comparison to the sheer
scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses committed by
Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Moslems', the report
said.
'The policy of driving out innocent civilians of a different ethnic or
religious group from their homes, so-called ethnic cleansing, was practiced
by Serbian forces in Bosnia on a scale that dwarfs anything seen in Europe
since Nazi times,' it said.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Errors found in sick-pay scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHECKS on employers' administration of statutory sick and maternity pay
schemes have consistently found monetary errors in 25 per cent to 30 per
cent of cases, the National Audit Office says in a report today, Alan Pike
writes.
The Department of Social Security's monitoring of the schemes was
'insufficient for the effective supervision of a programme costing more than
Pounds 1bn a year,' concludes the report. It says there was 'little
assurance' that the objectives of the sick pay and maternity pay schemes
were being fulfilled, that public funds were being adequately controlled or
that employees could always expect to receive their correct entitlements.
In 1991-92 statutory sick pay payments totalled Pounds 900m and maternity
pay totalled Pounds 350m. Employers pay the benefits but recover most of the
cost - Pounds 1.1bn in 1991-92 - from the National Insurance fund.
The DSS, says the report, had sought to keep the schemes as simple as
possible for employers to administer. It was, with the Contributions and
Benefits agencies, working hard to improve monitoring and oversight.
'But their plans will need to be pursued vigorously, and supplemented by
further action, if the interests of the exchequer and employees are to be
fully safeguarded,' the report says.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Scotch industry demands tax change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTCH whisky industry, faced with a fall in UK sales of 1m cases a year
and a spate of job losses, is pressing for a radical reform of drinks
taxation.
Heavy excise duties have been a significant factor in the accelerating
decline of whisky's share of the drinks market, the Scotch Whisky
Association says in a pre-Budget submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
Since 1979, whisky sales have fallen 30 per cent while wine consumption has
increased 60 per cent.
The association said: 'The chancellor must act now to remove or reduce the
differentials between the duty on spirits and the duty on beer and wine.'
It urged the practice of index-linking duty on spirits to be discontinued
and that there should be no increase in duty until differentials have been
substantially eroded.
The association said the UK drinks market had changed markedly since the
1960s and the government response to the changes had been 'woefully
inadequate'.
While alcohol consumption per head had remained largely unchanged, consumers
could now choose from a wider range of products. Whisky had to compete
against heavily marketed white spirits such as gin and vodka, a greater
variety of beers and, in particular, a much wider selection of wines.
A single whisky and a glass of wine contain the same amount of alcohol - but
the whisky carries 23p duty compared with wine's 12p.
'High excise duties must have a substantial adverse impact on sales within a
depressed market,' the association said. 'Market trends indicate that
imported wines have been the main winner - Scotch whisky the main loser.'
In the 1960s, Scotch accounted for 60 per cent of UK spirits sales and 10.5
per cent of total alcohol consumption. It now represented 41 per cent of
spirits, and 8.6 per cent of the total alcohol market.
The association said this decline in sales had led to falling returns to the
exchequer. Real excise duty revenue raised from Scotch had fallen by 44 per
cent since 1979 and by 26 per cent for other spirits. 'If the chancellor
wants to maintain the real value of excise duties from alcoholic drinks, he
must switch the burden of taxes from spirits to beers and wines,' it said.
Discrimination against spirits in the domestic market had wider implications
for the industry, it added. So long as Scotch attracted heavier taxes than
beer and wine in the UK, other European Community states were unlikely to
ease the tax burden on the product.

FT  20 JAN 93 / NHS told to seek links with private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Health Service managers should work more closely with the private
sector, a government circular says.
In a letter today to hospital and health authority finance managers, Mr
Gordon Greenshields, NHS director of finance, calls for more joint ventures
with the private sector. He also wants leasing arrangements and
market-testing of the possibilities of contracting out patient and support
services.
The letter, which tells managers to be 'innovative and receptive' to new
ideas for increasing the use of private finance, is the department's
response to the announcement in the 1992 Autumn Statement of arrangements to
ease the use of private capital in the public sector. It also reflects the
view of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, that the government has
taken the sting from the controversy over NHS reforms and can promote
private investment without reviving allegations that it wants to privatise
the service.
Mrs Bottomley said yesterday: 'The old apartheid between the public and
private sectors should be buried. The NHS is not for privatisation and it is
not for sale. Where there are opportunities for the NHS to involve the
private sector in cost-effective initiatives that benefit patients, they
should be taken.'
Mr Greenshields' letter says the greater scope for using private capital in
the NHS will mean 'additional resources for health care'. Managers will be
told to consider joint ventures in areas such as waste incineration and
energy conservation.
Leasing will not count against hospitals' external financing limits or cash
allocations, provided it gives better value. Computers and transport are
among areas the department considers suitable for leasing.
The guidance follows talks between Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister,
and representatives of potential private-sector partners.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Hatton 'at centre of web' in land deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, was
paid almost Pounds 120,000 to help push through a corrupt Pounds 1.8m land
deal, the Crown Court at Mold, Clwyd, was told yesterday.
Mr Hatton was alleged to have been at 'the centre of the web' in a plot to
cheat the council by dishonestly using confidential information.
Mr Hatton; former councillors Mr John Nelson and Ms Hannah Folan; and two
businessmen, Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, all deny charges of conspiring
to defraud Liverpool City Council.
Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said Settleside, Mr Hatton's public
relations company, received an average of almost Pounds 30,000 a year from
Mr Stewart over a four-year period.
He said Ms Folan passed to Mr Hatton the confidential information that a
20-acre site in the city was to be offered for commercial development.
He claimed Mr Hatton, who ceased to be a councillor in 1987, told Mr
Stewart, head of a development company, that the land was to be made
available for retail purposes.
Mr Rawley also alleged that the council committee which Ms Folan chaired had
given Mr Stewart an option to buy the land against the advice of council
officials that it should be offered for tender.
Mr Stewart's company, Rogerson Developments, paid Settleside regular sums
for 'public relations and research', said Mr Rawley. 'That is an awful lot
of public relations.' The trial continues.

FT  20 JAN 93 / PSBR figure for December rises sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOOST to tax payments caused by a change in the rules for collecting value
added tax failed to prevent a sharp rise in the public sector borrowing
requirement for December.
The Treasury said yesterday that last month's PSBR climbed to Pounds 3.43bn
compared with Pounds 1.33bn in December 1991. The rise was caused mainly by
a big increase in public spending. The total PSBR for the first nine months
of 1992-93 was Pounds 25.7bn compared with Pounds 10.3bn in the
corresponding period for the previous year.
The Treasury forecasts a PSBR for 1992-93 of Pounds 37bn after one of Pounds
13.8bn in 1991-92. Much of the change is because of weak economic activity
constraining tax receipts, while rising unemployment has pushed up social
security spending. The spiralling deficit is casting a cloud over the March
16 Budget, in which the government may be forced to increase taxes to reduce
borrowing. Government receipts last month came to Pounds 6.49bn compared
with Pounds 5.89bn in the corresponding month a year before.
The relatively high figure was due mainly to additional VAT revenues, caused
by many large companies making these payments on a monthly basis rather than
quarterly. The Treasury said that because of the change, receipts in
December were between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn higher than would have been
expected.
Receipts this month are also likely to be boosted while the figure for
February will be correspondingly reduced.
Spending by central government departments last month amounted to Pounds
19.91bn compared with Pounds 16.2bn in December 1991. Spending during the
first nine months of the financial year totalled Pounds 179.3bn, 14 per cent
up on the Pounds 156.9bn spent in the first three quarters of 1991-92.
The spending figures are calculated after allowing for privatisation
proceeds, which totalled Pounds 1.3bn in December.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Footwear workers win 2.5% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTWEAR WORKERS are to receive a pay rise of 2.5 per cent in March. The
deal covers about 30,000 employees, some 60 per cent of the industry's
workforce.
The industry's workers received a rise of 3.75 per cent in May last year.
The National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades said it had put
on hold its aspiration for a shorter working week and longer holidays in
return for the pay rise and retention of the national agreement until next
February.
Footwear workers earn on average between Pounds 170 and Pounds 180 a week.
About 5,000 jobs have been lost in the industry since mid-1991.
The pay deal gives an early indication that the government's 1.5 per cent
limit for the public sector may be exerting downward pressure on rises in
the private sector.
However, although most pay experts expect that the majority of the public
sector will receive increases of about 1.5 per cent this year, there are
doubts about whether the government will be able to prevent increases rising
next year.
Some public-sector employers have warned that the 1.5 per cent benchmark is
raising pay aspirations in the public sector. Mr Stephen Bubb of the
Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said yesterday
that without the limit, many councils would have insisted on pay freezes
this year.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Solicitors' profits sink to 10-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of solicitors' firms in England and Wales fell last year to their
lowest level for 10 years according to the annual survey of law firm
performance carried out by the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. The centre
said prospects for this year appeared little better.
Profits of provincial firms were particularly badly hit. Typical profits per
partner for provincial firms fell from Pounds 25,000 in 1991 to Pounds
11,000 last year, after deduction of a notional salary of Pounds 35,000.
On this basis 30 per cent (1,813) of the 6,046 provincial firms in England
and Wales were loss-making last year compared with only 7.5 per cent in
1991.
Of the provincial firms in the study in 1991 and 1992, two thirds were less
profitable in 1992 including all the firms in the south-east.
London firms fared better. Typical profits per partner last year were Pounds
90,000, after deduction of Pounds 50,000 notional salary, compared with more
than Pounds 100,000 two years ago.
Among provincial firms the steady fall in profit margins of the past three
years had previously been offset by better productivity. That did not happen
last year, the centre said.
In 1990 the typical profit margin for a provincial firm was 15 per cent; in
1991 it was 12 per cent and last year it fell to 5 per cent.
Overall, provincial firms enjoyed an 11 per cent increase in revenue last
year but 25 per cent of such firms experienced a fall in revenue. Litigation
was the fastest growing type of work but commercial work was the most
profitable.
Staff costs rose from 53 per cent to 58 per cent of revenue. Accommodation
costs and operating costs have also risen to 10 per cent and 27 per cent of
revenue respectively.
The average level of profitability of London firms fell slightly last year.
Profit margins stabilised at 19 per cent of revenue - the same as in 1991
and revenue per head was also constant at Pounds 60,000.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Record Pounds 546m of drugs seized
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise seized a record Pounds 546m worth of illegal drugs last
year including more than two tonnes of cocaine, according to figures
released yesterday.
There were 2,568 arrests and 47 drug smuggling gangs were broken up during
the year, the 1992 annual drug seizures statistics show.
Cocaine hauls totalling Pounds 329m - more than twice the amount of the
previous year - were confiscated. There were seizures of heroin with a
street value of Pounds 48m and cannabis worth Pounds 134m.
The seizure values rose from a total of Pounds 271m in 1991, but included
declines of a quarter in the value of synthetic drugs confiscated to Pounds
35m, and of nearly two thirds for opium to Pounds 37,000.
The figures were released two weeks after Customs announced its latest
anti-drug co-operation agreement with the Cruising Association, signed at
the London International Boat Show. The guidelines call for yacht users to
keep constant vigilance and to report quickly anything suspicious.
They should in particular notify officials of suspicious vessels or crews,
unusual activity in remote places, small boats approaching larger vessels or
suspect packages on beaches, at ports or at sea.
In return, Customs pledges to treat any information in strict confidence and
to help educate yacht users in how to avoid being exploited by drug
traffickers.

FT  20 JAN 93 / 'Gold-plate era' ends at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to the chairman's office at Lloyd's of London will no longer be
greeted and served tea by 'waiters' in Victorian navy blue and crimson tail
coats.
Mr 'Tug' Wilson and Mr Malcolm Archard will be the last 'chairman's waiters'
in Lloyd's 305-year history. Their redeployment this week signals the
adoption of a more business-like approach at the Lloyd's Corporation and the
end of what one insider called the 'gold-plated era', as the market adapts
to more difficult circumstances after three years of heavy losses.
Of the 26 other ancillary staff who worked for the leaders of the Lloyd's
market, 12 will lose their jobs this week - among them two of the four
chauffeurs formerly assigned exclusively to the chairman, his two deputies
and the chief executive. The corporation's Rolls-Royce was sold last year,
leaving Lloyd's leaders with the occasional use of two Jaguars.
'The days when the Lloyd's chairman sent three people ahead of him on his
travels to check the hotel beds have gone,' said Mr Robert Hiscox, one of
two new deputy chairmen, who is delighted at the change. 'It should be run
as a business, not an institution,' he added.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, announced a Pounds 26m cut in the
corporation's budget late last year. This week staff were asked to apply for
voluntary redundancy and early retirement as the corporation pressed ahead
with plans to axe 272 of the 2,262 jobs.
Further more drastic cuts could come in the next few months.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Rules for priming pumps prove costly: Deborah Hargreaves on
the reasons for big rises in petrol prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL surprised the oil industry when it raised petrol prices this week,
adding about 9p a gallon to the pump price of four star. It was followed
yesterday by Texaco which increased prices for petrol - but not diesel - by
the same amount, claiming that prices were moving back to a more realistic
level after large cuts last month.
Esso, the market leader, and British Petroleum were taken aback by the price
rises. Both said they were monitoring the market but had no immediate plans
to raise prices.
A month ago Shell decided to slash pump prices by 18p a gallon - the biggest
cut so far in petrol prices - after BP sparked a round of reductions with a
13p a gallon cut. Other leading oil companies followed the move.
Those cuts were made on the back of a drop of Dollars 3 a barrel in world
oil prices since October.
Given that prices have since fallen by a further Dollars 1 a barrel, it
would be surprising if companies were seeking to justify this week's price
increases with the usual arguments about higher world prices. Nor do they
blame changes in the dollar-sterling exchange rate (international oil trade
is priced in dollars).
Rather, Shell is unhappy that ruthless competition in the market has pared
margins to the bone, making it difficult to pay for increasingly tough
environmental measures.
Mr David Pirret, general manager of Shell's retail division, said: 'In a
tough marketplace where prices have to give Shell and its retailers adequate
profitability to fund the increasing investment required to meet safety and
environmental standards, prices now have to move back up.'
Shell estimates that it costs Pounds 92,000 more to build a service station
than it did 10 years ago because of tougher environmental standards. But
intense competition among petrol retailers has kept returns to the industry
low.
'Neither retailers nor oil companies are making enough money in this
business to fund the environmental improvements needed,' said Mr Bruce
Petter, director of the Petroleum Retailers Association.
A Shell official said yesterday: 'There's no question about our regretting
that December cut in prices. It was good for us.' This means that Shell
increased its market share in an intensely competitive business.
While oil companies are competing fiercely for market share between
themselves, they are also facing an assault on their business from
supermarkets and hypermarkets. Such businesses have doubled their share of
the petrol market in the past two years, from about 6.8 per cent at the
beginning of 1991 to about 15 per cent now.
The ability of supermarkets to undercut oil companies has arisen partly from
overcapacity in the oil refining sector. Some oil companies are running too
much oil through their refineries, leaving them with a glut of petrol to
sell cheaply to hypermarkets.
It is a vicious circle that is bound to end up in a contraction of the
service station market over the next 10 years. Some market watchers believe
the UK will lose about 5,000 of its 20,000 sites in the next decade.
This will partly be a result of the inability of some stations to invest in
the type of environmental and safety standards required by government and
European Community legislation.
Shell estimates it costs Pounds 12,000, for example, to equip a new service
station with twin-walled petrol tanks - an EC requirement being phased in
over the next two years.
In addition, companies have to spend about Pounds 14,000 to recycle the
water used in the car wash, Pounds 4,000 on measures to stop tanks
over-filling and Pounds 6,000 to remove old storage tanks, according to
Shell.
'We want people to know that when the price goes up, it is also driven by
the need for companies to remain profitable,' a Shell official said. The
company plans to spend Pounds 250m over the next five years on revamping its
petrol station network and franchising its stations.
Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips and Drew, said:
'Margins in petrol retailing may be low now but to say that they are lower
than the return made by other industries is rather a dangerous
generalisation.'
Tax accounts for almost 70 per cent of the cost of petrol to the consumer.
Petrol prices are in fact slightly lower now than in 1960.
According to figures from UBS Phillips and Drew, petrol prices were 47.4p
per litre in 1960 and averaged 45.9p per litre last year. 'There is nothing
to suggest excessive profitability by the oil companies,' said Mr Gilbert
Jenkins, an independent energy consultant.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Government retreats on rail competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has climbed down over one of the principal aspects of its
rail privatisation plans - the requirement that there should be open
competition on the tracks between rival train operators.
Instead it has decided that private-sector companies will be granted
exclusive franchises for all passenger services in many areas, as with
commercial television franchises.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has reluctantly conceded the need
for exclusive franchises in the face of the private sector's reluctance to
become involved in any form of privatisation that would involve open
competition on the tracks.
Companies feared that, once granted a franchise, they might see their most
profitable services attacked by others. That might undermine potential
profitability and leaving companies unclear about whether, or how much, to
bid for a franchise.
Speaking to the Freight On Rail group of private-sector rail freight
operators in London yesterday, Mr MacGregor said the government's interest
lay in ensuring that rail services were improved by extending the role of
the private sector to the maximum extent possible.
'If some individual franchises have to be exclusive in whole or in part,
then they will be made so,' he said. 'This will not be necessary in all
cases. But to the extent that it is necessary, it will be done.'
The government is understood to be planning a two-tier system of franchises:
investment franchises, which could last up to 30 years because companies
would expect them to cover the life of their investment, and management-only
franchises which could come up for renewal in as little as five years.
Details of the proposals are due to emerge with the publication of the
Railways Bill on Friday.
Meanwhile Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the Commons transport committee, will
today publish a low-key interim report on his committee's study of the
government's privatisation plans.
Mr Adley, a Conservative backbencher, is believed to have toned down his
strongly expressed personal criticisms of the plans in order to preserve the
unanimity of the cross-party committee.
Mr MacGregor yesterday adopted a conciliatory tone towards Mr Adley, saying
he was struck by the amount of common ground between them.
Where they differed, he said, was in Mr Adley's view that operation of the
tracks should not be split from operation of the trains. Mr Mac-Gregor said
that some franchises would extend to the operation of the tracks as well as
the trains. But this would only apply to relatively self-contained parts of
the railway, and the government remained committed to the principle of a
separate track-owning authority.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Caution in Midlands on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLANDS business leaders warned yesterday that recent improvements in the
sales and orders of industrial companies, especially in exports, do not mean
the recession is ending.
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in the
west Midlands, said after a regional council meeting: 'There are
reservations about how long it (the improvement) will last.'
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said at the meeting: 'We are
not running up the flags at this point about the recovery. We've had two
blips up before in this recession.'
Mr Nigel Chubb, director of the Engineering Employers' East Midlands
Association, said: 'For the first time in two years there appear to be faint
flickerings that the industry is on the turn.' He reported that 40 per cent
of companies in an association survey expected total orders to improve over
the next three months.
But he said: 'We are not expecting any dramatic improvements for 1993.' He
noted that the industry has 'a mountain to climb to recover from the
recessionary effects of the last 2 1/2 years'.
Recent experience of east Midlands engineering companies, leading to what Mr
Chubb called 'a much more stable position as far as future orders are
concerned,' mirrors the findings of recent surveys from chambers of commerce
across the country.
Devaluation has given companies a competitive advantage in export markets,
but the flatness of the domestic market, the construction industry's
weakness and the slowdown in European markets, has made business leaders
cautious.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Arrival of Japanese car plants will fuel growth of
components sector, says study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL of Japanese car plants in the UK will help fuel sustained growth
for the motor components sector, says a study of the component industry's
prospects, John Griffiths writes. It predicts that the plants will lift
total demand for parts to Pounds 5.7bn by 1996 from Pounds 5bn last year.
The study expects a 25 per cent increase in demand for components from
vehicle makers over the period, based on an expected rise in car production
from 1.25m last year to 1.5m in 1994.
The market for equipment for new cars is expected to grow from Pounds 1.37bn
last year to Pounds 1.71bn by 1996.
The market for replacement parts is expected to grow more slowly - from an
estimated Pounds 3.7bn last year to Pounds 3.99bn in 1994.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Betting shops allowed to open on summer evenings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTING shops will be allowed to stay open until 10pm from April 1 until
August 31, the end of the summer evening horse-racing season, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, announced yesterday.
The move, extending the opening hours of 7am to 6.30pm fixed in 1986,
follows persistent lobbying by some bookmakers for later opening to allow
off-course punters to bet on the increasing number of race meetings held in
the summer.
Bigger bookmakers have argued that later opening will help increase
turnover, but many independent bookmakers and some betting-shop staff have
opposed the idea because of longer working hours and staffing difficulties.
The exchequer, which at present collects Pounds 500m a year in duty from the
betting industry, will benefit from the longer opening hours. Betting
turnover should increase by at least 10 per cent with evening opening,
bringing in an additional Pounds 50m or more in tax.
Greyhound racing officials have opposed extending opening hours. Most
greyhound race meetings are held in the evening and the officials fear many
followers might be lured into betting shops instead.
Mr Clarke said in a Commons written answer that evening opening would give a
boost to the leisure industry and would be welcomed by many horse-racing
enthusiasts. 'It will allow bookmakers to match their opening hours to the
needs and wishes of their customers,' he said.
He added that it was clear from responses to a government consultation
document published in October 1991 that the growth in the number of evening
horse-race meetings had increased consumer demand for evening opening of
licensed betting offices during summer months. The government had decided
there were no public interest or policy reasons to object to evening
opening.
The Betting Office Licensees Association said there was little doubt the
decision would be welcomed by the betting public as the quantity and quality
of evening racing had steadily increased and the betting industry's role was
to provide a service whenever horse racing was taking place.
It added: 'We understand the apprehension of the industry faced with a
change of this magnitude, but off-course betting must be prepared to move
with the times if it is to survive in its present form.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / Church of England makes history with television comercial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Church of England last night made history with the first religious
commercial on British television, Gary Mead writes.
The diocese of Lichfield in Staffordshire is spending Pounds 7,700 on 10
commercial slots over the next fortnight, with two different advertisements.
Last night's 20-second advertisement was screened to a potential audience of
about 8m viewers in Central Television's west region in the break during
News At Ten.
The advertisement featured a fast-moving sequence of still photographs,
building up in speed against the background of a drum beat. The pictures,
which included shots of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, a starving child,
urban desolation, the Braer tanker, and a group of police officers, were
designed to reflect the diversity of human experience - joy and pain, life
and death, stupidity and concern. The Venerable Dennis Ede, archdeacon of
Stoke-on-Trent and communications chairman for the diocese, said: 'If you
are selling a product it's quite clear - people can either buy or not. We
are not selling a product; it's not trying to persuade people to come to
church next Sunday.' He added: 'It's an advert that may prompt people to
think about the existence of God; the aim is not bums on pews.
'There will be those who will say we are prostituting ourselves and that we
are treating the Church of England like a tin of beans. But we are not into
telly evangelism. This is the gentle use of a new medium and is very much an
experiment.'
The 1990 Broadcasting Act allowed religious groups to advertise on
television from January 1 this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUST savings schemes last year showed their first annual fall in
intake since records began in 1984. The total amount invested through the
schemes was Pounds 115.5m, down from Pounds 119.5m in 1991.
This was in spite of a strong fourth-quarter intake of Pounds 33.49m - the
best quarterly figure since 1984. Lump sum investments accounted for most of
the rise during the quarter, totalling Pounds 21.72m, an increase of 87 per
cent on the third quarter.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies attributed the year's fall to
an exceptionally weak third quarter, when Pounds 23.5m was invested.

CASES of bogus job offers are highlighted in the latest Advertising
Standards Authority monthly report.
A complaint by the Department of Trade and Industry was upheld against
Worldwide Recruitment Services, which put an advertisement in a national
newspaper suggesting that building work was available in Hong Kong.
Respondents were required to pay a Pounds 10 administration fee.
The DTI maintained that as an abundance of local workers was present in Hong
Kong and China, such jobs would probably not be available to UK residents.
The advertisers failed to respond to the authority's inquiries.
The latest ASA report covers complaints against 63 companies.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Record Pounds 546m of drugs seized
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise seized a record Pounds 546m worth of illegal drugs last
year including more than two tonnes of cocaine, according to figures
released yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
There were 2,568 arrests and 47 drug smuggling gangs broken up during the
year, the annual drug seizures statistics show. Cocaine hauls totalling
Pounds 329m - more than twice the amount of the previous year - were
confiscated. There were seizures of heroin with a street value of Pounds 48m
and cannabis worth Pounds 134m.
The seizure values rose from a total of Pounds 271m in 1991, but included
declines of a quarter in the value of synthetic drugs confiscated to Pounds
35m, and of nearly two thirds for opium to Pounds 37,000.
The figures were released two weeks after Customs announced its latest
anti-drug co-operation agreement with the Cruising Association, signed at
the London International Boat Show.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Law firm profits at lowest for 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS of solicitors' firms in England and Wales fell last year to their
lowest level for 10 years according to the annual survey of law firm
performance carried out by the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. The centre
said prospects for this year appeared little better.
Profits of provincial firms were particularly badly hit. Typical profits per
partner for provincial firms fell from Pounds 25,000 in 1991 to Pounds
11,000 last year after deduction of a notional salary of Pounds 35,000.
On this basis 30 per cent (1,813) of the 6,046 provincial firms in England
and Wales were lossmaking last year compared with only 7.5 per cent in 1991.
Of the provincial firms in the study in 1991 and 1992, two thirds were less
profitable last year, including all the firms in the south-east.
Typical profits per partner in London last year were Pounds 90,000, after a
Pounds 50,000 notional salary compared with more than Pounds 100,000 two
years ago.
Among provincial firms the fall in profit margins of the past three years
had previously been offset by better productivity. That did not happen last
year, the centre said. In 1990 the typical profit margin for a provincial
firm was 15 per cent; in 1991 it was 12 per cent and last year it was 5 per
cent.
Overall, provincial firms enjoyed an 11 per cent increase in revenue last
year but 25 per cent of such firms experienced a fall in revenue. Litigation
was the fastest growing category, but commercial work was the most
profitable.
Staff costs rose from 53 per cent to 58 per cent of revenue. Accommodation
costs and operating costs have also risen to 10 per cent and 27 per cent of
revenue respectively.
The average level of profitability of London firms fell slightly last year.
Profit margins stabilised at 19 per cent of revenue - the same as in 1991.
Revenue per head was also constant at Pounds 60,000.
Collectively, London firms enjoyed 13 per cent growth in 1992 with
litigation, the fastest-growing area, increasing by 25 per cent.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Row grows on council job rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over the legal status of employees' rights, which is casting a
shadow on the government's competitive tendering policy, intensified
yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes. The Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities recommended council to ignore advice on the issue
from the Department of the Environment.
The dispute is over application to the public sector of the 1981 Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, which give UK employees
rights under an EC directive to keep their terms and conditions if their
business changes hands.
The government insists that the regulations do not 'as a general rule' apply
when a council or government service is contracted out to the private
sector.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Hatton at 'centre of the web' in land deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool Council, was paid
almost Pounds 120,000 to help push through a corrupt Pounds 1.8m land deal,
Mold Crown Court was told yesterday.
Mr Hatton was alleged to have been at 'the centre of the web' in a plot to
cheat the council by dishonestly using highly confidential information.
Mr Hatton; former councillors Mr John Nelson and Ms Hannah Folan; and two
businessmen, Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, all deny charges of conspiring
to defraud Liverpool City Council.
Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said Settleside, Mr Hatton's public
relations company, received an average of almost Pounds 30,000 a year from
Mr Stewart over a four-year period.
He said Ms Folan passed to Mr Hatton the confidential information that a
20-acre site in the city was to be offered for commercial development.
He claimed Mr Hatton, who ceased to be a councillor in 1987, told Mr
Stewart, head of a development company, that the land was to be made
available for retail purposes.
Mr Rawley also alleged that the council committee which Ms Folan chaired had
given Mr Stewart an option to buy the land against the advice of council
officials that it should be offered for tender.
Mr Stewart's company, Rogerson Developments, paid Settleside regular sums
for 'public relations and research', said Mr Rawley. He told the jury: 'What
we are suggesting is that the payments going to Mr Hatton, of just under
Pounds 30,000 a year, were for the influence he could bring to bear on Ms
Folan.'
Mr Rawley said Mr Hatton's diaries contained entries at the time of the deal
showing there was regular contact between Mr Hatton and Ms Folan, and
between Mr Hatton and Mr Stewart.
The trial continues today.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANY SERIOUS threat to the nomination of Ms Zoe Baird as attorney general in
the Clinton administration was much diminished yesterday when the senior
Republican on the Senate judiciary committee stated flatly that she should
be confirmed in office.
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said controversy about her hiring of illegal
aliens, a Peruvian couple, for child care and housekeeping work, for which
she has paid back taxes and a civil penalty, in no way disqualified her from
the position.
In a statement after her prepared testimony, Ms Baird, who, at 40, would be
the first US woman attorney general, told the committee she had been wrong
to hire the couple.
Ms Baird was formally presented to the committee by her two home state
Democratic senators from Connecticut, Mr Christopher Dodd and Mr Joseph
Lieberman, and by the new senator from Washington, Ms Patty Murray.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, one of Washington's great power brokers and - along with Mr
Christopher, for whose law firm she once worked - a chief sponsor, sat just
behind her in support.
In her testimony, she said the Justice Department needed 'a deeper sense of
purpose' and had to be freed from 'inappropriate political intrusion'. She
cited Mr Edward Levy, attorney general in the Ford administration, as the
last exemplary chief law enforcement officer.
In another confirmation hearing yesterday, Mrs Hazel O'Leary, nominated as
energy secretary in the Clinton cabinet, predicted a grim future for the
nuclear power industry.
Although Mrs O'Leary has been working for a Minnesota utility which uses
nuclear power, she said that new nuclear plants were not economically
competitive, if the cost of construction were included.

THE Mexican government aims to wrap up its privatisation programme this year
by selling 37 more state companies, the Finance Ministry announced
yesterday.
The sales could raise Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn and, as with previous
privatisation receipts, most of the money will be used to retire public
debt. The administration of President Carlos Salinas has so far sold, or
closed down, 362 state-owned companies, for a total of 64.5bn pesos, or
around Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.4bn).
The government will sell off by March, in a single tranche, the state-run
television Channels 7 and 13, the national newspaper El Nacional, and
various cinemas. Its declared aim is to create a media company able to
compete with Televisa, Mexico's dominant entertainment group.
Televisa has interests ranging from television (90 per cent of the market),
to the Mexico City football team, video shops and record labels.
The government also hopes to sell Aseguradora Mexicana, the state-owned
insurance company, assets of the Fertimex fertiliser company, several
hotels, and concessions to run most of the main ports.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Fiscal changes tax new 'moral' congress: Positive vote is
essential to restore national credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER seven years of discussion and delay, the moment of truth arrives today
for Brazil's commitment to fiscal adjustment, when congress votes on higher
taxes to plug a Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.5bn) hole in this year's budget.
Long mooted as the key hurdle in overcoming the decade-long economic crisis,
the vote on fiscal reform is the first test of the parliamentary strength of
the new administration of President Itamar Franco.
Its outcome will also expose the ability of 503 congressmen to build on
their new 'moral' image, achieved through their recent impeachment of
President Fernando Collor, by rising above their own parochial interests for
once.
The measure is far from the full-blooded reform necessary to guarantee
sustainable budget balance. However, its approval is essential if the
government is to resurrect a lapsed accord with the International Monetary
Fund - talks on which are due to resume on February 9 - and thus restore
international credibility.
The Franco government is not the first to draw up fiscal reforms, but
previous efforts have always been stymied by the highly fragmented political
system, lack of will, and - since 1988 - an incredibly restrictive
constitution. However, Mr Paulo Haddad, the newly-appointed economy
minister, says the situation has now reached breaking point.
With the government projecting a primary or non-interest deficit of 2.3 per
cent of gross domestic product, he says there is no money to pay government
employees or pensions or undertake desperately needed investments such as
repairs to the country's highways, many of which have degenerated into
cart-tracks.
The main proposals to raise these funds are a 0.25 per cent tax on cheques,
estimated to bring in Dollars 7bn, a tax on selected products such as
drinks, fuel, cigarettes and telephone calls, and a tax on company assets.
Mr Franco has spent the past week negotiating with the presidents and
parliamentary leaders of the 19 parties represented in congress and the
governors of the 27 states. His self-effacing style and years of political
experience have brought him far closer than his high-handed predecessor to
clinching a deal.
But despite all the fanfare, Mr Carlos Langoni, economic professor at the
highly-regarded Getulio Vargas Institute in Rio de Janeiro, says the project
is 'merely a quick-fix solution not touching the structural problems'. What
the congress is debating is simply a tax-raising exercise on those already
paying, when the real problems are widespread evasion, a bankrupt social
security system and a blatantly unfair distribution of revenues between
central and local government, he says.
According to the tax authorities, only 7m out of an economically active
population of 61m people pay income tax, and last year's income tax revenues
of Dollars 35bn are thought to be only half those owed. This means that the
deficit could be solved just by cracking down on a third of the evasion.
But the proposals contain no provision for strengthening the tax collection
service other than authorising the Economy Ministry to lift banking secrecy
 -and that proposal is not expected to be passed.
On the expenditure side, the pivotal problem is the 1988 constitution, which
increased the proportion of revenue transferred to local government, without
also passing on the responsibilities of tax collection or provision of
services. The tax income of states and cities has risen from 8 to 12 per
cent of GDP under the new constitution, and Mr Collor frequently complained:
'The problems of this country will never be solved while for every four
cruzeiros the centre collects it only keeps one.'
As a result, for example, the federal hospital system has all but collapsed.
Moreover, while the federal government has cut its payroll expenditures,
those of local governments increased 77 per cent between 1985 and 1990.
Mr Rogerio Werneck, a fiscal expert, says: 'States and cities have been
spending way above their fast-growing revenues and have no incentive not to,
as they are always bailed out by the central bank.' With only three states
solvent, local governments now owe the federal government Dollars 49bn -
more than Brazil's debt to foreign commercial banks.
The structural reform to resolve this is not being tackled because
congressmen need state and municipal machinery for re-election and will not
vote for something that cuts at the root of support.
So the easy answer is to increase the taxes of those already paying. But
economists like congressman and former planning minister Antonio Delfim Neto
are sceptical about the wisdom of this when the economy is still in
recession: 'Any increase will result in real reduction of salaries and
increase in unemployment.'
He says the government should be concentrating on finding a solution for the
main cause of the overall deficit - the bonded domestic debt which
snowballed last year by a real 178 per cent to Cr12,400bn (Pounds 580m)
partly because of high real interest rates averaging 30 per cent.
Mr Neto suggests using foreign exchange reserves, which are at record levels
of Dollars 24bn, to buy back some of this debt (interest payments on which
swell the overall deficit to 6 per cent of GDP) and initiate a road
improvement programme. Then, he would wait until a constitutional review due
in September for profound structural reform.
The government has already obtained some fiscal relief through a new
corporate withholding tax on financial gains. Passed on Christmas Eve,
partly to encourage investment in productive, rather than speculative,
activity, this is expected to bring in Dollars 6bn, though it may be
challenged in court.
Many analysts yesterday feared congress would decide that this new tax
solved half the problem and the country could therefore muddle through
without the rest.
In fact, by international standards and excluding its growing interest bill,
Brazil's primary deficit is not that high. The real problem is confidence,
and fiscal reform has been talked about for so long that it has become the
sine qua non to restoring government credibility both at home and abroad.
Although Mr Haddad warns that 'Itamar can't do miracles', it would be ironic
if the president who cares the least about IMF recommendations of any recent
Brazilian leader were to come closest to fulfilling them.

<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government yesterday announced new privatisation rules. These
confirmed President Itamar Franco's direct command over the process and
barred state companies' pension funds from taking part, prompting investor
fears that the programme may cease to be viable.
The rules, in the form of a 63-part decree, establish Mr Franco as head of
the privatisation process with the right to intervene at any stage. He can
also decide on a case-by-case basis the level of participation of foreign
capital and 'rotten money' - domestic debt swapped at par, which has
accounted for 97 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised so far.
Announcing the changes, Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, said foreign
participation might be more than the current 40 per cent, and as much as 100
per cent, depending on the company.
However, the decision to disqualify the state company pension funds caused
concern among investors, who fear that without them there might not be
enough money in the economy to make the sell-offs feasible. The Sao Paulo
stock exchange index fell back from a 2 per cent rise to a 0.9 per cent loss
on the news.
The pension funds represent an investor potential of Dollars 25bn (Pounds
16.4bn), Mr Haddad says, and they have been the main participants in the
programme so far. For example, 95 per cent of rail carriage maker Mafersa
was bought by the federal railways pension fund.
Mr Francisco Baker, the presidential spokesman, said: 'Mr Franco feels that
the participation of parastatal pension funds benefits a very small group of
Brazilians and constitutes using state money to buy state companies.'
However, some investors suspect Mr Franco, a past critic of privatisation,
of trying to slow it down.
One foreign banker commented: 'There seems little doubt now that he is
trying to scupper the process.' The programme has been suspended since early
December, but Mr Franco has promised that it will resume in March.

ARGENTINA has again raised its official estimate for the 1992 trade deficit,
adding to concern about economic reforms.
The deficit is now put at up to Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn), against
Dollars 1.5bn before, according to planning secretary Juan Llach.
At the same time, unemployment and under-employment in October rose to 7 per
cent and 8.1 per cent respectively, against 6 and 7.9 per cent a year
earlier, the Indec statistics agency said. Independent researchers at the
UADE business school reported that workers' purchasing power fell 8 per cent
in December.
Mr Pedro Lacoste, an economic consultant, blames rapid economic change for
the apparent contradiction of a rising trade deficit and increasing
unemployment. Unreliable statistics worsen the confusion, he says.
He believes the employment data reflect a heavy shakeout in industry, as
companies struggle to boost productivity, and he expects inflation and the
trade deficit to fall sharply this year.
However, Mr Jose Luis Machinea, chief economist at the Union Industrial
Argentina, an employers' grouping, says the trade figures reflect low
productivity. 'Productivity growth has to be based on investments, but this
takes time. It will take four to five years to close our 15-20 per cent
productivity gap.'
Mr Machinea says the doubt is over how the ensuing trade deficit will be
financed and whether industry will invest sufficiently. He warns that
imports are replacing domestic production, while investment is insufficient
and is directed at service sectors, which do not generate hard currency.
The government, though, insists all is well. The Planning Secretariat says
the trade deficit may persist this year, but will then fall sharply.
Officials add that capital goods are a large component of imports.

One of Mexico's recently privatised companies, Aeromexico, has had its
apparently successful bid for AeroPeru contested by the Peruvian runner-up,
Naviera Santa. AeroMexico and a consortium of Peruvian investors bid Dollars
54m for 70 per cent of AeroPeru over the weekend, Dollars 8.7m more than
Naviera Santa.
Naviera claimed that the Mexican carrier controlled other members of the
consortium, and thus had broken the rule against foreign majority
acquisition.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: Dealers prepared to give
administration benefit of the doubt - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S inauguration marks the end of a transition period that has been
surprisingly smooth for Wall Street, considering that financial markets face
Democrat rule for the first time since Jimmy Carter's departure in 1980.
During the hiatus the markets have marked time, passing judgment on
President-elect Bill Clinton's cabinet appointments and speculating on
whether the new team has the guts to tackle the structural and financial
problems plaguing the economy.
Overall the transition period has had little effect on stockmarket,
sentiment and the main economic cabinet appointments were generally well
received.
Mr David Hale, chief economist with Kemper Securities, says: 'Wall Street
has been satisfied with the balance (of the Clinton cabinet) because it
suggests that fiscal policy will be cautious and guided by people with a
proven ability to work with Congress.'
As for economic policy, what little has been gleaned from the transition
period has been duly digested by the markets. But it was a modest meal.
That Mr Clinton has appeared to retreat from some of his campaign promises -
most notably to halve the deficit in four years and to cut middle-class
taxes - did not surprise anyone on Wall Street. During the election campaign
the Democrats were widely criticised because their numbers on boosting
economic growth by increasing spending and cutting taxes, while
simultaneously reducing the deficit, never added up. As Mr Robert Brusca,
chief economist with Nikko Securities in New York, put it: Mr Clinton wants
to 'have his cake, eat it, and lose weight too'.
The gap between election and inauguration, however, has created a few
problems for Wall Street, not least for the bond market. Having enjoyed an
unexpected post-election boom - since November the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond has dropped more than 30 basis points to just over 7.3 per cent
 -Treasury investors got the jitters early this month when the Clinton camp
warned that, because the projected budget shortfall for 1993 would be larger
than expected, deficit reduction measures could be put on hold.
The scare was enough to send long-term interest rates up to almost 7.5 per
cent. Since then long rates have crept down again, thanks in part to talk of
Democrats introducing a nationwide consumption tax.
Statements from key Clinton appointees stressing the importance of long-term
deficit reduction have also helped to calm the market, as have rumours that
the fiscal stimulus package introduced in the early days of the Clinton
campaign will be nothing like as large as the financial markets originally
feared back in October 1992, when worries about what the Democrats would do
when in power sent bond prices tumbling and long-term interest rates
soaring.
Only on Tuesday, bond prices rose sharply on reports that Mr Clinton had
outlined a plan to boost economic growth with a programme of Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 13.1bn) in tax cuts and spending increases that, although widening
the budget deficit in the short run, would soon be followed by the
introduction of a broad-based energy tax that would take a large chunk out
of the deficit over the longer term.
Treasury investors, however, remain wary of the new administration and will
be Mr Clinton's toughest critics in his first few months as president.
In effect the bond market will be expecting the worst from Mr Clinton in his
first year. This means that if he behaves like a typical Democratic
president, remains beholden to Congress and political special interests, and
does nothing serious to tackle the budget deficit, Treasury investors will
not be surprised. As Mr Jeff Thredgold, chief economist for the New York
banking group KeyCorp, says: 'To the markets Mr Clinton is presumed guilty
until found innocent.'
The key feature of the transition period has been the performance of the
economy, which in the past few months has shown signs that it will post
solid, if unspectacular, low-inflation growth during 1993. It has been the
brightening economic picture that, more than anything, has made the
financial markets' pre-inauguration 'honeymoon' with Mr Clinton relatively
trouble-free.
While keeping an eye on the incoming administration, financial markets have
also been bracing for news of last year's fourth-quarter earnings.
'Results are likely to disappoint,' warns Mr Eric Miller, chief investment
officer at brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who forecasts
aggregate operating earning gains of 10-15 per cent. With the first batch of
quarterly earnings reports in, Mr Miller's forecast looks about right.
Over the longer term the outlook for earnings is more positive. A recently
completed survey of medium-sized companies by the American Stock Exchange
found that 85 per cent of chief executives expected higher revenues this
year. While that confidence is not so noticeable at the big industrial
companies, whose earnings are more exposed to weakening overseas economies,
there is little doubt corporate earnings are on an upward trend.
Ultimately, how the markets take to President Clinton will depend on whether
he can, as promised, lay the foundations for sustained economic growth
without letting the budget deficit balloon further.
Wall Street is still giving Mr Clinton the benefit of the doubt, although
some expectations are unsustainably high.
Mr Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann, wrote this week:
'Perhaps Bill Clinton, a liberal Democrat, will fulfil Ronald Reagan's
formula for growth - work, save and invest. If (he) sticks to his game plan,
investors should do well.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: Clinton names 13 top officers -
Appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST 24 hours before becoming US president, Mr Bill Clinton yesterday
announced 13 senior State Department appointments, thus deflecting criticism
that his new government is unprepared to run the country.
His aides said yesterday that as many as 100 sub-cabinet level appointments
throughout the administration could be made this week. Some senior
Republican appointees are also being either asked to stay on for specific
interim tasks or retained as consultants.
The State Department list contains a number of former and career foreign
service officers but few surprises. The position of undersecretary for
political affairs goes to Mr Peter Tarnoff, who served in the Carter
administration and now works with the Council on Foreign Relations in New
York.
Mr Tim Wirth, the former senator from Colorado, gets a new role as
counsellor to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, with special
responsibility for a grab-bag of issues, including the environment, science
and technology, human rights, refugees and narcotics.
Among the more significant regional nominations is that of Mr Winston Lord,
a Republican and 1985-89 ambassador to Beijing, to be assistant secretary
for east Asian and Pacific affairs, a brief that includes China.
Mr Strobe Talbott, a Time magazine journalist and Oxford classmate of Mr
Clinton, becomes ambassador-at-large handling matters connected with the
former Soviet Union, an appointment meant pto give a higher profile to
relations with Russia and other former Soviet republics.
Other appointments, all of which require Senate confirmation, include: Mrs
Harriet Babbitt, wife of the interior secretary-designate, as ambassador to
the Organisation of American States; Ms Lynn Davis, an arms control expert
in the Carter administration and now with the Rand think-tank, as
undersecretary for international security affairs; and Ms Joan Spero, an
economist with American Express, who gets the international economics
portfolio.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: The activist generation awaits
rallying call - President's inaugural address must awaken a nationwide
commitment to make America a better place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN inauguration is the ultimate American political rite of passage, intended
to set the tone for the presidency to come. Sometimes it does, sometimes it
does not.
The most memorable inaugural addresses are the stuff of history. George
Washington's first was held in New York and still holds the record for
brevity - 143 words. William Henry Harrison's in 1841 was the longest at 105
minutes. He caught pneumonia in the freezing cold and died just over a month
later.
Although selections are invidious, four addresses are generally accorded a
special place. Abraham Lincoln's in 1861, delivered to a nation in civil
war, was perhaps the finest exercise in inaugural oratory, exceeded only
marginally by his Gettysburg speech four years later. President-elect Bill
Clinton had no trouble quoting Mr Lincoln on Sunday night when he called on
the 'better angels of our nature' to guide his presidency.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's stirring commitment in 1933 to drag the country
out of the Depression was captured on nationwide radio and newsreel and
offered hope amid desolation.
'This nation asks for action and action now. . . we must act and act
quickly,' might not have a Lincolnesque ring but the words were precisely
what was wanted.
John Kennedy's generational call to arms - 'ask not what your country can do
for you but what you can do for your country' - held out similar promise,
although, unlike FDR's, it was not fulfilled in his brief term.
In 1981 Ronald Reagan switched the site of the inaugural address to the
west-facing steps of the Capitol, a neat symbol for a Californian. He then
declared that government had grown too big and would be cut down to size.
His administration proceeded to do what he had pledged.
His second inaugural was also prescient. It was held indoors because of the
ferocious cold and, although his second four years can be said to have
presaged the end of the cold war, they were also marked for some dubious
policies (such as Iran-Contra) that were never designed to see the light of
day.
Promise, however, often falls short. It was, after all, President Kennedy
who started the long, slippery slide into the Vietnam war and the death of
57,000 young Americans, a disproportionate number black. This, presumably,
was not the fate he had in mind when he asked them to 'bear any burden' so
that liberty might prevail.
In 1977 Jimmy Carter charmed the country with a thoughtful speech about the
inter-dependent world and by becoming the first to walk the length of
Pennsylvania Avenue hand in hand with his wife. Four years later, his
reflections seen as indecisive and the millstone of the hostages in Iran
round his neck, he was gone.
George Bush in 1989 said he would transform the Reagan legacy into 'a
kinder, gentler America' and a lot of people thought he had struck just the
right note. Today he goes back to Texas as a private citizen because his
countrymen concluded he had no idea how to make it so.
It is traditional now that every inaugural speech has grace notes, such as
Mr Carter complimenting Gerald Ford for all he had done to 'heal our
country' and Mr Reagan, less probably, being equally generous to Mr Carter.
Mr Clinton will have nice things to say about George Bush, because it is now
accepted and because he is a good charitable Christian.
It was not always thus: John Adams refused to attend Thomas Jefferson's
inaugural (the election had been determined, perhaps by connivance, in the
House of Representatives) while Herbert Hoover could barely bring himself to
look at FDR as they rode to the Capitol together.
Mr Clinton, who is a keen student of past presidents, has adopted a
quintessentially eclectic approach to his inaugural. This ranges from the
Jeffersonian ride from Monticello, through the extravaganza that marked the
advent of Kennedy and the populist themes so dear to Carter, to tomorrow's
open day at the White House.
This, however, will be by invitation only, perhaps because Mr Clinton delved
into what happened when Andrew Jackson opened the White House up to his
friends in 1829. They muddied the carpets and broke the furniture and
Jackson had to escape through a back window.
Mr Clinton will also strive for a distinctive note. He may not be the
youngest president, a honour belonging to Teddy Roosevelt, but, even more
than Kennedy, he is the representative of a different and younger
generation. This is a generation born after the last world war and not
tempered much, Vietnam apart, by conflict.
For many, opposition to that war was the common denominator. But in an age
deprived of the overweening cold war, yet consumed by so many independent
flashpoints, the 'old' qualifications, including military service, are no
longer deemed pre-eminent.
Many Americans of his age, though fired by the social and political activism
of the 1960s, subsequently dropped out or got law degrees, became affluent
and are now universally known as 'baby boomers' and 'yuppies'. But Mr
Clinton, though a lawyer, stayed in government and pushed for change.
His inaugural, like the better parts of his campaign, must be designed to
reawaken that activist commitment to make the nation a better place, now
stirring after a long sleep. The metaphors he chooses will be unwrapped
today, the promises offered to a hungry nation. There will be for a while a
positive national desire for him to succeed. The tough part, as ever, is
preserving that goodwill when the fires of the inauguration are but embers.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: Reform is vital to health of the
economy - Healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF Mr Bill Clinton's dozens of pledges made during last year's campaign, the
one that arguably matters most was a promise to reform the healthcare
system. His performance here may decide the success or failure of his
presidency.
Healthcare matters for its own sake. About 33m Americans (more than the
population of California) are currently without insurance. At a minimum Mr
Clinton must sharply reduce infant mortality rates (at present among the
highest in developed countries) and increase the miserably low proportion of
inner-city children being immunised against common diseases.
But healthcare is more than the most pressing social problem. The
extraordinary escalation of costs - what the OECD calls the 'worsening
paradox of excess and deprivation' has turned healthcare into one of the
US's most intractable economic problems.
For three decades, healthcare spending has grown at an annual rate of 6 per
cent in real terms, more than doubling its share of gross domestic product
to about 14 per cent, far above the international norm of about 8 per cent.
The galloping inflation of health costs is putting intolerable strains on
state and federal budgets. Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the
public sector programmes for the elderly and the poor, is expected to rise
by 87 per cent over the next five years to Dollars 392bn (Pounds 258bn),
thus accounting for half of the total projected increase in federal outlays.
It will be impossible to reduce the Dollars 300bn budget deficit
significantly unless health care spending can be brought under control.
And if the deficit is not reduced, there is little hope of raising savings
and investment rates, which are among the lowest in the industrialised
world. Yet in the longer term, the rate of economic growth can be raised
only by increasing savings and investment. Mr Clinton's hopes of improving
the living standards of the 'forgotten middle class' thus depend on the
successful reform of healthcare.
There is also a 'micro-economic' link between healthcare and economic
performance. Mr Clinton has hinted he may experiment with a European-style
'industrial policy' as a means of improving the US competitiveness. Yet as
Mr Henry Poling, chairman of Ford Motor, told him at last month's economic
conference in Little Rock, the quickest way to help many businesses would be
to lift the crippling burden imposed by their healthcare obligations to
employees and pensioners - a burden without parallel in other industrial
countries.
Ford's healthcare costs have tripled as a percentage of payroll from 6 per
cent in 1970 to nearly 20 per cent today. It spends as much on medical care
as on steel.
The US faces more intractable problems than other countries for two main
reasons. In the first place, it relies on employers as the principal (yet
voluntary) source of health insurance for the non-elderly population. Since
increasing numbers of small and medium-sized companies are unable to afford
the cost of insurance premiums, this, in effect, guarantees gaps in
healthcare coverage. Four-fifths of uninsured Americans are employed or
dependents of employees.
The other unique characteristic of US healthcare is the dogged belief that
costs can somehow be controlled by normal 'market forces'. In every other
advanced country, the government has stepped into the health market, either
to set an overall expenditure limit (as in Britain's National Health
Service) or to regulate the volume and price of services that doctors and
hospitals can charge. In the US such controls are being imposed on Medicare
and Medicaid spending, but this accounts for only about 40 per cent of the
market.
Ms Donna Shalala, the university administrator named as health secretary,
has signalled that the incoming administration intends to tackle both of
these fundamental problems. She wants to set a national budget for both
public and private health care spending. At the same time, gaps in coverage
would be plugged by introducing a form of 'managed competition'. Everybody -
uninsured individuals as well as members of corporate plans - would be
enrolled in regional healthcare purchasing co-operatives which would buy
care from competing providers in the private sector. In theory, the
co-operatives' market clout will ensure that members receive high-quality
care at the lowest possible price.
The managed competition route looks promising. But efforts to control costs
will succeed only if strict limits are set on the use of expensive new
technology and drugs, on the prospective incomes of physicians (which are
far higher than in other countries) and on the hugely inefficient private
insurance industry. Yet this requires a direct confrontation will some of
the nation's most powerful interest groups.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: The new president and his team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton promised to form a cabinet 'more like America' in its
diversity: except for the preponderance of lawyers, he has probably
succeeded. It contains many, like Mr Clinton himself, with minimal
Washington experience, interspersed with capital veterans. Mr Clinton has
set up the cabinet so that he runs it 'top down,' relying on the quality of
ideas sent to him, but making many of the final decisions himself. He
rejects the traditional notion that the secretaries of state, defence,
treasury and justice outrank all others, and his cabinet is not designed to
foster independent baronies. However, the Aspin-Woolsey security combination
looks distinctive: so does the Vice-President Gore-Babbitt-Browner alliance
on the environment, Panetta-Alice Rivlin on the budget and Lake-Sandy Berger
at the National Security Council. Many important sub-cabinet level
appointments have yet to be announced. The overriding first order of
business is to come up with a domestic economy blueprint, to be wrapped into
a State of the Union message by mid-March at the latest and include
investment incentives, deficit reduction and healthcare reform. Even before
then, a series of foreign policy exigencies will require attention.
Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, 67: promised in his confirmation hearings to travel less
than James Baker and to be in charge of the 'American desk' at the State
Department, connecting domestic and foreign policy. Considered the
quintessential lawyer-negotiator, without pronounced ideology. Believes US
embassies should offer more help to US commercial interests. Strong on human
rights. Thinks failure of Russian reforms could be catastrophic for
democracy.
Secretary of the Treasury
Lloyd Bentsen, 71: smooth as old bourbon but with some of its bite. Skilled
legislator, especially on tax policy, his principal role will be to get
Clinton's economic proposals through Congress. Thinks the greatest US
problems are the budget deficit and under-savings. Does not rule out higher
petrol taxes. Wants the Group of Seven industralised countries to get back
to its roots and focus on economic growth policies, initially through
frequent informal meetings.
Attorney General
Zoe Baird, 40: first-ever woman attorney general, one of the youngest and,
at the outset, one of the least political. Corporate lawyer with no trial
experience but rated one of the brightest of her generation. Inherits a
troubled department with lots of outstanding controversial business (BNL,
BCCI, Inslaw, Iraqgate, residues of the Iran-Contra affair). May have to
excuse herself from involvement in some healthcare decisions because of
business connections.
Secretary of Defence
Les Aspin, 54: dove-turned-semihawk and pungent defence expert. More
interventionist than most recent defence secretaries, which could put him at
odds with military top brass like General Colin Powell. Faces tough job in
cutting defence budget by dollars 60bn while maintaining US technological
edge. Has said US might have to intervene in Bosnia. Likely to form strong
partnership with Jim Woolsey at the CIA.
Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt, 54: an intellectual wild card in the pack, the former
governor of Arizona only conforms to interior secretary type by coming from
the west. With Vice-President Al Gore and Carol Browner at the Environmental
Protection Agency, will be the chief 'green' in the cabinet and expected to
reverse policies considered too friendly to natural-resource industries.
Could pull surprises, however, as his career has often been politically
unorthodox.
White House Chief of Staff
Thomas (Mack) McLarty, 46: an Arkansas businessman who is an unknown
commodity as White House chief of staff. His 40-year relationship with his
president and his new role as gatekeeper make him a power. Unlikely to
maintain a high Washington public profile. Said to be gracious and polite.
Conflicting reports about his organisational skills. Will have to learn fast
on the job.

FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit by big rights issue
fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHISPER around the market of an imminent Pounds 500m-plus rights issue,
and the prospect of a February loaded with cash calls, put the seal on a
generally dismal trading session in the UK equity market, which posted its
10th fall in eleven trading sessions.
Earlier, the market had weakened progressively after a succession of bearish
news items, notably a gloomy survey from the Confederation of British
Industry, news on December public sector borrowing, and stories that Germany
might impose a tax on overseas investment. Continuing unease over the chance
of an escalation of conflict in the Gulf, and a series of earnings
downgrades of leading stocks also damaged confidence.
Meanwhile, details of the Government Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction prompted a
more relaxed attitude in that market.
Technical analysts added to the mood of uneasiness in the market saying the
FT-SE 100 had gone below its 30-day moving average.
The market opened on an easier note, with marketmakers chopping opening
levels after the disappointing CBI survey for December which questioned
recent hopes of a recovery in consumer spending. A further pointer to the
level of pre-Christmas spending will come this morning when official figures
for retail sales are announced. Economists expect a year-on-year increase of
2 per cent in sales figures.
A brief rally ensued, but proved short-lived. The pressure on the market
increased, with the Footsie future, which traded at a discount to cash all
day, leading the way lower.
The 100 index, after rallying to show a fall of only 3.8 mid-morning
gradually subsided and began to fall sharply as hints of a big rights issue
swept the market. The most surprising among a host of names put forward as
candidates to raise cash was Glaxo. The suggestion was that the group could
be about to make an acquisition. Redland, the building materials group, was
also mentioned as were the composite insurers where Royals was seen as the
most likely to call on shareholders.
At its worst, the FT-SE 100 showed a loss of 27.2 at 2,735.9, but later
stabilised to end a volatile and uncomfortable session 25.5 lower at
2,737.6. The Footsie Mid 250 also lost ground but outperformed the 100
index, closing 9.8 off at 2,885.9.
An additional factor for the market was the disappointing level of business
this week. Yesterday's turnover of 557m shares, although well up on Monday's
488m, was viewed as unsatisfactory. The value of equity business on Monday
was Pounds 899.5m, the first time it has dropped below Pounds 1bn since the
start of the year.
From today, earnings yields and price:earnings ratios are shown for the Life
Insurance, Composite Insurance and Merchant Bank sectors of the FT-Actuaries
All-Share Index. The effect is to lower slightly the earnings yield and P/E
figures shown for the FT-SE 100, FT-SE Mid 250 and FT-SE Actuaries 350.
Where heavy losses from some companies would distort the P/E ratio, a
maximum published figure of 80 will be shown. For the Composite Insurance
sector, both figures are at present negative. Earnings yields and P/E ratios
for the Investment Trust sector and for the FT-A All-Share Index will be
shown from next Tuesday, January 26.

FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a volatile session with the day dominated by the
negative CBI distributive trades survey for December and talk of a big
rights issue in the equity market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Sellers were seen at the start of trading in the March contract on the FT-SE
which opened at 2,767 and within an hour of the opening the contract had
fallen to 2,755, as economic worries following the CBI report dominated the
market. The falls in the future led the underlying equity market lower.
Bargain hunting led to a recovery in both markets, and March reached the
day's high of 2,775 shortly after 11pm and remained at the higher levels
though on thin trading for the next few hours. The tentative early
performance on Wall Street led to another retreat in the contract to 2,743
once again draging the cash market with it.
March closed at 2,745, down 24 on the previous close and around its fair
value premium to cash of about 8. turnover remained low at 7,671. Turnover
in the traded options improved on Monday's level reaching 26,797 lots. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 12,882 contracts, and the Euro FT-SE 1,113 lots.
Business among the stock options was poor with British Airways, the most
actively dealt stock option trading a mere 965 contracts. This was followed
by ICI at 842 lots and by Ladbrokes at 806.

FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling boost for Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome bucked the market's desultory trend yesterday
after the company reassured analysts about prospects in a series of
one-to-one presentations. The shift in the value of sterling and the dollar
after Black Wednesday on September 16 will help profits.
A number of specialists left the meetings to upgrade their forecasts. Among
them was Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon who raised his profit forecast
from the 'low 600s' to Pounds 670m for 1993, believed to be around the top
end of the range. The stock jumped 20 in early trade but the shine was taken
off its performance later by the sharp slide in the market and the sale of a
large line of stock. Dealers said NatWest Securities was selling a block of
2m shares at 915p and, although the selling was easily absorbed, Wellcome's
gains were trimmed to a net rise of 2 at 914p. Turnover was heavy at 5.1m
shares.
Cellular worries
Shares in the cellular telephone operators came off sharply amid speculation
that their call rates might be heavily undercut by a new agreement between
BT and Personal Communications Network (PCN) operators - the new rivals to
cellular. Market sources suggested that the new PCN interconnect rates would
be only marginally above present BT landcall rates - around 10p per minute -
compared with the rates paid by the cellular groups Vodafone and Cellnet, of
around 33p per minute. If true, the agreement could impact on the cellular
groups' earnings. They have both recently launched a new package of rates
designed to attract new customers in advance of the PCN launch, expected
this summer. Yesterday, BT, co-owner of Cellnet, retreated 6 1/2 to 377 1/2
p, Vodafone 12 to 407p, while Cable &amp; Wireless, the majority owner of PCN
operator Mercury, fell 3 to 708p.
Meanwhile, BT was the subject of revived talk that it would spend the
proceeds of its sale of McCaw to buy into MCI, one of the US's leading
long-distance telecoms groups. BT made Pounds 1.8bn from the McCaw deal
which would buy it a 10-15 per cent stake in MCI.
Glaxo retreats
A sharp slide in Glaxo took the market by surprise yesterday. In spite of
stories ranging from impending rights issues to worries about drugs, the
bottom line appeared to be a continuing shift away from the stock in the US.
The growing US concern was highlighted by the selling of 650,000 American
Depositary Receipts, equivalent to 1.3m shares at Dollars 21.50 or around
700p. Dealers said the stock was now testing chart levels on both sides of
the Atlantic.
There was further concern following a television programme on Monday night
which was critical of Glaxo's Myodil drug and some suggestions, generally
discounted, that Glaxo might be considering a rights issue. The company has
signalled its interest in making an acquisition in the OTC market (over the
counter drugs) but analysts say the company has a cash pile of around Pounds
1.5bn and would be able to avoid a cash call. Finally, Smith New Court cut
its 1993 forecast by Pounds 75m to Pounds 1660m and its 1994 numbers by
Pounds 70m to Pounds 1900m. However, Smiths argue that they are merely
bringing their numbers in line with the market consensus.
Taiwan cheers BAe
Turnover in British Aerospace rose sharply to 8.4m, making it the day's most
actively traded stock as the market greeted with relief confirmation of the
long awaited deal with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture regional jets.
Analysts said the deal meant the company would not have to close the
Woodford assembly plant, brought cash to BAe, enhanced the residual value of
the 146 aircraft, and gave it access to a fast growing market.
Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite, one of the leading enthusiasts of
the stock, said the deal was 'a major achievement for the new management'.
He raised his end of year prediction of the share price from 250p to 300p.
The team at Smith New Court, though appreciative of the deal, said: 'The
share price is likely to pause until developments on Al-Yamamah 2 become
clearer.' The shares closed 9 up at 194p.
Ladbroke boosted
News that the government is to extend betting shop opening hours during the
summer to 10pm helped shares in Ladbroke rally after weak trading for most
of the day. Analysts said the development could add up to Pounds 5m to the
group's pre-tax profits and should give a strong boost to the shares. After
declining in early trading, they recovered to close steady at 189p
yesterday. Other betting groups also benefitted. Bass, off 15 at one stage,
rallied to close 9 adrift at 579p. Brent Walker jumped 1 1/2 to 8 3/4 p.
Recent takeover talk surrounding Higgs and Hill came to a head with the sale
by Berkeley Group of its 0.7 per cent stake in its fellow construction
group. Berkeley began building its stake earlier this month and Higgs claims
that its request for the company's intentions to be qualified were not
satisfied, with Berkeley saying it intended to add to its holding, according
to Higgs. Berkeley was served with a 212 notice and then sold its stake, the
shares being immediately picked up by institutions yesterday after advancing
strongly during early trading. They closed 6 ahead at 49p with turnover of
2.3m. Berkeley added 4 to 318p.
Berkeley says it brought the stake recently as a trading investment and that
its sale yesterday was not prompted by the 212 notice. There was some talk
in the market that Berkeley may have been interested in buying Higgs'
housebuilding business and using its stakebuilding as a lever. Higgs
strongly denied it had held any disposal talks with Berkeley. However, more
cynical analysts speculated that Berkeley had a reputation for lucrative
trading investments, hence institutions willingness to buy the stock once it
came into the market.
Restructuring at Xerox helped Rank Organisation, the shares leaping 7 to
701p. Thorn EMI was worried by a downgrade from Credit Lyonnais Laing and
also talk of a litigation trial due to begin next month in the US. The
shares lost 15 to 843p.
A weak brewers sector was cheered by news that the government was not
ordering an investigation into the industry. Scottish and Newcastle added 3
to 444p and Grand Metropolitan 6 to 426p.
SmithKline Beecham attracted heavy buying which resulted in turnover of 4.3m
in the 'A's (up a penny at 478p) and 5.3m in the Units (2 1/2 better at
417p).
Shell Transport slid 8 1/2 to 517 1/2 p as the Dutch arm predicted poor 1992
results from its refining and chemicals activities.
Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi saw healthy turnover after one house
took on a block of 1.5m shares at 168p and sold them at 168 1/2 p. Agency
broker James Capel was a likely candidate as it is worried about the group's
performance in the US and preparing to cut forecasts for the year.
Recently-merged television station Yorkshire-Tyne Tees lifted 8 to 144p on
raised full-year profits of Pounds 16.1m. However, James Capel is a seller
arguing that the full impact of the company's Pounds 52m franchise bid has
yet to hit the bottom line. Analyst Mr Guy Lamming said; 'They will have to
run very quickly just to stand still.'
Broadcasting group Carlton Communications added 5 at 815p mainly due to a
stock shortage in thin trading conditions.
Good demand for Rolls-Royce led to a squeeze. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 116
1/2 p, on turnover of 4.6m.
Bid speculation returned to APV and the shares hardened 5 to 124p.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shrugs off IBM but down
in late selling
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US stock markets shrugged off news of a big fourth quarter loss at
IBM, a burst of late selling left share prices lower across the board,
despite a rally in bond prices and strong bank earnings, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18.92 at 3,255.99,
near its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished down 1.70 at 435.14, while the Amex composite ended 0.05 firmer at
403.84, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.32 at 696.81. Trading volume on the
New York SE was 285m shares.
In the absence of fresh economic statistics, the attention of investors was
focussed on corporate earnings and the crisis in the Middle East. News of US
air attacks on Iraqi defence installationsagain cast a cloud over the
market, which remains fearful that the conflict in the Gulf could escalate,
pushing up oil prices, depressing consumer confidence and dampening optimism
about the arrival in office of President Clinton.
On the corporate front, IBM stole the headlines, reporting a loss in the
fourth quarter of Dollars 5.5bn, or Dollars 9.57 a share. Although the
figures were within market expectations, a growing number of analysts at the
start of the week had been hoping that IBM would pleasantly surprise the
market with a smaller-than-expected loss.
The market's initial reaction to the figures was to sell IBM heavily,
pushing the stock down more than Dollars 2 to a low of Dollars 47 1/4 ,
before a few buyers moved in to bring the price back to Dollars 48 3/8 ,
showing a net decline of Dollars 1 1/8 . Just over 4m shares changed hands
during the session.
Bank stocks were also in the limelight, rising on a succession of earnings
reports which confirmed that the sector's recovery from recent problems is
continuing apace. Wells Fargo led the way, jumping Dollars 13 to Dollars 99
on the news that the West Coast banking group had rebounded from a loss a
year ago to post an 83 cents-a-share profit in the latest quarter.
Also firmer were Citicorp, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 24 1/2 and aided by a
ratings upgrade from Standard &amp; Poors, Chemical, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
41 5/8 , Banc One, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 52 1/2 , and BankAmerica,
Dollars 3 7/8 higher at Dollars 53 3/8 .
Motor stocks rose on ratings upgrade from broking house Bear Stearns.
Chrysler put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 38 1/2 , Ford added Dollars 7/8 at
Dollars 47 3/8 and General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
PaineWebber fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 after the Wall Street
securities house disappointed those investors who had expected the company
to surprise the market with even stronger earnings than the Dollars 41.4m
reported in the fourth quarter.
Eastman Kodak rallied from recent weakness, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
49 1/2 in volume of 5.1m shares after the company said it would cut 2,000
jobs as part of a major cost-cutting effort.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices slipped for the second straight session in heavy
trading.
The 300-stock composite index retreated 7.51 points, or 0.23 per cent , to
end the session at 3,288.08, with declining issues leading advances 339 to
277. Volume climbed to 55.46m shares valued at CDollars 544m compared with
Monday's 36.04m shares valued at CDollars 305m.
Bank stocks and mining stocks showed the largest declines among the
subgroups, both losing 0.6 per cent.
Alcan reported increased fourth-quarter losses, largely due to higher
non-recurring charges. The stock was off  3/8 to 22 3/8 .

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent subdued as hopes of
rate cut recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY was generally subdued yesterday as hopes of a cut in interest rates
receded, writes our markets staff.
FRANKFURT continued to improve but some traders commented that the momentum
was decreasing with hopes fading for a cut in interest rates at tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting. The DAX index gained 5.70 to 1,578.83 but off
the day's high of 1,585.44 as turnover rose to DM6.2bn from Monday's
DM5.2bn.
With most stocks showing gains Schering disappointed with a DM28 fall to
DM707 after some brokers issued sell recommendations and lowered 1992 EPS
forecasts below DM40 from around DM42. Disappointing fourth quarter sales in
the agrochemical division will affect earnings, brokers say.
Thyssen was another loser, down DM3 at DM169.70, after the steel division
reported lower earnings for the year ending September 1992.
In the car sector Volkswagen slipped DM5.50 to DM270.50 in spite of improved
December sales figures as a number of analysts still consider that the
group's recent cost cutting measures do not go far enough. BMW advanced
DM10.50 to DM509.50 on a 7 per cent rise in December sales.
ZURICH ended easier but above the day's lows after a session dominated by a
German television report that a research institute had found minute
particles of asbestos in two drugs produced by Roche. The Roche certificates
ended SFr110 down at SFr4,120 after trading as low as SFr4,000.
The SMI index finished 20.7 lower at 2,063.9.
Among other actively traded issues, Alusuisse registered shares put on SFr7
to SFr440 in response to the company's plans to close Switzerland's last
aluminium smelter as part of a restructuring forced by overcapacity in the
world aluminium industry
PARIS was subdued and the CAC-40 index finished 0.20 ahead at 1,837.74, off
the day's high of 1,840.44. Turnover slipped to FFr2.3bn from FFr2.8bn.
BSN rose FFr6 to FFr914 after news that it was to co-operate with Unilever
in the development of new yoghurt and ice cream products.
AMSTERDAM lost a little ground as the CBS Tendency index fell 0.1 to 98.3.
Philips went against the trend with a 90 cents rise to Fl 22.60 after
reporting that its US lighting division had made its first operating profit
in eight years in 1992. Royal Dutch lost Fl 1.80 to Fl 143.90 after the
group forecast disappointing 1992 earnings.
MILAN closed off the session highs as domestic institutions began to take
profits. Foreign interest was also muted and the Comit index registered a
3.03 rise to 487.96.
Shares in Gemina, a financial holding company with links to Fiat, was a
strong performer, adding L65 to L1,275 before retreating to L1,245 in
after-hours trading.
MADRID eased on profit-taking after recent gains and the general index
closed 0.51 lower at 229.57.
BRUSSELS was supported by Tractebel, up BFr160 or 2 per cent to BFr8,010, as
the Bel-20 index put on 5.08 to 1,145.67 in turnover of BFr1.1bn.
STOCKHOLM finished little changed after a dull session which saw the
Affarsvarlden index edge up 1.0 to 934.8 in moderate turnover of SKr639m.
Bank shares turned back after three straight sessions of strong advances.
OSLO saw slight gains but activity remained subdued and the all-share index
put on 1.49 to 386.52 in turnover of NKr152.6m. Norsk Hydro added NKr2 to
Nkr163 while Saga Petroleum free shares lost NKr2 to NKr69.
COPENHAGEN advanced further with the KFX index gaining 1.53 to 81.16 in
solid turnover of some DKr1bn.
VIENNA was encouraged by neighbouring markets and the ATX index rose 11.56
to 730.64. Austrian Airlines gained Sch36 to Sch1,455 on unsubstantiated
reports that it was seeking a cut back in staff salaries.
ISTANBUL weakened with the 75-share market index closing down 20.92 at
3,996.24 in turnover of some TL175.5bn. Eregli shed TL150 to TL2,275.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore equities show signs of
revival - Hopes of economic recovery have given the market a boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Chinese new year this weekend and Singapore brokers are hoping for big
things from the Year of the Rooster after the Straits Times industrial index
of 30 blue chip stocks reached an 18-month high of 1,577 this week.
Only a few weeks ago it was hard to find a content broker in Singapore but
things have changed with speculation that the market could break its all
time high of 1,607 - achieved in early 1990 - within a few weeks. The index
eased slightly yesterday to close down 3.98 at 1,573.02.
For much of last year Singapore was in the doldrums, overshadowed by a rapid
surge in the Hong Kong market and more exciting prospects offered by Kuala
Lumpur and Bangkok. Lower than expected second quarter domestic growth
figures of 4.7 per cent caused nervousness about trading prospects, with
recession or economic slowdown affecting all its main export markets.
By mid year the market had fallen nearly 12 per cent, with the index at one
point touching the psychologically damaging 1,300 level.
But then the turnaround happened: signs began to emerge that the economy was
reviving; overall trade was picking up sharply, particularly in the vital
electronics sector; and November non-oil domestic exports rocketed by 29 per
cent.
At the same time Governor Chris Patten's argument with China over political
reforms for Hong Kong was causing a withdrawal of funds. Singapore, with its
reputation as a safe, if somewhat uninteresting, market was felt to be a
good port in stormy political times. By the end of December the STI was
trading 2.2 per cent up on the year and 16 per cent above its August low.
More good news on the domestic front came in the new year when the
government announced economic growth of 5.6 per cent in 1992, with higher
growth expected this year. It also said that in spite of generally gloomy
worldwide economic news in 1992 inward investments had reached a record
SDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.12bn) over the year.
'The economy now shows all the signs of being on a roll,' says Mr Paul
Schymyck of Hoare Govett, Singapore. 'Having survived what, in Singapore
terms, was a bad news patch early last year the fundamentals of the economy
now appear to be sound.'
One factor driving the market higher is the government's commitment to lower
both corporate and personal income taxes in the March budget , which is
likely to result in a boost in corporate earnings and provide a much needed
stimulus to the retail sector.
But Singapore is still a narrow market. Despite the rally late last year,
turnover shrank to 13.9bn shares worth SDollars 29.6bn in 1992 from 15.5bn
shares worth SDollars 30.5bn in 1991.
Singapore has also been overshadowed in recent months by Malaysia, which is
now twice as large in terms of market capitalisation, while Malaysian
shares, traded on Clob International, the over-the-counter market, now
account for about 30 per cent of volume.
Hungry investors want a more liquid, less regulated market, with more
companies allowed on to the board. The year's main excitement will be the
long delayed floatation of Singapore Telecommunications, the highly
profitable state telephone utility.
The government is expected to sell off a 25 per cent stake in the second
half with analysts valuing the company at up to SDollars 16bn. They say that
the floatation will give much needed breadth to a market overly dominated by
a small number of stocks.
The government, still a big force on the corporate scene, says that
companies must be more adventurous and expand overseas. Only by doing so, it
says, will Singapore remain competitive against more outward looking Hong
Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
In the short-term the risks associated with such expansion could disrupt the
steady profits growth blue chip investors have become accustomed to. But, in
the long-term, it could bring substantial benefits, as Singapore's cash rich
conglomerates use their resources to snap up opportunities in the world's
most dynamic economic region.

<TEXT>
TECHNICAL trading dominated activity yesterday, and share prices posted
moderate gains on arbitrage buying and small-lot purchases by public funds,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 181.40 at 16,798.64 having fallen to the day's
low of 16,645.23 in the first hour before advancing on constant
arbitrage-linked buying and hitting the day's high of 16,798.74 just before
the close.
Volume remained thin at 180m shares against 140m with dealers and public
fund managers being the only notable players as most large-lot investors
remained on the sidelines. Advances led declines by 638 to 254 with 202
issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 9 to 1,276.07 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.32 to
1,045.22.
Brokers said that most investors remained cautious over the future of the
economy while foreign investors have also been absent.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting drew heavy buying interest and gained Y10 to Y470
after the Metal Mining Agency of Japan confirmed the existance of a gold
vein discovered last year, in which the Mitsui has a major stake.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y44 to Y358 on active
buying.
Real estate issues advanced on rumours of government plans to ease its land
policy. Mitsui Fudosan gained Y10 to Y995 and Mitsubishi Estate rose Y10 to
Y915.
High-technology issues were higher on hopes of an early US economic revival.
Toshiba rose Y5 to Y612 and Sony Y80 to Y4,210. NEC jumped Y35 to Y665 on
reports that it would enter the personal computer price war by launching new
low priced models. Canon rose Y20 to Y1,370 after announcing a new 24-inch
liquid crystal display development.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 91.23 to 18,143.51 in volume of 71.7m
shares.
Roundup
THE region was mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG saw good foreign interest lift the Hang Seng index 15.88 to
5,897.90 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn.
Cathay Pacific put on 15 cents to HKDollars 9.40 in spite of the continuing
strike by flight attendants but Swire Pacific, the parent group, fell 75
cents to HKDollars 30.25.
HSBC Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 59.50.
AUSTRALIA saw a late burst of bargain hunting lift the market from its lows
and the All Ordinaries index finished 9.7 lower at 1,519.1 in turnover of
ADollars 221.97m.
The banking sector was active with 7.2m shares traded. Westpac lost 6 cents
to ADollars 2.79, after a low of ADollars 2.76, as investors registered
their disappointment that the bank did not appoint a new managing director
at the annual meeting.
In contrast, news that the Advance Bank had posted a 38 per cent rise in
half yearly net profit to ADollars 28.4m lifted its stock 26 cents to
ADollars 6.36.
TAIWAN rose in active trading after Premier Hau Pei-tsun agreed to resign
thereby helping to ease recent political tensions. The weighted index closed
up 63.82 or 1.9 per cent at 3,420.62. Turnover rose to TDollars 16.1bn
TDollars 12.3bn.
Cement and electronics shares were strong on institutional buying, with Acer
gaining TDollars 1.20 to TDollars 19.70.
JAKARTA was steady and volume returned to normal levels after Monday's heavy
trading in Astra International, when the Soeryadjaya family sold more than
100m of the shares to a 19-member consortium in a deal worth at least
Rp1000bn (Dollars 484m). The shares fell Rp100 to Rp9100.
The official index eased 0.79 to 277.15.
MANILA closed lower on the combined pressure of profit-taking and selling
influenced by a Dollars 2.50 slide to Dollars 32 1/8 by Philippine Long
Distance Telephone in overnight US trading.
The composite index lost 23.66 to 1,282.99.
A government order to break up PLDT's monopoly left investors uneasy and the
shares fell 45 pesos to 825 pesos.
SEOUL was firmer in relatively weak trading as the buying of
large-capitalisation shares gained momentum on the back of the government's
plan to lower interest rates.
The composite stock index ended 6.09 higher at 699.32 in turnover of
Won668.74bn compared with Monday's Won529.61bn.
KUALA LUMPUR fell marginally amid uncertainty over the proposed
constitutional amendments to limit the powers of the country's nine
hereditary rulers. The composite index closed 0.25 lower at 624.12 in volume
of 65.6m shares.
Multi-Purpose Holdings, which had gained on Monday on unsubstantiated
rumours that a Hong Kong company has obtained a gaming licence in China,
eased 6 cents to MDollars 1.77, off the day's high of MDollars 1.92.
BANGKOK saw the bank and finance sector lift the market as Thai Farmers Bank
announced higher 1992 earnings. The SET index gained 10.88 to 948.87 in
turnover of Bt7.5bn.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Debate about the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost another pfennig in European trading yesterday as dealers
continued to wonder whether the US currency's recent rally was sustainable,
writes James Blitz.
The dollar has lost more than four pfennigs since its close in London on
Friday night, and yesterday bottomed out at around DM1.6060 before closing
at DM1.6110 against the D-Mark.
There are certainly technical factors behind this latest fall, which follows
the sharp rise above DM1.55 at Christmas-time. A rise of that speed and
scale was always certain to be followed by some profit-taking.
However, there appears to be a growing feeling in the London market that
this new fall reflects a fundamental re-assessment of where the currency is
heading in the first quarter of this year.
Mr Mark Brett, a currency economist at BZW in London, is among those
analysts who believe that the sharp US economic recovery of recent months
cannot be sustained.
'Rather than being a period of accelerating US recovery, 1993 will be
another year of bursts of nothing happening,' he says.
Mr Brett believes that the economic recovery seen in last week's impressive
retail sales figures, which showed an 8 per cent rise from the previous
December, is unsustainable.
He points to the sharp drop in the savings ratio in the US, from 5 per cent
of gross income in the summer to 4 per cent last month, as a sign that
consumers are using savings rather than newly-generated money to buy goods.
This view is far from universally held. Mr Mark Slater, Managing Director of
foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International Bank in London, said
yesterday that the dollar was a little overbought, but predicted a dollar
rate of DM1.85 before the end of the first quarter.
He believes that German short term rates should be down by about 250 basis
points before the end of the third quarter, and that this is certain to
underpin the dollar. He also believes that the central banks have used up a
lot of their dollar reserves in recent months, buying the D-Mark for
dollars, in order to repay the Bundesbank for recent intervention.
The market's attention may now be on whether the dollar falls below the
significant technical support level of DM1.60. That is the average level of
the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate calculated over the last 30 days.
A chart line drawn between the two recent troughs for the dollar - DM1.39 in
October and DM1.55 in December - should show the currency at DM1.60 at the
present time.
A weak dollar might raise new tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism. But yesterday brought another day of consolidation, with Denmark
cutting interest rates by one percentage point, to 12 per cent, without this
weakening the krone.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Rates ease in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were new signs yesterday that European monetary policy is on the verge
of another ease, but dealers in cash and futures markets continued to view
interest rate movements with caution, writes James Blitz.
At the start of trading yesterday, the Bundesbank announced that it would be
holding a variable rate repo for 14 days in today's weekly intervention,
inviting bids from commercial banks for the allocation of funds.
With call money hovering yesterday at around 8.65 per cent, there was
speculation that the Bundesbank might today allocate funds at a level below
last week's fixed rate repo of 8.60 per cent.
Several arguments were marshalled in favour of the view that an ease in
German policy might come sooner than expected.
The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark this week has helped remove fears
of imported inflation that were haunting the Bundesbank.
Another sign of easier conditions was the decision by the Belgian and Dutch
central banks to ease their key interest rates by 10 basis points.
The Belgian national bank cut its central rate to 8.40 per cent, and the
Dutch authorities did the same to their special advances rate.
A senior dealer in one London bank recalled that Dutch rate moves could
sometimes indicate the Bundesbank's thinking on policy.
But the arguments against an easing in policy either at today's intervention
or this week's Bundesbank council meeting were very strong.
The Bundesbank's general council will probably await the outcome of
negotiations on the solidarity pact currently underway between the German
government, opposition, employers and trade unions, before taking a final
decision on rates.
Chancellor Kohl was due to announce the government's proposals late last
night, but a final resolution is unlikely until after Thursday's council
meeting.
Amidst these different pressures, the market came out slightly bearish.
Three month French francs firmed to 11 1/2 per cent from 11 1/4 per cent on
Monday.
The March French franc contract fell 14 basis points to close near its lows,
at 90.29.
In the sterling cash market, conditions were more difficult than they had
been on Monday, after the Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds
1.05bn. The overnight rate for lending pounds was quoted as high as 11 per
cent.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil and Colombia strike
agreement on coffee quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL AND Colombia, the world's leading coffee exporters, will take an
agreed set of target quotas for their shipments to the meeting of producer
countries starting today in London.
Brazil will propose that its quota be set at 27 per cent of the market,
while Colombia will seek 18 per cent, according to Mr Rubens Barbosa, a
Brazilian diplomat who is the lead negotiator for his country's delegation
to talks on the International Coffee Agreement. The quota targets are based
on exports in the two years to October 1992.
The preliminary meetings among producer countries are a prelude to formal
negotiations on the international accord set to reopen on February 1. At the
end of last year, negotiators resolved to extend the deadline for completion
of an accord to March 31.
The two countries determined their quota targets this week in Brasilia,
during meetings between Brazilian officials and Mr Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez,
head of Colombia's Federacafe. Representatives of the Brazilian Coffee
Committee, a private sector umbrella group, participated in the discussions.
Officials from the two countries reached a consensus about selectivity for
importers between different types of coffee - the lack of which was an
important factor in the collapse of the last quota agreement in July 1989.
Mr Barbosa declined to go into details, but said under the Brazil/Colombia
proposals selectivity would be structured around the main four types of
coffee. The rest, he said, 'is mechanics for the technicians to resolve'.
Brazilian and Colombian officials habitually meet prior to talks on the
accord in London. Mr Barbosa added that Brazil has held similar discussions
recently with Central American producers.
While producers appear to be forging a consensus, the position of consumers
remains in doubt because of the change in the American administration. Mr
Barbosa said the US has yet to reveal who will head the negotiating team
representing President Bill Clinton.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Discoveries triple Ecuadorean
reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING several oil discoveries in Ecuador's Amazon region, and new
studies by the French Petroleum Institute, the country's proven reserves
have almost tripled from 1.46bn barrels to 4.3bn. At the present rate of
production the country's reserves will last well into the next century.
The most recent discovery was in the Tiputini field in the easternmost
region of Ecuador. The exploratory well Pishtingo 1 alone indicated about
237m barrels, almost equal to the estimated reserves for the Tiputini and
nearby Tanacocha field together.
Mr Ricardo Estrada, the executive director of Petroecuador, the state-owned
oil company, said it was now obvious that 'the prospects of further
incrementing the petroleum reserves of the country are excellent'.
In order to tap other potential reserves in the area, Petroecuador will hold
another round of bidding for exploration in the near future.
Before exploiting the new reserves, five more exploratory wells are planned
for the area. Furthermore, 190 km of road and 300 km of pipeline need to be
constructed north-west to Lago Agrio, from where the trans-Ecudadorian
pipeline will transport the oil across the Andes to the Pacific ports.
Petroecuador calculates that the project requires an investment of USDollars
280m over six years. The field's production time is estimated 'DISTEyears,
with a maximum daily output of 45,000 barrels a day.
In order to transport the heavy crude from Tiputini, it needs to be mixed
with a lighter crude from the Panacocha field. Until a more efficient and
economic form of transport is available Petroecuador is expected to push the
development of the field while the lighter crude is still available to mix
with its oil.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador in a bind over EC
banana quotas - Raymond Colitt reports on the looming crisis for growers and
the national economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRISIS provoked by the European Community's import restrictions on Latin
American bananas is hitting home in Ecuador - making banana growers angry
but largely helpless.
In Ecuador an estimated 100,000 jobs are at stake with expected losses of up
to USDollars 70m.
Demonstrators dumped truck loads of bananas in front of the French embassy
in Quito and burned the French flag in protest.
About 2,000 banana producers, later rallying before the British and German
embassies, where they met consulate personnel, also called on their
government to develop an aggressive strategy of response and reprisal.
Yet there is little the Ecuadorian government can do against the EC's
decision, besides scouring international trade agreements for articles that
might be used in support of official complaints. Even so, the minister of
industry and commerce, Mr Mauricio Pinto, complained that Ecuador could do
little against an economically powerful EC, whose decision was largely
unilateral.
'At negotiations we were also left behind closed doors, looking through the
keyhole to see what they (the EC) would decide next,' he said.
In December the EC's agricultural ministers imposed a 2m tonne annual (down
from 2.5m) quota on the importation of Latin American bananas, as well as a
20 per cent tariff. Sales exceeding the 2m tonne quota are subject to a 170
per cent tariff, equivalent to USDollars 1,050 per tonne. The National
Assembly of Banana Growers and Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the minister of
agriculture, accused the EC of preaching free trade while imposing
restrictive measures. 'How are we supposed to pay foreign debt, reduce
unemployment and fight drug trafficking, which is increasingly invading
Europe,' they asked.
Mr Ignacio Perez, under secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, warned
that what is happening today with the banana was a sign of what might happen
in future with other commodities if Ecuador continued to be pushed aside by
the great economic blocs.
Nevertheless, Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, is not likely to
institute any reprisal measures - these would affect other sectors of its
economy more than they would hit the European Community.
A joint Latin American response is expected when the president of the
region's banana producing countries meet in Guayaquil, an Ecuador port, on
February 10.
'More realistic than fighting the EC's decision,' says Mr Gonzalez, 'is for
Ecuadorians to look for markets elsewhere and become more competitive.'
Of the 2.5m tonnes of banana Ecuador exported in 1992, more than 40 per cent
went to the EC. In the short term Ecuador has managed to sell 32,000 tonnes
to Iran, but compared with its present 315,000 tonnes of surplus production,
the country still faces a potential loss of USDollars 70m. The US, Ecuador's
largest export market, is unlikely to absorb this surplus.
The economy's dependence on bananas is significant. Of the 250,000 jobs that
depend directly on the exportation of bananas 100,000 are in danger from the
looming crisis. Another 1m Ecuadorians depend indirectly on the USDollars
600m industry, second only to petroleum as a source of hard currency.
'We've passed from a boom to a crisis in one day. While we had a bonanza
until last year, this year is likely to see prices drop, the demand for
higher quality increase, and the smaller banana producer marginalised,' an
industry analyst said.

The GOLD price held on to early gains inspired by fears over the Middle East
situation, although dealers said the prospect of further central bank sales
meant that the underlying tone was bearish. The London bullion market price
closed at Dollars 329.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 1.10 on the day. BASE
METAL trading was routine on the London Metal Exchange, with all the markets
suffering from a lack of news, and prices were mostly higher at the close.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA and COFFEE prices rallied
following Monday's falls. Cocoa futures were boosted by constructive
sentiment on charts and news that Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house, had
raised its estimate of the world supply deficit for 1992-93. The May
contract ended the day at Pounds 736 a tonne, up Pounds 18. Coffee prices
were marked higher following an overnight rally in New York and the March
position closed at Dollars 967 a tonne, up Dollars 10. Some traders
believed, however, that the overall decline might not yet be over.

THE MINNEAPOLIS Grain Exchange, best known for spring wheat futures, is
planning to cast its net wider by introducing a shrimp contract, reports
Reuter from Minneapolis.
'It's highly unusual. . . but there are some very good reasons to trade
shrimp,' said exchange president Mr James Landau yesterday. 'Our contract is
going to be based principally on white shrimp which is grown mainly in
Ecuador.' Chinese shrimp will also be allowed.
'Research indicates that the timing is right for a shrimp futures market.
Extremely volatile prices, which used to be much more predictable, dramatic
increases in US shrimp consumption and momentous changes in production have
meant high risk for importers, end users and producers,' he said. The
exchange will also seek approval for a shrimp options contract.
Mr Landau said the MGE's board of directors approved the proposal and had
submitted it to its members. Member approval is expected by January 29 and
the exchange will then submit the plan to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the US commodities watchdog, the following week. Assuming CFTC
approval, the contract could begin trading by the end of the summer, Mr
Landau said.
Ecuador produces about 73 per cent of the farm-raised shrimp in the western
hemisphere.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plan for India's biggest copper
smelter
</HEADLINE>

STERLITE INDUSTRIES, an Indian copper rod producer, is to develop the
country's largest copper smelter project at a cost of Rs7bn (Pounds 16m).
The plant, on a 550-acre site at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, is scheduled to
start commercial production at its 60,000 tonnes-a-year design capacity by
July 1995.
Annual capacity could rise to 100,000 tonnes for an additional Rs1.5bn
investment.
MIM Holdings of Australia will supply copper smelting and refining
technologies to Sterlite, and arrange the import of necessary equipment. The
main plant and machinery will, however, be manufactured in India to
specifications provided by Davy Power Gas.
The Australian company has supplied similar smelter technology to 15
operations around the world and says they are performing well.
By the time the Sterlite smelter, the first in the private sector, goes on
stream, Indian demand for copper will have increased to 200,000 tonnes from
150,000 tonnes.
The government-owned monopoly Hindustan Copper produces only about 45,000
tonnes. India's annual copper imports amount to more than 100,000 tonnes.
The country has more than 8m tonnes of copper reserves. But the copper
content in ore of most deposits is less than 1 per cent - with small traces
of precious metals - making the mining of ore for producing copper
economically unviable. To maintain the viability of Hindustan Copper, the
federal government imposed a duty of nearly 90 per cent on imported copper.
Sterlite's policy of producing copper from imported concentrate has a better
chance of proving profitable.

MALAYSIA, the world's fourth biggest cocoa producer after the Ivory coast,
Brazil and Ghana, plans a sales drive in China in an effort to diversify
export markets and improve prices.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the Malaysian primary industries minister, will lead a
trade team to China in April. Last year China imported more than 40,000
tonnes of Malaysian cocoa, compared with 6,000 tonnes in 1989. According to
Malaysian statistics, 70 per cent of China's cocoa imports come from
Malaysia. The Malaysian Cocoa Board says the country produced 184,000 tonnes
of cocoa last year, down from 230,000 tonnes in 1991. Cocoa prices stand at
about MDollars 2,100 (USDollars 840) a tonne, up from MDollars 1,800 last
August but down from MDollars 2,900 a year ago.

THE NAMEW Lake nickel mine in Manitoba, Canada, which started production in
1988, is to close permanently at the end of this year because it has run out

A PROBLEM which has long bothered the potato crisp industry will be
eliminated if field trials on a genetically-modified potato this year by
Maribo Seeds are successful.
Mr Leif Kjaergaard, managing director of the company, which is a subsidiary
of the Danisco sugar and distilling group, said that discolouring arises if
carbohydrates in the potato break down into sugar when the crisps are dipped
in frying oil.
Maribo Seeds has modified the carbohydrate make-up in a strain of potatoes,
reducing the sugar content.
The potato has been developed in co-operation with the European Chips and
Snacks Association and the European Community.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: CBOE develops volatility
index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board Options Exchange has developed a standardised way to
measure volatility in the US stock market.
Next week, the exchange will begin disseminating real-time calculations of
its CBOE Market Volatility Index, and within the year hopes to offer options
on the index itself.
Volatility has a big impact on stock portfolio valuation and is an integral
factor in options pricing.
While institutional traders have their own models for deriving volatility,
the CBOE hopes to standardise volatility assumptions for the broader public
with its index.
The index is derived from price quotes of eight near-the-market S&amp;P 100
index options, the CBOE's liquid and actively traded stock index options
contract.
The new index measures implied volatility 30 days into the future.
'The costs of many static and dynamic hedging, arbitrage and asset
allocation strategies depend on market volatility,' said Mr Alger Chapman,
CBOE chairman.
'With the impressive growth in the use of and development of derivative
instruments, it is more important than ever to be able to access during the
trading day a measure of market volatility, and integrate that measure into
current trading strategies.'
Mr Robert Whaley, finance professor at Duke University, and designer of the
volatility index model, said the volatility index concept may eventually be
applied to other kinds of markets, including foreign currency options
trading.
The proposed options on the new volatility index will give traders and
investors a means to hedge directly the risk of volatility changes while
using regular options to hedge price risk in their stock portfolios. The
ability to hedge both price and volatility is currently out of reach of all
but the largest and most sophisticated investors.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices recover as Bonn closes
withholding tax legal loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bond prices fell on confusion over who would be affected
by the government's plans to extend its withholding tax on interest income.
However, bund prices recovered once it became clear Bonn was closing a legal
loophole by extending its 30 per cent withholding tax on investment income
to include earnings received in Germany from foreign funds. The move was
seen as part of the 'solidarity pact' to finance the reconstruction of
eastern Germany.
The Liffe March futures contact fell to a low of 93.02 when the tax news hit
the screens, but recovered to stand virtually unchanged on the day at 93.20
in volume of 55,445 lots.
News that Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with privatising industry in
eastern Germany, was to launch a new bond on January 26 had little impact on
the market. There was speculation the new issue would be in the 10-year area
and could raise up to DM10bn.
UK government bond prices bounced back from their lows after the Bank of
England revealed its forthcoming gilt auction would be smaller than had
initially been expected. The gilt market closed higher on the day as a
result, with the Liffe gilt future contract rising from its opening of 99.17
to trade at 99.25 by late afternoon.
The Bank said it would auction Pounds 2.5bn of the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due
2007 on January 27. The auction stock will be partly paid, with 30 per cent
due on February 22 and the final 30 per cent payable on April 15.
The government has forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds
37bn for 1992-93, but estimates of the amount of funding that remains to be
done this year vary according to calculations concerning the Bank's
intervention to support sterling.
Mr Ifty Islam, economist with BZW, estimates only Pounds 500m of funding
remains to be done in 1992-93 taking the forthcoming auction into account
and using an intervention figure of Pounds 12bn.
DUTCH government bonds closed unchanged after a 10 basis-point cut in the
special advances rate to 8.40 per cent, made possible by the guilder's
strength and the country's inflation rate. The Ministry of Finance closed
the tap on its new 7 per cent state bond due 2003, having raised a total of
Fl 10bn, in line with market expectations.
SPANISH government bonds recovered from a bout of profit-taking to end
little changed as interest rate cuts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark
and Portugal fanned hopes of a similar reduction at home. The yield on the
10.3 per cent bond of 2002 fell from a high of 12.12 per cent to trade
almost unchanged at 12.08 per cent in late afternoon.
PORTUGUESE bonds closed higher after the Bank of Portugal cut its
intervention rate for the third consecutive week, by 25 basis points to 13
per cent. The benchmark 1997 13.0 per cent bond rose Es40 to Es10,200.
US TREASURY prices posted solid gains at the long end of the maturity
spectrum yesterday, with sentiment buoyed by reports that President-elect
Bill Clinton is considering only a modest fiscal stimulus package to aid the
economy.
In late trading,the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/8 at 103 7/8
, yielding 7.298 per cent. The short end of the market, however, was in a
sluggish mood, with the two-year note down  3/32 at 100 15/32 , to yield
4.353 per cent.
The market received an early boost from newspaper reports that the incoming
Clinton administration is planning to inject Dollars 20bn into the economy
via a programme of fiscal stimulus and that the package would be linked to
deficit-reduction measures later in the new president's term.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Two five-year dollar offerings find
favour with investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER deluge of paper hit the Eurobond market yesterday, despite the
fact that some areas of the market are overloaded due to the heavy supply so
far this year.
The dollar market remains in good shape, having largely avoided the
oversupply and aggressive pricing apparent in some other sectors. In
addition, the depth of demand for dollar bonds, with European investors
increasingly positive on the currency, has meant that paper has been quickly
absorbed.
Two five-year offerings - a Dollars 300m deal for General Electric Capital
Corporation arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation and a Dollars 250m issue for
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone via Merrill Lynch - were quickly snapped up by
investors. Both deals carried coupons of 6 per cent and were considered
fairly priced to yield 25 basis points and 24 basis points respectively over
the comparable US Treasury.
Two more borrowers tapped the Eurosterling market yesterday, despite signs
that investor interest is becoming more selective. According to dealers, as
much as half of last week's supply, totalling close to Pounds 700m, is yet
to be placed.
However, SmithKline Beecham's Pounds 100m five-year issue managed to catch
investors' attention, even though the pricing was considered on the tight
side, with a spread of 75 basis points over the five-year gilt. In common
with most of last week's five-year paper, the issue matures towards the end
of 1998. Due to the steepness of the yield curve, the spread appears more
generous when compared with the five-year benchmark gilt, which matures in
March 1998.
However, the deal benefited from being SmithKline's first Eurosterling
offering, since the name is well-liked by both UK and continental European
investors.
The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate dollars, and will
be used to refinance US commercial paper. The financing met SmithKline's
target for five-year funding of 7 1/2 basis points above the London
interbank offered rate, according to a company official.
A Pounds 100m issue of 10-year bonds for Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest
company, was considered more difficult to place, due to credit concerns
exacerbated by the long maturity. However, although Norsk Hydro's debt
rating has fallen to A3 by Moody's and A- by Standard and Poor's, the US
ratings agencies, the fact the company is 51 per cent owned by the Norwegian
government reassured some investors.
Dealers said the steep yield curve has encouraged yield-hungry investors to
buy longer-dated bonds, but added they were generally focusing on slightly
stronger credits. The deal was priced to yield 115 basis points over the 10
per cent gilt due 2003 and swapped into floating-rate sterling.
Elsewhere, the Asian Development Bank's expected Y50bn issue via IBJ
International met strong demand, particularly in Asia. The deal, priced to
yield 50 basis points over the comparable JGB, was the first 10-year
offering since last March, which had created pent-up demand for a new
10-year benchmark.
In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Turkey returned to the market for the
first time since last July, with a DM400m, seven-year, 9 1/2 per cent issue
through DG Bank.
Bankers said the spread looked fair at around 255 basis points over German
government bonds and the bonds sold well. Given the widespread expectation
that Germany will cut its interest rates, the high yield proved attractive
to retail investors.
The buyers targeted included the large Turkish community in Germany and
banks which will swap the bonds for floating rate assets (a process known as
asset-swapping).
The Council of Europe's DM200m 10-year deal showed reverse floating-rate
notes for quality names can still find demand, in spite of the large volume
of recent issues, said bankers. The initial coupon looked attractive at 8
1/4 per cent for the first two years, although the terms for the final eight
years of 13 per cent minus six-month Libor look less so.
Bankers were surprised at the appearance of Rhone-Poulenc's re-opening of a
FFr1bn issue launched last November and disappointed with its terms. They
had expected it to be postponed after the French government announced on
Monday it would continue the group's 'on-off' privatisation by selling 6m of
its shares.
Lead-manager BNP agreed the terms were more aggressive than those set on the
existing issue, but that the issue was targeted specifically at French
retail demand. The bonds, launched at a spread of 68 basis over comparable
French government bonds, ended the day trading at a spread of around 72
basis points, said BNP.
By contrast, the FFr2bn five-year issue for KfW International Finance was
well received, despite its aggressive terms. The issue, arranged by Credit
Commercial de France, broke syndicate quickly and traded at its launch
spread of 22 basis points over government bonds.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Sanyo to reduce workforce by
one-third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANYO Securities, one of Japan's troubled second-tier brokers, yesterday
said its workforce would be cut by about one-third this year, and may be
further reduced if the stock market does not recover.
The confirmation by Sanyo of a continued restructuring highlights the
extreme pressure on the 10 second-tier brokers, which have all reported
losses for the first half to September and are generally expected to report
larger losses for the full year.
The Nikkei stock average in Tokyo lost 26.4 per cent of its value last year,
while the daily average volume on the first section was 264.9m shares, the
lowest since the 239m shares of 1977 and a quarter that of 1988.
Prices and turnover have remain weak on the Tokyo market in recent weeks,
and Sanyo is aiming to reduce its workforce, which was 4,270 last April, to
3,000 by March 1994.
Another 150 administrative staff will be transferred to the sales division
in coming months.
'We are asking for the continuing support of our three main banks, Bank of
Tokyo, Daiwa Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank,' a Sanyo spokesman said.
'We don't want to sack people. The reductions will be done through
attrition,' he added.
Sanyo lost Y29.6bn (Dollars 235.5m) last year, and Japanese financial
industry analysts estimate that the broker will lose about Y40bn this year,
prompting expectations of more severe cuts in the workforce and in its
branch network later this year.
The broker has come in for particular attention because it christened the
world's largest securities trading room during the so-called 'bubble' years
of the late 1980s, and saw itself as challenging the big four brokers,
Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, for market share.

GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA) saw profits fall by 11 per cent in the
six months to December.
The results were in line with expectations and represented a creditable
performance under very difficult circumstances, the company said. It
expected earnings to remain under pressure, with little prospect of any
short-term improvement in depressed commodity prices.
Income from investments fell by 6.5 per cent to R115m (Dollars 37.4m) from
R123m, while income from fees, interest and other sources dropped to R104m
from R108m.
Pre-tax profit was 12 per cent lower at R136m and attributable profit fell
to R118m from R133m. The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share on
earnings which fell to 123 cents from 138 cents in 1991.
The majority of GFSA's assets are in commodities - principally gold, lead,
copper and zinc, as well as the developing platinum mine, Northam, which
opens tomorrow.

JAPAN Airlines, which last week announced a radical restructuring programme
aimed at reversing pre-tax losses, forecast at Y50bn (Dollars 398m) for the
year ending March, yesterday announced that it would not be paying a
dividend.
The airline said it expected to make a parent company net loss of about
Y40bn for 1992-93. In November, JAL warned that parent company net losses
for this year would total Y29bn.
JAL, which plans to cut investment by Y100bn and other costs by Y100bn in
the coming year, said the rise in the net loss for the year was partly due
to the cancellation of plans to sell securities and property due to weak
asset prices.
The airline made a pre-tax loss of Y6.4bn last year.
It plans to cut back investment in new aircraft and hiring of ground staff.
Under the restructuring plan announced last week, investment between 1993
and 1997 will be cut back from Y1,600bn to Y1,000bn.
JAL and All Nippon Airways have applied for new routes to Italy and China,
Reuter reports. JAL is seeking to operate two return flights a week on its
own from Tokyo to Rome via Milan.
It currently operates the Tokyo-Milan-Rome route jointly with Alitalia of
Italy. All Nippon has applied to operate three weekly return flights between
Tokyo and Shanghai.
CHRYSLER, the the US car maker, expects fourth-quarter earnings to exceed
Dollars 300m, according to a company share offer prospectus, AP-DJ reports.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac continues search for new
chief executive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, closed 6 cents lower at
ADollars 2.79 yesterday after the board failed to meet its self-imposed
deadline for the appointment of a chief executive.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting that the board was still
considering a small group of candidates to replace Mr Frank Conroy, who
resigned in December after a boardroom row.
Mr Uhrig said 30 candidates had been contacted after an international search
by a firm of executive headhunters.
The shortlist is believed to be headed by Mr Lindsay Pyne, former chief
executive of the Bank of New Zealand.
The announcement disappointed the financial markets, and exacerbated
criticism from more than 5,000 shareholders at the biggest annual meeting
ever held in Australia.
Several shareholders claimed the board was unable to correct Westpac's
bad-debt problems, which caused the bank to post a record ADollars 1.5bn
(USDollars 1.1bn) net loss for the year to the end of September.
Five directors, including the then-chairman, resigned in October following
the failure of shareholders to support a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue, which
closed 72 per cent undersubscribed.
However, there was no intervention at the meeting by Mr Kerry Packer, the
entrepreneur and investor who resigned from the board last week after
failing to force through a radical cost-cutting programme.
Mr Packer, proprietor of the privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings
publishing group, owns shares and options equivalent to about 10 per cent of
Westpac stock.
Mr Uhrig said Mr Packer's resignation was 'unfortunate'. He added that the
board 'knows there is a need for drastic change,' but directors would not
proceed at a pace which would damage the bank.
Mr Uhrig said Westpac's net profit in the first quarter of the current
financial year was in line with the result in the comparable period of the
previous year.
However, the chairman warned shareholders that the bank's
previously-announced restructuring plan, which includes up to 8,000
redundancies, would have a 'short-term' cost.
Mr Uhrig apologised to shareholders for the board's 'prudent' decision to
cut the dividend from 24 cents to 18 cents.
However, he was subjected to a barrage of abuse from some shareholders, one
of whom told the board: 'I am here to apply the blowtorch to your bellies.'
After eight hours' debate, the meeting was adjourned until next week.
An independent director proposed from the floor was elected on a show of
hands, but is expected to be defeated in a formal poll.
Advance Bank, a small Sydney-based bank which was formerly a building
society, said interim net profits increased by 38 per cent to ADollars 28.4m
in the six months to the end of November.
The directors increased the interim dividend by 6 cents to 20 cents, fully
franked. Advance shares closed 26 cents higher at ADollars 6.36 on the
Australian Stock Exchange.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities to cut
workforce by one-third

<TEXT>
SANYO Securities, one of Japan's troubled second-tier brokers, yesterday
said its workforce would be cut by about one-third this year, and may be
further reduced if the stock market does not recover.
The confirmation by Sanyo of a continued restructuring highlights the
extreme pressure on the 10 second-tier brokers, which have all reported
losses for the first half to September and are expected to report larger
losses for the full year.
The Nikkei stock average in Tokyo lost 26.4 per cent of its value last year,
while the daily average volume on the first section was 264.9m shares, the
lowest since the 239m shares of 1977 and a quarter that of 1988.
Prices and turnover have remained weak on the Tokyo market in recent weeks,
and Sanyo is aiming to reduce its workforce, which numbered 4,270 last
April, to 3,000 by March 1994. Another 150 administrative staff will be
transferred to the sales division in coming months.
'We are asking for the continuing support of our three main banks, Bank of
Tokyo, Daiwa Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank,' Sanyo said.
Sanyo lost Y29.6bn (Dollars 235.5m) last year, and Japanese financial
industry analysts estimate that the broker will lose about Y40bn this year,
prompting expectations of more severe cuts in the workforce and in its
branch network later this year.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder buys 50% of
Taiwan group

<TEXT>
GOODMAN Fielder, the Australasian food group, is to buy a 50 per cent
interest in Goody Foods, a privately-owned Taiwanese manufacturer of frozen
Chinese pastry products.
Goodman (formerly Goodman Fielder Wattie), would not reveal the purchase
price, but the deal is believed to be worth more than ADollars 20m
(USDollars 13.5m).
Goody Foods, established in 1979 by Mr Hector Yeh, controls about 25 per
cent of the ADollars 170m Taiwanese market for flour-based prepared foods.
Goodman said it expected the market to be worth ADollars 500m a year by
2000.
Goody employs about 700 in two factories producing six product lines under
Dragon and Phoenix brands.
Its products are also sold in Japan, Korea, Europe and the US.
Mr Michael Nugent, Goodman chief executive, said Goody was 'a very good fit'
with Goodman's cereal-based businesses.
He said the investment would enhance the group's knowledge of Asian markets.
'Goody Foods' excellent distribution network also offers opportunities to
market Goodman Fielder products in Taiwan. In addition, this venture will
offer a good bridge to the Chinese market,' Mr Nugent said.
Goodman has said it planned to spend ADollars 200m on expanding its Asian
operations.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Curtain lifts on Indonesian
drama - Astra affair sheds light on local conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ownership crisis at Astra International, the company which dominates
Indonesia's motor trade, has been a uniquely public brawl in a country which
prefers to conduct its corporate dramas behind closed doors.
The resolution to the crisis, however, has been typically Indonesian, with
the government forcing the Soeryadjaya family, the company's founders, to
sell Rp1,000bn (Dollars 484m) of shares to a 19-member consortium of
corporate and institutional investors. It has also given an insight into how
Indonesian conglomerates work.
In the past two months, Astra, Indonesia's second-largest company, has
undergone a radical change in ownership.
In November, the Soeryadjayas owned 178m of the company's 242m shares. The
remainder was split between the related Suriadjaya family (6.5m), Mr
Theodore Rachmat, Astra's president-director (4m), the International Finance
Corporation (13m), the company's co-operatives (2m) and the investing public
(38.5m).
The failure of the Soeryadjayas' privately-owned Bank Summa, owing
Rp1,600bn, forced the family to sell Astra shares to raise finance. Bank
Summa's collapse resulted, say central bank officials, from excessive
lending to other companies owned by the Soeryadjayas, which have been unable
to service the loans.
After selling Astra shares in three separate tranches, brokers estimate the
Soeryadjayas now hold just 12.4m Astra shares, with a further 20m shares
held in escrow while negotiations for their sale continue with Toyota,
Astra's main joint-venture partner.
State banks, trusts and pension funds have bought 66m shares from the
Soeryadjayas, indicating the close relationship between the state and
private business in Indonesia.
However, the main interest of investors and bankers to Astra, which has
foreign loans and facilities of more than Dollars 900m, has focused on the
consortium of 16 businessmen, most from Indonesia's powerful Chinese
community, which this week bought 75m shares from the Soeryadjayas.
Three businessmen formed the heart of the consortium, buying 39m shares: Mr
Prajogo Pangestu, who runs the Barito Pacific timber group; Mr Liem Sioe
Liong, principal shareholder in the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest
conglomerate; and Mr Henry Pribadi, head of the Napan Group.
The three men's business interests, as with many of Indonesia's top
conglomerates, often intertwine.
Their decision to buy into Astra also provides a clue to a possible future
investor in the company if, as government ministers insist, state-owned Bank
Exim and Bapindo seek a buyer for their 20m shares.
Bankers draw a parallel between Astra's problems and earlier occasions when
major Indonesian businesses were on the point of collapse.
In 1990, bankers say, Mr Pangestu and Mr Liong co-ordinated the rescue of
Bank Duta, majority-owned by three charitable foundations chaired by
President Suharto, after it suffered Dollars 419m in foreign exchange
losses.
More recently, the two businessmen and Mr Pribadi have played a key role in
Indonesia's nascent petrochemicals and plastics industry.
Mr Pangestu's Barito Pacific has been diversifying away from its core timber
business, which includes more than 5m hectares of forestry concessions and
plywood exports which in 1991 exceeded Dollars 600m.
Two years ago, however, it formed a consortium with the Bimantara Citra, run
by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son, and Mr Pribadi's
Napan Group to invest in the Dollars 1.65bn Chandra Asri petrochemical plant
in West Java.
Barito, Napan and Bimantara are also joint-venture partners in PT Tri
Polyta, which manufactures polymer resin in West Java.
Tri Polyta's polymer resin is the main input for Argha Karya, a
recently-listed company which produces plastic wrapping film, the main
shareholders of which are Napan and Mr Liong's Salim group.
The Salim group and Mr Henry Liem, nephew to Mr Liong, also hold a direct
stake in the Napan group, whilst Mr Pribadi is on the board of Indocement.
Brokers expressed surprise that, given mutual business interests, the
Bimantara group was not in the consortium buying a stake in Astra.
Bimantara and the Salim group are already joint-venture partners in
Indomobil, Astra's main competitor, which assembles and distributes Volvo,
Mazda and Nissan vehicles. Bimantara also has a stake in Star Motor, which
holds the franchise for Mercedes cars.
'Don't be surprised if, when the state banks sell their shares, Bimantara
steps in,' says one foreign broker.
Brokers stress that, despite the companies' close connections, they are
competitors. Joint ventures are favoured as a means of spreading risk and
because they allow conglomerates to cross-lend through their subsidiary
banks, brokers say.
Cross-lending allows conglomerates to undertake capital intensive projects,
while keeping within central bank limits on internal lending. It was just
these limits which Bank Summa broke with such devastating consequences for
the Soeryadjaya family.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kellogg improves 11.4% to
Dollars 675m

<TEXT>
KELLOGG, the US cereal group, yesterday registered an underlying profits
improvement of 11.4 per cent, at Dollars 675.1m after tax, for 1992.
Sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 6.19bn, or by 9 per cent if the effects
of selling Fearn International, Kellogg's former food service subsidiary,
are stripped out.
Kellogg's final figures, however, were muddied by a gain on asset disposals
and accounting changes. The net gain from asset sales was Dollars 25.8m, but
this was offset by a Dollars 269.7m charge from the change in US accounting
practice for non-pension post-retirement benefits.
As a result, Kellogg posted after-tax profits of Dollars 431.2m for the
year, down from Dollars 606m in 1991, and earnings per share fell to Dollars
1.81 from Dollars 2.51.
During the fourth quarter, reported sales fell 1.7 per cent to Dollars
1.42bn, but Kellogg said this reflected the Fearn disposal.
Without this, sales would have risen about 4 per cent. Fourth-quarter
profits from operations rose from Dollars 118.2m to Dollars 132.5m.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman, described the figures as encouraging, and said
they reflected record cereal volumes. However, on Wall Street, Kellogg
shares eased by Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 61 5/8.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Earnings up 41% at US securities
house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported 1992 earnings rose
41 per cent to a record Dollars 213.2m, despite a decline in fourth-quarter
profits.
The company earned Dollars 41.2m in the final quarter of 1992, down from
Dollars 46.9m in the same period of the previous year. Although the result
was in line with analysts' forecasts, the figure appeared to disappoint
investors, who may have been looking for PaineWebber's earnings to exceed
market expectations. At the close of trading in New York, the company's
shares were down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 25, having recovered some of their
early losses.
Several factors were behind the profits shortfall in the fourth quarter.
Revenues from investment banking fell 13 per cent to Dollars 85.5m because
of a slowdown in closed-end fund and new stock issue business, while income
from principal trading slipped almost 4 per cent to Dollars 165.5m, a
reflection of less favourable conditions in the financial markets. At the
same time, employee compensation and related expenses rose Dollars 14.3m to
Dollars 347.6m.
Other areas of PaineWebber's business, however, posted strong gains in the
final quarter, including brokerage commissions, which rose 8.3 per cent to
Dollars 205.8m, and asset management revenues, which jumped 21 per cent to
Dollars 70.9m as more investors entrusted their funds with the company's
fund managers.
Earnings were up sharply across the range of business lines last year, most
notably in investment banking, where revenues jumped 30 per cent to Dollars
380.2m, and asset management, where revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars
267.1m. By the end of the year, PaineWebber was managing a total of Dollars
35.1bn of customer assets.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM performance in UK again
worse than parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM's performance in the UK was significantly worse than that of its parent
for the third year in succession, reflecting the length and depth of the
British recession.
IBM UK recorded losses in 1992 of Pounds 616m (Dollars 936.32m), equal to
16.4 per cent of revenues, while losses for the worldwide group amounted to
7.7 per cent of revenues.
Exports, traditionally a strong feature of the UK subsidiary, fell for the
first time, underlining IBM's concern that the European market has turned
down precipitously.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, said there had been no recovery in the
UK because of weak demand, especially for hardware, competitive pressures on
margins and currency fluctuations.
He said: 'We had the unusual situation where reductions in product costs
were unable to keep pace with price trends in the market. Our export market
was affected by similar factors.'
The group turned over Pounds 3.75bn, 6 per cent down on last year's Pounds
3.98bn. Home revenue fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, compared to Pounds
1.7bn, while exports of goods and services fell from Pounds 2.28bn to Pounds
2.14bn.
The operating loss was Pounds 398m. Taking restructuring charges of Pounds
218m into account, the group loss before taxes totalled Pounds 616m, almost
five times the Pounds 124m loss in the previous year.
Mr Nick Temple, chief executive, who has been masterminding a far-reaching
plan to return the company to profitability, said the company was being
transformed from a general computing company to a consultancy and
services-led business.
But he warned that 1993 would be another tough year.
'Our overall manpower has been reduced by 21 per cent since 1990. This has
been accompanied by a reduction in the number of UK sites.
'These actions have helped us to achieve a further overall expense reduction
of 10 per cent in 1992 and will help us continue to achieve substantial
reductions in 1993.'
Salaries have been frozen and a further 1,000 jobs are expected to go at IBM
UK this year. All the job losses will be made by voluntary redundancy or by
attrition, Mr Temple confirmed. IBM UK now employs 13,934 people, compared
with 14,909 at the end of 1991.

workers

<TEXT>
EASTMAN KODAK, the photographic products company which has recently unveiled
steps to improve its lacklustre earnings record, yesterday announced further
action in its core imaging business which will lead to the loss of some
2,000 jobs.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said this was part of a plan for the group's
three business groups - imaging, health and chemicals - which was designed
to deliver 'positive cash flow and a solid increase in operating income' in
1993.
The most urgent action would be in imaging, where 1992 operating earnings
would fall short of plan, and would include cancellation of some research
and development projects; a reduction in infrastructure costs; and scrutiny
of capital spending.
Equipment manufacturing operations in Germany would be consolidated and the
company would study its manufacturing sides around its headquarters.
The job cuts will be concentrated in Rochester and will be largely
compulsory. The company employs 133,000 people worldwide, of whom around
77,000 are in the US.
Mr Whitmore said the costs associated with the job cuts would be more than
made up by the end of this year, and the overall programme would lower net
costs by more than Dollars 200m in 1993.
In a letter to shareholders, he said 1992 earnings per share were expected
to show a moderate increase over 1991, with restructuring charges removed
from both years, and cash-flow would be strongly positive.
However, earnings would be helped by one-time gains from asset sales and 'on
an operating basis, our performance in 1992 was not satisfactory.'

ALCAN Aluminium, faced with continuing low ingot and fabricated products
prices, lost USDollars 56m, or 29 cents a share, in the final quarter of
1992, against a loss of Dollars 36m, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
were Dollars 1.86bn, little changed from the 1991 period.
For all of 1992, Alcan's loss was Dollars 112m, or 60 cents, against a loss
of Dollars 36m, or 25 cents, in 1991. Revenues were Dollars 7.6bn against
Dollars 7.7bn. The figures were struck after preferred share dividends.
The 1992 loss included special environmental and rationalisation charges of
Dollars 58m, up slightly from 1991.
Mr David Morton, chairman, said the results did not reflect the strength of
demand, particularly later in 1992.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: US banks' recovery trend
continues - Chase Manhattan advances 23% over year in wake of staff cuts

<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY trend among big US banks was underscored by improved
fourth-quarter and full-year 1992 results from Chase Manhattan and Chemical
Banking in New York, Banc One in Ohio and Wells Fargo in California.
Net profits at Chase Manhattan, the New York bank that has been cutting
staff and restructuring operations, were 23 per cent higher at Dollars 639m,
or Dollars 3.46 per share, for the whole of 1992.
The earnings were up despite bad debt provisions that rose to Dollars 1.22bn
for the year from Dollars 1.09bn in 1991.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 169m, or 87 cents, against Dollars
135m, or 80 cents, last time. Provisions for the quarter were Dollars 305m,
down from Dollars 315m a year earlier.
Net loan write-offs for 1992 were Dollars 1.27bn, against Dollars 1.93bn in
the previous year, while write-offs on US commercial property loans were
Dollars 453m, compared with Dollars 377m last time.
Chase said it reduced its commercial property loan exposure in the US to
Dollars 6.7bn in 1992 - from Dollars 8.6bn at the end of 1991.
The bank's earnings last year were helped by net interest revenues of
Dollars 3.6bn, up from Dollars 3.4bn in 1991.
Chase's common equity-to-assets ratio was 5.25 per cent at year-end, up from
4.36 per cent a year earlier. The return on assets was 0.64 per cent,
against 0.52 per cent in 1991.
Chemical Banking had its first full year of operations since the merger of
Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. It achieved fourth-quarter net
income of Dollars 304m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with a Dollars
420m (Dollars 2.49 a share) loss in the same quarter of 1991, or up by 48
per cent when compared to the 1991 quarter's profit before merger-related
restructuring charges.
For the whole of 1992, Chemical's net profit was a healthy Dollars 1.086bn,
or Dollars 3.90, against Dollars 154m, or 11 cents, in 1991 after
restructuring charges and 39 per cent higher with the 1991 charge stripped
out.
Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the strong earnings 'clearly validate
the merger'.
Chemical's bad debt provisions in 1992 were Dollars 1.365bn, little changed
from Dollars 1.345bn in 1991. Total loan write-offs, excluding
less-developed countries' debt, were Dollars 1.365bn, against Dollars
1.191bn in 1991.
The bank's common equity-to-assets capital ratio was 5.7 per cent at
year-end, up from 4.1 per cent in the previous year. The tier one measure
used by regulators was 7.2 per cent, up sharply from 5.1 per cent at the end
of 1991.
In Ohio, the Banc One Corporation showed it was able to turn in solid
profits even as it continued to make acquisitions. The fourth-quarter 1992
net profit was Dollars 193.1m, or 81 cents, up by 27.7 per cent from Dollars
151.2m, or 65 cents.
Bad debt provisions were Dollars 114.3m in the quarter, down from Dollars
171.9m in the same period of 1991. The provisions level was slightly higher
for the year, at Dollars 510.5m, against Dollars 502.7m. For the whole of
1992 Banc One had Dollars 781.3m, or Dollars 3.28 per share, of net profits,
a rise of 32 per cent on the 1991 net.
Banc One's 1.34 per cent return on assets in 1992 was nearly twice the
industry average and its common equity-to-assets ratio of 8.1 per cent made
it one of the best capitalised banks in the US.
Wells Fargo, the California bank that has been hit by commercial property
loan problems, had net profits of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 4.44 per share,
in 1992, against Dollars 21m, or 4 cents, in 1991.
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 58m, or 83 cents,
compared with a Dollars 231m (Dollars 4.59 a share) loss in the same period
of 1991.
The bank's bad debt provision in the last quarter was Dollars 300m, down
from Dollars 700m a year before.
At the close on Wall Street, Chemical's share price was Dollars  3/8 higher
at Dollars 41 5/8 ; Chase was Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 29 5/8 ; Banc
One was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 52 1/4 ; Wells Fargo was Dollars 13
higher at Dollars 99.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Diller to head TV shopping
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BARRY DILLER, who resigned last February as chairman of Mr Rupert
Murdoch's Fox film and television studio, was yesterday named chairman and
chief executive yesterday of QVC Network, a leading US cable television home
shopping network.
The move follows Mr Diller's recent agreement to purchase Dollars 25m of
QVC's equity in a privately negotiated transaction.
The negotiations that led to Mr Diller's appointment are believed to be
aimed at achieving joint control of QVC's board by Mr Diller and two
corporate partners which are also substantial QVC shareholders - Liberty
Media, a Wyoming-based company that has also agreed to buy voting control of
QVC's main rival, and Comcast, a cable operator.
QVC, which had Dollars 922m of revenues in its fiscal year to January 31
1992, previously said that Mr Diller had reached an agreement to form a
group with Comcast and Liberty Media.
Liberty at present has 25 per cent of QVC, while Comcast owns 14 per cent.
QVC had Dollars 36.2m of net profits on Dollars 729m of revenues in the
first nine months of its 1992 fiscal year, which ends next January 31. The
company has 4,500 employees and reaches 42m homes in the US with
round-the-clock shopping programmes.
QVC's share price, quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, rose by
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 yesterday.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: AHP declines 3% in fourth
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday posted a 3
per cent decline in fourth-quarter net income, largely reflecting an
increased effective tax rate following the adoption of new accounting
standards.
Net earnings for the three months fell to Dollars 361.6m, or Dollars 1.16 a
share, from Dollars 372.6m, or Dollars 1.18. Sales in the quarter rose 10
per cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.82bn.
Pre-tax earnings from operations rose to Dollars 500.7m from Dollars 464m.
For the full year, earnings were distorted by a large number of items,
including a charge of Dollars 220m for the write-off of acquired research in
connection with the acquisition of Genetics Institute.
Including one-time items, net income rose to Dollars 1.46bn, or Dollars 4.65
a share, in the year, from Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 4.36. Full-year sales
were up 11.1 per cent to Dollars 7.87bn from Dollars 7.08bn.
AHP said its effective tax rate, excluding the Dollars 220m acquired
research charge, had increased to about 29.5 per cent from 22 per cent. It
expects its 1993 effective tax rate to be 26-27 per cent.
During the year, pharmaceutical sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 4.59bn,
although the rate of growth slowed to 13 per cent for the quarter.
Sales in the consumer healthcare segment were 12 per cent higher for the
year, at Dollars 1.61bn, and 7 per cent higher for the quarter at Dollars
393.9m.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Canadian airlines face warning
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government has threatened to step in if the country's troubled
airlines fail to take firmer action to reduce their chronic excess capacity.
The warning from Mr Jean Corbeil, the transport minister, follows a decision
by Canadian Airlines International to reinstate some flights which it
earlier planned to cut.
Canadian's change of heart, which will reduce its cuts from 15 per cent to
6.7 per cent of capacity, was in response to a cutback of only 3 per cent by
its arch-rival Air Canada.
The struggle between Air Canada and Canadian has been exacerbated by the
entry of Nationair, a small Montreal-based charter airline, into some of the
two leading carriers' busiest routes. All three have introduced cut-throat
fares between Toronto and Montreal in recent weeks.
A ministry spokesman declined to provide details on the action being
contemplated to reverse deregulation, introduced in 1987. 'We would like the
industry to self-discipline itself,' he said. 'But if we find they're not
capable of doing so, we may jump in.'
Any move is unlikely, however, before the government receives
recommendations, probably within the next few weeks, from a panel which
conducts an annual review of the National Transportation Act.
Air Canada and Canadian have been losing an estimated CDollars 2m (Dollars
1.5m) a day in their battle for market share.

<TEXT>
REYNOLDS Metals, the diversified aluminium producer based in Richmond,
Virginia, suffered a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 152.1m, or Dollars 2.55
per share. For the full-year, the deficit was Dollars 748.8m, or Dollars
12.56 a share.
The losses reflect previously-announced after-tax charges for environmental
and restructuring costs and for changes in benefits accounting.
Without the special items, the company said it would have reported net
income of Dollars 1.29 per share for the year, including 8 cents per share
in the fourth quarter for tax benefits related to Canadian debt
restructuring.
In 1991, the company earned Dollars 23.7m, or 40 cents per share, in the
fourth quarter.
Sales for the 1992 fourth quarter were Dollars 1.35bn, compared with Dollars
1.45bn in the corresponding period of 1991.
Mr Richard G. Holder, chairman, said continuing world oversupply of aluminum
and depressed prices led him to expect another loss in the first quarter and
'gradual improvement thereafter'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-largest US steel manufacturer, issplitting its
two large plants into separate business units in order to make them more
financially accountable and to bring them closer to their customers.
The move is a significant departure for a company which has a reputation as
one of the more conservative of America's integrated steel manufacturers.
It is one of the first initiatives by the company's new chairman, Mr Curtis
Barnette, who was formerly Bethlehem Steel's senior vice-president.
Mr Barnette took over as chairman late last year on the retirement of Mr
Walter Williams.
The new units are based on the company's two flat rolled steel plants at
Burns Harbor, Indiana, and Sparrows Point, Maryland. The two plants together
produce some 7.5m tons of steel a year. Each will now be responsible for its
own marketing, operations and financial performance.
As part of the move, Bethlehem's product marketing operations, run from
group headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, will be split between the two
units.
The move will make Bethlehem's structure similar to that of low-cost
mini-mills.
The mini-mills, which make steel from scrap metal, have made substantial
inroads over the past 20 years into markets once dominated by the integrated
manufacturers.
Mr Barnette said 'major benefits of the business unit structure include
improved customer focus, responsiveness, speed of decision-making, employee
commitment and business awareness.
'It places the responsibility for the success of the business in the hands
of those at the division level.'

SMITH Corona, the US maker of portable typewriters which is 48 per cent
owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday posted second-quarter operating
income of Dollars 5.2m, compared with Dollars 10.8m a year earlier.
Net income stood at Dollars 4m, or 13 cents a share, compared with Dollars
7m, or 23 cents, the previous year, while sales fell 22 per cent to Dollars
86.7m from Dollars 111.7m.
Mr Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive, said the company was
encouraged by signs of improving US retail sales and reduced retailer
inventory levels in spite of the decline in sales during the quarter.
'While it is too early to determine if the recent improvement in retail
activity will be sustained, we are encouraged by these recent trends as well
as the enthusiasm and upbeat mood at the recent Winter Consumer Electronics
Show,' he said.
For the six months to December 31, the company suffered an operating loss of
Dollars 1.8m, compared with operating income of Dollars 17.3m the previous
year.
In the first half, it recorded a net deficit of Dollars 1.1m, or 4 cents,
including restructuring charges of Dollars 9.5m largely related to moving
its manufacturing facilities to Mexico.
A year earlier, the company had no restructuring costs and net income stood
at Dollars 11.1m, or 37 cents. Sales for the first half slid to Dollars 168m
from Dollars 198.9m.

<TEXT>
PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported 1992 earnings 41
per cent higher at a record Dollars 213.2m, despite a decline in
fourth-quarter profits.
The drop in earnings during the final quarter to Dollars 41.2m, down from
Dollars 46.9m in the same period of the previous year, disappointed
investors, who marked down PaineWebber's stock price Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 24 3/8 before the close in New York.
Revenues from investment banking fell 13 per cent to Dollars 85.5m, while
income from principal trading slipped almost 4 per cent to Dollars 165.5m,
primarily a reflection of less favourable conditions in the financial
markets.
At the same time, employee compensation and related expenses rose Dollars
14.3m to Dollars 347.6m.
Other areas of PaineWebber's business, however, posted strong gains in the
final quarter, including brokerage commissions, which rose 8.3 per cent to
Dollars 205.8m, and asset mangement revenues, which jumped 21 per cent to
Dollars 70.9m as more investors entrusted their funds with the company's
fund managers.
The modest downturn in the final quarter could not take the shine off a year
which PaineWebber's chairman, Mr Donald Marron, described as 'outstanding'.
Like the rest of Wall Street, the company reaped the benefits of buoyant
stock markets, low interest rates, heavy inflows of investor funds into
stocks, and record levels of corporate debt and equity issuance.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Enichem loss deteriorates to
L853.9bn

<TEXT>
ENICHEM, the Italian chemicals group owned by the ENI state holding company,
has revealed a rise in losses to L853.9bn (Dollars 573.1m) at parent company
level in the 10 months to end-October 1992.
No comparable figures are available for the same period in 1991 as the 1992
figures have emerged in a special prospectus produced by EniChem for the
planned merger of 10 subsidiaries into the parent company. The 1992 figure
compares with a restated loss of L732bn for the parent company for all 1991.
At group level, EniChem lost L721bn after minority interests in the first
half of last year. Full-year figures are not due until May. Earlier this
year, the company said it hoped to close 1992 with a group loss of less than
L1,000bn.
The new information suggests that may no longer be possible. The figures
reveal marked deterioration in EniChem's financial performance during 1992.
The prospectus implies weakness in demand and prices for the bulk chemicals
which comprise most of EniChem's business.
Pro forma figures for the first 10 months of 1992 show that EniChem's
turnover amounted to L5,534bn at parent company level, against L6,786bn for
the whole of 1991.
The figures exclude results for the Montefibre synthetic fibres business and
the EniChem Augusta detergents operation, both of which are listed on the
stock market. Also excluded is EniChem's synthetic rubber business, and the
fine chemicals.
EniChem has suffered badly from the downturn in demand and lower prices for
many chemicals products. The adverse market factors have combined with
political difficulties in Italy in closing plants and trimming its labour
force, leading to increasingly heavy losses.
The group has endeavoured to alleviate matters by forming joint ventures
with other producers in a number of areas. Last year, EniChem announced a
strategic alliance with BP Chemicals of the UK in the styrene and
polyethylene fields. It has predicted that the incorporation of the 10
subsidiaries into the parent company should realise savings of up to L200bn
a year.
Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private sector bank,
forecast a significant increase in profits for 1992.
Official figures will not be available for some time. However, the bank
reported a 21 per cent rise in customer deposits to L21,367bn and a
similar-sized increase in loans to L18,856bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OF Europe's leading producers of steel tubes are combining part of
their interests to rationalise production and confront the continuing
weakness in prices and demand.
Ilva, the Italian state steel group, Mannesmann of Germany and Usinor
Sacilor of France will take equal stakes in a joint venture combining their
seamless stainless steel tube operations.
The deal, still subject to approval by the companies' boards and the
European Commission, involves Dalmine Tubi Speciali, owned by Ilva,
Mannesmann Edelstahlrohr and France's Valinox.
The new venture expects annual sales of about DM400m (Dollars 251.5m). That
would give it about 30 per cent of the European market, putting it roughly
on a par with Sandvik of Sweden, the current market leader.
The deal has been prompted by a mixture of excess capacity, falling demand
and the collapse of some export markets for seamless stainless steel tubes.
It reflects the partners' satisfaction with the operation of a similar
three-way venture, Europipe, in which they have pooled their large-diameter
tube businesses.
Mannesmann has a much larger, 50:50 collaboration deal in precision tubes
and pipelines with Hoesch, part of the Krupp steel and engineering business.
This deal, which created a company with annual sales of about DM1.2bn, was
approved earlier year by the European Commission, even though the partners
shared 50 per cent of the German market.
The commission said at the time that other European steel producers, 'such
as Ilva, British Steel and Usinor-Sacilor can be expected to act as real and
effective competitors in future'.
'To reduce costs further, rationalisations on an international basis are
necessary', said Ilva.
The company, which owns almost 69 per cent of Dalmine, said each of the
three partners would cut capacity by about 30 per cent. Precisely how the
reductions would take place is still not clear. 'There are obviously going
to be closures and job losses,' Ilva said.
Seamless stainless steel tubes, produced at Dalmine's plant near Bergamo in
northern Italy, accounted for about L100bn (Dollars 67.1m) of total 1991
group sales of L765bn.
Ilva lost L498bn before minority interests in 1991.
In spite of putting aside about L411bn of extraordinary gains into a special
fund to cover restructuring costs, the group is expected to announce a
substantially bigger loss for 1992.
IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva, has given its
management a mid-1993 deadline to produce a wide-ranging restructuring plan.

FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Thyssen to increase prices in
April as sales fall 16%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THYSSEN Stahl Group, Germany's biggest steelmaker, yesterday reported a 16
per cent fall in sales to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.57bn) in the first quarter of
the year to September 30 1993.
The group also announced it would increase its steel prices by between 10
per cent and 15 per cent on April 1, depending on the products, and by an
additional 5 per cent on July 1.
The increases would return prices to their July 1992 levels, Mr Wolfgang
Kohler, a member of the board, said.
Low steel prices have been blamed for helping to push European steel groups
into recession.
Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the board, welcomed British Steel's recent
decision to increase prices, calling it 'a step in the right direction'.
Thyssen Stahl Group was formed last October following the merger of Thyssen
Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl, the special steel division, in an attempt to
cut costs and restructure production. Mr Schulz said that the merger could
save at least DM200m.
Pre-tax profits at Thyssen Stahl dropped for the fiscal year ending
September 30 1992 to DM158m from DM651m in the previous 12 months.
All of the group's divisions were in the red, except for those producing
stainless steel and rails, Mr Schulz said.
Thyssen Edelstahl recorded a DM313m loss against a DM63m deficit in the
previous year. Sales dropped by 8 per cent to DM3.1bn.
Sales of long products dropped by 6 per cent in the first quarter of the
fiscal year to September 30 1993.
Mr Karl-Heinz Rosener, director of Thyssen Edelstahl's board, said this was
due to over-capacity in Europe, which had led to a 'ruinous price war.'
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, which manufacture long steel products,
were accused by the German company of 'dumping' products in the European
Community.
Further job cuts are expected as part of the new group's restructuring
efforts.
Nearly 4,000 workers will be laid off over the current fiscal year.
Group redundancies are expected to reach 8,000 by September 30, 1994. The
group already has nearly 12,000 employees on part-time work. The
consolidated group's total labour force is 57,500.
Mr Schulz also called on the EC to devise pan-European measures to reduce
capacity and to reduce subsidies enjoyed by some European steel producers.
He added that the recent prognosis by the German Steel Association, which
predicted that crude steel production in western Germany would drop by 5 per
cent in 1993 to 35m tonnes, was 'too optmistic'.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest charge behind 41% rise at
Aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIM Group, the aircraft cabin interior maker, reported a 41 per cent jump in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.48m in the half year to October 31 thanks to a
Pounds 460,000 reduction in its interest bill.
The improvement was achieved on a lower turnover of Pounds 19.4m (Pounds
25.2m), which reflected the disposal of the unprofitable air conditioning
contracting division in May.
The Pounds 2.5m raised from the sale led to a cut in interest charges to
Pounds 222,000 (Pounds 682,000).
Earnings improved by 2p to 6.8p and the interim dividend is a same-again
1.5p. Mr Jeff Smith, chairman, said interest charges would fall again by the
year-end, but the group had decided against raising the interim dividend in
order to conserve cash for sharp increases in working capital requirements
envisaged for 1994-95.
Aim's contracts with Airbus and McDonnell Douglas had not translated into
increased turnover because of the aircraft makers' cuts announced last year.
The group was confident it would meet the May 1994 deadline for repaying its
bankers the Pounds 6m debt they rescheduled when Aim's abortive foray into
property threatened to sink the group in 1991.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM enters standstill agreement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco MIM, the international fund management group, said yesterday it had
entered into a standstill agreement with its single largest shareholder, the
Hong Kong-based investment company, Peregrine Investments.
Peregrine has recently built up a 24.7 percent stake in Invesco through its
Peregrine Asset Management subsidiary and the agreement provides broadly
that it will not increase that stake beyond 24.9 per cent over the next two
years. Announcement of the stake had prompted speculation that Peregrine
might seek to make a bid for the entire company.
Peregrine has also agreed to liase with Invesco MIM before disposing of its
shares in the company.
Meanwhile, Peregrine Investments chairman, Mr Philip Tose, has joined
Invesco MIM as a director. The agreement provides that Mr Tose or any other
Peregrine representative would leave the board if Peregrine's shareholding
falls below 15 per cent.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Backers sought as Glass Glover continues to
deliver the goods - A logistics group is returning to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS after leaving the stock market by way of a controversial
management-led buy-out, Glass Glover, Doncaster-based provider of
warehousing and distribution services to retailers like Tesco, is again
seeking the glare of a listing.
The company has changed considerably since the July 1988 buy-out. The
previous management took the company private warning that hard times were
ahead, especially in its largest business of fresh produce and growing. The
move was soured when Scottish Amicable threatened not to sell its stake,
believing the offer price was too low.
In retrospect, shareholders may count themselves lucky they got out. By the
end of 1988, the fresh produce and growing division was in trouble due to
margin pressure. Schroder Ventures, which arranged the buy-out and now owns
almost all of the company, demanded action.
Senior management was replaced and the fresh produce and growing division
sold to concentrate on developing the distribution business.
As a result, there should be no unpleasant aftertastes when the company
returns to the market, possibly at the end of next month or in March, with a
public offer and placing valuing it at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m.
The new-look Glass Glover earns more than 90 per cent of revenues from
warehousing and distribution, also known as logistics. The remainder stems
from support services like software, security services and vehicle
contracting.
Turnover has increased steadily, growing from Pounds 45.2m in 1989 to about
Pounds 85m in the year to September 30 last year.
Almost 75 per cent of sales came from distribution for three clients, Tesco,
Littlewoods and Asda. Logistics companies often rely on only a few clients
because contracts are long term and depend on close relationships.
Tesco, easily its biggest client, accounted for 44 per cent of revenues.
Glass Glover runs three of Tesco's eight composite, or multi-temperature,
warehouses and is one of Tesco's largest external distributors.
Glass Glover is returning to the stock market partly for the prestige of a
listing. But it mainly needs to pay off borrowings taken on during the
buy-out which have constrained the company ever since.
Net debt stands at about Pounds 35m compared to shareholders' funds of
Pounds 6m. Although operating profits have increased from Pounds 4m in 1989
to Pounds 5.5m last year, the company continued to lose money after interest
costs.
Mr David Medcalf, chief executive, said the listing proceeds should leave
Glass Glover free of debt.
'We're a well regarded company with an appalling balance sheet. We want to
rectify that, to remove the debt and thereby also remove a difficulty in
obtaining new business.
'Some clients have looked at our balance sheet, and also the fact we are not
a listed company, and wondered if they really want to do business with us,'
he said.
Mr Medcalf arrived in May 1989 on the recommendation of Mr Eric Walters, a
partner at Schroder Ventures and chairman of Glass Glover since 1988.
The two had worked together at Grand Metropolitan, the food and retailing
group, where Mr Medcalf was director of accounting at IDV, GrandMet's drinks
division. He said he joined Glass Glover partly because he wanted to move
into general management.
Mr John Adamson, managing director of the distribution division, joined in
1989 from NFC, while Mr Chris Ferris, finance director, joined from
Hillsdown Distribution. Mr Medcalf said two non-executive directors would
have joined the board by the time of the float.
Glass Glover's reliance on providing distribution services to food retailers
is its main strength, but its exposure to a single sector is also a
weakness.
The company has tended to specialise in high volume, temperature controlled
distribution. Its Tesco warehouse at Doncaster, for example, has temperature
controlled storehouses ranging from room temperature for ambient products to
minus 30 degrees for frozen foods. It also operates composite trailers which
can transport goods at three different temperatures.
This kind of distribution is more service intensive and sophisticated than
delivering clothing or manufactured products. It is also difficult for new
companies to enter the market because of the skills involved and the need
for consistently accurate collection and drop off. 'We're only as good as
today's deliveries,' according to Mr Medcalf.
Glass Glover hopes to use its reputation as a food logistics company to
break into other sectors. 'If we can handle perishable food, we can handle
anything,' Mr Medcalf said.
The first significant non-food contracts were won last month when Glass
Glover was appointed by Do It All, the DIY retailer, to manage its transport
and national distribution centre, to be built at Tamworth. The four and five
year contracts are worth at least Pounds 30m in terms of turnover, the
company said.
Mr Medcalf believes there is 'enormous opportunity' in new sectors for Glass
Glover, and said the company had recently been invited to tender for a
contract for a food manufacturer, rather than retailer.
Details of the flotation are yet to be finalised, although Schroder Ventures
will retain about 10 per cent of the shares, with management holding up to 5
per cent. The prospectus is likely to show profits after tax for last year
of Pounds 3.5m on a pro forma basis, which assumes the proceeds of the
flotation had cancelled out interest charges.
Transport analysts said Glass Glover's respected client list, and its
position as one of only a handful of pure distribution companies on the
market, suggested the flotation would generate interest.
However, the company's turbulent recent history and short track record may
frustrate Glass Glover's hopes of gaining a rating in line with the highly
regarded logistics sector of about 15 times earnings.

Dealings in Aminex 5p ordinary shares were temporarily suspended yesterday
at 6p in London and in Dublin at the company's request.
The Aminex board said it would not proceed with the offer if Tuskar proceeds
with its acquisition from Bula Resources of certain North Sea licence
interests - principally a 0.90628 per cent interest in the Buchan Oil Field.
Aminex is urging Tuskar shareholders to vote against the deal at the annual
meeting.
Aminex said the Buchan oil field was in decline and that abandonment
liabilities attaching to the Buchan oil field's wells, platform and subsea
pipelines when production ceased, were likely to become the responsibility
of Tuskar in relation to the interest which it planned to acquire.
Aminex believes that its growth potential far exceeds Tuskar's prospects and
consequently the offer does not include any premium element. It is an Irish
registered oil exploration and production company incorporated in 1979,

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd placing raises Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Triplex Lloyd, the industrial engineering group, has raised Dollars 35m
(Pounds 23.4m) through a private placement on the US capital market. The
move, foreshadowed in December, effectively replaces its short-term
borrowings with medium- and long-term debt.
The placement is in two tranches, both at fixed interest rates. The first is
for Dollars 25m and carries an interest rate of 7.35 per cent with maturity
after seven years. The second is for Dollars 10m at an interest rate of 8.21
per cent and a maturity of 10 years.

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, yesterday
continued its disposal programme with the sale of the Canadian fert-ilisers
business, Nitrogen Products.
The business was sold to Terra Industries of Sioux City, Iowa. Terms were
not disclosed. However, it is understood that the operations, which included
a 430,000 tonne a year anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant in Sarnia,
Ontario, and 32 farm service centres called Agromarts, were sold for more
than Pounds 25m. In 1991, they had a turnover of about Pounds 115m.
Nitrogen Products and Agromarts, which supplied Ontario and neighbouring US
states, employed about 550 staff.
In 1991, the group attempted to sell its domestic fertiliser business, with
sales of Pounds 450m a year, to Kemira of Finland. However, the deal was
blocked by the UK government.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley profit on share deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY Group, the house-builder, made a profit of about Pounds 35,000 in
just a few hours yesterday after it was revealed that the group had bought
and sold 300,000 shares in rival construction group Higgs &amp; Hill.
Berkeley in a few weeks either side of Christmas quietly acquired a 0.7 per
cent stake in Higgs &amp; Hill at prices thought to be between 37p and 38p.
The group yesterday disposed of this stake at more than 50p after details of
its purchases were disclosed by Higgs &amp; Hill directors.
Mr Tony Pidgley, Berkeley's managing director, said that it had sold the
shares, acquired as a trade investment, to avoid its intentions being
misinterpreted.
Three years ago Higgs &amp; Hill was subjected to a bitterly contested and
unsuccessful Pounds 167m takeover bid from YJ Lovell.
Mr John Theakston, Higgs &amp; Hill chief executive, said: 'We felt we had to
make an announcement yesterday to protect our shareholders from selling
their shares too cheaply to what could have been another potential bidder
working in the same sector.
'We first became aware of the purchases at the beginning of last week and
Berkeley was still buying shares as late as last Friday. This was followed
by a 5p rise in our share price to 43p on Monday. As a result we were under
pressure from the Stock Exchange to make a statement.'
Higgs &amp; Hill's shares have fallen from more than 100p a year ago and from
more than 400p three years ago. Last night the shares closed at 49p, which
Mr Theakston said compared with a book net asset value of Pounds 2 a share
at the end of December.
Berkeley has performed well during the recession. In the six months to
October 31 it raised pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 6.92m and
increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent. Higgs &amp; Hill however, saw
first half profits decline from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 673,000 and cut its
dividend from 6p to 1p.
Mr Pidgley said that the company became interested in Higgs &amp; Hill after it
sought to place some contracts with the company and realised it was
undervalued.
Berkeley's share price rose yesterday from 314p to 318p.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hearing begins over proposed Costain sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COURT hearing began yesterday in St Louis, Missouri, over the proposed
Dollars 245m (Pounds 161m) sale of Australian coal mining assets by Costain,
the British construction company, to Altus Finance, part of the French
Credit Lyonnais group.
The transaction is being opposed by Hanson, the UK-based conglomerate, whose
Peabody subsidiary had originally agreed to purchase the Costain coal-mining
assets for Dollars 200m.
Costain intends to use the sale proceeds to reduce borrowings of more than
Pounds 340m, including off-balance sheet finance, which compares with
shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the end of 1991.
Peabody filed a suit against Costain in November, alleging that the seller
had given the Hanson subsidiary exclusive negotiating rights to the assets.
On December 31, Judge Stephen Limbaugh, in St Louis, granted a preliminary
injunction against Costain, prohibiting it from proceeding with the sale to
Altus. The trial for a permanent injunction commenced yesterday.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shares lose 39p as Eurocamp is cautious
about 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAUTIOUS statement from Eurocamp, the self-drive camping holiday
specialist, cut 39p off the shares which closed at 307p yesterday.
Eurocamp reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m for the year to October 31,
15 per cent higher than pro forma profits of Pounds 8.16m the previous year,
and compared with actual profits of Pounds 6.94m. Eurocamp went public in
July 1991, raising Pounds 24.8m, at a price of 225p.
Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said: 'Our early booking returns for 1993 for our
UK businesses have to date fallen below normal expectations.' Bookings
through the Dutch and German operations, which contributed 37 per cent of
bookings in 1992, were better.
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said that the UK market had been
slow but had firmed up recently. He said booking patterns were changing with
people delaying bookings. Normally about 75 per cent of the group's bookings
are made by the end of February. A statement about bookings would be made at
the annual meeting in March.
Turnover last year rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 61.3m, with the number of
bookings rising 19 per cent. Operating profits were up 11.6 per cent to
Pounds 9.6m, as lower margin parts of the business performed better,
although margins in each segment were held, Mr Atkinson said. Interest took
Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 470,000 pro forma).
Mr Atkinson said sterling's devaluation last September would not affect
costs in 1993 but would have a small impact in 1994. A large part of the
costs are covered by revenue from the Dutch and German operations.
Earnings per share were 24.2p (21.1p pro forma) and a final dividend of 6.3p
(5.5p) gives a total of 9.75p, up 14.7 per cent on the notional dividend for
the previous year.
COMMENT
It is near impossible to predict current year profits at this stage, though
by the AGM the picture should be much clearer. But yesterday's share price
fall looks a touch overdone, especially given the results. Eurocamp is a
much safer bet than the average tour operator, not dependent on last minute
bookings and better able to tailor its costs to sales. Further it is in a
growing niche of the market, and is expanding well on the Continent. Same
again profits and earnings would give a reasonable p/e of 12.7. If the news
is better in March the shares should have a run.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jobs to go as Smith &amp; Nephew shuts 5 sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, is withdrawing from its loss-making
cotton spinning and denim cloth manufacturing with the loss of 574 jobs.
The move marks the end of bulk manufacture of denim in the UK, priced out of
the market by supplies from eastern Europe and Asia.
Smith &amp; Nephew will close five sites in Lancashire and concentrate
production of specialist fabrics at the main textiles site in Brierfield,
Lancashire.
The production of basic gauze will also end.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, blamed 'relentless and increasing
competition from low-cost sources in developing countries' for the closures.
He said that voluntary redundancies and early retirement would be offered to
staff but that compulsory redundancies would be necessary.
The five sites will be sold as industrial or retail units and the cash
raised should pay for all but Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m of the costs of the
closures, said Mr Robinson.
A new medical fabrics division has been created at Brierfield which will
employ the remaining 626 staff.
The site will receive a Pounds 6m capital investment over the next two years
to bring it up to the standard required for the manufacturing of bandages,
dressing materials and other medical fabrics.
The company is in its close season ahead of final results and would not
estimate the effect of the closures on its profit and loss account.
However, analysts said the closures would halve the Pounds 40m exceptional
profit it made from the sale of its share of the Nivea skin care product
brand last month.
There would be an increase in operating profits because cotton spinning and
denim weaving was losing almost Pounds 1m a year.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A testing time for Dobson Park - Andrew
Bolger reports on a mining equipment joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGARDLESS of the outcome of Mr Michael Heseltine's review of the pit
closure programme, Britain's mining equipment industry faces a testing time
on the home front.
Dobson Park, which plans to put its hydraulic pit support and conveyor
business into a joint venture with Meco International, its main UK rival,
said both companies had been facing an inexorable decline in their domestic
market base, particularly since the announcement in October of British
Coal's plan to close 30 of its existing 50 pits.
Dobson said: 'The board hopes that the subsequent review initiated by the
president of the board of trade will result in some amelioration of the
closure programme but notwithstanding this, there seems little doubt that a
further material decline in the demand for the division's mining equipment
products will follow.'
The Association of British Mining Equipment Companies estimates that its
members export Pounds 400m from a total annual turnover of Pounds 900m. But
the association has told the pit closure review that international sales
will decline without a strong home market.
Abmec represents 50 manufacturers, with a combined workforce of 22,000. It
says that during the last four years, British Coal shrinkage has caused
54,000 redundancies among its members.
'The impact on members' finances has been severe, consequently many research
and development programmes, which would have assisted in the exploitation of
our overseas markets, have had to be cut. Many of our members will not
survive further redundancies if the pit closures proceed.'
If UK pits are reduced from 50 to 20, the association claims a further
15,000 employees would have to go. In addition it estimates that the value
of exported mining equipment would be cut by a third.
Dobson's mining equipment division and Meco have both shed about 1,000 jobs
over the last three years. Dobson employs about 1,200 people, 250 of them
overseas, while Meco has about 1,700 employees, several hundred of whom are
in the US.
The new joint venture, Longwall International, will be strong in its
international markets. Dobson and Meco supply all British Coal's hydraulic
pit supports for longwall seams. These inch forward, supporting the roof as
a cutter tears out the coal. Between them they have 80 per cent of the UK
market for conveyors, which take the coal away. A full-face support
installation, comprising between 120 and 150 units powered by hydraulic
jacks, costs between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m.
Longwall will have about 50 per cent of the US market for roof supports and
face conveyor equipment, and strong positions in South Africa and Australia.
Its main competitors are two German companies, Hemscheidt and
Westphalia-Becorit, but analysts said the UK group should benefit from the
recent devaluation of sterling.
Although there is considerable scope for rationalisation of Longwall in
areas where the two companies compete directly, Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson Park's
chairman, said there were also a lot of complementary activities.
Dobson had tended to concentrate on selling capital equipment, whereas Meco
had focused more on the aftermarket, rebuilding and refurbishing equipment.
Dobson's strong American operation would be able to use Meco's three US
workshops.
Mr Kaye will be the first chairman of Longwall and its chief executive will
be Mr Adrian Buckmaster, Meco's chairman and chief executive. In their most
recent results, Meco made trading profits of Pounds 8.6m on sales of Pounds
143.3m and Dobson Park's mining equipment division made trading profit of
Pounds 7.4m on sales of Pounds 101m.
Dobson Park is contributing net assets of Pounds 25m to the joint venture,
and Meco is putting in assets worth a net Pounds 16m. To offset the
disparity Dobson Park will receive a guaranteed income stream from
preference shares in Longwall and property rental.
Dobson Park and the current shareholders in Meco will each own 50 per cent
of Longwall's issued share capital. To balance the disparate interests of
the shareholders, both Dobson Park and the Meco management will each have 35
per cent of the voting rights of Longwall, the remaining 30 per cent being
held by Dowty Group, Westpac Banking Corporation and National Westminster
Bank.
Although the link-up clearly raises concerns about competition, Mr Kaye said
he was reasonably confident of clearance by the UK regulatory authorities.
It seems unlikely that Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who
has already tried to close most of the UK's pits, would block this attempt
to form a more significant force in the international mining equipment
market.

Profits of Daejan Holdings, the property group, declined from Pounds 8.77m
to Pounds 8.21m over the half year ended September 30.
The directors, however, anticipated that profits for the full year would not
be dissimilar to the previous year's Pounds 16.22m pre-tax.
Gross rental income improved to Pounds 7.91m (Pounds 6.94m). The improvement
largely reflected additional income arising from recent purchases.
The interim dividend is held at 12p and is being paid from earnings of
33.65p (34.96p).

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional lifts A Lee to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the manufacturer of steel and plastic
products in which Carclo Engineering lifted its stake to 29.99 per cent in
October, advanced from Pounds 861,000 to Pounds 2.98m in the year to
September 30.
The pre-tax line was helped by a Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 146,000) exceptional
credit from the sale of the Warrington site and by a reduction in interest
payable to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.48m).
Mr Peter Lee, chairman, said Carclo's stake was 'a worry' and 'not of our
choosing'. However, Mr Mike Thompson, corporate development manager at
Carclo, described the stake as 'a trade investment'.
Lee's operating profits grew to Pounds 2.56m (Pounds 2.2m), though the
contribution from continuing activities slipped to Pounds 3.53m (Pounds
3.71m).
Losses at Lee Bright Bars and Bell &amp; Harwood - sold in August to UES
Holdings for about Pounds 7.5m, thereby all but eliminating group borrowings
 -and Plutec were cut to Pounds 968,000 (Pounds 1.51m).
Group turnover was down at Pounds 101.6m (Pounds 105.6m) - a result of the
downward pressure on prices, said Mr Lee. Capital expenditure was Pounds
2.12m (Pounds 3.9m) and in the past five years totalled Pounds 23m, compared
with a depreciation charge of Pounds 12.5m.
In plastics, operating profits rose to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 835,000) on
turnover of Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.5m). Mr Lee said that the group would
like to be bigger in plastics, though it was on the look-out for
acquisitions in either plastics or steel.
The emphasis would be on acquiring products, rather than markets. In steel,
operating profits declined to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.87m) on reduced
turnover of Pounds 61.5m (Pounds 64.9m).
Mr Graham Holland, finance director, said that if one stripped out all
management charges, only Stainless Steel Stockholders made a loss.
Mr Lee said there were now 'some signs of recovery in the UK and US
economies', especially in the manufacture and sale of cars, an important

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV rises and seeks Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Buckley, chairman of SelecTV, the USM-quoted independent
production company, yesterday unveiled a 61 per cent improvement in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 287,000 for the six months to end-September.
He also announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 17p per share to raise Pounds
4.2m net.
SelecTV's productions include Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy.
Proceeds of the issue will be used to subscribe for Pounds 3.6m of loan
notes in Meridian Broadcasting, in which SelecTV has a 15 per cent
shareholding, and to assist in financing programme production.
Meridian was awarded the ITV franchise for the south and south-east England
in October 1991 and began transmission earlier this month. The advance in
SelecTV's pre-tax profits, from Pounds 178,000 last time, was achieved on
the back of a 17 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 6.38m. Administrative
costs rose to Pounds 870,000 (Pounds 703,000) while other operating income
declined to Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 210,000). Earnings per share emerged at
0.19p compared with 0.15p.
The cash call, involving the issue of 26.99m ordinary shares, is being
underwritten by Sheppards, which is also acting as broker to the issue. Mr
Buckley and Mr Allan McKeown, managing director, who together own 14.8 per
cent of SelecTV, do not intend to take up their rights. They and two other
executive directors are to be offered options on 12m shares at 17p per
share.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Henderson to cut TR staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration, the fund management company, has said it would
make redundant nearly half the staff of Touche Remnant, the investment trust
manager it recently acquired for Pounds 42.4m, writes Norma Cohen.
Of 165 Touche Remnant employees, 76 will lose their jobs.
As a result of the redundancies, Henderson will incur a Pounds 1.4m charge
to cover the cost of compensation, including pension commitments which will
be taken in the accounting period ending March 31. The company is
considering capitalising the charge instead of reflecting its impact in the
profit and loss statement.
Meanwhile, Henderson said the cost savings would be considerably in excess
of the charge, but would flow through in subsequent years.
The redundancies include back office staff, sales and marketing. No senior
fund managers will be affected.

FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were 'high bidders'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr CLIVE LEACH, group chief executive of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television,
admitted yesterday that the group had been 'high bidders' for its ITV
franchise.
'I put my hands up,' he said. 'We have got to do something about it,' he
said after the group announced pre-tax profits up 23 per cent to Pounds
16.12m (Pounds 13.09m) for the year to September.
But interest yesterday was less in the 1991-92 results, than in what happens
now that the merged company must pay Pounds 52.76m a year to the Treasury.
This is the sum it bid to secure the new franchise plus 5.5 per cent of net
advertising revenue - a low percentage for a company of its size.
The Exchequer levy was low in its final year. A total of Pounds 6.37m was
paid to the government by Yorkshire, including a proportion of Tyne-Tees'
dues.
'It's going to be tough,' conceded Mr Leach. But 'like Mark Twain, rumours
of our death have been much exaggerated.'
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would be in profit from year one, albeit it at a lower
level.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, believes the company will
make Pounds 10.5m pre-tax this year, but that the figure will drop again to
Pounds 7m in 1993-94 when Yorkshire will have its first 12-month financial
year under the new franchise regime.
Yorkshire has been putting considerable emphasis on cost-cutting -
reductions are already running at Pounds 11m in a full year - and on savings
resulting from the merger, such as shared transmission and advertising sales
effort.
Permanent staff would have come down from 1,257 in 1992 to 935 in March this
year. 'As we progress throughout the year there will be opportunities to
improve our working practices which means looking at the numbers we employ,'
Mr Leach said.
Although Pounds 1.1m was paid as a staff bonus in September there would be a
general salary freeze this year.
Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake of
just under 20 per cent, is forecasting that it will increase its share of
ITV revenue from about 11.8 per cent to 12.2 per cent.
Net cash balances increased from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 23.1m. 'We are very
comfortable,' Mr Leach insisted.
Earnings per share increased to 27.1p (22.9p). The final dividend was held
at 8.7p, making a same-again total of 12p.
The share price gained 8p to close at 144p.

FT  20 JAN 93 / BA shareholders concerned at combined top jobs: Doubts on
Sir Colin Marshall holding roles of chairman and chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE shareholders in British Airways have told the company they have strong
doubts about the wisdom of appointing Sir Colin Marshall to the posts of
both chairman and chief executive when the present chairman, Lord King,
retires in July.
Lord King, who is a non-executive chairman, has said that Sir Colin, now
deputy chairman and chief executive, will replace him when he retires.
However, it has not been made clear that he will hold both posts.
The shareholders said they were particularly disturbed at press reports over
the weekend that discussed whether senior management had known of the 'dirty
tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic which led to BA paying its
competitor Pounds 610,000 and making a public apology.
The shareholders said they expressed their views in very frank terms to Mr
Derek Stevens, BA finance director and board member, who phoned them earlier
this week to hear their views about the affair. 'I had the distinct
impression it was not what he wanted to hear,' one shareholder said. Mr
Stevens made no commitments during the conversation, they said.
Several shareholders said they are drafting letters to the board expressing
concern about appointing Sir Colin to the dual posts and about the adverse
commercial impact which further revelations could have.
'This is the sort of thing which points up the need for checks and balances
on the board,' said one.
One shareholder said the allegations of dirty tricks against Virgin had been
broached at a meeting with Sir Colin and Mr Stevens last July. At the time,
Sir Colin gave assurances that the matter had been investigated and that
there was nothing in the allegations.
The shareholder said Sir Colin had also responded to concerns about the
combination of the chairman and chief executive roles by offering assurances
about the independence of the non-executive directors.
Shareholders said they told Mr Stevens they expected the board to order a
thorough and independent review of the 'dirty tricks' events.
'I told them that not only must they act but that they must be seen to be
acting,' one shareholder said.
While shareholders are not demanding any resignations, they are seeking a
full investigation into the matter. 'My big worry is that there are
allegations that have not yet come out,' said one shareholder.
Institutions fear that Virgin Atlantic's chairman, Mr Richard Branson, may
exploit information not yet public to demand commercial concessions from BA.
However, shareholders said that while they were concerned about whether the
matter raised questions about the ability of BA management, they said that
so far, they have been pleased with the board's performance.

FT  20 JAN 93 / BAe and Taiwan in regional jet deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) yesterday agreed
after months of intense negotiations to establish a joint venture for the
production of regional jet aircraft.
BAe hopes the move will stem losses by transferring some final assembly work
to Taiwan, where labour costs are lower. The regional jet division incurred
an operating loss of Pounds 167m in the first half of 1992.
TAC will pay Pounds 120m to BAe in three three-monthly instalments for its
half share in a new company, Avro International Aerospace.
Another Dollars 25m will be paid when the first of BAe's RJ range of
regional jets is built in Taiwan, during 1994.
BAe will use the cash to reduce group borrowings. Net debt at June 1992 was
Pounds 987m.
'This allows us to stay in civil aviation,' said Mr John Cahill, chairman of
British Aerospace. He said no further jobs would be cut in regional jet
manufacturing.
A Pounds 750m provision for the second half of 1992 should be 'sufficient to
cover the costs of reorganisation', said BAe.
Completion of the deal is still subject to regulatory approval.
Initially, one-third of final assembly of RJs will take place in Taichung,
Taiwan, but this proportion would increase with rising sales of BAe's RJ
range of aircraft, said BAe. The sales effort will be concentrated in the
fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, although Taiwanese-made aircraft could be
sold anywhere in the world, said Mr Cahill.
Avro's six-man board will have equal representation from both companies. Its
chairman is Mr Mike Turner, currently chairman of the regional aircraft
division and its chief executive, yet to be appointed, will be Taiwanese.
TAC is 29 per cent-owned by the Taiwanese government and the rest by local
companies. It was founded in 1991 to develop the island's fledgling
aerospace industry.
It failed in November 1991 to clinch a Dollars 2bn deal to take a stake in
the commercial aircraft division of US aerospace company McDonnell-Douglas.
The RJ family of aircraft was launched in summer of 1992 as a successor to
the BAe-146.
Avro will also provide support to about 200 BAe-146s which have been
delivered to date.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Citicorp back in profit at Dollars 722m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the biggest US commercial bank, produced results for 1992 that
indicate a solid recovery when compared with hefty write-offs and a
full-year loss in 1991.
Citicorp's return to the black for the whole of 1992 was mirrored by
improved earnings at other big US banks.
The New York-based Citicorp, which has weathered 18 months of criticism from
analysts on Wall Street, produced full-year 1992 net profits of Dollars 722m
(Pounds 475m) (Dollars 1.35 per share), compared with a loss of Dollars 457m
in 1991. In the fourth quarter of 1992 Citicorp had net earnings of Dollars
280m (53 cents a share), against a Dollars 133m loss in the last quarter of
1991.
Net loan write-offs in 1992 totalled Dollars 3.6bn, compared with Dollars
4.9bn in 1991. The commercial property loan portfolio, which suffered a
Dollars 1.3bn loss in 1992, had write-offs of Dollars 1.1bn for the year, up
from Dollars 572m in 1991.
Total bad debt provisions were Dollars 4.1bn, up from Dollars 3.9bn.
Mr John Reed, chairman, said the bank had completed its two-year plan of
building capital and reserves, restoring earnings and building on core
franchises while selling non-strategic assets.
He said operating revenues rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 16.6bn while
expenses were down to Dollars 9.5bn from Dollars 10.1bn in 1991.
The global consumer business earned Dollars 941m in 1992, up from Dollars
530m in 1991. Corporate finance earned Dollars 1.1bn, sharply up on Dollars
293m in 1991.
The bank's return on assets in 1992 was still a paltry 0.32 per cent, less
than half the US industry average. Its common equity-to-assets capital
ratio, while clearly on the mend, was only 3.7 per cent, up from 3.4 per
cent in 1991.
The tier one capital ratio was much improved at 4.9 per cent against 3.7 per
cent in 1991.
Mr James McDermott, president of bank analysts Keefe Bruyette, said
Citicorp's profits were helped by wider interest margins and the impact of
expense reductions.
'The results were better than expected, although they are not out of the
woods yet and need to do more on cost-cutting and capital strengthening,' he
said.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, revised its ratings outlook for
the bank from 'negative' to 'stable'.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Protest at Airtours' planned takeover: OFT to hear that
acquisition of Owners Abroad will endanger small tour operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Independent Tour Operators is tomorrow expected to tell
the Office of Fair Trading that Airtours' proposed takeover of Owners Abroad
would seriously hamper the viability of small travel companies.
The association, which represents 126 independent tour operators, is
expected to tell the OFT that Airtours' acquisition of Air 2000, Owners
Abroad's charter carrier, would make it increasingly difficult for smaller
travel companies to book airline seats.
It will also say that the takeover would give Airtours and Thomson, the UK's
largest travel company, a dominating position which would drive smaller
travel agencies out of business. Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the UK's largest
travel agents' chain, and Airtours owns Pickfords, the second largest.
A draft submission to the OFT is to be considered by the association's
council today. Within the next month, the OFT is expected to make a
recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who
will then decide whether the Pounds 217m bid should be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Noel Josephides, AITO chairman, said Owners Abroad's seat wholesaling
business had enabled smaller operators to sell holidays from a wide range of
UK airports. He said Owners Abroad had supplied aircraft seats to every
member of the association which used charter flights. By contrast, Thomson
and Airtours used their aircraft primarily for their own programmes.
Mr Josephides added that Lunn Poly and Pickfords were able to rely on the
financial strength of their parent companies to offer discounts on holidays
which independent travel agents were unable to match. With two travel
companies dominating the industry, the position of independent agents would
deteriorate further, he said.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, told AITO yesterday that tour
operators could expect greater stability from his company's proposed tie-up
with Thomas Cook and LTU, the German tour operator. 'Our deal, retaining the
three majors, will bring a greater deal of stability to the UK market,' he
said.
Thomson was unlikely to remain passive as an enlarged Airtours would
challenge its dominance of the UK market. 'For some years forward, Thomson
should fear a combined Owners Abroad and Airtours more than it should fear
an Owners LTU deal,' Mr Klein said.

THE CRISIS facing the UK coal industry has led two of Britain's biggest
mining equipment businesses to propose creating a joint venture that will be
a leading international supplier of pit supports and conveyor belts.
Dobson Park Industries plans to combine its mining equipment division with
Meco International, the former mining equipment division of Dowty Group,
which was the subject of a management buy-out in 1989.
Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supply all of British Coal's hydraulic
roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry coal away from
the face. The joint venture, to be called Longwall International, will have
annual sales of about Pounds 200m, more than 70 per cent of which will be
overseas-oriented. Longwall will have strong market positions in the US,
South Africa and Australia.
The deal is conditional on approval by Dobson Park shareholders and the UK
competition authorities. Dobson Park, which also has power tools and toys
businesses, said this move would enable it to focus on the group's
industrial electronics division.
The two companies said considerable cost reduction benefits should result
from the integration of the two businesses, and a provision of Pounds 8.5m
has been made to cover costs and professional fees.
Both businesses in the venture have shed about 1,000 jobs each over the past
three years, as British Coal has contracted. Industry sources said it was
likely the combined group's roof support businesses would be concentrated at
Dobson's Wigan factory, while the conveyor businesses would be integrated at
Meco's Worcester plant.
Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson Park's chairman, said speculation about redundancies
and closures was premature.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Mobile telephone call costs may fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of mobile telephone calls could fall sharply later this year
following an agreement between existing network operators and a new
competitor.
Mercury PCN, owned equally by Cable &amp; Wireless and US West, intends to
launch a low-cost mobile telephone service tailored to domestic customers
and small businesses this year. It has agreed charges with British Telecom
and Mercury Communications for interconnecting their respective networks.
The agreement clears the way for the launch of the service and could force
the UK's existing mobile phone operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, to lower
their prices.
While the charging structure has not been disclosed, it will allow
subscriber prices which are substantially below the costs for
interconnection between existing networks. A peak rate call placed from a BT
network to an existing mobile telephone currently costs the customer 33.6p a
minute, about the same as the cost of a call to Athens and only a little
less than a transatlantic call.
It is thought that Mercury PCN has secured an agreement which could bring
the price of a call close to existing land-line rates of 10p a minute.
Mercury PCN said yesterday that the company believed that existing
interconnection charges were too high for domestic customers and that the
key to expanding the market was lower prices.
Without a guarantee of a large market, Mercury PCN would have found it
difficult to justify the substantial capital investment involved in
launching the new service.
Shares in Vodafone and Cellnet fell sharply on the news.
The issue of charges for the interconnection of individual operators'
networks is one of the most critical in the UK's deregulated
telecommunications market. It fundamentally affects a new competitor's
pricing structure and was a serious bone of contention between BT and
Mercury in the early days of the UK telecommunications duopoly.
Mercury PCN is likely to be the first UK company to launch a personal
communications network, an advanced person-to-person portable telephone
system based on computer technology.
A second service in which Hutchison has a stake is not expected to go live
until next year.
The effect on Cellnet and Vodafone remains unclear. Both launched low rates
packages towards the end of last year to attract new customers.

FT  20 JAN 93 / German coalition plans cuts in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S coalition govern-ment yesterday presented plans for drastic cuts
in public spending and tax increases, intended to provide a stable basis to
finance the soaring costs of German unification.
The package proposes cuts in social spending, unemployment benefits and
industrial subsidies along with the reintroduction of a 'solidarity
surcharge' on income tax and the abolition of a series of tax allowances, to
reduce the soaring public sector budget deficit.
The financial markets were concerned at one element, which would extend the
30 per cent withholding tax on investment income to include dividends from
offshore investment funds. Analysts in Frankfurt played down the
significance of the move, however, suggesting that it would not have a big
effect on the flow of money out of the country.
Because of the downturn in the German economy, with gross domestic product
officially forecast yesterday to stagnate or decline by up to 1 per cent
this year, the immediate result of the package will be a DM10bn (Pounds 4bn)
increase in the central government deficit for the year.
In the longer term, however, the proposal is intended as the basis for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's planned 'solidarity pact' between central
government, opposition, the 16 state governments, trade unions and
employers, aimed at launching a recovery of the east German economy.
It is also intended to provide 'room for a reduction in interest rates' by
the Bundesbank, by demonstrating the will to reduce the structural budget
deficit in the public sector, the Ministry of Finance said.
The 50-page document, entitled a 'federal consolidation programme', was
finalised by leaders of the coalition yesterday, and presented to their
supporters in the German parliament. The planned savings, however, ran into
criticism from trade unions and the opposition Social Democrats for
targeting social spending and unemployment benefits. They warned that the
whole solidarity pact could be endangered.
The immediate savings package would cut some DM9bn from central government
spending this year, to finance extra investment subsidies in east Germany,
support for local government, and extra payments to Russia for accelerated
troop withdrawals from its former satellite.
The additional DM10bn increase in the federal government budget deficit, set
to rise from DM43bn to DM53bn this year, is blamed on a DM5bn shortfall in
tax revenues and a DM5bn increase in unemployment payments, because of the
economic downturn.
In a bid for trade union support, the package proposes a one year extension
in the life of the Treuhand privatisation agency, from end-1993 to end-1994.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Eurocopter signs Russian deal: Joint venture group plans to
develop 30-seat civil helicopter by 1999

EUROCOPTER, a Franco-German helicopter manufacturer, yesterday announced it
had signed an agreement with three Russian companies to develop and market a
30-seat helicopter.
Eurocopter is the first western helicopter group to establish an industrial
partnership with the Russian helicopter industry.
The group signed a co-operation deal with Mil, Kazan and Klimov to develop
and market a 30-seat, 14-tonne civil helicopter. The craft, called the MI38,
will compete against western-produced models.
The helicopter, expected to enter service in 1999, will be developed at the
Mil helicopter plant in Moscow.
Mr Jean Francois Bigay, Eurocopter's chairman, said the European group would
invest about FFr550m (Pounds 67m) in the project. The Russian authorities
had agreed to finance their share, he added.
Eurocopter will be responsible for the cockpit, avionics system and
passenger accommodation of the twin-engined helicopter. It will compete in
the same market as the civil version of the EH101 helicopter under
development by Westland of the UK and Agusta of Italy.
The MI38 is also expected to challenge plans by Sikorsky of the US to
develop a large helicopter, the S92. Mr Bigay said market studies suggested
an annual demand for about 300 large helicopters worldwide.
Eurocopter is the west's second largest helicopter manufacturer after
Sikorsky. It was formed last year when Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche
Aerospace pooled their helicopter activities.
Russia has long been the largest producer of helicopters. Since the break-up
of the Soviet Union, Russian companies have been seeking partnerships with
western manufacturers to help them penetrate western markets.
Western manufacturers have also shown growing interest in co-operation with
Russian companies to break into the Russian helicopter market, which has
been closed to western companies up until now, and is regarded as offering
significant longer-term potential.
Western aerospace manufacturers in general are keen to forge links with
Russian groups. Agreements have already been signed between Russian
companies and western airframes, avionics and aero engine companies, but
until yesterday no agreement had been reached in the helicopter sector.
However, the helicopter market continues to be under pressure because of the
decline in military spending and economic slowdown. Eurocopter booked 159
new helicopter orders last year compared with 256 in 1991, reflecting the
general decrease in the industry.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Higgs and Hill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flurry of excitement surrounding housebuilder Berkeley Group and Higgs
and Hill was over almost before it started yesterday. Berkeley sold its
stake in Higgs at a tidy profit as soon as market awareness of its interest
caused a spike in the price. Nevertheless, the episode highlights anomalies
in the valuation of some construction companies.
Many housebuilders have long traded at a sizeable discount to stated assets
 -and with good reason. The market has been unable to assess the true worth
of assets as companies have collapsed and land prices have crumbled. Valuing
shares has been rather like trying to pin the tail to the donkey.
But Berkeley's purchase of Higgs' shares was prompted by the belief that the
disparity between asset value and share prices had gone too far. With Higgs'
sound enough finances and book assets of Pounds 2 per share valued at below
40p, it is difficult to disagree. The point may have been reached when it is
cheaper for growing housebuilders, such as Berkeley, to acquire land by
buying undervalued rivals than to buy land directly.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market was short-sighted to rally on the basis that the
forthcoming auction will be for Pounds 2.5bn rather than the Pounds 3bn that
some had feared. Before long the auctions will become considerably larger.
Yesterday's PSBR figures confirm the trend towards a larger deficit.
Stripping out the distortions caused by monthly VAT payments adds around
Pounds 1bn to December's deficit. Central government revenues thus fell
slightly in the first nine months of 1992-93 while expenditure increased by
almost 15 per cent. Having largely funded this year's deficit, the
authorities may want to avoid premature alarm about 1993-94. But investors
should be wary.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of looking at the share price implications for British
Airways of the Virgin libel victory. The indulgent one, adopted by the
market so far, is that it will have little fundamental impact. Disgracefully
though BA has behaved, the government is not about to force it to cede
routes to Virgin. BA is unlikely to lose nor Virgin to gain much business as
a result of the case. BA may find its relations with government a little
harder, but it does not mind brushing with authority - witness its decision
to halt contributions to the Tory party in 1991.
This version, though, may be too simple. The market has come to attribute
BA's transformation to the leadership of Lord King and Sir Colin Marshall.
Their failure to root out and stop the dirty tricks campaign against Virgin
reveals their judgment as seriously flawed. Less can be taken on trust in
future, especially if BA now becomes inward-looking and obsessed with damage
limitation.
Perhaps the strategy is not all it is cracked up to be. Having failed to
cement its original alliance with USAir, should BA now be doggedly pursuing
a lesser but still costly deal with the same partner? Mr Branson is
determined to make the most of his victory. The more he succeeds in shaking
faith in BA's leadership, the greater the threat to its share price. If
investors were to start losing money as a result, complaints about corporate
governance would escalate.

FT  20 JAN 93 / NHS managers urged to woo private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Health Service man-agers should work more closely with the private
sector, according to a government circular.
A letter from Mr Gordon Greenshields, NHS director of finance, going today
to hospital and health authority finance managers, calls for more joint
ventures with the private sector, leasing arrangements and market testing
the possibilities of contracting-out patient and support services.
The letter, which tells managers to be 'innovative and receptive' to new
ideas for increasing the use of private finance, is the department's
response to the announcement in the Autumn Statement of arrangements to ease
the use of private capital in the public sector. But it reflects the view of
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, that the government has taken the
sting from the controversy over NHS reforms, and can promote private sector
investment without reviving allegations that it wants to privatise the
service.
Mrs Bottomley said yesterday that the guidance to managers was intended to
'break a few windows' and encourage more collaborative thinking between
public and private sectors.
'The old apartheid between the public and private sectors should be buried,'
she said. 'The NHS is not for privatisation and it is not for sale. Where
there are opportunities for the NHS to involve the private sector in
cost-effective initiatives that benefit patients they should be taken.'
Mr Greenshields' letter says the greater scope for using private capital in
the NHS will mean 'additional resources for health care.' Managers will be
told to consider joint ventures in areas such as waste incineration, energy
conservation, patient hotels - facilities for people recovering after
treatment who no longer require intensive nursing - and other accommodation
that could be used by NHS and private patients.
Leasing will not count against hospitals' external financing limits or cash
allocations, provided it gives better value. Expensive medical equipment
like scanners, computers and transport are among areas the department
considers suitable for leasing.
Market testing of services with significant capital costs is being
encouraged. The NHS's laboratory services - regarded by some managers as
offering scope for considerable efficiency improvements - will be among the
candidates for market testing.
The guidance to NHS managers follows talks between Mr Tom Sackville, junior
health minister, and representatives of potential private sector partners.

FT  20 JAN 93 / When profits land you in hot water: Are customers carrying
too much of the burden of UK water privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years of drought have ended, but 1993 is likely to bring fresh troubles
for the UK water industry. The Labour party called yesterday for savage
windfall taxes on privatised utilities' profits, which prompted a 50 per
cent rise in shares in water companies last year, making water the
best-performing sector in the London stock market.
This week also saw another tussle between the water industry and its
regulator, Ofwat, over the basis for next year's Periodic Review, in which
Ofwat will reassess the way water bills are calculated for the first time
since privatisation. Ofwat has made clear its concern over rising water and
sewerage bills - in two months, they will rise by an average of 10 per cent,
a leap of nearly 60 per cent since privatisation three years ago.
These controversies could be inflamed further this year by a political
battle over plans to sell Scottish Water. All this raises questions of
whether water privatisation has been successful, and whether regulation
adequately protects customers.
Three years of private ownership for the 10 water companies of England and
Wales have brought some undisputed benefits - principally cleaner drinking
water and beaches, and faster customer service. Before the December 1989
flotation, the industry, including the 33 small water companies which are
not quoted on the stock market, had suffered years of underinvestment. In
many cases, water did not comply with EC standards passed nearly a decade
earlier.
According to Mr Trevor Newton, group managing director of Yorkshire Water,
the need for massive spending, estimated in 1989 at Pounds 28bn, was the
main motive for privatisation. 'It's the same in Scotland now - probably
Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn of spending needed which the local authorities cannot
finance.'
As a result of the spending, treatment plants have been improved, and within
several years the UK will stop piping sewage into the sea. Levels of
pesticides, nitrates and lead in drinking water have been reduced, and the
speed of response to ruptured pipes and flooded sewers is greater. Companies
also argue that they have become more efficient: 'There has been a sea
change in attitudes,' says Thames Water.
However, critics of water privatisation maintain that customers carry much
of the cost of this modernisation through higher bills - and that they are
paying too much. The pricing formula agreed in 1989 was that a company could
put up prices each year by the rate of inflation plus a 'K' factor - a
number set for each company by Ofwat, to allow it to pay for new spending.
As a result, water and sewerage bills have risen by about 5 per cent more
than inflation each year and will reach an average Pounds 170 a year on
April 1. This compares with annual rises below inflation for the privatised
telephone, gas and electricity utilities.
Ofwat has warned that last year's bills could double in real terms by 2005
as the true cost of meeting EC and national environmental rules becomes
clear. By then, the regulator has suggested, full compliance with all the
rules could mean spending of Pounds 45bn, more than 50 per cent higher than
estimates at privatisation.
Even water executives have criticised the privatisation for not anticipating
the industry's costs more accurately. Some also suggest that, because the
price formula allows the water companies to pass on much of the cost to
customers, it has encouraged over-ambitious water standards, beyond the
levels necessary for health. 'I think that (if the government had been
bearing the costs) there may well have had to be more scrutiny of the
standards and more pressure on their costs, going back to the drawing board
in some cases,' says Sir Roy Watts, chairman of Thames Water.
Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth claim that, for the same
reason, the price formula has given water companies little incentive to try
to pass costs back to industries and farms, which are the source of the
pollution. The water industry stresses the difficulty of identifying the
culprits, but concedes some of the charge: 'It is policy to make the
polluter pay, but there's not a lot of (that practice) about,' says Sir Roy
Watts.
However, the most frequently voiced attack on the privatisation, and the
focus of Labour's complaints, is that shareholders do not carry enough of
the industry's financial burden. Dividends have risen by between 6 per cent
and 10 per cent a year since 1989, and the shares - now worth Pounds 10.7bn
 -have more than doubled in value.
Financial analysts point out that critics often overstate the attractions of
the shares. They argue that, although the reliability of the water
companies' profits and dividends has increased the shares' popularity during
recession, this advantage will diminish by comparison as other companies
recover.
However, the question of striking the right financial balance between
shareholders and customers is also the main dispute - and an increasingly
acrimonious one - between the water industry and Ofwat. Ofwat is ultimately
responsible for getting that balance right when it sets price rises - a
tough job, because it is almost impossible to create even limited
competition in supplying water and sewerage.
On Monday, the disagreements broke out again when the water companies
attacked Ofwat's latest consultation paper as 'fundamentally arbitrary and
flawed'. Alone among the utility regulators, Ofwat is legally obliged to
allow the companies to earn a 'reasonable rate of return' on their capital
when setting price rises. The dispute is about how to define that reasonable
rate of return, an issue central to the 1994 Periodic Review.
That review, which will set rises in water bills until 2005, will be the
biggest test since privatisation of whether the regulatory framework
adequately protects the customer. Mr Byatt has won public praise for his
concern for poorer households faced with hefty bills. He can take some
credit for the industry's increasing efficiency - he has made clear that he
may penalise inefficient companies by setting them lower annual price rises
at the review. He has also restrained price increases - held back this
spring by about 1 per cent.
However, leading City firms are questioning whether Mr Byatt will be able to
be as tough at the review as his public comments suggest. Robert Fleming
Securities, the investment house, argued in a report last month: 'Any
attempt by Ofwat to set tough new price controls will be thwarted by the
industry's massive investment programme. The programme is the saviour for
shareholders . . . Ofwat cannot afford to be too severe or it will be in
breach of its legal requirements to ensure that the industry can finance its
activities.'
The argument is put vigorously by the industry itself: according to one
finance director, 'Mr Byatt has to face the realities of the market - we
need the rates of return we are getting to raise money for the capital
spending'.
Comments like that identify one of the biggest difficulties of Ofwat's role,
and one of the possible weaknesses of the regulatory regime in protecting
the customer. Mr Byatt appears to have formidable power in setting price
rises. But he is also legally obliged to set them high enough for companies
to have enough money to bring their pipes and plants up to specified
standards. Yet he does not control the water quality standards, which are
set by the European Commission, the UK government and the National Rivers
Authority, the river-quality watchdog. As a result he has almost no control
over the industry's costs - and so in reality only limited control over
prices.
Mr Byatt's decisions in 1994 will show whether scepticism about the extent
of his power is warranted. In the event, the water companies' anxieties
about how their customers react to rising bills may be at least as important
as Ofwat's endeavours to restrain them.
A few companies say privately that most customers do not yet seem worried
about bills, which are still usually less than those for gas, electricity or
telephone. But water will eventually overtake the others  - 'and I guess we
know in all honesty we can't keep putting up the prices forever at this
rate, whatever the K formula says', one finance director concedes.
The water companies are right to be concerned - they have a difficult case.
Privatisation has clearly brought customers cleaner water and beaches, but
there are legitimate concerns that the price they are paying may be too
high.

FT  20 JAN 93 / The myth of Britain's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there no limit to the British passion for self-denigration? Newspapers
and magazines are filled with articles lamenting - or revelling in - the
breakdown of national institutions, the demise of traditional British
virtues and the weakening of the economy. After a false dawn in the 1980s,
some commentators are delighted to report, Britain has regained its
reputation as the sick man of Europe.
This mood, spread by a coalition of frustrated anti-Thatcherites on the left
and nostalgic conservatives on the right, is dangerous. By encouraging the
belief in an all-encompassing British decline, it distracts attention from
the piecemeal attack on specific problems which are neither insuperable in
themselves nor substantially different in character and severity from those
that afflict other countries.
The media establishment (far more powerful than the old 'establishment'
which is said to rule our lives) trots out the usual culprits - class
system, public schools, anti-industrial culture and so on. Most of these
gloomy diagnoses are linked, directly or indirectly, to a sense of
disappointment, even despair, over Britain's economic performance since the
second world war.
But is this despair really justified? An understanding of Britain's postwar
record is not helped by the tendency, perhaps reflecting wartime successes,
to overstate the country's competitive strengths in the 1940s and 1950s.
There is a widespread view that Britain, mainly through the ineptitude of
businessmen, threw away opportunities for industrial leadership after the
war. But it is quite unrealistic to suppose that, in the trading environment
which prevailed from the 1950s and 1960s onwards, Britain could have
retained industrial leadership, except in one or two sectors where domestic
conditions were particularly favourable.
The liberalisation of world trade posed problems of adjustment for Britain,
as it did for the other advanced industrial nations. As a medium-sized
industrial power Britain had to find a place in an integrated world economy
in which other nations - the US and Japan in some fields, the newly
industrialising countries in others - had important competitive advantages.
Britain faced a number of particular obstacles in making this transition,
some stemming from the legacy of the industrial revolution (outdated
structures and institutions in older industries such as textiles and steel),
some from post-war events (the sellers' market of 1945-51, the orientation
to the Commonwealth, delayed entry into the Common Market). These and other
factors made it more difficult for Britain to grow as fast as its
continental neighbours in the 1950s and 1960s. It might have been better if
Britain had resigned itself to slower but steadier expansion during that
period, instead of trying to kick-start the economy and then, after the dash
for growth had fizzled out, looking for scapegoats to explain its failure.
From the early 1960s, when the habit of national self-denigration began to
take hold, the search for scapegoats - and for miracle cures borrowed from
other countries - has been a recurring theme in British economic comment.
Viewed from today's perspective, the industrial adjustment which has taken
place since 1960 can be seen as neither brilliant nor catastrophic, but a
patchy outcome not hugely different from that of, say, France. Compared with
the continental countries, Britain did less well in the earlier post-war
period, with governments and industries fumbling for a way round the
obstacles, but more respectably since the late 1970s, as companies responded
to intense international competition and took advantage of the Thatcher
government's reforms.
None of this justifies complacency over the productivity lag which persists
in many industries, or over the loss of capacity resulting from the earlier
period of floundering, followed by two severe recessions. But it is not
helpful to regard these problems, and more generally the serious economic
difficulties which the country now faces, as symptoms of some deep-seated
flaw in the system which, almost by definition, is irremediable.
Constructive self-criticism is welcome, as are practical proposals for
dealing with individual ailments. Exaggerated gloom about all things British
is unnecessary and counter-productive.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Risks ahead in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN TIMES are hard in Germany, Katastrophe tends to be an overworked word.
Yet it is now starting to seem an apt description of the plight of the
German economy. The Bonn government, habitually optimistic to the point of
insouciance on the economic outlook for united Germany, is forecasting no
growth for east and west Germany in 1993.
Many German manufacturers are uncompetitive as a result of high increases in
labour costs during the 1989-1991 unification boom and the recent rise in
the D-Mark against other European currencies. German exporters are thus
unlikely to profit more than marginally from any US-led recovery in the
world economy later this year. For the first time in the postwar era,
Germany this year is likely to register an unfavourable combination of an
above-average inflation rate, a current account deficit, zero or negative
growth and (if the 'Clinton effect' persists) undue D-Mark depreciation.
Deprived of growth in an economy making up more than a quarter of EC GDP,
Germany's neighbours face an outlook only a little less sobering. The
Brussels Commission's forecast of only 0.8 per cent expansion in EC
economies this year indicates that the Community may experience a rerun of
the 1981-82 recession.
Industrial destruction
Against this dispiriting background, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has
been labouring to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with unions and employers.
Mr Kohl wants to trade agreement on measures to curb the budget deficit with
undertakings from trade unions to hold down wage growth in east and west.
The results so far have been disappointing. In trying to reshape Germany's
economy to weather a cyclical downturn in the west and a restructuring
crisis in the east, Mr Kohl is climbing a mountain. He is still only halfway
up the slope.
His longer-term objective is to lower the costs of reunification, rising
sharply as a result of transfer eastwards of west Germany's rich-economy
system of wages, social benefits and regulations. This has hastened east
Germany's industrial destruction, and increased the dependency of its
population on subsidies.
The shorter-term objective is to convince the Bundesbank that inflation, at
an underlying 4 per cent, has reached its peak. If Mr Kohl manages to stitch
together a convincing package, the Bundesbank should be able to start a new
round of discount and Lombard rates reductions next month. The central bank
is not yet, however, persuaded that the conditions are right.
Exorbitant rises
Bundesbank caution is understandable. Wage growth in west Germany,
certainly, will slow sharply this year, with many sectors likely to settle
for increases of about 3 per cent. But this is a result not of the
'solidarity pact' but of the recession. Mr Kohl has not yet managed to
persuade unions to renegotiate exorbitant 26 per cent wage rises payable to
east German engineering workers in April. The government should announce
that, unless this step is rescinded, it will reconsider its recent decision
to inject fresh subsidies into moribund east German industrial regions.
On the fiscal front, yesterday's federal government budgetary announcements
include some welcome moves to curb tax breaks. But, while avoiding
across-the-board tax increases until 1995, the measures fall a long way
short of the vigorous attack on public sector spending and subsidies needed
to reshape the German budget. There is little sign that the government is
considering fresh privatisation measures as a means of increasing revenues.
State and municipal governments have yet to show they are prepared to join
in Bonn-ordained fiscal austerity.
Mr Kohl and his cabinet have so far proved incapable of bringing about the
reordering of German economic priorities made necessary by reunification.
For two years, the necessity has been unquestioned, including by Germany's
leaders. What has been lacking is the will and authority to take action. A
long recession would further diminish the room for fiscal and monetary
manoeuvre. The Bonn government - and the rest of Europe - must profoundly
want to avoid the economic and political dangers of a prolonged downturn.
But time is fast running out.

Fresh evidence of Richard Branson's highly individualistic business approach
emerged at yesterday's press conference on his new national pop radio
station.
As the man who humiliated mighty British Airways explained his plans to beat
the BBC at the pop radio game, a colleague's attention was caught by a
message inked on Branson's hand.
A reminder to call Lord King perhaps, or Transport Secretary John MacGregor?
Something much more important, it seems. A reminder to call Roger Bray, the
Evening Standard's air correspondent and travel writer.
And no, Branson was not returning Bray's call. The prolific communicator
just wanted to bend the hack's ear about his latest mission - capturing some
of BA's airport slots.

Good to see Professor Patrick Minford, a leading apostle of free-market
economics, practising what he preaches.
Two years ago the government's Economic and Social Research Council axed his
Pounds 100,000-a-year research funding, so Liverpool University's answer to
Lord Keynes has been searching high and low for a new source of venture
capital.
He has finally persuaded Cardiff Business School, one of the richer bits of
the University of Wales, to give him Pounds 50,000 a year for five years, in
exchange for a long-term study on the Welsh economy.
Cardiff's links with Minford - a member of the Treasury's new panel of
outside economic experts, which includes Cardiff's visiting professor, Tim
Congdon - should give it a higher profile in the notoriously clubby UK
economics community.
However, Minford has had to pay a fairly high price to remain in the
forecasting business. He has had to cut his team in half since 1991.

On the day he landed the job as a presenter of the BBC One O'Clock news,
John Tusa, former World Service boss, was in Moscow showing off his hobby
horse, the 'Marshall Plan of the Mind'.
Sadly, the new Russian information minister, for one, was not exactly bowled
over. How much would the series of radio programmes on the market economy
cost, Mikhail Fedotov enquired. On being told they were free, he wanted to
know how the British could contemplate giving away a programme on how to
make money.
Then there was a point about the 'House Seven Entrance Four', a soap opera,
part of the same endeavour, already running and featuring the
now-all-too-familiar Russian characters - a redundant academic, a

Still on the subject of the monarchy, Japan was glued to its TV sets
yesterday as the country's soon-to-be married crown prince and his
diplomatic bride - dubbed 'superprincess' - held their first press
conference.
No surprises from the prince who told the nation that he had never managed
to get 29-year-old Ms Masako Owada out of his mind. As for her parents, they
seemed rather glum at the prospect of their daughter disappearing behind the
palace walls. However, a few eyebrows were raised when Ms Owada, in a spot
of nervous humour, said she hoped the prince did not want enough children to
start an orchestra.

Britain's Labour party desperately needs an injection of new ideas, but it
is hard to believe that Jack Straw's thoughts on the monarchy, however
revolutionary, should be given top billing.
Much more interesting would be to hear Straw's ideas on how to shake up the
appalling education system in England and Wales, a task he failed to address
properly during his four-year stint as shadow education secretary.
Unless Labour can come up with some sensible ideas on how to improve
education, raise the standard of public services and tackle poverty -
without doubling taxes - it'll never have a hope of tidying up the monarchy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Australian premier Lynn Arnold arrives in London this week on a
top-secret mission. His cover story is that he is here to rail against the
Defence Ministry's stone-walling over the cost of cleaning up the 1960s
nuclear test sites in the Nullarbor desert.
That, however, is partly a screen for an even more important job he plans to
do. His contact man for it is Bernie Ecclestone, executive director of the
Formula One Constructors Association, the most powerful man in Grand Prix
motor racing. Since the mid-1980s, Arnold's home town of Adelaide has staged
the November finale to the Formula One championship, an event raising around
ADollars 100m in tourism revenues.
However, a formidable cloud has been spotted recently on Adelaide's horizon
 -a new federal law banning tobacco advertising in Australia after 1995. The
same cloud has already caused the demise of the French Grand Prix. And the
Adelaide race is dead if sponsors like Marlboro get the jitters.
Arnold's pitch to Ecclestone is likely to consist of an assurance that the
state government will apply to Canberra for an exemption from the new
legislation for the Grand Prix. Somehow that doesn't sound like a promise
that will impress an argumentative opponent like prime minister Paul
Keating. No doubt Arnold has a more powerful secret weapon in reserve.
Declare independence, perhaps?

FT  20 JAN 93 / A share of South Africa's spoils: The government and the ANC
are putting stability before democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not considered polite to say so, but the African National Congress and
the ruling National party have decided that South Africa is not ready for
democracy.
Today, officials from the two sides will meet to discuss just what political
system will suit the new South Africa as it matures towards democracy. But
they have already resolved that power should be shared between black and
white for the foreseeable future, even after eventual multiracial elections.
It is a solution which may promise political stability - but can scarcely be
described as democratic.
Over time, the new government may succeed in building democracy by
instalments. But in the near term, South Africans will have to content
themselves with rule by a coalition of convenience between the ANC and the
government (and perhaps some of their opponents) - by a multiracial
oligarchy, more or less benevolent, more or less authoritarian.
Such a solution was probably inevitable for a nation which made ethnic
division its raison d'etre for 350 years. No less an authority than the
American founding father James Madison recognised the problem of plural
societies 200 years ago. In The Federalist Papers, he wrote: 'It is of great
importance . . . not only to guard the society against the oppression of its
rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the
other part.'
Now the ANC has accepted that principle and agreed to power-sharing, not
just in a short-lived interim government, but for an indefinite period under
the first permanent multiracial constitution. The next few months will tell
whether the ANC intends to erect just a facade of power-sharing, while
retaining all important powers for itself, and whether the government still
clings, unrealistically, to an effective white veto. But the principle is
agreed that there will be a coalition cabinet - even if the ANC wins a
dominant share of the vote, not only in elections for an interim government
which could take place early next year, but also in an eventual poll held
under a new constitution.
So the two sides have decided that neither can govern alone: Pretoria lacks
the legitimacy, and the ANC lacks the skills. They belong together, in an
arrangement which Lawrence Schlemmer, a South African political scientist,
describes as government either from 'separate bedrooms', or from 'separate
beds' - marriage is on the cards.
In the short term, this arrangement will be good for each of the parties,
and for stability - but not for democracy. For with the ANC and government
snug in coalition together, South Africa would effectively be a one-party
state: the ANC/NP - with 75 per cent or more of the vote (around 50 per cent
for the ANC, 25 per cent for the Nationalists) - would drive a wedge between
opposition on the left and right, leaving only splinter groups on either
side.
The one wild card is the Inkatha Freedom Party, which has a strong regional
base among Zulus and whites in Natal province. Some polls put its support as
high as 10 or 11 per cent nationwide. The priority, according to ANC and
government officials, is to bring Inkatha into the governing coalition as a
junior partner. But both have made clear that, if necessary, they will rule
without Inkatha.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, may well reject this
subordinate status. His reaction will do most to determine the character of
the new power-sharing government. If he can be enticed to join, there would
be a chance of benevolent rule by consensus. If he stays out then Mr F W de
Klerk, leader of the National Party, and Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the
ANC, might have no option but to crack down on the violence which would
ensue. Civil liberties, rediscovered after decades of apartheid repression,
could be a casualty.
So South Africa may revert to some form of authoritarian rule, whether by
the white minority or by a multiracial majority. But both the ANC and
government seem genuinely to believe that more democracy is inevitable -
eventually.
Constitutional talks between the two sides are already focusing on just this
issue: should power-sharing be enforced or voluntary? Should regions have
autonomous powers? In short, what constitutional model is both more or less
democratic, and workable?
On the face of it, federalism, the devolution of power to the regions, might
seem an obvious solution. As Mr R W Johnson, a political scientist at Oxford
University, points out: 'Nowhere else in the world has the democratic
government of so large and various a population even been attempted without
resort to federalism.' And it would have the advantage of accommodating
Chief Buthelezi, who poses the gravest threat to long-term stability.
Unfortunately for those who favour federalism - the government, the IFP, the
liberal Democratic Party - the concept has been discredited by decades of
apartheid, which was itself a distorted version of federalism. The guiding
principle of apartheid was that each of South Africa's peoples - white,
coloured, Indian, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Swazi,  - should be granted the right
of self-determination in their own nation state.
Given that background, it is scarcely surprising that the ANC views the
government's plans for a federal South Africa as a renewed attempt to
'divide and rule'. In a sense, they are right. For the government sees the
devolution of power to regional level as the best means of preventing
domination by a black government ruling from Pretoria.
Mr Tony Leon, the Democratic Party's constitutional expert, quotes South
African novelist Olive Schreiner to illustrate this point: 'The walls of
each (federal) state are so many barricades, each of which must be broken
down before any oppressive domination can absolutely succeed.'
Federalism takes pressure off a nascent democracy. If ethnic and tribal
minorities feel they could never win power, they would have little time for
democracy; if they can exercise power at regional level - with all the
patronage which that implies - they would be less likely to revolt.
But the ANC is suspicious of this argument, for its goal is to create a
non-racial South Africa where tribal divisions are subsumed by a single
nationhood. To accept autonomous tribal political units in a future South
Africa - many of the government's proposed federal provinces would be
dominated by a single tribe - would be to abandon this goal.
The ANC does not dismiss devolution of power out of hand. Delegations have
visited Germany and the US to study their federal systems, and ANC
constitutional experts say they favour the German model of strong state
governments. But ANC officials make clear that the goal of their regional
policy is developmental, not political. They want to redistribute resources
from rich regions to poor ones, and insist that central government must have
the power to achieve this.
The debate will rage for months. In the end, Mr Leon believes: 'Federalism
represents the most likely compromise between a specific system of racial
checks and balances on the one hand and the demand for majority rule on the
other.'
But the National Party is not content with regional devolution alone. The
government favours a form of 'consociational democracy', a political system
which involves not only devolution of power but power-sharing among various
groups at the executive level and special majorities in parliament for
certain legislation. One advocate, Mr Arend Lijphart, a political scientist,
argues that in a divided country such as South Africa (with 30m blacks, 5m
whites, 3m coloureds and 1m Indians) consociational democracy is the only
option. He points out that majority rule violates democracy by excluding
losing groups from participation, and where demography guarantees there will
be permanent losers, democracy cannot survive.
Mr Ken Owen, editor of the Sunday Times, one of South Africa's largest
newspapers, sums up the country's dilemma: 'The idea that a minority can
thwart the will of the majority . . . is not merely unacceptable but
dangerous.' But neither is majority rule the answer. 'Neither majority nor
minority can exercise any powers for which it fails to win general consent,'
he concludes. Whatever its faults, power sharing may be the only answer.

Sir, The Commission on Social Justice is grateful for all the advice it
receives, including the admonition to 'think radically' in your editorial
('Social justice', January 18). But I must stress that the commission -
although established at the initiative of the Labour party's leader, John
Smith - is an independent body working under the auspices of the independent
Institute for Public Policy Research. Our final report will not only advise
the Labour party but everyone who cares to read it.
The commission's members, who include people belonging to different
political parties and to none, are determined to make the commission as open
as possible to everyone who shares our concern with creating wider
opportunities for all in our society.
We hope that, with your assistance, our work will stimulate a wide and
well-informed public debate which will reach well beyond the membership of
any political party.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: Changes within electricity supply industry, not
subsidies to British Coal, would resolve problems faced by coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D MEADS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article on the government's ideas for subsidising the coal
industry ('Extra Time for British Coal': January 14) was based entirely on
the mistaken premise that British Coal cannot be 'saved' without substantial
subsidy. This is not the case.
It is common knowledge that the price offered by British Coal to the two big
generators is Pounds 1.51 a gigajoule for 1993-94, declining to Pounds 1.33
a gigajoule over the five years of the proposed contract. What is not such
common knowledge is that British Coal could, next year, supply 60m tonnes to
the electricity industry, at the price offered, and still make a modest
profit.
According to figures I have seen the 1993-94 cash operating cost of
production out of the 19 retained pits, plus the 21 pits under DTI review,
plus opencast, is expected to be Pounds 1.31 a gigajoule. Even allowing for
the costs of any large capital projects (not included in the definition of
cash operating costs) the output of at least some of the remaining 10 pits
could be added without British Coal falling into loss.
The problem for the coal industry is not principally one of costs and prices
 -though we still have a little further to go before we match
internationally traded coal.
The real problem is that there is insufficient room for British Coal to sell
60m tonnes of power-station coal, because of the pre-emption of the
generation market by nuclear, the French link and - especially - gas.
Nuclear's slice is protected by statute; imported French electricity should
be subject to the fossil-fuel levy, but isn't; and the new gas-fired
stations sponsored by the regional electricity companies are protected by
15-year take-or-pay contracts for their output.
Institutional changes within the electricity supply industry are what is
required, not huge subsidy to British Coal. Without institutional changes
British Coal would still be faced with an artificial ceiling on the volume
of coal it could sell, regardless of cost, price and subsidy levels.
The stories which have been circulating recently, in your paper and others,
suggesting that the government was considering giving British Coal a Pounds
10 a tonne subsidy, were clearly inspired by the Department of Trade and
Industry. They had the twin objectives of frightening people off, and
diverting attention from the real problem.
Unfortunately, you seem to have fallen for it.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: Appointments raise concern about system of
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof J D STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survey of quangos you published ('Resurgence of quangos defies
Thatcher's new broom', January 14) highlighted one important but little
discussed development - the tendency for an increasing amount of public
expenditure to be placed under the responsibility of appointed boards. One
reason for the lack of discussion is that it happens step by step, or rather
responsibility by responsibility. Discussion focuses on the particular
changes rather than on the implications for public accountability generally.
This is well illustrated by recent discussion about the proposals for police
authorities, currently being considered by the home secretary. It has been
widely reported that he is considering replacing elected councillors on
police authorities by non-appointed members, or perhaps not even
non-appointed members since they may already be serving on other appointed
boards. Discussion has naturally focused on the implications for the policy,
rather than on the implications of adding to the extent of public
expenditure under the control of appointed members. If carried through it
would be a significant increase in the Pounds 41bn which your article showed
to be the responsibility of appointed boards. The nature of the
accountability of these boards to the public is in some cases uncertain and
in other cases at best indirect and they are often not subject to the degree
of scrutiny and access for the public that we insist on for local
authorities.
The extent of public expenditure involved and the wider issues of public
accountability raised suggests the need for an examination of the role of
those appointed boards - possibly by a select committee of the House of
Commons. It would be unwise to extend the principle of government by
appointment until there is much deeper understanding of the implications of
what has already happened. The issues raised by the home secretary concern
not merely the police, but the whole system of government.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Need for a US lead: Clinton cannot escape the Iraqi and
Bosnian crises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friends and allies should not complain about the new US president's wish to
give America's domestic problems priority. If those problems are not dealt
with, it will soon be vain to hope for continued US leadership in the wider
world.
But US leadership remains indispensable, even after the cold war. That was
demonstrated both positively and negatively in 1991. Without US leadership,
the Gulf war would never have been fought. Kuwait would be still in Saddam
Hussein's clutches, and he would by now have a nuclear weapon. And without
US leadership, Europe was unable to prevent genocidal war in the former
Yugoslavia, where the US decided it had no strategic interest.
Mr Bill Clinton takes office in the midst of renewed hostilities against
Iraq, and at the moment when a Munich-like capitulation is being imposed on
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Both crises call for new thinking and bold measures.
Continuity and containment will not suffice.
Last week the then president-elect told The New York Times that, if Mr
Saddam wanted a new relationship with the US, 'all he has to do is change
his behaviour' to comply with UN requirements. Later he explained this did
not mean there was any difference between his policy and that of his
predecessor, or that he would normalise relations as long as Mr Saddam was
in power. It meant only that Mr Saddam could avoid being bombed if he did
not violate the UN ceasefire accords.
Normal relations between the US and Mr Saddam's government are indeed
scarcely imaginable, after all that has happened. The danger is that Iraq
may simply be left to stew, simultaneously terrorised by Mr Saddam's vicious
repressive apparatus and starved by economic sanctions.
It is not to be supposed that Mr Saddam would content himself with such
malign neglect. He would go on pursuing his objectives in the south with
'indiscriminate bombardments and destruction of local marsh villages and
hamlets, resulting in innumerable arrests and deaths', as the UN's special
rapporteur for human rights in Iraq reported to the General Assembly two
months ago.
Mr Saddam would go on intimidating the Kurds in the north with terrorism,
blockade and sabotage, while playing on the fears of neighbouring states
that the west's real aim is to partition Iraq and set up an independent
Kurdish state. He would go on taunting and provoking the US with new
ceasefire violations, so as to win sympathy from other Moslems and Arab
nationalists when the inevitable retaliation arrived; and would alternate
this with carefully timed pledges of good behaviour, in return for the
lifting of sanctions and restoration of his control over the whole country.
Mr Clinton must not be a sitting target for those tactics. He must expose
Saddam's phoney David-and-Goliath act by exposing him as the real Goliath.
That means indicting him and his leading henchmen for crimes against
humanity; transferring Iraq's property abroad to his democratic opponents in
the Iraqi National Congress; abandoning the UN-Iraq agreement which makes
relief for Saddam's victims dependent on his government's goodwill; ordering
and enforcing the withdrawal, not only of anti-aircraft missiles but of any
and all forces that attack Iraqi civilians or prevent supplies from reaching
them - starting with the 450 troops at Faida, well north of the 36th
parallel, which have been blocking the main supply route from Turkey to
Iraqi Kurdistan.
The need for a tough line in Iraq is one of many reasons why Mr Clinton also
needs to take a tougher line in Bosnia, thus refuting the absurd notion that
Saddam is a victim of anti-Moslem prejudice.
No one should imagine that the Serbian president or the Bosnian Serb
leadership will be bound by last week's Gen-eva agreement. Slobodan
Milosevic is imposing this agreement on the Bosnian Serbs as he imposed the
Vance Plan on the Croatian Serbs a year ago: as a way of consolidating
territorial gains and winning a breathing space from international pressure.
They will neither hand over weapons nor withdraw from territory, unless
forced to do so.
The Bosnian government, like the Czechs in 1938, is willing to fight. It
faces a fascist enemy that has been destroying villages, raping women en
masse, torturing prisoners and systematically murdering the Moslem elite.
But, like the Czechs in 1938, it cannot resist the concerted pressure of
western powers. They recognised its independence, but refused to let it buy
weapons, thereby delivering it into the hands of its heavily armed enemies.
The west will pay dearly for this organised surrender to fascism, as it did
in the 1930s. Mr Milosevic may not be a Hitler but he is a Mussolini, who if
seen to succeed will serve as a model to even more dangerous fascists, most
obviously in Russia.
The Bush administration has used European reluctance as its excuse for a
non-interventionist policy. Britain and France, but especially Britain, have
used the exposure of their troops, in a supposedly neutral humanitarian
role, as an excuse for refusing to take sides. Mr Clinton should either put
US troops alongside the Europeans and demand a change in the rules of
engagement, so that they can fight their way through to those in need of
relief; or he should insist that the UN force be withdrawn. The Bosnian
government forces could then be properly armed and given allied air cover,
to help them recover areas from which their people have been expelled.
Bosnians and Iraqis alike could fight their own battles, if the west would
give up its false neutrality between them and their butchers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICOLAS MELLERSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your story about the Mori poll into the intentions of Lloyd's Names
('Many Names 'ready to quit' ', January 16) was really rather tendentious.
Given the losses that the market has experienced and the constant
bad-mouthing that Lloyd's has had to put up with, what is truly remarkable
in the Mori survey is the finding that 80 per cent of Names have decided to
stick with it. The fact that a quarter of these have decided to increase
their commitment is the clearest possible demonstration of confidence in
what is undoubtedly going to be a very prosperous future.
More encouragement comes from the likely dramatic and gratifying reduction
in resignations. If in fact 2,000-odd members do leave in the next two
years, it will mean the number of resignations per year will be half what it
was last year. Where all of us with the future of the market at heart seem
to be failing is in our apparent inability to spread the word about the
exciting prospects for Lloyd's to others qualified to join us. It is time
for the 80 per cent with confidence in the future to speak out.

A Wagnerian figure disappears into oblivion tonight, and a third of the
British population will be there to see it. On ITV at 8.00 Inspector Morse
sets out on his 28th and last investigation, and Oxford can cease to be the
murder capital of the kingdom.
John Thaw, who plays Morse, and his sidekick Kevin Whateley (Sergeant
Lewis), have decided to call it a day, although they will probably be
tempted back for the odd Christmas special. The end of Morse is sad for an
audience which now tops 18m; sad for Central TV, which has sold it to nearly
50 countries; and sad for Beamish stout, whose sales have soared since it
began to sponsor the series.
But Morse is going out on a high note with a murder at a degree ceremony, a
script by Julian Mitchell, and a cameo performance by Sir John Gielgud.
When a Government Minister in the 1970s, Tony Benn had the satisfaction of
occupying an office in a tower block on the site of his boyhood home. He has
never really left Westminster in all his 67 years and is an ideal guide in
Snapshots (Channel 4, 9.45) in which celebrities re-visit the scenes of
their childhood.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: Ennio Marchetto - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Audiences love clowns, and the Lyric Hammersmith audience loves Ennio
Marchetto - with reason. He jokes, he juggles, he lampoons, and his show's
second half is something quite original: a long string of impersonations
achieved not with full costumes but with 2-D paper cartoon cut-outs that
enable rapid changes.
Marchetto himself is a thick-set barrel-chested Italian; and in the first
half that is what he plays, straight. He is butch and fun and a bit bizarre.
In his first sketch, he is a flamenco guitarist while also juggling pingpong
balls in and out of his mouth. Next, he juggles fruit  - but with audience
participation. He throws oranges at audience members, so accurately that he
is on aim even to a man in the upper gallery. He considers throwing eggs at
us too, but builds to a climax by juggling three oranges, a melon and the
egg, spectacularly breaking it dead on cue. Finally, he juggles flaming
torches; here the best joke is that an already half-petrified audience
half-expects him to hurl some flaming torches out into the house too.
Part Two operates on the same how-will-this-develop and
what-will-happen-next principles. Marchetti has the audience agog to know
what point he is going to make with each character cut-out, and which
character will comes next. I like it best when he is deliberately
incongruous - for example, as the Mona Lisa, in her framed portrait and
awfully bored, singing 'She's Got It.' He is dull as the Queen - he doesn't
know how to project that deadpan dowdiness - but, with a couple of quick
costume fixes before our eyes, he becomes another Queen: Freddie Mercury.
The success of Part Two depends almost entirely, however, on two kinds of
cleverness: the way he can quickly adjust one character to become another
and make a point (Queen-into-Queen, James-Bond-into-Shirley-Bassey,
the-Supremes-into-Diana-Ross-into-Michael-Jackson), and the cartoon
effectiveness of his cut-out costumes. Sometimes all there is left to watch
is Marchetti the mime, and this is harder to bear. He shows such a penchant
for drag that you no longer know who he is.
The few Part Two personae which are not female tend to be flamboyant -
Jackson, Mercury, Presley, Pavarotti. And his women are all performed
according to the eye-rolling, vermilion-lipped school of female
impersonation. (Thank God for his Piaf - very, very, short, stumpy-legged,
and getting shorter all the time.) For his encore, he does Carmen - miming
Callas's account of the Habanera but stuck in a groove on the high note: by
which time he's gone way over the top. Here, and too often when in drag,
Marchetti's not clowning but drowning.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: The director who is always in the firing line -
'You're never safe in a movie. That's its great power' Brian DePalma tells
Nigel Andrews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This man has faced more cultural firing squads than any other living Western
film-maker. Back in the 1970s Brian DePalma was stood against a wall for
using excessive violence in films like Carrie and The Fury. In the 1980s he
was fired on by feminists for abusing/mutilating women (Dressed To Kill,
Body Double). And throughout his career he has been accused of plagiarising
directors from Hitchcock (Obsession) to Eisenstein (The Untouchables).
Even when DePalma reached the seeming haven of a big-budget film of a
bestselling modern classic, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, things went wrong.
Former fans turned sudden foes, aghast to see their favourite kinetic
thriller director, the man who brought the avant-garde to Hollywood,
floundering through a mainstream movie miscast and misconceived. DePalma
retired in dismay.
But here he is again, unbowed and not visibly bloody. His new thriller,
Raising Cain, is the DePalma mixture of old: which means no one else in the
world could have made it. The camera performs trompe l'oeil gymnastics;
dream sequences are seamlessly sewn into waking ones; and DePalma himself
wrote the tale of a child psychologist (John Lithgow) trying to induce as
well as study formative traumas.
'I had the idea from a psychologist who's married to a friend of mine. They
had a daughter and when she was born he quit his practice and stayed home to
observe her and write a book. I'm fascinated by these shrinks who sit around
while people tell them what happened to them as kids. So my hero thinks, Gee
wouldn't it be great if I could go back in time and drop that scalding pan
of water on that child to see if it did turn him into the neurotic he thinks
he is.'
There are no scalding pans in Raising Cain, but little else is left out.
Drownings, stabbings, smotherings . . . But DePalma insists that violence is
part of the form.
'Ninety-nine per cent of film doesn't deal with cinema as form at all, it
just photographs people talking to each other. Or driving up to buildings or
walking down a street. So when you do explore the tricks and techniques, it
so stirs people's eyes that they think it's a distraction. They think it's
getting in the way of the characters and story. But to my way of thinking,
it is the characters and story.
'I deal with movement inside a frame and violence is a very exciting aspect
of that. It's like a crescendo in music, it disturbs people and make them
jump. Do composers get these questions about excessive violence?'
No; but blood on the ceiling, I suggest, is different from semi-breves on a
music sheet. Are not audiences legitimately shocked by the sight of, say, a
girl having her head incised by a driller killer (Body Double) or a woman
being bloodily stabbed to death in a lift (Dressed To Kill)?
'We could have long discussions about political art,' says DePalma, sensing
the agenda moving towards feminism. Still bruised by the critics who KO'd
Body Double because of one arguably misogynistic scene of violence, he
insists they were blinkered by dogma: something an artist should never be.
'As soon as a film-maker feels under an obligation to some 'ism', he's
surrendered his freedom. No art has a shorter life than political art.'
But I point out that what dismayed many of the director's fans about his
most vilified film - The Bonfire Of The Vanities - was that it did exactly
what he condemns. In strewing Tom Wolfe's story with ethnic fairmindedness
and (relative) political correctness - like changing the cranky Jewish judge
to the saintly black judge (Morgan Freeman) - he kowtowed to the liberal
lobby and emasculated the book's ferocity.
'I wouldn't say we kowtowed. I originally wanted Alan Arkin or Walter
Matthau as the judge. But there were so many negative Jewish stereotypes in
Wolfe's story already. When the budget of a movie is Dollars 40-50m you
start to worry you're going to antagonise everyone and no one's going to
come and see it.'
But no one came anyway.
'Exactly. So I should have gritted my teeth and made it the way I wanted:
which was vicious and ferocious and funny, like one of my own favourite
films The Sweet Smell Of Success. But the studio would never have agreed to
do that.'
The trouble with interviewing directors used to dawn executions is that one
ends up behaving like a firing squad oneself. Yet DePalma's career as a
whole requires no apology. In turning the movie thriller into an authentic
branch of abstract expressionism DePalma goes further than any other
commercial director in treating a movie as a thing to be shaped as lovingly
as a painting. For Raising Cain he used an architectural computer programme
to map the mise-en-scene inside buildings. And almost uniquely - Hitchcock
is the only other notable example - he storyboards whole films.
'The whole problem with most movies is, they don't fit together as an
aesthetic whole. You can't work out a film on paper in verbal description,
you have to work it out visually. There's a big white canvas up there.
Unfortunately today it's all done ass-backwards. People write scripts to
sell to studios, then they think they've solved all their aesthetic
problems.
'Television has become a major influence in this. We have a generation
brought up on TV who perceive everything through the ear. TV is basically
just radio with pictures. It's programmed so you can stand in another room
making tea and still follow the show.'
Standing in another room making tea may seem to some the best way to view
DePalma's films. If so, they miss out on modern cinema's most gleefully
heretical body of work: one that turns seeming vices to gleaming virtues and
that has a ready answer even to that most dog-eared charge,
Hitchcockophilia.
'I've taken very specific story ideas from Hitchcock. Usually from Vertigo
and Psycho, which touch me directly because they're about the things I'm
interested in: doubles, split personalities, romantic obsessions. But I
don't just quote. In Raising Cain I make one direct allusion to the scene of
the car sinking into the pond in Psycho. But that's because I'm pulling a
trick. The car with the drowning woman inside doesn't do what you've been
set up to expect. The basic tool of movies is deception and deception is the
stuff of dream. Dreams are at home in the cinema because it's the only art
that makes them seem real. Literature can't, painting can't. But in a movie
when you dream you think it's real. And when you wake up and think it's over
maybe it's still a dream or a nightmare. You're never safe in a movie.
That's its great beauty and power.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: Let enthusiasts do their own thing - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Virgin Mary appeared in Medjugorje, in what was Yugoslavia, in
1981, she was in tears. She said that she had come to pray for peace and
reconciliation in the world, and one of her repeated messages to the
innocent children who could see her was '. . . please stop watching
television.' Of course, I learned this important fact from a programme about
the Marian phenomenon which I watched . . . on television.
I always think of the Virgin Mary as being a bit like Mother Teresa, a
practical woman, and her point here was that there are a lot of more useful
things to be done in this world than watching television. I expect she was
thinking of those statistics that regularly tell us that the average person
spends some 36 hours a week watching and listening to the broadcasting media
in the UK. I was pleased to be asked to stand in for a week for Chris
Dunkley, but I was not quite prepared for the way television eats up time.
Television viewing is not something that you can easily plan: life seems to
come first. For this column I decided to watch television in the way I
normally do, often late at night, after a full day, searching for a little
relaxing balm. In fact I ended the week sitting there as though I was
determined single handedly to break the national statistics.
I even steeled myself to watch the smiling faces of the breakfast
programmes. You have to hand it to the presenters of ITV's new 'daybreak
magazine' GMTV - they do try to be relentlessly cheerful as they snuggle
together on a pink sofa in front of a blazing gas log fire and beam at you.
In a week when everything seemed to be falling, from the British monarchy to
bombs on Iraq, these presenters were determined to persuade us that the
world could still be bright and beautiful and as polished and perfect as a
room in a glossy magazine. The do not try to tax us: each item is so short
that you do not have to think about anything in depth. Saddam Hussein, John
Major, Mr Clinton with his saxophone all become part of the merry show -
they flicker and move on. The keep fit spot made me laugh with someone
called Linda Lusardi lying on the floor with the Duchess of York's personal
trainer - a very solemn American who told her to move her muscles
'bio-mechanically correctly'.
Despite this early morning punishment I survived to enjoy several programmes
and to ignore a great many more. Television is often too slow and repetitive
 -too many rolling titles and theme tunes and too much endless newschat. An
atmosphere of permanent inquisition pervades too many of the news
programmes. That must be why I like Jeremy Paxman on BBC 2's Newsnight - at
least you feel he does not take any politician too seriously. I am waiting
for him to stop smirking and burst out laughing one of these days. I just
wish he'd buy some better ties.
He had his own show last Sunday called Did you see? on BBC 2, when he
succinctly put all the nonsensical new sex education programmes into
perspective by saying that they were about as exciting as 'dancing the
lambada with the Archbishop of Canterbury'. There is a particularly awful
one on BBC 1, What shall we tell the children? I began to think the Virgin
Mary was right.
Children would have learned more about life and love from the best thing I
watched in the entire week, which was the launch programme for the new
Screen Two on BBC 2. This was a television drama written by Martin Sherman
based on 'The Summerhouse Trilogy' novels by Alice Thomas Ellis. I never
quite understood the title Clothes in the Wardrobe, but it was the story of
a young girl being pushed into an unsuitable marriage by her thoughtless
mother and being rescued at the last minute in an outrageous and very funny
way by a life enhancing visitor to the London suburb where the story is set
 -one Lili, played to the hilt by a magnificent Jeanne Moreau. The cast
included Joan Plowright as the elderly mother of the doomed bridegroom and
Julie Walters as the bride's mother. It was these three stars playing
disillusioned (especially with men) and life weary women in Croydon in the
1950s that made the film so memorable. Jeanne Moreau longing to be farouche
in the suburbs must have brought real joie de vivre into every sitting room
in the kingdom - she was magnificent and completely overshadowed everything
else on television that week.
I could not bear a new programme called The Sexual Imperative on Channel 4,
which spies on animals during their most private moments. This new sort of
voyeurism, apparently masquerading as a serious science programme about
mating habits, seemed to be to be completely bogus. Animals should be left
alone to be animals.
It is not necessary for television to trivialise. I felt that it was at its
most successful when it lets enthusiasts, even eccentric ones, convey their
passions on the screen. There are two new series that both do this, Dancing
and The Name of the Room, both on BBC 2. The first programmes look
promising.
I expected to enjoy The Name of the Room more than I did, as it deals with
architectural matters and the history of the way we use the rooms in our
houses. Dan Cruickshank introduced the first one about the bedroom and
discussed in detail the changing history of our ideas of privacy. He was
good, as was one of the participants, the excellent, re-discovered Professor
Lawrence Stone, who tried nobly to explore 'concepts of separation.' The
enemy of this series, and I felt the same in the second episode when Gillian
Darley struggled to explain the long history of the kitchen, is the director
David Turnbull who cannot resist tricky angles, predictable music, old film
clips and old advertisements that overwhelm any hope of a clear exposition
of an historical thesis. Documentary television programmes often do this.
Why do directors not realise that the simpler the programme the more
effective it is? From limited experience, I know that making a programme is
often a battle with a director who knows little about a subject and does not
realise the limitations of the camera. Tricks on television become tiresome.
Clarity lasts, and helps documentaries to spread enlightenment - which is
surely their point.
Dancing managed to use the speedy possibilities of the camera to bring out
both the humanity and skill of the dancing participants from all over the
world. It was moving to see the late Sir Kenneth MacMillan with the newer
young dancers of the Royal Ballet; you felt that although he had died much
too suddenly and much too young, he had passed on the flame. The lovely
Indian dancer, Malavika Sarukkai, who danced with her eyes as well as her
body, explained the origins of Indian classical dancing in a way that made
it all so sound completely simple and logical while being completely
different from the Western tradition. There was a memorable scene of an
Indian wedding procession dancing happily along the Edwardian back streets
of Birmingham; any incongruity was banished by the relaxed joy of the
participants. This new series promises to be both thoughtful and vibrant.
Programmes like Dancing are an antidote to the very high level of gloom,
gore and ghastliness that makes up so much of television's weekly output. I
was depressed more than a little by the appetite for tragedy of the
programme makers as well as the doom laden air of every newscast. Take the
terrifying Casualty series on BBC 1. It makes life at a National Health
Hospital look more fearful and daily closer to death than any of the
Jacobean revenge tragedies.
The prevailing tendency to portray grief and misery in large doses as part
of the daily diet was almost too much for this soft hearted novice TV
reviewer. I felt, at the end of the week, that I was at one with Jeanne
Moreau's memorable view: 'Life is too bloody awful without being unhappy.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / People: Maurice Warren to chair SWEB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Maurice Warren, who retires as chief executive of Dalgety next June at the
age of 60, has begun to look around for two or three non-executive
directorships; the first he has accepted is as deputy chairman and
chairman-designate of South Western Electricity (SWEB).
At the time of their privatisation, the regional electricity companies
tended to have an executive who combined the role of chairman and chief
executive with a managing director one rung below that. SWEB is now the
third company to split the roles, and to appoint a part-time chairman from
outside the group - conforming with current corporate fashion.
Hence, in the first of the changes, John Seed, formerly managing director,
was made chief executive before Christmas, while Bill Nicol remains chairman
until the agm in August when Warren will take over. 'We like the company
anyway, but we like it a bit more now,' was the comment of one analyst who
reckoned that Nicol had not come across particularly well in the City.
Nicol says SWEB, which engaged a firm of headhunters to make the
appointment, was looking for someone who came from the West Country - Warren
hails from Somerset and definitely has the accent to prove it - as well as
someone who had successfully led a major company through change. 'We are all
outstanding engineers but we need another perspective,' says Nicol.
In his four years at the top of Dalgety, Warren is credited with
masterminding a fundamental restructuring of the group, which he says meant
he had to keep his head down, leaving no time for any non-executive
directorships. Now he already has one or two other irons in the fire for his
retirement, though he plans to spend two days a week with SWEB.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Audubon finds new nest - Karen
Zagor explains how to create a beautiful office, save money and improve the
environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its high ceilings, skylights, picture windows and striking centre
staircase, the foyer of the US National Audubon Society's new headquarters
seems more fitting for an advertising agency than a non-profit environmental
advocacy group.
Yet the 101-year-old terracotta building in downtown Manhattan, complete
with gargoyles and Romanesque arched windows, was recently renovated at a
cost of roughly Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) to prove that it is possible to
improve the environment, create a beautiful office and save money. 'Our main
motivation was financial,' says Tom Exton, director of corporate
fundraising.
The society, which had been renting for decades, decided to buy its office
to take advantage of Manhattan's property tax exemptions for non-profit
organisations. It also benefited from New York's weak property market and
low interest loans.
Tax and borrowing advantages, plus a successful Dollars 14m fundraising
campaign, are expected to save the society nearly Dollars 1m a year. It also
had a perfect opportunity to create a blueprint for an economical, yet
environmentally sound, office.
The society first decided it would be cheaper to renovate a virtually
derelict building than to build new offices from scratch. It paid Dollars
10m for the building, an eight-story former department store turned sweat
shop designed by George Post, the architect who designed the New York Stock
Exchange. Audubon said the cost of building a new office would have been
Dollars 33m.
It teamed up with Croxton Collaborative, an architectural firm whose track
record in designing healthy buildings included three floors of offices for
the Natural Resources Defence Centre, another environmental lobby group.
Audubon and Croxton adopted a cradle-to-grave approach to evaluate each
product that came into the building from how it was made and where the raw
materials came from to what would happen to the materials after the
product's useful life.
In choosing materials for the building, three criteria were used: they
needed to make environmental sense, be easily replicated with products
available on the market and be cost effective.
'If recycled goods cost too much we didn't use them,' said Peter Berle,
Audubon's president. For example, the tiles in the hallways and bathrooms
are made from recycled crushed glass but the society decided against using
toilet-stall dividers with recycled content because the dividers could not
be found on the market.
Another consideration was the impact of the building itself on the
environment. It is estimated that buildings, with their inefficient lighting
and antiquated air conditioning and heating systems, are responsible for 25
per cent of the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons in the US, 22 per cent
of the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and 15 per cent of
acid-rain causing sulphur oxides.
Audubon and Croxton set about creating a healthy work place, since illnesses
related to poor ventilation and airborne pollutants (known as sick building
syndrome) are estimated to cost the US economy Dollars 60bn annually. Most
buildings suck in fresh air from street level. Audubon brings in its air
from the roof. Industry standards call for buildings to filter out 30 per
cent of air particles. Audubon filters out 80 per cent. Air in the building
turns over 6.3 times an hour, instead of once or twice as in most buildings.
And most of the windows can be opened.
To cut electricity costs, rooms have sensors which switch off the lights
after six minutes if there is no motion in a room. Daylight sensors read the
amount of natural light entering the windows and dim or increase the
electric lights accordingly. Lighting fixtures are suspended instead of
recessed to prevent the loss of overhead light.
Croxton knows that these techniques translate into savings. Consolidated
Edison, a local utilities company, monitored the NRDC offices for three
years and found that power consumption for lighting had been cut to less
than 25 per cent of the level deemed efficient.
'When we started doing this five years ago, there was a substantial penalty
in terms of the cost of substances available and lighting supplies,' says
Kirsten Childs, Croxton's director of interior design. 'There is still some
penalty, but what we do in terms of energy consumption pays back in five
years and after that there are savings in the region of 75 per cent.'
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the building is its floor-to-ceiling
windows. To preserve the building's original window space without
sacrificing energy efficiency, each window frame was fitted with a 'thermal
gasket' made from activated charcoal which prevents air from seeping
through.
Each window contains a sheet of chemically-treated polymer plastic
sandwiched between two panes of thermal glazing. The sheet deflects the
sun's ultra-violet radiation and helps keep the building cooler in summer.
It also reflects back the infra-red radiation from the building's own
heating, helping retain warmth in winter. Audubon says its windows have the
same insulation value as a brick wall.
To heat and cool the building, Audubon says it chose natural gas because it
is more energy efficient and cleaner than oil. Unlike standard air
conditioning systems, natural gas does not produce CFCs or sulphur dioxide
and it reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. The society decided
not to install solar panels because solar heating is not yet cost effective.
Audubon House expects to trim Dollars 100,000 a year from its energy bill by
using 68 per cent less electricity and 61 per cent less energy than a
comparable building using conventional technology. 'We tend to overlook the
fact that an enormous am-ount of energy goes into the heating, cooling and
lighting of a commercial building,' says Berle. 'This is a gold mine of
energy just wait-ing to be saved. For example, you don't need as much air
conditioning if you've improved the efficiency of the lights and the
insulation.'
For insulation, Audubon used a product called Air-Krete made from sea water
and magnesium salts which, unlike some foam insulation products, does not
emit CFCs and does not contain carcinogenic long fibres of fibreglass.
According to the society, Air-Krete's insulation value is three times as
efficient as city regulations require. It is not, however, as effective as
other less environmentally sound products.
In addition to the recycled glass in its tiles, Audubon used dry-wall made
of 25 per cent recycled gypsum and 100 per cent recycled paper. The counter
tops in the bathroom and kitchens are made from recycled plastic bottles.
The society estimates that the recycled products it used were only slightly
more expensive than more conventional alternatives and it expects prices to
fall as demand grows.
'Part of our intention in telling the world about Audubon House is to
engender a demand for green building products,' says Tom Exton. Wherever
possible, building materials were chosen that reduced or eliminated toxins.
The Glidden paint brand was used because it has no volatile organic
compounds, such as benzene and formaldehyde which are poisonous.
Plywood was avoided because pressed wood products are glued together with
solvents which emit formaldehyde. For the sub-flooring, Homasote, made from
recycled newsprint, was used instead.
Audubon estimates its renovation costs were equivalent to those of a
conventional building because it spent less on non-essential materials such
as brass and marble.
The money-saving message of energy conservation is starting to filter
through to more mainstream organisations. 'This is not a fad,' says Childs.
'You might expect an Audubon Society or the NRDC to do this but we are
working for Home Box Office and Veriphone and talking to other companies.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / People: Sweet talking for bankers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when the reputation of British banks has sunk about as low as it
can, the British Bankers' Association has hired the services of American
Catherine Sweet for the newly created post of director, communications and
external affairs.
The appointment is part of the response to a survey commissioned from
Professor Ian Morison of Loughborough University by the BBA which last June
concluded that the banks were poor at lobbying, could no longer expect the
Bank of England always to spring to their defence, and consequently needed a
hard-hitting trade association to weigh in on their behalf.
Pauline Hedges, BBA's press and information manager, stays in charge of
press relations - 'a full-time job' she stresses - but 38-year-old Sweet
will pull together external relations, for instance improving the
association's lobbying performance. At Westminster, the BBA's record has
been one of 'winning many battles but losing several wars', Morison
commented at the time.
Sweet, who will no doubt find plenty of new material for the satirical poems
on the City that she has been known to pen, has some schooling in crisis
management having been deputy head of public affairs at the London Stock
Exchange during Big Bang, where she also worked on the Financial Services
Act. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of TSB Group and president of the BBA
since last year, says it is 'happy coincidence rather than anything else'
that Sweet has worked for him before when he was chairman of the Stock
Exchange.
In 1988 Sweet moved to Charterhouse merchant bank followed by a stint at
Burson-Marsteller. She had turned freelance last November.
Credited with being bright, aggressive and not afraid to make enemies, Sweet
completed a D Phil in international relations from Oxford, while she was at
the Stock Exchange.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Marriage broker proposes
recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One man's rubbish is another man's treasure, or in these days of waste
recycling, another company's raw material. This is the philosophy behind
Green Base Exchange, an information service on environmental issues and a
business-to-business swap shop for materials which can be recovered and
recycled.
Ingenious in its simplicity, the Green Base Exchange - based in the UK
county of Essex - acts as a 'marriage' broker between companies seeking
items as diverse as double glazing frames and ballpoint pens and those
wishing to dispose of the same.
Subscribers to the on-line exchange leave details of the material on offer,
its volume, storage and collection arrangements, together with a contact
name and telephone number. Other subscribers look through the industrial
categories for materials they want and can either contact the company direct
or leave a message.
The exchange works through an electronic bulletin board system and can be
accessed by anyone with a personal computer and modem. Behind the screens is
environmentalist David Cooper. A one-time adviser to the Prince of Wales'
Youth Business Trust and development consultant for new businesses in the
1980s, Cooper soon became aware of an information gap on environmental
issues and their impact on small business.
He noted that the wealth of information coming from the Department of Trade
and Industry, the Department of the Environment and the European Commission
often does not impinge on small businesses, which generally hold a negative
view of environmental directives and legislation.
The difficulty was in translating the available information and conveying it
in a meaningful, useful way. The way forward came in the form of an article
on a Dutch Waste Exchange, printed in the Financial Times in March 1991.
Inspired by the Dutch experience in recovering and recycling waste material,
Cooper was encouraged to develop his ideas - combining his interests in
technology and the environment.
The exchange also offers a news service encompassing environmental events,
legislation and details of green products and services. Green Base is easy
to access and unlike some on-line systems does not involve lengthy and
costly 'distractions' - the subscriber can quickly and easily find the
relevant section and information.
Everything is signposted and clearly labelled - the nine industrial waste
classifications are those used by the EC and there is a 'help' service and
back-up. Updated twice weekly, the exchange's news system is just that -
full of news on upcoming events, latest environmental developments and 'how
to' advice on implementing governmental and EC directives.
The software has recently been developed to incorporate listings from
environmental yearbooks as well as information on joint ventures, energy,
fuels and recycling groups.
The exchange has held a series of meetings with the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Department of the Environment to discuss promoting the
exchange to a wider audience.
According to Cooper, the departments have been willing to help on promotion
and co-ordination.
As a result, contacts have been expanded to include the Warren Springs
Research Laboratory and the British Museum, which both receive a suprisingly
high number of callers requesting information on environmental issues. This
is largely the result of a lack of policy co-ordination on environmental
issues in many companies, small and large, a situation the DTI is anxious to
rectify.
Subscription rates to the exchange start from Pounds 80 a year for a
non-business single subscription, rising to Pounds 320 for trade and
professional associations. Monthly rates are also available. There are no
other charges for being on-line or accessing and downloading information
from the exchange and the only extra cost is British Telecom's connection
charges.

FT  20 JAN 93 / People: Barkshire follows property interests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Barkshire (right), the former chairman of Mercantile House who has
hardly been heard of in the City since his 1980s-style financial services
conglomerate was sold to the now collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth in 1987,
is joining the board of TR Property Investment Trust (TRPIT) as a
non-executive director.
Also on the board of Sun Life, Savills and the Household Mortgage
Corporation, Barkshire, 58, says it is the 'remarkable cross-section' of
financial and property interests, the two areas to which he has largely
devoted his career, that attracts him on to the board of the trust, which
has total assets of just Pounds 105m.
But Barkshire is a catch for TRPIT; for one thing, 'John's knowledge of how
government departments are thinking is very valuable to us', according to
director Peter Duffy. Barkshire learnt the ropes in Whitehall not least as
chairman of the Barkshire committee, which has tried to interest the
government in single property ownership trusts, but has so far fallen at the
tax hurdle.
Three non-executive directors had retired in the last two and a half years
from TRPIT, but Duffy says he had been in no hurry to replace them, the
search being partly interrupted by TRPIT's hostile, and ultimately
successful, bid for New England Properties.
Barkshire, one of the prime movers behind the establishment of Liffe and
hailed at the time of the Mercantile House sale as a great strategic thinker
who would re-emerge to do yet greater things, now claims he knew then he did
not want 'even to try' to become chief executive or full-time chairman of
another big company.
What he thinks the City really needs is a 'strategic look at its future,
reporting back straight to the governor of the Bank of England and the
Chancellor. If London does not take the threat seriously,' he goes on, 'it
is in real danger of finding business ebbing away to other financial
centres.' He says, not entirely convincingly, that he thinks he is not the
right person to embark on such a project.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: Aids enters the office - Barbara Harrison
explains how US companies are learning to deal with HIV-positive employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Deloisio, a sales representative at Digital Equipment Corporation, the
second largest US computer maker, knew for nine years that he was HIV
positive before he revealed his condition to colleagues at work.
'I was too scared,' he says now, to disclose that he was infected with the
virus that causes Aids. 'I read about cases of people who would lose their
jobs and (health) insurance. They would basically be left out in the cold. I
didn't want that to happen to me.'
Luckily for Deloisio, Digital's management was one of the corporate pioneers
in instituting an enlightened education and advisory programme on HIV and
Aids. Begun in 1987, the programme includes seminars that explain the
disease. Employees are told, for example, that they will not be infected by
using the same tools, telephones, computer terminals or toilets.
By 1991, Deloisio felt confident that the myths and fears about HIV and Aids
had abated sufficiently among his colleagues to disclose his condition. His
departmental managers responded by restructuring his job to take account of
his need for medical treatment.
Paul Ross, Digital's manager of its HIV/Aids programme, believes that
alleviating the fears of infected and uninfected alike is crucial to avoid
workplace problems. 'We made a conscious effort to manage our response to
the epidemic instead of having it manage us.'
Company officials concede, however, that some fears or intolerance are not
diminished by education. But Digital's approach is as farsighted and
praiseworthy as it is uncommon. Over the past decade, most businesses have
ignored the epidemic. Or they have sought to rid themselves of employees
they knew or suspected were infected - a practice made illegal in the US
last year under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
But about 1m Americans are infected with Aids, which is the second biggest
cause of death for men aged 25-44 and the sixth leading cause for women aged
25-44. And that age group comprises more than 50 per cent of the US
workforce.
More than two-thirds of companies with between 2,500 and 5,000 employees and
nearly one in 12 companies with fewer than 500 employees have had an
employee with HIV or Aids.
In response, the US Centres for Disease Control launched a 'Business
Responds to Aids' programme last month. The programme, backed by companies
such as Levi Strauss, Polaroid, Federated-Allied, Coca Cola, and MGM/UA
Communications, urges firms to join an education and prevention effort.
The CDC has prepared a manager's kit and a labour leader's kit to provide
step-by-step guidance on how to develop an HIV/Aids policy and an education
programme. The kits contain advice on health insurance issues as well as
counselling and educational resources.
It also features a section on the 'do's and 'don't's under the ADA. For
example:
Companies cannot refuse to hire an applicant with HIV or Aids because their
insurance costs may rise.
Job applicants cannot be required to take an HIV test.
Companies cannot dismiss employees with HIV or Aids if they are able to
perform the 'essential functions' of a job given 'reasonable accommodation'
of their disability.
The CDC's effort to help businesses educate their workforces, and in so
doing help prevent the spread of the disease, may be laudable, but it is
expected to be an uphill battle.
Lee Smith, former president of Levi Strauss's international operations and
now chairman of the Washington-based National Leadership Coalition on Aids,
an educational organisation focusing on business, recommends that, given
staff turnover and transfers, Aids awareness programmes run continuously and
be updated with new information.
But he warns that Aids education 'is not an easy sell. There are terrible
barriers around this disease,' says Smith, who noted that one in 25 people
in Levi Strauss's San Francisco workforce was HIV positive. He said
managers, the majority of whom are heterosexual men and some of whom are
homophobic, deny it's a problem and believe it won't affect them.
Smith says he first attempts to persuade managers to institute an Aids
education and prevention programme on moral grounds. If that fails, he
argues the case on the basis of costs, comparing the small amount required
for a programme with the high cost of treatment.
For US companies, which face soaring health care costs, such arguments are
compelling. Insurance premiums increase if an employee becomes infected with
HIV, as is the case with any serious long-term illness.
At Digital, which is self-insured, Ross believes that the Aids programme has
helped contain health care costs through early treatment and through helping
to stem the spread of the disease. With average costs for treatment from
diagnosis to death running at about Dollars 100,000, 'if we've saved 10 from
becoming ill, we've saved a Dollars 1m,' he said.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: GrandMet toughens options criteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestled inside the 1992 Grand Metropolitan annual report circulated this
week are details of tough new criteria for executive share options.
At the company's AGM next month, shareholders will be asked to approve a
scheme which requires the GrandMet share price to have out-performed the
FTSE-100 index for more than three years before any option can be exercised.
In a corporate governance statement in the annual report, Richard Giordano,
GrandMet's deputy chairman and chairman of the appraisal and remuneration
committee, says the scheme 'provides a proper balance between motivating and
rewarding management on the one hand and protecting shareholder interests on
the other'.
GrandMet's previous executive share option schemes, adopted in 1983, are now
up for renewal. The company argues that the schemes 'materially contributed'
to its success and should continue.
Its two new schemes could trigger the issue of up to 205m shares over the
10-year life of the options, or 10 per cent of current equity.
In the past, any increase in the share price over the three years allowed
executives to exercise their options at the price at which the option was
given to them. Under the new criteria, the option at the original price can
only be exercised if GrandMet's share price not only beats the FTSE-100, but
also is maintained above the index for at least six months over a period of
three years - to remove the effect of any short-term fluctuations.
If this has not been achieved in the first five years after the options are
granted, then the shares must beat the index over five years.
The scheme appears to echo the guidelines issued last September by the
National Association of Pension Funds, Britain's largest shareholder group.
It argued that there was concern over whether earnings per share  - the
usual key criterion for options - were a reliable indicator of corporate
performance.
Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, welcomed the
proposals as one of the first to meet its guidelines.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Management: Europe starts to face HIV issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS, DAVID BUCHAN and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European-based companies have been slower than their US counterparts in
establishing policies to deal with employees who are HIV positive or have
Aids, write Paul Abrahams in London, David Buchan in Paris and Christopher
Parkes in Frankfurt.
One of the main reasons is that the disease has spread more slowly in Europe
than North America. In the UK, for example, 3,995 people have died of Aids
since 1982.
'HIV and Aids is a new issue in Europe, and only a small number of employees
have so far been involved,' said Glenys Rowe, an independent consultant on
HIV and Aids implications for business.
Companies that addressed the problem early have mostly been branches of US
multinationals or UK-based groups with subsidiaries in Africa and Asia.
Public services such as police, fire and ambulance brigades also have
policies.
However, Rowe says that large and even small and medium-sized groups are now
beginning to look at the issue. She says it is important for companies to
prepare in advance. Some companies, for example, have been placed in the
difficult position of taking disciplinary action against an employee for
absenteeism and then it being revealed during a hearing that he or she is
HIV positive.
About half of the companies that consider adopting a policy for HIV do not
do so, but incorporate the issue into existing health policies. A special
policy would lead to discrimination, they fear. An effective policy would
prevent discrimination in recruitment and continued employment, and counter
victimisation by work colleagues. Rowe says a catalogue exists of terrible
cases of victimisation. Organisations must prepare through education
programmes to counter misconceptions about how the disease is spread.
One of the most encouraging signs, she believes, is the launch of the UK
Corporate HIV &amp; Aids Project. This has linked the leading Aids charities
with companies such as IBM UK, Unilever, Body Shop, Kingfisher, Wellcome and
Marks &amp; Spencer. The project's aim is to produce a number of briefing sheets
on a variety of policy issues when considering the impact of HIV and Aids on
businesses.
In France, companies still focus on preventing the spread of Aids, rather
than organising for a future in which a sizeable proportion of the workforce
may be HIV positive.
But even on prevention, a degree of corporate complacency exists which is
surprising given that ministerial responsibility for the infection of
haemophiliacs with Aids-contaminated blood has been a big political issue in
recent months.
When the French Agency for the Fight against Aids recently surveyed more
than 1,000 company personnel directors, they found that one in 10 firms had
employees carrying the HIV virus. One in four companies had carried out
prevention/information programmes.
But the 80 per cent of companies which had not so far introduced any
specific programme said they saw no reason to do so in the future. Yet
two-thirds of those interviewed also said that for companies to relay
information on Aids to their staff was appropriate.
Companies with a relatively large number of white-collar employees tended to
be more active on Aids information, while those in the building sector were
most passive, not to say hostile, on the issue.
In Germany, infection rates grow steadily, but Aids and the HIV virus remain
issues of concern to sociologists and statisticians rather than managers -
or employees.
In the year to last September, federal authorities recorded 1,050 new Aids
cases, taking the total to 8,760 among the 53,500 people registered as
infected with the HIV virus. Exhaustive research in the years since 1986,
when the government started a national 'Give Aids no chance' advertising
campaign, has uncovered dwindling concern among the population.
Evidence has tended to confirm popular convictions that the risks are
minimal for heterosexuals who do not inject drugs, are not among the
estimated 1.6m men who regularly visit a German brothel, and do not holiday
in Thailand and other 'sex-tourist' hot-spots.
According to the latest statistics, homosexual or bisexual men account for
65 per cent of new Aids diagnoses and drug addicts for 15 per cent. New
diagnoses attributed to infection through heterosexual intercourse in the
year to last September numbered fewer than 100.
That the proportion of cases confirmed among this group has more than
trebled in the past five years has gone almost unremarked.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Jobs: Better than being good in a crisis - Progress in
developing computerised test of an ability highly useful in many types of
work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST suppose, if such isn't your job already, that your living depends on
achieving top-class results to tight deadlines, whatever fate may betide.
Which of the following kinds of workmates would you rather have in support?
A - Those who're good in a crisis. B - People who prevent crises from
happening in the first place, by anticipating likely problems and ensuring
they don't arise.
Except madcap youths, slaves to routine and masochists, all of us would
surely prefer B: problem- anticipators. So the omens look good for
psychologist Clive Thacker of Wolverhampton University.
Although a specialist in psychometric tests, he has doubts about an
assumption made by most recruiters who use them. It is that job requirements
can be broken down into shopping lists of intellectual and personality
traits measurable by standard yardsticks: for example, so much skill at
mentally manipulating information expressed in words, plus so much at
manipulating numerical data, plus such a degree of pushiness . . .and so on.
In his view, adding testable traits together in that way is incapable of
giving an accurate gauge of the vast complexity of human talents. He is
therefore focusing his research, not on general measures of personality and
the like, but on developing a computerised test of one specific ability
important in many jobs: that of anticipating problems.
The prototype combines three elements. The first is a 15-item questionnaire
assessing people's disposition to think ahead, a yardstick which Dr Thacker,
who switched career to psychology in his early 30s, devised in the course of
his doctoral studies. The next checks speed of mental reaction. Then comes a
test of ability to think logically about cause and effect.
All the elements, he says, are 'modelled to interact dynamically' - a feat
which I gather is in its way not far short of the soccer star's legendary
achievement of opening a can of peas with his left foot. The whole gauntlet
can be run in 30 minutes or so.
As for the test's benchmark of problem-anticipating excellence, thereby
hangs a tale. Clive Thacker's particular interest in the ability dates from
the 12 years he served on the production staff of professional theatre
companies, working his way up from assistant stage manager.
In that kind of job, he explains, the governing principle is not just Sods
Law's ruling that if anything can go wrong, it will. Actors are typically so
'disaster-prone' that, even if it can't go wrong, they'll somehow fix for it
to do so. Nor are the dangers thereof limited to distracting the audience
from the plot.
'When we did the Caucasian Chalk Circle up in Newcastle, we had two 25ft
towers on stage and the cast had to make a rope bridge between them, which
the leading lady walked across. That put us on a potential of a death a
night. And though there are always plenty of actors looking for work, women
who can play big Brechtian roles are rare.'
Having come through a dozen years of such exposure without even a small
disaster to his debit, Dr Thacker thinks he has proved himself a
problem-anticipator of high degree. And his score on the test, 96, is the
best yet achieved.
But that is far from his only reason for confidence that the instrument is
sound. By standard statistical checks, the evidence from the several dozens
of people tested to date is encouraging. Even so, much refining work is
still needed, and Clive Thacker would like to hear from any organisation
interested in helping with further development.
The Jobs column has already done its bit by becoming another guinea pig,
scoring 79. So I can claim my problem-anticipating ability is at least
average . . . although my partner Bill Hall says it would be better
described as 'just about tolerable'.
W
HENCE to the table along- side, which tells the sad tale of events in the
United Kingdom executive-employment market as gauged by the MSL
International consultancy's three-monthly counts of jobs advertised in the
more highbrow journals.
As may be seen from the line of totals three quarters of the way down, last
year's advertised demand fell 10 per cent short of even the record low of
1991. So much for the optimistic hopes I expressed 12 months ago]
The previous worst in MSL's 33 years of checking, by the way, was the 1981
tally of 18,795.
The separate three-monthly counts under the totals scarcely point to early
recovery either. Although the first three quarters of 1992 brought a slowing
of the market plunge from the rates of the year before, it steepened again
in the final quarter. The only comfort the consultancy can offer is that
October was worse than November which in turn was worse than December.
Still, to quote the poet Arthur Hugh Clough's brave words on the failure of
previous optimism, 'if hopes were dupes, fears may be liars'. Whatever the
totals may say, I'm banking on the two plus signs in the upper part of the
table for 1992, especially the one against sales and marketing where demand
has improved for the second quarter running.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM scorns utilities' windfall tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S plan for a windfall tax on privatised utilities was brushed off by
Mr John Major yesterday as a product of the 'anti-business' thinking of the
1960s and 1970s, Philip Stephens writes.
But as the gas, telephone, water and electricity companies escape the chill
of the recession, Labour believes its proposal to claw back their 'excess'
profits will strike a chord with the electorate.
The plan - presented yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor -
starts from the premise that the regulatory authorities have been
ineffectual in holding the profits of the utilities to a sensible level.
Mr Brown drew a parallel with the windfall tax imposed on the banks by the
Conservative government in 1981. Lord Howe, who was then chancellor, judged
that the banks had been unfairly shielded from the impact of the early 1980s
recession.
The cumulative profits of the utilities in the four years to 1992-93 will
amount to more than Pounds 35bn, Labour estimates. Since 1989-90 they will
have jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 10.5bn a year.
That contrasts with a severe squeeze on most corporate profits. Labour
concludes that the utilities have been unfairly cushioned by their pricing
structures and by the monopoly nature of their markets.
The party's calculations suggest that rates of return running at 11 per cent
or so for the water companies and at over 20 per cent for British Telecom
are out of line with the risk faced by the industries and with their
investment needs. Mr Brown will not put a figure on the 'excess', but one
suggestion is that it ranges from a minimum of Pounds 500m to perhaps as
much as Pounds 2.5bn.
Mr Major stressed that the regulatory authorities could curb 'excess'
profits by forcing lower prices, as in the case of British Telecom.
But Mr Brown judges that the initial popularity of the privatised utilities
has given way to resentment at their profits. He may have made also a
blunter assessment: it is easier to propose taxing BT's profits than to
suggest raising income tax.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges jobs strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday dropped its controversial election plans for higher income
tax and national insurance contributions as it called on the government to
put a new employment and investment strategy at the heart of its March 16
Budget.
In a shift signalling that the party has learnt the lesson of four
consecutive defeats, Mr John Smith said that an emergency programme to
tackle unemployment and boost investment could be financed largely by a
windfall tax on privatised utilities. Additional revenue could be raised by
deferring the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions and closing a
number of tax loopholes.
The package marks the first stage in a move by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, to shift the debate away from his party's tax and spending plans
to its long-term strategy of improving industrial competitiveness.
In a series of speeches over coming weeks he is expected to identify
education, training and investment in infrastructure and industry as the
core priorities of a future Labour government.
He will argue that debates over the level of the borrowing requirement or
the exchange rate distract attention from the central weakness of the
economy: a failure to invest in the nation's productive capacity and in its
workforce.
He is expected to signal that the party can no longer pre-occupy itself with
arcane philosophical debates over the roles of capital and labour and the
line between the public and private sectors.
Labour's more immediate priority is to contrast its call for a firm offer of
work or training for all those out of work for a year or more with the
government's intention to weaken its guarantees for 1m unemployed people
aged between 16 and 24.
Rejecting the concept of 'make-work' programmes, Mr Brown said the principle
behind government employment and training schemes should be that they
contribute to economic efficiency.
He called for a series of other Budget initiatives including the offer of
financial help to small companies. He demanded also that local authorities
be allowed to release more of their existing capital receipts to help
restore confidence in the construction industry.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rescue plan may fall foul of EC
rules - Andrew Hill and David Lascelles report on a dilemma over state aid
for the mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may have to accept
tough deadlines imposed by the European Commission for phasing out any
subsidies he includes in his rescue plan for the coal industry.
Officials are studying how a UK coal subsidy might fit in with EC policies
limiting state aid following Mr Heseltine's visit to Brussels last week. The
difficulty is that the EC's position is not clear, with the commission's
energy and competition directorates on conflicting courses over how to sort
out the community's heavily subsidised energy market.
The meetings which Mr Heseltine held with Mr Abel Matutes, the new energy
commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition commissioner, were
a prelude to high-level political negotiations on coal subsidies which will
begin after he tables his rescue plans next month.
Such negotiations could provide a fascinating spectacle. For the last four
years Sir Leon Brittan, the determinedly anti-subsidy commissioner who
preceded Mr Van Miert, has sparred with socialist-governed member states
such as France over the sensitive issue of state aid. It will be interesting
to see how a determinedly anti-subsidy government fares against a socialist
commissioner in the same debate.
Under new draft rules for state subsidies - which will come into force from
next year if the member states approve them - inefficient coal mines would
have to bring their production costs in line with the community average, or
lose their right to aid.
Energy officials believe that, under these rules, Mr Heseltine should be
able to subsidise UK mines, which are the most efficient in the EC. It is
the high-cost, heavily subsidised pits in Germany and Spain which would have
to work hard to improve efficiency.
But Mr Heseltine's plan to support the coal industry might fall foul of
guidelines observed by the commission's competition authorities. Under these
non-binding criteria, introduced at the time of the privatisation of the UK
electricity industry in 1990, Brussels allows member states to protect up to
20 per cent of their indigenous energy sources through subsidies or supply
contracts signed with electricity generators. The aim is to underpin
security of supply, but without distorting the growing market for
cross-border sales of electricity.
It is a unique part of the commission's policy on state aid in that the size
of subsidy member states can grant to these protected industries is
unrestricted. But the policy hamstrings Mr Heseltine because the UK is
already up against the 20 per cent limit. The main recipient, according to
the Department of Trade and Industry, is state-owned Nuclear Electric which
accounts for 13 per cent of electricity generated, followed by Scottish
Nuclear (4 per cent), the Longannet coal mine in Scotland (3 per cent) and a
fractional amount for renewable forms of power such as wind and solar power.
If the commission enforced the guidelines strictly in the British case, it
might be put in the strange position of hastening the demise of the most
efficient pits in the community, ostensibly in the interests of protecting
community energy sources.
When UK and commission officials meet in the next fortnight to discuss the
options, they will look for ways of skirting round this dilemma. The
commission, for example, may drop its insistence that renewable energy
sources should be counted as part of Britain's allowance. If the commission
then permits a consumer levy on electricity bills to support the coal
industry, the size of Britain's energy subsidies will increase to nearly 30
per cent of the market.
In return, partly to save the 20 per cent aid principle, the commission
would expect Mr Heseltine to reduce the scope of aid to the nuclear
industry, and to set strict time-limits on coal subsidies - perhaps
abolishing them as early as the end of 1995.
But he would find it hard to agree to these demands. There is little room to
cut aid to the nuclear power industry because of the need to build up
provisions to finance the decommissioning of old nuclear power stations.
The 1995 deadline would impose a much tighter time limit than Mr Heseltine
is believed to have in mind. Only a small number of additional mines would
be able to achieve commercial viability in that short time. More time might
also be needed to get British Coal into a condition where it could be
privatised, which is still Mr Heseltine's aim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST Pounds 800m of the housing benefit available to council tenants in
England will be funded by other tenants next year, according to figures
highlighted by Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich.
Mr Raynsford said the amount of housing benefit which had to be found from
council tenants had risen from Pounds 200m in 1990-91 to Pounds 792m in
1993-94. This represented an average of Pounds 3.85 per week for every
council tenant, and meant that in most local authorities' areas tenants
would have to make some contribution, he added.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery campaign for charity status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to make the government change its proposals for a national
lottery and to give the organisation charitable status won backing from Tory
MPs yesterday.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative chairman of the Commons home affairs
committee, was among Tories endorsing the National Lottery Campaign. The
campaigners argue that charitable status will make the national lottery
independent of government and ensure its exemption from taxation.
The heritage department argues that there would be no benefits from
charitable status.
The campaign was accompanied by signs of friction among Labour MPs, who were
keen to oppose the lottery proposals. About 110 Labour MPs have written to
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, calling on the opposition party to oppose the
national lottery bill when it is debated in the Commons on Monday.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major hints at benefit changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday hinted that changes to social security rules aimed
at helping the unemployed might be included in the Budget, David Owen
writes.
With pressure for a large-scale jobs package set to mount in the wake of
tomorrow's monthly unemployment figures, Mr Major described remarks made by
Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, as 'well worth
considering'.
His comments came as Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, played down
the prospect of the wholesale adoption of Workfare - obliging people to work
in return for benefit - saying it was 'an extremely expensive solution' to
Britain's jobs difficulties.
Mrs Shephard said on BBC radio that the government needed 'a whole range of
measures which keep people in touch with the world of work, because it is
productive and gives them hope'. She said she remained 'open-minded' about
ways of keeping people 'in touch with the world of work'.
Workfare is one area under consideration by a cabinet committee recently set
up by Mr Major under Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, to suggest schemes
to tackle unemployment.
A report from Full Employment UK, a policy consultancy, is due to reach the
prime minister this week. It estimates that the cost of operating an
obligatory scheme to take 400,000 long-term unemployed off the dole queue
would be more than Pounds 630m.
Mr Rooker, a frontbench education spokesman, urged Mr Major to ease rules on
social security benefits so that unemployed people with 'household
responsibilities' could 'genuinely' take advantage of opportunities to
improve their education and training.
Accepting Mr Rooker's point was worth considering, the prime minister said:
'We have looked in the past at some matters related to that; these are the
sort of matters that we are prepared to examine.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Consensus on Iraq action weakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CRACKS in the cross-party consensus over Iraq yesterday prompted a clear
signal from Downing Street that Mr John Major had used his influence to
limit the scale of military action against Baghdad.
As senior ministers rallied behind the prime minister, officials hinted that
the prime minister had successfully persuaded President George Bush to
exercise restraint when the targeting and timing of air raids were discussed
in a series of telephone calls last weekend.
In spite of the assurances, however, the government yesterday refused to
rule out sending British troops to Kuwait, but pledged that any such
deployment, if it occurred, would be limited and in close conformity with
United Nations agreements.
Downing Street underlined that no such request had yet been received from
the Kuwaitis. Nonetheless, it was pointed out that the UK had signed a
defence co-operation agreement with the Gulf state in February last year.
In a tacit acknowledgement of widespread disquiet among MPs of all parties
over continuing military action, the government also granted an emergency
Commons debate on the recent events in the region and the RAF's role in
military missions. It is scheduled for tomorrow.
As US aircraft were again in action over the northern Iraq no-fly zone, Mr
Major insisted at prime minister's question time that the UK would act only
in accordance with international law in co-operation with its coalition
partners and with the minimum necessary force.
But his assurances did little to dispel mounting anxiety in the Commons that
Britain may be drawn into a new Gulf war at a time when Russia, France,
Italy and several Arab states which backed the 1990 conflict are expressing
deep misgivings over Gulf policy.
Yesterday evidence of growing dissent at home also emerged. For Labour, Mr
Jack Cunningham, the foreign affairs spokesman, said it was 'time for a
pause' in military action to allow the UN security council to assess the
situ-ation.
The Liberal Democrats also sought a special meeting of the security council
and George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, interrupted a tour of South
Africa to urge caution.
Backbenchers were more vocal with several leftwing Labour MPs using points
of order in the Commons to press for a right to amend the government's
motion for debate. Mr Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East, said the stance of
new MPs elected at the last general election meant a majority of the party
opposed 'this military escapade'.
More seriously for the government, many Tory MPs were yesterday urging
extreme care before any further engagements are agreed. Mr David Howell,
Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said that while the
government still commanded overwhelming support, 'people want an explanation
of the end-game.'
A senior official stressed that reaching an accord among the coalition
partners was 'a delicate exercise', adding that no action would be taken
without the full approval of the UN and the agreement of Arab coalition
members.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brewing review plan abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has abandoned plans for a full review of the effects of the
beer orders on the brewing industry. The orders, in the wake of a 1990
Monopolies Commission report, obliged big brewers to dispose of some pubs
and to accept 'guest' beers as a way of safeguarding independent brewers.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that it
was 'highly desirable that both brewers and pub tenants should now have a
period of stability.'
The full effect of changes, brought about by the Monopolies and Mergers
report and commercial pressures, would only gradually become apparent, Mr
Heseltine told the Commons agriculture committee.
A full scale review later this year, as originally planned, would further
prolong uncertainty in the industry.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, would continue to
monitor the market and would investigate any evidence of anti-competitive
behaviour, he said.
But a full review would be left to the European Commission which is due to
re-examine the effects of exclusive 'tied' beer supplies to pubs and clubs
in 1997.
National brewers, who have had to sell or lease nearly 12,000 pubs to comply
with the beer orders, last night welcomed the decision. 'This is very good
news,' said Allied-Lyons.
However, Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the London
brewer, said: 'I do not think that it is right to leave the review to
Brussels alone.'
Evidence by the Department of Trade and Industry to the committee said the
MMC believed the beer market had become more competitive after the beer
orders.
The freeing of 12,000 pubs - a third of the national brewers' estates - had
significantly reduced the proportion sold through tied outlets. The free pub
trade now accounted for 49 per cent of beer sales compared with 37 per cent
in 1989.
Mr Heseltine told the committee that while the retail price of beer had
risen an average 13 per cent a year between 1989 and 1992, the increase over
the last 12 months had been less than 1 per cent.
These claims brought a sceptical response from Sir Jerry Wiggin, the
committee chairman. He said the industry picture 'was not a happy one'.
Mr Heseltine said it was difficult to distinguish between the effects of the
recession and of the beer orders in many changes that had occurred.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht debate curtailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics claimed a tactical victory last night
after ministers decided not to try to continue debate on the Maastricht bill
into the early hours of this morning.
Instead of arranging for the debate to run late in order to make progress on
the legislation, the government ended the sixth day of detailed discussion
of the bill at the usual time. This contrasted with Monday night when a
marathon session of debate had run on well into Tuesday morning.
While Labour wanted to ensure that the European social dimension is
discussed at a sensible time today, the Euro-sceptics were content to have
caused a delay. Earlier they pointed out there was no need to rush, since
the final Commons stage would not be until after the second Danish
referendum.
Tory Euro-enthusiasts dismissed the rebels' success as a 'pyrrhic victory',
but Mr Michael Spicer, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, said the government
would have been defeated if it had tried to continue the debate.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, said the move was
a good example of organised and constructive opposition.
In the wake of last night's co-operation there was hope among some MPs that
Labour and the Euro-sceptics might combine today over a Labour amendment to
exclude the protocol on the social chapter, which contains the UK's opt-out.
Labour put this forward because it objects to the opt-out but some
Euro-sceptics argue that they should support the amendment because it would
wreck the bill.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils win cash concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL councils in England will be allowed to spend an extra Pounds 150m next
year above the government's original expenditure plans. The concession stems
mainly from a revision of how spending should take account of authorities'
losing responsibility for further education.
While the amount is relatively small compared with the overall planned
spending for local government in England of just over Pounds 41bn, it could
be critical in enabling some councils to escape the formal 'capping' process
through which the government limits local budgets.
Authorities benefiting most include Kent, which receives an increase of
Pounds 16.3m; Cheshire, with an increase of just over Pounds 12m; and
Nottinghamshire, up by almost Pounds 9m.
Altogether, 23 councils have received increases of more than Pounds 3m in
the amounts the government says they can spend. In London, the largest
increase is to Camden (Pounds 4.2m).
Mr John Redwood, local government minister, said yesterday that the changes
had been made on the basis of new and more accurate information.
The move follows about 200 representations to ministers from councils. When
the plans were first announced in November last year, local authorities
warned that the government's intended deduction of Pounds 2.4bn from local
spending to reflect the switch of further education was too much.
Ministers expect the main opposition attack to be over the level of
settlement rather than the nature of the council tax. They are hopeful,
however, that a significant proportion of threatened job losses in local
government will come from natural wastage.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery status divides MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to make the government change its proposals for a national
lottery and to give the organisation charitable status won backing from Tory
MPs yesterday.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative chairman of the home affairs select
committee, was among Tories who endorse the National Lottery Campaign. The
campaigners argue that charitable status will make the national lottery
independent of government and ensure its exemption from taxation.
The Department of Heritage argues that there would be no benefits from
charitable status.
The campaign was accompanied by signs of friction among Labour MPs, who were
concerned to oppose the lottery proposals. About 110 Labour MPs have written
to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, calling on the opposition party to oppose
the national lottery bill when it is debated in the Commons on Monday.
The letter says the national lottery will affect jobs in the football pools
industry and that 'there can be legitimate principled reasons for objecting
to raising revenue through government-sponsored gambling.' The letter also
says local charities may be affected,
However, Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, supported the
National Lottery Campaign. 'People are going to be more enthusiastic about
buying tickets if the money is going into charitable purposes, rather than
being siphoned off by the Treasury,' he said.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers at odds on future of coal
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR chaired another cabinet committee on the future of the coal
industry yesterday with no sign that the dispute between ministers, over how
much the government should help, has been resolved.
Minsters are at odds over how many pits should be saved, the extent and
duration of any subsidy for coal - and the precedent such a subsidy may set.
Downing Street said yesterday's meeting reviewed, rather than narrowed, the
options available. Final decisions will not come for 'some time'.
The meeting came as the Commons' trade and industry committee met to debate
its report on the coal industry for which the government is waiting before
announcing firm decisions.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is facing strong
resistance from the Treasury over his proposals for possible subsidies. Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, want
subsidies to be strictly time-limited. They are understood to be backed by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary who has a coal pit in his Nottingham
Rushcliffe constituency.
A 'union bashing' mentality in the cabinet was responsible for a serious
misjudgement of the public mood over pit closures, according to former prime
minister Sir Edward Heath, David Goodhart adds.
Speaking on BBC radio, Sir Edward said: 'We've now got to be very careful
that we aren't making changes in industrial relations legislation just for
political reasons, to show that we're still bashing the unions. This
psychology, I think, was the cause of the disaster over the miners'.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs seek monarchy review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE for Labour's constitutional agenda to include the political role of
the monarchy intensified yesterday, as members of the party's constitutional
commission made it clear they wanted to ensure this was included in the
debate.
The first meeting of the committee, chaired by Mr Tony Blair, the shadow
home secretary, yesterday focused on a bill of rights. While wanting to
ensure that the question of the monarchy does not overshadow its work,
especially in the early stages, committee members said they wanted the issue
opened up.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the shadow public services minister, highlighted the
weekly audience given by the Queen to the prime minister as one aspect of
the current arrangements which should be reviewed.

THERE was no prospect of the Maastricht agreement leading the European
Community towards replacing a sense of national identity with a sense of
belonging to a greater European ideal, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign
office minister, told MPs yesterday.
As the Commons debated the specific competence of the Community in European
culture at the beginning of the sixth day of the detailed committee
discussion of the bill to approve the treaty, Mr Garel-Jones responded to
fears voiced by Euro-sceptics by insisting that such concerns were
groundless in the context of the agreement.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Hurd sees way to renew China talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAY can be found to reopen stalled talks between Britain and China over
disputed proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, for
democratic reforms in Hong Kong, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Hurd, who was speaking after a meeting in London between a delegation of
conservative members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco), Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and himself, did not give details of the
conditions for a resumption of Sino-British discussions.
'The prime minister said that we entirely accepted that it was desirable to
talk these things through with China. He said that we believed - without
being specific about tactics - that a way for that can be found,' Mr Hurd
said.
But 'it was a little too soon' for either side to decide whether a meeting
in Beijing between himself and Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister,
should take place as scheduled.
The UK foreign secretary left open the possibility that the Patten proposals
might be amended when they are submitted to Legco at the end of next month.
But he declined to comment on a suggestion by the conservative Legco members
that Mr Patten should take the initiative in revising his proposals before
they were debated in Legco, as a way of improving relations with China.
Mr Allen Lee, the leader of the so-called Hong Kong Co-operative Resources
Centre delegation, said it had expressed concern at the current impasse.
'We called on him (Mr Major) to amend the package as a gesture of good
will,' Mr Lee said. 'We also wanted to impress on him the urgency of
resuming the dialogue with China.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kenyan government, in a sharp policy reversal, yesterday asked the
United Nations to send home immediately all 500,000 refugees in the country,
Reuter reports from Nairobi.
The government said banditry and the strain on the country's resources had
prompted the move, which was announced on state radio. It followed a spate
of bandit attacks along Kenya's border with Somalia in which at least 18
people, eight of them policemen have been killed.
'The number of refugees in Kenya from Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan have not
only seriously compromised the security of this country but greatly
outstretched the infrastructure and medical services,' the government said.
The statement was made by Mr William Kimalat, a permanent secretary in the
office of President Daniel arap Moi, and was the president's first big
policy change since winning disputed general elections last month.
President Moi said last year that Kenya would do what it could for refugees
from its less fortunate neighbours but has complained of the cost because
western states suspended aid worth Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m) monthly to his
country in 1991.
The balance of payments support was withheld to force Mr Moi to hold
multi-party polls and overhaul the economy and there is little sign it will
be reinstated because of Kenya's failure to achieve key economic targets,
diplomats said.
There was no immediate comment on the move from the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees' office in Nairobi or the diplomatic community. The announcement
coincided with a UN announcement from Geneva that it was starting an
emergency airlift of food to some 300,000 Somali refugees in camps in
northern Kenya.
Earlier, the Kenyan government freed its last four political prisoners in a
goodwill gesture towards domestic and foreign critics. Among those freed was
Kenya's most prominent dissident, Koigi wa Wamwere, who faced the death
penalty for charges of plotting to overthrow President Moi.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli parliament last night voted to scrap a controversial ban on
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, removing what many
supporters of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led government regarded as an
obstacle to Middle East peace negotiations.
The Knesset passed by 39 votes to 20 a bill to annul a provision enacted in
1986 which made illegal any meetings between Israeli citizens and members of
the PLO, which is designated an illegal terrorist organisation under Israeli
law. Mr Abie Nathan, a prominent Israeli peace campaigner, was twice jailed
under the ban for meeting Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman.
However, Mr Rabin, who was not present for the vote, only reluctantly backed
last night's move. There have been calls from within his centre-left
coalition for Israel to take a further step and open direct talks with the
PLO, particularly since the government threw the future of peace
negotiations into doubt by expelling 415 alleged Palestinian Islamic
militants to Lebanon last month.
The prime minister has said he continues to oppose allowing the Tunis-based
PLO an official role in negotiations.
A special UN envoy arrived in Israel yesterday in his second attempt to win
Israeli concessions on the Palest-inians deported to southern Lebanon.

<TEXT>
THAILAND, facing a sharp fall in inward foreign investment, yesterday
announced plans to attract new investors and ease congestion in Bangkok by
refining tax incentives and putting more emphasis on development in the
provinces.
Approaches by foreign investors to the Board of Investment (BoI) fell for
the third year in a row in 1992, with the value of foreign capital
registered in new applications dropping to Bt12bn (Pounds 304m) from nearly
Bt25bn in 1991. The total value of proposed investments in domestic and
foreign applications fell by a quarter to Bt213bn.
Although actual investment in 1992 remained high - reflecting earlier
applications - Thai officials are anxious to ensure a steady inflow of
foreign money to finance the next stage of the country's industrial
development.
BoI officials are proposing a number of changes to Thailand's incentive
scheme for investors, including benefits for companies which move factories
away from Bangkok and increased incentives for investments in the provinces
furthest from the capital.
The plan, according to Mr Staporn, is to put the emphasis on location rather
than export promotion when it comes to granting BoI privileges to potential
investors.
The BoI board chaired by Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, will consider
the proposals later this month.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Japan's bank system unsettled by bad loans: Rescue operation
under way

A BUILD-UP of up to Y5,800bn (Pounds 30.68bn) in bad loans at loosely
regulated non-banks could pose a serious threat to the Japanese financial
system, according to a report by the research arm of Nippon Life Insurance,
the country's largest insurer.
Many of the non-banks are affiliated to commercial banks and large
industrial groups. Non-banks are regulated by local government officials
rather than the ministry of finance.
They lend but do not take in deposits from savers and are usually financed
by loans from larger financial institutions, mainly banks.
The report by the NLI Research Institute says an extensive rescue operation
is under way to prevent any large non-bank from going bankrupt.
The non-banks have loans worth Y98,000bn outstanding, about 40 per cent of
them to the real estate industry which has been badly hit by the fall in
land prices over the last two years.
Non-banks had loans worth about Y3,000bn to corporate clients which went
bankrupt between autumn 1991 and December last year, the report says.
In addition they had loans worth about Y2,000bn to clients which NLI
classified as having borrowed excessively.
The report says that at least 50 non-banks are being supported by their
larger financial affiliates, which have reduced the interest rates they are
charging on loans to non-banks.
These include 25 non-banks which are affiliated to commercial banks and
seven housing loan companies.
Of the 50 non-banks which NLI identifies as receiving financial support,
about 33 have been given interest rate exemptions and reductions on
borrowings worth about Y6,600bn.
The report puts the annual value of these interest rate reductions and
exemptions at Y2,590bn.
The report estimates that 34 of these financially troubled non-banks have
bad loans, mainly to property companies, which are worth Y5,800bn.
According to finance ministry figures the top commercial banks had bad loans
worth about Y12,300bn at the end of September.
However this is widely believed to be an underestimate of the extent of bad
loans in the financial system, as it does not include bad loans at regional
banks and among non-banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S parliament yesterday approved constitutional amendments to strip
the country's nine hereditary rulers of their immunity from the law, Reuter
reports from Kuala Lumpur.
At a special sitting, 133 members voted in favour of the bill, with 16
abstentions. No one opposed the bill, proposed by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Monday.
This may provoke a constitutional crisis, as the sultans can delay, but not
block, legislation for 30 days. But the constitution also says no amendments
can be made on matters affecting the rulers' position without their consent.
The sultans, who take turns to be king for five years under Malaysia's
constitutional monarchy, had rejected the proposals on Monday.
The amendments divest the nine sultans of their legal immunity and their
power to pardon family members of criminal charges.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Iraq holds out olive branches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE offer by Iraq of a ceasefire with the US-led forces, due to come into
effect this morning, came yesterday amid other signs that Baghdad was
attempting to reopen a dialogue with the west.
Earlier yesterday the Vatican said it had agreed to an Iraqi request to ask
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, to promote talks between
Baghdad and the allies aimed at ending the current crisis. Wissam Chawkat
al-Zahawi, Iraq's ambassador to the Vatican, conveyed the request yesterday
in talks with Archbishop Jean-Louie Tauran, the Holy See's foreign
'minister'.
Last night there was further evidence that Iraq might be intent on improving
relations with the Gulf war allies when Mr Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi
ambassador to the United Nations, said his country would allow UN weapons
inspectors to fly directly from Bahrain, their regional headquarters, to
Baghdad.
The UN accepted the offer, which was made without conditions and which
guaranteed the safety of UN aircraft.
The offer removed a principal cause of dispute between the UN and Baghdad
and Mr Ralph Ekeus, head of the UN Commission set up to identify and
eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said that flights would be
resumed as soon as it was feasible.
Baghdad says this week it has also stopped all raids across the border into
Kuwait and police posts have been removed from inside Kuwaiti territory,
both causes of friction with the UN.
What seemed to be another olive branch was offered to President-elect Bill
Clinton by President Saddam Hussein's press secretary, Mr Abdul Jabbar
Muhsen, in an open letter published in yesterday's al-Thawra newspaper. 'Mr
President, the people did not elect you to (continue) with these policies. .
. be with change, with a real new world as you promised. . . hostility
towards Iraq will deny you the realities on which the legitimate interests
of your country stand,' it said.
But Baghdad did not immediately renounce its rejection of the no-fly zones
north of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd parallel as illegal, and
has been arguing that Washington had no backing from the UN Security Council
for its recent attacks, which the Iraqis say have killed at least 45 people.
A Revolutionary Command Council statement offering the mutual ceasefire said
merely that 'this gives the new administration in the US time to study the
no-fly zones in the north and south' and time 'to establish a constructive
dialogue'.
Iraq has been hit four times in less than a week by allied air attacks to
enforce the no-fly zones and UN Security Council resolution 688, despite the
fact that, unlike UN resolutions on Kuwait, resolution 688 contains no
provision authorising states to enforce compliance. The Iraqi regime, ahead
of the statement last night, had said it would continue to resist what it
sees as an infringement of sovereignty.
Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, had said on Monday that the no-fly
zones was part of a hidden agenda by some western nations.

FT  20 JAN 93 / New machinery orders fall 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE corporate investment in new plant and equipment is still depressed
according to official figures published yesterday. They show that orders for
new machinery in November were 16 per cent down on the year before.
The Economic Planning Agency, which released the figures, said it was the
eighth consecutive year-on-year fall in orders from manufacturing industry,
excluding the shipbuilding and electric power industries.
The value of orders in November was Y919.2bn, (Pounds 4.9bn), about 15 per
cent up on the previous month largely because of a surge in orders from the
coal and oil industries which distorted the figures.
Mr Yoshior Hayashi, the finance minister said he was not yet considering
plans to front load public works spending into the first half of the 1993
fiscal year as the Japanese parliament has not yet approved the budget for
1993.
However, it is widely expected that once the budget is approved the ministry
will bring forward public spending plans, as it did last year, to help
maintain the momentum of spending on public works.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Thailand plans tax incentives to attract investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND, facing a sharp fall in inward foreign investment, yesterday
announced plans to attract new investors and ease congestion in Bangkok by
refining tax incentives and putting more emphasis on development in the
provinces.
Approaches by foreign investors to the Board of Investment (BoI) fell for
the third year in a row in 1992, with the value of foreign capital
registered in new applications dropping to Bt12bn (Pounds 304m) from nearly
Bt25bn in 1991. The total value of proposed investments in domestic and
foreign applications fell by a quarter to Bt213bn.
Although actual investment in 1992 remained high - reflecting earlier
applications - Thai officials are anxious to ensure a steady inflow of
foreign money to finance the next stage of the country's industrial
development.
Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BoI secretary general, told a meeting of the European
chambers of commerce in Bangkok yesterday that the decline in foreign direct
investment was due to a combination of 'political instability in Thailand,
the opening-up of new cheap labour sites in the region, the well-known
infrastructure and manpower constraints of our nation, and the recession in
world markets'.
BoI officials are proposing a number of changes to Thailand's incentive
scheme for investors, including benefits for companies which move factories
away from Bangkok and increased incentives for investments in the provinces
furthest from the capital.
The plan, according to Mr Staporn, is to put the emphasis on location rather
than export promotion when it comes to granting BoI privileges to potential
investors.
The BoI board, chaired by Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, who has
pledged to support regional development, will consider the proposals later
this month.
Despite the downturn in applications, Mr Staporn said he was comforted by
the knowledge that investment would be sustained by a series of large
infrastructure projects and by the increasing number of new projects in
areas that would deepen Thailand's industrial base.
Taiwanese investment in Thailand has fallen sharply, as it has in Malaysia,
but this reflects the fact that Taiwanese businesses are locating
'screwdriver' assembly operations and textile factories in countries with
cheaper labour costs, such as Vietnam.
Meanwhile, Japanese and European companies are using Thailand for
investments in more sophisticated sectors such as chemicals and automotive
components.

SOUTH Korean tax authorities said they were investigating the subsidiaries

reports from Seoul. A National Tax Administration (NTA) official said the
South Korean operations of Swedish packaging specialists Tetrapak, US
computer component maker Applied Magnetics and US tobacco giants Philip
Morris and RJ Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, were under
investigation.
The official said the NTA suspected Hankook Tetrapak, Applied Magnetics
Korea , RJ Reynolds Korea and Philip Morris Korea of underpaying corporate
taxes between calendar 1989 and 1991. He said AMK and Hankook Tetra were
suspected of underpricing manufacturing costs in order to transfer sales
revenues to their parent companies, while the cigarette companies are
thought to have set excessive import prices.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Lee urges Singaporeans to spread their wings: The island
state is urged to recapture the entrepreneurial spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is the most comfortable country in
Asia. But Singapore's former prime minister is not boasting - he is worried.
'That's our problem,' says Mr Lee. 'Too comfortable, no one wants to go
abroad . . . we have got to shake Singaporeans up, make them adventurous, or
we will be losers.' Having outgrown its small domestic base Singapore has no
alternative but to invest more overseas, says Mr Lee.
When Mr Lee, now a senior minister, talks, Singapore listens. Singaporeans
are busy discovering a world outside their island republic. A day hardly
goes by without an announcement of another overseas investment project.
'China fever' has gripped boardrooms. Mr Zhu Zhen-yuan of the Chinese
embassy in Singapore says Singapore's investments in China in the first six
months of 1992 totalled Dollars 494m (Pounds 325m) against a total of
Dollars 896m for the entire 1979-91 period. 'I believe Singapore's total
investment commitment in 1992 will exceed the total commitment of the past
13 years,' says Mr Zhu.
Singapore's businessmen are busy in Vietnam. The island state is Vietnam's
leading trading partner with total two-way trade of more than Dollars 530m
in the first six months of 1992.
Both Vietnam and China are tapping Singapore's expertise in infrastructure
development. Several million Singapore dollars have been invested in hotel,
shipyard and telecommunications projects in Vietnam. Singapore's large state
companies, which still have a big influence on the domestic economy, are
linking up with the private sector as part of a 'Singapore Inc' approach to
winning China projects.
The Shanghai authorities are discussing a SDollars 430m (Pounds 168m)
airport project and the formation of a special economic zone with the
Singaporeans.
But it is Fujian province, further to the south, that is attracting most
interest from Singapore. Fujian is the home of the Hokkien chinese dialect
group, the dominant group in Singapore.
Mr Oei Hong Leong, a Singapore businessman with strong links to the Chinese
community in Indonesia, has taken control of more than 60 former state-owned
enterprises in Fujian. Late last year two of Singapore's biggest state
companies, Singapore Technologies and Jurong Environmental Engineering,
entered into a partnership with Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the Chinese-Indonesian
tycoon, to develop a 5,000 hectare industrial park in Fujian. The estimated
cost of the first phase of the project is SDollars 300m.
The same Singapore-Liem partnership has already successfully developed an
industrial park on Batam, an Indonesian island about 20km south of
Singapore.
To encourage greater investment overseas, the government is providing low
interest loans for various projects. Singapore's Trade Development Board has
promised to help businessmen identify overseas investment opportunities.
Singaporean schools are being set up abroad to encourage families to go
overseas.
This more outward looking, aggressive approach to business is slowly being
adopted by Singapore's cash rich banks. Traditionally viewed as conservative
stay-at-home institutions, Singapore's four main banks - Overseas-Chinese,
DBS, United Overseas Bank and Overseas Union Bank - are now big lenders in
the region and are pushing for more international loan syndication business.
Singapore's banks have now surpassed Hong Kong as Thailand's main lender.
While Hong Kong still has the lion's share of China loan business, Singapore
banks are starting to edge into that market. Total offshore borrowings
arranged by Singapore banks rose by 30 per cent in the first half of 1992 to
more than Dollars 4bn.
Singapore's 2.8m people are sitting on a mountain of savings. Savings now
stand at 47 per cent of GDP. The country's foreign exchange reserves are
officially reported to be nearly Dollars 40bn but are generally believed to
be much higher.
While investments have been made in manufacturing enterprises in Malaysia
and to a lesser extent in Indonesia, the main part of Singapore's reserves
have in the past been invested in stocks, shares, bonds and real estate -
the latter principally in Australia. Other investments - by state companies
in technology ventures in Silicon Valley - have not been so successful.
According to Mr Lee the thrust of Singapore investment policy must change.
Singapore must become more like South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong which have
internationalised and made far flung investments in manufacturing and other
projects.
But Singapore has a lot of catching up to do. Hong Kong entrepreneurs have
been investing heavily in China for years. The Taiwanese, despite
restrictions on doing business with China, have been quietly investing
millions of dollars. The South Koreans are working on projects all over the
world, some under very tough conditions.
Investors in Batam, almost within sight of Singapore, say it is very
difficult to coax Singapore managers to the island. 'Even when we get them
here, they want to rush back at the slightest opportunity,' says an
electronics plant manager.
Mr Lee says Singaporeans have no choice but to become more outward looking -
more willing to take risks, not so afraid of failure.
The irony, say many Singaporeans, is that Mr Lee himself is largely to blame
for fostering attitudes he now criticises. Mr Lee's critics argue that by
building up an over-regulated, carefully controlled society, with an economy
dominated by state companies, the entrepreneur has been squeezed out of the
Singaporean.
'For years he (Lee) told us how wonderful Singapore was and how dangerous
and terrible everywhere else was in comparison,' says a Singapore trader.
'He bred a sort of xenophobia. He can't expect people who have grown up with
those ideas to suddenly be packing their bags and wandering off to the
outposts of China or Mongolia.'

THE West Africa division of Texaco said yesterday that about 79,500 barrels
a day (b/d) of Angola crude production has been shut down because of
fighting between Angolan troops and rebels has forced the closure of an oil
loading terminal at Soyo, AP-DJ reports from New York.
Soyo terminal operator Fina Angola shut down the field early on Monday and
asked Texaco to halt the 55,000 b/d output from its offshore field and a
24,500 b/d onshore field, a spokesman said by telephone from Florida.
Unita rebels began fighting on Monday to capture oil-rich areas in the north
and retake their headquarters in central Angola.
Soyo is the base area for five foreign-owned petroleum companies, staffed by
Angolan nationals and some 500 foreign workers from Portugal and other
European countries, according to the Portuguese news agency LUSA.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Gulf states uneasy over attacks: US deploys battery of
Patriot missiles in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US deployed Patriot missiles in Kuwait yesterday as the Kuwaiti foreign
minister sought to underline that his country's quarrel lay not with the
Iraqi people but with President Saddam Hussein's non-compliance with United
Nations resolutions. The remarks appeared to be designed to address creeping
unease among Gulf states over the latest allied raids on Iraq.
Sheikh Salem al-Sabah al-Salem said his government would 'not feel happy' if
the allies deemed it necessary to launch further attacks on Iraq, adding:
'Who is hurt? Not Saddam Hussein. It is the people who are hurt.'
Sheikh Salem's comments follow expressions of disquiet from other Arab
leaders, put most vocally by King Hussein of Jordan, over the wisdom of
persuading Iraq to comply with the UN essentially through military means.
There have also been some murmurings within Kuwait, mostly among Islamic
groups, that the country's unalloyed support for the allied raids may
isolate Kuwait within the Arab world.
Signs of unease over the latest raids have also begun to surface within the
Gulf itself, where staunchly anti-Saddam sentiment has lately been tempered
both by fears over the strategic consequences of a possible dismemberment of
Iraq and by concern over the plight of the Iraqi people.
Gulf newspapers have increasingly pointed up the apparent 'double standards'
applied by the west in its application of UN resolutions in Iraq and, in
particular, in Israel.
A statement from Saudi Arabia, where more than 90 allied aircraft are based,
called this week for 'the need to implement all security council resolutions
in general, whether on the situation in the Gulf, the Palestinian cause and
the issue of the deportees.
Sheikh Salem said yesterday the missiles were expected to be fully
operational today.
Their arrival will, in the view of military analysts, do more for Kuwait's
psychological well-being than its actual defence. Iraq may still possess
serviceable Scud missiles but western officials believe it would only be
capable of launching isolated attacks.
Nevertheless, Kuwaiti officials yesterday repeated their desire to bolster
their defences, already augmented by the arrival last week of a US brigade,
with reinforcements from Britain, France and other allies.
Kuwait's national assembly yesterday approved a law designed to increase the
monitoring of the Gulf state's overseas investments and to toughen
punishment for individuals accused of misusing public funds.

<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, yesterday urged the incoming US
administration to join the Community in pressing for a rapid end to the
Uruguay Round world trade talks, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. 'Every
week we don't have an agreement costs the world dear in money and jobs,' Sir
Leon said, in his first public statement since taking over the European
Commission trade portfolio.
He wanted to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the incoming US trade representative, as
soon as possible to discuss strategy for concluding the talks. 'We have not
reached agreement, but we have not wasted our time. We have injected new
urgency into the process and have prepared the ground for a successful
conclusion.'
He hoped a deal could be submitted to the US Congress before the
administration's current negotiating authority expired on March 2. But this
authority could be extended and Sir Leon was careful yesterday not to set
himself a specific deadline.
'An ambitious and constructive market-opening package, combined with
sticking closely to the Dunkel text (draft conclusions prepared by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, Gatt director-general), seems to me to provide the basis for a
successful negotiation.'
Sir Leon made clear that last year's controversial US-EC deal on
agricultural subsidies could not possibly be reopened before provisional
agreement had been reached with other Gatt members on the rest of the
package.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: End Gatt talks, says Dunkel

UNLESS the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks is concluded quickly it
could founder, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, warned yesterday. He
told the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), which oversees the 112-nation
round, that the talks were 'poised for conclusion'. 'We are critically short
of time. We must conclude now or risk drifting into the sands.'
The meeting was called to review progress in the six-year-old talks on the
eve of President Clinton's inauguration today. It follows two weeks'
intensive US-EC tariff negotiations which failed to produce breakthroughs.
In an appeal to the new administration to conclude a Uruguay Round deal
before the negotiating mandate granted by Congress expires in March, Mr
Dunkel said it 'can, and must be, concluded quickly'. He saw 'growing fears
that a long delay would cause a dangerous loss of momentum' where even the
existing trading system could be put at risk. Frustration was growing that
the biggest traders had not provided end-game leadership.
Since December, the Round has focused on tariff cuts, initial commitments to
liberalise services and possible changes to the draft package of rules known
as the 'final act', drawn up by Mr Dunkel in December 1991. He said
yesterday that most nations were willing to live with the draft final act in
its present form 'in the interest of a quick conclusion', repeating that
changes to the draft could only be by consensus.
The strongest objections to the draft final act have come from Japan and
South Korea over proposals to open their rice markets; Canada and others
which would have to scrap farm supply management systems; India over the
textiles accord; and the US over issues including creation of a powerful
Multilateral Trade Organisation.
Mr Hugo Paemen, EC chief negotiator, said Brussels was committed to a rapid
end of the round 'within its present parameters'. This reflects fears that
if Mr Clinton needs a fresh negotiating mandate new issues will be put on
the agenda, delaying the talks further and risking agreements made in
principle.
Colombia, Costa Rica and Guatemala yesterday said they would veto any Round
accord if the EC did not change its proposed regime for Latin American
banana imports. The EC plan, applying punitive tariffs to 'dollar' bananas
above a 2m-ton annual quota, could cut imports from Latin America 30 per
cent, they said.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor voices fears on US-EC farm deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, nominee for US trade representative in the Clinton
administration, yesterday expressed 'concern' about the US-EC agreement over
farm trade, sealed by his predecessor in an effort to push the Uruguay Round
to a conclusion.
Just a few minutes into his nomination hearing before the Senate finance
committee the California lawyer swept away concerns about his inexperience
in trade matters by politely correcting one senator on the details of the
US-EC farm trade deal. 'The devil is in the details,' he said. 'I think it
has to be looked at closely.'
Less than three hours later the finance committee approved Mr Kantor's
appointment, sending it on to the Senate for a full vote. Mr Kantor said he
hoped to be at work by tomorrow morning.
That was after he threw a new thunderbolt at the EC, insisting 'the US must
respond to the new utilities directive that went into effect on January 1'.
The local content requirements and preference given to local suppliers in
government procurement was 'a serious matter'.
Mr Kantor, a longtime Clinton friend, spoke with ease across the range of
issues he would have to deal with. He declined to commit himself on many
points, including the need to extend fast-track negotiating, hinting he
might consider working for a less ambitious package of reforms than the one
long stalled in the Uruguay Round.
He defined himself as 'a realistic person,' who would not simply assume
other countries supported the concept of free trade when the facts indicated
otherwise.
Perhaps without meaning to, Mr Kantor sent a subtle message of change in US
trade policy. When it has to act, the Clinton administration will be more
concerned with the reaction of the US voters than of its trading partners.
He promised to support a renewal of the controversial Super 301 provision,
which requires the US trade representative to single out countries with
excessive trade barriers for negotiation and perhaps retaliation.
'The days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to
foreign or defence concerns are long past,' he said. However, he added: 'No
amount of negotiating, bilaterally or multilaterally, can overcome or offset
the burdens placed on US companies from misguided economic policies or
uncontrolled health care costs. Nor are trade negotiations a substitute for
educating our children or training our workers.'
A 'coherent US economic strategy' will be co-ordinated within the new
national economic policy.
As trade representative, he will be the administration spokesman on trade,
and its negotiator. 'I will be the leader in that area,' he said,
emphasising: 'I will have direct access to the president.'

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US 'lacks systematic strategy on exports'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US lacks a systematic government-wide export strategy, which leads to
poor co-ordination between export promotion agencies. The US general
accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress, has concluded this in
a new report.
The report, on the role of the US Eximbank, which supported Dollars 12.1bn
(Pounds 7.9bn) of US exports in 1991, adds that while the bank has made
'significant efforts' to improve delivery of its services, the fragmentation
of export promotion services among 10 separate agencies results in overlaps
and gaps, and 'tends to be confusing to the US business community',
especially smaller companies.
The report makes no specific recommendations, but follows hard on a GAO
report highly critical of the management of US agricultural loan guarantee
programmes, which it says are costly, and cannot prove productive.
'The US government does not have reasonable assurances in today's tight
budget environment that its export promotion funds and staff are most
effectively used to emphasise sectors, regions and programmes with the
greatest potential return,' the report says. It points to the absence of
'one-stop shops' for US exporters.
It is however, encouraged by the creation in 1990 of the Trade Promotion
Co-ordinating Committee to 'unify and streamline' export promotion efforts,
and in particular the formalisation of the TPCC by last year's Export
Enhancement Act, which calls on the government to develop government-wide
plans for federal trade promotion.
The report calls for specific efforts by Eximbank to 'ferret out where
demand for additional financing exists'. It also calls for Eximbank to
consult exporters systematically on the use by foreign competitors of tied
aid, which the US government is active in trying to discourage. The bank has
a 'war chest' of up to Dollars 150m a year to aid US exporters facing tied
aid-funded competition, but has used the full sum in just one of the past
six years.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Russia in gas pact with Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has agreed to supply Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) worth of natural gas
to Italy, in return for having equipment to modernise its own industry
serviced by companies which are part of ENI, the Italian state oil concern.
The agreement underlines Russia's need to find the means of paying for
equipment to boost gas productivity and exports. It also emphasises Italy's
desire to continue to expand reliance on gas and to look to the new
Commonwealth as a secure energy source.
Italy has been buying gas from the former Soviet Union since 1974 and these
imports now account for 40 per cent of all external gas supplies. The
break-up of the Soviet Union and the increasing inability of the Russian
authorities to fund the modernisation and maintenance of the gas industry
has been viewed with concern in Italy.
The present deal in various forms has taken almost three years to arrange
and makes use of credit lines already approved.
Under the deal, a consortium headed by ENI's Snamprogetti and Nuovo Pignone
is to provide pipes, machinery and equipment to modernise and upgrade the
gas transport facilities of Gasprom, the Russian state gas concern. Nuovo
Pignone will provide gas turbines to boost pumping stations.
In return, Gasprom will supply gas to Snamprogetti largely from the extra
quantities from more efficient pumping operations. ENI yesterday declined to
give details on the new quantities of gas to be delivered or the pricing.
Two pipelines supply the gas to Italy running from Russia through Ukraine,
Slovakia and Austria. Current supplies, at 13.7bn cu metres a year, are near
capacity, but throughput can be upgraded.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Poorest forced to play their part
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Uruguay Round of global trade talks has marked a sea-change in the role
of developing countries in the world economy.
Previous rounds have been confined mainly to the leading traders, with other
Gatt members on the sidelines. This time, 65-70 nations are taking part in
the talks, most of them from the third world.
The change reflects a fundamental shift in attitudes within developing
countries over the past decade or so.
This stems from two main factors: near-universal adoption of growth
strategies based on trade expansion and economic liberalisation, and
disappointment with the results of special trade preferences, which have
proved a poor substitute for more open markets for their goods.
Since the round was launched in 1986, 13 developing countries have joined
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including several least
developed countries (ldcs) as defined by the United Nations. Mali, which
became a member last week, exported just Dollars 230m (Pounds 151m) worth of
goods in 1991. Of Gatt's 105 members, three-quarters are developing
countries.
However, among the 112 nations entitled to take part in the Uruguay Round
about 40 rarely show up. Some very poor or very small countries do not have
permanent staff in Geneva. Others have only one or two officials who may
have to cover all the UN organisations in the city as well as Gatt. Small
exporters may also find it hard to get a hearing from the big economic
powers.
In past rounds, this did not matter much. It was possible to be a 'free
rider' on tariff cuts negotiated between others, which are automatically
generalised through Gatt's 'most-favoured-nation' rule.
Poor countries were not asked to make concessions in return for benefits, in
accordance with the Gatt principle of giving them 'special and differential
treatment'.
But recently non-participants have become uneasily aware that this time they
may be in for more than they bargained for. Uruguay Round negotiators have
not left much room for charity. Though developing countries are not required
to make concessions 'inconsistent with their level of development', most
have opted to swap concessions for bigger trade gains.
Overall, 'special and differential treatment' has been reduced to little
more than a longer grace period before developing countries have to apply
the same rules as everybody else.
Least developed countries have been given longer transitions and are
exempted from commitments to reduce farm subsidies.
It looks as if 'free-riding', too, may not be possible. The draft Uruguay
Round agreement to create a Multilateral Trade Organisation, with far wider
powers and scope than Gatt, requires all intending MTO members to produce
tariff schedules and formal offers, however exiguous, to open their services
markets. If they are to reap the round's benefits, the smallest and poorest
nations will have to contribute their tuppence-worth.

FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Sir Leon Brittan urges new US
administration to push for resolution of Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, yesterday urged the incoming
US administration to join the Community in pressing for a rapid resolution
of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, Andrew Hill reports from
Brussels.
'Every week we don't have an agreement costs the world dear in money and
jobs,' Sir Leon told journalists, in his first public statement since taking
over the European Commission trade portfolio.
Sir Leon said he wanted to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the incoming US trade
representative, as soon as possible to discuss strategy for concluding the
talks.
The US and EC originally hoped a deal could be reached before President
George Bush stepped down.
Sir Leon said yesterday: 'We have not reached agreement, but we have
certainly not wasted our time. We have injected new urgency into the process
and have prepared the ground for a quick spurt to a successful conclusion.'
Sir Leon said he still hoped a deal could be submitted to the US Congress
before the administration's current negotiating authority expired.
The official expiry date is March 2, but the authority could be extended and
Sir Leon was careful yesterday not to set himself a specific deadline.
'An ambitious and constructive market-opening package, combined with
sticking closely to the Dunkel text (draft conclusions prepared by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, Gatt director-general), seems to me to provide the basis for a
successful negotiation,' he added.
Sir Leon made clear that there was no possibility of reopening last year's
controversial deal between the EC and the US on agricultural subsidies
before provisional agreement had been reached with other members of the Gatt
on the rest of the package.
The agriculture deal is deeply unpopular in France, but Sir Leon said EC
member states would get the chance to air their 'internal disagreements'
formally once the whole package was ready for their approval.

Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, said that Moscow was currently trying to conclude a series of
free trade agreements with the other members of the CIS by February 1, after
which date it would levy export taxes, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
He added that he expected agreement to be reached at the Minsk summit on a
commonwealth bank which would then be able to act as a clearing house for
inter-republic trade.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Fear of sharing a bed with the 'Russian elephant': Concerns
about Moscow's political dominance may lead to a 'two-tier' CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States meet in the Belarus
capital of Minsk on Friday, they must agree a charter for an organisation
that has been in crisis since its inception. They will probably fail.
While economically the CIS member states are deeply intertwined and heavily
dependent on low energy prices from Russia, politically they lack the will
and administrative structures to develop co-operative institutions.
The challenge will be to reconcile the demands for a downgrading of the
commonwealth into the loosest of alliance - from states such as Ukraine -
with calls for a strengthening of the organisation and the fulfilment of its
decisions to date - from Kazakhstan and other central Asian republics.
The charter proposes a range of agreements to co-ordinate economic, foreign
and defence policies - with common control of the external borders of the
CIS and a common defence policy, both overseen by a new council of defence
ministers. Free movement of goods, capital and labour between CIS members
operating a common economic zone would be mandatory, and a governing body
located in Minsk would be empowered to impose sanctions on states which did
not observe the charter.
On Monday, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said Ukraine would
resist any attempt 'to turn (the CIS) into a supra-national body subject to
international law'. Mr Kravchuk sees the draft charter of the CIS, prepared
for the Minsk summit, as just such an attempt.
In an interview in Izvestia earlier this month, Mr Kravchuk said that 'we
must realise that we are sharing a bed with an elephant (Russia): if it
rolls over it can smother us'.
However, Mr Narsultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, intends to
demand in Minsk that the CIS be strengthened. Speaking after a meeting two
weeks ago of the five Central Asian republics in the Uzbek capital of
Tashkent, Mr Nazarbayev said that these states 'will support a common rouble
zone'.
Mr Askar Akaev, president of Kyrgyzia, said at the same meeting that 'it's
important that the CIS become a functioning organisation, and not just a
formal one'.
But not all the central Asian leaders seem to agree. Mr Saparmurad Niyazov,
president of Turkmenistan, said in an interview with the Interfax news
agency that new CIS co-ordinating bodies were 'unnecessary' and that a
rouble zone was impossible. 'How can one speak of a rouble zone when in
different villages the value of the rouble is different?'
Russia, the 'elephant' of the Commonwealth, is torn both ways. Mr Vladimir
Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, speaking last week, said that
'many experts now say that we (Russia) should move to world prices for
energy (sales to CIS) right away' - but added that, because of the
disruptive effects on Russian industry, the move would not be taken
immediately.
'A standard approach of moving to world prices should not be expected,' he
said.
The interdependence of the Commonwealth means that no change in one state is
without costs to others. Above everything else, decisions taken by Russia on
oil supplies and their price go to the very heart of the other CIS
countries' increasingly shaky economies - especially heavily industrialised
Ukraine.
Ukraine had been used to consuming some 60m tonnes of oil a year - some 86
per cent of that from Russia. Its efforts to diversify its sources of supply
have been limited in success: only one deal, with the National Iranian Oil
Company, to supply 80,000 barrels of crude a day, has been reportedly
signed, but nothing so far has been delivered. In talks with Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, last week, Mr Kravchuk received a vaguely
worded promise of 20m tonnes a year from Russia, essentially on a barter
basis: this was better than the 15m originally offered, but will mean
desperately hard times for Ukrainian oil users.
The proclaimed success of the Russian-Ukrainian talks is itself ambiguous.
Though an oil deal was done, and though a guarantee from Russia of nuclear
protection to Ukraine will - according to Mr Kravchuk - make it easier for
the Ukrainian parliamentarians to ratify the treaty with the US on strategic
arms reduction (Start), this was a bilateral deal, not one which
strengthened the CIS. As Mr Kravchuk said on Monday, the 'specific
questions' which the states must address are matters for individual
negotiation, not for general agreement.
The death of the CIS has been much mooted in the past year, as it became
clear that none of the member states were willing to make serious efforts to
render it effective and that the needs of nation-building in each state were
driving them apart rather than together. It is possible that a break may
occur in Minsk - but more likely that a 'two-tier' CIS will emerge, with an
inner and outer core. In the inner core would be Russia, Armenia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia and Uzbekistan; and in the outer core, Ukraine,
Turkemistan and Moldova (though this state has never ratified the CIS
agreement).
Azerbaijan, formerly a member of the CIS, has effectively left it, and
Tadjikistan, also a member, is presently in the grip of civil war and it is
unclear what position it will take when stable government is restored.
Georgia, where civil war also rages, has never participated in the CIS,
though it may decide to join the 'outer core': while the three Baltic states
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would be unlikely to join even that.
Yet even this is unlikely to be stable - so pressured are all of these
states and so drawn to make ever-closer relationships with states outside of
the old USSR on their external borders. The long dissolution seems set to
continue.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Kohl cabinet changes fail to impress

<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday announced the promotion of four new
ministers to his cabinet, and axed the jobs of seven junior ministers, in a
reshuffle intended to revitalise his ailing coalition.
Immediate reaction to the long-awaited and accurately predicted shake-up was
sceptical, with political observers saying the new faces in the government
were scarcely likely to make a big electoral impact.
The most important job in the reshuffle was that of economics minister,
following the surprise New Year resignation of Mr Jurgen Mollemann. The only
involuntary move was the replacement of Mr Heinz Riesenhuber, the research
and technology minister since the start of the Kohl administration in 1982.
However the man with potentially the most challenging portfolio will be Mr
Wolfgang Botsch, who replaces Mr Christian Schwarz-Schilling as minister for
post and telecommunications, with the task of overseeing the reform and
eventual privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
The fourth job in the reshuffle, that of agriculture minister, sees the
retirement of Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the bluff Bavarian who has been one of the
most cheerful and staunch defenders of the Common Agricultural Policy in
Brussels since 1983.
He is being replaced by Mr Jochen Borchert, a Christian Democrat (CDU) from
North Rhine-Westphalia, who is himself a farmer and trained agricultural
engineer.
The new economics minister is, as expected, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the nominee
of the minority Free Democrats (FDP) in the coalition, who is currently the
director of the Treuhand privatisation agency in Berlin responsible for the
textile industry.
He was formerly the Berlin city senator responsible for finance, and in
1990-1991 the chairman of Citibank's German subsidiary in Frankfurt.
Mr Riesenhuber's replacement is 43-year-old Mr Matthias Wissman, currently
economics spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag, and from
1973 to 1983 chairman of the youth wing of the party.
The oldest in the group is Mr Botsch, who has hitherto been leader of the
Christian Social Union group in the Bundestag, the Bavarian sister-party of
the CDU.
He is seen as a close ally of Mr Theo Waigel, the party leader and finance
minister.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Brussels seeks G7 policy meeting: EC's Christophersen urges
closer monetary co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission is seeking a special meeting of Group of Seven
finance ministers to bolster monetary co-operation and co-ordination between
the EC and the incoming Clinton administration in the US.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said yesterday that
lack of monetary co-operation with the US was partly to blame for last
September's crisis in the European Monetary System and the resulting
turbulence in international currency markets.
It is understood that contacts between Brussels and Washington have taken
place with a view to holding a meeting of G7 finance ministers in early
February - well ahead of their scheduled talks in April, around the time of
the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee.
In Senate confirmation hearings last week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
secretary-designate, showed interest in breathing new life into G7
co-operation.
Mr Christophersen - who as an EC Commissioner would not normally attend a G7
finance ministers meeting - said yesterday it was 'very important' to revive
international monetary co-operation inside the G7 which, as a forum, had
fallen into disrepair. 'In the last nine to 10 months, there has been a wide
gap between US and European interest rates. That is part of the explanation
of what has happened in the currency markets,' he said.
Mr Christophersen believed European interest rates had now 'peaked' -
picking up the optimistic theme struck last Monday at a meeting of EC
finance ministers in Brussels. He predicted that Germany would soon be able
to lower interest rates, based on the prospect of a wages pact between
unions, employers and the Bonn government and tax increases to fund the
costs of German unification.
These were the preconditions set by the Bundesbank for an early cut in
interest rates, said Mr Christophersen who this week unveiled a lower
forecast of 0.8 per cent growth in the Community in 1993 - down from between
1 and 1.5 per cent. The Danish commissioner suggested yesterday, however,
that a small fiscal stimulus in the US could lead to an extra 0.5 per cent
growth in the EC this year.
On prospects for Emu, Mr Christophersen said it was likely that the planned
enlargement of the EC to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway by 1995
would increase the chances of a 'majority' of EC members opting for a common
currency.
Under the provisions of the Maastricht treaty, the European Commission must
prepare a report on whether member states' are in compliance with strict
convergence programmes on budget deficits, inflation and exchange rate
stability. Mr Christophersen predicted that the new Scandinavian members and
Austria would probably meet the criteria and would want to press ahead with
the third stage of Emu by 1997.
But he stressed the importance of closer co-operation between EC members
both on measures to promote growt - such as shifting from current to capital
spending - and to achieve the strict economic convergence targets.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Debate on Bosnian peace plan adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PALE, BOSNIA,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian Serb parliament last night adjourned a crucial debate on the
Geneva peace plan as a midnight deadline passed for acceptance of the
constitutional proposals for a new Bosnian state.
The debate, which is to resume this morning, took place as international
mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen prepared to fly to Zagreb and
Sarajevo today.
The Bosnian Serb assembly, meeting in Pale, was to debate the proposed
framework, under which Bosnia would remain a unitary state, but would be
divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, last week accepted the plan,
on condition that it was approved by his assembly, and after he had been
subjected to strong pressure by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president.
During a pause in last night's debate Mr Karadzic expressed confidence that
the measures would be approved. However the 7 1/2 -hour session included
many speeches from opponents.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for Lord Owen and Mr Vance, said they had
been invited by President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia in an attempt to bring
an end to the flare-up of fighting between Moslems and Croats, nominally
allies in the conflict with the Serbs.
The two men will have talks with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and
Bosnian Croat leader Mr Mate Boban in Zagreb, after meeting Mr Izetbegovic
but will not go to Pale.
It is clear that the Bosnian Serbs interpret the peace proposals differently
from their authors, who see them as a guarantee against the creation of an
independent Serb state within Bosnia, which would have the freedom to decide
on a union with Serbia proper.
In Pale, Serb officials, in an attempt to justify their expected approval of
the constitutional framework, said they viewed it as similar to the UN peace
plan for Croatia: a means to consolidate their territorial gains in Bosnia.
Far from restoring Bosnia-Hercegovina's territorial integrity, the officials
said the plan opened the way to a de facto recognition of a Bosnian Serb
republic.
AP adds: 'The atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Moslems pale in
comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and
other abuses committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian
Moslems,' the US State Department said yesterday in its annual human rights
report to Congress.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIRTUALLY every part of the German population will be hit by the package of
spending cuts, future tax increases and immediate abolition of tax
allowances proposed yesterday by the ruling German coalition. The package
represents the government's response to the soaring cost of German
unification. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, maintains that it is
intended to be socially fair, with 70 per cent of the cost falling on the
top 50 per cent of income earners.
Key elements include:
reintroduction of the 'solidarity surcharge' on income and corporation tax
from 1995;
road tax and petrol tax increase from 1994 (to pay for rail reform and
debt);
extension of 30 per cent tax on investment income to include interest
payments from foreign investment funds;
halving the tax allowance on mortgages for purchase of existing dwellings
(no change for new buildings);
increased tax on insurance policies (excluding fire and life insurance) to
12 per cent in July, 1993 and 15 per cent in January, 1995;
central government payroll to be reduced by 1 per cent per annum in 1994 and
1995;
there will be a reduction in unemployment benefits by 1 per cent for
families, and 3 per cent for childless workers;
further cuts in defence spending of DM300m (Pounds 123.4m) in 1993, and
DM700m per year from 1994-96;
progressive reduction in income support to farmers, from 2.5 per cent in
1993 to zero by 1996;
reduction in subsidies to coke and coal industries of DM855m by 1996;
cuts in shipbuilding subsidies by DM160m 1993-95;
means tests for childrens' allowances and education grants for infants;
reduction in social assistance for asylum seekers by DM2bn per year;
there will be a postponement of enforcing higher environmental and social
standards for local services, such as sewage treatment and swimming pools.

THE European Commission has decided to open an in-depth investigation into
the proposed merger between the Netherlands' three biggest paper and
packaging companies, focusing specifically on their dominance of the Benelux
print press market, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The merger of
KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG would create Europe's second-largest paper
and packaging group, after Stora of Sweden.
Two of the prospective partners are agents for two rival German producers of
printing presses - Buhrmann for Heidelberg, and VRG for MAN-Roland.
Together, they account for between 60 and 70 per cent of the Benelux market.

DETAILS of an agreement dividing the foreign debts and assets of the former

write Chrystia Freeland from Kiev and Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
According to the deal, signed in Moscow on Saturday, Russia and Ukraine have
agreed to divide up the former Soviet Union's assets and debts and make
separate arrangements for servicing their respective shares of the debt.
However, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister responsible
for the debt negotiations, said any agreement would have to be acceptable to
the ex-Soviet Union's creditors and until now they had been unhappy about
separate repayments.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday issued its gloomiest 1993 economic forecast
to date as the Bundesbank shrugged off warnings of lasting recession, either
at home or abroad.
International growth this year would be modest, especially in the G7
countries, but there was no threat of collapse, according to Mr Otmar
Issing, who is a leading member of the central bank's directorate.
Recovery in the US was already showing signs of robustness, he said in an
interview.
However, the German Economics Ministry warned at the same time that 'a
painful, long-lasting recession' in Germany could be avoided only if pay and
public spending were controlled sufficiently to allow the central bank to
cut interest rates.
Downgrading its forecasts, the ministry said gross domestic product in the
west would shrink this year by around 1 per cent, after growing overall by a
real 1.5 per cent in 1992.
Mr Issing acknowledged the domestic economy's fading fortunes, but said
short-term growth prospects were not decisive.
'What matters is whether, after weak first and second quarters, we move into
an upswing in conditions which make recovery sustainable. We do not need a
short burst of activity but stable and lasting growth,' he added.
Mr Issing's comments underlined Bundesbank hardliners' determination to
maintain tight control over monetary policy despite some indications of
wavering among other central council members.
It is understood that regional members, worried by the domestic economic
situation and unemployment in particular, failed by only the narrowest
voting margin to force cuts in key Lombard and discount rates at the
council's last meeting on January 7.
'We view the threatening increase in unemployment with great concern,' Mr
Issing said.
'On the other hand the Bundesbank is guided primarily by monetary
developments.'
Anyone who said inflation was no longer a problem had found acceptable rates
of price increases which did not tally with the Bundesbank's legal
obligations to maintain stability, he said.
Mr Issing's remarks on recession also appeared to be intended to help
counter the slump in business and popular confidence within Germany and
pre-empt possible interest rate speculation before Thursday's meeting of the
bank council.
There was little reason to fear self-perpetuating recession in Germany, Mr
Issing claimed.
The country had successfully avoided the danger of asset inflation through
'excessive developments' in the construction sector.
'This means there are no grounds for concern that Germany will take a
relatively long time (as in other G7 countries) to find the basis for an
upswing,' he added.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Poland tries to force debt deal: Warsaw stops servicing loan
from martial law era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is unilaterally announcing its intention to cut debt service payments
on a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 720m) loan originally extended as a revolving
trade facility in 1983.
The decision follows the appointment of Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the country's
economic counsellor in the US, as chief debt negotiator for forthcoming
talks with the London Club of commercial banks on Dollars 13.3bn of loans
which Poland stopped servicing in the autumn of 1989.
Unlike the bulk of Poland's frozen commercial debt, Warsaw has continued
until now to service the Dollars 1.1bn loan which was extended after all
other sources of credit dried up following the imposition of martial law in
1981. Warsaw's willingness to treat the revolving credit as a special case
made it a favourite on the secondary market where it traded at a 20 per cent
premium to ordinary blocked Polish debt.
It has now lost this special status. The Polish side argues that the 80 per
cent cut in payments from February 4 places all its London Club creditors on
the same basis. Banks involved in the debt negotiations yesterday criticised
the unilateral move while welcoming the appointment of a new debt negotiator
after a two-year hiatus since the dismissal of Mr Janusz Sawicki in August
1991. An official statement said Poland was seeking an agreement with the
commercial banks 'which is within the country's economic possibilities' and
is 'comparable with Poland's other payments agreements'. This refers to
Poland's search for an agreement similar to a 1991 deal with western
government creditors in the Paris Club.
This agreed a 50 per cent cut in the value of outstanding debt by 1994,
provided Poland obtained International Monetary Fund approval for its
financial and budgetary policies in this period.
Poland's overall debt stood at Dollars 49.4bn at the end of last year, of
which Dollars 31.7bn is owed to western governments. This year's budget sets
aside Dollars 940m for debt service payments .

FT  20 JAN 93 / Three EC states cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were new signs yesterday of an easing in European monetary policy
after three central banks announced cuts in their main money market interest
rates.
In a concerted move, both the Belgian and Dutch central banks lowered their
main dealing rates by 10 basis points. The Netherlands cut its special
advances rate to 8.4 per cent, while the Belgian National Bank reduced its
central rate to the same level.
The Dutch authorities said they were able to cut their dealing rates because
of the continuing strength of the guilder inside the European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM).
Denmark's central bank also lowered by one percentage point - to 12 per cent
 -the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks for two weeks. The
move had little impact on the Danish krone, which has been under pressure
inside the ERM in recent weeks.
In the immediate aftermath of the rate move, the krone rose fractionally
against the D-Mark from DKr3.8530 to DKr3.8500.
The decision to mark down interest rates was seen as another indication that
tensions inside the exchange rate mechanism are easing following the intense
currency speculation of recent weeks.
However, the cuts in interest rates failed to have much impact on money
market rates in other European countries. The rate for 3-month French francs
moved higher yesterday from around 11 1/4 per cent to around 11 1/2 per
cent, as the franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark.
The Bundesbank yesterday raised speculation that it could shave short-term
money market rates again by announcing that it would revert to its usual
practice of tendering for variable rate securities repurchase funds in
today's weekly intervention in the German money market.
The move means commercial banks can bid below the level of 8.6 per cent set
by the Bundesbank last week as the cost of borrowing short-term funds.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, also helped sentiment by
saying that the German central bank would use all its scope to cut interest
rates where this was justified.
The Bundesbank meets tomorrow for its fortnightly council meeting.

More than two French people out of every three - 72 per cent - are against
any devaluation of the franc, according to an opinion poll commissioned and
published yesterday by France's Finance Ministry, writes David Buchan in
Paris.
'This shows the policy of the franc fort is not a technocratic policy, but
one strongly backed by the French people,' Mr Michel Sapin, the finance
minister, said.
The Sofres poll showed slightly less support - 60 per cent - for the
European Monetary System in general.

response yesterday both from advisers to President-elect Bill Clinton and
from the outgoing Bush administration.
The offer, seen as a test of Mr Clinton's intentions, seemed likely to
exploit growing unease in the west over continued military action. But US
officials insisted that the three main partners in the anti-Iraq coalition -
the US, France and the UK - remained united.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, Mr Clinton's spokesman, said the only way Iraq
could enjoy a more peaceful relationship with the US was to change its
behaviour and comply with United Nations resolutions passed after the Gulf
war.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the outgoing White House spokesman, added that Iraq was
already bound by a ceasefire under the terms of UN resolution 687, which
brought the Gulf war to an end in 1991. 'If Iraq complies with that, then
there should be no problem,' Mr Fitzwater said.
Along with the ceasefire proposal, a principal cause of dispute between the
UN and Baghdad was removed last night when the UN accepted Iraq's offer to
let flights by UN weapons inspectors resume unconditionally.
Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's UN ambassador, said his country would allow UN
weapons inspectors to fly directly from Bahrain to Baghdad. Mr Rolf Ekeus,
head of the UN Commission set up to identify and eliminate Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, said this offer 'should be taken seriously' and guarantees
had been given about safety of the aircraft. He said the flights would be
resumed as soon as feasible.
Sir David Hannay, the UK representative at the UN, speaking after Security
Council members met to discuss the crisis for the first time since attacks
against Iraq began on Wednesday, said Iraq's response on the inspection
flights was satisfactory.
Baghdad's ceasefire offer, to take place from 5am GMT today, was described
as 'a gesture of goodwill' to the new US president and came after US and
British aircraft had again attacked targets in the northern air exclusion
zone. US F-14 and F-4G aircraft had fired at Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and
air defence radars in the northern no-fly zone in incidents described by US
officials as 'defensive attacks'. Washington had also announced that another
aircraft carrier and three more warships were on their way to the eastern
Mediterranean.
The Iraqi Revolution Command Council said it would stop shooting if the
allies followed suit. This would give the new US administration 'time to
study the no-fly zones in the north and south', and to 'establish a
constructive dialogue'.
The Security Council talks took place amid signs of alarm about the
intensity and persistence of coalition military operations. Statements in
Moscow, seemed to conflict with earlier Russian support for the allied
response.
In London, Downing Street reacted cautiously to the ceasefire offer.
Officials said Prime Minister John Major had spoken by telephone to Mr
Clinton and they showed 'complete identity of view'.
However, earlier evidence of growing disquiet prompted officials to hint
that Mr Major had acted to restrain the US in calls to President Bush at the
weekend. Granting a Commons debate, the prime minister assured MPs all
decisions had been taken in close co-operation with coalition partners and
in accordance with UN resolutions.
France also indicated its unease about US attacks near Baghdad, but defended
the legality of allied air strikes in the two air exclusion zones in which
French Mirages took part.

FT  20 JAN 93 / Industry price rises exert strains on inflation policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MANUFACTURERS IN the UK are pushing up prices in the wake of sterling's
devaluation, putting pressure on the government's anti-inflation strategy.
Downing Street said yesterday it was confident the government's inflation
target of between 1 and 4 per cent would be met, in spite of the spate of
price rises. But one senior minister said: 'It is the old story. Companies
seem to be throwing away their advantage, just when they should be strongly
placed for recovery.'
Price rises in the past few weeks include:
More than 7 per cent on electrical goods from Siemens UK;
8 per cent on float glass from Pilkington;
Up to 13 per cent on steel from British Steel;
Up to 7.5 per cent on Ford cars;
Up to 12.5 per cent on personal computers.
Mr John Major yesterday reiterated to MPs the importance he attaches to
reducing inflation, 'so we can create lasting jobs for the future'. Downing
Street also said it expected price rises to be offset by price falls
elsewhere.
Manufacturers in hard-pressed industries such as building materials and
chemicals expect no price increases until demand picks up. Ready-mixed
Concrete, the cement maker, said: 'First we have to stop them falling'.
However, importers of finished goods from the continent pointed out that
devaluation meant cost increases in sterling terms of 15 per cent.
The government had hoped that manufacturers would respond to devaluation by
freezing prices and pushing up market share against imports, thus helping
the balance of payments. However, Pilkington and British Steel have been
losing money.
It is not yet clear that all the mooted price rises will take effect.
Pilkington and British Steel have tried to raise prices without success in
the past few years. In glass, steel and personal computers prices have
actually fallen sharply.
In cars, it is not yet clear whether the latest price rises will be whittled
away by discounts. However, the latest price rises from Ford come hard on
the heels of a rise in October last year. Prices were also raised late last
year by Rover and Vauxhall.
Analysts said that industrial price increases could leave some companies
exposed if the French franc were also forced to devalue. In addition, the
deepening recession in continental Europe continues to push prices down in
some products, thus offsetting the effects of devaluation for companies
exporting to the UK.
For the government, the dilemma is that if price increases fail to stick, it
will be principally because the UK economy is not recovering as fast as
companies hoped. In that case, industry's behaviour to date suggests that
inflationary pressures will merely be postponed until recovery arrives.
