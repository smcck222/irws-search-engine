FT  18 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Miyazawa edges forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO hoped that the Miyazawa doctrine, outlined in a speech by the
Japanese prime minister in Bangkok at the weekend, would enunciate a set of
clear principles and launch bold proposals for Asian economic and security
co-operation will have been disappointed. He qualified Japan's commitment to
democracy by stressing it would take a pragmatic approach to the development
of human rights and made only one firm proposal - a forum to discuss the
comprehensive development of Indo-China.
Yet the speech should be welcomed as the clearest sign yet that Japan is
gradually developing a more strategic approach to foreign relations,
independent of its US mentor. Japan has long had a vital economic role
within Asia as a source of capital and as a market for goods. By proposing
this forum, Mr Miyazawa has taken Japan a further step into the political
domain. With the US and the European Community preoccupied in the Balkans
and the Middle East, Mr Miyazawa provided a timely reminder that Asia has
its own tinder box of territorial disputes and that over the next decade the
region's fast-growing economies may use their wealth to fund an Asian arms
race.
His speech was also important for what it ruled out - Japan's re-emergence
as a military power and any ambition to create a trading bloc in response to
the development of the EC or the North America Free Trade Association. It
stressed the continued centrality of the US role in the region.
Asian security is underpinned by a complicated web of agreements: US
alliances; growing collaboration between Asean states; the five-power
defence agreement involving the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and
Singapore; Russia's military co-operation with China and its relations with
Vietnam and North Korea.
This complexity cannot be distilled into a single forum modelled on the
Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe. So Mr Miyazawa quite
sensibly stressed the importance of promoting overlapping discussions
leading to a mutually recognised sense of interdependence.
However, the Miyazawa doctrine also implies the recognition of some
difficult issues at home. His call for more open economies requires a more
open Japanese rice market. His desire to defuse territorial conflicts points
to a badly needed initiative from Tokyo on its dispute with Russia over
islands known in Japan as the Northern Territories. These items are the
short-term price of an emerging statesmanship from which Japan and the world
have much to gain.

<TEXT>
Sir, We note that Remploy appears in your list ('Patronage determines who
serves at the top', January 14) of the Top 40 quangos for 1990-91 at number
27 showing expenditure of Pounds 191m. These figures may be misleading.
In fact, the government contribution to Remploy in the form of a subsidy to
compensate for the extra costs of its disabled employees was Pounds 75m,
including capital investment of Pounds 12m.
You are probably aware that Remploy is a private company, limited by
guarantee, whose members are the directors who are in turn appointed by the
secretary of state for employment. The company's objective is to employ
severely disabled people who would not be able to find employment in a
commercial environment and who would cost the state a similar amount in
disability and other benefits.
The balance of Remploy's expenditure was covered by sales of Pounds 114m,
including exports of Pounds 6m to countries such as the US, Japan, France
and Germany. Remploy is a leading company in many of its core activities
such as clothing, furniture, packaging and medical products. Sales last year
rose to Pounds 120m, including Pounds 10m exports, demonstrating the highly
commercial nature of the company in a recessionary environment.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Menu with bewildering array of choices: Jurek Martin asks
whether Clinton is able to make the tough decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former senior Reagan administration official was ready to be charitable.
'Of course Clinton's got the brains. You only had to look at the way he
handled his economic summit in Little Rock to see that. No president I can
think of could have pulled that off, and in sentences that made sense. But
the real question - which we still don't know the answer to - is, can he
choose?'
All presidents who enter office, as Bill Clinton does on Wednesday, with
incomplete political resumes do so under a cloud of uncertainty. John
Kennedy's maturity was doubted, as was Jimmy Carter's experience and Ronald
Reagan's awareness of the real world. Old professionals, like LBJ, Gerald
Ford and George Bush, occasioned fewer initial qualms.
Yet American democracy, more than any other, has an extraordinary capacity
to revive, even sometimes to reinvent, itself. There is no preferred
training ground for the White House, no political apprenticeship at the end
of which a man (still only a man) is deemed qualified for the presidency. Of
the last 11, from FDR to Clinton, four had been state governors, five
prominent in Congress, one came from the military and one, the departing
George Bush, was mostly a career public servant. Five moved up from the
vice-presidency, three in emergency and one, Richard Nixon, after an
eight-year wait in the wilderness.
Sometimes it seems that the US is a country without a sense of political
continuation. The list of notionally qualified men who never became
president is very long. The authority of the two main political parties has
been in decline for 25 years, to the point where last year the ultimate
anti-politician, Ross Perot, won nearly one vote in five.
The circumstances of the 1930s Depression may explain the radical
differences between Hoover and Roosevelt. But there was nothing comparable
in the wind of the times to suggest that Reagan would actually carry out a
policy agenda so very different not only from that of Carter, the Democrat,
but also from the middle-of-the-road tenets of his own Republican party.
Yet this capacity to inject new blood and ideas into the body politic has
also been America's strength, unnerving though it may occasionally seem to
an outside world that must live with the elephant that is now the only
superpower. Inside the country, it is nothing less than extraordinary to
observe the extent to which the advent of Clinton is seen not as a high-risk
gamble but as a window of opportunity to fix those parts of the national
machine which have simply stopped working as they should. This same sense
even extends to the prospect of renewed US leadership in tackling everything
from Bosnia to Baghdad. It is not a bad initial mandate for a man elected
with the second-lowest share of the vote this century.
Great expectations indeed are held out for Clinton, still just 46 years old,
shaped by the turbulent 1960s, the first president born after the second
world war and the first in modern times ever publicly to have opposed a war
in which the US was actively engaged, with a wife as impressively well
educated as himself, addicted to policymaking and golf, sometimes short of
temper, worldly-wise but not well versed in the way the world works - in sum
the self-proclaimed 'different kind of Democrat'. The question, as the old
Reagan hand put it and as George Bush tried to say on the campaign trail, is
whether or not he can take the tough decisions.
Some objective circumstances will make his beginning a little easier. First,
he inherits an economy somewhat on the mend. Only the wilder optimists
believe a new boom is round the corner. Consensus forecasts of about 3 per
cent real growth in the year to come will not be sufficient much to reduce
either unemployment (over 7 per cent) or the budget deficit (projected by
the Bush administration at Dollars 300bn and rising). But if the deficit
limits his freedom of action, at least he ought not to be hammered by a
series of depressing monthly statistics in the immediate future.
Second, there is a will on the part of the Democrats who control Congress to
work with him not against him, while the Republican party, especially in the
House, is falling captive to those very conservative ideologues whose
adversarial policies contributed to Bush's defeat. The Democrats seem to
have heard former Vice-president Walter Mondale's warning that, if the party
does to Clinton what it did to President Carter, it would spend the next 28
years in opposition.
In fact, its liberal wing is much weaker now, and Ted Kennedy, its leader, a
man only with a past. Editorials in The New York Times, criticising Clinton
for sending his daughter to a private school and for picking a Washington
lobbyist, Ron Brown, as commerce secretary, do not carry the same potent
menace.
Third, he has picked a cabinet widely approved for its apparent competence
and its variety, except that three-quarters are, along with the Clintons
themselves, lawyers by training. Commendation has, naturally, not been
universal. Among the more vivid dissenters is the New Republic magazine,
which falls into the muscular neo-liberal camp and which derisively
describes Warren Christopher, the secretary of state-designate, as a
'pragmatist mainstream realist liberal conservative moderate centrist' with
the views of 'a sphinx'.
Several special-interest groups, including the American Jewish lobby and
assorted trade and economic factions, have complained at their
under-representation. Others have questioned Clinton's relentless search for
women and members of minorities for senior positions. But the general
impression is that the cabinet will not be short of ideas.
Finally, there is a palpable sense that Clinton is the man of the hour,
someone who has set up his government so he can control it. He will not be
disconnected, as Reagan was in his second term, nor selective in his
interests, Bush's great failing, nor inclined to moralise, Carter's fatal
tendency.
Washington can be a catty town, only too willing, as it is already doing, to
keep a scorecard of campaign promises broken. But it also desperately wants
a new social and political Camelot, even with a fondness for fast food. The
New York Times gently wondered on its front page recently whether Clinton
can live up to his billing as the new national 'idol'. One of his closest
advisers has taken privately to calling him 'the sun king'. Public
fascination with Hillary Clinton, who may well be the most distinctive first
lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, is on an equivalent scale.
But, by definition, honeymoons do not last for ever. If the premise of the
Clinton administration is to change things, so many issues demand attention,
from healthcare to Bosnia, that a question of priorities instantly emerges.
Clinton intends to attack domestic issues first. That has been the thrust of
the transition period, in the appointment of economic and social policy
officials before anybody else, in the Little Rock economic summit, in his
recent meetings with car industry leaders and with his budget team, and last
week's with healthcare experts. He has engaged in some private foreign
policy cramming, talking on the phone to foreign leaders, but even the likes
of Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, or John Major, Kiichi Miyazawa and
Yitzhak Rabin, prime ministers of the UK, Japan and Israel, have had to
accept undetermined places in the post-inauguration queue.
The domestic agenda promises to be heavy, embracing job creation and
budget-cutting and reforms in healthcare, welfare and education. It will be
heavy not only because of the complexities of the issues themselves and the
budgetary constraints on them but because, the honeymoon notwithstanding,
there is no great consensus over the right policy proposals.
The continued focus on a new petrol tax provides a classic illustration.
Whatever the economic and environmental arguments in favour, the coalition
of interests arrayed against - the oil and trucking industries, the public
transport lobby, the rural constituencies, - remains powerful enough to
bring about a legislative battle should the subject ever reach Congress.
Clinton will have to weigh very carefully the risks of being bogged down in
such a quagmire on an issue that he ducked during the election against the
possible knock-on effects on more prized, but equally contentious, reforms
such as the introduction of universal healthcare. If cutting spending
assumes its expected importance in the first term, he is going to need all
the help he can get.
Just because the Democrats run Congress it cannot be assumed they will roll
over and play dead at every presidential proposal transmitted from the other
end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Clinton has the minor advantage that a quarter
of the 103rd House of Representatives are new members, and many are imbued
with attitudes close to his own. But that does not obviate the need to
stroke Congress and to set clear legislative priorities, as Reagan did in
1981 but as Carter did not four years before. History suggests - and Bush,
who lost control of the domestic agenda early on, would concur - that the
first year is critical.
But history also attests to the pull on any president of foreign policy  -
and in this the challenge to Mr Clinton is radically different from that
confronting his immediate predecessors. The US is now the only global
superpower, yet, even without the evil empire, the world is no safer a
place. As Bush said in a farewell address, the US cannot afford now to be
'passive and aloof'.
Clinton has been careful in the transition never to disagree with Bush on
foreign policy. Indeed, freed of election constraints and the ever-cautious
advice of James Baker, Bush's last 10 weeks have seen it pursued in what
many suspect to be a Clintonian manner - particularly in the intervention in
Somalia and the harder line on Bosnia. Bush has also tied up some
outstanding business, such as nuclear arms control with Russia.
There seem to be two clear schools of thought abroad in the new
administration: the emphasis on diplomatic negotiation, embodied in the
appointment of Christopher, viewed not only by the disapproving New Republic
as the star graduate of the Cyrus Vance school of foreign policy; and the
more robust, even interventionist approach associated with Les Aspin at the
Pentagon, Jim Woolsey at the CIA and, on Bosnia, with Anthony Lake, the new
national security adviser in the White House.
Uneasily perched in the middle, at least until his term expires in
September, is General Colin Powell, the esteemed chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff. He has already expressed reservations about excessive
cutting of the defence budget, reorganisation of the duties of the four
military services and too reflexive a deployment of US forces overseas.
There are powerful members of Congress, such as Senator Sam Nunn, head of
the armed services committee, who share some of his opinions. Bipartisan
political mileage may exist now for the use of force, but if three years
hence US soldiers are still getting shot at in distant corners of the world,
as they were in Vietnam, then the Republicans, and possibly Ross Perot, will
have an election issue.
Nobody disputes that Clinton will lead an administration active in foreign
policy, partly because of his inclinations and partly because events will
demand it. But there is no clear sign yet of where, or how, he will want to
get involved first. Relations with western Europe, however, could be
seriously tricky, not only over the Balkans but over such issues as steel
imports and Gatt in general. The Middle East peace process will demand early
attention if it is to be kept on track. Russia cannot be ignored, nor, for
different reasons, can Japan and China. Above all there are the issues of
peacekeeping and peacemaking, not only in the current hotspots (Bosnia,
Somalia, Iraq, Cambodia) but in a fistful of ethnic wars waiting to erupt.
At home and abroad, therefore, the Clinton plate is full. The big difference
from his favourite fast food restaurant is that, at McDonald's, the choices
are limited - and affordable.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Radical restructuring needed to increase house
supply in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SHEILA MCKECHNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your suggestion on the phased abolition of Miras ('Housing choices',
January 13) is sensible and could be marginally improved by linking it to
notional rather than actual interest rates. Could we also call it mortgage
subsidy?
However, fiscal changes are only one side of the housing equation. At
present personal housing subsidies (housing benefit, Miras and income
support to unemployed home-owners) amount to Pounds 13.3bn and bricks and
mortar subsidies of Pounds 3.76bn. This produces little incentive to
increase supply and results in the housing version of musical chairs where
repossessed homes end up being occupied by homeless families on housing
subsidy. This creates an unemployment and benefit trap for those looking for
work and does nothing to stimulate house building and renovation, a key to
wider economic recovery.
We now need to look at the supply and affordability of rented housing. I am
afraid that that needs a much more radical restructuring than your 'modest
investment incentives for landlords'.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Pension surpluses treatment may give rise to costly
option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof CHRISTOPHER GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the account of Prof Roy Goode's comments on
pension fund surpluses ('Thorny questions for pension group', January 12).
Whether or not a corporate pension fund surplus should be regarded as 'akin
to the rise in the value of a house' depends, I think, on the nature of the
company's obligations in the event that the fund fails to generate a
sufficient return to cover contractual or advertised target pension
payments. If the company is obliged to underwrite the negative equity that
arises in such circumstances but cannot realise surpluses in the converse
situation, it is effectively being asked to write a put option on its
investment portfolio. The implication is that it will need either to follow
a very conservative investment policy or make an appropriate charge. While
no one will decline the free gift arising from unexpected surpluses, it is
not obvious that future pensioners would choose ex ante to purchase options
of this sort.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Opportunity lost through ACT system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL TOWNSEND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a UK tax adviser working in the Netherlands, I often walk into the
brick wall that the ACT system erects on the use of the UK as a holding
company jurisdiction ('Failure to act on surplus distorts companies'
behaviour', January 12). While my European colleagues are able to expound
the virtues of their tax systems in an attempt to create additional
investment in their countries, the best advice I can give is normally to
move investments from the UK. Every day I therefore witness lost business
opportunities to other European countries directly caused by the UK's ACT
system. The Department of Trade and Industry is right to be concerned.
I would whole-heartedly support an 'international holding company' regime.
Not only would that play to the strength of the professional service and
banking sectors in the UK, it should also cause an increase of revenue for
the government on the basis that the well-advised company would not come to
the UK at present.
Such a regime could be successful. There would be a willing 'sales force' in
the professional community. Persuading the tax authorities to support their
efforts would undoubtedly be more difficult. This could turn out to be a
case for intervention before afternoon tea at the Inland Revenue.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Power levy a political 'quick fix' that would
endanger industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr B C BATEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was deeply concerned to read of proposals, reportedly gaining
ministerial favour, to add a special levy to consumers electricity bills to
solve the pit closure problem ('Pits rescue may need power levy', January
11).
One can understand well the problem that miners and British Coal face, but
to suggest that it can 'solved' by passing it on to others is almost beyond
belief. It is no solution since:
It will prop up the electricity supply industry which is already delivering
the most expensive electricity in the European Community after Germany and
Italy;
It will give further credence to the fossil fuel levy - a charge which we
have repeatedly urged should be transferred to the wider burden of taxation
rather than to penalise a particular section of the community;
It will impose significant extra charges on the paper and board industry as
a big purchaser of electricity and coal;
As proposed, it would appear an addition to the existing EC proposals to
levy carbon based fuels (CO/energy tax); proposals which were originally
believed to be part of the strategy to control climate change but are now
unashamedly emerging as pure taxation and nothing else.
It seems that the administration is prepared to prejudice other mainstream
UK industry for the sake of the political 'quick fix' without the need for
recognition or understanding of the long-term ramifications. Surely the
factor is relative cost - industry and particularly large intensive users in
competition with those abroad must have internationally competitive costs?
Failure to grasp or act upon this simple imperative only encourages the
demise of manufacturing industry in the UK.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: Nigerian anger on the march - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As I was passing the Nigerian High Commission in London the other day, I
noticed that that the protestors have re-appeared. 'Babangida, out, out]'
and 'Academic Freedom Now]' went some of the placards. The demonstration
reminded me of the permanent vigil that used to be mounted just across the
road outside the South African Embassy in Trafalgar Square. Some Nigerians
are clearly becoming aware of the similarities between repressive regimes,
black or white.
Nigeria has long been known for its chronic corruption. More recently there
has been the repeated postponement by the military of the promised return to
civilian rule. Marching for Fausa, the new play at the Royal Court Theatre
Upstairs, suggests that the problems are getting worse, but also that there
is an incipient rebellion by the educated young, and especially the women.
Fausa does not appear; she is the girl from university who is taken off to
become the 11th concubine of the Minister of Culture. The potential uprising
is about how long this sort of thing can go on. What happens when the oil,
on which the country depends for a large part of its revenues, runs out? How
long can coup succeed coup without fulfilling the promises of reform?
The authenticity of the background is not in doubt. Biyi Bandele, the young
Nigerian author of the play, has been a journalist in his home country.
Fausa captures beautifully the Nigerian claim that they have a relatively
free press and the fact that practically everyone knows that it is
manipulated. It can be just as corrupt as much of the rest of Nigerian
society.
The other fact which anyone who has visited Nigeria will recognise
immediately is the front room to the Minister's office. Here sits the
secretary typing away, answering the telephone and firmly denying that the
Minister is within. It costs the businessman, who thinks he has an
appointment, 6,000 naira to get even a hint that he might see the Minister
in the end.
Then there are the police. Decent fellows at heart, they become more
desperate towards the close of the month as their salaries run out. It was
lucky, one of them says to a victim of theft that he was robbed by Slow
Poison Joe because he is the last of the gentleman burglars in town: he only
wants to negotiate a deal in order to give the property back. With such
corruption above them, why should ordinary people be more honest?
Fausa claims, however, that there are far more sinister forces at work.
Young people disappear, not just Fausa, but others who may never leave
prison again, and others who are murdered. A parallel with Argentina in the
1970s comes to mind and, as in Argentina, it is the mothers and the women in
general who begin to protest: also one or two journalists.
The chief of the protesting journalists, and indeed the only one shown, is a
young woman called Telani Belarabe played by Susan Aderin. She, too, ends in
chains for her pains, her woman editor having sacked her for going beyond
the bounds of a reporter's discretion.
Fausa is not yet a brilliant play. Even under Annie Castledine's direction,
some of the flashbacks jar a bit and there is sometimes a spurious use of
music. But it is remarkably mature for a writer is his mid-twenties and it
is undeniable that it has something to say. The irony lies in the title
which one is tempted to confuse as Waiting for Fausa. Are the potential
rebels really marching, or are they just waiting in the hope that someone
like Godot might turn up? Perhaps the answer is deliberately left ambiguous.
Nevertheless, here is a sign of genuine, articulate Nigerian anger. The
people from the High Commission ought to go and see it. So should the
demonstrators, for at least it shows there is hope.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: An American room in London - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Welcome to London, Frank Lloyd Wright. You are one of the key architects of
the 20th century and the arrival of one of your rooms in its entirety, with
all its furniture and curious timber idiosyncrasies at our fabled and august
Victoria and Albert Museum, is indeed a cause for celebration.
It was way back in 1974 that Edgar Kaufmann Jnr of New York City gave to the
V&amp;A a most generous gift: the office Frank Lloyd Wright had designed in the
1930s for his father at the family-owned business, the Kaufmann Department
store in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
I remember Edgar Kaufmann Jnr well. I often met him in New York at his Park
Avenue apartment where he sat in rather chill state beneath a great Rodin
bronze contemplating one of the finest of Monet's 'Waterlilies'. He had been
delighted to donate the Frank Lloyd Wright room to the V&amp;A because he wanted
to see the architect represented in Europe, and he had a strong admiration
of the V&amp;A and its then director Sir John Pope-Hennessy. Sir John, in his
later years at the museum, was keen to acquire important things of quality
from the 20th century.
The subject of the gift was always a hard one to raise with Mr Kaufmann. He
was very sore indeed about the whole subject of the V&amp;A and it is nothing
less than a tragedy that he died in 1989, having waited 15 years for
something to happen. If he had lived, I think he would have been pleased to
see the installation and appreciate the trouble that the excellent curator,
Christopher Wilk, has taken.
Frank Lloyd Wright is not as well known here as might be expected. The new
biography of him by Meryle Secrest (Chatto and Windus, Pounds 20.00) does
little to further our knowledge of his architecture, and achieves the
remarkable feat of making his fascinating, wild and contentious private life
and his strange Welsh origins completely boring. So what is the average
visitor to make of this fine room, and how does this American architect and
designer fit into the museum's view of the 20th century?
Wright was born in 1867 and lived until 1959 (almost an exact contemporary
of Sir Edwin Lutyens) and, apart from being one of the most brilliant and
prolific architect designers of the 20th century, he also devised theories
of life and design that are appropriate to any architectural debate today.
He invented what he called 'organic architecture', which was the basis of a
unifying theory of architecture as a discipline that embraced structure,
materials and ornament, and which included the design of the interior, the
furniture, the textiles and everything to do with a building as part of one
work of art.
By the end of his life he had designed over 1,000 buildings and built more
than 400. He reinvented the American house and created environments of
simple elegance and repose that owed not a little to his interest in the
orient. The Kaufmann room reflects the patron's interest in commissioning
the finest of contemporary designs for his department stores - and for his
own houses: Edgar Kaufmann commissioned one of Wright's most wonderful
private homes, 'Falling Water', in the forests of Western Pennsylvania.
Edgar Kaufmann, father and son, were important clients for Wright. They seem
to have revived his career in the Depression years of the 1930s. At 'Falling
Water' the Kaufmann family enabled Wright to crystallise his vision of man
in union with nature. The house is open to the public and shows Wright at
his best.
The V&amp;A's room will act as a marker: that the 20th century is important, and
that a key part of its architectural story is now international. The room
has been accurately re-erected and is surrounded by impressive Wright
artefacts which the V&amp;A has recently acquired. The accompanying book by
Christopher Wilk is a model of scholarly research and an enjoyable read. The
story of the room is a microcosm of the story of Wright's reputation and
career.
The most important element of the room is the cypress and plywood mural over
the desk. It looks like a plan of one of Wright's horizontally planned
buildings - beautiful, especially in the way it fades into the surrounding
timber walls. The yellow pattern in the furniture and carpets has proved
fugitive and the room lacks colour. But in every other respect it is
perfect, and seems to justify the whole idea of the 'period room' as a
didactic tool which is under threat at the V&amp;A.
This installation is much to be welcomed. It is shaming that it had to wait
so long and sad that so much of the funding had to come from America; but
this in no way lessens the importance of the gifts. They are welcome and the
exhibit is a brilliant example of international scholarship. May it not be
the last.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: Meistersinger at the Met - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The plot of Wagner's bourgeois comedy may hinge on the matter of singing,
but this, as much as any of his works, is also an opera for orchestra. The
orchestra's is the first dramatic voice we hear, telling us about Eva's and
Walther's sidelong glances in church; then in the third act comes Wagner's
most virtuoso study in opera without voices, for the mime episode of
Beckmesser's sneaking into Sachs's workshop. Elsewhere too - in the
kerfuffle at the end of the second act, or at the entry of the masters in
the third - scenic events seem to be there as vehicles for orchestral
luxury.
James Levine, who of course conducts the Met's new production, is not one to
avoid his opportunities, and his patronage once again, as for the Ring here,
of the team of Otto Schenk (producer) and Gunther Schneider-Siemssen (sets)
is not the action of a man keen to set some alternative fire alight on the
stage. But he unfolds the orchestral splendour in a curious way. The
overture is staggeringly dull, with a smooth string-led sound wherever
possible and everything entombed in a perfectly even march tempo. Total
absence of thrill. Total absence of heedlessness. And when, as so often, Mr
Levine chooses to lavish care on a scene as a study in passacaglia or a
sequence of motivic variations, the exercise is as self-contained and as
unprovoking as if one were reading it in a treatise. The prelude to the
third act, taken so slowly, by far exaggerates the premonitions of Parsifal;
the playfulness of the apprentices as all lumpish - and thereby sadly
consonant with their appearance and stage behaviour. Only the finale starts
to come to life with a large, long breath, but then the achievement is
mostly the impressive chorus's.
The cast is generally less secure. When Francisco Araiza gets to the prize
song, one at last understands why he might want to be singing Walther: the
sound is rapturous and the style good, both together well conveying the
impression of a young nobleman. But he needs to save himself earlier in
order to get there, and a feeling of strain hovers around. Karita Mattila as
Eva also has her problems. She settles marvellously into here scene with
Sachs, but before that her singing is inclined to skid off the rails -
perhaps partly because she flails her arms about 'girlishly'. The quality of
acting which Mr Schenk encourages or condones - no gesture too obvious, no
cliche unusable, no reaction excessive - altogether passes belief.
Into this nightmare of staginess, with Mr Schneider-Siemssen's ponderous
three dimensional construction out of a cheap fairy-tale book (a railway
tunnel through which all can make their entrances in the last scene, with a
Disneyland castle in the blue haze behind), comes Donald McIntyre as Sachs.
He doesn't exactly sing the role, except for odd phrases of a sudden squared
strength and firmness. But what he does do - musing through phrases with a
head voice that goes right into falsetto, and slips to a pin drop whisper in
the vast space; ruggedly tackling other sequences as if this were
Schoenbergian sprechgesang - is astonishing. It's all the more so since he's
on stage with a Pogner, Jan-Hendrik Rootering, who could clearly provide the
most gloriously and gravely sung performance as Sachs. Mr Rootering offers
far and away the surest musical satisfaction of the evening, and keeps his
majestic figure aloof from the idiocies of the staging. But Mr McIntyre
gives something more. In his honesty, and in his self-exposure, he seems to
be alone on the stage. Or rather, he seems to be not on the stage at all,
but telling us about some person and some story of far greater significance
than we can see.
The understanding, the quiteness and the generosity he brings to the part
make the opera's treatment of Beckmesser seem particularly cruel, and
Hermann Prey's impersonation of the town clerk lacks the spitefulness that
might have made the cruelty appear deserved. Lars Magnusson as David, once
over some awkwardness, is a ray of light: young, fresh, daring of voice, and
an engagingly easy stage personality. The incoherence of the whole makes his
and David's cheery informality especially sympathetic.

Britain's banks, which have experienced a decline in public esteem surpassed
only by the monarchy. Evidence will be provided to show that the banks are

Still talking money, but in this case won through straightforward

One of them involves a fraudulent hospital appeal, another is a 'Nigerian

still manages, remarkably enough, to find gullible victims.
On a markedly more elevated plane, we come a little closer to the Russian

semi-dramatised portrayal of the relationship between art and political
commitment in the life of the poet Alexander Pushkin.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Madness' tours the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Love may be madness, yes. But it took the truly baroque mind of the Spanish
playwright Lope de Vega to put love in a madhouse and to show madness
inspiring love to new peaks. In a wonderful production of Madness in
Valencia at London's Gate Theatre which is about to tour the country, two
sane (and beautiful) people, Floriana and Erifila, are forced to take refuge
in a lunatic asylum. Meeting there, they fall in love; and the madness all
around them intensifies their passion and gives them new emotional freedom.
Men both sane and mad fall for Erifila and scheme to take advantage of her;
other sane women fall for Floriano and enter the madhouse to be with him. As
with The Great Pretenders, which the Gate staged this time last year, you
not only follow the plot like a whodunnit, you are also kept on tenterhooks
waiting to find out simply what kind of play this really is. Comedy or
tragedy? The tone keeps shifting; you never know how it will end. Actually,
the ending is the only weak point in the play - but that hardly matters,
because it has been so riveting getting there.
The language of the play fluctuates likewise. In the first half-hour all the
parlance is so prosaically unadorned that one presumes this is a play Lope
dashed off in a hurry (he wrote hundreds); and one misses the astonishingly
rich utterance of, say, his Punishment without Revenge - shown at the Gate
in 1990. Then, however, in the madhouse, both comedy and poetry suddenly
flower.
Though Floriano and Erifila fall in love with each other at once, each also
assumes that the other is genuinely mad, and speaks aside in a stream of
metaphors: 'a blank mind in a perfect form,' 'a cathedral without a roof,'
'a golden chalice filled with air when it could hold the purest wine,' 'I'm
standing looking at a madman, knowing full well I would follow him to the
ends of the earth.' The moon - which traditionally makes people luna-tic -
is invoked every which way. 'Any woman would be the moon that inspired this
man's madness,' 'Even the moon and stars stare at you, such is your beauty.'
Doors open on to the brilliantly educated baroque view of the world.
Floriano (whose assumed name is Orlando Furioso) and Erifila become Lancelot
and Guinevere to each other ('How's Gawain?' 'Green with envy.') When
Floriano is interrogated about love, he speaks with such fluent
philosophical command that we are amazed, even though we know - unlike his
audience onstage - that he is sane. David Johnston's prose translation
underlines all the times when Lope's thought parallels Shakespeare's.
Floriano reminds us of Edgar as poor Tom in Lear; and the play ends with the
quip 'All the world's a madhouse - and all the men and women merely mad.'
Laurence Boswell's staging, as always, gives us changing riches in the
little upper room that is the Gate. Paul Russell's simple series of curtains
is eloquently used to suggest the baroque layerings of this topsy-turvy
mad/sane world; and Rae Smith's costumes combine period flavour with intense
characterisation. At first it bothers you that Simon Kunz has none of the
beauty to which every female onstage credits him, but his playing has the
fervent integrity to make you suspend disbelief. Caroline Loncq negotiates
both tragic and comic sides of Erifila's situation with great charm and
skill. The production's only miscalculation is in making the doctor behave
like a slapstick madman.
This is the sixth play by Lope that I have seen. With each one, he appears a
different and larger playwright, and more intoxicating; I shall soon have to
start teaching myself Spanish. He makes theatre itself thrilling, even while
he makes you see through it to the subject that he is dramatising so surely.
I owe my introduction to four of these plays to Laurence Boswell's stagings
at the Gate, and my gratitude, ever since the 1990 Punishment without
Revenge, has been immense. Simply, these productions have been among the
greatest boons of life in London.

FT  18 JAN 93 / People: Weaver's prudent move pays off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than three years after joining Murray Johnstone, the independent
Glasgow fund managers, Giles Weaver is to become its managing director. He
will take over as md from Nick McAndrew, currently chairman and md, when
McAndrew becomes executive chairman at the end of June, and should succeed
McAndrew, 58, when the latter retires from an executive role in two years'
time.
Weaver, 46, was recruited to Murray Johnstone in 1990 from the Prudential
where he ran pension funds. Murray Johnstone needed him as investment
director to stop a haemorrhage of pension clients who had been dismayed by
the company's poor investment performance. Weaver improved communication
with clients and re-positioned the funds in the market. The pension fund
performance duly improved.
The engaging Weaver, who will stay in charge of pensions at Murray
Johnstone, joined the Prudential in 1986 from Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh
fund managers. The move to Murray Johnstone meant a return to Scotland,
though Weaver does not have the negligible commuting time of many Scottish
fund managers. He lives in East Lothian and drives nearly 70 miles to
Glasgow early every morning, eschewing news programmes for full text
recordings of the classics of English and French literature.
With Weaver's promotion Stephen Anderson will take charge of the UK
department and David Briggs will take over responsibility for investment
trusts.

Des Lee, information technology director at B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's do-it-yourself
retailer, resigned unexpectedly last week.
Lee, who says the separation from B&amp;Q was entirely amicable, is one of the
best known figures in UK data processing management. News of his departure
spread quickly through the digital grapevine and brought a number of job
offers.
But Lee, life president of the UK IBM computer-users' association, says he
is in no hurry to return to full-time employment. He will carry out a number
of consultancy projects over the next few months, some of them for B&amp;Q, and
then decide his future. His departure from B&amp;Q seems to have been a
consequence of the arrival last year of Alan Smith as chief executive; he
has been busy establishing a new direction for the company and bringing in
his own senior staff to help him implement it.
Lee's dp achievements include Limnet, the London insurance market system,
installed while he was head of IT at Lloyds of London, and B&amp;Q's supply
chain system - which he modestly describes as Britain's best.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Management: Delivering the goods - Andrew Baxter says
centralised distribution may not always make sense in the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG BEFORE the European single market came into being, companies adapted
manufacturing strategies to anticipate the new conditions. But it was soon
clear that making such strategies work depended on the ability to deliver
the goods. Logistics - the fine art of warehousing and distribution
management - has a special significance in the single market.
Over the past five years, the more forward-looking companies have asked
themselves what kind of distribution chain they need to serve customers
across continental Europe in the most cost-efficient way and have acted
accordingly.
The conventional view was that companies would reduce the number of
warehouses in Europe, moving from a national structure to a regional
approach or even a central warehouse. That view still holds good.
But there is evidence that some companies are becoming aware of the dangers
of over-centralising and are rethinking their European logistics strategies.
Getting logistics right is probably harder than sorting out a manufacturing
strategy. For every company there are one or more different solutions - it
all depends on what you are producing, where your customers are and how you
want to serve them, says David Ecklund, European commercial manager for
Caterpillar Logistics Services.
A report due next month from the Illinois-based Council of Logistics
Management says that some companies have recognised that their initial
attempts at logistics restructuring in Europe may have been too aggressive.
The report, co-ordinated by Kevin O'Loughlin, a partner in Andersen
Consulting's logistics strategy practice, and James Cooper, director of the
Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation, says the conventional
wisdom that centralised warehousing is the optimal form of integration in
Europe must be challenged.
Moreover, it says, the diverse market characteristics in Europe, as well as
the varying degrees of market penetration, are not well served by a uniform,
homogeneous logistics strategy.
'Centralisation does rely on product standardisation in both the formulation
and packaging,' says Cooper. This view is confirmed by other European
logistics experts. Joachim Miebach, founder of Frankfurt-based logistics
consultancy Miebach &amp; Partner, says some of the initial enthusiasm about
central warehousing has waned, as it was found not to be feasible.
'The big hindrance is national peculiarities,' he says. 'They have not
disappeared.' For example, many companies thought they would be able to
introduce product labels with as many as five languages on each, but they
are still having to produce different versions for each national market,
The report also says that growing road congestion is confounding
manufacturers' abilities to provide speedy deliveries to some parts of
Europe from a single site.
Even so, O'Loughlin points out that some companies are still happy to have
one central warehouse for Europe. He cites the example of Becton Dickinson,
the US medical and diagnostic products group, which is moving to a single
distribution site outside Brussels from 22 sites around Europe.
On the other hand, a large consumer packaged goods company included in the
council report said it had decided to move to a single distribution site but
would have to modify the plan. Having closed warehouses in Italy, it now
believed it needed a warehouse in southern Europe to ensure it could serve
customers there properly.
Fortunately, few companies built one central warehouse for their entire
European business because they realised it would not work. Instead, they are
using centralised distribution as one element of a diverse logistics package
and are adopting centralised logistics management for a handful of regional
warehouses. This is the approach at Whirlpool, the world's largest white
goods group, which is expanding fast in Europe following its takeover of the
Philips large domestic appliance business.
The company has reduced its warehouses from 45 in 1985 to 16 and aims to end
up with six or seven, says Ugo Simonelli, Whirlpool Europe's logistics
chief.
With relatively high transport costs for white goods, Whirlpool aims to keep
its products travelling in one direction and it would not have made sense to
have had a single warehouse for goods coming from several manufacturing
sites in Europe. On the other hand, spare parts distribution is being
concentrated on one or two warehouses.
A mixed approach is also being adopted at SKF, the Swedish roller bearings
group. The company, which Miebach has been advising for the past 15 years,
is preparing the ground for a new centralised warehouse in Belgium which was
to have supplied all customers. Instead, SKF will now supply automotive
customers directly from its factories and use the warehouse for deliveries
to dealers.
One of the most important messages from logistics experts to companies
considering changing their logistics structure for the single market is not
to lose flexibility by blindly pursuing the economies of scale which
integration provides.
Consequently, in industries where the eventual level of product
harmonisation is hard to predict, companies are being advised to use
third-party distributors rather than invest heavily in capital-intensive
warehousing which they may later regret.
This is providing unexpectedly good opportunities for sophisticated
third-party companies such as CLS. O'Loughlin cites one client, a leading US
supplier of medical products, which has traditionally used its own warehouse
facilities and storage retrieval systems. 'One of our key suggestions was to
rethink that, to use more third-party distributors so that it could remain
flexible and adaptive - then begin investing in its own infrastructure once
the market environment stabilises.'
Whatever happens to the central warehouse ideal, it is clear that the
logistical restructuring of Europe has only just begun. Many companies have
shrunk from reorganising their distribution, either because they were not
sure how 'single' the single market would be, or because they have been wary
of restructuring a function that historically has been closely allied with
national sales and marketing outlets.
But, as the council study says, most managers express little doubt that
logistics restructuring will occur, sooner or later.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Management: Bowing to pressure and the corporate hierarchy /
A look at how public humiliation is part of business life for junior
employees in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese management style is often described as Confucian in concept and
family-like in feel, with an enlightened manager deftly and sensitively
handling crises, inspiring corporate loyalty and, as the Chinese sage put
it, 'cultivating his own character such that he can govern other men'.
But closer scrutiny of the crisis-handling techniques of managers at large
Japanese companies suggests that Confucius would definitely disapprove of
their readiness to show anger and of the apparently common practice of
openly condemning younger employees who have erred.
A research affiliate of the Ministry of Labour surveyed 3,359 companies,
large and small, to gather information on whether managers were coping with
shinjinrui, younger Japanese employees who come equipped with broader
outlooks on life and, reputedly, less devotion to the corporate cause.
In dealing with a young employee's fictional 'failure' in the workplace,
managers were asked to choose suitable responses. Instead of subtlety and
sensitivity, 39.1 per cent chose 'a public scolding' and 48.2 per cent
selected 'a scolding in a separate room'.
Only 18 per cent of managers would 'comfort' the mistake maker, and 16.9 per
cent would pass on sage advice at a bar or restaurant. However, just over 3
per cent said they would be incapable of saying anything, while 10.4 per
cent would use a third person to deliver the criticism.
The sometimes harsh methods of dealing with young employees were also
highlighted in the advice columns of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the leading
Japanese daily. A young women, describing herself as an employee of a large
trading house, complained that she was routinely scolded and humiliated by
her section chief. She was advised to examine her behaviour and alter it to
reduce tension in the office.
One motive for the public scolding is to maintain a clear definition of the
corporate hierarchy, putting the younger worker in his or her place, and
reaffirming the power of the manager. A 27-year-old who resigned from a
Japanese brokerage house expressed frustration at the constant pressure to
'know his place', which he saw as attempt to force younger employees into
accepting corporate goals by limiting their perceived options.
'You could see people changing because of this pressure. They were made to
feel very small. I couldn't accept that,' the former securities house
employee said.
The hierarchy is physically reinforced in the Japanese office, as the
section chief has a desk perpendicular to a long row of desks at which
lower-ranked employees sit. In that position, the manager 'overlooks' the
section, allowing him - only 2.3 per cent are women - to issue orders in a
manner confirming and asserting his authority.
Younger workers are generally expected to wait for their turn at the top
table and are told to regard their early years as a kind of 'boot camp' at
which the rough edges are removed. There has been increasing debate about
the need to reward merit and encourage 'creativity', but that movement was
partly stimulated by concern about securing staff in the midst of a labour
shortage.
The souring of the economy and the easing of that shortage have prompted a
return to traditional desk arrangements and techniques. Even managers are
under pressure, with companies such as Pioneer Electronic, the audio and
video equipment maker, cutting costs by forcing senior staff to take early
retirement packages.
Rather than larger companies setting management standards, small and
medium-sized enterprises appear to be more enlightened, at least according
to the survey findings. Within larger companies, 10.4 per cent more managers
would prefer to scold an employee openly than to retire to a separate room -
the trend was reversed at smaller companies.
Mari Okutsu, planning manager at the Japan Vocational Ability Development
Association which conducted the survey, said she was initially surprised
that larger companies appeared to treat employees more harshly but, after
further thought, concluded that the criticism was commonplace and not likely
to disrupt the working environment.
'The relationships between employees and managers at smaller companies are
deeper and so they would choose to discuss problems in a room. Relationships
are more professional in a large company, roles are more clearly defined and
scoldings are common,' said Okutsu.
Managers are trying to deepen their contacts with younger staff, some of
whom enter a company determined not to become a dutiful, old-style manager.
Conversation may be a problem. The survey found that 77 per cent of managers
like to talk to staff about hobbies or recreation, 59 per cent chat about
work and 24 per cent discuss 'life and living', presumably after a few
water-weakened whiskies.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Social housing in Hackney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hackney Borough Council has selected LAING HOMES SPECIAL PROJECTS as
development partners for London's largest social housing project to date.
The Pounds 64m scheme will see the transformation over the next five years
of the Holly Street Estate in Hackney and provide 1,050 new and refurbished
homes.
System-built in the early 1970s, the estate achieved notoriety for its
multiple social, economic and environmental problems. Now this is all set to
change with the proposed new and refurbished homes constructed following
traditional Victorian street patterns, and offering predominately low-rise
accommodation with gardens.
Tenure will be mixed. The Council will retain some properties for rent,
while the majority will be managed by a consortium of housing associations.
One hundred new homes will be set aside for the elderly, including those
needing sheltered accommmodation, and for people with special needs. In
addition 218 properties will be offered for sale and there will also be some
self-build projects.
A training centre for construction and other skills will be established with
a target to create 200 permanent jobs during the lifetime of the project.
Demolition works for the project will commence towards the end of 1993.
Funding will be provided by the Department of the Environment for City
Challenge and Estate Action, the Housing Corporation and from private sales.

FT  18 JAN 93 / People: Bricom - new patient for McCann
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony McCann, who has been given the job of breathing new life into the
heavily indebted Bricom industrial conglomerate, knows full well the perils
of being a company doctor. You tend to get called in when everyone else has
failed and your reputation suffers if you can't revive the corporate
patient.
In terms of company doctors, McCann, 52, is not in the same league as the
likes of Sir Lewis Robertson and David James, and after a couple of
unsuccessful rescue attempts - Harland Simon and Astra - he needs to chalk
up a success if he is to make a reputation for industrial turnrounds.
The attraction of McCann's latest challenge is that he is inheriting a group
with some good companies and, unlike the Harland Simon case, he says that he
is 'assured of the banks' support'.
Originally a management buy-out of the non-financial interests of British &amp;
Commonwealth, Bricom has lurched from one financial disaster to another. It
was bought by a Swedish investor group in June 1990 that itself later
collapsed and was taken over just over a year later by Sweden's Nordbanken.
The latter then had to be rescued by the government and Bricom's ultimate
parent is now the state-owned Securum, formed at the beginning of 1993 to
take over Nordbanken's loans and bad debts.
McCann, who was found through headhunters, has been given the job of
developing a motley collection of businesses which include passenger and
cargo handlers Serviceair; ANC, the parcel delivery service; and Neville &amp;
Gladstone office supplies. They have a total turnover of around Pounds 300m
a year.
McCann is a relatively recent recruit to the ranks of company doctors. He
spent 17 years at Black &amp; Decker before moving to Sunbeam International and
then Littlewoods where he was managing director of the mail order business.
His first rescue job was Astra Holdings. Although he was unable to prevent
the receivers being called in, he describes it as 'a moderately successful
outcome for the banks, though less so for the shareholders'.
Meanwhile, Lord Eden, the former conservative MP, has stepped down as
Bricom's non-executive chairman, along with chief executive Allan Jonnes,
and executive director Matt McBride.
*****
Keith Clark, 48, has been elected senior partner of the London based
international law firm Clifford Chance. He has been elected for a five-year
term in succession to Nigel Fox Bassett who has been senior partner since
May 1990.
Clifford Chance - the UK's largest law firm with 230 partners - was formed
in 1987 through a merger of Clifford Turner and Coward Chance.
Clark joined Coward Chance in 1971 where he specialised in banking and
finance. He was made a partner in 1977. Since 1981, however, he has been
particularly involved in sovereign debt restructuring and recently has taken
the lead in the development of Clifford Chance's central and eastern
European practice.
Geoffrey Howe, the firm's managing partner, describes Clark as a good
communicator and long-term stategist.
He will take up his role in May after a short sabbatical.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Minister will examine plans to save Bart's from closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR BRIAN MAWHINNEY, the health minister, will this week visit St
Bartholomew's hospital in the City of London to examine plans to save it
from closure under the government's Tomlinson report proposals.
An intense campaign to keep Bart's open has been mounted since October, when
Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report recommended closure of the City site and
amalgamation of services with the Royal London in the east end.
The rescue plan devised by hospital managers envisages scaling down Bart's
but retaining a range of specialist services including cardiac, cancer,
renal and Aids; a healthcare centre for minor injuries and screening, and
weekday accident and emergency services catering for 500,000 City workers.
Dr Mawhinney visited all hospitals identified for closure or reorganisation
before Christmas. The alternative proposal for Bart's had not been developed
then, and he agreed to return when the hospital's managers had completed
their plans.
Department of Health officials stressed yesterday, however, that ministers
had not yet made decisions on Bart's or any other Tomlinson recommendations.
These decisions are likely next month. The Tomlinson proposals are intended
to reduce hospital beds in the capital and switch resources to family
doctors and community services.
Sir Bernard's report did not include a financial analysis of his
recommendations, and follow-up studies on financial implications
commissioned by the Department of Health should reach the government this
week.
Ministers will then have to weigh the political unpopularity of closing
hospitals with the financial consequences of keeping them open. The
relatively expensive London teaching hospitals are subsidised in the NHS
internal market.

FT  18 JAN 93 / British Gas warns against break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has warned that it would be severely weakened in its competition
with large utilities overseas if it were broken up.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is reviewing British Gas, is
considering the break-up of the company among other options as a way of
encouraging more competition in the market.
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator,
is pressing for British Gas's pipeline business to be hived off so that true
competition can be achieved.
Executives at British Gas stress that the company is not afraid of
competition in the market, 'but we passionately believe the UK needs
champions overseas'. It is seeking to diversify into gas markets overseas
which are opening up as other countries privatise their national utilities.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said: 'We've been able to
use our financial strength to expand abroad and generate a numerous amount
of jobs and opportunities, not only for British Gas, but for a 100 other
companies.'
The company has stressed in its evidence to the commission the levels of
efficiency it has achieved. A recent study by Arthur D. Little, the
consulting group, showed that, on average, British Gas has about 25
days-worth of gas stored.
That is an important measure of efficiency - the lower the number of days'
gas stored the better the system can balance supply and demand.
The same study showed Germany to have 40 days' gas usage stored, the US 70
days' and France more than 100 days'.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Mergers forecast to surge this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a possibility of a 'mini-boom' in merger and acquisition activity
in the UK this year, Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance says today.
It says in its monthly review that, after 'probably the most dismal year
ever' for corporate financiers, the level of company acquisitions should
increase in the coming year.
The review acknowledges that economic uncertainty has left companies
reluctant to embark on corporate acquisitions, an activity which always
involves considerable risks.
But it says that 'as and when there are real, sustained signs of an
improvement in the economy', many of the medium-sized and larger, cash-rich
public companies will decide the time is right to buy.
Mr Richard Mead, national director of corporate finance for Ernst &amp; Young,
says: 'The aftermath of Black Wednesday means that British companies may now
provide good value for money to foreign buyers. When combined with the
larger UK-based companies that have been sitting on cash during the
recession, they provide a pool of potential buyers.'
Ernst &amp; Young also says it expects the upturn in buying interest to coincide
with the emergence of more companies for sale. It envisages that companies
financed in the mid to late 1980s by venture and development capitalists -
often as management buy-outs - will come on the market as backers seek to
realise their investments.
Companies that are financially stretched but are going concerns are also
likely to look for new owners, it concludes.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Outline deal agreed for power sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGIONAL electricity com-panies in England and Wales have agreed with the
generators the broad commercial principles by which - in the next batch of
long-term contracts - they will buy at least some of the power that will be
generated from coal.
The successful outcome of the heads-of-agreement talks is important because
it will help negotiations on the final contracts after the energy white
paper is published next month.
The heads of agreement, negotiated between 11 of the 12 regional companies
on one side and National Power and PowerGen on the other, cover issues
including the impact of possible tax changes and the effect of inflation on
prices.
Details of prices per electricity unit and volume - which could cause some
conflict - will be completed in bilateral contract talks between each of the
regional companies and the generators. It is unlikely, however, that any of
the 11 will sign anything before publication of the white paper. One
regional company executive said the preliminary deals were likely to form
the commercial basis on which most, and possibly all, coal-fired power is
traded from April. He said: 'They are not the answer to the pit closures,
however. They sustain the rump of pits which can survive in the competitive
market but they do not create in themselves any extra room in the market.'
The agreement is based on the assumption that the generators will buy 40m
tonnes of coal from British Coal in the year from April and 30m for each of
the next four years.

FT  18 JAN 93 / EC setback for ministers on contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community laws protecting the jobs and pay of workers affected by
company mergers will apply even when public services are contracted out to
the private sector, in the view of UK lawyers assessing the implications of
a recent judgment in the European Court of Justice.
The legal opinion, which is directly contrary to the views of British
ministers, has emerged on the eve of a conference in London organised by the
government about ways in which companies can compete for public services
worth Pounds 1.5bn. Uncertainty about the reach of the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as Tupe, has cast
a shadow over the current extension of contracting-out in central government
services.
The UK government has argued that the Tupe legislation does not normally
apply to contracting out. Private-sector companies taking on work from the
public sector are thus free to sack workers who transfer to them under the
contracts, and alter their pay and conditions.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said last month about
contracting-out: 'There is not normally a transfer of an undertaking in
these circumstances.'
The European court ruled recently in the case of Rask v ISS Kantineservice
that the EC Acquired Rights Directive, on which Tupe is based, does apply
when a service is contracted out.
An analysis of the case by Ms Melanie Tether, a solicitor with the law firm
Norton Rose, says: 'The ruling reflects the willingness of the ECJ to put
the protection of employees' rights before the promotion of commercial
interests.'
The Rask case, which began in Denmark, arose when Philips contracted out its
staff canteen, underlining the fact that Tupe also applies to contracting
out within the private sector. The contractor, ISS, agreed to manage the
canteen in return for a fixed fee. However, Philips continued to own the
premises and equipment. It also retained economic control over the service
provided because it continued to fix the prices charged for food and
restricted the canteen's customers to its own employees.
Ms Tether believes the court has thus backed a minimalist definition of what
does not constitutes a 'transfer' and an 'undertaking' and has undermined
many of the UK government's arguments on the limits of Tupe.
One argument apparently undermined by Rask is that Tupe cannot apply when a
public authority contracts out a service because the statutory duty to
provide that service remains with the relevant authority. The government
argument that no transfer has taken place unless the contractor acquires the
assets used in the service is also disputed by the Rask judgment.
The judgment is likely to alert unions to the fact that Tupe applies to
private sector contracting-out and might even affect routine corporate
restructuring. Private sector contracting-out is a much bigger market than
that in the public sector.
It is not yet clear, however, how long after a transfer the Tupe regulations
will apply.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Why industry giants are angry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS, ANDREW BAXTER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE industrial power users are angry that the government is considering a
deal that would reduce Imperial Chemical Industries' electricity costs.
Companies such as British Steel and Blue Circle Cement say they must also be
offered cheaper electricity to allow them to compete effectively against
Continental counterparts.
The largest consumers are arguing that any special deal for ICI's
chlor-alkali plant at Runcorn, Cheshire, should also be offered to them.
Smaller users are concerned that the prices they pay would increase if the
largest groups were allowed to opt out of the electricity spot market.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is understood to be negotiating a deal for
ICI, which has been campaigning for cheaper electricity for its Runcorn
plant since the electricity industry was privatised and its power costs for
chlorine production increased by 60 per cent. The group has threatened to
stop production there, with the loss 7,000 jobs, unless cheap supplies can
be secured.
British Steel said it 'could not afford not to be included' if new
arrangements were introduced for big industrial users of electricity. The
company hopes to find out more this week when the Energy Intensive Users
Group meets Mr Eggar.
British Steel said: 'There is no doubt that we are very much at a
disadvantage compared with our principal European competitors. We are paying
30 per cent more than steelmakers in France and the Benelux countries.'
United Engineering Steels, the Rotherham-based specialist steels producer
owned jointly by British Steel and GKN, reacted positively. Mr Graham
Mackenzie, chief executive, said: 'First, we are delighted to see ICI making
the breakthrough. Secondly, we want some of this too, please.'
Mr Mackenzie said this was the first indication that the government was
willing to look at the problems caused for big electricity users by
privatisation of the electricity supply industry. But the continuation of
the nuclear levy remained a cause for concern.
UES said it was one of the UK's top six energy consumers, buying Pounds 50m
to Pounds 60m of electricity a year. Mr Mackenzie said the company would
talk to PowerGen, its supplier, and the Department of Trade and Industry to
see whether a similar arrangement could be made for UES.
One question, however, would be whether such an arrangement could cover the
peaks and troughs of energy use in electric arc steelmaking, compared with
the more steady energy loads in chlorine manufacture.
Mr Ian McKenzie, chief executive of Blue Circle Cement, a subsidiary of Blue
Circle Industries, said the company was pleased that the government had
recognised that very large UK users of electricity were at a disadvantage to
industrial competitors in continental Europe which paid substantially less
for their electricity.
He added that electricity prices paid by Blue Circle in 1987-88 were broadly
comparable with those of its European competitors.
The group's UK electricity costs had risen by 50 per cent since then while
competitors' costs had stood still and had fallen in some cases.
Pilkington, the glass manufacturer and middle-sized electricity user, said
it was concerned that if concessions were made to very large users, in
effect restoring the pre-privatisation subsidy, then middle to large users
might pay more because the final cost structure in the industry would not
have changed.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Mergers and acquisitions surge forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a possibility of a 'mini-boom' in merger and acquisition activity
in the UK this year, Ernst &amp; Young Corporate Finance says today.
It says in its monthly review that, after 'probably the most dismal year
ever' for corporate financiers, the level of company acquisitions should
increase in the coming year.
The review acknowledges that economic uncertainty has left companies
reluctant to embark on corporate acquisitions, an activity which always
involves considerable risks.
But it says that 'as and when there are real, sustained signs of an
improvement in the economy', many of the medium-sized and larger, cash-rich
public companies will decide the time is right to buy.
Mr Richard Mead, national director of corporate finance for Ernst &amp; Young,
says: 'The aftermath of Black Wednesday means that British companies may now
provide good value for money to foreign buyers. When combined with the
larger UK-based companies that have been sitting on cash during the
recession, they provide a pool of potential buyers.'
Ernst &amp; Young also says it expects the upturn in buying interest to coincide
with the emergence of more companies for sale. It envisages that companies
financed in the mid to late 1980s by venture and development capitalists -
often as management buy-outs - will come on the market as backers seek to
realise their investments.
Companies that remain financially stretched but which are going concerns are
also likely to look for new owners, the report concludes.
Ernst &amp; Young stresses that although the outlook suggests an increase in
merger and acquisition activity it will be some time before a sellers'
market reappears.
The review says the expected improvement in the market for selling unquoted
companies 'will be more apparent in the form of an increase in the number of
deals and better saleability than in the form of higher prices'.
The price gap between unquoted and quoted businesses, it adds, is unlikely
to be narrowed substantially.

FT  18 JAN 93 / School inspection plans condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG attack on the government's plans for regular school inspections, a
central feature of Mr John Major's Citizen's Charter, is made in a paper
published today by the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing think tank.
Dr Sheila Lawlor, the centre's deputy director, condemns the school
inspection regime being established by the new Office for Standards in
Education (Ofsted) as too prescriptive.
She says it is biased in favour of 'progressive' teaching methods and their
protagonists.
Every state school is to be inspected at least once every four years under
reforms carried through last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education
secretary. Private teams will carry out inspections but will be licensed by
Ofsted, which will also be responsible for assigning inspectors to schools.
Dr Lawlor condemns Ofsted's inspection guidelines as 'too detailed and
prescriptive', requiring over-lengthy inspections - 33 days for secondary
schools with fewer than 400 pupils, 57 days for those with more - covering
too wide a field.
'Unless the basis on which inspection rests is radically different to that
proposed, there is every danger that the new arrangements will perpetuate
the worst of the old system and undermine the central task of the objective
reporting of standards,' argues Dr Lawlor.
She also criticises Ofsted's recruitment and training arrangements as likely
to lead to an inspectorate dominated by the personnel and outlook of Her
Majesty's Inspectorate, the national inspection body prior to Ofsted.
'The upshot will be to perpetuate the poor practices of HMI and local
authorities in the past, in which emphasis is put on schools perpetuating
favoured educational theories rather than on achieving the highest standards
by whatever methods they choose,' she says.
A General Teaching Council should be established in England and Wales 'to
raise the morale of teachers and restore their standing more generally in
society', according to a paper published today by the National Commission on
Education, an independent think tank.
The paper, by Mr Stuart Maclure, former editor of the Times Educational
Supplement, says the powers of the council should include establishing a
register of teachers and administering disciplinary procedures.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Pit strike ballot to be considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE of the National Union of Mineworkers will decide on Wednesday
whether to back a strike ballot for a day of action against pit closure on
February 18.
On the same day the new leader of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, Mr
Neil Greatrex, who is far less sympathetic to the government than his
predecessor Mr Roy Lynk, will have his first meeting with Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
There has been some informal division of labour between the two main mining
unions on legal challenges to the government, arranged through Nacods, the
pit supervisors union. The election of Mr Greatrex means both unions will
take a similarly hostile stance towards privatisation.
The NUM has not resorted to industrial action in the campaign against
closures for fear of antagonising popular support. But activists are
pressing for some action, if only to give focus to a day of action. A
delegate conference in October gave the NUM executive the authority to call
a ballot whenever it wished.
February 18 might be the day on which unemployment officially exceeds 3m and
has been named by the TUC as Jobs Action Day. The TUC last week backed away
from encouraging public-sector workers to take industrial action. It wants
'broad-based action to demand change'.
NUM lawyers are expected back in the High Court today arguing that British
Coal is in contempt of last month's ruling that the fabric of pits should be
maintained while the government reviews the future of the 31 pits originally
scheduled for closure.

FT  18 JAN 93 / British Gas warns against effects of break-up option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has warned that it would be severely weakened in its competition
with large utilities overseas if it were to be broken up.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is reviewing British Gas, is
considering the break-up of the company among other options as a way of
encouraging more competition in the market.
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator,
is pressing for British Gas's pipeline business to be hived off so that true
competition can be achieved.
Executives at British Gas stress that the company is not afraid of
competition in the market, 'but we passionately believe the UK needs
champions overseas'. It is seeking to diversify into gas markets overseas
which are opening up as other countries privatise their national utilities.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said: 'We've been able to
use our financial strength to expand abroad and generate a numerous amount
of jobs and opportunities, not only for British Gas, but for a 100 other
companies.'
The company has stressed in its evidence to the commission the levels of
efficiency it has achieved. A recent study by Arthur D. Little, the
consulting group, showed that, on average, British Gas has about 25
days-worth of gas stored in its system.
That is an important measure of efficiency - the lower the number of days'
gas stored the better the system can balance supply and demand.
In the same study, Germany was shown to have 40 days' gas usage stored, the
US 70 days and France more than 100 days.
McKinsey and Co, the management consultancy, is soon to complete a study of
British Gas's headquarters operation. The consulting group is also looking
at its Global Gas business and comparisons between British Gas and its
overseas competitors.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Virgin to press Heathrow case today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today respond sympathetically to Virgin Atlantic's
demands for slots at Heathrow airport but will underline its determination
not to become embroiled in the airline's battle with British Airways.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chairman, will meet Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, tonight to press his case for access to Heathrow after his
victory earlier this month in a libel battle with BA.
Mr Branson is expected to call for a review of the way slots - take-off and
landing rights - are allocated and for the creation of a regulatory body for
airlines.
Virgin renewed its warning yesterday that it was ready for action against BA
in US courts unless its rival came up with an act of 'good faith' to
demonstrate that it had changed its attitude to competition.
Lawyers for Virgin are examining different types of possible legal action
unless BA makes a 'concession'. These include anti-trust action in the US,
action under European Community competition laws, or even prosecution in the
UK of BA staff alleged to have hacked into Virgin's computers.
Mr MacGregor is expected to tell Mr Branson that he cannot interfere with EC
rules by which BA slots at Heathrow are protected as long as an airline is
using them.
But the transport secretary is expected to point out that large-scale
investment over the next few years, including the construction of a new
Pounds 300m traffic-control centre, will pave the way for new slots to be
created at the London airport. Virgin would be a front-runner in competition
for such slots.
Ministers are deeply conscious of the political dangers of the government
becoming embroiled in the Virgin-BA row. But they are aware also that Mr
Branson's hopes of expanding his fleet depends on access to Heathrow.
Virgin's aim is to increase its fleet from eight to between 16 and 18
aircraft, operating to the world's 12 largest cities, by 1995.
Virgin acknowledged yesterday that the gesture it sought from BA to drop the
threat of legal action did not necessarily involve the surrender of Heathrow
slots. It said it wanted a 'change of attitude'.
The results of an internal investigation of BA activities at the heart of Mr
Branson's recent libel action will be discussed at a BA directors' meeting
on Friday, the airline said yesterday. It said the results were not expected
to put 'further pressure' on Sir John King, chairman, or Sir Colin Marshall,
chief executive.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Supermarket floorspace grows rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKETS are building outlets more quickly than the grocery market is
expanding, but this is unlikely to produce an all-out price war, says a
survey published today by Verdict, the retailing research company.
Grocers and supermarkets have seen cumulative volume sales growth of 1.1 per
cent over the past three years, the report says, but floorspace has
increased by 7.8 per cent in the same period.
Verdict blames weak sales growth on the recession and the increasing
maturity of the market. It says that with 800 superstores in the UK, and the
big retailers opening about 80 new stores a year, the opportunity to find
new sites with little competition is diminishing.
These factors may explain why the biggest food retailers have resorted to
more aggressive price promotions. Verdict says the price skirmishing is
unlikely to escalate into a war. The big three retailers, J. Sainsbury,
Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, are investing too much in new stores to
be able to cope with the repercussions of heavy discounting.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Executive pay rises slow to average 6.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH executives' pay rises slowed to an average of 6.3 per cent last year
compared with 9.3 per cent in 1991, says the latest index from the Noble
Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries, Michael Dixon writes.
The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well
as salaries and bonuses.
Chief executives of companies with Pounds 600m-plus turnovers continued to
pull ahead of other managers. An average rise of 7.2 per cent took the big
company chiefs' total package to just over Pounds 250,000 compared with a
total for all managers of Pounds 80,577.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Bucking the trend: Costs tightly controlled in acquisitions
spree - A company headed by a Labour MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINDING your Ps and Qs has a special meaning for Mr Geoffrey Robinson, the
Labour MP who is executive chairman of Birmingham-based Transfer Technology
Group.
It is nothing to do with etiquette.
'We are supplying equipment to improve companies' productivity and quality
rather than raise their capacity,' he says. 'People will invest in them in
downturns and upturns.'
The P and Q effect is one reason why TransTec has managed to weather the
recession so well, in spite of what at first glance looks an unpromising
line-up of customers - the automotive, aerospace and steel industries figure
heavily - and products such as manifolds and aluminium castings.
In July TransTec announced a 63 per cent rise to Pounds 3.46m in first-half
pre-tax profits. The result looks incredible in today's environment, but the
real story of how the company is bucking the trend lies beneath the surface.
TransTec is the successor company to Central &amp; Sheerwood, in which the late
Robert Maxwell was the largest shareholder. A reverse takeover in May 1991
involving Mr Robinson's Transfer Technology put the MP for Coventry North
West into the chair of the enlarged company.
That provided the springboard for a raft of acquisitions that have turned
TransTec into a tightly controlled collection of specialist engineering
businesses. Products range from seals and rubber pro-ducts for the oil
industry to texture rolls for the steel industry and turbine blades.
The acquisitions help explain how TransTec boosted turnover by 64 per cent
to Pounds 49m in the first half of last year. But what about the profits?
Mr Robinson points to a number of tough acquisition criteria. Companies have
to be heavily export-oriented - that is vital for a specialist engineering
company, he says, given the decline in the UK's industrial base. They also
need a gross margin of 50 per cent. 'Selling abroad is so costly,' says Mr
Robinson. They should be low-volume businesses with big market shares which
do not compete head-on with the Japanese and their export markets and
product applications should be widely spread.
The result of the acquisition spree is a company with about 1,900 employees
 -almost all of whom are in the UK - and with more than 75 per cent of its
business outside the UK. It has an enviably even spread of sales between
European, north American and the fast-growing Far Eastern markets.
On top of that is a strong technology base and a drastically reduced
dependence, compared with two years ago, on the automotive industry, where
Ford Europe is its biggest customer.
In the group are a smattering of world and European market leaders and some
niche businesses exploiting trends that have overridden the recession.
Mr George Baker, sales director at the control technology division, picks
out two examples. TransTec's electrochemical technology for making turbine
blades is selling well in the growing market for gas turbines in power
generation.
And its new manufacturing technology for fuel injection systems, he says, is
benefiting from tighter emission controls, especially in the US. Customers'
scrap rates from existing equipment are rising as they try to meet the new
rules.
TransTec's most recent acquisition, the Matrix grinding machine business, is
best known as half of the controversial Matrix Churchill machine tool
business.
Once companies have been acquired by TransTec costs are tightly controlled.
'That is vital,' says Mr Robinson. 'With 95 per cent of our commitment in
the UK we cannot afford to let slip the cost advantage of being based here.'
Manufacturing strategy is another important element. With some exceptions,
Trans-Tec subcontracts basic manufacturing but retains responsibility for
research and development, assembly, testing and marketing.
'This suits our philosophy,' says Mr Robinson. 'Why put money into building
manufacturing plants when it can be used to develop overseas sales?'

FT  18 JAN 93 / Reshape union link, says Blair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BLAIR, shadow home secretary, yesterday rejected proposals for a new
form of Labour party associate membership for trade unionists.
Mr Blair called on BBC television for Labour's relationship with unions to
be recast on the basis of one-member-one-vote for all members.
He rejected any institutional role for the unions in the selection of the
party's parliamentary candidates.
His comments, reflecting deep concern that Labour is not going far enough to
dismantle its traditional relationship with the unions, foreshadow an
intense struggle in the shadow cabinet to win the support of Mr John Smith.
The Labour leader has signalled that he is inclined to support a compromise
proposal that would involve giving 'associate membership' to trade unionists
who paid the political levy and declared their support for the party.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST FINANCIAL services firms are experiencing lower than normal business
volumes and are no more optimistic about their prospects than they were
three months ago, according to the latest quarterly survey of industry
trends.
The survey, conducted by the Confederation of British Industry and
accountants Coopers and Lybrand, found, however, that 25 per cent of the 309
institutions surveyed in December were more optimistic about business
prospects, up from 3 per cent in the previous quarterly survey conducted in
September.
The only sector of the financial services industry reporting a decline in
optimism was life insurance, where more than half of those surveyed expect
growth to be constrained by the prospect of new legislation.
Overall, 41 per cent of respondents reported a rise in non-performing loans
in the previous three months and 28 per cent said they expected a further
rise in the next three months.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Women still miss out on top jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR after the launch of Opportunity 2000, the equal opportunities
programme, the proportion of female main board directors remains negligible,
according to figures in the 1993 edition of Crawford's Directory of City
Connections, Roland Rudd and David Goodhart write.
The number of women reaching key executive positions in Britain's top
publicly-quoted 1,278 companies rose only from 124 to 150 out of a total of
5,641 senior jobs.
The number of women who hold chairmanships has fallen from five to two - Ms
Jean Tyrell at Sirdar, the textile manufacturer, and Ms Aleksandra Clayton
at Alexanders Holdings the car dealer.
Ms Ruth Henderson remains the only woman chief executive, at Alexon Group,
the retailer.
There are a few women managing directors: Ms Anita Roddick at Body Shop; Ms
Barbara-Anne Maxwell at Tamaris, the nursing home operator; Ms Bridget Towle
at Towles, the knitwear manufacturer; and Ms Michelle Kavanagh at Irish
property developer Power Corporation.
The growth areas for women are company secretary, with 7 per cent women  -
and investor relations officer, with 17 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Consumer optimism 'very low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER OPTIMISM about the economy was at a lower level in the last quarter
of last year than at any time since the start two years earlier of a
quarterly survey published jointly by Business Strategies, an economics
consultancy, and Gallup, a market research group.
There were particular concerns late last year about rising unemployment and
inflation according to the survey, which is published today. Northern
regions showed a big slip in consumer confidence.
The survey coincided with Britain's withdrawal last September from the
European exchange rate mechanism, which was a big setback for the
government's economic policy.
Even though the report suggests that confidence in December showed a rise
from the extremely low levels for October and November, the survey will be
bad news for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. He has been hoping that his
package of growth measures in the November 1992 Autumn Statement, with
recent cuts in interest rates, will have lifted sentiment among consumers
and businesses as a prelude to economic recovery.
Consumer spending in the last quarter of last year fell 0.3 per cent
compared with the previous quarter after a 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter
fall in the July to September period, estimates from the survey suggest.
Mrs Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said
the survey, based on interviews with 6,000 people, indicated that consumers
were 'shell shocked' by economic events. She said, however, that confidence
could gradually recover as the effects of the 3 percentage point fall in
base rates to 10 per cent since September start to bring down the cost of
mortgages.
The survey said Scotland, the Yorkshire and Humberside region and north-west
England saw the biggest falls in confidence in the fourth quarter compared
with the third. Previously people in these regions had been relatively
cheerful about the economic outlook.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Lamont says civil servants suggested costs payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday defended strongly his decision
to accept a Treasury contribution towards his personal legal costs as
backbench MPs prepared to call this week for tighter rules on all payments
to ministers.
Mr Lamont said he had not solicited the Pounds 4,700 paid by the Treasury
towards legal costs arising from the eviction of a self-styled sex therapist
from his London home.
He insisted on BBC television that the payment had been suggested by senior
civil servants after they judged that the proportion of his legal expenses
covering press relations was attributable to his public office.
The remainder of the bill for solicitors Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners was
met by an anonymous Pounds 18,000 donation channelled through Conservative
Central Office.
His comments, confirmed last week in a report by National Audit Office, the
independent watchdog on government spending, are unlikely to deflect Labour
attacks on the payment.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has signalled a concerted attack on what
he regards as a general decline of standards in public office.
Later this week the opposition will highlight the business links of former
cabinet ministers with privatised industries, arguing that their influence
is behind the government's refusal to tackle 'excess' profits.
The cross-party Commons committee on members' interests will today add fuel
to the controversy over Mr Lamont's legal bill by arguing that anonymous
donations should in future be declared in the register of member's
interests.
The report attaches no direct blame to Mr Lamont for failing to do so,
concluding that the existing rules are not clear on the point.
Labour MPs are preparing to press the chancellor on whether he declared the
gift for income tax purposes. Yesterday Mr Lamont indicated he regarded his
tax affairs as a personal matter.
Separately, MPs on the Commons public accounts committee will this week
question former and present Treasury officials on the Pounds 4,700
contribution.
A majority on the committee is expected to back tighter accounting rules
which would alert parliament to all such payments.

FT  18 JAN 93 / SFO chief sees bigger role for City tribunals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL CRIMES are likely to be prosecuted more often by City tribunals
rather than through the criminal courts, according to the Serious Fraud
Office, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting complex and
serious fraud.
The City's self-regulatory organisations each have tribunals with the power
to prosecute firms and individuals for breaches of their rules.
Mr George Staple, the SFO's director, said: 'In the past we have not given
sufficient weight to the City's separate regulatory regime.'
He refused to comment on specific cases, but there has been widespread
criticism of the SFO's decisions to prosecute all defendants in the Blue
Arrow and Guinness cases through the criminal courts.
Some lawyers believe aspects of those cases might have been more effectively
prosecuted through City tribunals.
The Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator of the securities
industry, has a tribunal with powers to disqualify firms and individuals
from practising in the City and to levy unlimited fines, although there is a
Pounds 50,000 limit on the amount it can force a defendant to pay in
restitution to anyone suffering as a result of a breach.
An executive with the authority said its tribunal had been used 'seven or
eight times' in the past couple of years, but not in any of the recent
high-profile fraud cases.
A City tribunal could only have been used in the Guinness and Blue Arrow
cases - or in any case of serious financial malpractice - with the SFO's
permission. According to Mr Staple a tribunal cannot operate if the SFO
decides to mount a criminal prosecution, because it might prejudice the
criminal hearing.
The advantage of a tribunal, Mr Staple said, was that the judge was an
expert and the level of proof required for a successful prosecution was less
than in a criminal court. He wanted a tribunal to have 'full powers' to
award compensation to a victim.
He stressed that courts would be used for cases of serious fraud involving
City firms or individuals.
The powers of City tribunals to prosecute and punish are being examined by
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, as part
of the government-sponsored review of UK financial regulation.
Mr Staple said there was an argument for giving SIB civil powers to
prosecute alleged insider dealers. He was opposed to decriminalising the
offence, even though there had been calls from City practitioners for this
and widespread criticisms of the government's proposed new insider-dealing
legislation.
Reformed City tribunals might play a role if plea bargaining is introduced
as an option in fraud cases, as Mr Staple has recommended.
Mr Staple said that in an appropriate case a plea of guilty from an
individual in a criminal case could bring him or her a lesser prison
sentence than might otherwise be expected, or a conditional discharge.
The conditions of the discharge might include payment of a substantial fine,
full co-operation with any continuing investigation, regulatory penalties
imposed by an SRO such as ceasing to do business in a market, or restitution
to the victim.
Mr Staple also called for a simplification of the financial regulatory
system. 'If the law (including its institutions) is unclear, people will
find ways round it'.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Fresh talks on the future of Ulster expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST Anglo-Irish conference since the Irish elections is expected to
take place next month, and is likely to herald the initiation of fresh talks
about the future of Northern Ireland shortly afterwards.
British ministers expect that two meetings under the Anglo-Irish conference
might be necessary to agree a way forward for the talks to start again,
after their breakdown last November.
There appears to be a consensus in London, Belfast and Dublin that the
'three-strand' approach of the last talks will not be repeated and that
there is a need for a less rigid structure. This would allow a series of
bilateral contacts between the two governments and the four main political
parties in the province.
One point on which the UK will be pressing is the prospect of change on the
Irish constitutional claim over Northern Ireland.
While not expecting the Irish to concede the claim instantly, British
ministers are looking for a change of tone. When the negotiations broke down
the Dublin government's statement that it only 'could', not 'would', hold a
referendum on changing its constitution if an overall settlement were
reached caused particular difficulties for the unionists. The new Irish
government, which took office only last week, has not indicated its stance
on this issue.
Mr Dick Spring, the new Irish foreign minister, is expected to hold an
informal meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
later this week to set dates for the first Anglo-Irish conference meetings.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Washington braced for the big bash: The five-day
extravaganza marking the US presidential inauguration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN it is not consumed by the plight of Nicaraguan peasants, National
Public Radio, the closest American broadcasting comes to the BBC, has a nice
line in gentle humour.
The other day it ran a skit in which one of its women reporters, who is
unmarried and happens to have a ticket for the inaugural ball, took calls
from really famous people, such as TV talk show hosts and the odd senator,
all begging for a date next Wednesday night.
Tickets, beds and chairs are perhaps the most important commodities in the
five-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza that is this week's presidential
inauguration. There are, quite simply, not enough of the first two to go
around and there may, when it is all over, be a distinct shortage of things
to sit on in perhaps the most important room in the country.
Free-market theorists will be disappointed to know that there is virtually
no secondary, or scalping, market in tickets for the balls, galas and parade
stands. The inaugural is one of those occasions when tickets have no retail
value, as the important thing is to be there and to be seen to be there.
The official inaugural programme is extensive; starting even before a
30ft-by-60ft fireworks representation of Bill Clinton playing the saxophone
lit up the skies over the Potomac to mark his arrival from Thomas
Jefferson's Virgina home yesterday, and ending with a White House open (but
by invitation) day on Thursday. But it is dwarfed by the unauthorised,
though lavish, events also scheduled for this week.
The terse Associated Press diary is now more than 3ft long, only the first
11 inches of which are taken up by official functions. Unofficial highlights
include an Animal Ball, at which vegetarian food will be served by
waitresses clad only in aprons and to which the wearing of furs is
prohibited, the MTV rock n'roll ball, with live music and a performance by
Mr Clinton's country music singing brother, and a ball for the homeless, to
which food contributions are required and the wearing of 'church clothes'
recommended.
On Monday night the Clintons and Gores will be attending the official gala
at a suburban sports centre but will not be the main attractions. The
monarch himself, Michael Jackson, will be singing and dancing, and so will
the queen of Hollywood, Barbra Streisand, recently energised by her
organisation of a boycott of Colorado because of its passage last November
of an anti-homosexual initiative.
There have been reports from Los Angeles that the 'stars', who expect to be
treated like royalty, are a bit miffed at the shortage of appropriate
accommodation and lack of recognition accorded to them in Washington.
There has certainly been a run on local stretch limousine rentals not seen
since the Reagans took over the town 12 years ago.
The cost of all this is impossible to estimate. The official side is
supposed to be operating on a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.1m) budget, financed by
the sale of memorabilia and by private donations, which have been solicited
(including, controversially, by Mrs Hillary Clinton's brothers, who would
have been better advised to sing back-up to Roger Clinton). As sure as it
will be cold this week, this budget will be broken.
There have naturally been complaints that tickets have been priced out of
the reach of ordinary people, also arriving in thousands. At Dollars 125 a
head an official ball ticket is cheaper than any at the Reagan and Bush
inaugurals; the problem is simply laying hands on one. It is assumed that
the whole population of Arkansas (3.7m) has them, but evidence suggests this
is not true.
In any case, there is much free entertainment. The Johnson Mountain Boys,
one of the stellar bluegrass groups, seem to be performing three times a
day. So, for aficionados of Slavic music, are the Popovich brothers.
However, anyone with a spare bedroom in Washington has discovered how many
out-of-town 'friends' they have. Every office with a view over the
Pennsylvania Avenue parade route has already ordered the paper cups and
cocktail snacks.
But one room is going to look rather different when it is all over. Most of
the members of the Bush cabinet are taking home with them the chairs they
sat in while deciding the affairs of state.
Each chair costs Dollars 1,666 and has a commemorative plaque on the back.
Some staff members chipped in to buy the chairs for their departmental
heads; the cabinet itself had a whip-round to give Mr Bush his.
Theoretically, new chairs have been ordered for the Clinton cabinet. But if
they have not arrived in time 'there's plenty of folding ones to go around,'
according to one Republican White House aide.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Squabble over jobs sours transition: Republican resignations
could lead to early chaos in the new administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the recurring sounds of the last two months has been that of
President-elect Bill Clinton saying how fully he supports outgoing President
George Bush in his handling of foreign policy challenges such as Somalia and
Iraq.
At home, however, there has been more friction between the departing
Republicans and the arriving Democrats; in the days before Mr Bush hands
over to his successor on Wednesday, relations between the two transition
teams have turned sour over the question of jobs.
A new president in the US always brings a turnover in federal staff that is
unmatched in other western democracies, but the Clinton team has irritated
the Bush officials handling the transition by asking for an unusually
sweeping and immediate set of resig-nations.
The White House has taken the Clinton request literally, and will put the
resignations of about 650 top officials, whose replacements are subject to
Senate confirmation, into effect at noon on Wednesday.
This creates the potential for chaos, as Mr Clinton has fallen behind
schedule in picking people to fill second- and third-tier jobs in his
administration, and will have no one ready to pick up the reins of
government.
Mr Kevin Moley, deputy secretary of health and human services, told the New
York Times that the resignations would make clear the Clinton team's lack of
expertise. 'That's what the American people voted for on November 3. Now the
consequences will come home to roost,' he said.
At the same time, however, the Bush administration has decided to give Mr
Clinton no help in rooting out lower-level political appointees, whose
resignations have also been asked for.
Despite Mr Clinton's early talk of including Republicans in his
administration, it is clear there are too many Democrats looking for
government jobs to keep more than a tiny handful of Bush appointees in
office.

<TEXT>
MR Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, yesterday met Israeli leaders in
Jerusalem in an attempt to remove the threat to Middle East peace talks
posed by Israel's expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, but gave little
indication of a breakthrough.
'We have discussed ideas and that is all,' he said after meeting Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the prime minister.
Israel and all the Arab parties to the peace talks want them to resume, but
Mr Rabin has refused to reverse last month's expulsions which the
Palestinians say is a condition for their return to the table.
Israel is also concerned to deflect Arab pressure for further UN action to
enforce Security Council Resolution 799 calling for the deportees' return.
The pressure has escalated since air strikes resumed on Iraq for its
non-compliance with UN resolutions.
Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, told the BBC yesterday the exiles'
two-year expulsion term could be 'shortened dramatically' if they renounced
terrorism. 'We are open to any other suggestions,' he said. But after
meeting Mr Moussa, Mr Rabin reiterated his determination to stick to the
expulsion decision.
The government argued in the Israeli High Court yesterday that reversal of
the decision would be 'a mortal blow to the security establishment'.
Meanwhile, the deportees marched towards Israeli lines to mark the beginning
of their second month stranded in tents in no-man's land. 'The UN Security
Council should be ashamed of itself,' Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, one of the
leaders of the men told them. 'How can it implement resolutions on Iraq but
silently watch Israeli terrorism?'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Malaysian parliament begins debating measures today to limit the powers
of the country's nine sultans, or hereditary rulers, writes Kieran Cooke in
Kuala Lumpur.
In what is seen as one of the most crucial political acts in Malaysia for
several years, the government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, wants
to remove constitutional provisions which give the sultans, each of whom
takes a turn as king, immunity from prosecution.
The proposed amendments include abolishing the right of the sultans to
pardon themselves and members of their families and provisions which forbid
adverse comment being made in parliament about the royalty.
While there is little doubt MPs will approve the amendments, there could be
a crisis should the sultans not give their approval to the measures. Some
have indicated they are unwilling to support the government's actions. There
are also some doubts about popular support for the moves.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, began to reshuffle his
government at the weekend in an attempt to bolster his authority following
criticism of his handling of the Ayodhya mosque crisis.
Mr Rao is dismissing 14 of his 59-member Council of Ministers in the biggest
mid-term reshuffle for more than a decade. Acting with uncharacteristic
flamboyance, he disclosed his plan on Saturday night at a banquet - at which
ministers were suddenly presented with resignation letters and asked to sign
them on the spot.
The prime minister was not expected to disclose the names of sacked
ministers until today. However, the content of the reshuffle is expected to
be considerably less dramatic than the manner in which it is being done;
senior cabinet members likely to retain their portfolios include Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister and the chief architect of India's wide-ranging
economic reform programme.
The reshuffle is not, as opposition MPs were quick to point out, being
accompanied by any policy announcements.
By late last night the prime minister had not offered any new initiatives to
heal the rifts caused by the inter-religious violence which has left at
least 1,800 dead since Hindu militants tore down the mosque in the northern
town of Ayodhya on December 6. About 600 people have died in the last two
weeks in Bombay in an upsurge of violence, which was only brought under
control by troops.
The Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu opposition whose supporters
demolished the Ayodhya mosque, said the reshuffle was merely putting 'old
wine into a new bottle'.
Indian prime ministers frequently reshuffle ministerial jobs, occasionally
to improve policy-making in a particular area but more often for party
political reasons. The ruling Congress (I) party is composed of different
regional, economic and social interest groups, with competing claims for
power which the prime minister must try to balance. An economic report
published at the weekend brought the prime minister some good news.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, forecast in a report that the
economy could grow by 4 per cent in the year to June 1993 - about 0.5
percentage points above the government's target. The central bank forecast a
2 per cent increase in agricultural output and 4-5 per cent in industry.

FT  18 JAN 93 / 'Bottom-up' style in fashion for ex-Soviet reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMISE of Mr Yegor Gaidar as leader of Russia's economic reformers, to
be replaced as Russian prime minister by the conservative Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, might suggest the Russian government's attempt to stabilise
the inflation rate has come to an end. In fact, the evidence appears to
suggest that monetary stabilisation never really began.
Apart from a small blip in the spring of last year, Russia's money supply
has been growing as fast as the rouble exchange rate has been collapsing.
The main culprit is rouble credits paid by the central bank to otherwise
bankrupt Russian enterprises, as the charts, drawn from the latest issue of
Russian Economic Trends, show.
With officials from the International Monetary Fund breathing down their
necks, Mr Gaidar and his team did manage to suppress the growth of these
credits in May and June and the monthly inflation rate fell to a low of 9
per cent in August. But the control of the reformers waned, as enterprises'
losses accumulated and the power of the industrial lobby grew. Having risen
by 36 per cent in May and June, enterprise credits rose by 33 per cent in
July alone while monthly inflation accelerated to 33 per cent in November.
What went wrong? The reformers and their western advisers have been quick to
blame the inflationary habits of the central bank. But Russia's inflation
was only a symptom, the most direct manifestation of the power struggle
between Moscow's reformers and the more reactionary forces who still control
the economy.
The reformers' strategy was to try to loosen the grip of the industrialists
by imposing bankruptcies and rising unemployment from the centre in the name
of stabilisation. But the evidence shows how successful the bureaucrats and
industrialists have been in keeping control. Industrial productivity fell by
24 per cent last year but Russian output fell by 22 per cent. So the same
number of workers produced a fifth less output at the expense of
accelerating inflation.
Russia's failed attempt at stabilisation suggests that success is possible
only if the grip of the industrial lobby is weakened. Mr Daniel Kaufman, the
World Bank mission chief in Kiev, is advising the Ukrainian government,
currently struggling with a monthly inflation rate of 50 per cent, to press
ahead with small-scale privatisation, especially of retail stores, trucks
and farmland, and remove legal barriers to new businesses. This would weaken
the power of the bureaucracy and generate alternative employment.
Reform efforts should be concentrated in those regions where the local
government is more progressive in order to provide a lead for more
conservative regions and bypass well-organised vested interests, he says.
State enterprises should be commercialised as fast as possible but
potentially profitable large enterprises should be kept afloat with limited,
transparent and time-bound subsidies tied to restructuring. Only then can
the government bring the budget deficit under control and make the shift to
the market irreversible.
Russia's reformers are also embracing this 'bottom-up' approach. The
Nizhny-Novgorod experiment in auction-based small-scale privatisation is
being tested in Tomsk, Volgograd and Moscow, while last week the government
said that 14 of Russia's 49 regions were to be included in a campaign to
sell about 500 large and medium-sized enterprises under the direction of the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm.
All of this appears to amount to a shift in the conventional wisdom away
from the academically fashionable 'stabilise first, liberalise and
restructure later' approach. As Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, Ukraine's minister for
the economy, explains: 'The lesson we have drawn from Russia's experience is
that a pure monetary approach which looks very good on paper is nearly
impossible to implement in an almost entirely monopolised economy.'

FT  18 JAN 93 / Indian banking executives quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R C MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR senior executives in India of Citibank, the US bank allegedly involved
in the Rs35bn (Pounds 782m) Bombay securities market scandal, have resigned
following scrutiny of the bank's role in the affair.
The resignations come after wide-ranging probes of Citibank and other
institutions involved in the scandal by a parliamentary committee, the
central bank, and the US Federal Reserve Board, the securities watchdog
which sent a team to Bombay last week.
The four men leaving the bank include Mr AS Thiyagarajan, who headed the
bank's Indian investment banking operations until he left Bombay late last
year. The three others also worked in investment banking, handling the
bank's trade in securities on its own account and on behalf of clients in
portfolio management schemes.
A Citibank spokesman in Bombay confirmed the four men resigned on Saturday.
He said there was no link with the Federal Reserve Board team's visit but
declined to elaborate.
The scandal, which erupted last April, has brought heavy losses to some
banks, the resignation of a cabinet minister, and the arrest of about 20
people. Foreign banks, which dominated the inter-bank securities market,
have been criticised for pioneering trading techniques which allegedly ran
foul of regulations. Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, chairman of the parliamentary
investigatory committee, accused foreign banks of initiating the fraud.
Bankers said the resignations would prompt renewed demands for the
parliamentary committee to investigate Citibank further.

   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-AIRCRAFT fire lit up the sky over Baghdad late last night.
An air raid siren to the south was the only warning of an attack on the
capital, before the guns opened up. As residents rushed indoors
anti-aircraft shells and tracers crossed the sky for 15 minutes in brilliant
yellow and red patterns.
The Rasheed Hotel in central Baghdad, where delegates to an Islamic
conference and foreign journalists are staying, was badly damaged. A crater
at least 10ft deep lay gaping in the garden and the blast ripped through the
main lobby, killing at least one person.
Fifteen people were believed injured.
'I don't believe this is happening to us again,' said one Baghdad resident
during the raid.
Earlier in the day he had been in the streets when, with drums beating,
torches burning and chants of 'Down, Bush' and 'Long Live Saddam', thousands
of Iraqis had held well-orchestrated demonstrations to mark the second
anniversary of the start of the Gulf war.
With only a few days left of Mr George Bush's presidency and Mr Saddam
firmly in power, the feeling during the marches was one of victory for the
Iraqi leader.
It is a mood the anti-aircraft batteries are likely to have changed.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Iraqis 'start dismantling police posts to obey UN demand'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRAQIS last night began dismantling six of their police posts lying
within Kuwaiti territory in belated accordance with United Nations demands,
Sheikh Nasser al-Saud, the Kuwait information minister said.
The minister, speaking during a hastily convened press conference following
news of the allied attack on Iraq, also said that Kuwait police had returned
fire at three Iraqis he described as intelligence officers who had crossed
at least 5km into Kuwait.
The Kuwait police had killed one of the men, arrested another and injured a
third who escaped back into Iraq, he added.
Sheikh Nasser did not indicate if Iraq had begun dismantling the police
posts before last night's allied raid on Iraq, but said: 'We hope that by
tomorrow they will be removed altogether.'
The six posts, which were manned by 46 Iraqi policemen, lay within what
since last November's UN border demarcation is now Kuwaiti territory.
Iraq had previously ignored a UN Security Council demand to dismantle and
evacuate the six posts by January 15.
Iraq's dismantling of the posts would amount to the country's first
acknowledgment of the UN-demarcated border.
This was drawn up by a special UN commission under the terms of Gulf war
ceasefire resolution 687.
Baghdad has previously rejected the border commission's findings, which
moved the frontier north into what had become accepted as Iraqi territory,
embracing five Iraqi oilfields and naval installations at Iraq's Umm Qasr
port.
Sheikh Nasser said that earlier yesterday morning, three Iraqis dressed in
civilian clothing had fired at Kuwaiti police south of the demilitarised
zone which extends 5km into Kuwaiti territory. The Iraqis, he said, were
'intelligence officers coming in to see positions taken by the Kuwaiti
forces'.
Since Kuwait's forces were put on high alert earlier this week, a line of
tanks has dug in just south of the demilitarised zone. Sheikh Nasser said
that the detained Iraqi had identified himself as 'a military person with a
military rank'.
Sheikh Nasser said he was confident Kuwait had nothing to fear from any
potential Iraqi retaliation against the Gulf state after last night's raid
on Iraq and, clearly conscious of charges that the Kuwait government was
unprepared for the 1990 invasion, added: 'All necessary precautions have
been taken.'
However, the minister said that he believed the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait
Observer Mission should be reinforced from its present level of 249 unarmed
officers.
Sheikh Nasser expressed 'disgust' at President Saddam Hussein's 1 1/2 -hour
speech earlier in the day.
He called on the Iraqi people to overthrow their leader. 'We hope the Iraqi
people will come to their senses and take things into their own hands,' he
said.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Attack widens target range: Cheney argues for keeping up
sanctions, denying Saddam the ability to rebuild his forces

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's decision yesterday to launch a missile strike
against an Iraqi nuclear facility moves the allied response to President
Saddam Hussein's challenges a notch higher.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, warned yesterday that US concern
about Iraq's intentions was growing. The Tomahawk missile launch made clear
the riposte had also moved a notch higher.
Over the last few weeks Mr Saddam has challenged the UN, particularly the
US, Britain and France, on different fronts: bomb attacks on UN relief
lorries in Kurdistan, threatening missile and aircraft movements in the two
no-fly zones, raids across the Kuwaiti border, and obstructions to movement
of UN inspectors charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons capability.
Until yesterday, only the challenges in the no-fly zones had drawn a
military response. Allied fighters shot down an Iraqi Mig aircraft violating
the southern zone late last month; on Wednesday, they bombed missile and
radar sites in the zone. Yesterday they shot down another Mig in the
northern zone, and fired a missile at radar locked on to allied aircraft.
Yesterday's Tomahawk attack extends the range of targets beyond the no-fly
zones.
Pentagon doctrine has generally held that if you are to use military force
against an opponent, you should use it overwhelmingly. Last Wednesday's air
raid has strengthened the hand of those who question the effectiveness of
such limited attacks.
For several days some officers have argued for an assault over several days,
targeting troops, air defence sites and nuclear plants. The coalition seems
anxious to keep some proportion between Mr Saddam's challenges to UN
resolutions and the punishment. By attacking a nuclear factory, the
coalition kept a direct link to the obstruction of UN inspection flights.
Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, suggested the coalition had little
prospect of shaping Mr Saddam's behaviour by its military actions, but
argued that the important aim was to maintain sanctions against the Iraqi
leader, preventing him rebuilding his military forces.
Philip Stephens, Political Editor, adds: The UK government last night
offered unequivocal backing for the latest air strike against Iraq,
insisting the action was fully underpinned by UN resolutions. But amid
growing concern that Mr Saddam is determined to step up his confrontation
with the west, it was privately acknowledged in Whitehall that the coalition
against him faces important constraints.
Downing Street stressed that the facility attacked was one of those on the
inspection list of the UN Special Commission.
The missiles were fired only after personal consultations between Mr Bush
and other western leaders, and with the UN weapons inspectorate team.
Diplomatic contacts had been concerted with Arab governments to reassure
them of the coalition's intentions. Officials conceded that military
advisers would have preferred a severer assault, directed at Iraq's military
capacity, especially its air defences.
But the Bush administration's anxiety not to risk US aircrews and the
concern of its partners, including Britain, not to fall outside the UN
resolutions, argued for a limited strike.
Officials denied a split with Washington over the timing and scale of the
latest operation. But Mr Major is keen to keep the unity which has given him
all-party backing at Westminster for military enforcement of UN resolutions.
A dozen or so Labour MPs oppose military action, but the proportionate
nature of the strikes so far has ensured Mr Major the support of both the
Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders.

<TEXT>
MR AMR MOUSSA, Egyptian foreign minister, yesterday met Israeli leaders in
Jerusalem in an attempt to remove the threat to Middle East peace talks
posed by Israel's expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, but gave little
indication of a breakthrough.
'We have discussed ideas and that is all,' he said after meeting Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the prime minister.
Israel and all the Arab parties to the peace talks want them to resume, but
Mr Rabin has so far refused to reverse last month's expulsions which the
Palestinians say is a condition for their return to the table.
Israel is also concerned to deflect Arab pressure for further UN action to
enforce Security Council Resolution 799 calling for the return of the
deportees, which has escalated since US-led air strikes resumed on Iraq for
its non-compliance with UN resolutions.
Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, told the BBC yesterday the exiles'
two-year expulsion term could be 'shortened dramatically' if they renounced
terrorism. 'We are open to any other suggestions,' he said. But after
meeting Mr Moussa, Mr Rabin reiterated his determination to stick to the
expulsion decision.
The government argued in the Israeli High Court yesterday that reversal of
the decision would be 'a mortal blow to the security establishment'.

FT  18 JAN 93 / With cries of 'Down, Bush', Baghdad calls a celebration

   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH drums beating, torches burning and chants of 'Down, Bush' and 'Long
Live Saddam', thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad yesterday
in well-orchestrated demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the
start of the Gulf War.
One of those on the march to the United Nations Development Programme
building, Mr Starred Husseini, 30, who said he had fought in the war,
insisted the anniversary was a cause for celebration in view of the
impressive reconstruction programme carried out by Iraq.
'The people are happy. They are proud they have been successful in
rebuilding Iraq. We have survived everything thrown at us,' he said.
At 8am, all traffic in Baghdad came to a standstill for five minutes in
memory of the war dead, and schools and universities received lectures on
the US-led military 'aggression' against Iraq.
Iraqi newspapers appeared with special celebratory issues. Carrying large
pictures of their leader and defiant headlines such as 'All allegiance to
Saddam Hussein, Hero of the Mother of All Battles' and 'The aggressors have
been defeated'.
They all ran President Saddam's speech to the nation on the first day of the
war, along with pictures and articles on the reconstruction. The newspaper
Al Thawra said in its editorial that 'Iraqis are launching their
counter-attack with a massive drive to reconstruct, in record time, all
things damaged by the aggressors.'
The reconstruction theme was also played up by government ministries, which
announced the opening of new industrial and public service projects. A
fertiliser plant, new electricity generators and super-grid stations, a
government foodstuffs sales department, an ammonia plant and an air
conditioner factory were all inaugurated by various officials yesterday.
Mr Asama Abdul Razaq al Hitti, oil minister, announced oil production would
reach 3m barrels a day by the end of this year due to the finding of new
reserves and plans to drill 5,000-10,000 new oil wells. In 1989, output was
2.79m b/d. Iraq was ready to begin exporting oil with renewed vigour as soon
as the embargo was lifted, the minister added.
With only a few days left of Mr George Bush's presidency and President
Saddam firmly in power, the atmosphere was one of victory for the Iraqi
leader. Many Iraqis see the current crisis between the western allies and
Iraq as a last-ditch attempt by Mr Bush to finish work left unfinished
during the Gulf War, and the celebrations are likely to last until Mr Bill
Clinton's inauguration on Wednesday.
Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, said Iraq 'would like to see the
personal vendetta policy come to an end. That will be enough to create an
objective for a special atmosphere to discuss all the questions between the
two sides.' He called on the incoming US administration to 'review Iraq's
situation in a non-personal manner.'

FT  18 JAN 93 / Kuwait toughens funds law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S National Assembly is tomorrow expected to approve a law to enhance
public scrutiny of the Gulf state's overseas investments and considerably
toughen the punishment for individuals found guilty of misusing public
funds.
The law would be the strongest yet promoted by the 60-seat assembly, which
was elected in last October's general elections, and a clear signal by the
opposition-dominated parliament of its determination to force more open
accountability for Kuwait's remaining overseas wealth.
The parliament's move follows widespread concern in the Gulf state following
the revelations last year of billions of dollars of losses from the Spanish
holdings of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office and evidence of
possible improprieties.
The bill is due for a second reading during tomorrow's weekly sitting of the
assembly but would become law only after promulgation by the emir, Sheikh
Jaber al-Sabah.
The legislation would require all state companies, and those in which the
Kuwait government holds a stake of at least 25 per cent, to report to the
government's auditors all changes in investments within as little as 10 days
of the transaction.
The auditors would also be required to report on all state investment
activities to the assembly every six months.
Delay in reporting investments would be liable to prosecution, while anyone
found guilty of misusing public funds would face a sentence of life
imprisonment, up from a previous maximum of 10 years.
The move, which diplomats in Kuwait City expect to win the backing of the
emir himself, is aimed at addressing a popular feeling in Kuwait that the
country's previously substantial overseas investments have been managed with
too much secrecy and too little accountability.
Before the Gulf war, the KIO handled a portfolio worth an estimated Dollars
100bn (Pounds 65.7bn), though this is believed to have fallen to nearer
Dollars 30bn or less after sales and drawings to help pay for Kuwait's
substantial post-war costs.
Both the government, through the prosecutor-general, and the assembly,
through its own parliamentary committee, are investigating the KIO's Spanish
and other investments.
It remains unclear whether the proposed law would permit retroactive
prosecution for any individuals found to have been guilty of misuse or
misappropriation of the KIO's funds, the bulk of which were financed out of
a portion of Kuwait's oil revenues.
Neither is it clear whether the law would apply to two officials of the
Kuwait Oil Tanker Company who were charged earlier this month with
conducting illegal transactions.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Warning on E German pay rates: Federation of industry chief
appeals for renegotiation of current contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE most important single achievement of the German government's planned
'solidarity pact' with unions, employers and the opposition should be the
renegotiation of current wage contracts in east Germany, according to the
German federation of industry (BDI).
Mr Tyll Necker, the federation's president, said the second key element
should be the demonstration by all levels of government of a genuine
capacity to cut spending, in order to finance the burden of transfers to the
eastern economy.
He maintained in an interview that neither of those elements was assured,
although Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has expressed his
determination to complete negotiations on all fronts by the end of the
month.
Mr Necker backed the Bundesbank's maintenance of high interest rates in
order to keep pressure on both government and trade unions to accept
restraint in public spending and wages, in spite of the cost to industry.
Exporters, in particular, were feeling pressure from the resulting
revaluation of the D-Mark, he said.
However, Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Germany's
largest industrial corporation, criticised the Bundesbank on Saturday for
maintaining its harsh monetary policy too long. He said it was a
'dangerously wrong conclusion' for both the domestic and international
economy.
Mr Necker warned that failure to postpone the 26 per cent pay rise due for
east German engineering workers on April 1, as part of their long-term wage
equalisation deal with western workers, would lead to a 'catastrophic
situation' for the rest of east German manufacturing industry.
Talks which opened last week between IG-Metall, the engineering workers'
union, and employers in eastern Germany produced no progress in
renegotiating the deal.
As for a comprehensive government savings package, under negotiation again
last night between Mr Kohl and his colleagues in the government coalition,
Mr Necker said it was important to create a 'public awareness' of the need
for drastic savings in order to pay for the cost of German unification.
Mr Kohl's talks are aimed at producing a firm proposal on savings in
government spending, both in the current year and in the medium-term,
totalling about DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn). Reports over the weekend confirmed
that substantial cuts in social spending - totalling as much as DM7bn - were
high on the agenda.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Danish centrists offer hope for SDP leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the leader of Denmark's opposition Social
Democratic party, moved closer yesterday to becoming prime minister of
Denmark when a pivotal centrist party said it would probably back him.
The small Radical Liberal party, holding the balance of power in parliament,
said after an all-day meeting it would support him if inter-party talks on a
government programme were successful.
'We are now concentrating on creating the best possible government programme
and if this is successful it would be natural that Rasmussen becomes prime
minister,' Radical Liberal leader Marianne Jelved said after the party
meeting in the town of Nyborg.
Mr Rasmussen will resume talks today, seeking either a minority SDP
government or a coalition of the SDP and the Radical Liberals.
Mr Schluter, prime minister since 1982, resigned last Thursday when a
judicial inquiry found that he had misled the Folketing (parliament) in 1989
over the so-called 'Tamilgate' scandal, in which Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, the
former minister of justice, illegally ordered civil servants to delay
issuing entry visas to the wives and children of Tamil refugees from Sri
Lanka.
There appears to be majority support among the parties in the Folketing for
impeachment proceedings against Mr Ninn-Hansen. If such proceedings are
instituted it will be for the first time since 1910.
An impeachment trial is conducted by the 15 judges of the High Court, who
sit together with 15 persons appointed by the Folketing, none of whom may be
MPs.
Tamilgate has not led to an increase in the popularity of the SDP, according
to opinion polls. A poll published in Jyllands Posten yesterday showed the
SDP sliding by four points to 33.4 per cent from 37.4 per cent in the 1990
election. The chief beneficiary of the scandal, which has seriously damaged
the Conservative party, is the Liberal party of Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
foreign minister, which went ahead to 23.9 per cent compared with 15.8 per
cent in the last election.
The possibility of an SDP government has been accepted with equanimity by
the financial markets.
One reason is that the party's economic policy spokesman, Mr Mogens
Lykkteft, has said that an SDP government would continue to pursue tight
public spending policies and would maintain the fixed exchange rate policy
through continued participation in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Among the tasks for a new prime minister is running the rotating European
Community presidency, in Copenhagen's hands since January 1.
Denmark also faces a crucial second referendum in late April or May on the
landmark Maastricht treaty on European economic and political union, after
Danes said No in a first vote last June.
Mr Rasmussen is a staunch supporter of a revised Maastricht deal exempting
Danes from the treaty's long-term aims for a common currency and joint
defence policies.
Danish news media predicted that if the government programme was accepted by
a majority Mr Rasmussen could replace Mr Schluter by the middle of this
week.

A venture capital fund, with private investments and a Dollars 3.5m (Pounds

Development, is being established in Ukraine, writes Chrystia Freeland in
Kiev.
Mr George Yurchyshyn, a former senior vice president of the Bank of Boston
who is now based in Kiev as director of the fund, is optimistic the fund
will reach its target of Dollars 10m within the next few months and says
there may be enough investor interest to establish a second fund. He expects
the fund to give a return on investments within seven to 10 years.
The fund will make small investments in a variety of private businesses with
proven track records, rather than in start-up projects. All its investments
are made in hard currency and Ukrainian foreign investment law allows the
fund to convert coupon profits back into dollars.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Trying to sell Kiev reform: Opposition to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Ukrainian officials have spent the past week embroiled in
international negotiations over oil, foreign debt and nuclear weapons,
opposition to market-oriented reform proposals has begun to emerge.
Deputy prime minister Viktor Pynzenyk is now rewriting his reform programme
after conservatives in the cabinet gave his draft proposals a frosty
reception while he was away in Brussels this month seeking European
Community aid. At the same time, hardline ex-Communists in parliament are
rumoured to be organising an attempt to oust the reformist chairman of
parliament, Mr Ivan Pliushch.
Mr Pynzenyk's latest draft is scheduled to come before the full cabinet for
approval this week before being presented to parliament.
The programme plans to cut inflation from over 50 per cent a month now to 3
or 4 per cent a month by the end of the year. To do that, Mr Pynzenyk wants
to bring the budget deficit down to 6 per cent of gross domestic product
this year, from 1992's run-away deficit of 36 per cent of GDP.
Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma insists he remained committed to this reformist
course. 'I cannot imagine doing anything other than continuing with the
reform programme,' he said. 'There is no other path.'
But Mr Kuchma said the reforms had to be sold carefully. Cuts in social
welfare spending, which are envisaged as part of the effort to balance the
budget, would go ahead. But reformers must speak of 'restructuring' the
state health care, not cutting it.
'We cannot write that we will spend less on health, so we should call it
restructuring, ' Mr Kuchma said. 'It is the same thing but expressed in a
different way. This does not mean that we are backing down from the
programme.'
Mr Kuchma has asked Mr Pynzenyk to present the reforms in a politically
palatable form.
Yet his fears about the political acceptability of the proposals have cast
doubt among western observers and Ukrainian economists on his willingness to
take the tough decisions that will be needed to control inflation.
Since coming to office in October, Mr Kuchma has failed to rein in credit
emission. Central bank officials say that in the last two months of 1992
there was a net emission of Rbs100bn, bringing the monthly inflation rate to
50 per cent in December. Prices rose by 2,500 per cent over the whole year.
Ukraine's coupon is one of the few currencies in the world to have
depreciated against the Russian rouble since Ukraine left the rouble zone in
November.
When the government has taken tough decisions, it has tended to bow to
pressure and watered down its actions.
Its decision to cut food subsidies and raise state prices, which came into
effect on December 25, caused many food prices to rise by 300 per cent
overnight. But when several thousand of workers from the elite Arsenal arms
factory marched to the parliament to protest, the government softened the
blow by doubling the minimum wage.
The government has made some progress in its bid to weaken the power of the
state bureaucracy by privatising the agriculture sector. By giving plots of
land to its private citizens it has created 13m private smallholders and
production rose by 50 per cent last year. 'These garden plots are the main
source of food for the cities,' says Mr Pynzenyk.
Mr Pynzenyk says progress in microeconomic reforms, including small-scale
privatisation in agriculture and the retail sector, are the key to the
programme's success: 'We are opposed to the view that we should have
stabilisation first and then structural reform,' he says.
Mr Daniel Kaufmann, chief of the World Bank mission to Ukraine, has urged
Kiev's reformers to speed ahead with structural reforms. 'Financial
macro-economic stability cannot be attained without reform at the
micro-level, particularly enterprise reform and privatisation in industry
and agriculture,' he says.
Western financial support for Ukrainian reforms does not appear imminent,
especially because of US worries over Ukraine's hesitation to surrender its
nuclear weapons.
While Mr Kuchma does not expect American aid to make things better, he does
not think the US can make things worse. 'America is threatening us over the
nuclear weapons,' he says. 'They say that if we do not give them up they
will take away their aid. But when they say this, I look around and I say to
them, where is this aid?'

BELGIUM'S prime minister, European commissioner and central bank governor
say they favour monetary union with fewer European Community states if the
Maastricht treaty is not ratified by all 12 members, Reuter reports from
Antwerp.
'In order to restore international political stability, it is important all
countries ratify Maastricht. If some cannot do this, the others must carry
on alone,' Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Saturday at a public debate.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, due to take over the EC's rotating
six-month presidency in July, agreed.
'One of the biggest challenges of the Belgian EC presidency will be whether
or not we manage to have all 12 countries ratify Maastricht or not,' he
said.
'But whatever the legal possibilities of the treaty are, the political will
should be there to go ahead with less than 12.'

REFORM of Italy's unwieldy electoral system will be accelerated following an
historic decision by the constitutional court over the weekend.
On Saturday the court sanctioned 10 referendums on various aspects of
reforming the state. The most important concerns the proposed abolition of
the 45-year-old system of proportional representation for electing the
senate and local councils in favour of a first-past-the-post system.
The main drawback of Italy's existing electoral system is the way it
encourages the fragmentation of parties and produces unstable coalition
governments.
The referendums must now be held between April 18 and June 13. They can be
postponed only if parliament agrees in the meantime legislation similar in
spirit to that contained in the 10 proposals. In any event, new legislation
changing the electoral system is almost certain in the first half of the
year.
A 60-strong commission of the two houses of parliament has been discussing
institutional reform, especially changes in the electoral system, since
October. But it has been bogged down by a lack of consensus among the main
parties. The ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists in particular have
opposed the removal of proportional representation.
Political commentators said yesterday that unless the parties made an effort
to achieve a consensus, parliament would be unable to agree on new
legislation in time to head off the referendums. They also predicted that
the referendums would be easily carried. The last referendum, held in June
1991 to abolish the system of multi-preference votes, was overwhelmingly
endorsed.
'Italians finally have in their hands the means to build a new republic,'
said a jubilant Mr Mario Segni, the Christian Democrat leader of the
movement backing reform of the electoral system via referendum. Mr Segni has
been co-opted onto the joint parliamentary institutional reform commission
and will now becomes a key member.
The issue of the referendum is also likely to affect the nature of new
alliances as the Christian Democrats struggle to renew themselves and the
Socialists seek to stay together after the eclipse of Mr Bettino Craxi,
their leader, in the Milan corruption scandal. Both party leaderships have
been wary of the referendum movement and have been anxious to control change
through parliament.
Under the new system proposed for elections to the Senate, 238 seats would
be elected by a first-past-the-post system and 77 would still be voted in by
the existing system of proportional representation. Mr Segni hopes a similar
approach could be agreed for the chamber of deputies.

THE Yugoslav army re-joined the war in Bosnia at the weekend, shelling
Moslem forces in Bosnia after they had fired across the border into Serbia,
writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
It was the first time the army has acknowledged involvement since May 19
when Bosnia formally withdrew from the republic.
The artillery exchange coincided with fierce clashes around Skelani, a
village on the Bosnia-Serbia frontier.
Peace talks are due to resume in Geneva this week.
A UN relief convoy finally arrived yesterday at the besieged Moslem enclave
of Zepa, where inhabitants are reported to be dying from starvation and
cold, Reuter adds.

FT  18 JAN 93 / France raises tobacco tax
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOBACCO taxes in France rise by 15 per cent today as part of the
government's anti-smoking drive, but the move has prompted a fresh round of
price cutting among cigarette companies.
RJ Reynolds, the US tobacco group, is to cut the retail price of its Winston
brand in France by nearly 16 per cent to FFr10 (Pounds 1.21) for a packet of
20, matching the price for blond Gauloises made by Seita, the state-owned
tobacco group.
While cigarette companies are free to set their own prices the move risks
undermining government attempts to curb smoking, following lax application
of a recent law to ban smoking in public buildings. A second tobacco tax
rise, of 15 per cent, is due on May 24.
Other brands, including Seita-owned ones, are to absorb some of the
increases in their profit margins. Blonde Gauloises, for example, will go up
by only 9 per cent, although higher-tar dark Gauloises will rise by 17 per
cent. Philip Morris, another US tobacco group, has said it will increase its
prices by an average 9.5 per cent.
RJ Reynolds said it was attempting to close the price gap between its
premium brands and cheaper French competition rather than trying to spark a
price war.

FT  18 JAN 93 / The European Market: Single market puts drugs on roundabout
 -Parallel trade and distortion in the Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's single market has generated some curious trade
distortions, none more so than one in the drugs industry. The requirement
for the free movement of goods has led to asituation in which UK-produced
medicines, for example, are exported from the UK to Greece and imported back
to Britain by wholesalers making money through the drugs' peculiar journey.
The reason for parallel trade, as the practice is known, is that drug prices
vary widely in EC member states. Drugs in France are, for example, nearly
half the price of those in the UK, according to the German federation of
pharmacists.
Parallel trade works as follows: medicines originating in countries where
prices are high, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, are exported
to EC states, including those where prices are low, such as France and
Greece. Wholesalers in the low-price countries then buy the medicines at the
prevailing low prices and reimport them into the originating countries to
compete with higher-priced local brands.
Price differences between EC states are not unusual. For example, European
car manufacturers commonly set different prices for similar vehicles in
different countries.
But whereas automotive makers are responsible for setting vehicle prices
throughout the EC, pharmaceuticals groups have little control over prices.
These are set by national governments. Some, with strong indigenous drugs
industries, have an interest in setting high prices, while others, anxious
to control health-care costs, set lower prices.
Efforts by the European Commission to harmonise drug prices have been
abandoned for the moment, admitted Sir Leon Brittan, Commission
vice-president formerly responsible for competition, last month.
Widespread pharmaceutical price regulation together with free movement of
goods, have, in effect, created distortion of trade. The situation can be
exacerbated by exchange rate fluctuations.
The pharmaceutical industry hates parallel importing because its producers
lose revenue. 'It's really annoying. Middle-men who contribute nothing to
the health-care system are making money, which is lost to the
pharmaceuticals sector,' says Mr Hakan Astrom, chief executive of Kabi
Pharmacia, the Swedish drugs group.
The danger of such trade, according to the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry, is clear. Although the public has an interest in
cheap medicines, it also has an interest in the ability of the drugs
industry to create innovative products.
The public is clamouring for treatments for currently incurable diseases
such as Aids and Alzheimer's. The trade could inflict serious damage on
research-based pharmaceuticals companies, inhibiting their ability to invest
in new drugs, the ABPI argues.
What is the scale of the problem? The drugs targeted by parallel importers
are those with international prices that differ by more than 20 per cent,
according to Mr Paul Balcombe, chairman of Spectrum group, the London-based
drug importers. He estimates about 120 products are parallel-imported by his
company into the UK. There are about 3,000 products on the market.
Six of the world's seven top-traded drugs were parallel traded in the EC,
according to a recent report* for the UK-based Institute of Economic
Affairs: Glaxo's anti-ulcerant Zantac, Bristol-Myers Squibb's hypertension
treatment Capoten, SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcerant Tagamet, ICI's
hypertension medicine Tenormin, Ciba-Geigy's angina product Voltaren, and
Bayer's hypertension drug Adalat.
As much as 30 per cent of UK sales of Zantac, Glaxo's best-selling drug, is
reimported, says Mr Martyn Postle, consultant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. He
reckons parallel trade is a big problem in the Netherlands and is becoming a
problem in Germany.
The consequence is that sales of parallel-imported medicines in 1990 were
between Pounds 250m and Pounds 305m, according to the Institute of Economic
Affairs report. This suggests the problem is small, representing only 2 per
cent of the EC's prescription sales.
The industry's fear is that parallel trade in medicines could increase,
leading to a significant collapse in revenues. The Danish government has
actively encouraged parallel trade over the last two years, for example.
However, although regulations designed to remove impediments to parallel
trade were implemented on January 1 this year, its long-term future is
uncertain.
In the short term, UK and Italian parallel importers were badly hit by the
devaluation of sterling, which wiped out nearly 15 per cent of their gross
margin. Mr Balcombe at Spectrum believes some will have to cease trading.
In the longer term, Mr Balcombe concedes the drugs groups may have found an
effective strategy to counter parallel trade. Although pharmaceutical
companies are incapable of converging prices for existing prices, they have
proved increasingly adept at harmonising prices on new drugs. Glaxo, for
example, has negotiated, with some difficulty, a common price throughout the
EC for its new potential blockbuster migraine treatment Imigran.
Mr Balcombe reckons that other drugs groups will follow Glaxo's example,
with the result that parallel trade - in pharmaceuticals at least - will
fade and die, ending one of the quirkier consequences of the single market.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Chancellor damps hopes of interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chan-cellor, yesterday signalled a cautious approach
to further UK interest rate cuts by stressing that the government faced a
difficult task keeping inflation in its target range.
Appearing on BBC Television's 'Breakfast with Frost' programme, the
chancellor said there were 'many encouraging signs' that the economy was
improving. He also insisted there was 'very little room for manoeuvre' if
the government was to keep to its target of holding underlying inflation
between 1 and 4 per cent over the life of this parliament.
These remarks in a wide-ranging but soft-centred interview with Sir David
Frost suggested the chancellor was in no hurry to approve a further cut in
bank base rates from 7 per cent. This follows speculation in financial
markets last week that interest rate cuts were imminent.
His comments came as officials confirmed that Mr John Major has set up a
cabinet committee to suggest new schemes to tackle rising unemployment. With
the jobless total set to rise above 3m over the next few months, the prime
minister is anxious to show that the government is minimising unemployment's
damaging impact on confidence.
The Treasury has so far resisted calls from other Whitehall departments for
a large-scale jobs programme in the Budget on March 16.
A report from Full Employment UK, a policy consultancy, to be presented to
the prime minister this week, estimates it would cost over Pounds 630m to
operate an obligatory scheme to take 400,000 long-term unemployed off the
dole queue.
Mr Lamont reaffirmed that the government aimed to bring underlying
inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to between zero and 2
per cent by the end of this parliament. He made clear that this would not be
easy.
Official figures issued last Friday showed the underlying inflation rate
crept up to 3.7 per cent last month from 3.6 per cent in November. Speaking
of the 1 to 4 per cent target range, the chancellor said: 'It sounds a
rather generous target, but it isn't. It is very tough by the standards of
the past.'
Mr Lamont said the impact on inflation of sterling's depreciation since
leaving the European exchange rate mechanism had been less than feared. But
it was 'early days yet' and the lower than expected boost to prices was
probably because the disinflationary forces in the economy had been so
strong before the September 16 currency crisis.
The chancellor denied that the pound's departure from the ERM had left the
government's anti-inflation strategy in tatters. He admitted, though, that
the sterling crisis had acted as a 'shattering blow to confidence'.
He stressed that the floating of sterling had also created opportunities;
the government had been able to cut interest rates while conditions had
improved for exporters. But he said currency depreciation could 'never' be
the answer to Britain's economic problems. 'It is in the long term the road
to ruin,' he said. The right way to improve performance was to become
competitive.
A welter of economic data this week should give a clearer idea of how far
Britain's economy has recovered since departure from the ERM and the
adoption in November of policies to encourage growth. The British Chambers
of Commerce quarterly business survey, on Thursday, is expected to confirm
the picture of greater optimism conveyed by smaller business surveys and
reports of high turnover in the winter sales.
Mr Lamont agreed with Sir David that growth in Britain 'could be better'
this year than the 1 per cent forecast in the Autumn Statement. Although he
insisted he was sticking to his forecast of 'around 1 per cent growth', Mr
Lamont said he expected activity would accelerate to a higher growth rate in
the second half of this year and to a faster rate next year.
'Obviously, one has to be cautious before ringing the bell and saying the
recession is over,' he said. But there were 'good trends' in retail sales,
car sales and production.

FT  18 JAN 93 / Major may face MPs' demand to divert cash into coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL proposals for the government to assume direct responsibility for
financing the decommissioning of ageing atomic power stations while
diverting some funds to the coal industry are contained in the draft of a
report by an influential committee of backbench MPs.
The eagerly-awaited chairman's draft report - sent to MPs on the trade and
industry select committee this weekend - calls for the government to take
over from Nuclear Electric more than Pounds 8bn of liabilities relating to
future decommissioning costs.
In return, the state-owned utility would stop receiving the sums raised from
the nuclear levy, a charge designed to cover these liabilities which will be
paid by all electricity consumers until 1998.
The draft coincides with strains within the cabinet on how to rescue some of
the 31 pits threatened with closure without compromising the government's
long-standing opposition to state intervention to prop up ailing industries.
Some senior cabinet members - backed by the Treasury - are fiercely opposed
to suggestions from the Department of Trade and Industry that a new levy or
an overt subsidy might be introduced to keep open loss-making pits for
several years.
They see the issue as a crucial test of whether Mr John Major is ready to
stick by free-market principles which guided Conservative policy during the
1980s.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, underlined at a
cabinet committee meeting last week his opposition to anything beyond a
strictly limited one-off payment to the coal industry. His stance is backed
by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, and by Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary.
The MPs' draft report says the bulk of the money raised by the nuclear levy
would continue to be set aside by the government for nuclear
decommissioning. But a portion would be channelled into coal to help finance
the 'greening' of the industry and to provide a lifeline for currently
unprofitable pits.
The proposals are thought to be driven in part by the assumption that actual
decommissioning costs will be less than previously supposed. Money no longer
likely to be needed for this could therefore be earmarked for coal without
asking electricity consumers to pay more to underwrite the subsidy.
It remains to be seen how Tory MPs on the committee - who include Sir
Cranley Onslow, a former 1922 committee chairman, and Mr Michael Clark,
former chairman of the energy select committee - will react to the draft
report when the cross-party body meets to discuss it line-by-line tomorrow.
Tory committee members indicated yesterday that while disagreement was
likely on certain specific details, there was general agreement that the
market for domestic coal must be expanded. They expressed doubt that
anyone's reservations would be strong enough to insist upon tabling a
minority report.
Other recommendations are thought to include: postponing liberalisation of
the regional electricity market; changing arrangements enabling France to
supply up to 6 per cent of electricity sold in England and Wales; and
stopping the switch to oil-based fuel for power stations.
The report is also believed to advocate establishing an energy commission to
oversee energy markets. The DTI is known to have played down the idea of
diverting part of the nuclear levy to other purposes such as subsidising
cleaner coal technology.

FT  18 JAN 93 / US cruise missile attack on Iraqi nuclear factory: Three
killed and hotel hit, claims Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, JAMES WHITTINGTON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US last night launched a further attack on Iraqi military installations,
firing cruise missiles from naval vessels in the Gulf at a nuclear
components plant on the outskirts of Baghdad, the capital.
The White House, which did not rule out further attacks, said the plant made
components for Iraq's nuclear enrichment programme.
The Iraqis said at least three people were killed, including two women
receptionists at Baghdad's Rasheed hotel, which was badly damaged during the
raid. They said 31 people were injured at the hotel, 11 of them Islamic
scholars attending a conference.
Iraq claimed the hotel, which houses many foreign journalists, was hit by a
US missile, but Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said it
might have been struck by falling Iraqi anti-aircraft shells.
Pentagon officials said warships unleashed about 40 Tomahawk missiles at the
targeted factory. Iraqi officials later took journalists to the plant to
show them it had been reduced to rubble, but said there were no casualties.
'We were expecting the strike. We only had a few people around at night,'
the plant director said, adding: 'It was progressive bombing, building after
building.'
Iraqi officials said the plant was a civilian engineering one, specialising
in design and fabrication of moulds for metal casting. Asked if his plant
had been engaged in any nuclear activity, the director said: 'We were very,
very far away from this field.'
The attack, on the second anniversary of the start of the Gulf War, came
after a weekend of increasing tension between Iraq and the US-led allies.
Earlier yesterday Washington said one of its jets shot down an Iraqi MiG 23
in the northern no-fly zone and another US aircraft attacked a radar
station. Iraq claimed the MiG was south of the zone and was hit while taking
off.
In a further clash, Kuwaiti border police killed an Iraqi infiltrator who
crossed into Kuwait territory. Another infiltrator was captured, but a third
escaped back into Iraq.
In a sign that Baghdad was backing down, Kuwait disclosed later that Iraq
had begun to dismantle six of its border posts inside what is now Kuwaiti
territory in compliance with United Nations demands.
But Iraq continued to place conditions on flights into the country by UN
weapons inspectors and the UN last night rejected these conditions.
President-elect Bill Clinton said he fully supported the cruise missile
attack sanctioned by the outgoing administration of President George Bush.
Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's 'continuing provocation has been met by
appropriate and forceful response', Mr Clinton said.
Voicing Britain's support, Mr John Major said the Iraqi leader had been
'courting trouble - he has had trouble'.
Mr Fitzwater said that the latest US attack was justified under UN
resolutions seeking to curb Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He said the
factory, 13 miles from the centre of Baghdad, made components for Iraq's
nuclear enrichment programme, and, in particular, electromagnetic isotope
separators.
He would not specify whether the allies had other targets in their sights
for future strikes, but gave a day-by-day catalogue of Iraq's recent
infringements of UN requirements, saying: 'The goal of this operation is to
seek compliance with UN resolutions. We don't have that yet.'
As the coalition geared up for military action yesterday, US defence
officials appeared keen to launch a heavier and more sustained assault than
last Wednesday's limited raid on Iraqi air defences in the southern no-fly
zone, which was set up to protect the Shia marsh Arabs.
Although the Bush administration insists last week's raid was militarily and
politically successful, it failed to destroy some of the targeted
anti-aircraft missile batteries.
But a strike on the suburbs of Baghdad itself, with consequent risk to
civilian lives, came as a surprise.
An Iraqi hospital doctor said three people were killed during the air raid.
The Iraqi agency news agency INA said a number of 'civilian, tourist and
cultural targets' in Baghdad were hit.
Britain's backing for renewed military strikes was underlined by Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, who accused Mr Saddam of being as
'provocative as possible against the United Nations'.
Downing Street stressed Mr Major's firm backing for the missile strike,
adding that it had been undertaken after full consultations between the
allies and with the United Nations. Officials denied suggestions that Mr
Major had held back an earlier US strike.
Iraq yesterday claimed it was now willing to provide for the safety of UN
aircraft flying in teams from Bahrain if the UN guaranteed the suspension of
allied aircraft operations in the southern no-fly zone during such flights.
But in New York, Mr Tim Trevan, spokesman of the UN special commission in
charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said: 'This is a
condition or a guarantee which the special commission simply is not in a
position to give. So, in these circumstances, the special commission is
still not in a position to fly its aircraft.'
Speaking before yesterday's attack, Mr Fitzwater accused Iraq of opening
fire with anti-aircraft artillery and missiles on coalition aircraft, and of
sending aircraft into the northern no-fly zone.
In a speech yesterday, Mr Saddam underlined Iraq's determination to resist
the no-fly zones. He also attacked Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family and
called on Kuwaitis to remove their rulers who had 'linked their destiny to
the interests of foreign forces'.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charge to give Dow Chemical loss
for year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, yesterday warned of a
disappointing fourth quarter and unveiled a Dollars 430m pre-tax charge
against 1992 earnings.
The charges are to cover restructuring moves, including job cuts and plant
closures.
Mr Enrique Falla, Dow executive vice president, said: 'Business conditions
in basic chemicals and plastics continue to remain disappointing,
particularly in Europe where margins are negative.'
This softness will be reflected in fourth-quarter results, 'which we now
expect to be weaker than previously expected', he said.
Like much of corporate America, Dow is also adopting new accounting
standards. It now expects to post of loss of Dollars 1.70 to Dollars 1.90 a
share for the whole of 1992.
In 1991, Dow took special pre-tax charges of Dollars 370m which led to a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 94m, or 35 cents a share. For the whole of
1991, Dow earned Dollars 935m or Dollars 3.46 a share.
Analysts expect group 1992 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of about 40 cents a share.
Dow said its 1992 special charges reflect asset write-offs and write-downs,
plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of business
activities globally. Costs related to workforce reductions have also been
included in the charge.
The company recently announced a management shake-up aimed at creating more
flexibility in the management structure and improving international
competitiveness.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN's Spectra-Physics AB is selling one of its US subsidiaries for
Dollars 69m in a move aimed at reducing group borrowings and focusing more
on core businesses.
The purchaser of Spectra-Physics Analytical is the Massachusetts-based
group, Thermo Instrument Systems, a specialist in making instruments which
are used to detect and monitor air pollution, radioactivity and other
substances.
The sale comes two and a half years after Pharos, as Spectra-Physics was
formerly known, acquired the US group Spectra-Physics and more than doubled
its size.
The group became heavily indebted following the purchase, and a big
outstanding dollar loan has increased in krona terms following the Swedish
currency's effective devaluation.
Spectra-Physics, which is 80 per cent owned by Nobel Industries, specialises
in laser technology, microwave technology and industrial measurements. The
unit being sold manufactures and sells liquid chromatography analytical
instruments and data systems used in quality testing and research
laboratories.

Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator, is expected on Monday to report a marginal increase in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.7m to about Pounds 8.9m.
Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK
from overseas companies, and the performance of new products.
On Tuesday, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is
forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds
9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m. Lower interest payments, increased demand and
broader markets - especially Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind
the rise.
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included
from Tyne Tees. This would be a little below original estimates of about
Pounds 19m, but still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise.
Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to
nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the
annual results on Wednesday. Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about
Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m of exceptionals, against a profit of
Pounds 12.4m.
The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas
hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A
smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from
Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Boeing wins Dollars 5bn order for its 767s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING yesterday launched a programme to build an all-cargo version of its
767 twin engine wide-body aircraft after winning a Dollars 5bn (Pounds
3.2bn) order for 60 all-cargo 767s from United Parcel Service (UPS).
The Atlanta-based package delivery company has placed firm orders for 30 new
767 cargo aircraft and taken options on a further 30.
Boeing said it was the largest order for all-cargo aircraft it had ever
received. It comes as Boeing, like other manufacturers, is coming under
pressure from financially pressed airline customers to defer or cancel new
orders.
Detailed design engineering on the new cargo aircraft, based on the Boeing
767-300 extended range airframe, will begin immediately, with production
starting in the second quarter of next year, Boeing said.
The first 767 freighter will roll out of production and enter flight testing
in the second quarter of 1995 with delivery to UPS in October 1995.
The new cargo aircraft will be capable of carrying 56 tons of cargo over a
range of 3000 nautical miles or 45 tons as far as 4000 nautical miles.
UPS has not selected the engines for the aircraft.
Aircraft exports involving British Aerospace have won export credit
guarantees worth Dollars 106m, the Export Credit Guarantees Department,
Britain's official export credit insurer, said yesterday, David Dodwell
writes.
The guarantees have helped to ensure finance for the sale of nine aircraft
to five countries as part of the pan-European Airbus project. They concern
the lease of two A330-600R aircraft to Ansett Airlines of Australia, two
A310-300s to Tarom of Romania, and two A320s apiece to TransAsia of Taiwan
and Air Lanka. The purchase of an A320-200 by Tunis Air has also been
supported.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Frenchman to become chairman of Euro Disney

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Fitzpatrick yesterday resigned as chairman of Euro Disney, which
has faced speculation about its performance since the opening of the
FFr4.2bn (Pounds 510m) EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April.
He will be succeeded by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 42, a Frenchman who
orchestrated the development of hotels and property around the park. He
joined Euro Disney in 1988 from Accor, one of France's largest hotel and
leisure companies.
The news was greeted by a jump in Euro Disney's share price. The shares
closed 28p higher at 778p in London and FFr2 higher at FFr66 in Paris.
Euro Disney denied that the departure of Mr Fitzpatrick, 52, was related to
reports that the park was failing to meet its targets for attendance and
merchandise sales. It said Mr Fitzpatrick wanted to hand over to an
indigenous European management team, having completed the park's launch.
There had been speculation about his future at Euro Disney since September
when he ceded part of his responsibilities by making Mr Bourguignon
president in his place and becoming chairman.
Mr Fitzpatrick plans to set up a consultancy in Paris but will remain on
Euro Disney's management board.
Mr Fitzpatrick formerly worked for Walt Disney, the US leisure and
entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. He became
president of the European company in 1987.
EuroDisneyland was originally expected to attract 11m visitors in its first
year. Euro Disney has refused to disclose specific figures but recently
confirmed that the park, which was visited by 7m people in its first six
months, would probably fall about 500,000 below target for attendance in its
first full year.
Merchandise sales, and occupancy levels at EuroDisneyland's five hotels,
have also fallen below expectations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Euro Disney are hardly paying Mr Robert Fitzpatrick a
compliment by marking up its shares some 4 per cent on news of his
departure. They could easily be overestimating the significance, though, of
what is primarily a symbolic change. Having a French manager at the top,
especially one with the business skills of Mr Philippe Bourguignon, may make
a difference. The company appears to be signalling a new determination in
dealing with the disappointments that have marked its first year of
operation. That does not make its problems any less daunting.
There are limits to the extent to which Euro Disney can compensate for lower
than expected visitor numbers by cutting costs. Now that the pattern of
visitor flows has been established, Mr Bourguignon can perhaps adjust some
running expenses accordingly, but he can do little about the high fixed
costs including the need to service long-term borrowings of FFr 6.2bn. The
most promising approach appears to be an attempt to drum up additional
business by aggressive marketing, above all in France, where public interest
has proved lukewarm.
Even if he succeeds, shareholders may not realise much benefit. The company
still faces a large burden of deferred payments to Walt Disney in the US
which will be a continuing drag on its share price. But Walt Disney has
little incentive to change the arrangements as that would only upset its own
shareholders.

a consultancy in Paris but will remain on Euro Disney's management board.
Mr Fitzpatrick formerly worked for Walt Disney, the US leisure and
entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. He became
president of the European company in 1987.
One of the more off-beat tasks he undertook at Disney in the US was dressing
up as Goofy, the cartoon dog, and going around the Magic Kingdom theme park.
He explained that all Disney employees did a spell in animal costume to meet
the public and understand the business.
EuroDisneyland is the most expensive leisure complex yet to be built in
Europe. It was originally expected to attract 11m visitors in its first
year.
The company has refused to disclose specific figures, but it recently
confirmed that the park, which was visited by 7m people in its first six

first full year.
Merchandise sales and occupancy levels at EuroDisneyland's five hotels have
also fallen below expectations.
Euro Disney has cancelled plans for further property development around the
park because of the precarious state of the Paris property market. This has
led to a shortfall in projected capital gains, thereby increasing its
financial costs.
Euro Disney recently ann-ounced a pre-tax loss of FFr399m for the year to
September 30. Analysts expect heavier losses for the current financial year
which will, for the first time, include the slack winter months.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours comes under strong attack from
Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD yesterday attacked the hostile bid launched by its rival tour
operator Airtours, saying it had taken advantage of a profits fall that
followed one mistake over holiday pricing at the end of 1991.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, said shareholders should not
under-play the commercial benefit of its proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook,
the travel agency, which was designed to establish a pan-European tour
operator.
He warned that if Airtours succeeded in its hostile Pounds 214.7m bid, it
could create a duopoly in the UK market. Together Airtours and Owners Abroad
would control 33 per cent of the market against the current leader Thomson's
28 per cent, according to market figures from November last year.
Alternatively it could lead to a price war and the kind of wafer-thin
margins seen in the late 1980s. These had resulted in some tour operators
making only 90p profit on a Pounds 230 holiday.
Referring to Airtours' share bid, which is accompanied by a partial cash
alternative, Mr Klein said: 'If you are looking down the barrel of that sort
of thing who is going to want to take paper?'
Airtours' bid, he said, was a defensive move triggered by concern about the
threat from a tie-up between Owners Abroad and Westdeutsche Landesbank, the
German state bank that owns 86 per cent of Thomas Cook and 34 per cent of
LTU, the German charter flights and holidays company.
Airtours had provided no evidence to show it could run a group that would
have Pounds 1.2bn of sales. Nor had it justified claims that it would make
'substantially' greater cost savings in 1994 and 1995 than Owners Abroad has
said it would enjoy from its Thomas Cook deal.
Owners says the savings on that tie-up would be Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m in
the two respective years.
There were also fundamental flaws in Airtours' stated objective of wanting
to expand its Pickfords retail chain which it bought last September.
'The price war has moved from the tour operators to the retail part of the
business,' said Mr Klein. The deal Owners Abroad was proposing would allow
shareholders to enjoy the benefit of greater access to Thomas Cook's retail
outlets and brand name without having to own the chain.
Mr Klein accepted that Owners Abroad had initially set the pricing of its
summer 1992 holidays too high. 'Owners have got it right this year and
Airtours has got it wrong in Florida and Greece,' he said.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, denies its Greek pricing is wrong.
The company had cut its Florida prices, after gaining a rebate from Owners
Abroad's Air 2000 charter airline, after Owners had cut its own prices to
levels that had 'amazed the whole industry', he said.
Airtours' shares slipped 1p to 289p yesterday while Owners Abroad fell 2p to
113p.

THE Dutch government is to give companies tax incentives to encourage them
to buy electric vehicles.
Dutch businesses which invest in electric-powered company cars are to be
allowed accelerated depreciation of the vehicles under a new scheme designed
to promote the use of electric cars.
The pressures on the car industry to accelerate the development of electric
vehicles are intensifying. Toyota and Nissan, the two leading Japanese car
makers are joining forces to develop an electric car, according to Japanese
newspaper reports yesterday.
The newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said that Toyota and Nissan had begun talks
on the development of common electric vehicle components. Japan's ministry
of international trade and industry has set a target of having about 200,000
domestic electric cars in use by the year 2000.
Last month the big three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,
announced that they planned to co-operate more closely in the development of
electric vehicles.
The three companies have signed an agreement to investigate co-operation in
the design, development, testing and possible manufacturing of electric
vehicle components which would ultimately be used in each company's own
vehicles.
Two years ago the US car makers also formed a consortium to carry out
research and development on advanced batteries that would be capable of
providing electric vehicles with significantly increased range and
performance.
The state of California has been at the forefront of seeking to encourage
the use of electric vehicles through regulation - by 1998, 2 per cent of
cars sold in California are to be so-called zero emissions vehicles.
Yesterday's move by the Dutch government is one of the first inititaives in
Europe to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles through the use of tax
incentives.
The Dutch environment ministry said that electric cars have been placed on a
list of 400 environmentally-friendly products that provide tax breaks to
companies which purchase them. Thanks to the move, companies will be able to
set off against tax the full price of an electric-powered vehicle in the
first year of purchase. Petrol-powered company cars, by contrast, are
normally written off over five years in the Netherlands.

FT  16 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours may prefer to concentrate on persuading the market of the virtues
of its hostile bid for Owners Abroad, but it would be dangerous for it to
ignore the pressure building up on the competition policy front. The
Monopolies and Mergers Commission has grounds at least to take a look.
After doubling in size following a successful bid, Airtours argues it would
be better able to offset the aggressive dominance of the market leader,
Thomson. This would bring a better competitive balance to the package tour
industry even though the two leaders would control 60 per cent of it. A
cartelised market would not develop because of the industry's low barriers
to entry and its competitive character.
But the case looks suspicious, given the degree of vertical integration
developing. Since Airtours owns the Pickfords travel agency and Thomson owns
Lunn Poly, the travel business is starting to resemble the brewers' tie.
These two powerful players can push their own brochures through their own
travel agencies, at the expense of other operators. Even domestic ones such
as Rank, owner of Butlins, admitted this week to a sharp loss of business
last summer as a price war raged among package holiday operators.
The MMC might well conclude that the emergence of a strong number two is
desirable to temper Thomson. It may refrain from being any more ambitious
after its chastening experience of trying to free up pubs. But it is hard to
accept that that Airtours' bid for Owners Abroad only affects a limited
section of the holiday market.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Jobs at 10 threatened pits likely to be safe until spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS AT the 10 pits ear-marked by British Coal for early closure seem
assured of jobs until at least well into the spring after the government
yesterday gave consultants until the middle of March to report on the mines'
viability.
The likelihood is that there will be several weeks, or months, of debate
even after the report is completed. Unions have already said that they do
not accept consultants John T. Boyd as the independent scrutineer called for
by High Court judges last month. The March 15 deadline set by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may slip further. He acknowledged
this in the terms of reference which say that he may agree to a later date.
Before the High Court decision, British Coal had planned to make the miners
redundant on January 29. The corporation said yesterday that no decisions
would be taken on the pits' future until all consultations were complete.
Betws, in south Wales, yesterday became the last of the 10 to cease
production with representatives of the 90 miners there saying they had
figures showing it was heading for a Pounds 1m profit this year.
Perhaps the best hope for the 10 pits will be if the Commons trade and
industry committee recommends saving them when it reports this month.
Members of the committee will today receive ideas from Mr Richard Caborn,
the Labour chairman. However Dr Keith Hampson, a Conservative member, said
he thought about half the 31 pits initially suggested for closure could be
saved.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Outrage from press body: Lay members of complaints
commission protest at Calcutt comments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAY MEMBERS of the Press Complaints Commission yesterday expressed outrage
that their independence had apparently been called into question by Sir
David Calcutt's review of self-regulation of the press.
The Calcutt report described the commission as 'the creature of the
newspaper industry', and said that it could not hold the balance fairly
between the individual and the press.
Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, former chairman of the Inner London Juvenile
Courts and a founding member of the commission, said yesterday: 'I think it
is highly offensive to suggest we are a creature of the newspaper industry.'
Lord Colnbrook, who as Mr Humphrey Atkins was once a Conservative minister,
said: 'All the lay members of the PCC are totally independent. I'm retired
now and I don't give a damn about what the press think of me.'
He believed Sir David's assessment that the commission and self-regulation
had not worked had been 'strongly coloured by the fact the government didn't
carry out all the things he recommended'.
Lord Colnbrook said Sir David had not been to see the commission at work.
Lay members say Sir David had lunch with them, but declined an invitation to
stay to watch an adjudication session. The lay members are outnumbered by
those with newspaper connections on the commission. They include Dame Mary
Donaldson, a former Lord Mayor of London, Professor Lesley Rees, dean of
Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College in London, and Professor Robert
Pinker, professor of social work studies at the London School of Economics.
Sir David Chipp, a former editor-in-chief of the Press Association, said
yesterday that he was 'very cross indeed' about any questioning of his
independence.
Lord Rothermere, chairman of Daily Mail and General Trust, today denies in a
letter to The Times that he told Lord McGregor, chairman of the complaints
commission, that the Prince and Princess of Wales had each recruited
newspapers to give their own accounts of their marriage rift.
'I informed him from information at my disposal that it appeared to me that
the royal couple were seeking to use newspapers,' he writes, adding that
they had not 'attempted to forge links with our news-papers'.
The remarks allegedly made by Lord Rothermere to Lord McGregor were at the
heart of this week's controversy about whether the prince and princess had
exploited the press or had been exploited by it.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Insurance call sparks angry reply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLS by loss adjusters for insurance companies to strengthen claims
investigation procedures have produced an angry response from a leading loss
assessor.
Mr Nicholas Balcombe, chief executive of Balcombe Group, said yesterday that
insurance companies had been doing 'everything to minimise payouts' in
recent years.
Loss assessors generally represent policyholders, while adjusters negotiate
claims on behalf of insurance companies.
Mr Balcombe said insurance companies had 'dramatically slowed up the whole
claims process' by their increasing use of specialist advisers and
investigators.
The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters suggested on Thursday following a
survey of its members that a quarter of insurance claims were fraudulently
inflated.

subsidiary for Dollars 69m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN's Spectra-Physics AB is selling one of its US subsidiaries for
Dollars 69m in a move aimed at reducing group borrowings and focusing more
on core businesses.
The purchaser of Spectra-Physics Analytical is the Massachusetts-based
group, Thermo Instrument Systems, a specialist in making instruments which
are used to detect and monitor air pollution, radioactivity and other
substances.
The sale comes two and a half years after Pharos, as Spectra-Physics was
formerly known, acquired the US group Spectra-Physics and more than doubled
its size.
The group became heavily indebted following the purchase, and a big
outstanding dollar loan has increased in krona terms following the Swedish
currency's effective devaluation.
Spectra-Physics, which is 80 per cent owned by Nobel Industries, specialises
in laser technology, microwave technology and industrial measurements. The
unit being sold manufactures and sells liquid chromatography analytical
instruments and data systems used in quality testing and research
laboratories.

Swiss PTT Telecom is to become a full equity partner in a
recently-established joint venture between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands
and Televerket of Sweden which provides data transmission services to
European-based multinational companies, writes Ronald van de Krol in
Amsterdam.
The Swiss will own a third of Unisource, the joint venture company, as will
PTT Telecom and Televerket, which launched the company as a 50/50
partnership in June.
By joining forces in Unisource, the three national telecommunication
companies aim to compete as equals with Eunetcom, a joint venture between
Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telecom and France Telecom, as well as with
British Telecom's Syncordia operation. In June, Unisource signed up Sprint,
the US telecommunications carrier, to provide global links outside Europe
for its customers. Unisource is also looking for a carrier partner in
south-east Asia.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Berlusconi's brother for trial over political funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian media magnate, is to be put on trial on charges of illegal political
contributions, according to magistrates in Milan yesterday.
The announcement coincided with the arrest of Mr Umberto Di Capua, the head
of the multinational ABB engineering group in Italy.
Mr Paolo Berlusconi is one of 35 businessmen and politicians whom
magistrates intend to put on trial in Milan's largest political corruption
scandal.
He has been accused with Mr Sergio Roncucci, a senior executive of the
Berlusconi family's Fininvest holding company, of paying local Christian
Democratic party officials L150m (Pounds 71,320) in relation to a contract
for a big refuse site.
The arrest of Mr Di Capua is believed to be linked to allegations of illegal
payments to local politicians for contracts for the Milan metro's new third
underground line.
Last June, Mr Ivo Braglia, the head of ABB's transport division, appeared
before magistrates for questioning. ABB supplied substations and
radio-telecommunications equipment for the multi-billion lire line.
The allegations against Mr Paolo Berlusconi are likely to prove highly
embarrassing to the Berlusconi family. Although the two Berlusconi brothers
divided their business activities last year, with Mr Paolo Berlusconi taking
over Fininvest's property businesses, the family's early rise to fortune was
built largely on property development.
He said the money involved was a personal political contribution, and
therefore not subject to the rules on political donations by companies.
The arrests and investigations are the biggest move by magistrates against
prominent businessmen since last year's arrest of Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the
property magnate, who spent almost three months under investigation in jail.
Confirmation that inquiries have entered a new phase came with last month's
announcement that Mr Bettino Craxi, the Soclialist party leader, was also
under investigation. This week, magistrates sent formal documentation to the
Rome parliament for permission to proceed against Mr Craxi, who has denied
all the charges against him.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Signs of recovery in north-west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLOW but fragile economic recovery appears to be building in north-west
England and north Wales, according to the latest quarterly surveys by the
regional chambers of commerce and industry in Manchester and Liverpool.
After faltering last summer, domestic orders between October and December
resumed an upward trend which began in 1991. Business confidence has also
improved, and a few companies have revived investment plans. But
redundancies are forecast nevertheless.
Both chambers report buoyant export markets, with the Liverpool chamber's
service-sector members responding faster than manufacturers to the
devaluation of sterling in September.
Manchester chamber's manufacturers, however, reported strong export sales.

FT  16 JAN 93 / RiverBus nears survival target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S RiverBus was last night close to raising the funds necessary to
keep its service along the Thames running to the end of the year. With only
Pounds 140,000 still to be raised, it will be kept running over the weekend.
The loss-making service, which operates between Chelsea Harbour and
Greenwich, is an important link between central London and the Docklands.
It has been kept operational by the administrators of the Canary Wharf
development in Docklands, London City Airport and other interested parties.
However, the company had to raise Pounds 1.82m by the end of yesterday to
cover anticipated losses for this year.
Donations have been received from large companies, suppliers, staff and
individuals according to Mr Michael Davies, business manager. The
Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, Westminster City
Council and other riverside boroughs were also invited to contribute.
'We even received a Pounds 1,000 donation from a pensioner living in
Gibraltar,' said Mr Davies. The final effort to reach the target will be
made on Monday. While the company expects further smaller losses it believes
that the service will become self-financing by 1996.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Pensions change is proposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government could increase tax revenues by Pounds 1bn a year by ending
the exemption to those who take a portion of their pension in a lump sum on
retirement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said yesterday in a report
financed by the National Association of Pension Funds.
But it said there was no case for substantial changes to the tax structure
for occupational pension funds. The government hopes to encourage people who
opt out of the state scheme to stay out of it until they reach retirement
age.

AS MANY as 20 per cent of Names plan to reduce their involvement in the
Lloyd's insurance market and 10 per cent of Names are likely to resign in
the next two years, a Mori survey has indicated.
The polling organisation interviewed 601 Names - individuals whose capital
backs the market - last autumn. The results also suggest that 20 per cent of
Names plan to increase their commitments.
Some 2,000 of the market's 22,300 Names left at the end of 1992 while only
75 new Names joined.

A powerful earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale rocked northern
Japan yesterday, injuring at least 95 people but apparently causing only
minor damage, authorities said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The tremor, the
strongest to hit Japan for almost 11 years, was felt across the country from
the Pacific coast to the Sea of Japan, the national meteorological agency
said.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Draft deal on enforcing no-fly zone in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, ANTHONY ROBINSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   UNITED NATIONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain, France and Spain reached broad agreement yesterday on a
draft UN Security Council resolution allowing military action to enforce an
air exclusion zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina, diplomats said, Reuter reports
from the United Nations.
The western nations hope to present the text to the full Council on Tuesday
or Wednesday after Geneva peace negotiations on the war in Bosnia are
expected to end.
But Russia was said to have reservations over several paragraphs in the
text, which has been under consideration for weeks to enforce a no-fly zone
for military planes and helicopers established by the council in October.
Few details were available immediately but diplomats said they thought the
resolution would contain a 30-day warning period before military action
could be taken.
The draft will leave vague how much firepower to use to stop Serbian or
other aircraft flying over Bosnia.
But the envoys said Nato powers would have an understanding among themselves
to begin military action by intercepting planes before going moving to
bombing airfields as the US advocates.
The operation would be under the jurisdiction of the Security Council but UN
Protection Force commanders in Bosnia would be notified in advance of any
action, the sources said.
The UN has recorded over 300 violations, mainly by Serbian combatants, since
the no-fly zone was established in October. But only nine violations were
reported during the first week of January, seven of them from Serbian
aircraft, two by Croatians.
The self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs is to meet on Tuesday to
decide the fate of the constitutional proposals for Bosnia-Hercegovina
agreed in Geneva this week, official Serb sources said yesterday, Robert
Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor, writes.
A Serb official in Pale, the rebels' main base in Bosnia, said the meeting
would take place there but the venue might still change.
Meanwhile, Mr Cyrus Vance has 'no plans' to step down from his job as
co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Fred
Eckhard, his spokesman, said yesterday.
Mr Eckhard, commenting on a British report that Mr Vance was intending to
leave, said: 'We're working pretty much at fever pitch right now; there is
no question of his leaving the conference now.'
Over 1,500 journalists and staff have been sacked from Serbian radio and TV
in what the independent Serbian TV union condemned as a political purge
following the victory of extremist nationalist forces in last month's
Serbian elections, writes Anthony Robinson.
'We are angered that the victorious party, personified in Milorad Vucelic,
the head of Serbian radio and TV, has declared open warfare against its
political opponents in the media before it has even resumed power,' it said.
'The expulsions will be just a prelude to a country-wide persecution unless
the people behind the purge are stopped,' added a statement by the
opposition Serbian Renaissance Movement. 'Lists of desireable and
undesirable citizens have been compiled in all enterprises and
institutions.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Britain's editors: sad victims of royal scandal - How the
meek tabloids have been manipulated by scheming royals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S newspapers are under threat from a force so powerful that none has
been able to withstand it. We know this because the editors themselves have
told us how this mighty power has manipulated them, consistently, and over a
long period.
Strangely, it is just one person. She is a woman. She has no organisation:
indeed she has been compelled to share an office with her estranged husband.
She is no great intellect, without a single 'O' level to her name. She is
not a newspaper proprietor, indeed she has no power of any kind to decide
what shall appear in any newspaper. But this, apparently, is all irrelevant:
the press, innocent dupes to a man, have been consistently manipulated by
her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales. That, at least, is what they have
been saying all week.
Cynics might argue that this was merely a ruse, to ensure that they would
enjoy the sympathy of their readers at a time when the government was
contemplating whether or not to implement Sir David Calcutt's proposals to
set up statutory controls over the press. But that would imply that tabloid
newspaper editors would stoop so low as to manipulate their readers'
emotions - a disgraceful slur.
What is the basis of the newspapers' allegations about the Princess of
Wales? They must, surely, have hundreds of examples of her manipulation.
Well, as a matter of fact, they don't. It is all based on a single leaked
letter from Lord McGregor, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission,
to Sir David Calcutt.
According to McGregor: 'I was told by Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman
of News International, that the princess was participating in the provision
of information for tabloid editors about the state of her marriage.'
Knight's anxiety to put this opinion to Lord McGregor was understandable.
News International in its various guises was busily serialising Andrew
Morton's book on the Princess of Wales. Lord McGregor, acting quite outside
his remit, since his commission had received no complaint, took it upon
himself portentously to denounce the reports of Morton's book as 'odious
exhibition of journalists dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other
people's souls'.
Perhaps, if Lord McGregor had taken the trouble to ring up Knight
beforehand, he could instead have issued a statement denouncing the Princess
of Wales. For he subsequently appeared to take the hardly disinterested
words of the News International chairman as gospel, even though Morton
himself, who ought to know if anyone, has categorically stated that the
Princess did not co-operate with his book.
Instead, Lord McGregor merely complained, with breathtaking effrontery, that
'The Princess of Wales in this situation seriously embarrased the
Commission.' The media could not believe their luck: they could use
McGregor's gibberings to blame the Princess for all their own intrusions.
The Times, in attempting to back up Knight's claims about the Princess's
manipulations, stated with absolute assurance that the Prince Charles /
Camilla Parker Bowles taped telephone conversation was leaked to the Daily
Mirror (where it was first reported) 'by the Princess's friends'.
Richard Stott, the then editor of the Daily Mirror wrote to complain that
this was completely untrue, that the tape 'was offered to us at one of our
branch offices and it was recorded by a very ordinary member of the general
public. If you are looking for a plot you won't find it here.'
No, indeed. The only plot has been by powerful men to pretend that they have
been manipulated by one woman, when they have at all times had complete
freedom and discretion to publish what they want, when they want, how they
want. It is called the freedom of the press.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Private View: Why every new baby matters - Dr Norman Myers
believes that population is still the most important issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAMINES are returning, and so are the population experts to scare us
with their sums. But if their projections are even half-correct, why do we
pay so little heed to them?
My consultants told me to go and see Norman Myers. Dr Myers is no two-bit
Jeremiah: he advises governments and institutions such as the World Bank,
the OECD, United Nations and European Commission. He is not afraid of
upsetting politically-correct Greens by proposing market solutions. But even
he resorts to the occasional shocker.
'In terms of the amount it consumes and pollutes, the average British family
has not two children but more like 30 or 35,' he said.
So it's at the expense of others that we live?
'Yes. And that applies to all the other developed nations.'
Are you saying that a British or American baby is stealing from, say, a
Bangladeshi baby?
'I wouldn't quite use that term. I would say our increasing population and
affluence - dependent on artificially cheap fossil fuels - are bringing on
global warming which could mean Bangladesh losing as much as one fifth of
its territory within a lifetime.
'That's the equivalent of Britain losing all land south of London and
Bristol. We would be very indignant if that was caused by people round the
back of the world who'd been over-indulging.'
I'm impressed, I said, but what are we supposed to do? To be fair to the
Bangladeshis we'd have to go back to eating ground-nuts and living in tents.
'No, no. An acceptable level of affluence would be something akin to what we
had in 1970.'
How many fewer children should we have?
Myers paused. 'Well, I'd hesitate to offer an estimate because it's a
complicated calculation: I'm hedging, of course. The optimum population for
Britain, sustainable in a global context, would be a good deal less than
what we have now unless we're prepared to get into a much more streamlined
economy with far less waste and more efficient modes of production.'
Isn't there a more compelling argument for us to reproduce less, apart, that
is, from wanting the cash for more consumption?
'Suppose the trade-off was more vacations in the Caribbean or learning to
ski.'
I might do that, I said.
'Had you ever thought explicitly of that trade-off?'
Not personally, I said. But I'm sure people do, which is why they have only
1.7 kids, or whatever it is. But if we've got to bring it down to 1.1, isn't
it going to be a bit of a problem?
'Yes,' he admitted. 'It would be a very big problem.'
Norman Myers was not born an eco-freak. It was somehow reassuring to learn
that this modest marathon-runner read French and German at Oxford and worked
as a district officer in the colonial service in up-country Kenya before
that country's looming population explosion turned him to planetary
economics.
He travelled the world, took a PhD at Berkeley and worked with UN agencies
before concluding that he had no time for 'corridor politics', and set out
as a freelance consultant.
Why do people and politicians continue to ignore the sums you and others put
in front of them? I asked him.
'In many countries, such as sub- Saharan Africa, it's a culturally taboo
subject and politicians don't want to upset the electorate. In Latin America
they say the place is underpopulated because there is so much space. Some
countries believe large populations mean political power and economic
strength. They quote the US, Russia and Japan. They ignore the example of
Israel, say, or the Netherlands.'
I suggested population doomsters such as Paul Ehrlich and the Club of Rome
had spiked their own guns by exaggeration. Myers countered that since
Ehrlich's 1968 prediction of massive famine, 250m people had died of
starvation, though not, admittedly, all in one place. Technology had only
postponed the problem. For three decades to 1984 the plough had kept ahead
of the stork, but since then there had been eight lean years in which food
production had failed to keep pace. The Club of Rome report in the 1970s had
been premature, he admitted, and had ignored some important feedback loops
(eg prices) but its latest report was more sophisticated.
Why isn't the US taking a lead?
'Because American political leaders won't lead. They're too bound up with
their next election. They think that doubling the tax on gasoline to bring
it more into line with European rates would be unacceptable. In real terms
Americans were paying two and half dollars a gallon in 1981. They shouldn't
scream if they are asked to pay double the present price of Dollars 1.25.'
But all politicians were at fault in refusing to recognise that raising
fossil-fuel efficiency to match, say, the Japanese would be very good for
their economies.
How can you say Britain is overpopulated? I asked him. There is no
starvation. The rivers may be a bit low and the beaches a bit dirty, but we
live very comfortably.
'But we depend on a shadow ecology, as I call it, which is five times the
size of Britain and on which we depend for some 40 per cent of our food.'
He conceded that effective population control could take several generations
after millenia of carefree breeding.
'Governments are reluctant to intervene beyond the bedroom door. And yet we
accept a minimum age for sexual intercourse, for getting married. We plan
every aspect of our economies except the number of consumers.'
But aren't there moral limitations? Are Catholics who accept the Vatican
line on birth control to be coerced?
'No, not at all. But they are such a tiny minority now. Anyway the European
country with the lowest fertility rate is Italy and the part of Italy with
the lowest fertility rate is Rome.'
Surely you mean the Vatican City?
'I should hope so,' Myers laughed.
What about the Moslems?
'The Koran says various forms of contraception are legitimate. The real
problem is women in purdah. Only about 5 per cent have been to primary
school, their social standing is low and they can't stand up to their
husbands.'
You have said zero population growth could be achieved in Britain by the
'simple expedient' of preventing all unwanted births.
'It's simple but not easy. It's a matter of education. After a Saturday
night out and a couple of pints, anything can happen. That sounds awfully
patronising but there are a lot of people who end up with unwanted
pregnancies.'
There should be financial disincentives for having more than two children.
'If you have three and impose a lot of spillover costs on society then I'd
devise ways to make you pay those costs.' Myers referred approvingly to one
economist's proposal that everybody should be given a single 'child voucher'
at birth. Couples could have their two children or sell their vouchers to
someone else.
Enforcement could be tricky, I said.
'Exceedingly.'
The world population is over 5bn. In 100 years' time it could as high as 14
1/2 bn or as low as 8bn. 'There's a lot to play for,' said Myers. 'I say we
should go for the lower figure. Either we choose to do it or nature will do
it for us - and nature will not do it discriminately at all.'
Surely, it will discriminate against the poorest. People like you and I will
be as comfortable as ever.
'I don't think so. Because one of the predominant phenomena of the next few
decades, I believe, will be mass migration from developing to developed
countries. What we have now in Europe is peanuts compared with what lies
ahead. The social tensions we have seen in Germany and France already are
nothing to what is to come.'
Global warming could give Britain an arid Mediterranean landscape. In such a
world - 'a world in uproar and full of gunsmoke' - Britain simply could not
trade. There could be 300m or 500m refugees battering on the doors of the
rich nations. 'We win with the Third World or we shall lose with them,'
Myers said.
Yet it would cost only some Dollars 40bn a year to make agriculture in the
Third World environmentally sustainable - which is what rich nations already
spend on slimming aids. To meet demand for contraception would cost
taxpayers in the North a penny a week.
'It needn't cost the earth to save the earth and it would give a much better
return in the long run than anything available on the London stock
exchange.'
How many children have you got?
'Two: both daughters. And I dearly wish, I'm really ticked off that I
couldn't have more . . . for professional reasons. I wish there was a bank
or something at the United Nations to which I could pay Pounds 10,000 or
Pounds 12,000 a year to cover the social costs. And then, boy, I would
certainly have a third child. Heavens, yes.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: I have them all taped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE YOU read the 'Camillagate' tapes, which are said to be of a
conversation between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles? Do not
bother. They are juvenile and banal. Instead, let me offer you a fragment of
a tape I made on Thursday, all above board, of a four-way tele-conference I
arranged between the Queen, the prime minister, Lord King of Wartnaby (the
chairman of British Airways), and Hawks &amp; Handsaws. I think you will find it
instructive, for it shows how Britain is run.
Hawks &amp; Handsaws: I think, first, we might address Elizabeth's concerns
about the spring Budget.
Elizabeth II: Thankyou, Michael. As you know, Mr Major, I am soon to start
paying tax on a portion, yet to be announced, of my income. I shall sign the
cheques quite happily, safe in the knowledge that you and my other ministers
need money for motorways, airports, hospitals - all manner of good works.
What worries me are these reports that you and Mr Lamont are considering
raising income tax. To have to start paying income tax is bad luck enough;
to have the rate hoisted peremptorily, far above one's head, would be
enormously horrendous.
John Major: Let me assure you, your majesty, with promptitude and alacrity,
that the government will not be raising income tax in this Budget or any
other. As you know, the chancellor is an odd-ball - an entertaining fellow,
good at party conferences, but headstrong and flamboyant. I shall announce
his new post four weeks after the Budget. On the other hand, a considerable
sum of money has got to be found, so find it I shall. The Budget will reveal
subtle ways for rehabilitating the public exchequer.
Elizabeth II: I trust, Mr Major, that you are not going to commence phasing
out mortgage interest tax relief. I am in the process of mortgaging several
of my palaces. And then there is VAT. Until recently, I was oblivious of its
existence, but I am informed by my racing manager that I shall be liable to
grotesque amounts of VAT on my bloodstock transactions.
John Major: Have no fear, your majesty. The pernicious amount of VAT on UK
bloodstock is something which the Treasury is struggling to resolve. In the
meantime, I believe Michael wishes to broach a scheme for rehabilitating the
royal finances and recapturing the love and affection which formerly marked
your reign.
Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Yah, right. It is a deeply ingenious scheme, but it will
need a big sponsor. That is why I asked Lord King to join our
tele-conference. The reason, Elizabeth, for your loss of popularity has
little to do with your children and much to do with the government. It is
weary, worn and wracked. People are fed up, so they are directing their ire
at
the symbols of authority. What the monarchy needs is a PR coup. It is time
you won the Derby. You have hundreds of racehorses, but they are all
notoriously slow.
I have had a word with Henryk de Kwiatkowski, America's leading owner - you
met him in Kentucky - who will lease you a racehorse to run in the Derby. He
owns an unraced firebrand that cannot be overtaken and is sure to last the
Derby's 1 1/2 miles. Henryk will fly it to Britain. It will race in your
colours. Victory is assured. The populace will be delirious. What is more,
you can win millions off the bookies. They know nothing of this horse.
Elizabeth II: How remarkably super. Mummy will be delighted.
John Major: A quite considerable brainwave.
Hawks &amp; Handsaws: But we need a generous sponsor. I want this sponsor to put
up a special Derby prize of Pounds 25m - sufficient, Elizabeth, to cover
some of your income tax - plus extra funds to pay for a free day out on
Epsom Downs for up to 3m people. There'll be bands, food, Champagne - a day
of national reconciliation topped by royal victory in the Derby.
Naturally, British Airways came to mind. The fiasco of its dirty tricks
campaign against Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic will not be forgotten
until BA spends titanic sums on positive PR.
Lord King: You are right. I used to tell people that the way I ran my
airline was through fear. But fear is not enough. My lesson was painfully
learned. I am ready to atone. Pounds 25m is not a lot of money. You have an
old head on young shoulders. I should like to buy you dinner. Are you free
tomorrow?
After this the tape gets really interesting, but also a little saucy. A full
version will appear in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Comeback for Czech conductor - Andrew Clark talks to
Martin Turnovsky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than 20 years, the Czech conductor Martin Turnovsky was
cold-shouldered by artist agencies in the west. The Communist authorities in
Czechoslovakia never forgave him for emigrating after the Soviet invasion in
1968, and put pressure on anyone who tried to engage him. As a result, he
was unable to work in any of the world's major musical centres. Now 64,
Turnovsky has begun to make up for lost time. The past year has seen him
re-emerge as an inspirational force in Prague's opera and concert life, and
this month he brings the Prague Symphony Orchestra on tour to Britain.
Turnovsky was one of the most talented Czech musicians of his generation,
but by his own admission, he has had a stop-go career. The son of
music-loving parents in Prague, he spent the final months of the war in a
Nazi concentration camp. He won the Besancon conductors' competition in 1958
 -but Czechoslovakia's isolationist policy prevented him from travelling
abroad for the next five years. He became music director in Dresden in 1966,
but for most of the 1970s and 1980s was treated as a non-person in the
Communist bloc.
Today he has none of the recording contracts or high media profile of the
star conductor. What he can offer instead is long experience, a broad
repertoire, human warmth and the ability to get results - qualities
instantly recognised by the Prague Symphony Orchestra when Turnovsky
returned to the Czech capital in 1991 after 21 years' exile.
His concerts lifted morale and playing standards. Here were all the virtues
of old-world music-making - cleanly-sculpted performances, free of
idiosyncracy or blemish. The integrated sound and unforced musicality
Turnovsky drew from the orchestra seemed to tap a vital part of the Czech
musical heritage. Few were surprised when Turnovsky was appointed chief
conductor last year.
Ironically, Turnovsky had received a similar offer in 1970. 'For a while
after 1968, the government was still quite liberal,' he recalls. 'I had
resigned my post in Dresden in protest at East Germany's collusion with the
Soviet invasion, but we could still travel. When I conducted at the 1970
Prague Spring Festival, I was asked to succeed Vaclav Smetacek (the Prague
Symphony Orchestra's music director). But by then the atmosphere had changed
 -I realised it was our last chance to leave the country legally. It was a
painful decision.'
Turnovsky was denounced and given a prison sentence in his absence. He was
dropped by international artist agencies, including Harold Holt in London,
which were anxious to preserve their links with the Czech state concert
agency - the source of a plentiful supply of cheap, high-quality musicians.
'Everything was poisoned'.
He received a lifeline from George Szell, music director of the Cleveland
Orchestra, who had befriended the Turnovsky family in Prague in the 1930s.
His former teacher, Karel Ancerl, invited him to Toronto. Rafael Kubelik
also helped. In 1975 he became music director of the Norwegian Opera Company
in Oslo, and later moved to Bonn. His British opera debut came in 1988, when
his Onegin with WNO was praised for its combination of passion and
sensitivity. In recent years he has given a conducting class at the
Musikhochschule in Graz and seen his sons prosper: one is principal bassoon
of the Vienna Philharmonic, the other has a solo career as an oboeist.
Since Turnovsky's return to Prague, he has conducted Otello at the Smetana
Theatre (to be followed next month by Un ballo in maschera) and started
rebuilding the Prague Symphony Orchestra's audiences. The financial rewards
of such a commitment are few - which is probably why so few emigre musicians
have returned on an extended basis. Nor can he escape the problems of an
orchestra which is still coming to terms with the limits of democracy and
the need to generate more income.
But unlike the Czech Philharmonic, which is still divided over its
appointment of a German, Gerd Albrecht, as music director, the Prague
Symphony Orchestra knew its chief selling point was its Czech tradition.
'They asked me to work with them, and if they think I can help, it's my
duty,' says Turnovsky. 'The musicians realise they now live in a competitive
world, so there's a special effort. The potential is great. Technically
they're playing well, but I'm trying to get the strings to play with more
heart and a wider dynamic range.'
The programmes for the British tour were arranged before Turnovsky's
appointment, and include the usual helping of Smetana and Dvorak, plus the
two Brahms string concertos. Turnovsky would have liked to include a Martinu
symphony, but is pleased at the amount of Janacek: Newcastle and Leeds, for
example, will hear the Talich arrangement of the Suite from The Cunning
Little Vixen, while the London concert at the Royal Festival Hall on January
24 includes the Glagolitic Mass. Turnovsky counts it as 'one of the most
exciting pieces written this century - and also one of the most complicated.
The first time I heard it was in Prague, conducted by the young Kubelik. It
was an overwhelming experience for me. I hope it will have the same effect
when we play it in London.'
The Prague Symphony Orchestra's tour (January 21-30) opens in Dublin and
continues to Eastbourne, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Huddersfield,
Middlesborough and Birmingham.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: National gift for water colours - William Packer
admires the exhibition at the Royal Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PONT, that conspicuous ornament of pre-War Punch, got it just about right in
his studies of 'The British Character'. There she sits, the little old lady
confidently at work in the picturesque French town, her easel set up smack
between the tramlines in the middle of the street while the awed populace,
down to the cat and dog, looks on. Yes, we do pride ourselves as a nation on
having, as his caption puts it, 'The gift of water colours'.
That we should thus fix upon what we also instinctively characterise as a
minor form of the art of painting is a nice point. For, if this magnificent
exhibition at the Academy does nothing else, it demonstrates for ever the
absurdity of the distinction that would make oil on canvas inherently
superior to water-colour on paper, simply because it is oil on canvas. We
have only to look to Thomas Rowlandson, almost exclusively a water-colourist
and draughtsman, to take the proof.
Yet he, one of our most particular and engaging artists, is oddly
under-represented here. The question hangs in the air: would he, even now,
be taken more seriously had he chosen to work principally in oil on canvas?
John Frederick Lewis, the outstanding mid-Victorian water-colourist, whose
Orientalist subjects such as 'Life in the Harem' and 'The Pipe-bearer' were
the sensation of the 1850s, was later forced to switch to the more
profitable oil, simply to make a living. Clearly the prejudice is nothing
new.
Yet again, going through the show, it remains inescapeable that few of the
artists, the greatest among them especially, from Turner, Bonington and
Constable to Whistler, were exclusive specialists. The truth is that
painting of any kind is an extremely practical business and artists work in
whichever medium is most appropriate, or simply available, to their
immediate purpose. It may be more lasting and resilient, but oil paint is
heavy and canvas cumbersome. The natural portability of water-colour, its
flexibility of execution and speed of drying are obvious advantages, the
more so in a time when to be a landscape painter was to be a traveller, and
the British painter the most inveterate traveller of all.
That water-colour should also be as tricky and testing a medium as any,
requiring at any level considerable sophistication of technique, is an irony
quite lost in the enthusiasm of the amateur. In particular it requires a
commitment and decision that may be as extreme as anything of Zen
calligraphy and the formal conventions of the Far Eastern landscape
traditions. In the first period and introductory section - under the
somewhat stuffy label of The Structure of Landscape: 18th century Theory -
come Alexander Cozens and William Gilpin with their random blots in practice
and their theories of the romantic and picturesque landscape. That they
should actually achieve images of forest, lake and mountain so close in
spirit to the idealised landscapes of the Chinese masters must have been a
matter of intuitive sympathy, for the fact passes unremarked in the
accompanying texts.
Throughout there is more than enough of infinite charm to satisfy any more
literal and descriptive taste, from the topographical studies of Paul
Sandby, to the townscapes of Samuel Prout and Thomas Shotter Boys, to the
undergrowth tracery of John Ruskin and the birds' nests of William Hunt.
Even so, it is ever that technical engagement that, in its free-est and most
abstracted expression, takes the breath away. Turner, greatest of the
artists, supplies the thread that pulls the show together through its
several thematic sections, but he is also the best known and so not, for
once, the star.
Rather it is David Cox on Rhyl Sands, or perhaps Thomas Girtin in the Rue St
Denis, or John Middleton in a shady lane, or Linnell and Whistler with their
grey seas and sailing boats, or Peter de Wint, or John Sell Cotman:
whichever we are looking at, for its broad, radical simplicity of image, its
expressive spread of paint, its swift, comprehending, comprehensive stroke.
And was this truly the golden age? No, but simply the better known and the
more critically established. The inclusion of Whistler, with all it implies
of what was to follow, begs the question. There is nothing for it but
another and no less splendid show.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: The Bolshoy exposed - The difficulties of dancing at
the Albert Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING the Bolshoy Ballet in the Albert Hall is an odd and slightly
disorientating experience. There, exposed on a large and unflattering thrust
stage, is one of the world's greatest dance companies - or two-thirds of it:
this is not the full 250-strong ensemble - straining every muscle to tell us
about the physical exhilaration of its way of moving. And there, brightly
visible, is the BBC Concert orchestra, playing excellently, and providing an
alternative spectacle when - as during the infinitely tedious Legend of Love
on Friday night - you have to look away from a horde of rhubarbing men
dressed like Ali Baba and his forty chums. (Compliments to the two
trumpeters who dealt so featly with Arif Melikov's Brummagem score.) And no
less obviously there, the packed and encircling ranks of the audience, well
illuminated by the light-spill from the stage. 'What can they see so far
round to the side?' you wonder. Excellent views of head-gear and the
zip-fastenings at the back of the costumes, I'd hazard, though Yury
Grigorovich has been a pains to spread his dances wide and open them out to
as much of the public as possible.
And what do we actually see? As a Bolshoy devotee for four decades, and one
who has watched the company in many theatres, I recognise some of the
qualities I love with the troupe. Grandeur of scale, certainly, and
dedication to the idea of performance - nothing perfunctory, or time-serving
in interpretation. On these terms, the suite from Ivan the Terrible, which
opened Thursday's programme, was the best thing so far, and the one most
'like' its original in the theatre. The sweeping crowd of boyars and guards,
and the Tsar's full-throttle hysteria, that make the fabric of the piece,
were potent, and though Alexander Vetrov and Alla Mikhalchenko could not
efface memories of earlier interpreters of Ivan and his beloved Anastasia,
the fire of Grigorovich's theatrical vision blazed truly, and in Andrey
Uvarov we saw a magnificent Kurbsky - and a magnificent young danseur.
But the irresistible sweep of a performance in the theatre, that marvellous
sense in which we can be drawn into a production by Bolshoy unity of style
and devotion to the artistic cause of a ballet, is inevitably missing. The
Nutcracker was a perfunctory batch of divertissements - and under proper
conditions Grigorovich's staging is touching and magical - while the Legend
of Love suite must surely have proved incomprehensible to an audience on
dramatic terms. I have always thought it Grigorovich's weakest work -
because ethnically quaint about Persia - and at the Albert Hall it looked as
if far too many people were impersonating Wilson, Keppel and Betty in their
convulsingly sober sand-dance. It also lasted a thousand and one nights.
Maybe more.
And as I suggested in earlier comment, the principals' performances are
undermined by the lack of a proscenium arch to frame their interpretations,
and are dwarfed by the spaces of the hall around them. (Extraordinary to
write that about Bolshoy dancers whose artistry in the past has seemed to
reach out of the theatre to touch the world.) Yet if the company has not yet
shown us talents to rival those of recent seasons - Bessmertnova, Semenyaka,
Ananiashvili, Mukhamedov, Posokhov, Fadeyechev - it remains the Bolshoy
still, by force of dance presence and by the grand distinction of its
manner. But it is also the Bolshoy in the market place, a victim of the need
for hard currency, for bigger halls and bigger bucks. And that is bad news.
The Bolshoy Ballet continues at the Albert Hall until February 14:

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Time for a stronger Eros - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO ONCE again a damaged Eros has had to be removed from its plinth in
Piccadilly Circus, and Westminster City Council seems content to spend at
least Pounds 30,000 repairing Alfred Gilbert's statue of the god of love in
time for another reveller to smash it up. Since the GLC invested Pounds 1m
in a great refurbishment in the 1980s, Eros has been nothing but trouble.
Yet there is an easy, artistically acceptable, solution. Roger de Grey,
president of the nearby Royal Academy, wants to provide a permanent home for
the original Eros. He is prepared to pay Pounds 40,000 towards a replacement
for the Circus.
And the joy of the scheme is that the replacement would not be some latter
day copy. Gilbert's original plaster of Eros still exists, in the Victoria &amp;
Albert Museum, and Gilbert's original dealers, the Fine Art Society, has the
right to make ten casts from the plaster. It has already made eight and sold
six of them, for Pounds 140,000 each.
There is an Eros in Vermont, another in Pennsylvania, and one has just been
sold to Japan. The idea is to make another from the original plaster, but to
re-inforce internally the horizontal leg of the statue, the one that sticks
out, which is the weak spot and the target for the wreckers.
So Piccadilly Circus will get a stronger Eros, and the RA a world famous
exhibit. The FAS would offer a discount to add to the RA's contribution, and
Westminster would be well advised spending the money it is lavishing on the
repairs on completing the deal.
It is much easier to tempt companies into sponsoring the arts if they know
that their money is going to be boosted by a contribution from the Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, a Government funded honeypot which totals
Pounds 4.5m a year and is intended to offer matching money to first time
sponsors. At the moment the maximum pay out under the BSIS is Pounds 25,000,
but later this month it will be announced that this is to be raised to
Pounds 50,000 from April 1.
This is serious money, and should give a lift to arts sponsorship which has,
to date, ridden the recession well but which faces corporate cut backs in
1993. It is to be hoped that the stimulus will penetrate through to the fund
raising office at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which holds the
distinction that it has not managed to secure a penny from the BSIS in the
last four years.
Covent Garden has been able to hold on to most of its corporate members, but
this season not one new production has attracted a commercial sponsor.
Companies today are much more interested in getting a measurable return from
their sponsorship money, or spreading it into education and local
initiatives. The big, black tie, Pounds 100,000 plus spectacular is
currently out of fashion, but other national arts companies, notably the ENO
and the National Theatre, still manage to find sponsors for most of their
new productions.
London is awash with watercolours, which should suit the national mood.
Watercolours are the British art form - romantic, sensitive, and transient -
and the RA's ravishing display from the golden age (see William Packer's
review) should boost the World of Drawings and Watercolours which opens just
along Piccadilly at the Park Lane Hotel on Wednesday.
This hardy annual among specialist fairs usually does well. In the past the
bonus from Lloyds of London was often invested in another watercolour for
the drawing room. Little chance of that this year, but traditional buyers
from the shires, lured to London by the RA exhibition, will be tempted to
buy from the 50 dealers. The fact that prices begin at Pounds 50, and are no
higher than last year, should help business.
The Fair has succeeded in extending the range out from just jolly hollyhock
rural views. Gothick Dream will be showing Vorticist and Surrealist drawings
while Kate de Rothschild offers Renaissance drawings among all the Sandbys,
Cozens, de Wints and Girtins.
In vivid contrast another regular fair opens next week, Art 93 at the
Business Design Centre, Islington, which is now the only annual
concentration of contemporary art in London. It is no competitor to the
mammoth fairs held at Basle, Madrid and Chicago, but top dealers like
Waddington, Gillian Jason, and Angela Flowers are showing their big names,
and Annely Juda has been tempted in for the first time.
It is making something of a splash, erecting a monumental sculpture by
Anthony Caro, priced at up to Dollars 200,000, on the green in front of the
Centre. Just as striking should be the 11 works commissioned by pop star and
major collector, Peter Gabriel. Gabriel chose the artists, sent them tracks
from his new album, US, and waited for inspiration to hit them. The much
admired Andy Goldsworthy only received the lyrics of a song on a fax, but
went out and moulded a nest of twigs and branches in a dusty hollow created
by the drought near his Scottish home. He then watched as the rains came and
washed away his creation, but the photograph is now in the Gabriel
collection.
Antique dealers always say how much they dislike fairs and that there are
too many of them. But anything is better than sitting in an empty shop
waiting for the recession to end and every day sees the announcement of
another big new one. More and more dealers are forsaking their expensive
galleries to deal from home, using fairs as their shop windows through which
to meet new customers and catch up on trade talk. Wolfgang Fischer, Vanessa
Devereux, Anne Berthoud, David Hughes and Mark Glazebrook are just some
leading dealers who have chosen this route.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Parry, an almost Elgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUBERT H PARRY: HIS LIFE AND MUSIC by Jeremy Dibble Clarendon Press Oxford
Pounds 45, 570 pages
HUBERT Parry was almost, but not quite, the Elgar of his day. Elgar
acknowledged the kinship. Scholars have spent the years since Parry's death
in 1918 trying to explain the shortfall.
Much of Parry's achievement was against the odds. His mother died soon after
his birth and a youthful heart condition persistently interrupted his
career. His doting marriage conferred some income, but its stability hinged
on a frail, hypochondriac wife and insipid aristocratic relations.
Parry was a classic victim of the late-l9th century Brahms-Wagner divide.
His traditional grounding in harmony and counterpoint often threatened to
muzzle his thematic invention. He revered Brahms, but his instincts lay with
Bayreuth, whither, with his mentor and champion, the Liszt pupil Edward
Dannreuther, he made ritual pilgrimages, like Elgar after him.
An insatiable workaholic, Parry deputised for Grove on the first edition of
his pioneering musical dictionary. Succeeding to the directorship of the new
Royal College, he later became Professor at Oxford. Open, generous and
conscientious, he strove unsuccessfully to resolve the futile Elgar-Stanford
feud and was the principle inspiration to young composers of the successor
generation.
Tensions were inevitable: between academia and sufficient time for gestation
and composition (his output, including chamber, organ music and a dozen
volumes of songs, was vast); between symphonic writing, at which he
excelled, and the flood of fashionable religious cantatas solicited for
larger festivals and choral societies, whose sentiments quickly palled with
his Liberal, humanist leanings.
His solution to this, a sort of pantheistic or humanist 'ethical' cantata,
to a medley of texts by Browning, Bridges or himself, brought mixed success.
Had he allowed his Weimar inclinations unashamed rein, like Delius with A
Mass of Life, he might have caught the spirit of an era. His best efforts,
endlessly revised, remain uplifting, if bitty: their blend of rearguard
diatonicism and proselytising text can appear bland.
Jeremy Dibble's critical biography - the first for six decades - is as
welcome as it is overdue. Parry's family background (he inherited his
painter father's estate near Gloucester) and struggle for early recognition
while working for Lloyd's of London, are well charted. Elected a member of
the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1908, his relaxation involved sailing a 73-foot
ketch from Sussex to the coast of Galway, or entertaining friends like
Burne-Jones, Balfour and Mrs Pankhurst, whose demonstrations he espoused.
This is an enthusiastic, painstakingly researched book, backed by generous,
interspersed musical examples. It discerningly attempts for Parry something
akin to what Percy M. Young's Elgar, OM did for his successor. Some of the
wordier analysis preserves a ring of the doctoral thesis. But the judgments
are neither dogmatic nor cloying. Parry's correspondence and diaries have
been left dormant too long; that Dr. Dibble has restored them and reassessed
the music deserves our gratitude.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Controller time - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE USUALLY have the Controllers in their duty phone-ins at this time of the
year, though if they have important decisions to disclose this is hardly
where we shall hear them. Radio 4 in Call to Account last Saturday gave no
fresh news of the 24-hour news-coverage, but wise advice on hearing FM.
Callers to Radio 3 on Sunday were so relentlessly talkative that the
Controller could hardly get a word in. Radio 1's callers, also on Sunday,
may have liked as I did the Controller's wisdom on promotion and
presentation but mostly what they wanted was less chat and more variety.
Radio 2, on Tuesday of last week relied on Brian Hayes, and I missed him. We
still have to wait for Radio 5.
It was worth reviving Peter Buckman's dramatisation of Virginia Woolf's
Orlando (Radio 4, Monday), but how much less exciting the story seems today
than we thought in the 1930s. The adventures of Orlando, who lived from the
16th century to the 20th, changing from man to woman halfway through, was
derived from the character of Vita Sackville-West. Presenting them by way of
a narrator (Vivian Pickles) deprived them of some dramatic power; Jenny
Stoller did well in the name part, though detectably a lady throughout.
Penny Gold directed. We should now have Edna O'Brien's Virginia, about the
same great ladies but more sympathetic.
Radio 3's Sunday play was Tom Stoppard's Undiscovered Country, adapted from
Schnitzler. It opens on the death of a duel victim and ends on the victor of
another duel, each quarrel resulting from the infidelity of the same woman,
wife of the ultimate winner. Duels and infidelity are small-talk among the
wealthy Viennese on holiday in the Dolomites at the start of the century,
but the tale, hinging on the concept of honour, is not quite worthy of
either Schnitzler or Stoppard, and the dialogue has an oddly everyday
flavour. Maureen O'Brien and Ronald Pickup, though, were touching enough as
the liberally married pair, under Martin Jenkins's direction.
Woman's Hour is currently allowing Maureen Lipman to chat every day about
her life. Anyone who has seen her in Lost in Yonkers or answering
long-distance telephone-calls in television ads, will know something of
Maureen Lipman's peculiar charm; but what is so special about her life?
Precisely that it is like the lives of so many of us, and that in 'When's It
Coming Out?' she recounts it so delightfully. The series ends on the 18th,
but you can buy it on a BBC Radio Collection cassette and hear the lot.
I was unfair last week to label Craig Brown's and Myles Kington's new series
'unpromising' after hearing only one day's worth of each. Having heard two
more of both, I confirm my judgment. Brown's lines for veteran broadcaster
'Wallace Arnold' in Welcome to my Wireless are quite bare of wit, and Harry
Enfield's funny voices add nothing. Kington interviews the famous dead, this
week Robinson Crusoe (next, Mona Lisa). The dodge is to ask about the
matters they are reputed for and find that they do not want to discuss them.
Kington has an amusing manner, but his thrusts are often predictable.
I must also be unfair to Roger Graef's five-strong series, Living
Dangerously, which began last Sunday. He interviews young criminals, and I
can't tell if the next four will be as interesting as the first was. Bobby,
its subject, came from a rough, broken family, lived in sundry homes, stole
cars, thieved to buy 'grass' (he needed about Pounds 30 a day), only burgled
'rich' houses, carried a knife but never used it. After a course at
Sherborne House under the Probation service, he thieves no more, has begun a
computer course. It would at least be unfair not to draw attention to such
things.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Local boy made good - Alannah Hopkin enjoys the Irish
premiere of Billy Roche's trilogy in his home town, Wexford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEXFORD will be associated by many with the annual opera festival, where the
conviviality is every bit as memorable as the music. Last weekend an equally
friendly but far more informal festival surrounded the Irish premiere of
Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy on the stage of the Theatre Royal before a
mainly local audience.
Off season the Wexford welcome is as warm as ever, but there is no
disguising the fact that the rambling Victorian seaport has problems. The
young wander the streets at dusk, ghetto blasters blaring heavy metal, while
a muted carillon rings out the Angelus. 'Bet Here]' says a hand-painted
sign, while round the corner a chipped metal fingerpost reads 'Snooker'.
I ended up down at The Undertaker's - a bar owned by Eddie Macken's cousin.
I was not only in Wexford to see Billy Roche's plays, I was living them out.
It was eery.
When it was known that the trilogy was on its way to the Abbey in Dublin,
Jerome Hynes, Artistic Director of Wexford's Theatre Royal, saw the
potential for a 'community-based festival' celebrating Billy Roche's
achievement. Wexford Corporation and the Arts Council immediately came up
with the necessary subsidy. Hynes will not give any figures, but with
tickets at Pounds 6 each and only one performance of each play it was
presumably a significant amount. The Abbey co-operated with transport. A
book launch, a seminar, a civic reception and a brunch were added to the
programme and the result was The Billy Roche Weekend.
The irony of Wexford mounting a festival to celebrate work which shows the
town in an unflattering light was initially puzzling. The plays were
commissioned by the Bush Theatre, and gained six awards on the London Fringe
between 1989 and 1992. These productions come from the Bush with an
excellent cast of mainly London-based Irish actors. They are playing in
Dublin at the Abbey Theatre's small stage, The Peacock, until February 13.
The whole enterprise is representative of the close relationship between
London theatre and Irish theatre, with Dublin productions transferring to
London, and new plays by Irish playwrights being acclaimed in London before
being seen at home.
On Friday the cast had not quite conquered the challenge of playing to a
packed 550-seater as opposed to the 90-seater Bush, but there was no
mistaking the warmth of the play's reception. Roche reported that Wexford
audiences laughed in different places from London audiences; this is not
surprising - the repartee is razor-sharp, and the idiolect is pure Wexford.
When asked what he found so special about Wexford, Roche replied quite
simply, 'The way they speak to one another', and as far as his work is
concerned he is right.
It was good to see someone being so honoured in his lifetime, but it was
also rather bizarre. The event ran the risk of going over the top, and only
Roche's modesty and good humour saved it. Good as the trilogy is, at 43 he
is only at the start of his career.
In a toe-curling speech at the Civic Reception the County Manager linked the
trilogy to job creation and tourist development. Those who saw the plays
could have no doubts that they were not written to bolster the self-esteem
of the local community; they are as much about the need to leave the place,
and the sense of failure and entrapment that small town life can produce.
Roche's relationship with his home town is a typical love-hate one. 'I wrote
in spite of the town, not because of it,' he said, remembering that he got
no encouragement when he left home to become an actor - 'My father thought
I'd be making my own dresses next.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Arts: Moved by The Deep Blue Sea - Malcolm Rutherford hails
the revival of Rattigan's play at the Almeida theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TERENCE Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea struck me as one of the best and most
moving English plays I had read when I first came across it as a boy in the
1950s. At school we read John Osborne's Look Back in Anger at about the same
time. It seemed odd to discover from the Sunday newspapers that Osborne had
knocked Rattigan off the stage because there was no place left for a
well-made play with good manners. For Rattigan and the young Osborne had at
least one thing in common: they were masters of their craft. We were
astonished by the fickleness of the London critics.
With hindsight one can see that Rattigan's demotion had more to do with
fashion than with his abilities as a writer. His characters were too upper
middle class to have their emotions taken seriously. Such reverse snobbery
is now, I hope, behind us.
The Deep Blue Sea gets even better with time. There is one particular scene
which must bring a lump to the throat of all but the subhuman. It comes
early on when Hester Collyer has just tried to commit suicide by the gas
fire and is faced with Sir William, the husband from whom she has estranged
herself, now a QC. One particular line, too. They talk about the dinner
parties they used to give in Eaton Square, and which are still given by Sir
William. Hester comes back to her old social self to ask with genuine
curiosity and affection: 'Is David very pompous now he's Solicitor-General?'
How anyone could have thought such dialogue is artificial is beyond me. Here
is one of the most poignant scenes you will ever encounter.
Yet although this is the gem, The Deep Blue Sea is not a one-scene play.
There is pathos, wit, drama and even a touch of suspense all through. If you
have never seen it before, ask yourself at the interval how you expect it to
end. Probably you will guess right, but not with total confidence.
Hester is a complex part. She prefers physical passion to intellectual
detachment and a comfortable social life, but she knows what she has given
up in leaving her husband for a young lover and is articulate enough to
explain her motives. In Karel Reisz's production at the Almeida, she is
played by Penelope Wilton. Whenever she is on stage, which save for one
scene is practically all the time, it is impossible to take your eyes off
her. Ms Wilton works by having magnificent poise: very still, very
determined, none of the nervous twitchings of a Hedda Gabler. She does
nothing, even have an occasional spasm, without thinking. I doubt if Peggy
Ashcroft, who first played the part in 1952, did it better.
Hester is nothing, however, without a man. She needs the best possible male
supporting cast to go with her. In Nicholas Jones as her husband, she gets
it. Jones is very tall, very suave, the epitome of the well-dressed,
well-educated, well-off, emotionally inarticulate Englishman. Without Jones
to play against, Ms Wilton's performance would not be nearly so effective.
The hardest part nowadays is that of Freddie, Hester's lover. Possibly this
is where the play dates. He was a crack pilot in the RAF in 1940, a top test
pilot just after the war, but clapped out by the time he was 25. The
emotional impact of that is no longer what it was. If the play had been
written slightly later, Hester might have fallen for a Jimmy Porter.
Nevertheless, under Reisz's direction, Linus Roache does all that can be
done with the material.
The other outstanding performance is by Wojtek Pszoniak as the East European
doctor who has been struck off the medical register, presumably for what was
then indecency. The play has a history of being really about Rattigan's own
homosexual feelings. Pszoniak eyes Freddie's male friend in a way to bring
this out: he also saves Hester.
Yet watch Sandra Voe as Mrs Elton the landlady as well. This very English
play has everything: class in all senses of the term.

considers Dietrich and the true condition of stardom

<TEXT>
MARLENE DIETRICH by Maria Riva Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 792 pages
MARLENE DIETRICH by Steven Bach M HarperCollins Pounds 18, 610 pages
THE DAUGHTERS are massing on the skyline. The come-lately biographers are
gathering on the tree-branches. And the publishing industry is racing about
the land signing up memories.
Death in show business is a grim spectacle. No sooner has a deceased legend
completed his or her lying-in than the body is taken out to the vultures. Is
there anything new to be said about Dietrich? Oh, yes. Lots and lots,
according to these two books. There she is, the goddess with the smoky voice
and hooded eyes, peering out from the two interchangeable black bookjackets
with an interchangeable Mona Lisa smile, daring portraitists to penetrate
that enigma called a face.
Maria Riva, Dietrich's daughter, offers a family perspective on the legend.
What was it like sharing a house with Mum, Dad, Josef Von Sternberg,
Mercedes De Acosta (lesbian lover), Erich Maria Remarque, a dog, a maid and
anyone else who happened to be passing by with suggestions as to make-up,
love life or career direction. Steven Bach, a former United Artists
executive and author of the Heaven's Gate hatchet job, Final Cut, goes for
the movie angle. Onward we trawl through Morocco, Shanghai Express and Touch
of Evil, seeking the constant Dietrich in the changing movie character.
But of course the movie character never did change. Dietrich was as
immovable as a Caryatid through her seven great Von Sternberg films. (Not
all were great individually, but taken whole the septet was a mythopoeic
masterpiece). She did let the odd hair down in Destry Rides Again - fourth
hair from the left, if I recall - and she let a whole wig down as the
cockney-impersonating murderess in Witness for the Prosecution. But it was
the same Dietrich, whether hieratic or histrionic. She made film acting seem
easy because she never did any.
Yet she obsesses the entire world. In neither book do we quite find why,
though Bach's 600 well-researched pages are written with wit and vivacity.
He tunes in to Dietrich's camp charm and the absurdist cul-de-sacs of her
(best) movie plots. Of The Scarlet Empress: 'There is a war going on.
Finland? Doesn't matter. Back to the real battlefield - the bedroom.' And he
responds to Sternberg the stylist's dazzling line in petrified exoticism. I
laughed out loud when I read that Clive Brook came to Shanghai Express
having just had a face-lift. As if a movie needed two main characters with
paralysed face-muscles.
Bach enjoys the backstage secrets of the movie business. Dietrich's 'tape
lifts' (hitching her facial skin up to bestow instant youth); Charles
Boyer's sandblown, accident-prone wig in The Garden of Allah; Sternberg's
command that all the actors speak in the click-clack rhythm of trains in
Shanghai Express. But he never, we feel, quites knits the minutiae to the
macro-picture.
Dietrich became a star by bowing to all these imperatives. But she bowed in
a spirit not of obsequiousness but of lordly, luminous passivity. There was
a divine scorn in her obedience: a scorn that came out later in Maximilian
Schell's spellbinding documentary Marlene (Bach has a good passage on its
making). When Schell recorded the cranky star in Paris at age 82, she kept
calling everything she ever did in movies 'quatsch', German slang for tripe.
But the disdain she poured on her own legend was, of course, the disdain
that made that legend.
If Bach does not join all the dots, Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva scarcely
joins any. Her book's most inspired episode - Bach would have made a meal of
it - is thrown away. It depicts Dietrich on a farm, helping to deliver a
calf while dressed in a peach-satin dressing gown and using for lubricant
Elizabeth Arden's Blue Grass Facial Oil. This beats even the high heels
kicked into the sand at the end of Morocco or the pre-firing-squad lipstick
in Dishonoured.
Riva does not seem to possess a sense of humour. Elsewhere her book is at
once frank and elusive. Flying into the star's orbit like moths around the
flame are such exotics as Ernest Hemingway, Fritz Lang, Maurice Chevalier
and Mercedes Da Acosta (or, as Clifton Webb dubs her in a quoted letter,
Countess Dracula da Acosta). This gaunt vampira (see picture page 147) was
Greta Garbo's cast-off Sapphic friend and may or not have become Dietrich's.
But then may-or-may-nots abound. While Riva regales us with some
melodramatic certainties from her own life, including teenage rape by a
quasi-protectress foisted on her by Mum, the portrait of Dietrich becomes
fogged by the ever more prolix confusion of perhaps-lovers, floating friends
and quoted-at-length correspondents. Whenever Riva sharpens focus, it is to
be unflattering: from the 49 tormenting takes it took the new German star to
enunciate her virtual first word in a Hollywood movie - 'Help' - to the
final Sunset Boulevard-ish melodrama of Dietrich's dying days. 'Her once
translucent skin is parchment. She exudes an odour of booze and human decay
. . . Her snores are ragged, spittle trails from her furrowed lips. Like a
foetus she lies, bony hands cradling a sunken cheek . . .'
With daughters like this who needs demonographers? Domestic intimacy being
what it is, we learn facts about Dietrich from Riva that we could learn from
no-one else. But often they are spiteful, partial facts, conjured not for
improved portraiture, one suspects, but for personal exorcism. Bach's book,
a more traditional fan-heated tour through the career, gets us closer to
Dietrich the diva and to the strength of her lofty, luminous indifference.
If 'being' not 'doing' is the true condition of stardom, Dietrich 'was' more
radiantly and effortlessly than anyone else in movie history.

THE INVISIBLE MAN: THE LIFE AND LIBERTIES OF HG WELLS; by Michael Coren
Bloomsbury Pounds 20, 240 pages
IT IS difficult to think of any modern English writer who was less The
Invisible Man - invisible either in print or in person - than HG Wells.
Wells embodied the idea of the writer as a public figure, the writer as a
source of wisdom sought out by society to pronounce judgment on any issue of
the moment, from the modern girl to modern warfare.
If Wells were alive today we would be sick of the sight of him, constantly
bobbing up on television and telling us in his pipsqueak voice what ought to
be done about the ozone layer, AIDS, disarmament talks, the inroads made by
artificial intelligence, John Charmley's view of Churchill, and so on. He
would seem like Patrick Moore, Anthony Burgess, Tony Benn, Alan Clark and
Melvyn Bragg rolled into one.
But apart from being a pundit he was also a marvellous comic novelist in the
direct line of descent from Dickens - Kipps, for instance, is still a joy to
read and earns its rightful place in Oxford's World's Classics series. Anne
Veronica is another fine novel and a landmark of feminism. This is the
important side of Wells, the side that is still alive and kicking, Wells the
literary artist, the aspect of him that this book woefully neglects.
Michael Coren would no doubt justify using that early SF title against its
author for his partial view of Wells by telling us that the whole point of
his book is that, behind the legendary public man we know, there is a
sinister, concealed Wells that needs to be exposed. The young Wells who
delighted the Edwardian reading public with his scientific fantasies also
wrote Anticipations (1901), a think-book outlining his sense of the collapse
of the established order and his concept of a new Utopia to replace it: he
advocated genetic engineering, the suppression of inferior races, black,
yellow and Jewish.
This proto-fascist attitude cannot be dismissed as a mere youthful
aberration. Wells's racism and his view that the world should be run by an
elite of samurai persisted and crops up, as Coren documents, in later works;
some are now totally forgotten, but others like Tono Bungay and The New
Machiavelli are still read. It was only at the end that Wells gave up all
hope for the world in that final book, Mind at the End of its Tether,
published in 1945 when he was a sick and dying man.
In making his case Coren is obliged to take down some pretty dusty Wells
tomes from the shelves and, even if he did not have to cut their pages, he
must be one of a rather small group troubling to read them today. Still,
Wells put his name to these programmes of ethnic cleansing and he published
them. They were read, reviewed and made their contribution to the climate of
opinion. There is no gainsaying them and Coren is perfectly right to draw
attention to them.
Even at the height of his fame the image of Wells as a jolly uncle at a
family Christmas party was not accepted wholly uncritically. Rebecca West,
in a famous essay she wrote after her great affair with him was over, had
serious reservations about his work: 'All our youth (she wrote) they hung
about the houses of our minds like Uncles, the Big Four (Bennett, Shaw,
Galsworthy and Wells) . . . They had the generosity, the charm, the
loquacity of visiting uncles. Uncle Wells arrived always a little out of
breath with his arms full of parcels, sometimes rather carelessly tied, but
always bursting with attractive gifts that ranged from the little pot of
sweet jelly that is Mr Polly, to the complete meccano set for the mind that
is in The First Men in the Moon'. After more in this vein she put the boot
in and cruelly parodied him: '. . . his prose suddenly loses its firmness
and begins to shake like blanc-mange. 'It was then that I met Queenie. She
was a soft white slip of a being, with very still dark eyes . . . Oh, my
dear, she said, my dear . . . darn your socks . . . squaw'. But take him all
in all, Uncle Wells was as magnificent an uncle as one could hope to have.'
Wells was livid. 'The thing' he wrote in a private letter to her, 'is a lie
and a damned stupid one. You can go through all my books and list the woman
characters, not a bad lot from Aunt Pondervo to Joan and from Ann Pornick to
the Meanwhile women - and you can't find three pages to justify this
spiteful rubbish'. What hurt especially was the crack about 'darning his
socks . . . squaw'. It was the role played by Wells's wife Jane who condoned
his numerous affairs. In spite of her husband's ceaseless pursuit of younger
women, Jane remained firmly married to Wells until she died suddenly from
cancer in 1927.
Coren gives yet another account of Rebecca's affair with Wells. We have
already been through it several times in earlier biographies and viewed it
from the points of view of all the principal players - including that of
Anthony West, the fruit of the affair. Coren has had access to the Wells
papers in the University of Urbana, Illinois and he interviewed Anthony West
before he died. Coren's chapter, 'A Woman of Some Importance', is the best
researched part of his book. Here are the main events of the affair from the
standpoint of a detached observer.
Indeed, Coren has written a punchy stimulating book, if over-selective in
its treatment of the vast material. He deals much more more briskly with
most of the other mistresses, dispatching Moura Budberg - whom Wells said
was one of the few women he really loved - in half a sentence. Nor does
Coren seem to realise quite what a feat it was for this son of a housekeeper
and a professional cricketer to gatecrash an Edwardian literary world run by
the darlings of the country house set like Harry Cust, another great Don
Juan of the time. He appears here as Harry 'Crust' - a misprint but rather
an apt name for him.
Coren seems unaware too that Wells was in New York in 1941 lecturing at the
behest of the British Ministry of Information. The lectures were a flop.
Maugham, who heard them, commented on his old friend: 'he has always been
too busy to be much of a philosopher'. Coren's book makes the same point at
rather greater length.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Issues of sex and power - Zara Steiner on the pros
and cons of this feminist biography of Eleanor Roosevelt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZARA STEINER

<TEXT>
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: VOLUME ONE 1884-1933 by Blanche Wiesen Cook Bloomsbury
Pounds 25, 587 pages
THIS biography of Eleanor Roosevelt would not have appeared 20 years ago.
This is not just a question of new documentary sources or even the current
preoccupation with the childhood traumas and sexual activities of our
political leaders, male or female. The new feminist biographers, and Blanche
Cook is one, insist that the issues of sex and power are as central to the
study of women's public roles as men's and that women's passions can provide
the key to their influence and importance.
Rather than the dutiful wife of an American president sublimating her
interests and passions, ER, as she is called throughout this account, is
portrayed as an assertive and independent woman who created her own feminist
agenda. Cook's biography is all the more provocative because in her own
memoirs ER deliberately obscured the historical record, minimising her
political ambitions and revealing almost nothing about her intimate private
life. Her closest friends remained silent and, for the most part, concealed
or destroyed the letters that would have opened Pandora's Box.
In this first volume of two, Professor Cook dwells on ER's complex
inheritance, the alcoholic but adored father and the beautiful if shallow
mother who died when Eleanor was eight. Eleanor's first moment of self
discovery occurred at Allenswood School in London's Wimbledon, where the
Strachey girls and other daughters of the enlightened, wealthy
Anglo-American elite received a disciplined but liberating education. In
this heady emotional and intellectual atmosphere the orphaned ER flowered,
gaining the inner self-confidence and broader range of sympathies so
important to her later development.
The debutante, secret fiancee and then wife of Franklyn Roosevelt returned
to New York to live the conventional life of her sex and class,
distinguished only by a difficult relationship with her domineering
mother-in-law, in whose house she and Franklyn lived, and by the sense of
entrapment and depression that came to engulf the young mother of six. It
was Franklyn's turn to politics and, above all, the shock of discovering his
love affairs that opened ER's inner gates.
Franklyn's flirtations and his almost exclusively masculine political life
encouraged Eleanor to become active in the 'new women's' political groups of
the 1920s. Here she made her first feminist friends, including the political
activists, Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, a lesbian couple who later lived
in a cottage on the Roosevelt estate and with whom ER enjoyed an intimate
personal and professional relationship for over 15 years. As her husband
climbed the political ladder, ER embarked on her own career in politics,
journalism for women's magazines, and part-time teaching at a girls school
bought and run by Eleanor and her friends.
Cook is particularly acute on the kind of bondage created by financial
dependence, whether between mother and son or husband and wife, and its
effects on the Roosevelt marriage and ER's quest for independence. She
catches the tensions created by Eleanor's double life during the early
stages of her husband's struggles with polio and the growing gap between
ER's mother-wife and politician-teacher roles.
The personal compromises and the totally unliberated treatment of her own
daughter suggest how incomplete was ER's emergence from the conventions of
the times, despite her strong female friendships and an independent power
position in an anti-feminist Democratic Party.
There is more in this volume about ER's emotional involvements than about
her political activities though Professor Cook sees them as equal parts of
the same story. These include not only Eleanor's close friendship with Nancy
Cook and others but also her relationship with Earl Miller, the handsome,
young bodyguard who became her companion, defender and champion.
The volume ends with the Roosevelts' move into the White House and the start
of what is described here as Eleanor's lesbian affair with Lorena Hicks, the
Associated Press's senior woman reporter. With so much of the evidence
missing and final conclusions always a question of judgment, Cook follows up
every lead and includes every detail.
If only she had used a more delicate brush when filling in the political
background and selected a wider range of colours when dealing with her male
politicians, we might have been spared some of the all too numerous
illustrations of FDR's shallow and opportunistic political convictions:
Professor Cook's claim that men enter politics for personal fulfilment while
women try to get things done is, even in terms of ER's odyssey, open to
question. A good feminist biography does not need to fight the war of the
sexes.
Commercial reasons apart, the decision to conclude the volume in 1933 raises
questions about the feminist approach to historical biography. In the
not-so-distant past, when little was known about the intimacies discussed
here, it was ER's outspoken political views and public causes that made her
an exceptional presidential wife and the focus of interest and intense
debate. Is it a hopelessly outdated suggestion to say that the sexual life
of any statesman or stateswoman is only of historical interest because of
what they did or accomplished?
If this first volume, written from a feminist perspective, brilliantly casts
its subject in a radically different light, the next must locate her in a
broader context involving issues that go far beyond those of power and
pleasure. It still remains to be seen where ER should stand in the pantheon
of feminist heroines. The focus on who she was and how she lived makes sense
only because of Eleanor's subsequent political and humanitarian
contributions.
If Cook finds the right balance between ER's private and public worlds, she
will not just have created a stir at a time when Hillary Clinton comes to
Washington but will have significantly advanced the cause of feminist
biography. As someone who regularly read Eleanor Roosevelt's syndicated My
Day column, I found this a fascinating and revealing, if disturbing, book. I
wait to read the next volume.

considers Lawrence's sexuality

<TEXT>
LAWRENCE'S WOMEN: THE INTIMATE LIFE OF DH LAWRENCE by Elaine Feinstein
Harper Collins Pounds 18.00, 275 pages
ON Lawrence in love, there are two stories. In the first Lawrence the hero
was a sexual prophet who understood women and whose novels - especially
after the Lady Chatterley obscenity trial - hastened the sexual revolution
of the 1960s. About 20 years ago, this character began to be challenged by
Lawrence the villain, a puritanical misogynist who wrote about women's
sexuality to compensate for his inability in life to relate to them, and
whose books still encourage patriarchal oppression.
This new account of Lawrence's lovers and friends extends the debate. Elaine
Feinstein is perceptive and sympathetic, though offering neither a scholarly
nor a radically new approach. But the old anecdotes are told with verve and
pace; by condensing so many tales of friendships broken, romance ruined by
fear, Feinstein draws a compelling portrait of a man whose defensive
dogmatism wrecked his and other lives.
Creativity and sexuality are threaded together in Lawrence as in no other
writer, so the story of his women is at once the story of his life and the
mainspring of his work. A sickly mother's boy who loathed his coal miner
father - 'now we are going to be very happy while Father is away,' he
announced when his father had an accident - Lawrence was a hit with the
opposite sex from the start.
In his teens, he began the turbulent but chaste friendships with women which
lasted through life. He shared his literary hopes with Jessie Chambers, who
launched him into print by sending his work to Ford Madox Hueffer's English
Review and waited years for him to become her lover. But he was too deeply
in thrall to his mother, and their brief, fumbling affair was an intense
disappointment. Their story is Paul and Miriam's in Sons and Lovers, which
Jessie called 'a fearful treachery.'
Lawrence was unrepentant: 'If I need any woman for my fictional purpose, I
shall use her. Why should I let any woman come between me and the flowering
of my genius?' The pattern recurred, most famously later in his career in
the satire on Ottoline Morell as the pathetic bohemian hostess Hermione in
Women in Love, written while Ottoline was keeping Lawrence in funds.
In 1912, the neurotic inexperienced writer met the older, worldly woman who
could replace his mother: Frieda Weekley, the bored wife of a Nottingham
University professor, was a German aristocrat, daughter of Baron von
Richthofen, and a disciple of Freud. She repaid her husband for a disastrous
wedding night - she perched naked on top of a wardrobe and he coldly ordered
her to come down and get dressed - by a string of affairs: her elopement
with Lawrence to Germany, and their subsequent wandering across Europe and
America, is one of the great literary love stories of our century.
John Worthern, in his superb biography DH Lawrence: the Early Years (1991),
argued that Frieda's influence led Lawrence to see women's liberation in
overwhelmingly sexual terms when the mass of women, like Jessie Chambers,
felt as oppressed by class and lack of education as by sexual convention.
Feinstein, by contrast, charts his work as the response to Frieda's
voracious demands and his own sexual terror. It surfaces desperately in the
poems ('Why were we crucified into sex?') and in The Plumed Serpent, which
prescribed female passivity and denied satisfaction as a moral duty. It is
also the undercurrent of Women in Love, about 'the difficulty in finding
salvation through sexual love', and Lady Chatterley, written when Lawrence,
like Sir Clifford, was impotent and his wife was betraying him with a
younger, wilder man.
Feinstein is excellent on Lawrence's mask of cruelty to cover weakness -
denying his own TB, he called the tubercular Katherine Mansfield a reptile
'stewing in consumption' whom he hoped would die. Bertrand Russell,
receiving a viperish letter which accused him of 'repressed mental blood
lust', decided Lawrence 'led straight to Auschwitz'. Lawrence's refusal to
face his own repressions created psychologically dishonest
characterisations, such as Birkin, the self-portrait in Women in Love.
Feinstein is not the last word on the fiction or on the life, but her jigsaw
of the paradoxes make between them an account which no Lawrence lover, or
hater, would wish to miss.

<TEXT>
IMPOSSIBLE VACATION by Spalding Gray Picador Pounds 14.99, 228 pages
BROKEN VESSELS by Andre Dubus Picador Pounds 15.99, 195 pages
BREWSTER North, the angst-ridden narrator of Spalding Gray's memorable first
novel, suffers from a dire complaint - he just can't enjoy his holidays. The
moment he arrives in India or Las Vegas or Amsterdam, he finds himself
wondering if some other destination might not be more suited for his psychic
well-being. To make matters worse, he has serious doubts about whether or
not he has enough of a life to leave behind. As a result, he is forever
undertaking arduous journeys that somehow land him, unfulfilled, on his own
darkened doorstep.
Gray is best known for his remarkable film Swimming to Cambodia, a monologue
account of his quest for a 'perfect moment' in Thailand. Impossible Vacation
presents a similar pilgrimage. It opens with young North visiting the beach
with his disturbed mother, who soon travels to that great Butlins in the sky
via a fume-filled garage. All is idyllic until an uncle returns from the
South Pacific, filling boy Brewster's head with postcards of paradise that
haunt him for the rest of his life.
Thus begins his tortured progress from experimental theatre in New York to
experimental sex in Amsterdam, from an ashram in Poona to a prison in Las
Vegas. It is only when he descends into the Grand Canyon that Brewster is
able to achieve some sort of peace, to pass through the Nothing to Declare
chute of his own soul.
Gray's book is funny, full of insight and often quite bold, especially in
its sexual sequences, which include Brewster's ill-starred career as a porno
film actor and his affair with a woman with a penchant for pig masks.
Spanning the 1950s to the present, it provides a consistently ironic view of
a generation's failed attempt to track down paradise. But, as anyone
familiar with Gray's work will know, what really distinguishes the book is
its voice - mordant, obsessive, working overtime. It is the voice of
neurotic America, of the soul that arrives in Eden only to wonder what's the
next stop on the itinerary.
Another distinctly American voice can be found in Broken Vessels, a
collection of non-fiction by one of that country's most under-rated short
story writers. Like his fellow realists Carver, Ford and Wolff, Andre Dubus
is a grunt in the army of American literature, working his way slowly yet
relentlessly through the battlefield debris of his nation's daily life. His
non-fiction bears the same virtues as his stories - resolute honesty,
detailed perception, effortless prose.
The book's first essays are the most accomplished, particularly 'Under the
Lights', which depicts Dubus's boyhood job of chasing foul balls for his
local, woebegone baseball team. There is also a memorable account of a
cross-country train ride, as well as a shocking brush with America's
constipated legal system. These essays are followed by examinations of the
pitfalls of a career as a short story writer, the book's weakest section,
that should appeal mostly to fellow authors.
The last group of essays deals with what is no doubt the meat of the book -
the horrific injuries Dubus suffered in a 1986 car crash, leaving him
confined to a wheelchair. Dubus writes about his plight with unblinking
honesty, whether it be the effect of his paralysis on his young marriage or
the terror of watching helplessly as his one- year-old daughter severs her
finger. The ex-Marine even finds it hard to stand up to a lout in a theatre,
not out of fear but rather because 'if you confront a man from a wheelchair
you're bullying him. Only a coward would hit a man in a chair.' Fiction
writers such as Dubus are often judged by their ability to cast a cold eye
on imagined tragedy. It is a testimony to Dubus's skill and integrity that
he is able to bring this dispassionate vision to bear on a very real, very
personal crisis.

THE COLLISION OF TWO CIVILISATIONS: THE BRITISH EXPEDITION TO CHINA 1792-4
by Alain Peyrefitte HarperCollins Pounds 20, 621 pages
THIS is a very remarkable book, not only for its contents but also on
account of its structure. It is very long - 621 pages dealing with the 22
months that it took Lord McCartney to take his diplomatic mission to China
and back. He hoped to establish an embassy at the Celestial Court. He failed
utterly, so 600 pages may seem a very generous amount of space and the
method adopted by Peyrefitte may seem leisurely indeed.
The art of Peyrefitte lies in his use of chapters. Chapter I begins with
McCartney's departure from Portsmouth on September 26 1792; 80 chapters
later, on September 6 1794, McCartney drops his anchor in Portsmouth, his
mission completed. Each day of McCartney's journey is covered; no chapter is
less than three pages and none more than nine. This could have led to
tedious monotony but Peyrefitte at times allows himself to cover
considerable periods in short chapters - the outward and inward journeys,
for instance, mentioning only incidents such as stopping at St Helena on the
way back.
However, he uses these repetitive days of sailing very neatly: on the
journey from Madeira to the Cape Verde Islands, for example, he sketches the
political and social climate in which McCartney had pursued his career and,
in the next chapter, as they skim along before the trade winds, the outlines
of his biography are covered and the structure of his character delineated.
Once China is reached the chronological tempo is diminished: chapters cover
a few days, some only one. And here the longueurs are again avoided by
discussions of Chinese food, buildings, dress, agriculture, women's feet,
pederasty among the Mandarins, etc. The history and geography of China in
general, and of the Manchu world in particular, are conveyed with remarkable
economy and clarity and, when the long journey is completed, not only is the
enormity of the disaster revealed but so is its inevitability.
During the journey Peyrefitte weaves a vivid tapestry. He brings alive the
Chinese countryside, the harshness and monotony of the landscape of the
north, and the vivid sub-tropical South with its richness of colour and
abundance of produce. He brings home to us the vast size of the Chinese
Empire with its teeming peasantry and multitudinous craftsmen and merchants,
outpopulating Europe, including Russia.
For four thousand years, in spite of civil wars, the infiltration of
Buddhism and thousands of peasant uprisings, the institutions of government
had strengthened, not weakened. Furthermore, China had enjoyed a
considerable technological advantage over the world beyond its bounds,
especially in hydraulics. Peyrefitte makes us see how reasonable was the
mandarins' and emperors' monumental conceit and why they regarded
McCartney's eruption into their world as an unseemly irritant to be got rid
of, with courtesy but minimal cordiality, as soon as possible.
As chapter follows chapter the characters - McCartney, his deputy Staunton
and his scientists and artists - become rounded personalities. Peyrefitte
understands their bafflement, at times their wonder, but, more importantly,
he stresses as day follows day the growth of a more critical attitude
towards the Chinese and their society, with the filth, the disease, the
absurd dependence on necromancy, the attitude to women. For McCartney their
utter failure to show the slightest interest in the Western technological
marvels which he had brought the emperor as presents completed his
disillusion. Voltaire's image of China (based on self-flattering reports
from Jesuit missionaries) as a well-ordered state created by philosophers -
stable, rich, with outstanding technical skill and effortless wisdom -
vanished.
McCartney now realised that the Chinese empire would never change, except
through force. As Peyrefitte so wisely points out, even force and decades of
Maoist communism have been unable to break down these cultural attitudes
that have been building up like a coral reef for 4000 years. Hatred and fear
of foreigners, the rock-like belief that the Chinese way is always the best,
and best interpreted by aged men, still persist. Chris Patten should read
this book.
Although most of what Peyrefitte writes about is based on the work of
scholars, he has discovered two new sources of the highest value which he
uses with skill: one, the annotations made by the emperor himself in scarlet
ink on edicts and documents relating to the embassy, and the other an
astonishing, clear-eyed, perceptive diary of young Thomas Staunton, a boy of
12, the only Englishman on McCartney's staff to speak, write and read
Chinese. By the time he returned home at 14 he had come to the right
conclusion - that it would take war to break open China; he spent his life
promoting it.
This is a wonderful book, a work of very high intelligence and remarkable
clarity, suffused with wisdom and a deep sense of the problems of human
existence and cultures. It is a very great achievement and the small
chapters make it easy to devour.

NEIL KINNOCK was at his most talkative. He had rung twice during the day
without getting through. Now the former leader of the opposition was in full
flow. He wanted to talk about rugby and specifically the international
championship, which begins this afternoon.
Whatever you might feel about his political views, Kinnock's thoughts on
rugby are worth paying attention to. He attended the same school as John
Dawes, the brilliant captain of the all-conquering British Lions of 1971. He
has dabbled in refereeing and when his constituency duties permit he has
coached mini rugby at London Welsh.
'Where would I put my tenner?' he mused aloud, and even on the other end of
the telephone you could detect the smile of pleasure on his face as he
considered the question. He, a patriot, was between a rock and a hard place,
forced to express too much admiration for England, anxious not to write off
Wales.
'England's backs are terrific footballers' said Kinnock. 'If Rory Underwood
played in the centre I would be very frightened. He has been under-exploited
on the wing and he is such a great defender. Carling is so creative and
courageous, Guscott is just magic to watch and Rob Andrew can do anything.'
In the end, though, Kinnock said he would not risk his money on England,
suggesting there were too many imponderables for Will Carling's team to be a
good bet for an unprecedented third grand slam in as many years. In this he
is almost alone.
Man for man England are far better than any other side. If you doubt this,
compare each England player with his opposite number in the other countries.
There are no Irishmen who are better, only one Welshman - Robert Jones is a
more accomplished scrum-half than Dewi Morris - and only a couple of Scots
and French.
Furthermore, I would back England against a side chosen from the best of the
four other countries, such is the hegemony and commitment they have built up
these past few years. If selection is based on talent alone, and nationalism
is kept out of it, then England should provide a record total of players for
the British Lions party to tour New Zealand this summer.
The French at Twickenham this afternoon are one of the two serious threats
to England even though they have lost the past five games against England.
Pierre Berbizier, the French coach, talks about this game as one in which
the quality of France's play is more important than the outcome. The French
are anxious to forget the bad-tempered games against England in the World
Cup in 1991 and the championship last February. Two Frenchmen were sent off
during this latter game and later suffered a large measure of humbug and
sanctimoniousness came from English officials.
The French are not saints. They have a tendency to kick, which to the
British smacks of cowardice because the victim is defenceless on the ground.
But England are not angels either and Kinnock is not the only person who
believes that the English forwards know how to antagonise their rivals and
have exploited this dubious tactic to their advantage in the past.
The new-look French team includes Jean-Francois Tordo, a flanker at hooker,
which seems a dangerous, though typically French, idea. Furthermore, the
French dislike Twickenham. They call it le cathedral and speak of it as one
might of a haunted building, as if shivers are running down their spines as
they do so.
'France on the right day might do it if everything goes their way,' said Bob
Dwyer, coach of the world champions, Australia. 'On such a day France have
the game to win though they have not developed much these past few years.
But as long as England are right, I can't see them losing.'
It will be no picnic for England against Wales at Cardiff where they lost,
surprisingly, in 1989. Wales are moving ahead slowly. They need regular
doses of dirty realism to puncture the sort of misguided optimism that burst
out after they had beaten Ireland last season.
It was hardly a convincing win - by one point and Tony Copsey was lucky not
to be sent off for landing a punch on Neil Francis that would have done
credit to Frank Bruno, if that is not being unfair to Copsey. It is true
that it was Wales's first championship win since 1989 but it hardly
justified the excitement that surrounded it. At the end of the game former
internationals such as Brian Price, J J Williams, Barry John were
cock-a-hoop. I heard one of them say: 'It's the triple crown now.'
Alan Davies and Bob Norster, as coach and manager respectively, have brought
some realism to the national team. Their off-the-field organisation is
almost as good as that of England and one cannot say fairer than that. The
problem that Wales have is they do not have enough good players in the front
and second rows nor do they have a stand-off. Most of all, they need an
on-the-field general in the way Dawes was when he captained Wales in the
seventies.
'If Wales are not psyched out in Cardiff' said Kinnock. 'If they get the
share of line-out ball that they got against Australia and if they can make
an tactical change ten minutes into the second half if things are not going
their way then they can beat England. I know those are a lot of ifs but it
can be done.'
My prediction is that England will top the table with four victories, France
will be second, Wales third, Scotland fourth and Ireland, who scored only
three tries last season, will be bottom again. I am seriously tempted to
place a tenner of my own on England. The white tornadoes have one more title
in them. If they win it for me, I will donate my winnings to a charity - of
Kinnock's choosing

FT  16 JAN 93 / Sport: Smooth path for Seles - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEFENDING champions and top seeds, Jim Courier and Monica Seles, were
treated kindly in yesterday's draw at Flinders Park, Melbourne, for the
ADollars 7m (Pounds 3.1m) Ford Australian Open which starts there on Monday.
Courier can face no-one ranked higher than 69 en route to the fourth round
where his seeded opponent would be the young Spaniard Sergi Bruguera. The
remarkable Seles, 19 and already the holder of seven Grand Slam titles, has
a quiet quarter with either Gabriela Sabatini or Jana Novotna cast as her
likely semi-final opponent. Fortunately for Seles the lively Spaniard,
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who beat her last year in Montreal, is in the lower
half. So is another 1992 conqueror, the teenage Olympic champion, Jennifer
Capriati of the US. These two will form the chief challenge to the No 2 seed
Steffi Graf who no longer seems troubled by the ankle injury which hampered
her last week when she and Michael Stich won the Hopman Cup for Germany for
the first time.
It is impossible to look beyond Seles as the likely champion. She has lost
only once in a Grand Slam final during the past two years - to Graf at last
year's Wimbledon where her attempt to stifle the natural grunt she emits
whenever she strikes the ball ruined any chance she might have had of
beating an in-form opponent. Already the double-handed world champion has
issued a plea for understanding about this vexed question.
'I said after Wimbledon that if I do grunt, great; if I don't grunt, great .
. . I just can't stand everybody talking about it . . . it took so much away
from my game, so I don't want to make an issue of it.'
Martina Navratilova (ranked 5) is the only woman among the top 30 who is
missing. At 36 one can understand Martina's desire to harbour her reserves
for a determined attack on a 10th Wimbledon title.
The most remarkable woman in Melbourne is not a player - at least, no longer
a player. The former Bulgarian champion, Julia Maleeva (nee Berberian), is
the mother of the three sisters Manuela, Katerina and Magdalena. All are
seeded. This is a record. We should strike a medal in Julia's honour.
No medals are due to the British women. Only American-born Monique Javer has
bothered to challenge. A sad reminder of Britain's lowly place in the tennis
firmament.
The men's singles looks ominously strong with only Andre Agassi missing from
the top 10. The enigmatic American has never played at the Australian Open
and was a last-minute defector with a bronchial infection.
If, as he should, Courier reaches the quarter-finals, he might find either
the gifted Czech left-hander, Petr Korda, or the tall Dutchman, Richard
Krajicek, as his opponent. Korda is one of the most exciting of the
newcomers with hints of Rod Laver about his game, but Krajicek, who was
prevented by injury from playing his semi-final last year, is going through
a slump. In the semi-finals, Courier should play Boris Becker or Michael
Chang.
Courier has not won a tournament since successfully defending his French
Open title in June. An early loss would probably cost him the world No 1
ranking, either to his old friend and rival from their days at the Nick
Bollettieri Academy, Pete Sampras, seeded No 3, or to Stefan Edberg, the No
2 seed.
It is a subject Courier does not like to dwell on. 'As long as I am
comfortable with the way I am playing, the ranking will take care of itself.
It took a while to absorb all the pressures but I don't put extra pressure
on myself by thinking too much about it' he says.
He has certainly looked comfortable enough in Adelaide this week in the Rio
Slazenger Challenge, an eight man special event which he won last year. This
sort of pressure-free match play on the same Rebound Ace surface and with
the same balls provides excellent practice for Melbourne.
Edberg, is also in Adelaide with his wife Annette and his British coach Tony
Pickard, but not yet completely free of the cold he picked up in Qatar last
week where he lost in the semi-finals to Becker. Pickard said he was content
with Stefan's draw which suggests a quarter-final against Ivan Lendl,
recovered at last from a groin injury, or Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, a
semi-finalist last year. Either Sampras or Goran Ivanisevic, the fifth seed,
should be lying in wait in the semi-finals.
Becker's prospective fourth round match against fellow German Stich is a
tantalising prospect for it was a loss to Stich in Hamburg last year that
prompted Becker to seek help from Gunther Bresnick to improve his fitness.
Anyone who saw Becker's superb form in winning the ATP Tour Championship
last November will know just how successful their work together has been.
Both Becker and Stich crave recognition as the leading player in Germany so
every meeting between them has a special significance. The lone British man
in the draw is Wimbledon hero Jeremy Bates. He plays Heath Denman, a
22-year-old wild card from Queensland.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Sport: Into the future on the cutting edge - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOUG SAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL YOU still be skiing in the year 2010? We are all getting older, but
demographic research indicates that by the first decade of the 21st century
the majority of the skiing population will be 'over the hill'.
Statistics compiled by the United Ski Industries Association indicate that
while most skiers are currently between 25 and 34, by 2010 the largest group
will be veterans between 45 and 55. No one knows whether the hordes of young
snowboarders will make the transition to two skis, or give up winter sports
altogether.
These veteran skiers will be fitter, and better off financially.
Furthermore, the end of the cold war will allow winter resort development to
spread to huge areas previously untracked. Already, helicopter skiing in
former Soviet republics is drawing rave reviews.
Even so, growth in the ski industry is predicted to continue at its current
glacial pace. Global warming, recession and even the ecological backlash
have all helped slow the schuss which began in the 1960s, when the masses
were introduced to package skiing.
In the past few years ski and boot manufacturers have suffered enormous
losses. Sales of skis in Britain are running at less than half their peak in
the 1980s.
The travel market has responded with unheard of bargains and price
breakthroughs. Ski the American Dream recently advertised a full week of
skiing in California, with non-stop flights and unlimited mileage car, for
less than Pounds 400.
Skis will continue to evolve in materials and design towards the perfect
carved turn, initiated by the skiier simply pressing a foot down flat on to
the ski. Bumps and bunions will be eased by foam and silicon injected ski
boots as comfortable as carpet slippers.
Skis and boots are already 'inter active' in the new Marker Selective
Control binding, which can be adjusted for varying snow conditions.
Electronic bindings are expected on the market within five years.
Gizmos have always attracted skiers. Gadgets such as the Ortovox electronic
'mouse' which allow one to home in on a ski buried in powder snow should not
distract attention from the single most important development in skiing, the
parity between comfort and performance.
Skiing gear, both hardware and clothing, is becoming so non-intrusive that
you hardly knows it is there. Yet the ordinary skier is able to float
through deep powder (on the new Atomic wide body skis) or carve rails
through sheet ice (on a slalom ski such as the Volkl P10) with more
authority and security than an Olympic champion of any previous generation.
Once they have been let loose in thigh high powder snow, skiers are
reluctant to return to the piste. Skiing is splitting into fringe
disciplines. Surf and telemark are the most visible trends. The future is in
adventure skiing: off piste excursions, ski safaris, snowcat and helicopter
skiing.
Good skiers are abandoning groomed and crowded pistes for transalpine ski
safaris, which offer more varied and extensive skiing in a week than many
resort skiers experience in a lifetime. Wilderness skiing by snowcat or
helicopter allows the committed skier, for whom time is more scarce than
money, into the kind of untracked, heady snow which is available in resorts
only once or twice a season.
Ecological awareness has encouraged more skiers to invade the wilderness,
seeking the 'natural' experience of snow structures untouched by piste
machines and far from the irritating crowds. But it has also brought moves
to curtail unrestricted off piste skiing in the Alps. The future for such
'free' skiing is in Canada, where authorities still welcome development of
resorts and helicopter operations, and in previously unexploited terrain
from Kashmir to the Caucauses.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Motoring: A Jeep off the old block - Four-wheel drives are
now also kings of the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MYTH is that four-wheel drives are bought to be driven over trackless
country into the wild blue yonder. The reality is that most of them - in the
civilised west, at any rate - are used on hard roads, just like normal cars.
All of which makes the future look bright for the Jeep Cherokee estate cars,
newly arrived in Britain with right-hand steering, because they are more
car-like to drive than any rival. The Cherokee also makes most of its rivals
look rather expensive. Prices start at Pounds 15,345 for a 2.5 litre,
four-cylinder, 122 horsepower Cherokee Sport with a five-speed gearbox, and
rise to Pounds 20,995 for the leather-seated and wood veneer-trimmed
Cherokee Limited SE.
This Jeep flagship has a four-litre, six-cylinder, 184 horsepower engine,
automatic transmission, air conditioning, ABS brakes, power-adjusted front
seats and heated door mirrors - to name only the most important of its
goodies.
After more than 600 miles (1,000 km) of on-road - mainly motorway - driving
in several six-cylinder, two-pedal Cherokees, I do not think any
recreational 4x4 can match it for a combination of performance and value.
This four-door plus tailgate estate takes four adults in considerable
comfort, five without too much squeezing. The large, internally-stowed spare
wheel makes luggage space adequate, rather than generous.
The Cherokee is nimble in traffic and as parkable as a family car because it
has light, power-assisted steering and a commanding range of vision. It
rides more like a family car than any of its on-off road rivals. Winding
roads do not make it wriggle or roll and one feels very little thump from
its big tyres. The beefy engine and smooth-shifting automatic take a
Cherokee from 0-60 mph (0-96 kph) in 9.5 seconds, outpacing any on-off road
4x4, the Pounds 38,393 Range Rover LSE included. A top speed of 112 mph (180
kph) is claimed.
High gearing (under 2,400 rpm at 70 mph/112 kph) makes the Cherokee a
relaxed motorway cruiser. The transmission kicks down smoothly and eagerly
for quick, safe overtaking. Engine, transmission and tyre noise are subdued;
the main disturbance to radio listening on a motorway is wind roar. The
plastic storage boxes between the seats and in the fascia need a lining to
stop things put in them from rattling around.
On the road, you can choose between rear-wheel or four-wheel drive at any
speed. On a fast, 300 mile (483 km) drive in wet weather, I tried both.
All-wheel drive on the return journey made the Cherokee feel even more
sure-footed but it was no noisier and fuel consumption (19 mpg or 14.86
l/100 km) was unchanged. The four-litre Cherokee will pull a 2,500 kg
trailer.
Also in the UK's Chrysler Jeep dealerships this week are the first of a
range of Wranglers. These have their roots in the Jeeps of world war two.
They still have leaf springs all round, but power steering, a good heater
and a hardtop with wind-up windows make them infinitely more civilised.
Last summer, I spent two days bumping and banging seemingly unbreakable and
unstoppable Wranglers over the sun-baked rocks of the Rubicon Trail in
California. More recently, I found they went just as well in good old
English mud.
But even rugged Wranglers are more likely to be seen on British roads than
slithering up and down hillsides or plunging into wader-deep water. Young
drivers, dismayed by the cost of insuring hot hatchbacks, have been turning
to what they perceive as sporty four-wheel drives.
I could live happily with a Cherokee as a road car, though I would find a
Wrangler too much of a hair shirt. But Chrysler Jeep UK believes the
Wrangler (from Pounds 12,495 with a 2.5 litre engine and five-speed gearbox)
will give Suzuki's Samurai and Vitara and the Daihatsu Sportrak a run for
their money.
Is Cherokee a challenger to Britain's Range Rover and Land Rover Discovery?
The Range Rover I doubt, though its low price and lavish specification could
seduce some Discovery buyers. Most of these, however, now choose the
turbo-diesel, not the thirsty petrol V8 which is the only one with automatic
transmission. The arrival of right-hand drive Jeeps will make Britain's
recession-resistant 4x4 market expand further.
Next year, the bigger, V8-engined Jeep Grand Cherokee will meet Range Rover
head on. Also coming are diesel Cherokees, powered by an improved version of
the Italian VM engine used until recently in Range Rovers. Before then, a
4x4 estate car jointly produced by Ford and Nissan in Spain will also have
gone on sale in Britain.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Property: Moments of madness bring in the money - England's
follies are now highly prized for their individuality and spectacular siting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THEY were the aristocratic equivalent of plastic gnomes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the ultimate status symbol; but the follies of the 18th and 19th century
have now become an integral part of the British landscape.
Some regard them as vulgar ostentation, but Gwyn Headley believes them to be
the 'manifestations of architectural individuality that made this country
the cynosure of the world'.
Headley is so convinced of the appeal of follies that he and three partners
have launched Pavilions of Splendour, an estate agency specialising in
unusual buildings.
Prices, in keeping with the general theme, are quoted in guineas. The
follies on offer cost between one guinea and 1m guineas.
Most follies were expensive jokes with no utility other than as somewhere to
store the croquet sticks or shelter from the rain. Now, however, those that
survive are much sought after as unusual homes, built as many are in prime
scenic locations.
Take, for instance, Sway Tower, to the south of the New Forest. Headley
believes it is 'the greatest pure folly tower in Britain' - joint agent Fox
&amp; Sons describes it as one of the most remarkable buildings in England.
The tower, started in 1879, took Andrew Thomas Peterson six years to
complete; from the belvedere on the 218ft summit, there are breathtaking
views as far as the Isle of Wight and Salisbury cathedral.
The present owner, Paul Atlas, said: 'Peterson was an eccentric judge who
returned from Calcutta determined to prove that it was possible to build a
tower without reinforced concrete.'
No scaffolding was used by the 40 labourers working on the job. Atlas bought
the cottage in the shadow of the tower in 1973; he bought the tower later
and poured all the family's energy and cash into its restoration after the
1987 gales.
In June last year, it opened as one of Britain's most unusual hotels, with
just four bedroom suites housed in the tower with its 330 steps.
There is an indoor swimming pool, a floodlit tennis court and other
outbuildings, including a snooker house. Together with the cottage, Sway
Tower can be bought for one million guineas.
Another folly on the agency's list is Hadlow Tower, soaring 170ft above
Tonbridge, Kent. The grade-one listed, octagonal tower was built in 1838 as
an addition to Hadlow Castle, built by William Barton May in the late 18th
century and known as May's Folly.
The current owner, Michael Kiesser, is looking for a partner to buy a
half-share in the folly for about 700,000 guineas, to establish some form of
leisure enterprise.
Pavilions of Splendour has some decidedly unsplendid temptations as well;
there is, for instance, Deepings Lodge, in Deene Park, Corby,
Northamptonshire, which could be your home for just one guinea.
The snag is that the guinea buys a 21-year full repairing lease, and there
is a lot of repairing to be done on the little 19th century stone lodge,
plus the provision of main services.
After many years as a hospital, Craig-y-Nos Castle, in Abercraf, Powys, has
been restored to the sort of elegance furnished by soprano Adelina Patti,
who bought it in 1878.
Patti built a scale replica of Bayreuth State Opera House, plus aviary,
conservatory, winter gardens, chapel and many other rooms. Although much of
the restoration is complete, there is potential for developing the remainder
of the castle.
This means the 550,000 guineas price guide could be just a start, but there
is already a monthly turnover of about Pounds 30,000 from functions and
musical events.
But is it fair to describe builders of what we call follies as eccentric?
'My great-aunt Jessie would have said that her amphitheatre and temple of
the winds were two of life's essentials,' said John Blake, who inherited
Clovers, in Tenby, from the old woman.
Jessie Allen lost her fiance in the first world war and threw herself into a
drama teaching career at Cheltenham College and at her Welsh clifftop home.
Many a budding thespian had a first taste of Shakespeare in the
amphitheatre.
Jessie's Indian-style bungalow has now been replaced with a five-bedroom,
single-storey home, with distant views of Lundy and Caldy Island and the
Devon coast. There are five acres of land sloping down to private, sandy
beaches.
The amphitheatre, with tiered seats cut into the ground, has a raised stone
stage. Nearby is the temple, built by Royal Academician Alan Strawbridge; it
once had glass wind chimes suspended from its domed cupola.
The house, land and follies are offered for 250,000 guineas.
Knight, Frank and Rutley has had a good year for Shropshire follies. After
agreeing terms for two of the four follies at Weston Park, the firm now
offers Sham Castle in Acton Burnell, Shropshire.
Built in the 1780s as a music room for the Bruce Smythe family who owned the
surrounding estate, the folly was restored in the 1980s and is now a
comfortable home with remarkable views. The hexagonal first-floor drawing
room and its intricate plaster-work ceiling is especially beautiful. The
agent eschews guineas, asking Pounds 185,000 for a 90-year lease.
Among a number of follies on the market is a little castle and a stone boat
house on the Didlington Hall Estate, Norfolk; but Savills says a buyer will
have to take on the 460-acres of lakes and farm and all the buildings as
well. The original mansion was demolished in 1950 so this could be one of
the best building 'plots' in the land. Savills also moves with the times,
giving the guide price in pounds - Pounds 850,000.
Likewise with Hamptons, which suggests Pounds 200,000 for the octagonal
gazebo in the gardens of the original Richmond Palace, by the Thames. The
beautiful folly, dating from the early 18th century, has been meticulously
converted into a little home; among the features are arrow-slit windows, now
filled with stained glass salvaged from a nearby church.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Fishing: Other fish to fry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE often found myself envying other fishermen for their skills, none
more so than a Frenchman I met on the Suir in Ireland. He was a dentist from
Paris, small, neat and astonishingly accomplished. He extracted the
devilishly educated trout from that devilishly difficult river with an ease
which put my ham-fisted efforts to shame. I have been similarly humbled
watching Italians, Belgians, and Spaniards, not to mention Poles, Slovaks
and Romanians.
This is fly fishing, which is, and has long been, an international sport.
But the majority of the army of anglers across Europe seek their pleasure in
species other than trout and salmon. Their joy is in pike, carp, perch and
the like. And here there is a gulf between the British and their continental
counterparts which it will take more than treaties, summits and avalanches
of regulations to bridge.
Quite simply, it is a matter of why we fish, and the division can be
illustrated linguistically. In French, there is a word friture, for fry-up
of little fish. In Italian it is frittura, There used to be a word in
English, tansy, but it has fallen into disuse because we no longer fry
little fish.
The typical French fisherman is not my Parisian acquaintance. He is a figure
in a beret, hunched by the Seine, a caporal stuck to his lower lip. With an
immensely long pole, he flicks out an infinitesimal bait, whisks out a
minute fish, and drops it into a bucket, where he cares not if it lives or
dies. At the end of the day, he scoops up the harvest and sets off home,
already hearing the sizzle of olive oil.
This is not the British way. Here, we gaily kill and eat our trout and
salmon. But, in general, the lesser fishes - be they fat, toothsome carp, or
lean, firm-fleshed pike - go back alive.
I doubt if one in 1,000 British coarse anglers has eaten a capture.
The old books are full of quaint recipes for freshwater fish. But we have
lost the habit. Within the UK coarse fishing fraternity, a puritanical
aversion to killing fish has developed. A man found knocking a carp or tench
on the head risks violence and expulsion from his club.
With this invincible prejudice comes the assumption of moral superiority.
The average British fisherman knows little of how they do things abroad. But
he knows that the continental angler beats everything he catches to death,
and then cooks it with strange and unnatural ingredients. He thus regards
him as a barbarous fishmonger, sunk in primitive beastliness, indifferent to
the suffering of his prey and to the welfare of the environment.
The view from abroad is equally unflattering. To the continental, the link
between quarry and table is central to the sport. He is a hunter, a provider
of food. The idea of sitting for hours, enduring every kind of discomfort,
only to return the catch to the element from which it has been removed at
such cost is laughable. It is another species of English madness.
I like to think I can see the strengths and weaknesses in both philosophies.
It seems to me wasteful and wanton to kill every fish you catch, whether
anyone wants to eat it or not, and it is a depredation which waters cannot
stand for long. But I hate the English intolerance and ignorance.
I will be doing my bit for culinary and piscatorial bridge-building this
year. But the lead must come from the top. One day, perhaps, the prime
minister will tuck into carpe a l'ancienne at the Elysee; and offer the
French president at the return banquet stewed eel or barbel stuffed with
sweetbreads, crayfish and artichokes. Then we will know the barriers are
coming down.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Truth of the Matter: Milton] thou shouldst be living at this
hour - England hath need of thee, says Nigel Spivey, who especially commends
him to David Calcutt

MILTON'S Areopagitica is one of those classics of English prose more often
quoted than read.
'As good almost kill a man as kill a good book.' It is packed with such
proverbs and pieties of independent authorship easily quoted whenever the
question of censorship arises.
Yet its quotability does it disservice. It ought to have furnished
principles of guidance to Sir David Calcutt: but presumably he, like the
rest of us, supposed Milton to be defending the freedom of authors, not
journalists; since not even their most brazen supporters would claim that
any conduit of the gutter press carried 'the precious life-blood of a master
spirit'.
Re-reading the Areopagitica, I find that it survives remarkably well not
only as the classic case for works of art to find free expression, but also
a valid argument against most of the measures proposed for curbing the
British press.
It was written in 1644, as an explicit protest against an Order of
Parliament intended to confine all printed matter to government-licensed
presses. Many 'scandalous, seditious and libellous' works had been noted by
Members of Parliament, 'to the great defamation of religion and government'.
The legislation granted powers to the Stationers' Company to search for
unlicensed presses and destroy them. Milton's reply to this was cunning in
its rhetoric: he permeated his polemic with anti-Papal sentiments, likening
the government licensing system to the protocol of stamping a book with an
Imprimatur - 'let it be published' - and treating a grave subject with less
than Miltonic gravity. He made it appear as if the legislation were so
absurd that it caused even him, a committed moralist, to laugh.
Behind the rhetoric, however, is a core of good sense which deserves
rehearsal. The Areopagitica does not indulge the classic dilemma of
liberalism. That is, it accepts the natural company of both good and evil.
It does not propose a template of censorship where printed matter may be
judged either proper or improper.
Regulation is not a relative measure here. Government either controls the
press, or it does not. If it chooses to control, then it must be consistent.
Milton reminds us of Plato's system of enlightened guardians, who were
thorough in their regulation. They licensed not only people's reading
matter, but people's clothes, people's music, and even people's sex lives.
'Who shall regulate all the mixed conversation of our youth?' he demands.
The Platonic option translates into totalitarianism: that is why newspaper
editors have universally tagged the Calcutt deliberations as 'undemocratic.'
Milton is not an anarchist. He believes in standards. And he admits that
unlicensed printing results in the circulation of trash. But unlike Sir
David Calcutt, he is not prepared to countenance legislation against trash:
'I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue.'
From that, one may reasonably suppose that were Milton called to testify
today, he would prefer to see his monarchs plagued by paparazzi than place
themselves, in carefully chosen poses, before carefully chosen image-makers.
Agreed, that preference allows shoddiness, mud-slinging and 'inaccuracies' -
all the impurities to which Sir David Calcutt addressed himself - but it
also allows for truth to prevail over half-truth, for gold to outweigh
dross, and the preservation of justice.
The onus upon those who suffer attacks from unlicensed printing is not to
produce regulation, but persuasion. The false and the badly-researched will
reveal themselves, so long as the powers of selection remain with the
reading public, not the nabobs of some statutory council.
The Miltonic attitude may seem optimistic. But it was the same conclusion
reached by the Williams Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in 1979, and
Milton would be heartened by the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau
of Circulations, which detail newspaper sales for June until November last
year.
Taking into account the influence of the recession, there are clear signs of
tabloid decline. Not even an annus horribilis can sustain publications
dependent upon perpetual melodrama, it seems. But most heartening to
followers of Milton is the 18 per cent fall in sales of the Sunday Sport.
The initial success of this paper was immensely depressing to anyone with
the slightest moral intelligence: its six-month decline from 366,091 readers
from June 1 to 299,477 readers in November shows an appreciable upsurge in
discrimination from types one might otherwise have defined as cretins.
Acceptable levels of trash. That is what Milton argued for, not only as a
price worth paying for the preservation of the free spirit of enquiry, but
also as a sort of moral background noise. In his words: 'That which purifies
us is trial.' We recognise quality because we know what is bad; and we do
not need Sir David Calcutt, or anyone else, to tell us.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Gardening: 'Yes' to discrimination, 'no' to floral apartheid
 -Planning a border from scratch has its attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THESE amazing rains pour down, I have been looking to next season's
potential and pondering on a gap in every gardener's library.
Many books exist, but nobody has ever written the ideal book on how to
design a garden: what is the reason and what can be said meanwhile?
One reason is the variety of taste which changes in fashion soon complicate,
another is the extreme difficulty of being specific when readers have so
many different sites, soils and settings in their background. There is also
the problem of the illustration.
Drawings and plans cannot do justice to the changes of light and shade
during a day or a season. Photographs lie, although we have all been
inspired by them. They fix a particular light or a particular moment; they
cast a glamorous focus on one good feature.
Editors tend to print only those photographs which look seductive. Design is
also a difficult subject to describe. Books can be grand and lofty or woolly
and vague. The late Russell Page was a remarkable example of the former
style, rivalled by Sylvia Crowe in the latter.
Matters were not much better in the great age of Capability Brown and his
successors. I find that their historic writings suffer the same problems.
Without writing a book, I will try to avoid extremes and offer a few guiding
thoughts.
Before me stretches a newly-cleared border, blank like the human mind, in
the 17th century's imagery of one. How do I start thinking about it? I
always try to picture the final result in context. Will the design fit in?
Will it suit that phrase from the 18th century, 'the genius of the place',
and look good in its surroundings?
This habit of thought discourages pure borrowing. The wrong way to begin is
with something 'as seen at Sissinghurst' or in a photo of Tintinhull, to be
copied exactly in east Essex. Unlike foxgloves, other people's bright ideas
do not transplant anywhere. Straight plagiarism looks scrappy and
unconvincing, although photographs sometimes encourage it.
I will limit myself to some clear thoughts about borders. In a border, I
would always go mixed. Herbaceous borders and beds of nothing but roses are
too limited in form, season and texture: why not have some pale blue
ceanothus among musk roses or mock orange blossom in a bed of civilised
phloxes?
Shrubs give backbone, especially if they are evergreens, repeated at wide
intervals. My favourite hardy evergreen for this purpose is the
white-flowered osmarea burkwoodii, as nurseries describe it. In mild
districts, I would also use waxy green pittosporum. Several groups of each
divide a bigger border into sections which are much easier to visualise.
Even in a small garden, start with thoughts of backbone and then span the
boundaries by reading and plundering several chapters of sections in a
catalogue. You might even like to grow scarlet runner beans on tall stakes
for height in the back row.
Books and plans still encourage you to plant in blocks at a density of five
plants or more to a square yard. The density is impossibly expensive and I
would always prefer to buy one big plant for nearer Pounds 3 and split it
myself into pieces, growing them on carefully during their first year. I am
also against blocks.
The shrewd Miss Jekyll preferred the thinner shape of drifts which are
longer than broad. She felt, quite rightly, that drifts were less obtrusive
when out of season. This preference is evident in most of her border plans,
printed in her books or visible in facsimile in a garden shed at
Hestercombe, near Taunton in Somerset. I also like to scatter and repeat.
After the backbone, my thoughts always begin with a plant which I want to be
the main feature down a border or round a garden in any one fortnight. I
then repeat individual bits of it often enough to lead the eye in search of
it. Designers and their books underestimate this trick. Their schemes are
cluttered up with subtle theories of colour and heights.
Meanwhile, the eye will jump over a mass of stems out of season and head for
something which is directly in season. You can test this principle on any
garden-watchers who come to visit. They like to be able to say that the
sweet rocket is looking wonderful in early June or that the single pink rose
complicata is amazing in July. The eye must be drawn to something and then
led on by repetition so that it overlooks weaknesses and retains one instant
impression.
What about colour? My rule here is discrimination, but not floral apartheid.
I do not go for single coloured borders, all white or all purple. In very
large gardens, they can still be an amusing enclosure, but otherwise they
limit choice. Blues, yellows, pale pinks and whites form one group in my
mind's eye; all or some of them will combine very happily, provided that the
yellows are not too strong. Reds, whites, oranges and purples are another
group which need greater care but could still allow harmony or contrast.
If you are stuck at any point, turn to silver-leaved plants to help you out
of the problem. They combine with almost anything and take the edge off a
hard colour. As a general rule, strong colour is better near the back of a
wide bed. In the foreground, it arrests the eye and diminishes depth. Like
all rules, this one is all the better for being broken occasionally. But if
you break it too often and put all the ghostly colours at the back, you will
foreshorten the border's scale.
What, lastly, are the overriding values? For me, they are scent, season and
amiable elements of scattiness. If you are looking for scent, use a
specialised book, of which Scent in Your Garden by Stephen Lacey is a
helpful guide. Always use plants which have a longer season than a week or
so: as yet, there is no fully reliable guide in the UK, least of all the
nursery catalogues which imply that their plants will flower for many more
months than most of them do. Whenever I descend to detail, it is this value
of season which preoccupies me.  You can have three or more different
borders if you cultivate a sense of season and think of the space as a stage
on which different acts in succession will take the limelight.
As for scattiness, you already have the drift of it. Be formal, but not too
formal when planting and distributing flowers. You should cultivate an
artful air of wilderness and aim for that moment when gardens look as if
they are just about to run out of control. You see why good design is the
subject with so few classics: I know this quality when I see it, but I
cannot quite describe it specifically. Perhaps it is like theology. The
Unauthorised Border: there, perhaps, is the title which might have the
properly scatty scope.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Travel: The hunters with feathers in their caps - Nicholas
Woodsworth follows the trail of a band of big-game enthusiasts in the Alps
and asks: is it right to kill animals for fun?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERCHED on a ridge amid gloomy stands of pine, the little hamlet of Unter
Gosing is not the easiest of places to get to. It sits in the isolated
Otscherland, in a part of Lower Austria where the Alps break up into steep,
thickly-wooded hills before tailing off into the broad plains of eastern
Europe.
Foresters, loggers and small-scale hill farmers live in its valleys. Its
upper reaches have a different population - they are much favoured by
mountain chamois, moufflon, roebuck, red stag, and the men who hunt them.
To get there I had left the comforts of the Danube and driven high into the
hills through the towns of Ybbs, Scheibbs and Puchenstuben. The wilder the
names became, the wilder the country too. Up I snaked through steep-sided
valleys, towards a blanket of autumn mist. By the time I pulled up outside
the Gosing Alpenkurhotel in the late afternoon, the mist was curling through
pine forests below me; I felt as if I had arrived at the end of the Earth.
Could this be the right hotel? Surely not, I thought. I was in the
Otscherland because I was interested in Austrian stag-hunting, much reputed
among that shrinking band of enthusiasts still enthralled by guns and big
game. But where were the hunters?
There were elderly gentlemen wrapped in fluffy white towels shuffling in and
out of sauna-rooms. There were stainless steel dispensers marked
'nerve-tee'. There were doors marked 'colon-hydrotherapie'. None of this
immediately suggested unbounded machismo and the simple pleasures of the
great outdoors. Could hunting, under the scourge of eco-protectionists,
greens, anti-vivisectors and others have become quite this limp?
The spa-like atmosphere changed dramatically not long after sunset when a
small fleet of four-wheel-drive Toyota pick-up trucks crunched to a halt
outside. The men who got out were definitely not health-curists, but neither
did they measure up to my image of hairy-chested hunters.
Apart from the rifles they cradled, they were dressed from head to toe in
that rich tyrolean colour, halfway between olive drab and forest green, that
is peculiar to the German-speaking Alps. They wore long socks and buckled
knee breeches, elegant jackets with silver buttons, long felt capes, and
tyrolean hats with silky plumes and braided hat-bands. I had never seen
hunters like these.
More convincing was the large stag that lay dead in the back of one of the
vehicles. I gazed at its ruddy-brown coat, sniffed its pungent zoo smell,
fingered the antlers that rose a good 3 feet above its skull. Somewhat
guiltily, I avoided the trusting liquid brown eyes that had stayed open: no
matter what Hemingway says, wild animals do not remain beautiful even in
death.
I may have felt guilty, but not guilty enough to avoid the game pate and
venison with cranberry sauce offered on the hotel game menu that evening.
Surrounded by hunters now busy quaffing beer, downing rich red meat and
swapping hunting stories, I discussed my own stag-hunting plans with
Octavian Gassaver, the hotel's owner and an avid hunter.
Is hunting barbaric, a slaughter of defenseless animals by inadequate
individuals? Or, more nobly, is it part of the larger cycle of life and
death in the natural world, an age-old survival instinct buried deep in
man's culture? These were not questions Herr Gassaver asked me directly. He
merely wanted to know whether I preferred to come along as an observer or
wanted to carry a rifle and hunt.
Simple questions invite more difficult ones, though, and I found myself
hesitating, for I have never been able to come down firmly on one side or
the other of that most emotive of issues, the morality of blood sports. I am
both attracted and repelled by them, and that is why they interest me.
Stalking and killing a large wild animal is both exciting and senseless. Is
there such a thing as civilised hunting, or is that a contradiction of
terms?
My first inclination was to believe that it was all rather nasty. Take
stag-hunting. When my host told me I would have a good chance of shooting a
stag, I asked him why. 'To shoot a stag you must find a stag, and this is
not easy', he told me in his rough and ready English. 'The best way is to
hear it cry. And when does it cry? When it is in love.'
Herr Gassaver, I finally realised, was referring to the rutting season.
Autumn is the time of year when stags lose their caution, come into the open
and try to attract females with loud and desperate-sounding mating calls.
My moral problem eased itself the moment I asked how much the fees would be.
They vary, I found out, according to a complex formula of length, weight,
size and shape applied not to the stag itself - the animal is not the final
object of the hunt - but to its horns.
What about the stag in the back of the truck, I asked. I tried to picture
horns like that hanging on my dining room wall. About 180 points, Herr
Gassaver suggested. That would cost something over Pounds 5,000 in trophy
fees, which did not include 20 per cent VAT. In hunting as in most theatres
of life, economics usually push moral considerations out of the picture. I
retired to bed with my conscience clear; I would just watch the early
morning hunt.
I was woken at 3.30am and 30 minutes later was sitting in the back of a
Toyota beside Asta, a prized red Bavarian bloodhound. In the front were
Christian Kupfer - her master and the Alpenkur's head-hunting guide - and
Didier Hugot, his client.
Off we bounced through the forest on dirt roads, down the mountainside,
along a narrow valley, then high up the opposite ridge. The weather was
abysmal. As we drove through the dark our headlights cut through a steady
fall of rain. Nevertheless, Didier Hugot, an extroverted company executive
from Paris, was up-beat. Hunting, he told me, was no fun if it was too easy.
The next few hours were not easy, but neither were they a lot of fun. We
stopped the truck in a clearing and stepped out into cold rain. In the pitch
black I could barely make out my companions beside me, much less the steep
and heavily-wooded hillside.
Christian allowed us not a single word, nor the smallest sliver of light.
How he and Hugot climbed blind through a forest without making any noise
mystified me. My own small achievement lay in smothering foul oaths - within
five minutes I had banged into a tree, smacked my ankle against a rock, and
nose-dived into a small and muddy stream. By the time we arrived,
half-an-hour later, at a small hunting blind, I had begun to feel that the
anti-hunting brigade was right: this was a cruel sport.
And there we sat, waiting. The rain fell and the light lifted. Occasionally
raising binoculars to their eyes, the two hunters kept their eyes roving
over the dim grey space ahead. Asta dozed. My bottom was numb, my foot went
to sleep. I dripped. Nobody spoke, nothing happened; 6 am came and went.
There were no disconsolate mating calls, no love-lorn stags. Finally
Christian had to admit defeat - rain was keeping the stags in the shelter of
the forest. We trudged away.
I felt disappointed. Didier Hugot, on the other hand, did not. There is much
more to hunting, he told me, than the kill. He estimated that for every stag
he has shot he has put in 30 hours of hill climbing, stalking, or just
waiting. I asked him why he came such a long way to spend so much money for
such hard-earned results. Was there no hunting in France?
Of course there was, he replied. 'But hunting here has nothing to do with
hunting at home. In France, especially the South, we blast anything that
moves. It is complete anarchy.'
In Austria it was different, Hugot said. Here, as in Germany and
Switzerland, there was a discipline, a strong and much-cherished hunting
tradition. Teutonic hunting culture dated from the Middle Ages when the
hunting of 'high game' like deer, roebuck and chamois (as opposed to 'low
game' such as hare and fowl) was the privilege of the wealthy land-owning
class.
Austrian society may be more democratic today, but noble hunting traditions
persist. Every hunter subjects himself to a strict code of behaviour. He
takes years to build the knowledge he needs to pass an Austrian hunting
licence exam.
'Look how hunters in Austria dress', Hugot said, indicating his own cape and
clothes. 'In everything they do there is a style and an attitude that gives
value to hunting. This is what counts. I did not kill a stag today. What
does it matter? It is the ambience, the ethic that is important. The final
act, pulling the trigger, is almost irrelevant.'
Didier Hugot had not displayed a blood-thirsty,
smoking-barrel-and-spent-shot machismo. He had not come remotely close to
shooting a stag. But he had thoroughly enjoyed himself. Even I, crashing
about on the hillside and with no qualifications to wear tyrolean green, had
enjoyed myself. Austrian hunting is an expensive, esoteric art in which the
means seem to count as much as the ends.
I did see one more stag before leaving Gosing, or at least part of one. I
watched Christian Kupfer outside his forest chalet boiling a stag's head in
a metal drum to remove its flesh before sawing away its frontal bone and
horns. It was not a terribly pretty sight. Sometimes hunting is a cruel and
barbaric practice. But I am more tempted now to believe it can also be a
civilised sport.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Fashion: Full pelt into the world of fakes - Lucia van der
Post says today's array of synthetic furs means animal magnetism is not just
skin-deep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE WHO has ever shrugged their way into a real fur can feel at once that
it is warm, glamorous, sexy and, as if many women needed any further
persuasion, it lasts almost forever.
But, outside the frozen tundras of Alaska and Siberia where wearing fur
could be said to be essential for survival, there has always been another,
hidden cost - the aura of the idle rich, of Hollywood excess, the faint hint
of the kept woman and, in more recent times, of being unaware, uncaring,
spoilt.
Since those long-gone days when Elinor Glyn desported herself so exuberantly
on a tiger skin, attitudes have changed - real fur may be softer, warmer,
longer-lasting, a better investment (and it is all of those things), but, by
and large, most of us prefer not to wear it. Some do not dare, some
genuinely do not want to and others cannot afford it.
The good news, though, is that the alternatives get better and better. Fake
fur used to look stiff, garish and - not to mince words - just a bit common.
Modern fibres and mixtures, as well as new ways of treating the fibres, mean
that the latest generation of fake-fur fabrics are softer, warmer and
infinitely more appealing than their predecessors.
They take colour better - prints can be soft and subtle, like the smudgy
grey and black hooded duffle coat (above) or deliberately, flauntingly bold
and eye-catching like Sportmax's glamorous car-coat (above, right). Some ape
the real thing alarmingly realistically, others home in on strange and
unearthly mutations of leopard, panther, cheetah, tiger, ocelet.
Above all, though, the appeal of the furry numbers featured here is that
they are nearly (but not, it has to be admitted, quite) as warm, as cuddly,
and as glamorous as their natural counterparts - but all are a great deal
cheaper.
If a full coat is not what you are looking for, a range of sumptuous
accessories in fake fur has arrived in the shops this winter. Jilly Forge,
for instance, in her own shop at 14 Addison Avenue, London W11, has some
long fur-cuffed gauntlets, silk-lined, in chocolate, white, light brown or
black at Pounds 70 a pair that would add panache to almost any outfit. She
has a big range of warm, soft squashy hats in almost every shape and colour,
from chocolate and light brown to black and white (prices range around
Pounds 65), as well as muffs (Pounds 65) and velcro-fastening fur-collars
(Pounds 70) which could add instant glamour.
At Fenwick of 63 New Bond Street, London W1, there are some adaptable 'fur'
pieces in mottled-grey animal print which can be used to glamorise gloves,
coats (add them as cuffs) or the tops of boots. At Pounds 19.95 a pair, they
are a bit of fun to cheer up a grim January or February day.
If you still have not bought a winter coat and are thinking that perhaps a
fake fur is the answer, Fenwick has the most reasonably-priced classy
version fake I have seen - once Pounds 259, now reduced to Pounds 199, it
features a soft grey cat print and is cosy enough to see you through any
number of chilly winter days.
Finally, anybody out and about on the high streets will have noticed that
the fad for jungle prints has strayed far beyond just coats - from T-shirts
and leggings to Versace's much-photographed (particularly on the Duchess of
York) silk blazer; versions, some chic, some kitsch, are everywhere. You
could buy an outrageous body or a chiffon shirt, a simple scarf or a
luxuriously soft twinset such as the one here from Laura B.
You could pay as little as Pounds 12.99 for leggings (at C&amp;A, which has a
complete feline collection of its own) or several hundreds for a Versace
jacket. The main thing to remember is that animal prints may be fun, a bit
of tongue-in-cheek, but they are dangerously easy to over do. If in doubt,
do not don more than one spotted number at a time and keep the background
colours to grey or black or brown.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Fashion: Or is it just a silly fashion? - Fake fur is a bad
answer to the wrong questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE ALL politically correct notions, the idea of fake fur flies in the face
of reality.
It is neither warm nor soft, it is not lasting, and it looks no more like
fur than the Maastricht Treaty looks like a victory for Britain. As with all
such notions, no one really believed in it even when it was at its most
fashionable.
A decade of anti-fur campaigning has transformed the ostentatious wearing of
fur - but not leather, which is just skins with the fur removed - into a
political issue. In the early 1980s, fur shops were sporadically fire-bombed
and vandalised. Fur farming came under attack. Harrods closed its legendary
fur salon in 1989 because insurance costs became prohibitive, and scores of
other furriers shut down in a climate of fear.
Sensational anti-fur advertising campaigns, featuring outrageously
misogynist images equating women with bloodied quarry 'Rich Bitch, Poor
Bitch', have encouraged verbal abuse - 'it took 13 dumb animals to make this
coat and only one to wear it' - and even physical attacks on women wearing
fur. Terrorist methods apparently failed to alienate public opinion which
was exposed to absurd allegations which still abound. They range from
rumours of subsidies to farms where animals are allegedly gassed, so that
clean pelts can be obtained, to ridiculous reports that fur traders prowl
the streets to capture cats.
Just as there was no concerted resistance to the terrorist tactics, there
has been no effective defence of freedom of choice in the wearing of furs.
In spite of its similarity to quests to abolish, for example, smoking, fox
hunting or all-male clubs, the anti-fur campaign never aroused moral
indignation in the press, nor a disgruntled murmur at the Tory Party
Conference.
Fur was finished off but by women's magazines and fashion writers who
pronounced it to be 'out of fashion'.
They did what the anti-fur campaigners had not been able to achieve on their
own. Some decided to boycott fur altogether; others decided against
coverage.
In 1991, the suggestion of writing about fur was greeted at a Tatler
editorial conference with gasps: 'Real fur?' and a firm reproach that 'our
readers don't like fur and they don't wear it'. But in September last year
that editorial policy was reversed. By December, even Vogue and The Daily
Telegraph had caught up with the latest consensus.
If all this seems like some inexplicable conspiracy theory, then the
question to ask is Cui bono? The answer is, of course, the women's magazines
and fashion pundits themselves. Their gripe against fur is more than
skin-deep.
Their social discontent arises from tantalising proximity to the truly rich,
while they themselves are merely well-heeled; from following fashion they
can rarely afford.
Their attack on fur is a test of their ability to manipulate trends: for
fashion is only a powerful weapon so long as it can be defined as more the
possession of intangible knowledge than of tangible things.
So it was that we have had the trend for all things fake - fake pearls, less
than genuine bosoms, and, of course, synthetic furs. The object? To devalue,
if not to expropriate, what is real.
It is not the rich who lose out. Those who can afford it can wear what they
want, and if they no longer want fur they can indulge some other whim
without the least hardship. For the rich, anyway, fashion is an amusement,
and the more drastically it changes the more amusing it is. The poor are
also immune - unless they happen to work in the fur industry.
The ones who lose out are somewhere in between. For such people, fur is a
well-considered investment: rather like a Savile Row suit. It transcends
fashion and it is a symbol of independence. And it is this which the
arbiters of style cannot abide.
Yet this year we are told that fur is back in fashion. Fur trims and
accessories are in the collections, and it is all right to wear fur as a
transient, authorised adornment. The debate has less to do with being
sympathetic to animals than pursuing novelty and pleasing editors.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Wine: Worthwhile Californian selections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER happens, California's best wines, which (unlike most from the New
World) have real distinction and subtlety, are unlikely to get any cheaper.
Morris &amp; Verdin of London SW1 (tel: 071-630-8888) import one of the UK's
most interesting selections, including Au Bon Climat and Bonny Doon's
deliberately quirky range. Bibendum of London NW1 (071-722 5577) and of York
(0423-330131) also try harder than most, with Chalk Hill, Saintsbury, and
Kistler's divine 1990 McCrea Chardonnay actually worth the premier cru
price, Pounds 17.50,
asked for it. The Wine Treasury of London SW1 (071-730-6774) also imports
Kistler and Williams-Selyem's famous Pinot Noir. Bonny Doon, Mt Eden,
Rochioli Pinot Noir and Joseph Swan Zinfandel are available from Raeburn
Fine Wines of Edinburgh (031-332-5166). Ridge, Chalone, Edna Valley and
Mondavi are available from Les Amis du Vin, London W1 (071-487-3419) while
John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727-6846) has Ravenswood Zinfandel.
Meanwhile, Oddbins are committed to nosing out California bargains.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Cookery: For financiers who are serious about eating .  .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE IN a while, it is a challenge to cook a seriously luxurious recipe, if
only to keep one's hand in. Hence Riz a la Financiere, my simplified version
of a classic.
The original is a very grand dish of sweetbreads blanched then larded with
strips of bacon and studded with pieces of truffle, tongue and ham  - a
little slice of a lot of good things. The prepared sweetbreads are then
braised, garnished with quenelles of veal fillet or chicken, cockscombs,
kidneys, mushrooms and truffles, cloaked in a Madeira sauce with truffles
and cream, and served in a puff pastry vol-au-vent. Phew.
However, the classic dish is not really fit for modern consumption, even by
financiers. Veal sweetbreads are scarce and cost nearly Pounds 10 per lb, so
I have changed the principal ingredient from sweetbreads to rice, an
economical move from ris to riz.
I have also excluded cockscombs - even Harrods does not stock them. The
humble lamb's tongue, the texture of which is said to be similar, can be
used instead.
Fillet of pork can replace fillet of veal, and lamb kidneys can stand in for
calves' kidneys. As for fungi, truffles, porcini or ordinary cultivated
mushrooms can be used, or a mixture of all three. Not all these ingredients
are necessary, but beware too many exclusions or you will end up with only a
bowl of rice.
The rice could be all white, virginal pure, or wild rice with shavings of
truffle, as black as sin, depending on how far into the red you are prepared
to take your bank balance. And the sauce must be rich.
RIZ A LA FINANCIERE OR BANKER'S RICE (serves 8)
The ingredients and workload which follow look daunting but the good news is
that all the cooking can be done ahead. Rather to my surprise, I found that
even the meats reheat well - providing they are reheated gently in some of
the sauce in a tightly covered dish in a hot water bath in a moderate oven.
At least 2lb of meats are needed, ideally 10 oz of each of four different
sorts, as listed below. If one type of meat is unobtainable, use just three
varieties, increasing the weight accordingly, or replace the missing item
with chicken livers.
For the meats and fungi: 8-10 oz veal or lamb sweetbreads; 8-10 oz lamb's
tongues; 8-10 oz veal fillet (or pork fillet or chicken breast); 8-10 oz
veal or lamb kidneys;  1/2 oz dried porcini (optional); 8oz cap mushrooms,
preferably so-called chestnut mushrooms; unsalted or clarified butter for
frying; shavings of truffle or sprigs of watercress to garnish.
For the sauce: 12 fl oz Madeira; 2 shallots, finely chopped; a nut of
butter; 2-3 sprigs of thyme;  3/4 pt good veal or chicken stock (or 1/2 pt
veal or chicken stock plus  1/4 pt of the liquid saved from soaking dried
porcini); the finely chopped stalks of the fresh mushrooms; 1-2 tablespoons
chopped celery leaves; beurre manie made by mashing together 1 1/2
tablespoons each softened butter and plain flour;  1/2 -1 teaspoon La
Truffata (a blend of truffle and porcini puree available from delicatessens,
Waitrose and selected branches of Sainsbury); a little lemon juice; 4-6
tablespoons double cream.
For the rice: 12 oz long grain white rice plus 4 oz wild rice (or whatever
ratio of wild to white your bank balance suggests); minced black truffle or
a splash of truffle juice (optional); 1-2 tablespoons lightly toasted sesame
seeds; butter.
First prepare the meats. Soak the sweetbreads in cold salt water for a
couple of hours. Cover with fresh salt water, bring to the boil and simmer
for two minutes. Plunge in cold water for five minutes then peel away
membrane and connective tissue so the sweetbreads can be separated into
smaller sections.
Soak the tongue for one hour in cold water with a squeeze of lemon juice.
Bring to the boil in fresh cold salt water or stock and simmer gently for 50
minutes or until tender. Plunge in cold water, remove skin, gristle and
excess fat from the base of the tongue. When cold, slice thinly.
Cut the veal fillet (or pork fillet or chicken breast meat) into quills.
Core the kidneys and cut into bite size pieces. (Lamb kidneys are best
soaked in milk for an hour before coring and slicing - save the milk for an
appreciative cat.) If using chicken livers, clean them and cut into lobes.
Put each sort of meat as soon as prepared into a separate bowl, cover and
keep cool until ready to cook.
If using dried porcini, soak them in about 7 fl oz warm water. When softened
and swollen, drain them and reserve. Strain their flavoursome liquid
carefully and save it for making the sauce. Trim the stalks from the fresh
mushrooms, chop finely and save for the sauce.
To make the sauce, first put the Madeira into a pan with the butter,
shallots and thyme, and boil down to about 5 tablespoons. Add the mushroom
stalks, celery leaves, some pepper and the stock. Cover and simmer for 20
minutes or so. Then strain, pressing the solids to extract every drop of
their flavour.
Reheat and thicken the sauce lightly by stirring in gradually small nuggets
of the beurre manie. Blend in the Truffata puree mixed with the cream and
season with lemon, salt and pepper to taste.
For the rice, first cook the white and wild rices in fast boiling salted
water until just cooked. Give the wild rice 15-20 minutes head start as it
takes longer than white rice to become tender. Drain, add knobs of butter,
season well and stir in the minced truffle or truffle juice if using it.
Spread the rice out to cool it.
Then spoon it into a large ring mould tin that has been thickly buttered and
lined with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Pack the rice well down into the
tin, pressing it firmly with the back of the spoon. The more neatly it
follows the curve of the tin, the easier it will be to unmould.
Cover the rice with a foil lid and reheat in the oven when required,
allowing 20 minutes at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6. (Or if reheating the meats
as well, use a lower oven temperature and bake for longer, placing both the
rice mould and the dish of meats in a hot water bath to protect against
drying out.)
When ready to cook the meats, first saute the fresh mushrooms in a little
very hot butter, remove and keep hot. Add more butter to the pan and saute
the meats: first the veal fillet, next the kidneys, then the chicken livers
if using them. Finally, add the sweetbreads, tongue and porcini and cook for
a few minutes more, stirring and turning the ingredients frequently.
Deglaze the pan with a few spoonfuls of water. Stir the meaty syrup into the
Madeira sauce and add any juices from the mushrooms. Then spoon enough sauce
over the meat mixture to coat it lightly.
To serve, unmould the rice onto a large flat dish, pile the meats into the
centre of the barricade and arrange the mushrooms in a ring round the edge.
Grate fresh truffle over them if your budget permits. Bring to the table
with sauceboats of hot Madeira sauce.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Wine: California's double whammy - Viruses which poses a new
threat to US west coast vines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY this time of year, nurseryman Rich Kunde of Sonoma Grapevines would
usually have grafted more than half a million vines for sale to California's
grape growers. This year, he has not grafted a single one.
This is despite the fact that demand for young vine cuttings in California
has never been greater. Because of the predations of a new strain of
phylloxera, the plant louse which devastated the vineyards of Europe and
beyond a century ago, Californians are engaged in a big vineyard replanting
programme. The only known deterrent to the insect is to graft vines on to
phylloxera-resistant rootstocks. The AxR-1 rootstocks, on which the
California wine industry is dependent, have been productive but not
resistant enough.
Some forecasts say the majority of vineyards in Napa and Sonoma,
California's most famous wine regions, will have to be completely replanted
over the next decade. But Kunde knows something so serious that, as he puts
it, it could be 'a tidal wave that will make the phylloxera thing look like
a little ripple'.
For decades, Davis, the University of California wine research centre, has
prided itself as the world's prime source of virus-free vine cuttings from
its solid-sounding Foundation Plant Materials Service. Virus diseases have
throughout history wreaked almost as much damage as phylloxera on the
world's vineyards. Fanleaf is bad but the worst is leafroll virus, probably
caused by a group of viruses, which can halve yields but also slows ripening
so that the resultant wines are thin and tart.
Leafroll's chief symptom is visible only on some varieties and only during
the autumn, when leaves of certain red wine vines may turn over on
themselves and take on deceptively beautiful autumnal colours. It is
particularly difficult to detect because on some varieties, and all
rootstocks (essential for California's phylloxera-resistant replanting
programme), there are no visible symptoms at all.
For years, it has been taught, and believed, that leafroll can be spread
only by using cuttings from infected plants. But last summer, the FPMS at
Davis began testing the all-important 'mother vines' for leafroll, using the
sophisticated ELISA technique developed in the early 1980s. This was to
ensure that the millions of cuttings released to vine growers all over the
world each year really are virus-free.
The plant pathologist found to his horror that about 20 per cent of some
batches tested positive, even though they had been selected from apparently
virus-free plants.
The situation progressed from sleepless nights to shared knowledge to task
forces to decisions and, on December 16, the FPMS issued a letter explaining
why they had stopped issuing plant material, admitting that the virus seems
to be spreading through their supposedly virus-free Foundation Vineyard and
they have not a clue how.
This rather elliptical communication, however, may still be languishing at
the bottom of various holiday in-trays. The real showdown will take place
this Tuesday at a meeting with California nurserymen and grape growers.
They are confused enough already by what they call the latent virus
phenomenon, whereby cuttings taken from vines that performed superbly when
grafted on to AxR-1 rootstocks, show horrible virus symptoms now that they
are being grafted on to phylloxera-resistant rootstocks. Not to mention the
nasty Pierce's disease for which there is no known cure and which is a
particular problem in southern California and in some Napa vineyards.
Not that leafroll spread has come out of the blue. Some observers had
noticed leafroll in the Davis vineyards some time ago, but it was not taken
seriously. Leafroll had also appeared in New Zealand's National Foundation
Vineyard, made up of cuttings imported from Davis, some years back. But
again, it was ignored because everyone believed leafroll could only be
spread from infected vines and these were vines guaranteed by Davis to be
virus-free. In Taiwan, another FPMS client had noticed strange patterns of
virus spread too, as had some growers in Europe and South Africa, it now
emerges.
Although no one knows how the virus is spreading, and a definitive answer
within less than a few years seems unlikely, a vector, an insect perhaps, is
implicated. Mealy bug is currently the prime suspect.
Leafroll is not only difficult to spot, it is impossible to cure.
Californians who have just replanted a vineyard after the predations of
phylloxera now cannot be sure that they have not, in fact, planted virused
vines and/or virused rootstocks which will have to pulled up again when,
after a further three years or so, they can monitor the vines' performance.
International viticultural consultant Dr Richard Smart has already advised
clients in Australia as well as California to pull out any vines showing
signs of leafroll, especially if mealy bug is present - unwelcome advice
when vines are expected to produce for up to 30 years but take three years
to establish in the vineyard.
What a blow to an industry that so recently looked so rosy. For the moment,
growers may be paralysed and nurseryman such as Kunde can do little other
than hope that it was ELISA at fault all along. Instead of grafting new
cuttings for sale, he is currently instituting painstaking tracking systems
whereby every cutting he has sold can be traced right back to its source.
Warren Winiarski of Stag's Leap, one of Napa's most viticulturally aware
wine producers, said: 'There is now a great deal of uncertainty about how
rapidly we can go forward with this replanting programme. We may move out of
the phylloxera frying pan into the fire of these viruses, Pierce's disease
and so on.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Food: Lunch for a fiver - ready for take-off / The latest
updates on the Weekend FT's eating out scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INKLING that 'Lunch for a Fiver' was going to be a success occurred when
my phone rang at 9.30am on Monday. It was the man who handles public
relations for one of the best-known Park Lane hotels. 'Was it too late,' he
wondered, 'for the hotel to be included in the scheme?'
This year we had to disappoint, but such has been the response and interest
that any future schemes which we plan will try to satisfy more restaurateurs
and hoteliers and even more customers.
This week's list of restaurants includes several small amendments to that
which appeared last Saturday. Firstly, the FT's computer list omitted one
restaurant entirely, 192 of 192 Kensington Park Road, London W11 2JF
(071-229-0482), which is not open for lunch on Mondays. The omission was
particularly ironic since a letter from 192's managing director, Tony
Mackintosh, had been one of the first, enthusiastic responses.
It read: 'Of course we are in for your scheme. Great idea. Hope it is a huge
success.'
Then the owners of Daphne's in Draycott Avenue, London SW3, phoned to say
that builders who were working there would still be on the premises on
January 18 and that, therefore, it would have to withdraw. So if you live in
that area try instead Walton's or Turner's, both just around the corner in
Walton Street.
To keep the same number of participating restaurants, I am pleased to add Le
Cafe des Amis du Vin, 11-14 Hanover Place, Covent Garden, London WC2, (tel
071-379-3444). One change of nationality over the New Year: the Machino
Japanese Restaurant has become the Young Bin Kwan Korean restaurant.
One Chelsea restaurateur, Tom Benham of Monkeys, SW3, reported that although
bookings were excellent, some of his callers were asking whether bread rolls
were included in the Pounds 5 and what was the price of his mineral water.
Fortunately, this seems to be an isolated case of mean-mindedness. Overall,
readers have responded with warm enthusiasm to the restaurant trade's answer
to the January sales.
Brian Clivaz, general manager of Simpson's in-the-Strand, reported that
within three days he had received 365 bookings and that some of those
booking 'Lunch for a Fiver' had at the same time booked tables for when the
scheme was not running simply because they were on the phone.
One restaurant in the City started its Pounds 5 lunch four days early to
meet demand while Adlard's, in Norwich, Norfolk, was booked out for the
entire two weeks by Thursday last week. Carlton Television, London's new
regional station, is planning to feature the scheme and interview several
participating restaurants during the coming week.
And so far there has been only one disappointed customer. A friend, an
excellent cook and a woman with a slim waist but a wonderful appetite, faxed
me to say that with business lunches at Pounds 5, she felt she could justify
the cost of the flight from Boston, in the US, to London. Sadly, she could
not persuade the company president to let her come.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Money for rope for man who makes
ends meet - Des Pawson who has turned his passion for knots into a business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW MANY suppliers can create business simply through the aroma of their
catalogue? Des Pawson can. One valued regular customer sits in his office
high above Wall Street with the Footrope Knots brochure handy enough to
sniff.
Instead of staples, the 16-page publication is stitched with tarred marlin.
This heavy twine used in traditional ropework is treated with Stockholm tar
and has a smell evocative enough to bring the square-riggers back to life.
Pawson believes he is the only business in the world tying knots, teaching
knots, writing about knots and selling other enthusiasts the means to pursue
their hobby.
From his office/warehouse/home in Ipswich emerges a steady stream of turks-
heads, monkey fists, rope mats and all sorts of intricate ropework and
netting. Equipment ranging from marlin spikes to The History of Knot Theory
(translated from the Danish) leaves by every post.
Pawson, a bearded cheery man with a matelot's patter, has also been used as
an expert consultant by Surrey police pursuing a murder inquiry. Knots used
to tie the victim yielded valuable clues to detectives.
'I've loved knots and been fascinated by them since I was a little boy,'
explained Pawson, 46. 'But the difference between me and amateur tiers is
that I've always had a financial interest.
'When I was 11 I used to buy cord and turn them into fancy woggles for other
Scouts and sell them at a profit. I've always believed my skill had a
value.'
Rather than running away to sea, after leaving school he spent five years
working in Harrods furniture department. Pawson says it taught him all his
basic skills of stock management, salesmanship and cash flow. He later put
this background to use in running a Pounds 1m a year business for an East
Anglian office supplies company.
All the while he was developing his hobby towards being a fully-fledged
business which could support him and his wife Liz - two grown-up sons are at
college. The first significant order was in 1968 for three dozen braided
bell ropes for Captain O M Watts, the Mayfair chandler.
Like many crafts-people faced with volume orders, he began using outworkers
for routine tasks. 'I realised that with the ultimate niche market, I was
going to have to do more than tie knots myself all day - even if I had
wanted to,' Pawson said.
Ten years ago he was one of the founding members of the International Guild
of Knot Tyers. From an initial 20 or so members it has grown to over 600,
with subscribers in every large country. Faced with an audience of this size
Pawson resolved to become the leading supplier of scarce materials for the
enthusiast.
The large shed at the foot of his garden is a paradise for anyone who has
ever loved the feel and smell of traditional rope. Coils of manilla, hemp
and sisal fill the floor. Racks of shackles, fids and spikes line the
benches. Pawson often has to track down materials from such arcane sources
as French Navy surplus auctions.
'The problem is that I sometimes have to buy enough to last five years. The
opportunity is that I'm the only person around who has got some of this
stuff,' he said, while illustrating the arcane merits of differently
balanced marlin spikes.
Fellow knotters are encouraged to visit. Often they are 'dropping by' en
route to some serious business meeting but the lure of Pawson's wondrous
shed proves too much for them.
His has two business tenets. He never borrows money and, from the earliest
hobby days, he has made tax returns. Pawson says the first rule kept his
feet on the ground and prevented things growing beyond their economic base,
the second reminded him that it really was a business, however small. In the
early days there was no tax to pay.
Nowadays, he says, Footrope Knots is turning over slightly more than Pounds
25,000 a year, with very low overheads. For the first time, Pawson will be
running a knotting summer school at Suffolk College. He also writes Rope
Yarns, a regular feature in The Boatman magazine.
Strong interest in the restoration of classic yachts has helped business. He
is often called upon to recreate fenders and the like from sources such as
Edwardian photographs. He feels the call of the sea himself and enjoys
sailing a modest traditional Dutch scow.
Pawson has a stand at the London Boat Show which closes tomorrow and has
been demonstrating his skills. 'It's more of a promotional exercise than a
retail one for me,' he said. 'But a lot of the people I meet and give cards
to will become customers during the year.
'However, the knotting business is far bigger than just boats. It appeals to
all kinds of people who never go near the sea. It's to do with tradition and
texture.'
The Boat Show at Earls Court, London, is open today and tomorrow, 10 am-7pm.
The Footrope Knots catalogue is available for 68p from 501 Wherstead Rd,
Ipswich, Suffolk, IP2 8LL. Tel: 0473 690090.

FT  16 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: The sex therapist and the shopping
trolley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH QUESTIONS of scandal and privacy echoing around the papers it is worth
noting how relative these things are: one nation's political scandal is
another nation's bore. In recent weeks Britain, France, and Germany have had
to face frightful revelations about their politicians. Italy does not count
since politicians there are expected to be frightful, and Italian newspapers
could not cope with the various Lamont 'scandals.'
The fact that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had inadvertently
rented his house to a 'sex therapist' was amusing enough, but the row over
his acceptance of a Treasury offer of a mere Pounds 4,000, which did not go
into his pocket anyway, was incomprehensible. The subsequent farcical
developments, involving the publication of his credit card account and
untrue stories relating to purchases of cheap champagne and cigarettes
ensured that all foreign interest evaporated.
And so to the tedium of the influence-peddling scandals in Germany. The
latest concerns the housing minister, Irmgard Schwaetzer, and a property
company, Germania. In a contribution to its house magazine the minister
seemed to be promoting the firm's interests. Earlier, the economics
minister, Jurgen Mollemann, had to resign because he had tried to help out
his wife's cousin over the matter of a patent on a supermarket trolley.
Because of their sublime banality, these typically German affairs attracted
little comment outside the country.
The only real horror story in this litany was the French blood contamination
affair. This involved hundreds of haemophiliacs who were infected with the
AIDS virus through state-run blood transfusions. French scandals have
considerable bearing on the current debate in Britain on the role of the
press. It is proposed, among other things, that there should be legal limits
on invasions of privacy.
The editor of the Sunday Times, Andrew Neill, said this would make Britain
like France, where, he elegantly argued, 'privacy laws have intimidated
newspapers from doing investigative journalism and made them poodles of the
political establishment.'
Maybe in the blood scandal the press could have acted sooner - but once the
story was rolling the media made a substantial contribution. The papers also
did some fine work on the blowing up of the Rainbow Warrior by French
security agents in New Zealand; the Pechiney share dealing racket would not
have emerged but for the work of the French press and Le Monde took on the
Socialist Party by helping to expose corruption there. French poodles even
bite their friends.
Their record compares favourably with the British bulldogs. It was not
heroic newspaper reporters who first shed light on the Guinness, BCCI,
Maxwell and Matrix-Churchill affairs. In France a restrictive law on
privacy, which allows 'public interest' as a defence, combines with a system
that makes libel cheap. This combination can help the press, if it is
interested in important matters rather than trivia - partly because it
discourages libel actions which perforce involve the plaintiff sacrificing
the otherwise guaranteed right of privacy.
Under the French system, means newspapers are fined if they reveal details
of the colours of the football team in which the minister of culture is
alleged to make love to his mistress. And they cannot publish pictures of
even English duchesses disporting themselves with their financial advisers
in a manner that falls short of the chaste standards that characterise the
English aristocracy. What they can do is to say that Monsieur Farfelu is a
crook and have a fair chance of getting away with it. In Britain the
situation is exactly the reverse thanks to the extraordinary strictness of
the libel laws which shield the guilty as well as the innocent and various
bits of secrecy legislation.
That has helped to ensure that the British debate on press freedom has
concentrated on the Royal Family for that is the story that is at risk. In
the great British theme park, the dream of happy royal marriages was
fabricated by the media and the royal press office. So when, as is now the
case, they turn out to be in the traditional mould there is a colossal row
which can, some say, lead to the destruction of the House of Windsor.
Had the press not connived at the new-fangled 'family values' vision of
royalty there would not be the trouble we are facing today. The real English
tradition is that the monarch and his or her spouse regard each other with
indifference or loathing. Queen Victoria notoriously broke with that
tradition in her relations with Prince Albert. She was not popular until
much later, after Prince Albert had died, which left the Queen 40 clear
years to achieve a sacred reputation unencumbered by fantasies of domestic
bliss. However, that does not now seem a likely prospect for the Prince of
Wales.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Nuances of CGT on trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU recently explained the CGT treatment of unit and investment trust
savings schemes. Is not the situation even more complicated?
According to the leaflet sent with my unit trust annual report, for CGT
purposes the total amount of income reinvested, as shown on the tax credit
vouchers, should be added to the original cost. For indexation, when is the
dividend received?
Presumably it is added to the value of the units as it is received from the
constituent companies, and the voucher is only a summary of the amounts
received in the year.
Yes, the calculations for accumulation units are generally more complicated
than those for monthly savings schemes, or automatic reinvestment schemes.
For accumulation units purchased after the end of March 1985, the net
retained income shown on the first voucher ranks for indexation from the day
on which the units were purchased; subsequent net retentions rank for
indexation from either the latest date provided by the trust deed (for any
distribution in respect of the distribution period in question), or, if no
date is so provided, the last day of the distribution period. This complex
rule is derived from sections 99 and 113 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992, in conjunction with section 468 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988.
The rules are slightly different for units purchased between the end of
1981-82 and the beginning of April 1985; they are significantly different
for units purchased before April 6 1982. The position would also be slightly
different if more than one retention date fell within the first year after
the purchase, or if none did.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Losses on warrants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE held 6,000 Eurotunnel warrants since 1988. I did not exercise the
warrants because the cost of doing so was greater than the value of the
Eurotunnel shares they would have yielded. Last November the warrants
lapsed. Can I set the loss of the adjusted cost of the warrants against
investment gains for Capital Gains Tax purposes?
Yes, by virtue of section 144(4 &amp; 8) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992:
'(4) The abandonment of. . . a traded option . . . shall constitute the
disposal of an asset (namely of the option) . . .
'(8) In subsection 4 above . . . 'traded option' means an option which, at
the time of the abandonment . . is quoted on a recognised stock exchange . .
. '
If your tax inspector should try to restrict your allowable loss by invoking
the notorious wasting-asset rules (which apply to some types of option),
refer him or her to section 146 of the Act. This says the wasting-asset
rules 'shall not apply . . . to a traded option . . . ', as defined in
section 144(8).

FT  16 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tell the taxman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON September 30 last year, I retired at the age of 63 1/2 . At that time my
tax affairs were completely in accordance with the PAYE tax tables.
The trustees of my employer's pension scheme purchased an annuity for me
equal to the benefit to which I am entitled by that scheme and my P45 form
forwarded by my ex-employers to the insurance company involved.
Instead of using this information the insurance company (on the instructions
of the Inland Revenue, they claim) has been taxing me on an interim code
(OT) which apparently authorises the removal on 25 per cent of the gross
pension due, irrespective of my circumstances. This pension is my sole
source of taxed income until I reach 65. As a result, although we are only
nine months into the tax year, I have not only paid my complete tax
liability for 1992/93, I have also had Pounds 274 deducted above my
obligations (a credit towards my 1993/94 tax)
Have the Revenue the power to so over-tax me, and have I any claim for
interest on the over-paid sum and the costs of postage, telephone,
photo-copying etc that I have incurred in getting the situation corrected?
First the bad news: On the bare fact outlined, you do not appear to be
eligible for any recompense from either the Revenue or the insurance
company. Your complaint appears to lie against your employers: if they had
explained what you should tell the insurance company's tax office in order
to get the appropriate code applied to the pension, you would probably be
paying the right amount of tax. For your employers simply to send your P45
to the insurance company was not very helpful - but there is, of course, no
legal obligation upon employers to offer any guidance on tax matters to
their retiring employees (and the cost of providing any such guidance could
be taxable as a benefit). It is up to you to tell the tax office your date
of birth. The fact that you have not given us enough information for us to
calculate what your current code number should be, suggests that you may not
have given enough information to the tax office either. So, probably, the
tax office is not be blame, but neither are you, because you did not know
what you should have told them. Write to the insurance company's tax office,
giving formal notice of objection to code OT under regulation 10(1) of the
Income Tax (Employments) Regulations 1973, as amended; if possible, say what
you think the code number ought to be. Tell them your date of birth, the
total pay and tax shown on your P45 (if known), and the amount of untaxed
income which you expect to receive in 1992-93. (You told us that the pension
is your 'sole source of taxed income' at present, but you said nothing about
your untaxed income).
If you do not receive a satisfactory response within a couple of weeks,
write to the District Inspector saying that, in default of agreement to your
objection, you now give formal notice of appeal against the determination of
code OT and that you require the appeal to be heard by the General
Commissioners in February without fail, in order that the correct
(retrospective) coding be applied to the final instalment of your pension
for the current tax year. We take it that you would have no difficulty in
attending a meeting of the General Commissioners at short notice, in order
to present your argument for an appropriate code number.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: These funds have their uses but . .
. - John Authers considers the complexities of convertibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS could be the year for convertibles. Fixed interest investments are in
vogue, and offer some security, while many believe that the equity market
should have a strong year. Convertibles, securities offered by companies
which can at a later date be converted into ordinary or preference shares,
might seem to be the ideal, if rather complex, investment instrument for
today.
But no fund management houses have promoted convertibles funds, in spite of
the attention given to gilts and international bonds. Performance tables
show that the convertibles investment story is not as seductive as it seems.
Over ten years, the tables show that the average convertibles unit trust has
grown by 115.76 per cent in the 10 years to January 1, according to Micropal
(offer-to-bid, income reinvested). This is not far our of line with gilts
and fixed interest, which averaged 120.57 per cent growth over the same
period.
But over periods starting since the stock market crash of October 1987,
underperformance by convertibles has been marked. Over the last five years,
gilts and fixed interest averaged 38.76 per cent, while convertibles
registered 12.73 per cent. Over three years, the figures are 26 per cent
versus 0.52 per cent.
How can convertibles have underperformed so badly? The answer lies in the
crash of October 1987. As John Plumpton, fund manager of the Prolific
Convertible &amp; Gilt unit trust says: 'In 1988, companies wanted to issue new
equity but they couldn't because prices were so depressed and investors
wanted income. So there was a massive issuance of convertibles. They were
mainly used to finance acquisitions right at the top of the Lawson boom and
they were mostly the 1980s go-go stocks which have since gone off the
rails.'
Charles Park, fund manager with Framlington, says most of the big
convertible issues in the late 1980s involved optimistic predators
swallowing prey at the top of the market. Rather than issue conventional
debt, they paid for their purchases in convertibles. This gave the predators
immediate cost savings since yields on convertibles are lower than on normal
loans.
With hindsight, not all the acquisitions look well-founded. Park mentions
convertibles issued by British Aerospace to fund its purchase of Arlington
Securities, British &amp; Commonwealth to buy Atlantic Computers, Blue Circle in
buying Birmid Qualcast, and Ratners in buying H Samuel. Other companies
using convertibles to fund acquisitions included Evode and Amec.
The share price of many of these acquirers did not perform to expectations.
This automatically dampened convertible performance. In some cases, such as
B &amp; C, the companies crashed altogether.
By 1990, the convertibles market was afflicted by both over-supply, and a
disproportionate number of weak stocks. When the equity market recovered,
therefore, convertibles failed to follow.
The other important factor pushing the convertible market is the 'premium'
which must be paid to convert into a normal share. Convertibles yield more
than shares, so they will normally cost more. If their price rises, it is
harder to gain an easy extra income by switching from ordinary and
preference shares into convertibles.
This technical factor lies behind the other problem afflicting the market.
According to Park: 'People running high income funds found a year ago that
they were in stocks which might cut their dividends, and that they could
push up their yield by switching into convertible preference shares. In some
companies that could be done almost on a like for like basis.'
The problem is that share prices in these companies have fallen while the
convertibles have held firm. That means that fund managers now need to pay a
premium to gain the extra yield from convertibles. As Park puts it: 'To that
extent I would say convertibles are not as attractive now as they were a
year ago.'
Not all fund managers agree with this. According to Val Rodway, of Allied
Dunbar, there are several attractively priced convertibles on the market.
The supply problem is that there are often no convertibles available in
sectors which the equities research team recommends, she says. However, a
pickup in market activity this year should lead to a recovery in new issues,
she suggests.
A final argument advanced for convertibles is their yield. Half the
convertibles unit trusts are currently yielding in excess of 7.5 per cent,
which is healthy. That yield could be an adequate cushion for investors
nervous about prospects for a genuine recovery.
So is it worth investing in convertibles? The last five years show that they
are not the no-lose bets which they might appear. But the sharpest effects
of the late 1980s appear to have passed. The sector averaged an adequate
total return after charges of 11.55 per cent in 1992.
They should not be overlooked, particularly by those busy transferring money
out of uncompetitive building society accounts. Some of this money could go
into convertibles - but not all. It is hard to justify more than a small
weighting for these instruments.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The virtue of consistency -
Investment trusts, Why TR City has proved popular with private investors
Private investors are often being urged to buy shares in investment trusts.
But the names of many trusts are obscure, making it hard for the small
investor to choose the right stock / A look at TR City of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSISTENCY is a much-prized virtue in investment trusts and TR City of
London has certainly delivered it. The annual dividend has been increased in
each of the last 25 years and over ten years, its share price total return
has been the fourth best of all investment trusts, with growth of 702.6 per
cent.
This success has made the UK income trust very popular with private
investors. The number of shareholders has quadrupled from 6,000 to nearly
24,000 over the last five years, and increased by more than 50 per cent in
1991-92 alone. TR estimates that institutional investors now own less than
20 per cent of the trust.
But success can bring problems. The trust's shares are now standing at a 3
per cent premium to net assets, which means that private investors might be
attracted to other trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial, which are standing at
a discount. And the 25-year record of dividend increases may well be broken
this year; the trust is forecasting a maintained payout.
Like many trusts, the name of TR City of London dates back to the company's
19th century origins.
The City of London Brewery business was founded in 1860, and carried on
brewing until 1932. Although the company became an investment trust at that
date, City of London still owned pubs until 1970.
Then Touche Remnant took over the management and the company's name was
changed to TR City of London in 1982.
The city tag does not mean that the group's investments are concentrated on
the square mile. The investment objectives are threefold: to have a higher
yield than the FT-A All-Share Index, to get long term growth of capital and
income in excess of the All-Share, and to invest predominantly in the shares
of large companies.
A list of the 10 biggest stocks in TR City's portfolio would contain names
with which the small investor will be familiar: BT, BAT, Shell, BP, British
Gas, BTR, Smithkline Beecham, Allied-Lyons, ICI and Grand Met.
The breakdown by sectors, as of June 30, was capital goods (16.4 per cent),
consumer groups (33 per cent), oil &amp; gas (9.4 per cent), financial groups
(14.2 per cent) and others (27 per cent).
Around 75 per cent of the assets are in FT-SE 100 constituents; a further 23
per cent is in the recently-formed FT-SE Mid-Cap index; and only 2 per cent
in smaller companies.
Although the trust has a portfolio yield around 20-25 per cent above the
All-Share (which means it is currently about 5.4 per cent), it does not
concentrate exclusively on the 'high yield' area of the market. Income is
boosted by a 5.5 per cent holding in convertibles and 1.5 per cent in fixed
interest securities.
The current dividend yield of 5 per cent is one of the main reasons why many
investors pick the trust for their personal equity plans, since it offers
some real tax benefits even after allowing for the charges.
The trust's long term performance also helps, although this has been boosted
by the narrowing of the discount.
Over five years, growth has been 138.97 per cent, according to Micropal
(mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested), placing TR City top of
the UK income growth sector.
In the short term, relative performance has dropped a bit with the trust,
seventh out of ten in the sector over the year to January 1993.
Could there be any reason for this? A change of manager is always a
potential source of concern for investors and this might especially be the
case with TR City, since Michael Moule (one of the doyens of the sector)
stopped managing the trust in July 1991.
The new manager Job Curtis, aged 31, was educated at Eton and Christ Church,
Oxford (where he studied PPE) before joining the broker Grieveson Grant as a
graduate trainee in 1983. A short spell at Cornhill Insurance followed,
before he joined TR in 1987. He took over the management of the trust in
July 1991, having been deputy for the previous three years.
However, Moule is still part of the investment trust management team at TR.
And Lewis Aaron, senior investment trust analyst at S G Warburg Securities,
is not concerned at the change.
'At most of the big houses, it is not just the individual fund manager's
view, it's the house view on stocks' he says.
'Job Curtis has been involved with the trust before and I see no reason at
all for the performance to deteriorate' adds Aaron.
Curtis says the trust's investment approach has three strands. The first is
to be risk-averse and wary of companies with poor corporate governance. 'The
directors do have a small 'black list' on which companies such as Maxwell
appeared' says Curtis.
The second strand is value investing - the aim of buying shares for less
than their intrinsic worth. Curtis looks for companies with undervalued
assets such as land, mineral rights or brand names.
He also wants companies with high free cash flow, high return on assets and
high research &amp; development spending.
'Value eventually gets recognised' says Curtis 'either by investors
generally, by the management in running the company better or by a
takeover'. TR City claims a high 'strike rate' in selecting takeover targets
recently.
The third strand of the approach is income investing, given the need to
maintain the higher than average yield.
With 125 shares in the portfolio, the trust certainly has a broad spread of
investments, although its larger company emphasis means one might expect
some underperformance if the long-awaited 'smaller companies revival'
actually occurs.
But Lewis Aaron of SG Warburg says 'It's a good long term investment, not
one for short term capital gains, but a good steady core holding. If, as a
private investor, you wanted a UK trust, you would probably pick this one.'
Key facts
The trust has gross assets of Pounds 260m and a market capitalisation of
Pounds 243m, as of January 13. The dividend yield is 5 per cent. TR's annual
management charge is 0.39 per cent, based on a 3 year rolling average of
assets. There is a modest amount of gearing, with Pounds 16m of debenture
stock. Net asset value per share on January 13 was 123p, when the share
price was 127p.
Board
All board members are independent. The chairman is Jim Titcomb, a director
of English China Clays, and the other members are Sir Robin Dent, chairman
of the Public Works Loan Board, George Duncan, chairman of ASW Holdings and
David Hubbard, chairman of Powell Duffryn.
Savings scheme and PEP details
The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or
Pounds 250 for lump sums. There is a 1 per cent transaction charge.
For the personal equity plan, the minimum monthly investment is Pounds 50
and the lump sum Pounds 1,000. There is a transaction charge of 1 per cent
and an additional annual management charge of 1 per cent.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Money-back tax offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS on low incomes should pay heed to an Inland Revenue advertising
campaign launched this week: it could give them up to Pounds 860 a year in
refunds on taxes.
The Revenue is spending Pounds 2m on a campaign, aimed particularly at
pensioners and married women who do not work, who may be entitled to back
taxes.
Newspaper and television advertisements will form the backbone of efforts to
catch the eye of the two-thirds of people who are eligible to claim but have
not done so. About 8m will also receive a leaflet with their annual notice
of coding.
Those affected include 2.5m married women who can claim back the tax credit
on share dividends, and up to 15m people on low incomes who can register to
receive bank and building society interest gross.
During the 1991-92 tax year, the Revenue estimated that only Pounds 150m of
the Pounds 550m which could have been reclaimed was paid out, because only
about 5m people contacted them for refunds.
The disappointing response came in spite of intensive advertising in the
last two years. It contributed to the Revenue's decision in late 1992 to
close a number of repayment offices and to reduce staff working in these
divisions by up to 1,000.
The Revenue estimates that those who have not claimed under either scheme
include 4m pensioners, 3m married women and 3m other adults and children.
Substantial ignorance of who is eligible remains. A large number who claimed
were not on sufficiently low incomes to qualify, while many who were did not
bother.
A free telephone number (0800-660800) open from 10am-5pm on Monday to Friday
has already begun operating and will run at least until the end of March.
Independent taxation of married men and women was introduced in April 1990
and allowed women to claim back share dividend tax.
Gross payments of bank and building society interest were introduced in
April 1991.
Two leaflets are available free from the Revenue:
Leaflet IR 110. A guide for people with savings.
Leaflet IR 127. Are you paying too much tax on your savings?

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Split trust launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW split capital trust is being launched to tap the revived enthusiasm of
private investors for the investment trust sector.
Schroder Split Fund will offer a mix of zero coupon shares, income shares
and capital shares. The zeros, as their name suggests, will pay no income
but aim to give the investor steady capital growth.
The zeros' launch price is 100p and the planned repayment value will be 203p
in 2002, a gross redemption yield of 8.25 per cent a year. Profits will be
taxed as capital gains, and will be effectively tax-free, since few
investors use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance.
The zeros are 125 per cent covered at launch - in other words, the trust has
more than enough assets at launch to repay the 2002 redemption value of the
zeros in full.
The income shares will have a gross initial yield of 9 per cent, at the
issue price of 100p. There is a significant risk of loss of capital; the
trust's assets will have to grow at 4.2 per cent per annum for the shares to
be repaid in full.
However, the income shares can participate in the trust's growth. If the
assets and income of Schroder Split rise by 7.5 per cent per annum, then the
gross redemption yield will be 13 per cent.
Schroder is also offering a new High Income personal equity plan, based on
the income shares. There will be no initial charge on the Pep between
February 10 and March 4; the annual charge will be 1 per cent plus VAT.
Income will be paid quarterly.
The capital shares will be entitled to the remaining assets after the income
and zero shareholders have been repaid. Shareholders will only be repaid
their original investment of 25p if the assets grow by 4.7 per cent per
annum between launch and 2002.
The 'gearing' effect means capital shareholders will do well out of a bull
market. If the trust's assets and income grow at 7.5 per cent per annum, the
capital shareholders will receive a gross redemption yield of 21.5 per cent
pa.
One problem with some split capital trusts is that, to meet the income
requirements, the manager has to invest in high-yielding stocks or
convertibles, at the expense of capital growth. The portfolio yield on
Schroder Split will be 5.5 per cent which the manager argues is lower than
on many other split trusts.
The launch expenses of the trust will be capped at 4 per cent and total
annual expenses will be 0.7 per cent.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: 'Guaranteed' products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARANTEED products offer investors variations on the slogan 'stock market
growth or your money back'. A new round has been launched this month.
National &amp; Provincial Building Society is offering a Guaranteed Equity
Reserve account, which promises the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index in the form
of 'interest' which can be received at the end of a five year period.
There is a slight twist on the normal formula, in that the final Footsie
figure will be based on the average level of the index over the final six
months of the product's life (September 1, 1997 to February 28, 1998). As a
minimum, investors will receive their money back on maturity in March 1998.
Like most other products in this area, this account does not pay any income,
nor does it reflect the income on the Footsie (which at 4-5 per cent a year
is a significant component of equity returns).
Basic rate tax is deducted at source and the result is that such taxpayers
will receive 100 per cent of the rise in the Footsie over the period
(starting March 1).
However, a bonus for those who invest before January 20, pushes the rate up
to 103.7 per cent; those who invest between January 21 and February 15 will
get 101.5 per cent.
Higher rate taxpayers would face a further bill, bringing the return down to
around 80 per cent of the Footsie's rise (or 83 per cent with the full
bonus).
Unless they use up their Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance, higher rate payers
would almost certainly do better to invest in a indexed fund, where the
return would mostly come in the form of capital gain.
However, unlike some insurance-based guaranteed products, N &amp; P says that
non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax on this account.
This would convert the return into 133.33 per cent of the Footsie's rise (or
138.33 per cent with the full bonus).
If you want to withdraw your money, you cannot do so during the first year.
After that, there is a 'penalty' of 5 per cent and no interest will be
credited. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and the maximum Pounds
250,000.
Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial adviser group, is offering a product
which combines a fixed interest bond with the capital shares of split
capital investment trusts. The fixed interest portion (in a guaranteed
growth bond from Consolidated Life) will grow so that the total capital will
rise by at least 20 per cent over five years (net of basic rate tax).
The capital shares then give the investor a 'geared' interest in the stock
market. If the trust's assets rise by 7 per cent per annum, then the total
return would rise to 40 per cent. Returns rise substantially as the
investment assumptions get more optimistic.
There is an element of flexibility in the product since the investors can
take profits on the capital shares if they rise substantially over the five
year period. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000.
Meanwhile, Sun Alliance is launching a third issue of its Capital Protector
Bond. This offers a four year guarantee, but only 90 per cent of the fund is
linked to stock market growth.
Charges are 4.5 per cent initial and 1.25 per cent annual; there are
surrender penalties during the first four years. The minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: When to say 'yes' to BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN THOUGH the Goat Advisory Bureau wished the venture 'every success',
Angora International - a Business Expansion Scheme - became a butt for jokes
as it was not a success. Fortunately, I did not have an investment in it.
Over the years I have resisted the tax temptations of a wide variety of
business expansion schemes, including one, Unicorn Heritage, which offered
the opportunity of 'the chilling sensation of walking down the corridor with
Mary Queen of Scots on the way to her execution.' Instead, Unicorn got the
chop as its business failed.
I did, however, invest in a small number of BES companies and although,
taking tax considerations into account, I have made a profit, I will not be
mourning the ending of such schemes.
In his budget last year, the Chancellor, Norman Lamont, announced that BES
will 'come to an end' on December 31, 1993. According to the chancellor's
statement, when BES was first introduced 'the venture capital industry was
in its infancy and there was concern that the investment needs of small
firms were not well understood and provided for.'
However, he said Britain 'now has a venture capital industry the equal of
that anywhere in the world outside the US. But the provisions of the
Business Expansion Scheme have become ever-more complex. And nowadays only a
small part of the total invested goes to small businesses.'
This latter comment has, to me, been the saddest feature of the schemes.
Vast sums were poured into property-backed ventures rather than into new and
innovative small companies involved in manufacturing. Even with tax relief
of 75 per cent (when high-rate taxpayers like me started investing in such
schemes in 1983/84) there seemed to be too few attractive manufacturing
companies available in which to invest.
Nearly all of my BES investments have reached the end of the qualifying
period for tax-free capital gains and their sponsors have provided various
'exit routes' for investors.
For example, I invested in the 1983/84 Britannia BES Fund which backed a
range of companies, including three which went into receivership. But some
of its investments performed much better, especially the fund's Pounds
61,270 investment in Graham Wood, a structural steel fabricator, which
produced a return of Pounds 602,900.
By the time the Britannia scheme had disposed of all of its investments and
wound-up the fund (in 1991) investors who had been in the highest rate tax
bracket had received a return of more than 290 per cent.
In 1985, I invested in Hotel Apartments, a BES company sponsored by Johnson
Fry. The shares, before tax relief, cost me Pounds 1 each. The company sold
its hotels and I received a payment of Pounds 1.06p a share in September
1991 and a further 2p per share in December last year.
While I am quite pleased to see the end of this investment, I am sorry that
my involvement with another BES company, Perry Publications (Holdings) has
ended. I invested in Perry in 1987 because I very much enjoyed reading the
monthly magazine which it produced: Business Traveller. I thought it was the
best magazine of its type on the market.
Unfortunately, the world of publishing is tough and so the company felt in
need of a partner which could strengthen its financial resources and enable
it to expand. Thus, Motor-Press International Verlagsgesellschaft Holding,
part of a German publishing group, made an offer to acquire investors'
interests in the company. I accepted their offer. For each share in Perry
Publications which cost me Pounds 1, ignoring tax relief, I received 43p in
November last year and will receive a further 42p per share in March this
year.
I wish there had been some other way in which Perry Publications (Holdings)
could have raised additional funds in order to develop Business Traveller so
that I could have retained a small financial interest, as I remain convinced
of the publication's potential in the UK and US and would have liked to have
shared in the future profits - but without being locked in.
But, then, that has always been one of the problems with BES companies:
those you wish to escape from you find yourself locked in for longer than
anticipated whereas it is impossible to have a long-term relationship with
companies where it is desirable.
I hope that, in spite of the demise of the BES, small companies will still
seek funds for expansion from private investors and will not rely on
institutional investment. Perhaps, in his next budget, the Chancellor could
announce the DTI sponsorship of a 'sorting house' which would match private
investors with small companies seeking to raise funds for expansion - and
provide this service at no cost to the companies and investors concerned.

THE Business Expansion Scheme could be about to expand, even though few
schemes are on the market.
Investors should be pleased with this because the delay has been caused by
stiff competition between sponsors trying to tie up deals with universities
and housing associations. They are now being forced to go through 'beauty
parades', and as a result sponsors' fees are coming down.
Speculation over another fall in base rates has also held up plans. If rates
do fall from seven per cent, many of the institutions underwriting the
schemes will want to cut the returns on offer to investors after the
five-year tax exemption period for BES investments has closed.
It is not clear how many institutions are going to use the BES to convert
housing which they have repossessed into assured tenancies. BES makes it
easy for banks to lessen the damage of bad loans on their balance sheets,
but as yet no building societies have converted repossessions using the BES.
Several are discussing this, and if they do so then the supply of products
should be substantially increased.
Non-recourse loans, which allow investors to exit from the investments after
six months, have made it much easier to sell the scheme to customers, and so
many companies with reputations in other investment markets may now launch
into the BES.
The bottom line for investors is that there should be enough money to go
around, and it would be unwise to rush for the first scheme which appears,
or to be disheartened if attempts to buy into a BES so far this tax year
have been unsuccessful.
The one new BES scheme this week is City North 3. It has no 'guarantee', but
will aim to make as high a return as possible, with no upper limit. The
company will invest in rental accommodation.

BRITISH Bio-Technology came to the market in June last year as a
highly-rated pharmaceutical research and development company. The company is
making losses and those are forecast to rise during this year and next as
research costs increase. Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, sold 100,000
at 435p leaving himself with 800,000 shares. At the same time Dr John Gordon
exercised an option over 100,000 shares and sold 50,000 of them at 435p.
That takes his holding to 51,000.
Reports of strong trading in December boosted shares in the motor sectors
and Pendragon, the up-market car dealer, is no exception - the shares have
outperformed by over 30 per cent during the last month. The four key
executives, including the chairman and chief executive, have sold a total of
370,000 shares at 242p. Nigel Rudd, the chairman, sold 25,000 shares at 222p
towards the end of December.
George Robb's purchases of shares at Aberdeen Petroleum are worthy of note.
He purchased 500,000 shares at prices between 6p and 7p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Another side of life / A look at the
latest with-profits bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MORE LIFE offices announced their with-profit bonuses this week. The most
interesting figures come from two companies which do not do much business
through brokers. Their results seem to strengthen claims that earlier
pay-outs from other offices have not been supported by investment results,
but were aimed at drumming up new business.
Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses, which specialises in products for
the health care professions, saw ten-year pay-outs decline by 3.0 per cent
from Pounds 7,943 to Pounds 7,705 (assuming Pounds 30 premiums per month
were paid by a policyholder aged 29 at the outset). This is the highest
ten-year figure yet announced, overtaking Pounds 7291 from Tunbridge Wells
Equitable. The lowest pay-out, from Guardian Royal Exchange, is Pounds
5,022.
For 25-year policies, pay-outs have increased by 4.7 per cent to Pounds
63,680, the second highest pay-out yet announced. RNPFN expects to pay
Pounds 28m in maturities this year, of which more than 90 per cent are for
ten-year policies.
Royal London, a 'home service' company which does not deal through brokers,
also announced a high ten-year pay-out, which fell from Pounds 7,628 to
Pounds 7,323 using the same assumptions. Its 25-year pay-out remains
unchanged at Pounds 63,797. This will drop to Pounds 62,014 on February 1.
Royal London uses a slightly different bonus system from most of the
industry, and these figures are an interim position. A further valuation
will be made at the end of March, and new maturities will apply from the
beginning of May. Unlike offices such as Norwich Union and Sun Alliance,
Royal London does not have to cope with a big bulge of ten-year maturities
this year - ten-year pay-outs account for 23 per cent of ordinary branch
business up from 21.5 per cent. For the industrial branch, the figures are
20 per cent, following 15 per cent.
Scottish Mutual, which is owned by Abbey National, kept reversionary bonuses
unchanged, but cut interim bonuses which will apply during the next year.
This led to a 4.7 per cent cut in ten-year pay-outs, down to Pounds 6,613,
but a slight increase in 25-year maturity values from Pounds 54,787 on the
last relevant date to Pounds 55,107.
NPI, a pensions specialist office, announced substantially reduced bonuses.
On pensions policies, the cuts concentrated on reversionary or annual
bonuses, to reflect its reduced expectations for investment returns. The
effect is cuts of around 6 per cent in pay-outs for regular premium pension
plans, but this varies according to the term of the policy.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Demand continues for fixed-rate
mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIXED-RATE mortgage offers continued to be issued this week to satisfy
increased demand while interest rates remain low.
Anne Gunter, of National Westminster bank's mortgage services, says nearly
half the bank's customers chose a fixed-rate mortgage last year. The bank
has launched three more fixed rate offers, which apply to endowment and
pension mortgages only.
The choice is between a fix of 7.99 per cent until February 28 1995, one at
8.69 per cent until the end of February 1997 or 9.29 per cent until February
29 2000. All carry a fee of Pounds 250. The redemption penalties are two
months, three months and six months respectively.
Halifax has issued three new short-term fixed rates, two of which are aimed
at first-time buyers. They can choose to pay 6.5 per cent fixed until
October 31 1994 if they borrow up to 90 per cent of the value of the home,
or 6.7 per cent for the same period on a maximum loan of 95 per cent. Fixed
rates are available on all types of mortgage and an insurance-related
product has to be taken out. The fee is Pounds 200 and the early redemption
penalty is two months' interest. A fixed rate of 7.5 per cent is available
until April 30 1995 on all mortgage types.
Leeds Permanent has issued a three-year mortgage fixed at 7.45 per cent, but
it is restricted to loans on not more than 70 per cent of the value of the
home. Those wanting an 80 per cent loan can fix at 7.75 per cent. The fee
for either mortgage is Pounds 195 and they are available on all types of
loan. The borrower has to buy two insurance-related products. Early
redemption charges are staggered annually.
Portman building society is launching a first-time buyer's mortgage from
Monday, available on repayment mortgages as well as others. Buyers can
choose between two types of offer. They can either accept a discount of two
percentage points below the society's variable base rate, currently 8.7 per
cent, for 12 months - the rate is therefore 6.7 per cent - or they can fix
at 6.7 per cent until March 31 1994. The mortgages come with two years
redundancy cover but building and contents insurance has to be taken out.
There is no application fee.
Portman is offering a 7.5 per cent two-year fix, distinguished by requiring
no application fee. It is available on all types of mortgage, and is not
dependent on the borrower taking out insurance-related products. There is a
three months' redemption penalty on these mortgages.
Nationwide is also offering a two-year fix at 7.25 per cent, available on
repayment and endowment mortgages. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195 and
Nationwide's mortgage payment cover policy has to be taken out. Early
redemption penalties are six months in the first year, four in the second.
Two fixed rate deals became available from Birmingham Midshires this week.
The first is 7.35 per cent fixed for two years for an arrangement fee of
Pounds 195. The early redemption penalty is three months interest. Those
wanting to fix for a longer period may prefer to pay 8.49 per cent fixed
until the end of January 1998. The fee is Pounds 245 with a penalty of six
months' interest payable on early redemption.

CONFEDERATION PEP Managers is launching an income Pep, which gives investors
the choice of three unit trusts: high income, growth and smaller companies.
The high income trust is eighth out of 30 in the UK balanced sector over
three years to January 1, with growth of 16.1 per cent (offer-to-bid with
income reinvested). The yield is 5.9 per cent.
The growth trust is 38th out of 93 in the UK general sector over three
years, with a rise of 15.6 per cent. The yield is 3.9 per cent. In a poor
period for smaller companies, Confederation's fund is 26th out of 56 in its
sector over three years.
All three trusts have initial charges of 5.7 per cent and annual charges of
1.25 per cent. The only further charges for PEP investors are Pounds 25 plus
VAT for second (and subsequent) withdrawals within a year, or for those who
want annual reports. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
                            *      *      *
Scottish Life is offering a product to help the calculations of those who
are not in a final salary pension scheme. Talisman Retirement Targeting will
work out what level of contributions into a personal pension are needed to
get a given percentage of salary at retirement. The system will allow for
factors such as the need for a spouse's pension.
                            *      *      *
Northern Rock Building Society has relaunched Go Direct, its instant access
postal account. It is paying 8.55 per cent gross on Pounds 20,000 and above,
8.3 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000 to just under Pounds 20,000 and 8.05 per
cent gross on a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000.
Coventry Building Society is offering a limited issue two year fixed rate
account which pays 8.7 per cent gross on Pounds 40,000 and above. The rate
on Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 40,000 is 8.5 per cent gross and on a minimum
balance of Pounds 1,000, it is 8 per cent gross. Withdrawals during the
fixed rate period will be subject to 90 days' loss of interest.
                            *      *      *
Family Assurance has launched an ingenious new pension fund, aimed at people
in the last decade before retirement. It will use both cash funds and
index-tracking equity funds to offer an alternative to more traditional
'with-profits' contracts.
The Retirement Countdown Bond can be used either as a personal pension or as
a free standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC).
A proportion of money invested will be placed in a fixed interest and cash
fund managed by Family, while the remainder is invested in the Morgan
Grenfell FT-All Share index tracker fund. For those within two years of
retirement the fund is entirely invested in cash.
Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Charges include a Pounds 60 start-up fee
5 per cent bid-offer spread, a 1 per cent fund management charge and monthly
administration charge of Pounds 1.50.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Building a retirement nest egg -
Single premium pensions for the self-employed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETIREMENT saving for the self-employed takes discipline. But it can be done
much more effectively, and more cheaply, if the discipline comes from the
saver and not the insurance company. That means using single premium
pensions, rather than the more heavily sold and arguably more convenient
regular premium contracts.
At this time of year, people with an irregular income will normally start to
put some of it into a personal pension. This is most administratively simple
if the pension is a regular premium arrangement, where you have contracted
in advance to make fixed payments at fixed intervals. The other big
advantage of this method is 'pound-cost averaging'. By saving regularly in
small amounts, the problem of timing is avoided, and, if the market is
turbulent, then at least some of the premiums will be paid when values are
at their cheapest.
If you opt to buy a single premium pension each year, you will need to do so
between January and March. But James Higgins of Chamberlain De Broe points
out that the first few months of the year are not traditionally the best
time to invest in equities. The standard stock market saw is to 'sell in May
and go away'.
So regular premiums might be better for the totally unsophisticated.
However, there are limits to this investment argument. Firstly, single
premiums allow the investor to choose a different manager each year,
diversifying risk, and spreading expertise. Diversification is, if anything,
even more desirable than pound-cost averaging.
Taking the pension on retirement could get very difficult if too many
companies are used. But using five or six fund managers, rather than one,
for managing pension funds, can only increase the security of the final
retirement income.
Then there is the fact that, in the words of John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp;
Noble, 'a pension is no more than an investment which has tax advantages and
also tax restrictions'. It should be treated, he says, as a part of a wide
portfolio of investments.
As pensions justifiably cost more to administer than other forms of saving,
that would point to making regular savings through another vehicle, and
topping up annually with single premium pensions where necessary. For
example, regular savings into a unit or investment trust Pep provide much
the same investments as a personal pension. Contributions are not 'grossed
up' when they are paid in, but the final payout can be taken at any time and
is more tax-efficient than a pension payout.
Those who do not opt for a Pep saving scheme might still take out a regular
premium pension plan for a relatively small amount. This limits the danger
that you will be unable to keep up with a high regular premium, and then
face stiff penalties.
This is the approach recommended by David Harris of Chantrey Vellacott. He
says: 'In general, I would attempt to encourage individuals to pay around 25
per cent of their total annual contributions by regular premiums and then
undertake a fuller, additional, planning exercise to use up as much of their
total retirement reliefs as possible each year.'
Personal pensions come in almost as broad a range of sectors and investments
as unit trusts, so this allows enthusiastic investors the chance to make
some imaginative choices.
It is the expense which makes single premiums better for most people.
Typically, the commission on a Pounds 100 per month regular contract works
out at Pounds 540, while for a Pounds 5,000 single premium it would be
Pounds 260 - you would need to pay regular premiums a long time to
counterbalance this.
The 'allocation rate' plays an important part of this - this refers to the
proportion of premiums paid which are actually put towards providing
retirement benefits. According to Harris, with regular contributions,
allocation rates for an initial period (usually one or two years) are
between 50 and 70 per cent. After that, around 95 per cent will go towards
benefits. This can increase to more than 100 per cent for young lives, or
for large contributions (Harris suggests Pounds 500 per month or more).
By contrast, single premium contributions under Pounds 5,000 usually have
between 95 and 97 per cent allocation rates, according to Harris, and this
can rise to 105 per cent for contributions of Pounds 15,000 or more.
Other charges to watch out for on regular premium contracts are the standard
bid-offer spread - almost always five per cent - plus annual management
charges and flat plan charges.
Cole identifies one typical client for whom single premiums are always
preferable - the person who takes early retirement and then continues to
work on a freelance or consultancy basis. Both the level of income each year
from such an arrangement, and the timespan before the client wants to start
drawing the pension are unknown, so a regular premium policy cannot be
justified.

<TEXT>
Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator, is expected on Monday to report a marginal increase in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.7m to about Pounds 8.9m.
Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK
from overseas companies, and the performance of new products.
On Tuesday, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is
forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds
9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m. Lower interest payments, increased demand and
broader markets - especially Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind
the rise.
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included
from Tyne Tees. This would be a little below original estimates of about
Pounds 19m, but still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise.
Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to
nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the
annual results on Wednesday. Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about
Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m of exceptionals, against a profit of
Pounds 12.4m.
The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas
hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A
smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from
Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: How does Miras work?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRAS IS effectively a subsidy to those who take out a mortgage to buy a
home. The mortgage holder gets tax relief on the interest he pays for the
loan, but there is a ceiling on the size of the loan eligible for tax relief
 -currently Pounds 30,000. The amount of relief is also limited to 25 per
cent even for top-rate taxpayers.
If you were to take out a mortgage for Pounds 30,000 at an interest rate of
8.50 per cent the amount of interest you would have to pay for a year would
be Pounds 2,550. Tax relief at 25 per cent on this amount would be Pounds
637.50. So the total interest you would pay would be Pounds 1,912.50.
The tax relief for someone taking out a Pounds 100,000 mortgage would still
be Pounds 637.50 because of the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on the size of the
loan. Higher rate taxpayers cannot claim any extra relief.
In 1983, the way in which the tax relief was applied changed to become
mortgage interest relief at source (Miras). The borrower pays interest net
of the basic rate relief and the lender reclaims the tax relief from the
Inland Revenue. Before the change, relief was given by tax offices through
tax assessments.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The threat to interest relief on
mortgages / A look at the cost of Miras, increasingly seen as a burden by
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST two years after Norman Lamont, the chancellor, abolished higher rate
tax relief on mortgage interest, speculation is mounting that the sacred cow
of Miras, mortgage interest relief at source, might again be under threat.
With a public sector borrowing requirement approaching Pounds 37bn this
financial year, and expectations that it might top Pounds 50bn in 1993-94,
there is no shortage of guesses about the measures the government might take
to reduce it.
The cost of Miras to the government has been falling but it is still
expensive. It is expected to cost the Treasury Pounds 5.2bn this year, down
from Pounds 6.1bn in 1991-92. The fall is a reflection of the sluggish
housing market and the lowering of interest rates last year. In 1990-91, the
last year of marginal rate tax relief, the cost of Miras peaked at Pounds
7.7bn.
Miras has been criticised for being an inefficient subsidy since it is
applied at a flat rate to all borrowers, regardless of financial position.
It has also been blamed for helping to keep house prices high. But two
measures have watered down the distortionary effects on the housing market.
The first was the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on loans, increased from Pounds
25,000 in 1983 but not raised since. This was followed in 1991 by the
abolition of higher rate tax relief. The announcement that dual mortgage tax
relief would be abolished in 1988 was highly inflationary but its
disappearance has now helped to reduce the importance of Miras to home
buyers.
Nevertheless, experts believe that abolishing Miras might have a disastrous
effect on confidence in the housing market, unless it were accompanied by
other measures, for example encouraging first-time buyers.
There are 9.7m people who benefit from Miras. The greatest number - 5.8m -
earn between Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000. None would welcome, but many
could afford, to lose the existing relief - Pounds 637 a year on a Pounds
30,000 mortgage - particularly if it were phased out rather than removed in
one go.
Those who would be most affected by abolition are at the bottom end of the
market. The interest at 8.5 per cent on a Pounds 50,000 mortgage is Pounds
354 a month and Miras brings this figure down to Pounds 301 a month - a 17
per cent difference.
Ian Darby, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, says that this could make the
difference between buying or renting for prospective first-time buyers. At
current rates of interest, there is little difference between the cost of
buying or renting and most people would therefore prefer to buy.
He says: 'Removing Miras might tilt the balance again against buying. Those
at the middle and top end of the market are reliant on the bottom end to get
the chain moving.'
Estate agents have been reporting increased activity in December and
January. David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate
Agents, says that it would not be helpful of the government to abolish Miras
when such interest has just started to pick up.
'House prices would fall and it could make the negative equity situation
worse,' he says.
Mindful of the possibility of such an effect, there have been a number of
suggestions to change Miras but to use the the savings to galvanise the
bottom end of the market.
Halifax, the UK's largest lender, has suggested raising the ceiling for
first-time buyers only. The extra relief could then be phased out over a
number of years. But this measure might still prove more costly than the
existing system unless mortgage relief was withdrawn from other borrowers:
Halifax suggests phasing out tax relief for existing owner-occupiers.
However, there is concern about penalising those who already have mortgages.
'We would want existing borrowers to be protected,' said Adrian Coles, of
the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
'We are in deep recession with high arrears and repossessions. It would not
be sensible to make existing mortgages more expensive.'
Michael Shaw, chief executive of Britannia building society and chairman of
the Building Societies Association, agrees. 'I would rather the government
left Miras untouched because in the present state of the market, any changes
could be disruptive,' he said.
However, Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, supports the
gradual phasing out of Miras but, in the current state of the property
market, believes it could be combined with incentives for first time buyers.
He would also like the government to use the money saved by providing low
income mortgage owners with a subsidy similar to the housing subsidy to
which those in the rental sector are entitled.
Short-term incentives, however, carry their own danger. The temporary
abolition of stamp duty on properties worth up to Pounds 250,000 at the end
of 1991, is now agreed to have been little short of a disaster. 'It didn't
create more sales - it just bunched them up. There was a rush of activity
and then the market went dead,' said Paul Burgin, of Abbey National, the
second largest lender. 'We welcome moves to help the housing market but not
short-term measures that distort it.'
John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, is
another critic of Miras but thinks that withdrawing it without a substitute
would cause psychological damage to a stagnant market. His idea is to
withdraw Miras but give instead a lump sum grant of Pounds 3,000-Pounds
4,000 to all house buyers to encourage movement in the market.
In order to avoid the stamp duty syndrome, when buyers rushed to complete
before the tax was reimposed last August, he says the government should not
announce the suspension of the lump sum payment long in advance. But it
could be removed once the housing market started to pick up.
Daniel Dorling, housing research fellow at the University of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, regards Miras as a waste of money. 'The problem with
Miras is that only a small proportion of it goes to the people who need the
relief. It doesn't help young buyers. It is a badly-targetted, inefficient
subsidy. '
He suggests phasing Miras out by reducing the Pounds 30,000 ceiling by
Pounds 1,000 each quarter on mortgages. The money saved could be used to
support the bottom end of the market by buying up properties for social
housing.
Dorling does not believe the effect on the property market would be negative
but prospective housebuyers could be given an incentive in the form of the
removal of stamp duty.
It is clear that the government would have to apply any changes to Miras
carefully so that confidence in an already fragile housing market is not
further undermined. It may begin with gentle tinkering of the subsidy but it
seems increasingly certain that Miras's days are numbered.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Facts are not necessarily better than rumours -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE affairs of the royal family drift out of the realm of rumour into
that of fact, the financial markets seem to be heading in the opposite
direction.
Any stock market trader worth his red braces had got hold of a faxed
transcript of the purported royal telephone conversation this week. All were
instant experts on who said what to whom. Yet no one seemed to know what was
really happening to interest rates, to corporate rights issues, or to fiscal
policy.
Throughout the week all three were the subject of persistent rumours. Base
rates were set to fall on Friday, so the gossip went; a large rights issue
was due at any moment; the government might - or might not - raise value
added tax in the budget, widen the VAT base, cut back on income tax relief.
By the end of the week there had been no cut in interest rates, and only one
new rights issue, raising Pounds 46m for First National Finance. The outlook
for taxes remained shrouded in mystery. The only new fact available was the
date of the Budget, March 16.
The outlook for interest rates seemed particularly unclear. Although the
government had been signalling for some time that an immediate cut in rates
was unlikely, traders convinced themselves that one was possible on Friday.
They were reinforced in this view by the recent strength of sterling - in
the early part of the week it was still healthily above DM 2.50, well above
its post-Black Wednesday lows - and by short-term movements in the money
markets, where the overnight rate fell to as low as 3 per cent at one point.
Friday came and went, however, with base-rates firmly stuck at 7 per cent.
That was not the only bad news. Sterling had weakened to below DM 2.50 for
the first time since the very first days of the year. Worse, new inflation
statistics appeared to limit the government's freedom to make such a cut any
time soon.
The figures for the retail price index in December, published at Friday
lunchtime, contained the expected healthy performance on the headline
inflation rate, which fell to 2.6 per cent, the lowest rate since the summer
of 1986.
The rate the government is watching, however, is the underlying one,
calculated by leaving out the drop in mortgage interest payments. This was
much less encouraging. It rose 0.1 per cent in December to 3.7 per cent,
ominously near the the government's target ceiling of 4 per cent.
Not only does this make an immediate cut in short-term interest rates less
likely, it also has worrying implications for long-term rates.
Investors alarmed at the size of likely public-sector borrowing this year
have been pinning their hopes to a Budget which does something to close the
gap between what the government takes in and what it spends. One
talked-about measure is a higher rate of VAT - or the extension of this tax
to more items.
A move of either sort, on a scale large enough to be much help to government
finances, would be likely to push inflation over its target ceiling in the
second half of 1993. Friday's inflation figures help close off this
revenue-raising option, making the threat of a steady rise in public debt
more real.
The gilt market had had an unpleasant reminder of that fact earlier in the
week, thanks to Tuesday's announcement of a gilt auction. This long-expected
news served to concentrate the worriers' minds, and the yield on the
long-term gilt rose to 8.83 per cent, a rise of a quarter of a percentage
point in six trading days.
By Friday, despite the poor inflation news, gilts had recovered slightly,
with the yield on the long gilt finishing the week at 8.77 per cent. Next
week's performance will turn on the December public sector borrowing
figures, due on Tuesday.
Fixed-interest investors will not be the only people watching that number
closely. Finance Directors eager to raise cash will be keen to get their
rights issues away before the flood of government paper hits the market.
Though there have as yet been no unexpected large issues, the market is
apprehensive that they are on the way. Two making headlines this week - the
Lonrho issue, which closed on Friday, and the FNFC issue announced the same
day - were scarcely favourable auguries.
As intended, large investors stayed away from the Lonrho issue in droves,
leaving the way clear for Dieter Bock, the German property entrepreneur, to
become the group's largest shareholder. The FNFC issue of convertible
preference shares, a rescue operation, came as the consumer credit company
announced a Pounds 32m pre-tax loss for the year.
This, at least, was fact rather than rumour. So were some intriguing figures
calculated by the London Stock Exchange, and summarised in the chart. They
show that a handful of big companies are an important cause of the slide in
the FT-SE 100 index from its high of 2861.5 on January 4, 1993 to the
2,765.1 recorded at Friday's close.
Nearly half the index's fall is accounted for by the performance of ten big
shares. The drop in Glaxo alone accounts for 13 per cent of the index's
slide. It has not been a good week for the mighty, all round.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Operation Technology overshadows Iraq - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE was a reason why the US stock markets reacted so indifferently this
week to the news that Allied warplanes had bombed Iraq, it was that
investors were too busy kicking up a storm in the technology sector to
notice.
The huge gains earned by computer and related technology stocks this week
have energised Wall Street, fuelling talk that semiconductor and software
companies are rapidly becoming the new bellwethers of the market. A futures
trader in Chicago said on Thursday that Intel and Microsoft had replaced
General Motors and IBM as the best indicators of market performance.
Given that Intel and Microsoft have come from nowhere in the last decade to
challenge IBM's position as the company with the largest market
capitalisation in the US, and that both stocks are traded on Nasdaq's
electronic dealer-driven market and not on the New York Stock Exchange,
traditional home to the nation's blue-chips, the US equity markets appear to
be undergoing a quiet revolution.
The evidence is certainly there. The Nasdaq is now the world's second
largest stock market when measured in terms of the dollar value of trading.
Last year, Dollars 890.8bn of shares were traded on the market, almost
double Tokyo's total.
Although this was still some way short of the NYSE's Dollars 1,700bn, the
Nasdaq is catching up fast. Dollar volume grew by 28.4 per cent last year,
more than double the NYSE's growth rate.
In terms of the number of shares traded, Nasdaq is also coming up on the Big
Board's rails. More than 48bn shares were traded on Nasdaq last year,
compared with 51bn shares on the NYSE. It is even closer in terms of average
daily volume, which stands at 202m shares to 191m shares in the NYSE's
favour.
The story behind the figures is that more US investors are trading the stock
of smaller, fast-expanding companies which derive much of their growth from
technological innovation, and less are trading the big, established
industrial giants of the post-war era whose growth move ponderously in
synchronisation with the economic cycle.
Also, more investors are trading the new stocks via dealers who quote prices
on computer screens and trade over the telephone, as opposed to trading
through brokers who complete orders on pieces of paper with specialist
market-makers on the floor of the NYSE.
The shifting nature of equities trading can also be seen in the performance
of the various indices. Anyone glancing at the financial page this week
would have judged that the US markets were going nowhere in a hurry - the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 16 points in the first four days of
trading and, at 3,267, is still 150 points below 1992's high. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 has fared only slightly better, and remains down on the year so
far.
Yet if someone was told that the Nasdaq's main index was as good a
representation of market performance as the Dow or the S&amp;P's 500, the
picture changes. The Nasdaq composite index has already risen three per cent
this year, to a new all-time high of 695.70 (Thursday's close). Daily volume
on Nasdaq so far this year has also been extremely high at 242m shares,
almost as much as the 249m shares recorded on the NYSE.
The message in all this seems to be that if you want to find out how
investors rate the performance of US companies, it is worth checking to see
how the Nasdaq composite is doing, as well as the Dow or S&amp;P's.
Yet this message should carry a warning. Many of the stocks that have lifted
the Nasdaq market to new highs are small, growth-oriented, technology-based
companies that are viewed by investors as excellent vehicles for
speculation. They like to buy them when the Nasdaq market booms, but they
are just as quick to get out at the first hint of a setback. As
beneficiaries of the market's 'hot money', Nasdaq prices are much more
volatile than their counterparts on the NYSE.
The recent rise in Nasdaq stocks already has the look of a speculative
rally, and a pattern is developing similar to last year. In the first
quarter of 1992, investors could not get enough of Nasdaq stocks, and the
composite index rose 6.3 per cent. The same stocks, however, suddenly fell
out of favour when the rally slowed and, in the second quarter, the
composite index dropped 7.5 per cent.
Do not be surprised if something similar happens this year. Analysts this
week were already warning that the Nasdaq market was looking a bit 'frothy'.
As one analyst put it: 'All of these stocks have come too far, too fast, and
will have a come-uppance at some point.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Index linking adds shine to gilts - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION has fallen to 2.6 per cent, so it may seem an odd time to be
extolling the virtues of index-linked gilts. But their appeal to the private
investor is three-fold. The first attraction is that inflation might rise,
whatever the views of the pundits. Traditionally, devaluations of the pound
and high budget deficits have led to higher prices eventually.
The second is that, even if inflation does stay low, the 'real' returns (the
nominal returns minus inflation) offered by index-linked gilts may look
attractive. Currently long-dated indexed issues offer real returns of
between 3.5 and four per cent.
The attractions are increased by their tax efficiency. Much of the return
from an index-linked gilt comes in the form of tax-free capital gain. There
is a small income - two or 2.5 per cent - on most issues. But this means
that even top-rate taxpayers will pay a maximum of one per cent in tax per
annum.
So, assuming inflation averages four per cent, an index-linked issue with a
real yield of 3.7 per cent offers the prospect of a net return of 6.7 per
cent a year to the top-rate taxpayer. A building society would have to pay
11.2 per cent gross to offer an equivalent return.
What about conventional gilts as an alternative? It is possible to work out
a break-even level inflation rate, above which index-linked issues will be
more attractive than conventional gilts.
Graham Cox, economist at Sun Life, says these calculations make index-linked
issues look very attractive. For top-rate taxpayers, Greenwell Montagu shows
the break-even inflation rates as 1.62 per cent for the 2001 issue; 1.6 per
cent for 1998; 1.24 per cent for 1996; and minus 0.4 per cent for the 1994
issue. Most economists would expect inflation to be higher than those rates.
So why are these highly attractive investments not a more common part of
investors' portfolios? One problem is that, though simple in concept,
index-linked gilts are fiendishly complicated in practice. The value of your
investment does not go up in line with inflation every year.
All that is certain for the investor is that the repayment value of the gilt
on maturity will reflect the increase in the retail prices index since
issue. Similarly, the dividend will go up in line with the RPI each
half-year.
But the price of the gilt is set by supply and demand; so if investors think
that inflation is going to be low, and sell index-linked gilts, the price
will fall. Index-linked issues will then trade, as they do now, below their
theoretical value.
This makes them more attractive to new investors buying at current prices.
Instead of the two per cent or 2.5 per cent above inflation that such gilts
offered on issue, they now offer real returns of 3.5 per cent plus.
What makes pricing specially difficult is the eight month 'gap' in
indexation. Rather than use the RPI figures for the month of issue and
maturity, the Bank of England calculates indexation on the basis of the RPI
eight months before issue and maturity. This is administratively easier for
the Bank but is a lot more difficult for everyone else.
The consequence of the gap is that investors are left without inflation
protection for the last eight months of the issue. So the higher the
expected inflation rate, the lower the real return on index-linked.
This has a particular effect on short-dated issues since the eight-month gap
is a large proportion of the time till maturity. The FT, for example, shows
real yields on the basis of five per cent, and 10 per cent, expected
inflation. On Friday morning, the 1996 issue had a real yield of 2.85 per
cent on the former basis, but only 2.18 per cent on the latter. For the 2020
issue, the yields were 3.94 per cent and 3.82 per cent respectively.
An example of how indexation works in practice might help. The base RPI for
the 1996 issue is 67.9 (the figure for July 1980) and if the issue were
redeemed today, the relevant index would be April's 138.8 (both figures are
given on the FT prices pages, under British funds). Dividing the latter by
the former gives 2.044, so an investor who bought Pounds 1,000 of stock on
issue would be repaid Pounds 2,044. The actual price on Friday morning,
however, was 194 3/4 . So the market value of the investor's holding would
be Pounds 1,947.50. The original coupon of two per cent, or Pounds 20, would
now have more than doubled to around Pounds 41 a year.
If inflation averages five per cent between now and the repayment date of
September 1996, then the final repayment value should be around Pounds 2,380
(indexation only occurs until January 1996). So someone buying Pounds 1,000
of the stock now, would have around Pounds 1,223 on maturity; plus an income
of just over two per cent a year.
For the 2.5 per cent 2001 issue, the repayment date is September of that
year. If inflation averages five per cent between now and then, someone
buying Pounds 1,000 of stock would get around Pounds 1,645 on maturity, and
a taxable income of a little over 2.5 per cent a year in the interim.
These are not spectacular gains (and indeed inflation could be lower than
five per cent); in the short term, there is always the risk that
index-linked prices might fall (especially if the government floods the
market with new issues). But the prospect of tax-free profits from the
government ought to make many investors consider index-linked as a core
holding in their portfolios.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Fortune favours the cautious - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTUNE is said to favour the brave, but a cautious approach has helped to
turn First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions
group, into one of the classiest acts in the hard-hit leisure sector.
While many groups expanded rapidly during the 1980s, only to collapse under
the burden of debt when the consumer spending boom ended, First Leisure was
careful to keep its gearing low.
The company nevertheless used its strong cashflow to invest heavily in large
discotheques, both in city centres and new edge-of-town sites, and its
resorts, such as the Blackpool Tower, pier and Winter Gardens.
John Conlan, chief executive, has also helped bring 10-pin bowling up to
date with the group's Super Bowl sites. These aim to attract families, with
simple scoring systems, fast food and electronic games.
The resilience of these businesses was demonstrated this week when First
Leisure maintained its 10-year record of profits growth. Even more
impressive, in spite of what it described as 'increasingly adverse trading
conditions', the group reported a slight increase in its net profit to sales
margin of 29 per cent.
First Leisure started in 1983 as a Pounds 37.5m buy-out from Forte by Lord
Delfont. The 85-year-old, who is still life president of the company,
stepped down as chairman last year, to be replaced by Lord Rayne, a
comparative stripling at 74. Since flotation in 1983, the group's market
value has grown more than tenfold and stands at over Pounds 500m.
Inevitably this sort of quality comes at a price. The shares trade on a
prospective multiple of nearly 20, a hefty premium to the market. The main
question concerning the group is whether it can continue to grow at this
rate, without making a significant acquisition or finding a new business
area.
Conlan emphasises the considerable scope for organic growth in the existing
businesses - particularly 10-pin bowling. The group spent Pounds 34m on
capital investment last year, and will spend as much again this year. Some
Pounds 8m of last year's total went into refurbishment of six of the group's
largest discos. The venues were closed for several months, but the group is
confident that the improvements will be justified by attracting customers
when consumer spending does recover.
The fall in property values in the south-east of England gives the group a
chance to increase its cover particularly around and within the M25, where
it has been previously been under-represented.
Lord Rayne, chairman, is enthusiastic about the group's increasing scope to
benefit, as it expands, from economies of scale in buying its drinks, goods
and equipment such as amusement machines. It is investing Pounds 3m in
electronic point of sale technology and hopes to use it to emulate large
retailers by improving margins and stock control.
To that end the group last year hired Graham Coles as finance director.
Before spending a brief spell at Amber Day, the discount retailer, Coles was
finance director for three years with BhS.
Two years ago First Leisure took its first, tentative, step into continental
Europe by buying a large discotheque in Amsterdam. The venue is trading
profitably, but Conlan said its main benefit was in training managers in a
foreign market. He is aware of the importance of understanding different
cultural backgrounds to making a success of a leisure venue. Not least for
that reason, he is likely to concentrate on the south-east of England before
venturing further into Europe.
The company has identified two possible new areas for expansion -
mass-market health and fitness clubs, and bingo. The huge high street bingo
market is carved up between Bass and Rank and neither seems a likely seller.
Conlan is interested in bringing bingo to more upmarket, edge-of-town sites.
Analysts are not sure that bingo can be transferred from its present
high-street environment of converted cinemas and the like. But one said he
knew that First Leisure would do its homework, and only make the move if it
was sure of success. That sort of confidence goes a long way to explaining
the group's premium rating.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: European bond unit trust - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Unicorn is launching a new European Bond unit trust on Monday. It
will be the first onshore unit trust aiming for total return rather than
income to invest exclusively in European markets.
According to BZW Investment Management, which will manage the trust, the
high real yields available in Europe at present are attractive (see
accompanying graph), and there is a hope of capital gain if yields converge
towards German levels. The capital value of the fund should also benefit
from cuts in German base rates, if and when they happen.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 30 per month. Initial charge
is 3.5 per cent (with a 1 per cent discount during the offer period which
lasts until January 29), and annual charges are 0.75 per cent.
Income is distributed in March and September, and the projected initial
yield is 3.5 per cent.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Sharp rise in charitable giving through Gift Aid -
At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gift Aid, the scheme which allows tax-efficient single donations to charity,
took off in the third quarter of last year, according to figures issued this
week by the Inland Revenue. Donations from individuals increased from Pounds
25m in the three months to the end of June to Pounds 37.9m, while corporate
donations rose from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 30.1m.
Average individual donations rose from Pounds 1,764 to Pounds 2,073, which
suggests that the move cannot be accounted for by the cut in the minimum
donation allowed under the scheme from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400.
The figures are included in the latest edition of The Outline Guide to
Charitable Giving and to Establishing Charitable Gift Trusts, published by
Investment and Tax Publishing Services (tel: 0234 218740), which gives full
details of the scheme. Price Pounds 48 (Pounds 42 until February 26).

FT  16 JAN 93 / The arts perform a dance of death: The Soviet heritage is
suffering under free market pressures. Gone are the lavish subsidies and the
bonds which lent excitement and discipline, pushing performers to the limits
of their art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN culture, the envy of the world during the era of Soviet repression,
is now critically ill from the effects of freedom. In all the arts for which
Russia was famed, the pride of setting international standards has been
replaced by despair or cynicism. Already, it is too late to save some parts
of the Soviet cultural heritage: for much else, the end seems near.
But why should one care about saving the cultural heritage of a brutal
regime? Did it not involve censorship of every production and KGB snoopers
on every foreign tour, in every cutting room and at every opening night?
Yes: but under communist rule the arts were also lavishly subsidised.
Standards in music, dance and theatre were kept up and a big effort was made
to spread high culture throughout society. The Soviet heritage was unfree
but within its political fetters, a culture of great excellence. That
duality helps to explain the present crisis and the nostalgia felt by many
artists for the lost era of party control.
Under the communist regime, high art was as well rewarded as popular art.
Yuri Gussman, head of Russia's Cinematographers' Union and a film director
in his native Azerbaijan, says: 'Directors making a film for three people
were paid more than the directors of the most popular musicals. Some of them
were good, some were terrible. Anyway, the market did not matter.'
Now, looking back, it is said that oppression gave energy to those who
sought to push their artistic boundaries to the limit, lending an excitement
and discipline which today's formless freedom cannot provide. Indeed, before
communism, most of Russia's great art was produced under a highly
authoritarian system.
Arkady Ostrovsky, one of Moscow's brightest young drama critics, says:
'Vladimir Visotsky (a famed protest singer of the 1970s who stayed just
within the tolerated limits) played Hamlet at the Taganka Theatre. Everyone
went to see him because he was saying something about our society. Now, the
theatre is not shocking and no one wants it to shock.'
Yet, in the first years of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy, the
intelligentsia was delighted by the progressive escape from censorship. In
the late 1980s, before the failures of economic restructuring were obvious,
it was a joy to see one veil after another whipped away: the publication of
Anatoly Rybakov's Children of the Arbat (an anti-Stalinist novel written
without hope of publication 20 years before); the performance of extracts of
Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago on a Moscow stage - for which, with a
shock, I saw a poster inside the Soviet Foreign Ministry in 1990.
It was not easy at first. When the pianist Mikhail Rudy, who defected in
1977 in his mid 20s, came back in 1989 to play with the Leningrad
Philharmonic, he found the orchestra 'glacial. . . they had not ever been
able to talk to a political exile before, and they were scared'. Yet a year
ago, he undertook a five-concert tour of Moscow and St Petersburg, as it had
become, and recorded a disc with the same orchestra.
Of the famous expatriates, only Solzhenitsyn has yet to return - and he is
held up by his own doubts about the responsibilities which will be thrust
upon him as one who has become an icon of nationalism. The composer Alfred
Shnitke, best known of contemporary Russian composers, was once
cold-shouldered by official Soviet musicology and attracted venom for being
performed abroad. Now he plays to glittering crowds and is reverentially
broadcast on Russian television.
But in the third year after Boris Yeltsin came to power, the freshness has
gone. Irina Miroshnichenko, one of Russia's foremost classical actresses and
consultant to Moscow City Council on culture says:. 'These are the hardest
of times in the arts. Much that we took for granted is now disappearing or
being destroyed. It is so distressing.'
In the theatre, provincial houses are being closed and those that remain,
concentrate on popular classics, while seeking sponsorship from foreign and
Russian businessmen. In Perm, the city's new business club sponsors a
private ballet company. In Rostov-on-Don, the city's first privatised
company buys favour by sponsoring the youth theatre and a bi-annual
children's drama festival. In Moscow, the operetta theatre round the corner
from the mighty Bolshoy is supported by the US Electra company.
The Bolshoy itself faces the hard times in better shape than most companies:
it can trade on its name, both at home and abroad. Although its
performances, especially of opera, are said to lack the old lustre, it still
puts on magnificent evenings - shown last year by its tribute to the Russian
diva Galina Vishnevskaya, with endless encores and emotional heat. It has
shaken free of the stifling embrace of Gosconcert, the state agency which
arranged its foreign tours and the performances of foreign companies on its
stage. Now it can keep the foreign currency it earns abroad.
It has engaged the services of a British marketing group, the Sporting
Partnership, which is installing a hard currency bar on the first floor,
printing Bolshoy Theatre T-shirts, setting up foreign ticket agencies and
printing a full colour programme. Most revolutionary of all, Alex Kilgour,
who runs the partnership, has persuaded the Bolshoi to divulge its programme
to the public at least one month in advance. The Bolshoy will survive.
One cannot be so optimistic about Russian cinema. Although much of its
output in the Soviet period was banal, it was at least Russian. Now, the
cinemas in its capital show almost no Russian films: a recent count of 48
showed only three to be Russian-made; of the rest, 25 were from the US,
seven from western Europe, six from Latin America and the rest from other
countries.
The films included The Great American Cheerleader Hijack from the US, in
which has-been football stars kidnap cheerleaders and hold them to ransom;
Sex Slaves from France, in which police uncover a crime ring which sells
girls to rich Arabs; and Red Heat, also from the US, in which Arnold
Schwarzenegger plays a Moscow policeman on the trail of Georgian drug
smugglers with the help of a Chicago cop.
Among the most celebrated of the contemporary Russian film makers is
Stanislav Govorukhin, for his two long documentary films This is no Life and
The Russia we Lost - alternately lyrical and angry evocations of a wonderful
past and a diseased present. Yet The Russia We Lost played in one small
cinema in Moscow this summer after its release, and then disappeared.
Govorukhin's work, nostalgic and nationalistic, points to one direction for
the arts in modern Russia - an attempt to rediscover the old Russian culture
which was overlaid by the Soviet orthodoxy and is now being hounded into
minority enclaves by commercial pressures.
It is music, however which is in the worst predicament. Russian musical
talent, especially pianists and violinists, dominated 20th century concert
halls. Most of the artists passed through the legendary Moscow Conservatoire
 -a place of frighteningly high standards and mystical discipline, where the
best teachers led lives of deliberate obscurity, the finest of them never
performing in public and eschewing a concert career for the craft of musical
pedagogy. Igor Ketakic, a talented Serb pianist in his early 20s, now
finishing his Conservatoire course, says: 'Coming here ten years ago, I
caught the end of the great tradition - the tradition begun by Leopold Auer
in Petersburg, going through Heifetz, Jankelevich, Perelman. (Laruissa)
Glazaraova (still at the Conservatoire) was my teacher and she was one of
the last greats. Now you can buy your way in and buy your way on, now you
give a video recorder to the teacher to persuade him to take you. It is all
lost.'
Yuri Rozum, a Russian pianist now becoming internationally known after a
period in which the KGB prevented him from travelling,says: 'There is a
Russian school of piano and violin teaching which is quite distinctive. It
set a standard. There is no question it is getting less distinctive now. We
are losing our people abroad'.
Rozum spends more time on the German and Italian circuits, although his home
is a self-built dacha just outside Moscow, to which he commutes in a
Mercedes.
Some of this is simply Russia entering into world show business - with stars
moving freely between the great stages. But it also represents a loss for
the country, since the great stages of Russia are impoverished. The few
stars who visit Russia are either emigres returning for a dewy-eyed tour,
such as the Moscow Virtuosi, who now live in Spain, or foreigners coming for
free. A recent newspaper article congratulated the Austrian pianist Leonid
Brumberg, the Spanish guitarist Carlos Trepat and the Israeli conductor Itai
Talgam for appearing 'without demanding high fees in hard currency'.
But many who do come find as much chaos in the new artistic world as in
Russia's politics and economics. What should have been last summer's premier
event, a grandly conceived operatic pageant in Red Square lasting a week,
turned into a fiasco. It was badly-organised, ill-attended and over-policed.
Resentful Moscovites glared into a square one-quarter filled with foreigners
barely attending to such superstars as Jose Carreras, Marylin Horne, Leo
Nucci and Margaret Price. Omari Sokhadze, who conceived the venture, is
still disputing the costs with the Russian and Moscow city governments.
This is one of the malign consequences of freedom: the submission of what
was formerly judged on political grounds to the sometimes harsher verdict of
the market.
Irina Miroshnichenko, in her pleasant central Moscow flat, puts it this way:
'There was censorship before, of course, but there was a lot of freedom to
do the greatest plays in different ways.
'There was a lot of innovation, and every town, almost, had its theatre or
even opera house. Now, everything is commercial. Some things should be, of
course, but in art, not everything.' She has not escaped: she is building an
apparently successful second career as a singer, with a Piaf-like number
called Ah, Tak Zhal, or, in the French, Quel Dommage.
Oleg Bakliashvili, another of Russia's best-known stage presences and a
Russian parliamentarian, made the same point in parliament: 'Russian culture
is on the verge of destroying itself. Having welcomed the market, artists
now demand protection from it.'
There is only a small literature or drama of the new times. The contemporary
drama by Alexander Galin, Sorry, about Jewish emigres is one example, but a
production of On Golden Pond by the US dramatist Ernest Thompson proved more
popular with Moscow audiences.
The American play's setting amid a wealthy family faced with the problems of
age recalls the plot of the comically crude Mexican soap opera, The Rich
Also Cry. This commands the largest audiences of any TV show from Brest to
Vladivostock: the popularity of both reveal a deep need to escape to a
fantastic world.
For much of this century, Russian art was mummified in the socialist-realist
forms favoured by Soviet leaders. It became less propagandist as the years
went on, but kept at least a subliminal moral message and avoided themes
such as criminality or overt criticism of the Communist party.
Now the republics, including Russia, have begun a search, sometimes frenzied
and discriminatory, for their own forms. This has often led them to kick out
Russian cultural centres, as, for example, when the Latvian government
closed down the famous Russian Youth Theatre in Riga.
Despite the restrictions, Soviet art at the beginning of the century showed
an extraordinary inventiveness, especially the plastic arts, walled up and
covered over with pseudo-classical heroics and Gothic imperialism.
Vigour and inventiveness was shown also by its finest musicians such as
Shostakovich and film-makers such as Eisenstein, even though they were
openly and humiliatingly brought to heel.
But the first products of the new freedom, such as the films of Govorukhin,
are dour and resentful, most brilliant when evoking loss and dislocation.
It is unthinkable that such a fantastically rich culture could be
permanently exhausted, but its recovery has yet to begin.

FT  16 JAN 93 / The Long View: Ride down Gilt Mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUR UK edition of the FT is costing you an extra 5p this week at 65p, but
will it soon set you back 76p by courtesy of Norman Lamont? The chancellor
has a fair chance of finding ways to escape from his daunting problems this
year, but somebody will have to pay. It could be you (and me).
The New Year started badly in the securities markets in London, with profits
being taken in equities and long-dated gilt-edged yields climbing back up to
9 per cent as the announcement of next week's gilt auction has provided an
early reminder of the coming flood of paper.
On the other hand yesterday's drop in the inflation index to 2.6 per cent,
though entirely dependent on falling mortgage rates, gave a reminder of the
kind of short-term opportunities that the politicians will be able to
exploit this year.
Meanwhile, the pound sterling has bounced firmly off Dollars 1.50 at the
beginning of the month, and sterling has been able to watch the latest round
of speculative pressure on the European exchange rate mechanism from a
distance. The ERM has survived, because the markets are now discounting a
significant cut in German interest rates this year; the French franc need
not be devalued against the D-mark because the D-mark has depreciated by 15
per cent against the dollar since the height of the currency crisis last
September.
From the British point of view the danger is that gains in competitiveness
in Continental markets might be significantly eroded, which could be awkward
now that recovery has become the main official economic objective. Although
there is some nervousness in official quarters about cutting interest rates
again so soon, before the response of the economy can be properly judged -
it is just two months since base rates dropped to 7 per cent - this is a
card which Lamont will want to play, possibly in his March 16 Budget.
The big financial problem, remember, is that the government will need to
sell Pounds 50bn or more of gilts in the 1993-94 financial year. This is
more than can be readily financed out of regular savings flows within the
British economy so there will have to be some reliance on shifts in holdings
of existing financial assets, and on investment by foreigners. In a
catastrophic scenario the Bank of England would be raising gilt yields to
whatever level was required to entice pension funds into dumping equities,
but fortunately we are a long way from that 1970s-type crisis point.
All the same, it looks increasingly inevitable that Norman Lamont will have
to resort to escape route one, a switch to underfunding. This is jargon for
saying that the government will finance part of its deficit through the
banking system. Essentially the banks will shift a proportion of their
assets into the public sector: at present British banks have only 3 per cent
of their portfolios in public sector assets, whereas in the US, where the
government has been underfunding like crazy, the banks have 22 per cent.
Escape route two is likely to be a low level of short-term interest rates.
Six months ago long-term rates were lower than short rates, now they are two
percentage points higher, and the bigger that gap becomes the easier it will
be to sell gilts. Low interest rates will also serve to weaken sterling
which is important if substantial sales are to be made to foreigners: they
will not buy gilts unless they are convinced that sterling is at a bargain
basement level from which it is more likely to rise than to depreciate
further. Alternatively the government could borrow in foreign currencies,
but that would only highlight the lack of confidence in the pound.
There are important limitations on the scope for cutting sterling interest
rates, however. Already the building societies are tending to suffer a net
loss of savings and they surely could not follow money market rates down
much below 6 per cent. The banking sector became bloated through high
deposit rates in the 1980s but could be nastily squeezed by low rates now -
although it would be open to the building societies to finance mortgage
lending through longer-term savings products. While instant access accounts
might yield little, five-year fixed-rate bonds could offer a lot more. But
this does not look like a year in which it will be much fun running a
building society.
Lamont's third escape route could be through tax increases. Lenders are much
happier when they think the borrower does not really need the money - but
nobody wants to lend to a desperate man. Above all, the gilt market will
want to be able to see a way in which the budget deficit can shrink in
1994-95. In any case, fiscal tightness is an appropriate counterweight to
monetary relaxation.
This government will not increase income tax, as it probably should, but a
temporary dip in the headline inflation rate in the early part of this year
would give a window for an extension of the coverage of value-added tax. The
sins of the press could be punished at last; and those children's clothing
lobbyists had better polish up their heartstring-plucking arguments.
So the Treasury's escape committee should have reasonable scope for
initiatives this year. The funding requirements are demanding, but we start
from the relatively strong position of an historic government debt burden of
only 36 per cent of GDP: this is nothing like Italy, where the corresponding
figure is over 100 per cent. The trouble is, each tactical shift could
weaken the room for manoeuvre in the longer term. In particular, there is no
anti-inflationary anchor now that we have left the ERM, in last year's
death-defying policy switch.
You need to be smart and lucky to be a successful escapologist. And even
Harry Houdini turned out in the end to have a soft underbelly.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Italian authorities arrest alleged top Mafia chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN authorities yest-erday achieved a breakthrough in the fight
against organised crime with the capture of Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina,
acknowledged to be the boss of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the
Sicilian Mafia.
Mr Riina, who has been on the run since 1969, is wanted in connection with
some 80 killings. Police believe he was behind the assassination last year
of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo
Borsellino.
'This is an extraordinary blow (to the Mafia) and we hope this arrest will
have significant repercussions,' said Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior
minister. 'The Mafia has not been beaten but we have arrested a very
dangerous mafioso,' he added. Some 16 leading figures are still on the run.
Mr Riina's arrest exemplifies the determination of the government of Mr
Giuliano Amato to combat organised crime and break the long-standing
protection given to the Mafia by elements of the Italian state and among the
political parties.
The arrest was made in Palermo when special units of the Carabinieri stopped
a Citroen in which Mr Riina was driving with another person. Mr Riina
presented false papers but offered no resistance. In the style of a true
Mafia boss, he was unarmed.
Earlier this week, Mr Mancino told journalists his main objective this year
was the capture of Mr Riina. The fact that he was arrested in Palermo
confirmed what many Mafia experts suspected - in spite of being Italy's most
wanted criminal, he felt he had enough protection to remain in his native
Sicily. Furthermore, police had previously said they believed he had
undergone plastic surgery; but photographs showed that the 62-year-old Mafia
boss had merely aged.
Mr Giuseppe Ayala, an investigating magistrate and close friend of Falcone
and Borsellino, said: 'It is a big blow but a certain bitterness remains
given that Mr Riina was arrested in Palermo after being more than 20 years
on the run. This was not luck; but showed if you want to do something in
earnest, it can be done . . . if only it had been done earlier.'
The son of a poor smallholder, Mr Riina has been involved in organised crime
since his early teens and married into one of the traditional Mafia families
of Corleone. On the run for more than 40 years, the only time he was caught
he escaped from house arrest in 1969 near Bologna.
Nicknamed 'Toto the short', Mr Riina was first identified in 1984 as the new
head of the cupola, the council representing 14 leading Sicilian clans, by
Mr Tommaso Buscetta. Mr Buscetta was the first top member of Cosa Nostra to
break with the code of omerta (silence) and agree to turn state's evidence
after his clan had been defeated in a bloody power struggle, won by Mr Riina
and his Corleone clan.
Greater protection and incentives granted last year to repentant mafiosi -
pentiti - have encouraged more Mafia members to give evidence against their
bosses. This is believed to have played an important part in the
government's recent successes in capturing leading Mafia figures. Among
those talking under special protection is Mr Riina's former chauffeur. Mr
Riina is reported to have created many enemies by his rejection of the
traditional consensual way of dealing with the main Cosa Nostra clans.
Instead, he imposed a bloody dictatorial rule enforced by an army of some
500 gunmen.
Buoyed by the enormous profits from the international drugs trade during the
1980s, he abandoned the old policy of seeking an accommodation with the
state, escalating confrontation with schemes for promoting an independent
Sicily. The most dramatic instances of challenging the state were the
murders of Falcone and Borsellino.
These killings were the catalyst in forcing the authorities to act with
greater determination, in turn prompting more people to inform on the Mafia.
The authorities have also begun to arrest politicians in Sicily, seize
assets, disband Mafia-controlled municipalities and deploy the army in
force.
The authorities warned that Cosa Nostra might counterattack violently to
remind Italians that the organisation's fate did not depend upon the fate of
Mr Riina.

FT  16 JAN 93 / BA employees protest at 'dirty tricks' affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS employees have bitterly attacked the company's role in the
Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair in the airline's weekly staff
newspaper.
A series of critical letters published yesterday in British Airways News
included calls for the resignation of BA directors and the dismissal of all
those responsible for the 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin.
The letters reflected the dismay and demoralisation that has swept the
company since BA apologised to Virgin in the High Court on Monday and agreed
to pay Mr Richard Branson and Virgin Pounds 610,000 in libel damages.
Virgin had accused BA of going 'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable
practice' in a campaign to discredit its rival.
Mr Derek Porter, a priority spares controller at Hatton Cross, wrote that he
hoped 'the perpetrators of this obscene episode are brought to justice'.
Those responsible should be instantly dismissed, he added.
Captain Peter Jenkinson, a Boeing 757/767 pilot, argued that the claim by
directors that they did not know what was going on was 'difficult to
believe'.
He recalled an earlier instance of a director stepping down after accepting
responsibility for events of which he had no knowledge at the time. 'Surely
the same rules apply today and the responsible parties must accept their
grave mistakes and take the consequences,' he wrote.
Mr Gary Moore, a product development co-ordinator, said he hoped 'heads will
roll' not only of those who planned the malpractice but also of those
involved in what appeared to be a cover-up attempt.
Although some staff wrote to support BA's management led by Lord King,
chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive and deputy chairman,
others said the company's credibility had been damaged and that they felt
humiliated and ashamed.
Mr Will Herlihy, a senior fleet engineer at Heathrow airport, said: 'Let's
now all make sure it can never happen again.'
Sir Colin yesterday wrote in the same paper that BA was taking 'fair but
effective and appropriate action' to ensure there would be no recurrence of
the affair. He said BA intended to build a 'new and less confrontational
relationship' with Virgin. 'The means, the only means, by which we have
achieved our success is to have consistently delivered a better standard of
service than our competitors,' he added.
BA is expected to revive soon a partnership deal with USAir, the US carrier.
BA last month abandoned a proposal to acquire a 44 per cent stake in the
airline but is now expected to propose taking a 10 to 15 per cent stake.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Big power users to voice fears on possible ICI deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK electricity industry and large power consumers are to relay their
concerns to the government over reports that Imperial Chemical Industries
may be given special permission to buy electricity at below market rates.
The Energy Intensive Users Group, which includes some of the largest
companies in the UK, is to see Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, early next
week. A spokesman for British Steel, which belongs to the group, said his
company wanted to learn more of the government's plans.
Members of the electricity pool, the regulated market through which all
electricity has to be sold, have decided to write to the Department of Trade
and Industry about the reports.
Although the DTI stresses that no decisions have been taken, it is believed
to be considering a plan to allow ICI to bypass the pool and buy power
direct from a generator.
This could save it up to 20 per cent on its electricity bills. ICI says that
unless it can buy power more cheaply, it may have to shut down its chlorine
plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, with the loss of 7,000 jobs.
Mrs Margaret Thompson, the pool's chief executive who will be sending the
letter, said yesterday that members felt the pool was 'a big and complicated
issue', and they wanted to ensure that the DTI understood the implications
of making an exemption.
The pool's 30 members, representing generators and distributors, are worried
that the government could create an unwelcome precedent. They are already
under pressure from their customers to match any ICI deal.
The pool was established in the late 1980s, before the privatisation of the
electricity industry. Prices are set every half-hour throughout the day on
the basis of bids placed by power stations.
The price paid by the pool includes charges for running the electricity
system and ensuring that enough capacity is available to meet peak demands.
Power sold through the pool also incurs the nuclear levy, adding about 10
per cent to electricity bills.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Frenchman to become chairman of Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Fitzpatrick yesterday resigned as chairman of Euro Disney, which
has faced speculation about its performance since the opening of the
FFr4.2bn (Pounds 510m) EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April.
He will be succeeded by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 42, a Frenchman who
orchestrated the development of hotels and property around the park. He
joined Euro Disney in 1988 from Accor, one of France's largest hotel and
leisure companies.
The news was greeted by a jump in Euro Disney's share price. The shares
closed 28p higher at 778p in London and FFr2 higher at FFr66 in Paris.
Euro Disney denied that the departure of Mr Fitzpatrick, 52, was related to
reports that the park was failing to meet its targets for attendance and
merchandise sales. It said Mr Fitzpatrick wanted to hand over to an
indigenous European management team, having completed the park's launch.
There had been speculation about his future at Euro Disney since September
when he ceded part of his responsibilities by making Mr Bourguignon
president in his place and becoming chairman.
Mr Fitzpatrick plans to set up a consultancy in Paris but will remain on
Euro Disney's management board.
Mr Fitzpatrick formerly worked for Walt Disney, the US leisure and
entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. He became
president of the European company in 1987.
EuroDisneyland was originally expected to attract 11m visitors in its first
year. Euro Disney has refused to disclose specific figures but recently
confirmed that the park, which was visited by 7m people in its first six
months, would probably fall about 500,000 below target for attendance in its
first full year.
Merchandise sales, and occupancy levels at EuroDisneyland's five hotels,
have also fallen below expectations.

It seems a brazen move on the part of First National Finance Corporation to
launch a rights issue after two years of losses which have seen group net
assets shrink to Pounds 135m from Pounds 217m. Nor does it look good for the
company that its plans were so widely trailed by the press in advance. The
rights issue, which takes the form of convertible preference shares, carries
unusually seductive terms, a gross yield of 9.3 per cent and a conversion
price actually below last night's close. The immediate assumption could thus
be that this is a cynical rescue issue in which shareholders will eventually
find the promised resumption of dividends is being paid out of their own
money. That would be unfair.
Although the parent company does need to bolster its balance sheet, the
consumer credit division at last has a recovery story to tell - witness the
turnround from loss of Pounds 12.8m in the first half of last year to profit
of Pounds 8.2m in the second. The risky lending of the late 1980s is being
increasingly replaced with new, better quality loans, but - thanks to the
absence of competition - margins are holding up. They should increase
further in the current year since lower money market rates have reduced the
cost of financing fixed rate consumer loans.
Quite how far this will benefit 1992-93 results is hard to predict. There
remain considerable problems with the commercial loan division which still
has a net loan book of Pounds 262m after provisions. About Pounds 5m of the
second-half consumer lending profits may not recur. The consumer credit
division still relies on its ability to securitise its loan book in order to
pay off bank borrowings. At least, in its anxiety to ensure success, the
company has offered any shareholders who remain nervous rights which they
can sell at a profit in the market.

<TEXT>
Investors in Euro Disney are hardly paying Mr Robert Fitzpatrick a
compliment by marking up its shares some 4 per cent on news of his
departure. They could easily be overestimating the significance, though, of
what is primarily a symbolic change. Having a French manager at the top,
especially one with the business skills of Mr Philippe Bourguignon, may make
a difference. The company appears to be signalling a new determination in
dealing with the disappointments that have marked its first year of
operation. That does not make its problems any less daunting.
There are limits to the extent to which Euro Disney can compensate for lower
than expected visitor numbers by cutting costs. Now that the pattern of
visitor flows has been established, Mr Bourguignon can perhaps adjust some
running expenses accordingly, but he can do little about the high fixed
costs including the need to service long-term borrowings of FFr 6.2bn. The
most promising approach appears to be an attempt to drum up additional
business by aggressive marketing, above all in France, where public interest
has proved lukewarm.
Even if he succeeds, shareholders may not realise much benefit. The company
still faces a large burden of deferred payments to Walt Disney in the US
which will be a continuing drag on its share price. But Walt Disney has
little incentive to change the arrangements as that would only upset its own
shareholders.

The UK stock market was always likely to pause for breath early this year
after its Christmas sprint, but it has tired more quickly than some
ex-pected. Yesterday's news of a 0.1 per cent rise in the underlying
inflation rate in December was worse than predicted. Some dispiriting
corporate news from normal stalwarts such as Guinness has unsettled
sentiment. The market is beginning to twitch at the prospect of the
much-rumoured wave of rights issues, to say nothing of concerns over the
government's Pounds 1bn-a-week borrowing programme.
As a result, the FT-SE 100 index has now shed 3 per cent since the beginning
of the year. The outlook may be drab for a while to come. One development
that might drive it higher is a cut in interest rates. But after yesterday's
inflation figures the chancellor may not have the nerve to pre-empt any
moves from the Bundesbank, especially since the pound has slipped to DM2.50.
Any premature move could put pressure on his inflation targets in the second
half of the year.
The one consolation is that bottom-up earnings forecasts from industry
sector analysts are more optimistic than the prevailing top-down projections
from economists. If the corporate reporting season reveals that the former
are right, the market might take heart. In the meantime, the best turnover
may come from switching out of the highly-rated recovery stocks into
defensive sectors.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Frenchman to become chairman of Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>

MR Robert Fitzpatrick yesterday resigned as chairman of Euro Disney, which
has faced speculation about its performance since the opening of the
FFr4.2bn (Pounds 510m) EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last April.
He will be succeeded by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 42, a Frenchman who
orchestrated the development of hotels and property around the park. He
joined Euro Disney in 1988 from Accor, one of France's largest hotel and
leisure companies.
The news was greeted by a jump in Euro Disney's share price. The shares
closed 28p higher at 778p in London and FFr2 higher at FFr66 in Paris.
Euro Disney denied that the departure of Mr Fitzpatrick, 52, was related to
reports that the park was failing to meet its targets for attendance and
merchandise sales. It said Mr Fitzpatrick wanted to hand over to an
indigenous European management team, having completed the park's launch.
There had been speculation about his future at Euro Disney since September
when he ceded part of his responsibilities by making Mr Bourguignon
president in his place and becoming chairman. Mr Fitzpatrick plans to set up
a consultancy in Paris but will remain on Euro Disney's management board.
Mr Fitzpatrick formerly worked for Walt Disney, the US leisure and
entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. He became
president of the European company in 1987.
One of the more off-beat tasks he undertook at Disney in the US was dressing
up as Goofy, the cartoon dog, and going around the Magic Kingdom theme park.
He explained that all Disney employees did a spell in animal costume to meet
the public and understand the business.
EuroDisneyland is the most expensive leisure complex yet to be built in
Europe. It was originally expected to attract 11m visitors in its first
year.
The company has refused to disclose specific figures, but it recently
confirmed that the park, which was visited by 7m people in its first six
months, would probably fall about 500,000 below target for attendance in its
first full year.
Merchandise sales and occupancy levels at EuroDisneyland's five hotels have
also fallen below expectations.
Euro Disney has cancelled plans for further property development around the
park because of the precarious state of the Paris property market. This has
led to a shortfall in projected capital gains, thereby increasing its
financial costs.
Euro Disney recently ann-ounced a pre-tax loss of FFr399m for the year to
September 30. Analysts expect heavier losses for the current financial year
which will, for the first time, include the slack winter months.

FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow volatile as derivatives
contracts close
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended mixed to firmer yesterday as the expiration of key
stock index options made for a volatile trading session, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.24 at 3,271.12, well
below its high of 3,285.18. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 1.21 higher at 437.15, while the Amex composite finished up 2.59 at
403.65, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.68 at 698.38, another record close.
Trading volume on the NYSE was heavy at 308m shares.
The Dow opened slightly weaker, moved to a double-digit gain by mid-morning
and then dropped back to unchanged levels around midday. The index continued
to fluctuate during the afternoon, gaining 17 points before falling sharply
in the last 90 minutes. After an initial decline similar to the Dow's, and
despite weakness in the key technology sector, secondary stocks posted solid
gains throughout the day before losing ground in the final hour.
Traders said the volatility was linked to the morning expiration in the
Chicago derivatives markets of S&amp;P 500 options and S&amp;P Midcap options, and
the afternoon expiration of options on other indices and on some individual
equities.
The day's most important economic figures were broadly positive for market
sentiment. The Labor department announced that consumer prices rose by 0.1
per cent in December, a smaller increase than forecast, although slightly
offset by a weaker than expected rise in industrial output.
Among individual stocks, Westinghouse Electric slumped Dollars 1 to Dollars
13 3/4 in turnover of 3.5m shares on news that discussions between the
company and General Electric about GE buying Westinghouse's credit unit had
been terminated. The news left GE Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 84 3/4 .
IBM fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 1/4 after Standard &amp; Poor's slashed its
rating for the computer group's senior debt. IBM is due to report its
fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Wall Street is expecting a small
operating loss for the period, not including the large restructuring charge
already announced.
Other big technology stocks were mostly weaker as investors took profits
after Thursday's gains. Hewlett-Packard dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72
7/8 , Texas Instruments eased Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 and Digital
Equipment slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4
after announcing fiscal first-quarter profits of Dollars 161.3m, down
slightly from a year ago. Microsoft, which reported second-quarter earnings
of Dollars 236m late on Thursday, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 89 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO ended steady for the fourth day this week, in continued active
trading.
The TSE-300 index ended 2.74 points higher at 3,306.58 in volume of 45.9m
shares valued at CDollars 443m, according to preliminary data.
Advances edged declines by 306 to 305.
Among the sub-indices, mining posted a modest increase, financial services,
consumer products and golds were flat and energy and industrial products
declined.

FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Nordic bourses hopeful after extremes
of 1992 - But there are reasons why analysts are only cautiously optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nordic stock exchange performance diverged strongly in 1992. The region
produced the worst performer in Denmark, which registered a 26 per cent fall
on the FT-Actuaries index, as well as two of the more notable 'winners',
with Sweden up 16.63 per cent and Finland up 12.85 per cent. Norway came in
between these extremes with a decline of 10.67 per cent.
These, however, are just the local currency figures. A different picture
emerges when performance is assessed in dollar terms, highlighting the
effect of the devaluations which Finland, Sweden and Norway were forced to
carry out last year. On this basis, Sweden dropped 8.6 per cent and Finland
by 10.78 per cent, and the falls in both Oslo and Copenhagen were further
exacerbated.
Common factors were shared by all four markets. These included weak
international demand, high unemployment, financial sector problems, falling
real estate prices, and generally high interest rates. But whereas bourses
in Finland, Sweden and Norway registered considerable gains after these
countries floated their currencies, Denmark held firm at the price of high
interest rates, and share prices suffered accordingly. There were other
special factors, such as weak shipping markets, which had a negative
influence on both the Norwegian and Danish stock markets but virtually no
effect in Sweden and Finland.
In 1993, investors will have to stay selective, particularly in Sweden and
Finland where share prices have already rallied strongly over recent months.
Most analysts are cautiously optimistic about the outlook in all four
countries, although much will depend on what happens to the world economy
and domestic interest rates. One important negative influence is likely to
be the weakening state of demand in Germany, the most important export
market for both Denmark and Sweden.
In Denmark, the market's short-term concerns will be political, following Mr
Poul Schluter's resignation as prime minister over the Tamil refugees
scandal. But a second Maastricht vote is also looming on the horizon and the
hope is that a 'yes' vote will be as positive for the market this year as
last June's 'no' was damaging for sentiment.
In 1992, share prices on the Copenhagen stock exchange never recovered from
this blow, although the real damage was done later in the year when currency
turmoil forced Denmark to raise its interest rates and competitor countries
to devalue. That left Danish exporters uncompetitive and put the domestic
economy under considerable strain.
There were other negative influences: losses in the banking sector, for
example, and the collapse of one of the country's main insurers, Hafnia.
This year, financial sector problems are expected to continue, but the
corporate sector should benefit from recent restructuring and lower import
prices, and domestic demand is expected to pick up.
The biggest worry will be the outlook for exports, if the krona remains at
its current level.
Helsinki was due for a revival in 1992, after its poor showing in recent
years; but this only manifested itself late in the year, once interest rates
started to move down decisively following the decision to float the markka
in September.
For much of the year, sentiment was overshadowed by recession and the
banking crisis, helping to drag the Hex index to a five and a half year low
of 548 on September 4; after that share prices surged by more than 50 per
cent by December 30.
While this suggests that the revival may not have much further to go, a
number of positive influences are still working in Finland's favour. They
include an improving economic outlook - GNP is set to grow by some 1 per
cent this year - the recent removal of restrictions on foreign share
ownership and more equitable tax treatment of capital gains.
Stockholm's Affarsvarlden General index, more broadly based than its
FT-Actuaries equivalent, ended 1992 at 912, exactly where it began. But that
disguised three distinct phases: a rise to 1,000 on May 11; a tumble of 36
per cent by October 5; and a recovery which produced a 42 per cent increase
from the bottom by the year-end.
The feeling is that the index may struggle to make further headway in the
near future, given the dire state of the domestic economy, the continuing
banking crisis and the fact that much of the projected rise in profits for
the big exporters has already been discounted by recent rises.
A devaluation of just 5 per cent in the value of the Norwegian krone meant
the impact on share values in Oslo was less spectacular than in either
Stockholm or Helsinki, and the country's total index fell by 10 per cent to
372 during the year.
Weak freight markets, which brought the shipping index down 34.9 per cent to
308 in 1992, were a big factor.
The banking sector, which took a severe pummelling in 1991, only fell a
further 1.1 per cent in spite of its continuing problems, but the insurance
sector was depressed by the poor performance and eventual collapse of Uni
Storebrand, the country's leading insurer.
In 1993, the shipping sector should benefit from a stronger dollar and
improved market conditions. It is also expected to be the year in which the
long-running crisis in the Norwegian banking sector finally starts to turn.
This has left market analysts confident of an improvement in share prices,
although they may not materialise until the second half of the year when
interest rates should be lower.

FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls after
China statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Rim markets saw mixed performances yesterday, while Tokyo was closed
for a national holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
HONG KONG ended a four-day rally as investors reacted to another hardline
statement by China on Hong Kong and to profit downgrades for HSBC Holdings.
The Hang Seng index closed 18.36 lower at 5,871.80, up 6.2 per cent on the
week, in turnover of more than HKDollars 3bn.
The dip in HSBC - which accounts for 15 per cent of the Hang Seng index -
also pulled the overall market down. The stock fell 50 cents to HKDollars
60.00 while Hang Seng Bank rose 50 cents to HKDollars 57.00.
AUSTRALIA was lifted by strong blue chips. The All Ordinaries index closed
up 17.0 at 1,524.5, a gain of 1 per cent on the week, in turnover of
ADollars 259m.
News Corp advanced 74 cents to ADollars 28.44 after a strong overnight
performance in the US. ANZ gained 5 cents to ADollars 3.08 after forecasting
good earnings in 1993.
Foster's rose 8 cents to ADollars 1.34 on the sale of 10 per cent of its
Canadian brewing operations to Miller Brewing, the US group. BHP, which has
a majority shareholding in Foster's, advanced 20 cents to ADollars 13.12.
SINGAPORE closed higher on selective buying. The Straits Times Industrial
Index rose 14 to 1,572.40, up 1 per cent on the week, in volume of 78.2m
shares against 84.5m on Thursday.
Malaysian companies traded over the counter continued to ease on
expectations of a slowdown in the Malaysian economy.
SEOUL closed slightly higher after fluctuating narrowly during the day, with
buying of small-capitalisation shares more than compensating for a sell-off
in financials and big manufacturers. The composite index closed 1.06 higher
at 693.29, down 1.6 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won616.8bn after
Won724.5bn.
TAIWAN ended well off its day's high on profit-taking after surging in early
trade on expectations of a cut in the stock transaction tax. The weighted
index, which was up more than 80 points at one stage, ended 17.27 higher at
3,314.83, for a gain of 4.5 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to TDollars
16.8bn, the highest since last October, from Thursday's TDollars 11.8bn.
MANILA fell on profit-taking with the composite index closing 8.0 lower at
1,312.55, barely changed on the week. Losers led gainers 28 to 11, with 25
issues unchanged as turnover declined to 129m pesos from Thursday's 140m
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as some investors returned in the
afternoon on renewed rumours that interest rates were to be lowered.
The composite index closed down 2.32 at 617.49, 1.9 per cent lower on the
week. Sime Darby rose 16 cents to MDollars 4.68 on news that Malaysia Mining
Corp had sold 27m shares in the group at MDollars 4.50 each.
BANGKOK closed higher, buoyed up by the market leader Bangkok Bank. But
other big banks came under selling pressure after their recent advance. The
SET index rose 5.38 to 943.59, up 2.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of
Bt8bn.
Bangkok Bank, which reported higher 1992 after-tax net profit on Thursday,
gained Bt3 to Bt112 and was the most active stock of the day. Thai Farmers
Bank and Krung Thai Bank both lost Bt4 to Bt808 and Bt354 respectively.
NEW ZEALAND was slightly firmer in low volume, with the NZSE-40 index
closing 8.12 higher at 1,517.17. Turnover stood at NZDollars 9.7m.
Telecom was unchanged at NZDollars 2.35, Carter Holt Harvey rose 5 cents to
NZDollars 2.65 and Brierley rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.05.
BOMBAY rose in spite of scattered trouble in parts of the city, rocked by
Hindu-Moslem clashes which have claimed over 500 lives. The BSE index rose
65.87 to 2,525.54 as professionals said that the market had discounted the
riots, that no one was selling, and that expectations of a favourable budget
next month had lifted sentiment.

FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent firms on hopes of
lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES ended the week on a firm note encouraged by the prospect of lower
interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's traders saw a chance to reverse the downtrend of the past week
and a half, as better than expected figures from Siemens on Thursday lifted
sentiment. The DAX index ended 20.81 or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,544.55, 0.9
per cent better on the week.
Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM5.2bn. There was some short-covering, but
the triple options expiry had little influence on the cash market. Cyclicals
made the running, with Volkswagen up DM9.50 or 3.7 per cent to DM268.90,
Daimler DM12.10 higher at DM550.50 and Thyssen DM4.80 better at DM171.
Siemens rose another DM9.70 to DM588.60. In retailing, meanwhile, Douglas
extended Thursday's gains on 1992 sales figures which led Merck Finck, in
Dusseldorf, to estimate unchanged earnings of DM32 a share for 1992 and
issue a buy recommendation. The shares rose DM20 to DM446.
PARIS rose for a second day on continued domestic and foreign interest. The
CAC-40 index ended 23.54 higher at 1,827.08, down 1.3 per cent on the week,
in turnover of FFr2.9bn.
Eurotunnel remained attractive to buyers, as the stock put on FFr1.45 to
FFr34.15 in the day's heaviest volume of 4.9m shares. Euro Disney rose FFr2
to FFr66 on news of a change in chairman. Matra and Hachette continued to be
active on speculation about the terms of their merger. Matra added FFr13.30
to FFr236 while Hachette put on FFr3.55 to FFr90.85.
AMSTERDAM saw turnover lifted by the expiry of options and the CBS Tendency
index gained 0.3 to 97.7 for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week.
Publishers were active after Wolters Kluwer, up 80 cents at Fl 85.20,
restated its forecast of a 20 per cent rise in 1992 net profit and announced
the acquisition of Liber, Sweden's second-biggest publisher. Elsevier
improved 70 cents at Fl 123.30.
MADRID continued its rally with another 4.71 gain in the general index to
228.69, up 2.1 per cent on the week. Buying was concentrated on interest
rate-sensitive stocks as hopes of lower rates encouraged investors. Banco
Santander was Pta190 firmer at Pta4,700.
MILAN ended higher in active trading on the final day of the January trading
account as news of new fiscal incentives for the stock market encouraged
buying. The Comit index rose 10.44 to 478.62, up 4.8 per cent on the week,
in turnover estimated at around Thursday's heavy L386.3bn.
Generali continued to set the pace for the market - adding L1,530 to
L33,420, then rallying to L34,000 after hours.
Stet rose L90 to L2,020 after Siemens of Germany expressed interest on
Thursday in buying Stet's telecommunications equipment subsidiary, Italtel.
But Credito savings shares continued to slide on confirmation that Iri would
not allow them to be converted into ordinary shares. They fell L93 to
L1,810.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by Ericsson, up SKr4 to SKr18 in the B shares, and
hopes of lower interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index gained 4.4 to 927.0,
down 2.25 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to SKr585m from SKr866m.
Electrolux went against the trend with a fall of SKr4 to SKr233 on overseas
selling.
OSLO closed steady in moderate trading with medium-sized companies grabbing
investor interest. The all-share index edged up 0.2 at 385 points, down
slightly on the week, in turnover of NKr222m.
There was unusually heavy trade in the shipping company Norsk Amerikalinje
which closed at NKr9.40, a rise of over 9 per cent over two days.
COPENHAGEN closed higher in the wake of Prime Minister Poul Schluter's
resignation, the KFX index closing up 0.80 at 75.97. The general belief was
that a new government would not lead to drastic changes in Danish economic
policy and might even make it easier for Danes to vote 'yes' in the spring's
scheduled referendum on the Maastricht treaty.

THE MURKY recovery picture among Britain's retailers was further muddied
yesterday with two of the smaller high street groups reporting widely
different fortunes. Laura Ashley, the clothes and fabrics group, saw its
shares fall heavily after revealing a dramatic setback to its US operations
in briefings to analysts. It raised fears that the dividend, which was
passed at the interims, was unlikely to be paid for the full year.
Trading in the US reportedly dropped by up to 40 per cent at one stage in
the summer. It is believed that sales have since recovered, while in the UK
Laura Ashley told analysts that pre-Christmas sales were about 10 per cent
higher than the same period a year ago.
Despite this, analysts moved quickly to downgrade profit forecasts.
Kleinwort Benson slashed its figures for 1992-93 from Pounds 6m to Pounds 2m
 -only Pounds 320,000 more than the Pounds 1.68m profits the company made in
its first half. The shares tumbled 17 to 70p.
Tie Rack announced sales growth of 6 per cent for the year to date, which
would 'result in substantially increased earnings for the year ending 31 Jan
1993'. The shares jumped 11 to 83p.
TSB optimism
High Street bank TSB saw its shares rise on further consideration of its
results as the optimists view held sway. The shares rose 4 to 160p with 10m
traded, giving a rise of 8.5 per cent over two days.
Agency broker James Capel was an aggressive buyer of the shares, as was
securities house Hoare Govett which has raised its 1993 profit forecast by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 220m. The bull case is that TSB is either a recovery
play or a prime takeover target.
However Lehman Brothers, among others, is not convinced. The US investment
bank says: 'We would caution against expecting further significant progress
at the operating line . . . we prefer the more defensive stocks in the
sector, and of the recovery stocks would recommend a switch into Barclays.'
Barclays, which has its own detractors, was steady at 374p.
Euro Disney boosted
A surprise boardroom change at Euro Disney gave a boost to the shares but
did nothing to dispel the bearish view of many UK analysts. The shares added
28 to 778p in thin trading in London, although the stock was reported busier
in Paris. The appointment of Frenchman Mr Philippe Bourguignon, currently
the theme park's second in command, as chairman raised hopes that the park
might develop a more Eurocentric approach, and thus attract more visitors.
However, one UK leisure specialist said the appointment made no difference
to the fact that: 'the shares are far too highly rated and deserved to be
sold down to 400p.'
Vague takeover talk helped Cadbury-Schweppes to put on 7 to 459p. Hanson was
said to be eyeing the confectionery and food group after its failed bid for
RHM last year, but analysts were largely dismissive given Cadbury's high
rating and solid managerial record. Hillsdown was another name being billed
for a bid and the shares added 4 to 148p. Unilever advanced 6 to 1068p on
speculation that it will have positive news at meetings it is hosting for
analysts next week.
UK airports operator BAA was in strong demand and the shares jumped 15 to
772p. The stock advanced for the second day in a row having languished in
previous sessions on the back of disappointing traffic figures.
Most of yesterday's buying was said to have been carried out by Swiss Bank
Corporation. Mr James Halstead, the transport analyst at SBC said simply:
'The shares had been marked down so much and it presented an excellent
buying opportunity.' Turnover was just short of a million shares by the
close.
The price of BP shares slipped again on very heavy turnover of 14m shares
following a series of profit downgrades and negative broker notes on the oil
company. The shares slipped 4 to 228 1/2 p.
Lubricants and chemicals company Burmah Castrol fell 7 to 688p after UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew downgraded the company's 1993 profits forecast on growing
fears for the German economy.
UBS cut its forecast to Pounds 93m from Pounds 97m after reducing its
expectations for Germany's 1993 GDP from 0.4 per cent to 'substantially
negative growth'. Between 30 per cent and 25 per cent of Burmah's profits
are D-Mark-related.
Insurer Prudential closed 9 better at 296p on turnover of 6m as the market
responded enthusiastically to an announcement that new business increased by
13.3 per cent last year. Mr Charles Landa at Strauss Turnbull raised his
forecast for 1993 accruals profits by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn and
reinforced his buy stance.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw analysts to discuss the potential
benefits of treasury activity but its shares still fell 9 to 915p following
overnight declines on Wall Street. The stock consolidated after being pushed
up on the previous day on unsubstantiated stories that an encouraging
article was about to be published in a medical journal.
Second-line pharmaceuticals Amersham and London International rose 11 to
674p and 5 to 267p respectively on support by Hoare Govett.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel benefited from encouraging comments by
French analysts. The shares moved 12 ahead to 389p. NFC gave up 8 to 274p in
spite of a series of presentations in the City by the company.
Shares in Lucas Industries, a good market of late on bid speculation, eased
4 to 145p on a combination of profit-taking and a reported profits
downgrading by Hoare Govett.
British Aerospace continued to be boosted by reports that it would soon sign
a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace over its regional jet division. The
shares climbed another 8 to 185p. Smiths Industries put on 3 to 379p, with
NatWest Securities reported to have had the main buyer. Broker Albert E.
Sharp was said to have shown keen interest in Glynwed International. The
shares hardened 8 to 257p.
Shares in First National Finance Corp rose 11 1/2 to 68p after a positive
statement on future trading. The consumer credit group said it should see
better results this year despite posting losses for the year to October 31
of Pounds 31m. The group also announced an expected Pounds 45.8m rights
issue to cut debt.
BZW and NatWest Securities were recommending London Electricity and the
shares responded up 5 to 443p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICTING signals about a rate cut, as the equity account drew to a close,
led to a volatile session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Good demand at the outset for the March contract on the FT-SE saw it
squeezed up to 2,797 within the first hour of trading, as speculation of a
cut in base rates was heard.
But the rumours diminished as new figures showing a rise in the underlying
rate of inflation were announced, sending March drifting lower.
By 2.30pm it was at the day's low of 2,767 and looked set to fall further.
However the firm opening on Wall Street and renewed speculation that there
might just be a cut in rates after all, helped the contract regain momentum.
March finished at 2,785, around 10 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of around 14, with turnover reaching 8,311 lots.
Strong activity in two stock options accounted for the day's high turnover
of 47,202 contracts in the traded options. Some 19,412 lots were dealt in
Asda, while Barclays traded 4,960 contracts.

FT  16 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate rise hope overrides inflation
fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices ended a busy trading session in positive territory but not
before a fierce struggle to shrug off the effects of some slightly
disappointing domestic inflation numbers and the absence of a rumoured
reduction in UK interest rates.
A late rally in the equity market followed a sudden surge of mostly
overseas-sourced buying interest amid suggestions that this weekend could
bring a co-ordinated round of Europe-wide interest rate cuts. Significantly,
dealers said there had been exceptionally heavy demand for leading French
stocks, especially the banks, which they said was a strong pointer to a move
to reduce French interest rates.
Sentiment in London was additionally boosted by a healthy performance on
Wall Street. The Dow Jones was up around nine points early in the session
after a heavy batch of US economic data.
The last session of the account began with marketmakers opening share prices
marginally below overnight levels. The Footsie registered an early
three-point decline after confirmation of the first relatively sizeable
rights issue of the year, a Pounds 45m cash call from First National
Finance. The absence of any other rights issue saw a burst of buying in the
Footsie future which dragged the cash market with it. Then, support tapered
ahead of the inflation news.
The marginal increase in the underlying inflation rate was widely expected
and put paid to any lingering hopes of a UK rate cut. Subsequent flurries of
small selling drove the Footsie to its lowest level, down 9.8 points, just
in front of Wall Street's opening. It then began to recover, eventually
closing 5.9 higher at 2,765.1. Over the week, the 100 index has fallen 34.1,
or 1.2 per cent. The Footsie Mid-250 edged up 2.5 to 2890.6, a fall of 42.1,
or 1.4 per cent, on the week.
Senior dealers were guardedly optimistic about the near-term outlook for the
market. 'The feeling at the close was that perhaps we have seen the worst of
the pull-back in equities; the market has a good feel about it,' said one
trader. But he warned that there remained a strong possibility of a big
rights issue hitting the market in the short term.
US broker J P Morgan is among the more bullish of the London market. It sees
it outperforming other European markets because it offers real earnings and
dividend growth. Strauss Turnbull, however, says the market's earnings
multiple of around 17 times discounts too much good news.
Turnover was 611.1m shares yesterday. The value of business on Thursday was
Pounds 1.2bn. The value of market business has topped Pounds 1bn on every
trading day so far this year.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peace breaks out in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH krone, Irish punt and French franc appeared well underpinned
against the D-Mark yesterday, as tensions inside the European exchange rate
mechanism continued to dissipate, writes James Blitz.
At the end of a comparatively mild week for the ERM, the three currencies at
the bottom of the system's grid appeared to be in no danger of an imminent
devaluation, despite political uncertainty in their respective countries.
Mr Poul Schluter's resignation as prime minister of Denmark had no impact at
all on the krone which was at DKr3.8508 against the D-Mark yesterday
afternoon, stronger than Thursday night's London close of around DKr3.646.
The Irish punt remained above its floors against the Dutch guilder and
Belgian franc - two of the strongest ERM currencies - in spite of a drastic
cut in money market rates by the Irish authorities this week.
The French franc gained more strength against the D-Mark, rising above the
FFr3.38 level against the German currency, its highest level since November
20.
At Wednesday's meeting in Frankfurt of the privately organised G7 Council,
central bankers of countries still in the ERM claimed that the four-month
crisis in the European Monetary System was past its peak.
But there are reasons for caution.
First, interest rates in several European countries, including France,
Denmark and Ireland, remain at high levels.
There were suggestions this week that if the Bank of France does not bring
money market rates down from their level of 11 1/2 per cent, the higher
costs incurred by commercial banks may be passed to the retail sector in the
next two weeks.
The Bundesbank will be under more pressure to shave money market rates at
its council meetings on 21 January and 4 February. If it fails to respond,
the pressures on weak ERM currencies could return.
There may also be unfinished business in Scandinavia, whose currencies can
have an impact on ERM trading.
The week has been marked by a sharp fall in the value of the Swedish krona,
with the central bank intervening in support of the currency.
The Swedish authorities recently announced that their budget deficit for
1993/4 will be 11 per cent of GDP, and another fall for the krona cannot be
ruled out.
The dollar yesterday broke higher in late European trade, helped by rumours
of co-ordinated rate cuts in Europe. The dollar closed in London at
DM1.6355, up more than 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Big sterling shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the sterling money market were slightly firmer yesterday after
the Bank of England announced a large shortage at the start of its money
market operations, writes James Blitz.
The shortage of Pounds 2.05bn helped to quash any lingering expectations
that the UK authorities might be planning a cut in base rates to coincide
with the retail prices index for December.
The large shortage led to a sharp jump in the cost of borrowing money
overnight in the wholesale market, with the rate going as high as 9 per
cent.
According to one dealer, this left a few people scrambling desperately for
funds. 'A few people had got used to easier money, were short of funds and
found themselves having to borrow at higher rates than they had expected,'
he said.
As it happened, the RPI figures were generally in line with expectations,
although there was some slight disappointment at the increase in the
underlying rate to 3.7 per cent.
This factor, and the tighter liquidity, helped to push 3 month money up by
about  1/16 per cent to a close of 7 1/16 per cent. There was more
bullishness about a rate cut in the March short sterling futures contract,
which rose 2 basis points on the day to close at 93.48.
At this level, it prices 3 month money in March at 6.52 per cent, a level
which probably assumes a 50 basis point cut in interest rates over the next
two months.
In Europe, the main focus was on the French franc futures market, where the
March contract rose by 25 basis points to close at 90.35. The French
currency has performed strongly against the D-Mark all week, raising
suggestions that the crisis of the French franc may be over.
However, 3-month French cash remained high at around 11 1/2 per cent, a
level which commercial banks may find unsustainable without passing on the
higher rates to the retail sector. There were strong suggestions yesterday
that the Bank of France might re-open the 5-10 day lending window on Monday
to ease the banks position.
The German government is due to make an announcement on progress on the
solidarity pact talks next week. Growing expectations of a successful
outcome helped to push the March Euromark contract up 2 basis points to
close at 92.20.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric and GE
Capital talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric and GE Capital have terminated talks which might have
led to GE Capital buying some or all of the loan portfolio of Westinghouse's
troubled financial services unit.
Westinghouse's shares fell on the news to close at Dollars 13 3/4 , down
Dollars 1, last night. Wall Street had regarded a sale to GE as a quick and
tidy way for Westinghouse to shed the problem.
GE declined to comment further but Westinghouse said in a statement that its
finan-cial adviser, Morgan Stanley, believed that 'substantially more value
should be realised by a programme of individual and small pool sales than
the sale to GE Capital would have created'.
Westinghouse, which has been plagued by property loan problems for two
years, decided last November to get out of financial services, though it
said then it could take three years to sell off its assets.
Westinghouse said yesterday it was confident that it would achieve the
liquidations and values contained in November's plan and added that numerous
parties had expressed an interest in the financial services business.
This is the second time talks between the two companies have come to
nothing. In December 1991, GE cast an eye over the credit unit's assets, but
it was apparently interested in buying only a few of them.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pacific BBA stands firm on bid
price for Siddons
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday said it would
not increase its ADollars 88m (USDollars 59m) takeover offer for Siddons
Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group.
The announcement leaves the field clear for a rival bid by WA Deutsher, an
Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group,
which has offered shareholders ADollars 94m.
Mr Graham Kraehe, Pacific BBA managing director, said the company's ADollars
1.81 a share offer would remain open, but would not be increased or extended
beyond the existing deadline of January 27.
Mr Kraehe said the offer was 'good for the share-holders of both companies,
but any increase would not necessarily be in the best interests of Pacific
BBA shareholders'.
He said Pacific BBA intended to pursue other expansion plans with an Asian
focus. 'It is important that we allocate our resources where we expect to
gain the best long-term benefits,' he said.
The WA Deutsher offer is conditional on 90 per cent acceptance by
shareholders. It has been rejected by Siddons' board.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charge to give Dow Chemical loss
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, yesterday warned of a
disappointing fourth quarter and unveiled a Dollars 430m pre-tax charge
against 1992 earnings.
The charges are to cover restructuring moves, including job cuts and plant
closures.
Mr Enrique Falla, Dow executive vice president, said: 'Business conditions
in basic chemicals and plastics continue to remain disappointing,
particularly in Europe where margins are negative.'
This softness will be reflected in fourth-quarter results, 'which we now
expect to be weaker than previously expected', he said.
Like much of corporate America, Dow is also adopting new accounting
standards. It now expects to post of loss of Dollars 1.70 to Dollars 1.90 a
share for the whole of 1992.
In 1991, Dow took special pre-tax charges of Dollars 370m which led to a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 94m, or 35 cents a share. For the whole of
1991, Dow earned Dollars 935m or Dollars 3.46 a share.
Analysts expect group 1992 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of about 40 cents a share.
Dow said its 1992 special charges reflect asset write-offs and write-downs,
plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of business
activities globally. Costs related to workforce reductions have also been
included in the charge.
The company recently announced a management shake-up aimed at creating more
flexibility in the management structure and improving international
competitiveness.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Pacific BBA stands firm on bid price for Siddons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday said it would
not increase its ADollars 88m (USDollars 59m) takeover offer for Siddons
Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group.
The announcement leaves the field clear for a rival bid by WA Deutsher, an
Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US engineering group,
which has offered shareholders ADollars 94m.
Mr Graham Kraehe, Pacific BBA managing director, said the company's ADollars
1.81 a share offer would remain open, but would not be increased or extended
beyond the existing deadline of January 27.
Mr Kraehe said the offer was 'good for the shareholders of both companies,
but any increase would not necessarily be in the best interests of Pacific
BBA shareholders'.
He said Pacific BBA intended to pursue other expansion plans with an Asian
focus. 'It is important that we allocate our resources where we expect to
gain the best long-term benefits,' he said.
The WA Deutsher offer is conditional on 90 per cent acceptance by
shareholders. It has been rejected by Siddons' board.
Independent directors of Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, yesterday
advised shareholders to reject the increased takeover offer from Campbell
Soup. The US foods group has raised its bid from ADollars 8.80 a share to
ADollars 9.50, valuing Arnotts at just under ADollars 1.3bn.

HENRY BIRKS, Canada's oldest jewellery and giftware chain, is expected to
seek protection from creditors while it works out a financial restructuring
with outside investors, writes Robert Gibbens from Montreal.
Birks, with 120 retail outlets across Canada and a manufacturing operation,
has already pulled out of the US and closed many Canadian stores. The
company is understood to have nearly CDollars 100m (Dollars 78m) of
borrowings.
The recession is mainly responsible for Birks's problems.

sales fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ADIDAS, the German sports goods maker majority owned by Bernard Tapie
Finance of France, said its domestic earnings improved in 1992, despite
lower domestic sales, Reuter reports.
A spokesman for Adidas confirmed reports that domestic sales fell 19 per
cent to DM620m (Dollars 390m) for 1992, while domestic earnings rose. The
company's share of the German sports shoe market declined by 6 per cent to
around 35 per cent, the spokesman said.
He gave no further details of the 1992 performance ahead of publication of
the results statement, scheduled for February. For 1991 the Adidas group
made a net profit of DM50m, against DM15m a year earlier.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer acquires leading
Swedish publisher

<TEXT>
WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, has acquired Liber, Sweden's second
largest publishing house, from a group of Swedish institutional
shareholders, in a move designed partly to serve as a springboard for
expansion into other Scandinavian markets.
The acquisition will be paid for in cash but no further financial details
were disclosed yesterday. However, Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals
group which owned 28 per cent of Liber, said it would make a capital gain of
SKr350m (Dollars 48.3m) on its investment, while Nordic Capital, with 20 per
cent, said its capital gain would be SKr200m. Other Swedish institutions
sold stakes of 20 per cent or less.
Liber, which generated 1992 sales of SKr1.3bn and employs a workforce of
850, is estimated to have up to 60 per cent of Sweden's textbook market. It
is also active in legal and information publishing.
The acquisition is the first by Wolters Kluwer in Scandinavia and gives it
access to its eighth national market in Europe. The purchase will also mean
that non-Dutch activities represent around 63 per cent of Wolters Kluwer's
business, surpassing a target of 60 per cent which the company had
originally hoped to achieve in 1994.
Wolters Kluwer, which is also active in the US, had sales of Fl 2.3bn
(Dollars 1.3bn) in 1992.
Mr Cornelis Brakel, a member of Wolters Kluwer's board, described the Liber
deal as a 'springboard for possible activities and acquisitions in Norway,
Finland and Denmark'.
He said that the Swedish company could teach other Wolters Kluwer companies
about their expertise in educational publishing, while Liber itself would
benefit from the Dutch group's legal and fiscal publishing experience in the
Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany.
Wolters Kluwer remained interested in further acquisitions, particularly in
countries that will eventually join the European Community, he said.
Wessanen, the Dutch foods group, is negotiating to buy Fastfood
International (FFI), which has a Fl 165m turnover and employs 550. FFI makes
and markets frozen foods, mainly for sale in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Escada teeters on solvency
catwalk - The fashion house's struggle for survival in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESCADA clothes are still fashionable
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but shares in the German company are anything but.
Since the beginning of the year, Escada's ordinary shares have tumbled by
more than 20 per cent and at yesterday's closing price of DM108 (Dollars
66.69) they stand at about an eighth of last year's high point of DM855.
Escada has denounced the share collapse as unjustified and rebutted
widespread rumours that it was on the verge of insolvency.
However, last week the company confirmed that it is in serious financial
difficulties. A third of its equity is to be wiped out as a result of
operating losses in the year ended October, it said.
Operating losses are likely to be in the region of DM100m, following net
profits of DM45m in 1990-1991 and DM58.7m the year before. Escada said it
would have to sell one of its major subsidiaries in a bid to plug the hole
in its balance sheet.
It did not name the subsidiary, but the most likely candidate is the 80 per
cent-owned St John Knits, the high quality knitwear business bought in 1989.
Analysts calculate that the sale of the stake in the California-based
company will raise DM80m, compared to a purchase price of about DM30m.
Escada, founded by the late Mrs Margaretha Ley (she died in June last year)
and her husband Wolfgang in 1976, was one of the great success stories of
German business in the mid to late 1980s.
It was enthusiastically received when it came to the stock market in 1986
and between 1989 to 1991 its sales doubled to DM1.36bn, reflecting a
sequence of acquisitions designed to supplement the core high price labels
Escada and Laurel.
At the heart of the company's success were the clothes designed by Mrs Ley
herself and marketed under the Escada label. Flashy, bright, energetic,
colourful and expensive, they were at one with the spirit of the 1980s,
redolent of self-confidence and success.
The spirit of the age has changed, and the St John Knits clothes - expensive
but subdued - are more attuned to a time when the seriously rich do not want
to flaunt their wealth.
It is a measure of the company's difficulties that this profitable and
successful business is now up for sale.
Ironically though, it is not a falling away in demand for the Escada label
which has led to the current crisis. Analysts say that such clothes have not
lost their cachet with women for whom money is no object and the brand is
still highly sought after.
It accounted for 41 per cent of group turnover in 1991: details for 1992 are
not yet available although the company said last week that group turnover
held firm at 1991 levels despite the downturn.
As with many companies in the UK and the US, Escada owes its current
troubles as much to the after-effects of over-expansion in better days as
the downturn itself.
In 1987 it made its first acquisition with the purchase of Schneberger
followed by Kemper, a high-quality coat-maker, a year later. It also bought
the licence to distribute Cerruti in Germany plus the stake in St Johns
Knits. These deals were followed by the purchase of Blusen Neumann in 1991,
a company which makes inexpensive blouses and everyday clothes.
At the same time, Escada moved into retail, opening a network of boutiques
to sell its top products. These shops are thought to contribute DM50m to
sales.
In 1990-1991, profits fell by 23 per cent, reflecting reduced sales as
recession took effect, especially in the US. In the latter part of the last
financial year, the downturn finally caught up with the domestic German
market, taking management by surprise as the company said last week. The
more price-sensitive brands have been particularly badly hit, analysts
believe.
Profits were hit by a simultaneous 'cost explosion', as the company
struggled to integrate its acquisitions. A new logistics centre at Poing
near Munich will open this summer, two years later than planned.
The company took steps to remedy the problems - in the last six months
appointing two new board members to look after distribution and
organisation, and a thorough cost-reduction programme is underway - but this
not enough, as last week's statement showed.
Further details will be available in a shareholders' circular later this
month. It is possible that the company will be able to report a profit for
the current year if it holds St John Knitwear on its books to the year-end.
In 1993-1994, analysts think the company will be in the red again.
Thus - despite the huge fall in the share price - it could be well into 1994
before the shares once again become fashionable.

FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Molson sale nets Foster ADollars
50m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group will realise a pre-tax profit of about ADollars 50m
(USDollars 33.5m) on the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Molson Breweries,
its Canadian joint venture with Molson Companies of Toronto.
The sale, announced in North America on Thursday, is part of a three-way
deal between Australia-based Foster's, Molson Companies and Miller Brewing,
the Milwaukee beer company owned by the Philip Morris food and tobacco
group.
Foster's said it would receive CDollars 169m (ADollars 192m) for the 10 per
cent stake in Molson Breweries. Miller is buying a further 10 per cent stake
from Molson Companies, leaving the joint venture partners with 40 per cent
each.
The deal gives Miller the marketing and distribution rights to both Foster's
and Molson beers in the US. Foster's said Miller had undertaken to increase
marketing efforts for both companies' beers.
Mr Ted Kunkel, Foster's chief executive, said the deal was a response to the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalises trade between
the US, Canada and Mexico.
He said he would be 'disappointed' if the deal failed to bring about a
'significant' increase in Foster's US market share of about 1 per cent.
Mr Kunkel said the deal would reduce Molson's contribution to Foster's net
profits in the short term, but he was confident that royalty payments from
Miller would exceed the lost profits in the medium term. Foster's is
attempting to restructure itself as a pure brewing operation, but has been
unable to dispose of many non-brewing assets.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch discourage gold business
 -Week In The Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market is much more scared of central bank selling and currency
fluctuations than anything going on in the Middle East. So said one dealer
on the London bullion market, succinctly summing up a week in which Iraq
came once again under allied attack and the Dutch central bank revealed it
had sold 400 tonnes of the yellow metal worth more than Dollars 4bn over the
last few months.
Yesterday gold was fixed in the morning at a fresh seven-year low of Dollars
327.45 a troy ounce, reflecting market concern that the Dutch sales, which
were equivalent to about 20 per cent of all gold mined in the western world
last year, could lead to further selling by other central banks. Between
them they have 35,500 tonnes in their vaults, which represents 15 years of
production from today's mines.
The Dutch action did not represent a panic sale, but had been taken after
several months' deliberation, according to Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the
Union Bank of Switzerland. 'It was premeditated. It was strategic, not
tactical, yet the bank sold when the price was near seven-year lows. The
gold market will be asking: which bank will be next?'
The market reacted to Tuesday's announcement with relief that so much gold
had been quietly absorbed. The price moved above Dollars 330, but its
failure to hold above that level in the face of producer selling is causing
concern among chart watchers.
Gold closed at Dollars 327.85 a troy ounce in London yesterday, off Dollars
1.40 on the week.
The gold market is not alone in being unfazed by Wednesday's allied attack
on Iraq - two years ago the mere threat of air strikes against the country
was enough to drive oil prices sharply higher. On Wednesday the initial news
pushed Brent crude for March delivery up 30 cents, but the market quickly
retreated, and the price ended the day unchanged at Dollars 17.10 a barrel.
Production disruptions in the North Sea because of the bad weather should
also have been bullish for oil. Instead, this merely underlined the weakness
of the market. Stocks are high, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (Opec) shows little sign of staunching supply, and demand remains
depressed.
The Brent price - already down Dollars 1 since the beginning of the year -
could decline further to Dollars 16 a barrel before the mid-February Opec
meeting, some analysts predicted.
However, yesterday in late trading the March price was at Dollars 17.57,
ahead 25 cents on the day and 5 cents on the week, not so much because of
tension in the Gulf but because of the Middle Eastern tour next week by Mr
Alirio Parra, Opec president, in a search for consensus on possible
production cuts.
On the London Metal Exchange copper surrendered the gains made last week,
when three-month metal was at one stage close to Dollars 2,400 a tonne on
the back of persistent Chinese buying. But on Monday the Chinese changed
tactics and sold heavily. Speculative liquidation added to the battering,
and three-month copper dropped below Dollars 2,200 a tonne.
Analysts said further losses were possible, and would not rule out a move to
Dollars 2,000 a tonne. Last night three-month copper closed at Dollars 2,214
a tonne, down Dollars 157 on the week.
The turmoil in copper unsettled the other base metals except for aluminium,
which has been supported by news of a series of smelter cuts because of
power supply problems at the Bonneville Power Administration on the Pacific
west coast of America.
A drought in the area has forced the BPA to reduce power supplies to
smelters by 25 per cent until the end of next month. There are 10 smelters
in the area with a combined capacity of 1.5m tonnes, equivalent to about 10
per cent of western production. So far five have shut down annual capacity
totalling about 219,000 000 tonnes.
Analysts suggested that any smelters which made cuts would not restore
production for at least six months because of the cost and complexity of
shutting down potlines.
However, Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals,
part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, questioned whether the closures would
be sufficient to sustain a price rally when LME stocks were at record
levels. He also suggested that the cuts had already been discounted in the
price.
Inespal, Spain's biggest producer, yesterday announced plans to close one
production line at each of two plants for a year, but the news again failed
to impress the market.
LME warehouse stocks yesterday rose by a further 12,500 tonnes to 1.6m
tonnes. Cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,215 a tonne, up Dollars 30.5 on
the week.
In London's softs sector, cocoa has moved above the key Pounds 705-a-tonne
level. The mood in the cocoa market appears constructive, partly on chart
formations, partly on talk that Ivory Coast is already well sold, and partly
on the high level of grindings reported this week. Yesterday the US
fourth-quarter grind was announced up 15.3 per cent on the previous fourth
quarter at 84,962 tonnes. Earlier in the week the UK fourth-quarter grind
was reported 18.7 per cent ahead, while the German grind, which was expected
to show a slight fall, was up a surprising 17.7 per cent.
Yesterday May cocoa closed unchanged at Pounds 728, up Pounds 25 on the
week, as the market consolidated its gains.
However, robusta coffee yesterday lost most of the gains made earlier in the
week, depressed by a sharp fall in early New York trading.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours comes under strong attack from
Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD yesterday attacked the hostile bid launched by its rival tour
operator Airtours, saying it had taken advantage of a profits fall that
followed one mistake over holiday pricing at the end of 1991.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, said shareholders should not
under-play the commercial benefit of its proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook,
the travel agency, which was designed to establish a pan-European tour
operator.
He warned that if Airtours succeeded in its hostile Pounds 214.7m bid, it
could create a duopoly in the UK market. Together Airtours and Owners Abroad
would control 33 per cent of the market against the current leader Thomson's
28 per cent, according to market figures from November last year.
Alternatively it could lead to a price war and the kind of wafer-thin
margins seen in the late 1980s. These had resulted in some tour operators
making only 90p profit on a Pounds 230 holiday.
Referring to Airtours' share bid, which is accompanied by a partial cash
alternative, Mr Klein said: 'If you are looking down the barrel of that sort
of thing who is going to want to take paper?'
Airtours' bid, he said, was a defensive move triggered by concern about the
threat from a tie-up between Owners Abroad and Westdeutsche Landesbank, the
German state bank that owns 86 per cent of Thomas Cook and 34 per cent of
LTU, the German charter flights and holidays company.
Airtours had provided no evidence to show it could run a group that would
have Pounds 1.2bn of sales. Nor had it justified claims that it would make
'substantially' greater cost savings in 1994 and 1995 than Owners Abroad has
said it would enjoy from its Thomas Cook deal.
Owners says the savings on that tie-up would be Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m in
the two respective years.
There were also fundamental flaws in Airtours' stated objective of wanting
to expand its Pickfords retail chain which it bought last September.
'The price war has moved from the tour operators to the retail part of the
business,' said Mr Klein. The deal Owners Abroad was proposing would allow
shareholders to enjoy the benefit of greater access to Thomas Cook's retail
outlets and brand name without having to own the chain.
Mr Klein accepted that Owners Abroad had initially set the pricing of its
summer 1992 holidays too high. 'Owners have got it right this year and
Airtours has got it wrong in Florida and Greece,' he said.
Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, denies its Greek pricing is wrong.
The company had cut its Florida prices, after gaining a rebate from Owners
Abroad's Air 2000 charter airline, after Owners had cut its own prices to
levels that had 'amazed the whole industry', he said.
Airtours' shares slipped 1p to 289p yesterday while Owners Abroad fell 2p to
113p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hall shares jump 12p on news of
restructuring deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Hall Engineering (Holdings), hard hit by the depressed
construction and engineering industries, jumped 12p to 131p on the
announcement yesterday of a Pounds 1.5m restructuring programme designed to
reduce overheads and improve profits.
Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, revised its profit forecast from
Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 6.7m for the year to December 31, 1993. It added that
the changes would reduce pre-tax profit to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 5.07m) in
1992, but that the group was likely to maintain its dividend at 1.75p.
The restructuring involves depot closures at the Hall &amp; Pickles steel
stockholding and BRC steel reinforcing products arms. BRC was also forming a
division to include its masonry and cladding business.
The company said the moves would improve profits by about Pounds 1.2m a
year, but involved the loss of 90 jobs. Hall's workforce had fallen from
1,600 a year ago to about 1,400.
The latest changes - Hall sold BRC's South African business in September and
closed its Stafford factory in June 1991 - was brought on by the collapse in
demand for steel reinforcing from the construction industry, and flat demand
for its engineering products.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Holders shun Lonrho rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S rights issue was shunned by most of its shareholders. The offer
closed yesterday afternoon.
Shares in the international trading group rose 1p to 72p compared with the
rights issue price of 85p.
Although Lonrho will not announce the results of the issue until Monday, its
advisers confirmed that there had been very little take-up by shareholders.
The structure was designed to allow Mr Dieter Bock, a German financier who
is underwriting half the 200m new shares, to become Lonrho's biggest
shareholder. Mr Bock's stake in the enlarged group is expected to be close
to 18.8 percent.
Charterhouse, which is acting for Lonrho, said it had been important to
offer all the group's shareholders the same terms as Mr Bock, regardless of
the expected take-up.
Other parties have until Tuesday afternoon to bid for the rights rump, which
otherwise lapses. However, while there have been several expressions of
interest, there have been no firm offers.
The German financier will consider whether to join the board next month. If
he does take up a directorship it is expected to be as joint chief executive
with Mr Tiny Rowland.
Many of Lonrho's shareholders, who have been deeply concerned about the
unresolved question of the succession, believe Mr Bock will succeed the
75-year-old Mr Rowland.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said: 'Mr Rowland has no present
intention of retiring for at least three years.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring cuts OMI's loss to Pounds
88,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMI International, the industrial logistics, diagnostics and optronics
group, came close to break-even in the six months to September 30 as it
began to feel the benefits of two years of restructuring, writes Matthew
Curtin.
Pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 1.34m to Pounds 88,000. There was a
return to operating profits with Pounds 8,000, compared with losses of
Pounds 103,000 on turnover of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 26.3m). Interest payable
was Pounds 96,000, against Pounds 205,000 received.
Mr Gil Williams, chairman, said the results were as expected, adding that a
recent report forecasting Pounds 400,000 pre-tax profits was not based on
information released by the company or its brokers. The shares fell from 27
1/2 p to 22p
In August, the group sold its profitable technical recruitment agency and
loss-making aerospace design subsidiary, which, Mr Williams said, had been a
serious drain on cashflow. Average borrowings of Pounds 2m were cut to
Pounds 500,000 by September 30.
Electro-Optics, the manufacturing subsidiary, increased sales by 10 per cent
and improved profits. Instrumentation sales were weaker and the services
division operated in a difficult market.
Losses per share improved from 3p to 0.2p and the interim dividend is held
at 0.75p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tie Rack forecasts sharp advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Tie Rack, the tie and fashion accessories retailer, rose
11p to 83p yesterday after the company said its annual profits would be
significantly ahead of market expectations.
Stronger sales in the run-up to Christmas meant that total turnover for the
year to January 31 was likely to be 20 per cent up on last year's Pounds
54.6m.
Tie Rack said pre-tax profits for the year would easily exceed the Pounds
2.5m to Pounds 3.5m range forecast by sector analysts last September, when
it announced interim profits of Pounds 301,000.
Sales growth in December, accounting for up to a quarter of annual turnover,
was 2.5 per cent ahead of 1991 figures.
However, Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, sounded a note of caution,
warning: 'The economic climate is uncertain and consumer confidence is still
low'.
Ms Joan D'Olier, at County NatWest, who in September forecast a Pounds 2.9m
profit, said she now expected Pounds 4.3m, while Mr Michael Holmes, at BZW -
Tie Rack's broker - predicted Pounds 4.5m. Both anticipated earnings per
share of at least 5p with a 1p dividend.
The forecasts compare with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.03m last year, when
earnings per share were 1.99p and the dividend 0.5p.
Further improvements in trading performance, however, have been undermined
by losses in the company's US operation and slowing sales at its French
outlets. Franchises in Norway and The Republic of Ireland had also been
disappointing, Mr McGinley said.
Mr Holmes added: 'They are trying to reduce losses in the US, where they are
running non-profitable shops on five-year leases.'
The company could also be hit by larger than expected tax charges, according
to Ms D'Olier. Earnings in high tax countries and on UK capital investments,
which were ineligible for tax relief, could leave it facing a tax rate of
more than 39 per cent.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Prudential new UK business up 13% - Shares
advance as market welcomes better-than-expected figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the life assurance group, reported a 13.3 per cent
increase in UK new business last year. New business outside the UK, partly
boosted by currency movements was up by 11.7 per cent, although most of this
was accounted for by the sterling's devaluation.
The market welcomed the figures, which were better than expected, and the
shares closed at 296p, up 9p on the day.
Single premium products performed far more strongly than regular premiums,
which were damaged by low consumer confidence. Total UK single premium
business increased from Pounds 1.41bn to Pounds 1.97bn, while annual
premiums failed to keep up with inflation, rising from Pounds 320m to Pounds
325m.
Mr Peter Nowell, group chief actuary, attributed the single premium rise to
increased pension transfer business, caused by people moving jobs or taking
early retirement.
Annual life premiums fell from Pounds 136m to Pounds 126m, but life single
premiums more than doubled to Pounds 846m. This was almost entirely due to
sales of the Prudence Bond, the Prudential's single-premium with-profits
bond, which took in Pounds 835m.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, an analyst at Smith New Court, said that both pension
transfers and the Prudence Bond should be more profitable than most single
premium products, as it was difficult for customers to surrender the
policies. The company's right to make a market value adjustment on pay-outs
from the Prudence Bond meant that it should not impose a great capital
strain, he said. Scottish Mutual, the life assurance company wholly owned by
Abbey National saw total new business of Pounds 179.4m for 1992, up 29 per
cent from 1991's Pounds 139.4m.
Total single premiums rose 41 per cent to Pounds 158.1m, while regular
premiums fell 21 per cent to Pounds 21.2m. This was a sharper drop than that
experienced by the few companies which have so far reported, but Mr Cizdyn
said he believed it would prove to be in line with the industry trend.
United Friendly, the life assurance group, announced an increase in annual
premium business from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 25.9m. This change, starkly
against the industry trend, was attributed to sharply increased agency
sales.
The company may also have benefited from switches from other companies,
following the decision of some rivals to raise their minimum premiums.
Single premium business, again helped by pension transfers, more than
doubled from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 41.9m.
The shares rose 9p to close at 513p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: FNFC trims loss and seeks Pounds 46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, yesterday
announced a rights offering of Pounds 45.8m in order to rebuild its weakened
capital base.
The group also disclosed a pre-tax loss for the year to end-October of
Pounds 31.8m, reducing the previous year's deficit of Pounds 33.7m. It again
passed its final dividend.
The issue of 47.6m convertible preference shares, at Pounds 1 each, will
ensure that the company complies with the new minimum EC capital adequacy
requirement for bank holding companies of 8 per cent capital to assets. It
had been feared it would fall below this ratio in June, when it must repay
Pounds 12m of loan stock. Up to Pounds 5m of the issue could also be used to
strengthen its loss-making commercial finance arm.
FNFC said it would declare a dividend of 0.5p at the 1993 half year and a
further 1p at the full year, if the issue was approved by shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting on February 8.
The group disclosed a strong improvement in its consumer credit subsidiary
First National Bank for the second half. It made a full-year loss of Pounds
4.6m (Pounds 20.1m) in the year after a second half profit of Pounds 8.2m.
The commercial lending arm, First National Commercial Bank, performed badly
because of a higher provision of Pounds 10m for bad loans in the second
half. It made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.4m in the second half, taking the
full-year loss to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 8m).
The group made a loss of Pounds 54.2m after tax and extraordinary items. The
extraordinary loss of Pounds 25.1m included a Pounds 3.1m write down in the
value of the company's premises and a Pounds 2.3m loss on the disposal of
its leisure activities.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said the outlook for the group was 'much
improved' after two years of heavy losses. The consumer credit operation was
being made increasingly profitable by falls in interest rates.
The group was very sensitive to interest rate movements because it was
financed principally by bank debt, and because minimum lending rates applied
to consumer loans such as mortgages and advances for home improvements.
When the one month London Interbank Offered Rate averaged 10.8 per cent in
December last year, the net interest income on consumer credit balances was
Pounds 7.8m. When it was 7.2 per cent last month, net interest income was
Pounds 9.7m.
Analysts said the consumer credit business, which made loss-making loans in
the late 1980s when the company faced heavy competition, was likely to
continue its recovery as improved credit scoring started to take effect.
The issue, on the basis of two convertibles for every seven ordinary shares
and one for every 6.72 existing convertibles, was prompted by an erosion of
the group's capital base from Pounds 217m of shareholders funds in October
1990 to Pounds 135m at October 1992.
The preference shares, which have a 7 per cent net yield, will be
convertible into ordinary shares at a price of 63p from May 15 this year
until May 2008. They would comprise 30.4 per cent of the group's fully
diluted ordinary share capital.
FNFC's shares rose from 56.5p to 71p on the announcement, and closed at 68p.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Borrie to join MGN board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence that Mirror Group Newspapers plans to stick to its
traditional political stance came yesterday with the appointment of Sir
Gordon Borrie as a non-executive director.
Sir Gordon, until last year director general of fair trading, said that he
was interested in the political aspect of the newspaper group.
'I would like to see the Mirror keep left of centre in the range of its
political views,' said Sir Gordon, who was approached by Lord Hollick, the
Labour peer, about the directorship.
Sir Gordon Borrie, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate, gave up
membership of the party when he became director general at the Office of
Fair Trading in 1976.
He rejoined the Labour Party last June, soon after retiring from his OFT job
and before Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, asked him to chair the
Commission on Social Justice.
The Commission is meant to update the work of the Beveridge report, which
provided the blueprint for the welfare state.
Sir Gordon said he looked forward to working with the MGN directors 'to
ensure that the company's undoubted strengths and talents are fully utilised
in meeting its obligations to its employees, readers and shareholders.'
Sir Gordon is going to read the Daily Mirror regularly again after a lapse
of some years.

In what was probably the most difficult year for the international

Mr Christo Philipson, chairman of the USM-quoted company, said that the

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Zetters slips 5% to Pounds 427,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Zetters Group, the football pools operator, returned pre-tax profits of
Pounds 427,000 for the half year ended September 30, a downturn of 5 per
cent on last time's Pounds 451,000.
Pools turnover dipped by just 1.5 per cent to Pounds 10.63m (Pounds 10.8m)
while that of competitions and marketing fell to Pounds 88,000 (Pounds
232,000).
The interim dividend is a same-again 4p and is being paid from earnings of
4p (4.1p).
Profitability of the spot the ball competition, which is run in partnership
with Littlewoods and Vernons pools, was 'very satisfactory' but the
telephone-related and other services did not meet expectations.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ryan Hotels falls into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in interest charges and exceptional costs left Ryan Hotels with a
pre-tax deficit of IPounds 186,163 (Pounds 196,457) for the 12 months to
October.
That compared with a profit of IPounds 975,085 last time and came from
turnover up by IPounds 1.65m to IPounds 21m. Losses per share were 0.59p
(earnings 1.11p), or 0.42p (earnings 1.48p) on a nil basis.
Mr Conor McCarthy, chairman, said additional borrowings to fund capital
expenditure had led to an increase in interest payable from IPounds 1.72m to
IPounds 2.57m. A rise in exceptional costs, from IPounds 82,000 to IPounds
415,462, was the result of a series of cost-cutting programmes, he added.
Mr McCarthy also announced that, to achieve a more equal distribution of the
trading results for the two halves of the year, the Dublin-based group was
changing to a January year end.
To achieve this change, Ryan Hotels would be reporting on a 15-month period
from November 1991 to January 1993. At this stage the question of a final
dividend would be considered, the chairman said. A final of 0.5p was paid
last time.

arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS to Lilley, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group
which collapsed last week, said yesterday that offers had been received for
the majority of its contracting businesses.
Mr Iain Bennet, of Price Waterhouse, said: 'Even where offers have not been
made for the entire business, bids have been submitted for the major
contracts so that following successful sales of these contracts, value will
be obtained and there is a realistic pros-pect of jobs being secured while
these contracts are completed.'
Mr Bennet said it was too early to announce the details of completed sales
because negotiations were continuing over the weekend. It was hoped that the
sales would be completed early next week.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons severs a Seagram trading link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED-LYONS is to end the present contracts under which Seagram markets and
distributes the UK group's Ballantine's Scotch whisky and other brands in
France and Germany.
Seagram, which has handled the brands in France since 1964 and in Germany
since 1988, has been given notice that the arrangements will be terminated
on December 31.
However, talks are continuing between the groups about future distribution
of the drinks, which include Courvoisier cognac, Kahlua and Tia Maria.
Seagram said yesterday that loss of the contracts would have a relatively
small financial impact but the North American group, which built
Ballantine's into the best-selling Scotch in France, would clearly like to
retain the agency business.
It distributes some Allied brands in Korea and a few smaller Far East
markets.
In the meantime, it said that arrangements had been made to ensure
continuity of supply of Allied's products and it would focus its efforts on
a portfolio of its own and agency brands, including Jack Daniels and Jim
Beam bourbons, and Southern Comfort.
Allied said that it was still considering a number of options for
distribution in France and Germany and no decision had yet been taken.
The move reflects the general trend among international spirits groups to
secure direct control of their brands distribution.

FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National raises Pounds 150m in bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National yesterday raised Pounds 150m in the bond market as part of a
move to further boost its capital for regulatory purposes.
At 10.5 per cent, Abbey's overall ratio of capital to assets is already
comfortably ahead of most other UK banks. However, the bank said it wanted
to raise new capital while it could borrow at favourable rates, rather than
risking waiting until it needed the capital.
The Pounds 150m of subordinated debt, which is structured to be repaid in
2018, comes at a time when long-term borrowing in the sterling market is
scarce. With the gap between short- and long-term interest rates widening,
most companies have shifted towards shorter-term borrowings.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Grow, grow, grow your boat: The rise of size in the
international cruise market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Dickinson, marketing director at Miami's Carnival Cruise Lines, recently
made a promotional video. To demonstrate on-board facilities, Carnival
filmed an employee strolling through a cruise liner's atrium - it was seven
storeys high.
The story illustrates the extent to which size dominates today's cruise-line
industry. Carnival vessels, with names like Fantasy and Ecstasy, are
essentially giant floating hotels, capable of housing 2,000 or more
passengers. The surrounding ocean is almost incidental.
Only this week, Carnival - the world's largest cruise-line operator in terms
of passengers carried - ordered a 95,000-ton ship from an Italian yard, at a
cost of more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m). The vessel, which could be in
service within four years, will have 1,300 berths and sleep up to 4,400
people. In terms of gross tonnage, it will be 25 per cent bigger than any
cruise ship ploughing the seas at present (the QE2, by comparison, is 67,000
tons).
But it is not just the ships that are changing. The notion that cruises are
genteel holidays for the wealthy, full of Cowardesque figures sipping dry
Martinis, has been interred. Today's cruise-line customer is more likely to
be under 50, with an annual income of less than Dollars 50,000. He or she is
probably a sun-seeker, headed for the Caribbean, who will spend fewer than
seven days on board.
At first glance, these changes seem to have enabled the cruise-line business
to navigate the recession in better shape than most of the leisure industry.
Since the 1990s began, airlines and hotels have faced shrinking demand and
severe financ-ial pressures.
In North America, easily the largest cruise market in the world, the New
York-based Cruise Lines International Association estimates that 4.4m people
took cruises last year. That was an increase on 1991 of 10 per cent - which
is also the average annual growth rate registered over the past decade.
Occupancy rates for North American cruise operators averaged 85-90 per cent
last year; US airlines struggle to achieve figures in the high 60s.
But beneath the surface, prospects are murkier. While demand increased,
about one dozen new ships also came into operation in 1992, adding about
11,000 berths and increasing total capacity by about 12.5 per cent. This
year, another five liners - including Carnival's giant Sensation, which is
more than 850 feet long and capable of carrying 2,600 passengers - will also
hit the high seas.
The industry's optimists, like Mr Dickinson, think that demand will grow to
match the capacity expansion. They point out that, even in recessionary
times, cruise holidays have appeal. The cost of such holidays is fixed at
the outset, because the fare includes meals and entertainment. By adding in
all the extra expenses attached to a conventional, land-based vacation, it
may be cheaper to buy a cruise-line package than to stay at a hotel.
Others in the travel industry are less sanguine. Travel agents, for example,
note that heavy discounting of published cruise-line fares has been
prevalent for several years and shows no signs of letting up. 'Published
prices mean absolutely nothing,' says one Manhattan-based travel agent.
'Every time you turn around, someone's bringing on a new ship - there's so
much overcapacity at present.' High occupancy rates are achieved only
through discounting: current offers, he says, include 'two tickets for the
price of one' and cuts of 30 or 40 per cent off brochure prices.
While it is true that Carnival has posted steady annual profit advances,
half a dozen smaller companies are believed to have faced serious financial
problems. A handful of companies, such as the Seattle-based Exploration
Cruise Lines, have filed for bankruptcy protection.
Nevertheless, Cruise-ship owners claim that their 'untapped' market is huge.
CLIA, for example, cites market research showing that 60 per cent of North
American adults 'dream of taking a cruise', while only between 5 and 7 per
cent of the population has done so.
The non-American market also presents a large potential source of new
customers. In the UK, the world's second biggest market, the Passenger
Shipping Association estimates that about 200,000 people went on cruises
last year. A flight to Florida, followed by a Caribbean cruise, was the most
popular option.
While the number of UK residents taking cruises has more than doubled since
the mid-1980s, it is still tiny compared with the 11m who take air-based
package holidays abroad. In Germany, the next biggest market, the PSA
estimates the number of cruise passengers is only about 175,000.
Although cruises are attracting younger UK customers, the industry concedes
it still has work to do. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing director of Lunn
Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent chain, says: 'The UK is a potentially
lucrative market, but historically the British have seen cruising as a
holiday for the blue-rinse brigade.' He argues that is changing. Although
recent UK-wide Lunn Poly presentations on cruising failed to attract people
in their 20s, potential customers in their 30s did turn up.
Bigger ships are central to the industry's attempt to extend the appeal of
cruising. Operationallly, large ships offer some basic economies of scale.
Senior crew numbers, for example, do not increase proportionately with a
ship's size. Nor do promotional expenses.
But the main advantage comes on the marketing front. Many people still think
of a cruise as too stuffy, Dickinson admits. 'They expect a string quartet
at four o'clock and a lecture on geranium-planting in the evening.' The new
jumbo ships quickly dispel this impression.
They are marketed as 'fun ships', with casinos, spas, jogging tracks, even
golf facilities. Cruise companies allow passengers to keep up with their
favourite sports events. Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Viking introduced
big-screen showings of sports events last autumn, covering top league
baseball and basketball games.
In answer to suggestions that travellers could grow weary of being confined
in the company of several thousand other holidaymakers, Dickinson says
defensively: 'There are hotels with 2,000 rooms in Vegas.'
The Cassandras are not convinced. Gerald Celente, director of the Trends
Research Institute in New York state, sees similarities with the US hotel
industry, which overbuilt in the 1980s now lives with the burdens of
oversupply.
Does he not buy the argument that demand is just waiting to be tapped? 'The
huge potential market,' he says, 'has to have the money to spend. Look at
the recent Christmas shopping . . . those people are simply going into debt
again. They just don't have the discretionary income.' If he is right,
cruise companies could find themselves becalmed.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Europe's case of the Danish blues: The implications of Poul
Schluter's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country with only 5m people, lying in Germany's shadow on the northern
periphery of Europe, Denmark has acquired an uncanny knack for holding the
EC's future in its hands.
The resignation of Mr Poul Schluter, conservative prime minister since 1982,
has confounded hopes of a period of relative political calm inside the
European Community. His fall as a result of an obscure scandal involving the
treatment of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka has injected fresh uncertainty
over the development of the EC.
The impact should not be exaggerated, since Mr Schluter headed a shaky
minority government and Denmark's EC policy has always been the product of
bargaining between the principal parties in the Folketing, the powerful
Danish parliament.
But Mr Schluter's resignation blurs what just four weeks ago appeared to be
a clear road map for the Community. Last month at the Edinburgh summit EC
leaders agreed to spell out legally binding Danish opt-outs on the
Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union, paving the way
for a second referendum to be held around April 27.
The new year passed, Denmark took over the EC presidency, and national polls
showed Danish voters overwhelmingly in favour of the treaty. With a Danish
Yes in the offing, prospects improved for quick parliamentary ratification
by the UK and the implementation of the treaty by late autumn.
The odds still appear to favour approval of Maastricht. True, no one inside
or outside Denmark is quite sure how the extended text differs in substance
from the treaty rejected narrowly in last June's referendum. But seven out
of Denmark's eight political parties back the Edinburgh deal which sets out
exemptions on monetary union, a common defence policy, EC justice and home
affairs and common citizenship.
More important, the main parties, notably the opposition Social Democrats,
have pledged to campaign wholeheartedly for Maastricht. Last year they were
content to let Danish business and the civil service defend what many Danes
thought was an unsatisfactory treaty.
In June, almost 60 per cent of Social Democrat supporters failed to back the
treaty, either because of a lack of enthusiasm or hostility towards Mr
Schluter's conservative-liberal coalition. If the Social Democrats form the
next government, they would be likely to push Maastricht hard, recognising
that the next referendum is Denmark's last chance to come back into the EC
fold.
Or so the argument in Copenhagen goes. But as the events of the past few
months demonstrate, nothing in Denmark is quite what it first seems. The
country meets the exacting standards required for European monetary union on
inflation and budget deficits but appears unwilling to take part in a single
European currency. It vigorously supports the single European market but has
serious reservations about common European citizenship. Danes can be dour
(listen to Mr H O A Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council talking
about improvements in Denmark's pig slaughtering capacity); or they can be
frivolous. The economic minister created a diplomatic incident recently when
he joked about dispatching the Danish navy unless neighbouring Sweden shut
down a nuclear power station near Copenhagen.
The 'Tamilgate' scandal contains similar contradictions. Mr Schluter, 63,
was not directly involved in the affair which began in 1987 when Mr Erik
Ninn-Hansen, then justice minister, ordered civil servants to delay entry
visas for the wives, children and relatives of Tamil refugees.
The Tamils had an explicit right under Denmark's liberal immigration law to
bring their families into the country. But Mr Ninn-Hansen, judging that the
prospects for peace in Sri Lanka were improving and that the Tamil refugee
flow might ease, decided to delay consideration of the cases. The affair
only became serious when it emerged that efforts had been made to prevent
the parliamentary ombudsman investigating the affair. Mr Schluter sealed his
fate when he declared to parliament in 1989 that 'nothing has been swept
under the carpet'.
Mr Mogens Hornslet, the High Court judge appointed by Mr Schluter to uncover
the truth, last Thursday delivered a verdict so damning that the prime
minister had no option but to resign. Having misled parliament so clearly,
few believe that Mr Schluter can come back, though he might stay on as a
caretaker until a new prime minister is found.
Danish officials this week were unsure whether to display pride in the open
nature of Danish government or dismay that it had cost their country one of
the its most experience leaders since the second world war.
One foreign ministry diplomat recalled Mr Schluter entering office in
September 1982, ending the Social Democrats' 50-year domination of Danish
politics. 'Nobody gave him six months,' he said.
In the event, Mr Schluter proved to be one of Europe's great survivors, a
conciliator who presided over a period of political stability and rising
prosperity as Denmark recovered from its huge budget and foreign debt
burdens. On the bright side, the Tamilgate affair is a working model of
Danish arguments in favour of more transparency in European Community
decision-making and more accountability. Not many other countries would be
prepared to sacrifice a prime minister to defend the rights of Tamil
immigrants, one EC official said.
But the same official acknowledged that it was far from clear whether the
majority of Danes viewed Tamilgate in the same light. Indeed, one
interpretation is that the scandal is more a product of Denmark's tortured
liberal political culture.
For despite its liberal immigration laws, most Danes are wary of immigrants.
This week a poll showed 70 per cent in favour of tighter immigration laws.
Mr Helvig Petersen, a former leader of the Radical Liberal party who
supports the country's liberal immigration policy, fears that a
post-Tamilgate election campaign could lead to an ugly debate about the
numbers of Turks, Pakistanis, Yugoslavs - and Tamils. 'We are a very
homogeneous population,' says Mr Petersen, 'we are not used to black people
coming in and we have experienced more difficulties than we would have
liked.'
As party leaders in Denmark struggled to resolve the political crisis
yesterday, Mr Ivar Norgaard, chairman of the Folketing's market committee
which oversees the EC, stressed the continuity in Danish EC policy and
played down the potential damage to his country's presidency.
The priorities were already set, he said. Enlargement talks with Sweden,
Austria, Finland and Norway are to start next month; all Danes are looking
forward to being joined by their Scandinavian neighbours who will, they
believe, redress the southern tilt caused by the accession of Greece,
Portugal and Spain. Moreover, all parties emphasise the need for EC
decision-making to be more transparent and to be devolved to the lowest
level.
If the Social Democrat opposition, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, forms the
next government, some change is certain. Initiatives to promote employment
and to strengthen the environment will be given priority; free marketeers
such as Mrs Anne Birgitte Lundholt, industry minister, will doubtless go;
and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, will gain new
allies in Copenhagen.
On Wednesday morning, Mr Delors met Mr Schluter and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
the effervescent Danish foreign minister, to discuss the Danish presidency's
plans for the next six months.
Once again Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who predicted confidently that Maastricht
would be approved last year, showed a fatal attraction for forecasting.
Asked about Tamilgate, he asked what the fuss was about.
'I have every confidence that next week and next month the prime minister
will still be Poul Schluter and yours truly (as foreign minister).' His EC
colleagues will be hoping that Mr Ellemann-Jensen's confidence in the future
of the Community will prove more reliable.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Tougher business entry regulation would give
stability and strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN HEENAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government and other optimists often quote the number of new
company registrations as a sign of growth and regeneration of industry. This
ignores the fact that very many of these are 'phoenix' companies, set up to
acquire the assets (but not liabilities) of bust businesses, often owned by
the same people who owned the previous business. There is evidence that this
process is sometimes a deliberate 'financial cleansing': I am sure we have
all seen it.
Anyone with even 'O' level economics will know that a reasonable level of
profits can only be maintained in any industry if there are barriers to
entry sufficient to keep irresponsible traders out. UK company and
insolvency law does nothing to help in this respect, and while it continues
to allow the recycling of assets in fragmented and over competitive
industries, it will delay the recovery of profits and the return of investor
confidence.
I suggest that stricter criteria are needed for those starting in business
and who wish to enjoy limited liability, than the Pounds 50 or so it takes
to buy an off-the-shelf company. In the long run, effective measures would
lead to greater stability and industrial strength in many sectors. Duncan

FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: A wilder swing, and luckily up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY WALSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the article 'Serious Money' (January 9) a way of beating the Dow
developed by a US fund manager, Michael O'Higgins, was described. This
involved picking the five stocks with the highest yields and lowest share
prices from the Dow's 30 constituents and was reported as having produced
annual returns (1973-1991) of 19.4 per cent versus 10.4 per cent from the
Dow Jones.
When applied to the FT-30 Index for the period 1979-1992 it showed returns
of 22 per cent vs 17.5 per cent from the All Share.
Of course the explanation is that with a portfolio of only five stocks the
amount of diversifiable risk is still significant, ie the higher returns are
effectively the reward for higher risk, and the combined returns of the
stocks will swing more wildly than that of the larger basket of the full Dow
Jones or the All Share index.
Luckily they swung upwards so that Michael O'Higgins could write his book
and Philip Coggan could write his article]

FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Glad to leave darkest Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALFRED P MASONDO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the article 'Africa: Frustrating but worthwhile'
by 'practical traveller' Nicholas Woodsworth (January 9). As he found so
many 'frustrations' travelling on the so-called 'dark continent', I would be
very interested in knowing if it is indeed worthwhile for British tourists
to travel in Africa.
Bearing in mind the many frustrations I have faced since I came to Britain,
I will fortunately be leaving soon. I think the first thing I will do when I
do return home to the 'dark continent' is write an article entitled:

FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: Iraqi instability no surprise if its coastline
confiscated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr RICHARD LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many of Iraq's troubles stem from map-drawing at the end of the first
world war. Saddam, more than any other of Iraq's rulers, has failed to come
to grips with them. Much of the cartography was unfair. Worst of all was the
Shatt al Arab boundary, which penalised the country which has almost no
access to the sea while rewarding Iran, blessed with a more than ample
coastline. This short-sighted arrangement was one of the chief causes of the
Iraqi war with Iran in the 1980s.
It has been disheartening to learn that a similar mistake has been made  -
apparently secretly - in recent days. You rightly hinted at it in your
editorial ('Gulf war revisited', January 14) by speaking of the Umm Qasr
port area as land which 'the United Nations now recognises as Kuwaiti
territory'. It did not do so two days ago. Until then, it belonged to Iraq,
as it had since the country made its first appearance as a state in modern
times. Now the UN has given away a piece of Iraq.
I visited Umm Qasr port in the 1960s, when no one doubted that it was a
possession, indeed a proud new creation, of Iraq. To cut it off from its
hinterland seems clumsy. To confiscate part of the minuscule coastline of a
country which went to war two years ago partly for the lack of an adequate
one is gratuitously to sow seeds of future instability where there are quite
enough already. To leave the new border unprotected has been to invite
(entrap?) the Iraqis into crossing it to retrieve their equipment. Is it any
wonder that they have so lost control of themselves in recent days as to
provoke the allies into again bombing their long-suffering country. Richard

FT  16 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC licence fee is no more than flat-rate,
inequitable tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN MCCARTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It seems to me that the proper use of licence systems is to regulate
and tax minority pursuits. The BBC 'licence fee' is in reality a flat-rate
tax of Pounds 80 on all householders regardless of circumstance and, as
such, seems unique. Taxpayers are not asked to pay a flat-rate tax to
support the armed forces or the health service, why should the BBC be
different? In using the words 'rough justice', David Robertson (Letters,
January 13) clearly has some feel for the basic inequity in the system, but
I suspect he has no concept of what a huge (hugely unfair?) sum Pounds 80
represents to low-income people, who might be totally dependent on
television as their sole source of entertainment.
The system, far from offering justice in any form, seems to me to be almost
immoral. The time for change is long overdue and there seem to be two very
reasonable alternatives.
First, direct grant from government. Apart from the fairness that would
ensue, think of the savings to be made in the costs of collecting and
administering the licence system.
Second, advertising (although I suspect the commercial television companies
would regard a new powerful competitor as 'rough' if not 'justice'). Why
shouldn't the BBC be subject to normal commercial pressures and financial
discipline? The usual response to such suggestions is hysteria about adverse
effects on so-called programme quality. But is Coronation Street worse than
Eldorado?

FT  16 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Clinton's viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK from now Mr Bill Clinton will be president of the US. Whether his
elevation represents the decisive break with the free-market economics of
his two predecessors is, as yet, far from clear. What is clear, however, is
the change he represents in attitudes to government itself. Unlike Mr Reagan
or Mr Bush, Mr Clinton believes in it passionately. What is more, as a
Democrat facing a Democratic Congress, he has the capacity to act on that
belief. Yet to govern is to choose. Mr Clinton will have to make his choices
soon.
The new president wants to achieve the economic regeneration of the US. Yet
Mr Michael Boskin, outgoing chairman of the council of economic advisers,
argues in his annual Economic Report of the President that the US is not in
economic decline relative to most other advanced industrial countries. He is
right. Of industrial countries, only Japan's overall economic performance
has been notably better over the long term.
Mr Boskin is not a pseudonym for Dr Pangloss. He admits the 'deplorable'
quality of secondary education, an excessively costly healthcare system that
fails to insure many Americans, and continuing high levels of poverty. It is
to Mr Clinton's credit that these are the main items on his agenda.
Unfortunately for him, some of these problems - the poor quality of
secondary education, for example - may be beyond the power of even the most
determined president to remedy. Meanwhile, those that might be remediable -
incomplete health insurance, for example - are likely to add a huge burden
to a budget already drowning in red ink. The more Mr Clinton chooses to
increase public spending, the less he will be able to reduce the yawning
fiscal deficit. That is no trivial matter, however, since the fiscal deficit
is the single most important remediable cause for the low US rate of capital
accumulation.
Strongest economy
To make the new administration's dilemma worse, Mr Richard Darman, the
outgoing budget director, admitted last week that the US fiscal deficit was
more likely to widen than narrow, on unchanged policies. In view of Mr
Clinton's ambitions for public spending, his promise to cut the budget
deficit in half in his first term is likely to suffer the same fate as
similar promises from his predecessor.
Fortunately for the new president, what he inherits is not in all respects
as unhealthy as the fiscal arithmetic. The US economy is virtually certain
to be the strongest in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries this
year. A relatively strong US economy, combined with dismal performance
almost everywhere else, is the opposite of what the hapless Mr Nicholas
Brady had to face throughout his term of office. It will help give Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, Mr Clinton's nominee as US Treasury secretary, the platform from
which to 'reassert leadership in the G7', as he desires.
Mr Bentsen may even find himself pushing, if not on an open door - the
Bundesbank's never is, where expansionary policies are concerned, at least
on one that is not locked and bolted. It is encouraging, moreover, that so
senior a figure in the forthcoming administration recognises the importance
of active international engagement. Mr Clinton's domestic agenda was, it
once seemed, likely to crowd out international concerns. Perhaps that danger
has been overstated.
Religious attachment
The fundamental question is not whether the US should be engaged, but how.
What, in particular, should it try to do in the G7?
It must not repeat past experiments with exchange rate co-ordination. The
monetary effects of those attempts were probably the most important single
cause of Japan's bubble economy and its aftermath, which also explains the
Bank of Japan's unwillingness to pursue expansionary monetary policies
today. There is little more chance of achieving exchange rate co-ordination
with the principal European economies. Given the almost religious attachment
to fixed exchange rates of so many of them, this may be surprising. The
exception, however, is Germany and it alone is in a position to bind the
European currencies to the US dollar and the Japanese yen.
Nevertheless, economic pressures ensure that Germany will move still further
towards expansionary policies. The Bundesbank may well move fast enough to
save what is left of the ERM. Even so, the Bundesbank's movement remains too
slow for the German government.
This continued inability of the German government to co-ordinate with the
German central bank makes talk of international co-ordination seem rather
ambitious. But some things must be attempted. Two items, in particular,
should be on the top of the agenda: greater help for reform in the former
Soviet Union and completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Mr Clinton cannot escape these responsibilities. There can be
no purely domestic US presidency and no lasting domestic success without an
effective international engagement.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Man In The News: Just what the doctor ordered - Adovan
Karadzic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, reviled throughout the
world for their policy of 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia, at last appears to
have been outmanoeuvred. Against his own most fundamental convictions, and
certainly those of his hardline colleagues, he will be forced next week to
defend before his own parliament a constitutional agreement for Bosnia
imposed on him by his closest ally, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president.
The shock-headed psychiatrist, whose specialities are neurosis and
depression, may also be fighting for his political life. If the Bosnian Serb
assembly, composed largely of the kind of extremists which make Mr Karadzic
look moderate, reject the plan proposed by the international mediators in
Geneva, he has threatened to resign. Given the general unreliability of his
promises, it is perhaps more likely that he might be jettisoned by Serb
military leaders, unwilling to give up the substantial territorial gains
they have made at the Moslems' expense.
It is a matter of supreme irony that Dr Karadzic should have been put in
such a difficult position by the man who personifies his ideals of Serbian
nationalism and a greater Serbia. To the surprise of most observers, with
the exception perhaps of the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, who
had meticulously prepared such a scenario, Mr Milosevic exerted
extraordinary pressure to make the Bosnian Serb leader change his mind.
'They really did twist Karadzic's arm unmercifully,' a seasoned diplomatic
observer said afterwards. Indeed, the normally loquacious Mr Karadzic was
reported to have been reduced to virtual incoherence at the end of the talks
early this week, when he saw the prospect of a Serbian 'state within a
state' evaporate - at least on paper.
Like many psychiatrists, the man whom Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the outgoing
US secretary of state, said should be one of those to be tried for war
crimes, has something of a split personality - a Jekyll and Hyde. Though,
physically, an intimidatingly large bear-like figure, many of his visitors
have been seduced by his personal charm. He has written, published and likes
to talk about poetry - he did so last year on a BBC arts programme - and,
incongruous though it might seem, he plays the Serbian lyre. He is a family
man. His wife Lilyan is also a psychiatrist and his two children, both in
their 20s, also study medicine. At one stage, Dr Karadzic was even the
official doctor to the Sarajevo football team.
Those acquainted with the Bosnian Serb leader stress that 'he enjoys the
good life'. He is reputed to have rented a villa for his family in Geneva
for the duration of the peace conference, though he himself tends to stay in
a hotel during the main negotiating sessions. 'He is capable of anything -
good or bad,' in the words of a Yugoslav-born observer. 'He lies
unconsciously in order to please his interlocutors, and he probably
persuades himself that what he says is true.'
The examples of Dr Karadzic's capacity to play havoc with the truth are
manifold. He has, in turn, fiercely denied allegations of ethnic cleansing
and the existence of detention camps into which thousands of Moslems have
been herded, and then promised to open them to inspection and even to close
them. At the same time, the Bosnian Serb propaganda machine, based in Pale,
near Sarajevo, has been disseminating the most horrific stories about
alleged Moslem atrocities, most of which have never been confirmed by
independent sources. At the Geneva negotiations, journalists may report his
statements, but rarely believe them. This week, he made the throw-away
remark as he went into the meeting at which he rejected the Vance-Owen
constitutional proposals: 'I am hoping for a compromise.' A few hours later,
after Mr Milosevic had done his work in a tete-a-tete meeting, he accepted
the proposals - on condition that they were approved by the Bosnian Serb
assembly.
Many believe that the reasons for Dr Karadzic's primitive form of Serbian
nationalism in a region held up, in the past, as an example of successful
ethnic integration, can be found in his origins. He is, in fact, not a Serb.
Born in a mountainous region of Montenegro, he came to Sarajevo to find fame
and fortune, but found it difficult to penetrate the intellectual Moslem
elite. In a country divided into relatively sophisticated Moslem city
dwellers and a rural population dominated by the Serbs, Dr Karadzic, of
peasant origin, found a much greater affinity with the Serbs.
However, he did not emerge into the political limelight until 1990 when,
after a spell in prison for the misappropriation of government funds (Dr
Karadzic claims it was for anti-communist activities), he helped found the
nationalist Serbian Democratic party, with the explicit objective of uniting
all Serbs within a greater Serbia.
The objective has never changed. While the mediators have insisted in the
Geneva negotiations on a unitary, if decentralised Bosnian state, divided
into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, Dr Karadzic has fought tooth and nail for
his vision of a simple ethnic division of the country into three communities
(Serb, Moslem and Croat). In his view they should each be allowed to form 'a
state within a state' with full powers in domestic and international
affairs. Implicit in his proposal is the expectation that the Bosnian Serbs
would merge with Serbia simply when they decided to do so.
Dr Karadzic's great idol, Mr Milosevic, appears temporarily prepared to
abandon this dream, mainly because it is in Serbia's interests to persuade
the international community to lift its sanctions. This has been the biggest
blow suffered by the Bosnian Serb leader in his short political career.
Yet he knows that, unless his own supporters and military leaders completely
abandon him and force him to resign, he can live to fight another day. There
are enough controversial elements of the package which remain to be
negotiated - the map of the provinces into which the country will be divided
and the terms of a cessation of hostilities  - to enable him to spin out the
talks and even to provoke their breakdown. Mr Milosevic willing, of course.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Bugs infest the boardroom: As demand for business
information grows, Michael Cassell examines the extent of UK company
eavesdropping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly before Christmas, a City of London tour guide was interrupted as she
delivered a brief history of the Bank of England over her coach microphone.
Bemused American tourists found themselves listening to a conversation,
relayed through the coach speakers, detailing the proposed negotiating terms
for the acquisition of a chain of 35 shops in France.
The unwitting informant was on his telephone in the car behind. The details
he imparted were of no interest to a group of Texan farm-equipment dealers,
but someone, somewhere, might have gone to extraordinary lengths to get
them.
The thirst for finding out what the commercial competition is up to -
highlighted in this week's High Court revelations over British Airways'
campaign against Virgin Atlantic - appears unquenchable. Given the odds
against a lucky break outside the Bank of England, companies are
increasingly employing sophisticated corporate intelligence skills and
equipment to ensure they are always well briefed.
The business of seeking or safeguarding business secrets is a growth market.
'There has been a big change in attitudes among UK companies towards sizing
up other businesses,' says Mr Terence Burke, a former US Central
Intelligence Agency and Drug Enforcement Agency officer, who heads the
London office of IGI International, a corporate investigation company.
Whereas companies were once primarily intent on protecting the bricks and
mortar of their business against criminals, the value of commercial
information and the potential damage inflicted by its loss is now regarded
as just as important.
Business executives can also argue that they have a fiduciary obligation to
discover, on behalf of shareholders and employees, what competitors are
doing, providing it is legally obtained and does not invade people's
privacy.
IGI has just stopped a UK company signing a lease on an east European office
block with a bogus intermediary. 'That's a case of due diligence, not
spying,' says Mr Burke.
Mr Blenyth Jenkins, director of corporate affairs at the Institute of
Directors, adds: 'Every director of every company has a duty to know as much
as possible about the competition. Even so, there are lengths beyond which
they should not go in trying to find out.'
But how far are companies, or the agencies they hire, prepared to go down
the road to subterfuge and illegality in order to keep an eye on the
competition? Are many of Britain's boardrooms really bugged, or are tales of
widespread industrial espionage as fanciful as the plot of a detective
thriller?
If current sales of electronic surveillance equipment are any guide, then UK
business is overrun with professional busy-bodies, though they are not
necessarily acting illegally: 'To bug your own employees (at work, as Robert
Maxwell did) may not be very nice but it's not going to land you in court,'
says one bugging expert.
Sales of all forms of surveillance equipment, much of it for protective
rather than intrusive purposes, have risen throughout the recession.
Products include 'bugs' concealed in pens, calculators and credit cars. For
the more stylish businessman, there is an electronic olive on a cocktail
stick.
Estimates by larger suppliers suggest that up to 30,000 bugs are sold
annually, with the large majority going to corporate customers.
David Benn, managing director of Lorraine Electronics, says nearly all his
sales are to businessmen. 'There is a lot of corporate paranoia about
information leaking out. One in 50 times something might be found but leaks
are more likely to be the result of sloppiness.'
It is not only companies, but their professional advisers who are apparently
regarded as fair targets for eavesdropping. One of London's largest law
firms has its meeting rooms regularly swept for devices. A senior partner
recalls: 'Information was leaking out almost as soon as our meetings had
ended. Nothing was found but there were clear signs of tampering.'
A merchant bank executive in the City says his offices are also routinely
scanned, part of a 'safety-first' procedure that puts people and documents
into categories of confidentiality: 'Someone with the wrong category of
documents in their possession can be fired.'
To feed the appetite for information on companies, products and individuals,
a new breed of professional corporate investigator is also emerging. Staffed
with former barristers, bankers and accountants, these companies intend to
dismantle the caricature of the slightly seedy detective agency run by
chain-smoking ex-coppers.
If pushed, however, some legitimate agencies concede they might sometimes be
tempted to stretch good business ethics to the limit. None of them say they
would be prepared to mount a campaign to undermine the standing of their
clients' competitors.
BA found to its cost that such a strategy can backfire, reflecting badly on
the company and on everyone involved in it. The affair cost BA Pounds
610,000 in libel damages and an estimated Pounds 3m in legal costs after it
accused Virgin of seeking publicity in exposing a 'dirty tricks' campaign
waged against it.
As with BA, the underbelly of covert corporate detection work is
occasionally exposed. In 1990, as Laing Properties became the target of a
hostile takeover attempt, it told the Takeover Panel it had found an
electronic bug in its offices.
Three years earlier, three men were convicted for placing a listening device
in a biscuit tin outside the home of an executive of Comet, a subsidiary of
the then Woolworth group which was the object of a bid from Dixons.
A more recent story of corporate espionage involves the tactics adopted by a
large UK retailer to undermine another high-street multiple in advance of a
takeover bid. The potential target, its suspicions aroused by unusually bad
figures from some stores, installed listening equipment to eavesdrop on its
managers. A startling tale emerged.
Several managers had been bribed to depress sales returns, denting the
company's figures and making it more vulnerable to outside attack. Damning
conversations were recorded, and the plotters backed off under threat of
exposure.
At present, there are two significant cases of alleged industrial espionage
before the British courts, one involving the alleged sale of confidential
information and the other centred on alleged attempts to plant a 'spy' in a
competing business.
Most companies, however, are more interested in protecting what they hold
than in extracting secrets from others, with some types of business more
sensitive than others to the dangers of damaging leaks.
Increasing numbers of businesses, such as Heinz, the giant food products
group, implement so-called 'risk analysis' exercises, effectively employing
outside professionals to prowl through the company, seeking out weak spots
from which information might escape.
Takeover bids heighten the need for stronger defences on both sides. BTR,
the industrial conglomerate, used corporate investigators to check the
security of its own information systems before bidding successfully in 1991
for Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group. The company was chastened to see
the quality of information abandoned nightly by staff in dustbins.
More generally, tendering activity is seen as an area particularly
vulnerable to information leaks. Knowing what the opposition is prepared to
bid can pay immense dividends.
The oil industry appears more prone than many to information seepage during
the preparation of contract tenders. Other businesses in which security of
information has a high priority include property development, where inside
data can make a big difference to a deal.
In the intensely competitive consumer products business, advance information
on new brands and pricing strategies can pay big bonuses: 'If people think
we just walk round the stores to find out what the others are doing, they
are very wide of the mark,' according to an executive in one personal
products group.
His company, like many others, now operates a competitive intelligence
department, charged with the task of legitimately monitoring the opposition.
Computer manufacturers, too, run units with the same function.
A minefield of legality awaits those tempted to pursue more adventurous
techniques. While anyone can purchase bugging and scanning equipment, the
Interception of Communications Act and the Wireless and Telegraphy Act limit
its use; to adopt a false guise can constitute misrepresentation, while
tapping into computers can invoke the Data Protection Act or the Computer
Misuse Act.
Infringements can be hard to prove. A Manchester property company allegedly
spying on another was charged with stealing 5p of electricity to operate a
bug, although the case was dismissed.
Mr Patrick Grayson, executive managing director of Kroll Associates, the US
corporate investigator, says there is plenty of corporate information
available on the record, provided people know where to look. Mr Grayson,
whose own Savile Row offices are swept for bugs, says his company's
activities follow a code which is based on strict adherence to the law.
'We sometimes have to make moral judgments and, as importantly, there is the
matter of how any actions may be perceived. Dustbin emptying might not
necessarily be illegal but it is certainly tacky. If some clients do not
care how we get information, we do. Our reputation as well as theirs is at
stake.'
Companies like Kroll and IGI, however, have not escaped accusations of
acting in ways that may not fully measure up to their codes of practice.
Mr Bruce George, the Labour MP for Walsall South - who has had his own
Commons offices burgled - is pressing for legislation to ensure that
corporate investigators and other security specialists are licensed. 'Which
other country would tolerate investigators being allowed to operate as free
agents?'
There will always be some readily prepared to indulge in 'dirty tricks',
says Mr Steve Smith, deputy managing director of Carratu International, a
respected corporate investigation company which itself has been bugged.
He tells the story of the bogus British Telecom engineers who have been
tracked down more than once in the City. 'They have all the right gear and
all the know-how. They tap identified lines from pavement junction boxes and
listen in from a vehicle parked nearby. We've discovered their activities
several times. But it's always too late to catch them.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Builders to probe conduct of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDERS ARE to monitor the behaviour of banks, which they claim are
unnecessarily forcing businesses into liquidation.
The campaign, called Bank Watch, has been launched by the Chartered
Institute of Building, which represents more than 30,000 managers and
directors of construction companies.
The move, announced yesterday, came two days after 18 MPs put their names to
an early day motion expressing concern at Clydesdale Bank's 'cynical'
decision to call in the receivers at Lilley Group, the Glasgow-based
construction company.
Mr Julian Barlow, institute commercial director, said that there had been a
sharp rise in members' complaints of undue pressure from banks leading to an
increase in bankruptcies and liquidations.
'Companies become even more vulnerable when a recession ends and land prices
start to rise again and banks can see an opportunity to get their money back
from selling assets,' he said.
'We want our members to monitor the behaviour of banks so that we can
prepare a dossier which can be presented as evidence to lending
institutions, MPs and government ministers.'
Lilley Group was put into receivership after a rescue package failed to
obtain the unanimous support of its bankers.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Ike's favourite soon to join the fray: The Jeep's entry into
the four-wheel-drive leisure market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER Corporation yesterday returned to the UK vehicle market for the
first time since selling its British manufacturing assets to Peugeot of
France in the late 1970s.
Initially it is battling for sales in one of the few sectors to have grown
during the recession - the off-road four-wheel-drive market. Such vehicles
have become fashionable among city dwellers who may never do any off-road
driving.
Chrysler's offering is the Jeep, possibly the world's best known name in
four-wheel-drive. The first military versions, along with landing craft and
the Douglas Dakota aircraft, were credited by President Dwight D. Eisenhower
 -nicknamed Ike - with winning the second world war.
The Cherokee, the Jeep model which most closely rivals Rover's successful
Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover models, and the Wrangler, a much
revised version of the machine for which President Eisenhower had such
affection, are to tackle a UK four-wheel-drive leisure sector where sales
were estimated at more than 40,000 last year.
A measure of the seriousness with which Chrysler is taking the UK market is
that the Cherokee has been re-engineered as a right-hand-drive model. The
company says it is the first volume production model built with
right-hand-drive for export to the UK by a north American manufacturer.
According to Land Rover, UK sales of larger vehicles in the category -
typified by the Discovery and Range Rover and imports such as Toyota's Land
Cruiser and the Mitsubishi Shogun - reached 27,960 in the first 11 months of
last year. That was a 38.4 per cent jump on the 20,207 during the same
period in 1991.
The market is due to become more crowded later this year when Ford and
Nissan launch their respective badged versions of a vehicle similar in size
to the Discovery. This model will be produced at Nissan's Motor Iberica
plant in Spain, and will be sold in Europe under both Nissan and Ford names.
The vehicle, code-named ET by Nissan which has yet to give it a brand name,
are to be built at a rate of 50,000 a year. Both parties are cautious about
predicting market prospects in the UK.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said the company had set no
firm sales targets for the vehicle. 'We will have to see how sales develop
after it is launched in late spring,' he said.
Sales of the smaller, cheaper four-wheel-drive leisure vehicles such as
Vauxhall's Frontera Sport, which are becoming fashionable among younger
drivers as an alternative to sports cars, also rose sharply in the first 11
months of last year. They increased by just under 20 per cent to 9,698 from
8,112. For Vauxhall the target is to topple Suzuki's Vitara, which accounted
for 5,800 of these sales.
The Jeeps will be sold through an initial network of 80 dealers.
Mr Richard Mackay, managing director of Chrysler Jeep Imports UK, expects
this network to grow steadily as Chrysler's market presence becomes
established. His company is based in Dover and was set up by TKM, the
multi-franchise vehicle distributor and retailer.
With Wrangler prices starting at less than Pounds 13,000 and the Cherokee at
Pounds 15,345, initial sales of at least 2,000 a year are expected.
Mr Mackay, rival importers and Land Rover executives all believe that there
remains a great deal of growth in the leisure four-wheel-drive sector, which
has quadrupled in the UK in less than a decade.
The sector, once dominated by utilitarian vehicles such as the Land Rover,
has grown largely as a result of Japanese importers. They have broadened the
market with a variety of vehicles of all sizes, and with those such as the
cheapest Suzuki models costing little more than a small hatchback.
Mr John Norman, Suzuki GB's managing director, believes the marketing to
young buyers of the SJ model as a leisure vehicle was a crucial factor in
changing British attitudes towards such vehicles. The SJ was depicted in one
advertising campaign as a 'wild weekender'.
Rover Group's Land Rover subsidiary has been the prime beneficiary of the
trend.
With its Range Rover model having secured a similar 'lifestyle' niche at the
top end of the market, the company's launch of its similar-sized but cheaper
Discovery model in 1989 has proved more successful than even it had hoped.
Discoveries have replaced more traditional estate cars across large swathes
of suburbia, and the model is the undisputed UK market leader with nearly
10,000 sales last year.
Chrysler's market research indicates there are some 4.5m people aged 24 to
40 with 'active' lifestyles who are potentially receptive to the Pounds 3m
advertising campaign it is about to launch.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Dearer food pushes up underlying inflation rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPWARD PRESSURE on seasonal food prices was the main influence behind the
0.1 per cent rise in underlying inflation last month compared with the
previous month.
The Central Statistical Office said that seasonal food prices were still low
because of plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables. But prices
nevertheless rose more in December than in the same month the previous year.
As a result the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments -
the Treasury's measure of underlying inflation - rose 3.7 per cent in the
year to December compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to November.
The fall in the all-items index from 139.7 in November to 139.2 last month,
which took headline inflation to 2.6 per cent, was the result of further
mortgage rate cuts.
Housing costs fell 2.6 per cent in December compared with the previous month
and the year-on-year rate dropped to 0.5 per cent from 3.5 per cent in the
year to November.
The CSO said the impact of the cut in mortgage interest rates on the
all-items index was tempered by the upward movement of food prices.
Seasonal food prices rose 4 per cent month-on-month, compared with a monthly
rise of only 1.2 per cent in December 1991. Compared with a year ago, prices
are still falling. In the year to December seasonal food prices dropped by
9.9 per cent, a slower fall than in the year to November when prices fell
12.4 per cent.
Non-seasonal food prices rose a modest 0.5 per cent in December, but may
pick up this month as increases are expected for butter, sugar, imported
lamb and poultry.
Continuing falls in the prices of second-hand cars were behind a 0.4 per
cent monthly fall in motoring expenditure prices. Recent cuts in petrol
prices are expected to exert downward pressure on the index this month.
Christmas discounts on wines and spirits pushed alcoholic drinks prices down
by 0.5 per cent on the month.
Household goods prices rose 0.7 per cent on the month, reflecting price
rises on furniture and electrical goods as new stock entered the shops.
Year-on-year prices rose 2.1 per cent compared with 2 per cent in the year
to November.
Clothing and shoe prices fell by 0.5 per cent on the month, the sharpest
fall for any December since 1954. That followed widespread special offers.
The outlook for January is mixed. The headline rate will be pushed down by
lower mortgage rates and a sharp fall in petrol costs, but seasonal food
prices usually rise in January and alcoholic drinks may cost more as
Christmas offers end.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Electronics market forecast to fall 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK market for electrical and electronic equipment is likely to contract
by as much as 2 per cent this year, Mr Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of
the UK subsidiary of Siemens of Germany, predicted yesterday.
He said it would be the first time in more than a decade that the Pounds
37bn market had failed to grow. His prediction casts further doubt on the
prospect of a consumer-led economic recovery this year.
Mr Gehrels said the market had grown consistently by up to 8 per cent a year
over the past 10 years but was generally flat in 1992.
The UK company, however, which includes Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems
and a 40 per cent stake in GPT Holdings, increased revenues by 3.9 per cent
to Pounds 881.3m last year and expects to break the Pounds 1bn barrier this
year. Mr Gehrels said the company was profitable overall, but if the
contribution from the GPT telecommunications joint venture with GEC were
excluded, it was in loss.
He agreed, however, that the company had paid too much for its share of the
joint bid with GEC for Plessey in 1988 and that the cost increases as a
consequence of devaluation on goods imported to the UK were a 'tremendous
problem'.
Last year Siemens UK had exports of Pounds 186m against imports estimated at
Pounds 170m. Siemens spent Pounds 137m on research and development in the UK
last year, equal to 16 per cent of Siemens UK turnover. 'The UK has a great
resource of talented engineers and physicists,' Mr Gehrels said: 'That is
one of the main reasons for Siemens' involvement in the UK.'
The British workforce was less skilled than the German, he said, but this
was not a significant handicap.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Pay freezes spread in construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 20,000 employees of recession-hit construction companies have had
their salaries frozen or cut, a survey by the Financial Times indicated
yesterday. Pay at one group has been cut by 5 per cent.
A separate poll of 80 senior construction executives conducted by Gallup for
Building magazine revealed that almost two thirds of contractors expect to
impose a pay freeze this year.
Costain, the troubled construction and coal mining group, announced last
week that it was seeking to impose a 5 per cent pay cut on its 2,800 UK
staff from April 1. It is also making 150 employees redundant in addition to
the 300 whose redundancies were announced by the group in November.
Trafalgar House Construction, Bovis, Taylor Woodrow and Alfred McAlpine are
among building companies which are imposing pay freezes this year.
Contractors faced with large borrowings, deteriorating order books and
falling profitability are under pressure from banks to restrain overheads.
Costain, as part of a package to reduce costs by Pounds 11m a year, has cut
its entertainment budget and downgraded executive air travel, with senior
managers no longer allowed to fly first class. Company cars will be replaced
with more economic diesel models.
Taylor Woodrow, which last year froze the pay of middle and senior
management, has said there will be no annual salary increase this year for
its 9,000 employees.
The company, which made a Pounds 16m pre-tax loss in the first six months of
last year, has told staff that pay will remain frozen until the economic
situation improves.
The 4,700 workers at Alfred McAlpine, who should have received an annual pay
increase in November, have also had their salaries frozen.
Bovis, which should have increased salaries on January 1, has introduced a
six-month wage freeze for its 1,000 UK construction staff. It says it will
review the position in June.
Trafalgar House Construction froze the pay of its 3,500 UK staff last
October. It says it will review the position this autumn. THC cut its staff
by about 400 last year.
More than 400,000 construction jobs are estimated to have been lost by the
industry since summer 1989.
The Building magazine survey says that 58 per cent of housebuilders, 67 per
cent of building materials producers and 59 per cent of consultants also
propose to introduce pay freezes this year.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Ministers rebuff editors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STORM of press criticism that greeted the Calcutt report on press
regulation was dismissed by the government yesterday as 'special pleading'
as ministers underlined their determination to curb invasions of individual
privacy.
Senior ministers said the unanimous criticism by newspaper editors of the
report prepared by Sir David Calcutt QC showed that the editors had
seriously underestimated the mood at Westminster.
Cabinet members known to take a liberal approach to the issue of press
freedom joined more instinctively hostile colleagues in insisting that the
government was determined to criminalise 'intrusive' behaviour by
newspapers.
Despite their rejection of Sir David's suggestion of a statutory press
tribunal to replace the Press Complaints Commission, the ministers added
that they were determined that voluntary regulation should have 'teeth' by
making the commission more independent.
The government signalled earlier this week that it would legislate against
the use of trespass, bugging devices and other electronic equipment to
intrude on individual privacy.
The strength of feeling within the cabinet against the press, however,
suggests that the promised 'public interest' defence which newspapers could
offer in cases of prominent public figures might be narrowly drawn.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is keen to emphasise the government's
concern with protecting the privacy of ordinary people. But ministers
privately cite cases of the royal family, the resignation of Mr David
Mellor, the former heritage secretary, and attacks on Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, as instances of press coverage going too far.
Mr Major is pressing for the new civil offence of invasion of privacy
suggested by Calcutt.
Ministers acknowledge, however, that without an expensive commitment to
extend legal aid such a law could be exploited only by the affluent.

FT  16 JAN 93 / BA offers customers cocoa and pyjamas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is to offer first-class passengers navy blue pyjamas, a
duvet and a hot milky drink on some overnight flights from next week.
Passengers from New York's Kennedy airport will also be fed while still on
the ground so that they can sleep on the aircraft without interruption.
BA's move may signal the stepping up of the airline's efforts to woo
top-paying passengers. BA's rival, Virgin Atlantic, to which it apologised
earlier this week in the High Court over the 'dirty tricks' affair, has an
in-flight beauty therapist on some flights to Los Angeles.
BA's 'sleeper trials' are the result of customer research which showed that
what passengers wanted above all was a long sleep. 'And they want a nice
milky drink, crisp sheets and a proper-sized pillow,' said the airline.
If the trial succeeds the airline will from April extend the service to many
flights of less than nine hours which fly east after 7pm, although only
passengers from Kennedy airport or Heathrow will be able to enjoy the
pre-flight meal.
BA's 'sleeper trials' recall the 1950s, when passengers could sleep in bunks
on the Boeing Stratocruiser, a propeller aircraft derived from the B-29
bomber and notorious for its noise and vibration.
Since then, sleeping on aircraft has remained a trial, even in first class.
Only Philippine Airlines still offers bunk beds to first class passengers -
on Tuesday flights from London to Manila and more often on trans-Pacific
routes.
Japan Airlines gave up offering bunks on flights to Europe when the
increasing range of modern aircraft allowed it to fly non-stop from Tokyo.
Its inducements now include dressing first-class passengers in colourful
quilted 'happi coats' and the use of a personal massage machine.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Culture and comfort weaken Scottish appetite for new
business: A lack of regard for the entrepreneur is stifling company
start-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN leading Scots were asked what they felt about their country's poor
record on company creation, they gave replies which some will find
disturbing.
'New firms cause competition and displacement,' said one. 'This is not
always an advantage to the economy.'
'In the long term a few start-up businesses might help but I don't see them
as crucial,' said another.
'We would not need new firms if we paid attention to assisting and rescuing
old businesses,' was another view. This suggestion of complacency - if not
hostility - towards rising entrepreneurs is a sign of a cultural problem
which appears to be a factor in limiting growth of new businesses, and
holding back the Scottish economy.
Research by Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, shows that
Scotland's business birth rate for companies of more than 50 people between
1978 and 1990 was 77 new companies per 1m of population. The figure for the
west Midlands was 86 and for south-east England it was 116. All were dwarfed
by the performance of Massachusetts in the US with 333.
In 1990 125,000 people were working in independent businesses in Scotland
set up since 1978 - but an extra 70,000 jobs would have been created if
Scottish business formation had matched that of the west Midlands, and
320,000 if growth had been as strong as in the south-east.
Not that the Scottish economy is in terminal decline. Over the past two
decades it has escaped its dependence on heavy industry and has achieved
more balance. It has also suffered less severely from the recession than
much of the rest of Britain. In a country of 5m people fewer than 250,000
are registered unemployed.
But why should Scotland, whose entrepreneurs thrived in the 19th century and
whose expatriates head important businesses in England, California and
elsewhere, generate relatively few at home?
Scottish Enterprise's research, carried out by nine firms of consultants,
says culture is partly to blame. Scots rated the entrepreneur as fifth most
admired profession below teachers, bankers and manual workers such as
plumbers and bus drivers.
The English put entrepreneurs third after teachers and bankers, and Germans
put them after teachers. Entrepreneurs were not perceived as being the
caring sort of people Scots are educated to admire. And interviews with
people in the business and financial community, as well as trade unionists,
academics, journalists and churchmen, revealed serious doubts about the
value of new businesses.
Many believed it would be better to concentrate on helping existing
companies and encouraging a continuing stream of inward investors.
In spite of what might seem a discouraging cultural environment, Scottish
Enterprise's research showed that 570,000 men and 285,000 women - 19 per
cent of the adult population - would like to start businesses and believe
they are capable of it. That was the same proportion as for Britain as a
whole, though below the south-east's 21 per cent.
But only 7 per cent of Scotland's potential entrepreneurs had taken up the
challenge compared with 13.7 per cent in southern England. The main reason
was difficulty raising finance. As elsewhere borrowers complain that lenders
are too cautious, and lenders say the projects are not good enough.
Two distinct Scottish factors play a part. One is that Scots tend to have
less personal wealth than people in other parts of Britain. Slightly more
than half of Scots own their homes compared with more than two thirds in
England. Only 35 per cent were owner occupiers in 1979.
Since much lending for new ventures is secured on the house of the founder,
Scots have less borrowing potential. Scottish houses are generally less
valuable than those in southern England, so Scots may have less free equity
in their house.
It is often said that Scotland is a village in which everybody knows
somebody - ideal territory, it might be thought, for 'networking', by which
people with business projects contact individuals with money to invest.
Yet the research showed that networking works poorly in Scotland, because
many would-be entrepreneurs are slow to discuss ideas with friends, and many
are not members of clubs and associations.
And the quality of life may mean those people who do form companies satisfy
their ambitions relatively early, to the detriment of expansion.
'The quality of life in Scotland is just too good and doesn't cost much to
get a good slice of,' one venture capitalist says. 'If you are making Pounds
100,000 after tax from a business, you can afford a nice house and access to
open space that in the south would need a much bigger income. For some,
life's too comfortable.'

FT  16 JAN 93 / Council chiefs fear that 33,000 staff will be shed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 33,000 jobs will be lost in local government in England over the
next year mainly because of government spending curbs according to a survey
of council chief executives published yesterday.
But those figures could be exaggerated, judging from another study released
yesterday. It found that the number of job losses in local government last
year was far lower than that expected before final budgets for 1992-93 were
agreed in March.
A survey by Local Government Chronicle of 140 councils employing 1.3m of the
1.6m staff in English councils found chief executives estimating that at
least 33,000 jobs will be lost between now and April 1994. They thought that
13,000 of those would occur within the next three months.
'Other councils contacted said there would be job losses, but they had yet
to calculate them - making the LGC figure an absolute minimum,' it said.
The 140 councils surveyed said that they would need an extra Pounds 1.23bn
from the government to maintain existing staffing and service levels, in
addition to the Pounds 21bn of government support already pledged for
1993-94.
When this year's grant settlement was announced, Mr Michael Howard, the
environment secretary, said that it would 'enable councils to maintain
existing service provision', with 'no need for job losses'.
However, a Municipal Journal survey of local government job losses in the
year to September 1992 reports that 10,300 jobs were lost. That was well
below the predictions that were made by councils earlier in the year.
Several authorities that had predicted redundancies in fact increased their
staffing levels.
Mr Michael Burton, the survey editor, said: 'The picture in the end was
unpleasant but considerably less gloomy than envisaged as far as jobs went.'
Mr John Redwood, local government minister, dismissed reports of large-scale
compulsory redundancies as 'speculative'.

THE LIQUIDATORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
were given High Court approval yesterday to hold a creditors' meeting in
London, Richard Donkin writes.
Touche Ross, the firm acting as liquidators, expects about 5,000 creditors
to attend the meeting at Wembley Arena on May 27. It is being held for
creditors of BCCI SA, the Luxembourg-registered arm of the bank which ran
all of BCCI's UK branches.
Some 140,000 creditors worldwide are potentially eligible to attend. So far
Touche Ross has received 29,000 proof-of-debt forms from BCCI SA depositors
worldwide. Of those, 5,000 have been returned from UK-based BCCI depositors
who had accounts in British branches of the bank.

FT  16 JAN 93 / CBI seeks tax exemption on redundancy counselling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES who are made redundant should be exempt from tax on the cost of
counselling provided by their employers, the Confederation of British
Industry said yesterday.
The recommendation, in the CBI's proposals to the government about the
Budget, is directed at managers and higher paid workers whose redundancy
packages exceed Pounds 30,000, the point at which tax begins to bite on such
packages.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general, says that the effect of the tax
is to make it more likely that employees decline the offer of outplacement
counselling - advice on obtaining a new job.
'That is to their disadvantage because those who receive the counselling
usually find new employment more quickly than those who do not,' said Mr
Davies.
'It is also to the disadvantage of the economy as a whole not to have these
employees back in jobs as quickly as possible,' he added.
The CBI's suggestion is one of 40 contained in its tax proposals sent to Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Others include a proposal to allow the costs of 'green' measures to be tax
deductible; proper recognition for tax purposes of the gains and losses from
foreign exchange transactions; and harmonisation between the treatment of
incidental costs arising from the raising of equity finance, which are not
allowable against tax, and those from raising loan capital, which are
allowable.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Press body lay members angered by Calcutt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAY MEMBERS of the Press Complaints Commission yesterday expressed outrage
that their independence had apparently been called into question by Sir
David Calcutt's review of self-regulation of the press.
The Calcutt report described the commission as 'the creature of the
newspaper industry', and said that it could not fairly hold the balance
between the individual and the press.
Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, former chairman of the Inner London Juvenile
Courts and a founding member of the commission, said yesterday: 'I think it
is highly offensive to suggest we are a creature of the newspaper industry.
This is the most independent body in the country.'
Lady Cavendish said she could not remember a single occasion when commission
members had been split along newspaper industry-lay member lines.
Lord Colnbrook, formerly Mr Humphrey Atkins, a former Conservative minister,
said: 'All the lay members of the PCC are totally independent. I'm retired
now and I don't give a damn about what the press think of me.'
He said he believed that Sir David's assessment that the commission and
self-regulation had not worked had been 'strongly coloured by the fact the
government didn't carry out all the things he recommended'.
Lord Colnbrook said Sir David had not been to see the commission at work.
Lay members say Sir David had lunch with them, but did not ask questions
about how they approached their task and declined an invitation to stay to
watch an adjudication session.
The lay members are outnumbered by those with newspaper connections on the
commission. They include Dame Mary Donaldson, a former Lord Mayor of London,
Professor Lesley Rees, dean of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College
in London, and Professor Robert Pinker, professor of social work studies at
the London School of Economics.
Sir David Chipp, a former editor-in-chief of the Press Association, said
yesterday that he was 'very cross indeed' about any questioning of his
independence.
Meanwhile, lawyers were starting to highlight the practical difficulties of
implementing privacy measures, particularly restraining publication,
throughout the UK.
'There is a perennial difficulty in getting injunctions enforceable
throughout the UK,' said Mr Michael Smith, a media specialist and partner at
law firm Clifford Chance.
The Calcutt proposals are aimed at least initially only at England and
Wales. Northern Ireland is not mentioned.
'A prominent figure could be 'doorstepped' unlawfully in London but
'doorstepped' in exactly the the same way in Belfast perfectly legally,' Mr
Smith said.

<TEXT>
THE government yesterday indicated support in principle for a Labour MP's
bill to increase information on the safety of medicines - but its qualified
endorsement means the proposals are unlikely to become law.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, backed more openness in the drugs
industry but said there were parts of the bill with which the government
would have difficulties.
Much information supplied by pharmaceutical companies to drug licencesing
authorities was highly sensitive commercially, he said.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, said his Medicines Information
Bill would give patients more information about the risks and benefits of
drugs.
However, Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, warned that it
could have a 'devastating' effect on the pharmaceutical industry, which
strongly opposes the measures.
The bill was given a second reading in the Commons but will almost certainly
require a more positive government stance to become law. It is backed by the
Consumers' Association and the Campaign for Freedom of Information.
At present, section 118 of the 1968 Medicines Act makes it a criminal
offence for officials to disclose information about the safety of medicines
supplied by pharmaceutical manufacturers to licensing authorities.
Mr Radice regards the bill as a test of the government's commitment to
reducing secrecy. It seeks to overcome fears about the confidentiality of
information by restricting access to those who have no links with the
pharmaceutical industry.

The US Treasury said yesterday it was cancelling some development loan debts
to Argentina and Jamaica as part of President Bush's Enterprise for the
Americas Initiative.
Jamaica's foreign aid debt to the US was slashed by 70 per cent to about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m), and Argentina's by 10 per cent to Dollars 34.3m.
Both governments are expected to enter into special 'Americas Framework
Agreements' with the US which would donate interest payments on the
remaining debt to local environmental groups and child development projects.
The payments would be in local currency. The plan is expected to generate
about Dollars 3.1m for projects in Argentina over 15 years and Dollars 12.3m
for Jamaica over 20 years.

The country's rival warlords, Ali Mahdi Mohamed (pictured right) and Mohamed

the pact, heavy weapons will be turned over to the UN.
But few western diplomats, UN officials or Somalis believe that Somali
militias or freelance gunmen will easily surrender the weapons which give
them power.
The UN is hoping all factions will attend talks in March aimed at setting up
a transitional government.

The Quebec Court of Appeal, in a test case, has upheld a federal government

A lower court had found the ban unconstitutional and the federal government
had appealed. The tobacco industry, which has complied with the federal ban
since 1989, said it would almost certainly take the case to the Supreme
Court of Canada. The three big tobacco producers seeking a final ruling on
the ban are led by Imasco, the Canadian arm of BAT Industries.

BRAZILIAN inflation reached 1,149 per cent last year, according to official

this is well up on the 475 per cent of the previous year, though lower than
1989 and 1990 when it reached 1,864 and 1,585 per cent respectively.
Economists see little reason to hope for a decline soon. The official
consumer price index has been rising by more than 20 per cent a month for
the last 14 months and Mr Carlos Antonio Luque, president of the Order of
Economists of Sao Paulo, predicts inflation of 27 per cent for this month -

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL achieved single-digit inflation for the first time in 23 years in
1992, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported yesterday.
The Consumer Price Index rose 9.4 per cent last year, down from 18 per cent
in 1991. The key factors behind the sharp drop were a significant slowdown
in housing price increases, due to sluggish demand in the market, and
relatively low wage increases in most sectors owing to high unemployment.
Since 1985, when the government implemented an emergency economic
stabilisation programme to combat hyperinflation, the annual increase in the
CPI had stabilised at around 18 per cent.
The inflation figure was welcomed by treasury and central bank officials,
who said it had not interfered with the country's other main economic target
of higher growth. Israel's GNP rose by over 6 per cent in 1992, according to
preliminary forecasts.
Mr Dov Lautman, President of the Israel Manufacturers' Association, hinted
that the government should take advantage of low inflation to allow a
further devaluation of the shekel, to improve export profitability.' It's
now possible to exploit this situation of single-digit inflation, combined
with high unemployment, to initiate a more energetic policy of growth
without fearing a resurgence of inflation.'
Housing prices rose only 5.4 per cent last year. The reason for the sharp
drop was the slowdown in the number of immigrants arriving in the country
from the former Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
THE Dutch government is to give companies tax incentives to encourage them
to buy electric vehicles.
Dutch businesses which invest in electric-powered company cars are to be
allowed accelerated depreciation of the vehicles under a new scheme designed
to promote the use of electric cars.
The pressures on the car industry to accelerate the development of electric
vehicles are intensifying. Toyota and Nissan, the two leading Japanese car
makers are joining forces to develop an electric car, according to Japanese
newspaper reports yesterday.
The newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said that Toyota and Nissan had begun talks
on the development of common electric vehicle components. Japan's ministry
of international trade and industry has set a target of having about 200,000
domestic electric cars in use by the year 2000.
Last month the big three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,
announced that they planned to co-operate more closely in the development of
electric vehicles.
The three companies have signed an agreement to investigate co-operation in
the design, development, testing and possible manufacturing of electric
vehicle components which would ultimately be used in each company's own
vehicles.
Two years ago the US car makers also formed a consortium to carry out
research and development on advanced batteries that would be capable of
providing electric vehicles with significantly increased range and
performance.
The state of California has been at the forefront of seeking to encourage
the use of electric vehicles through regulation - by 1998, 2 per cent of
cars sold in California are to be so-called zero emissions vehicles.
Yesterday's move by the Dutch government is one of the first inititaives in
Europe to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles through the use of tax
incentives.
The Dutch environment ministry said that electric cars have been placed on a
list of 400 environmentally-friendly products that provide tax breaks to
companies which purchase them. Thanks to the move, companies will be able to
set off against tax the full price of an electric-powered vehicle in the
first year of purchase. Petrol-powered company cars, by contrast, are
normally written off over five years in the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
ANGOLAN government forces pounded the Unita rebel headquarters at Huambo
with artillery again yesterday as prospects for early peace talks to halt
renewed civil war grew slimmer, Reuter reports from Luanda.
Diplomats said last-minute conditions presented by Unita threw into question
a meeting between the rival military chiefs in Addis Ababa initially planned
for the weekend or early next week.
Ms Margaret Anstee, UN special representative, was working to ensure
government chief of staff General Joao de Matos and Unita General Demostenes
Chilingutila met, they said.
Government troops yesterday pressed on with their week-long assault on
Huambo, Angola's second city and Unita's headquarters in the central
highlands, with intense shelling by artillery and tanks.
The battle for Huambo is the centrepiece of the struggle for power between
the two sides, whose 16-year civil war was supposed to have ended with a
peace accord signed in May 1991.
The Addis Ababa contact would have been the first high-level meeting since
the new spate of warfare.

THE political crisis caused by Danish Prime Minister Poul Schluter's
resignation seems likely to lead to the formation of a minority Social
Democratic Party government. Yesterday Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the SDP
leader, was asked by Queen Margrethe to lead negotiations among the
Folketing's eight parties on forming a new government.
Mr Rasmussen was recommended by the SDP, the left-wing Socialist People's
Party and the centrist Radical Liberal Party, which have a narrow majority
in the Folketing.
The financial markets reacted positively to the prospect of a change of
regime after 10 years of non-socialist governments led by Mr Schluter. The
krone strengthened and bond prices firmed.
Miss Anne Jensen, chief economist at Unibank, said the reaction reflected
market expectations that an SDP government would be better able to mobilise
a majority for a Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty in the second referendum
which Denmark will hold later this year, probably in May.
Mr Schluter, who was severely criticised for misleading the Folketing over
the Tamil visa scandal by a judicial inquiry on Thursday, formally handed
his resignation to Queen Margrethe yesterday.
He remains in office until a new government is formed. Mr Rasmussen will be
asked by the Queen to form a government when he can show he has sufficient
support in parliament.
If the inter-party negotiations reach an impasse, an election would have to
be held. The 49-year-old SDP leader, who was once chief economist to the
Confederation of Danish Trade Unions, faces tough negotiations, which may
take several days.
The Radical Liberals, whose seven members of the Folketing hold the balance
of power between the socialist and non-socialist parties, have said they
will support an SDP government provided it promises to carry out labour
market and tax reforms.
Since 1982 the Radicals have supported Mr Schluter, but for several months
have flirted with the idea of a change of government.
The Radicals want changes to the country's exceptionally generous
unemployment benefits and other reforms to make the labour market more
flexible in order to help bring down the 11 per cent unemployment rate.
They also want lower marginal income taxes. Neither the labour market
reforms, strongly opposed by trade unions, nor the tax reform proposals are
liked by the SDP.
Mr Ivar Noergaard, chairman of the Folketing's influential European market
affairs committee, yesterday dismissed as exaggerated the concern expressed
abroad that the Danish presidency of the European Council would be seriously
affected by the political crisis.
Denmark's European policies are thrashed out in detail in the all-party
market affairs committee. For this reason 'it does not signify very much
which party is actually the government party,' he said, although new
ministers would naturally need time to master the details of their brief.
A change of government, he added, would not mean any changes in the senior
civil service personnel who handle European questions.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Rao pledges financial help to victims of violence in Bombay

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR P V NARASIMHA RAO, the Indian prime minister, yesterday made a flying
visit to strife-torn Bombay and pledged financial help for the victims of
the city's violence.
The mission was a belated attempt to answer criticisms that the central
government has done little to quell the violence, which, according to
hospital estimates, has claimed 600 lives in Bombay alone and caused
widespread damage.
Over 50,000 have fled the city. Police and troops have restored order to
most districts, but there were reports of further violence, including at
least two deaths, yesterday as the premier toured the city under heavy
guard.
Businessmen were counting the cost following the second spate of violence
since Hindu militants tore down a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya six
week ago. The demolition unleashed a nationwide wave of inter-religious
violence.
Many businesses were still shut yesterday for the 10th day in succession,
while others closed early to allow workers to reach home before dark.
The Indian Merchants Chamber, a trade group, estimated lost production in
Bombay this month at Rs13.5bn (Pounds 5.9bn). Mr KRV Subramaniam, a former
president of Bombay Chamber of Commerce, said it would take six months for
output to return to normal. The whole economy will suffer since Bombay is
the commercial capital and accounts for 35 per cent of the nation's exports.
Moslems have been the chief victims of the violence - singled out for attack
by Shiv Sena, a Bombay-based right wing Hindu political party with close
links to the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main national opposition party.
Shiv Sena has openly boasted of 'teaching Moslems a lesson.' The violence
has been aggravated by criminals taking advantage of the turmoil for
looting, extortion and grabbing land by driving Moslems out of their homes.
Moslems also claim the police have often stood aside giving Hindu mobs free
reign.

FT  16 JAN 93 / US-EC tariff talks grind to halt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between the US and the European Community on lowering tariffs for
industrial goods have ground to a halt, and no further negotiations are
planned before next Tuesday's meeting of senior trade diplomats in the
Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks.
Earlier this month, the two sides agreed to work for a tariff deal by
January 15 that could pave the way for an early overall Uruguay round
accord. But 'the ingredients for a deal aren't there', an EC official said
yesterday.
The future of the six-year-old round, already more than two years behind
schedule, now depends on the attitude of the Clinton administration, which
takes over on January 20. Trade officials in Geneva say that, until a new
trade team is up and running in Washington, the negotiations cannot move
forward on any of the important issues outstanding.
Both sides are blaming each other for the lack of progress in the tariff
talks which foundered on the trade-off between cuts in high US duties on
textiles and the reduction or elimination of EC tariffs in a broad range of
sectors including non-ferrous metals, wood and electronics.
Community officials said yesterday the US had still not made a detailed
offer on textiles. American negotiators say the EC tariff offer contains
'very significant gaps in coverage'.
Despite the stand-off over tariffs, negotiators in the 108-nation round
yesterday continued to try to whittle down obstacles to a Uruguay round
agreement on fair trade rules before Tuesday's meeting.
Officials said several ad hoc technical groups had been set up on specific
areas of disagreement. These include changes to the draft rules package
being pressed by the US concerning environmental and consumer standards for
food and other products, and stronger protection for pharmaceutical patents
and the US entertainment industry.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Senators give new cabinet easy ride

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF President-elect Bill Clinton is having trouble filling the jobs in his
administration, the blame cannot be laid at the door of the Senate, which
has so far offered a smooth ride to his cabinet nominees in their
confirmation hearings.
A few have faced mild interrogation on past peccadilloes - Ms Zoe Baird,
designated to be Attorney General, has become a symbol of a generation of
yuppies for hiring an illegal alien as a nanny - but on policy issues, the
Republicans have so far not lived up to their threats of stiff scrutiny.
Beside Mr Warren Christopher, who as Secretary of State-designate underwent
two days of intellectual duelling with Senator Jesse Helms, the senior
Republican on the foreign relations committee, only Ms Donna Shalala has
encountered anything resembling tough questioning - and that has come mostly
from the Democrats.
In hearings this week Ms Shalala, who has been chosen to head the Department
of Health and Human Services, was criticised for focusing her statement
almost entirely on health care reform, largely ignoring welfare reform,
which has been a central concern for some Democrats.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee,
said he was distressed by 'the clatter of campaign promises being tossed out
the window,' and Senator Jay Rockefeller, another Democrat who has taken the
lead on health and social issues, said he heard rumours that, for strategic
and political reasons, 'welfare reform is going to be put on a back burner.'
But the Senate can certainly not be accused of holding Mr Clinton up in the
task of building his administration. Many committees have already voted for
confirmation of the cabinet members who have come before them, even though
Mr Clinton cannot actually nominate them until he is inaugurated next
Wednesday. Most cabinet secretaries are expected to be formally confirmed on
Wednesday or Thursday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Somalia's feuding factions signed a pact yesterday to disarm their unruly
militias and end the fighting which led to the deaths by starvation of more
than 300,000 people, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa.
The country's rival warlords, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Mohamed Farah Aideed,
signed the agreement with their allies after more than a week of talks.
But few Western diplomats, UN officials or Somalis believe that Somali
militias or freelance gunmen will easily surrender the weapons which give
them power.
Aideed brought the talks to the brink of collapse several times by refusing
to attend a national reconciliation conference in March on an equal footing
with his rivals. He wants a special status to reflect the major role his
militias played in ousting Siad Barre in January 1991, the event that turned
an impoverished nation into a patchwork of clan fiefdoms as the warlords
battled to succeed him.
Eleven rival factions, aligned with Ali Mahdi, agreed this week to sign the
ceasefire and pledge to disarm their militias. But adoption of the pact was
held up by haggling over who should attend the March talks.
The issue was passed to a committee to make recommendations to the UN
organisers of the March talks, which are supposed to set up a transitional
government, the first national authority Somalia will have had since Siad
Barre's overthrow.

FT  16 JAN 93 / US inflation rate bonus for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration will inherit the best inflation outlook for a
generation, according to figures released yesterday.
Data on production and exports, however, confirm that the pace of recovery
from recession is likely to remain subdued by the standards of previous
upturns.
The Labour Department said consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month and
by 2.9 per cent in the year to December. With the exception of a temporary
dip in inflation below 2 per cent in 1986, reflecting the halving of oil
prices that year, this was the lowest annual increase since the mid-1960s.
The fall in inflation from an underlying rate of about 5 per cent in the
late 1980s reflects a long period of economic stagnation and the
conservative monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank,
which lowered interest rates only gradually during the recession.
Some analysts, however, fear that if the recovery gains momentum,
inflationary pressures will re-emerge later this year or in 1994.
The outlook for production remains modestly encouraging. The Fed yesterday
reported a 0.3 per cent rise in industrial output last month, taking the
annual increase to 2.9 per cent. This followed a 0.4 per cent rise in
November and a revised increase of 0.7 per cent in October.
The improvement was uneven, with much of last month's gain reflecting a 5
per cent surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts. Production of
information processing and industrial equipment was also strong.
However, excluding cars, overall output of consumer goods was flat last
month. The rate of capacity utilisation in industry inched higher to 79.3
per cent against 79.2 per cent in November.
Separately the Commerce Department reported an increase in the merchandise
trade deficit to Dollars 7.6bn in November against Dollars 7.2bn in October.
This reflected a 2.8 per cent decline in exports which was only partially
offset by a smaller percentage decline in imports.
The trade deficit deteriorated sharply in the second half of last year as
the US domestic recovery coincided with a downturn in many overseas markets,
including Europe and Japan.
The deficit for the first 11 months of last year was Dollars 75.5bn against
Dollars 59.2bn in the same period of 1991. Most analysts are projecting a
further deterioration this year as higher demand in an expanding US economy
sucks in more imports.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Commission warns Japan over trade imbalance
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday warned Japanese ministers that political
co-operation between the EC and Japan would be undermined by a failure to
improve the two partners' bilateral trade imbalance.
The Japanese responded by suggesting Community businesses should try harder
to penetrate the Japanese market.
Mr Hans van den Broek, the new commissioner for external relations, and Sir
Leon Brittan, who has taken over the trade portfolio, led a team of
commissioners meeting five senior Japanese ministers in Brussels.
The meeting was the culmination of two days of talks on political and
economic relations, at which Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign
minister, and his colleagues promised to implement measures aimed at
encouraging EC exports and investment in Japan.
Japan has been eager to develop its political relations with the EC since
signing a joint co-operation declaration in 1991. But tension between the
two blocs has been exacerbated by Japan's growing surplus on trade with the
Community, which rose more than 17 per cent in the first 11 months of 1992
to Dollars 29.2bn (Pounds 19.2bn).
The Commission claimed yesterday that Japan and the EC had taken the first
step towards systematic analysis of the trade surplus, by arranging a
meeting of experts to discuss the figures before April. Brussels believes
regular monitoring of the statistics will enable both sides to spot areas
where EC exports appear to be hampered. But Mr Seiji Morimoto, spokesman for
Mr Watanabe, said that although there was general agreement on the principle
of such monitoring, the details had to be worked out. He said Japan believed
regular analysis would demonstrate that the trade surplus was often
distorted by currency fluctuation and price changes.
The two sides also touched on the sensitive issue of Japanese car exports to
the EC. Publicly, both the Commission and the Japanese claimed to be happy
with the memorandum of understanding signed in 1991, under which Japan
'monitors' its exports to the Community. But a row is already brewing about
the likely increase in Japanese exports during 1993, when the EC car market
is expected to shrink.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Russia promises Ukraine: no nuclear war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of Russia and Ukraine last night announced tentative agreements
on two of the most pressing issues dividing the two Slav states - though
large differences remain, particularly on repayment of the foreign debt.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, said last night Russia was prepared to
give neighbouring Ukraine a guarantee against nuclear attack, in return for
Ukrainian parliament ratification of the Start 1 treaty and return of its
strategic nuclear missiles to Russia.
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said that the guarantee would
help him persuade the country's parliament to ratify Start 1 - necessary if
the treaty, signed between the US and the Soviet Union in July 1991, is to
be implemented and Start 2, signed by Russia and the US early this month, is
to proceed.
Mr Yeltsin also said that Russia would provide up to 5m more tonnes of oil
above the 15m tonne limit it set for supplies to Ukraine this year in
earlier talks. Ukraine, now desperately short of oil supplies for its
refineries, had requested 45m tonnes - but Mr Yeltsin said that because of
an expected drop in Russian oil production to under 400m tonnes in 1993,
'unfortunately we cannot satisfy Ukraine's needs.'
Confusion surrounds both the level of supplies and the method of payment. Mr
Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, was quoted by the news agency
Interfax after talks with Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian premier, on
Thursday, as saying that only 11m tonnes of oil would go to Ukraine this
year, and that it would be paid for by supplies of food and industrial
goods, with both the Russian oil and Ukrainian products denominated in hard
currency.
Russia had announced its intention to move to world prices for its oil sold
to the other 14 former Soviet states - but has only implemented the
intention in the case of the three Baltic republics. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko,
the first deputy premier, said yesterday that because of the close links
between Russian and other states' industries and economies, 'a standard
approach of charging world prices should not be expected.'
The nuclear guarantee, however, is a move for which Ukraine has lobbied in
the past few months, and may stimulate similar guarantees from the other
main nuclear powers, the US, Britain and France. Mr Borys Tarasiuk, the
Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, has raised the issue of all-round nuclear
guarantees in the event of Ukraine giving up the 176 missiles on its
territory, and received encouragement from the western allies.
Start 1 has still to be ratified by Ukraine and by Belarus, but has been
ratified by Kazakhstan, the fourth of the former Soviet states to possess
nuclear weapons.
Talks will continue over the weekend on the repayment of the former Soviet
debt of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 52.6bn). Ukraine has insisted on separate
repayment of its 16.34 per cent of the debt in return for a share of the
overseas assets, a deal the overseas creditors in the London and Paris Clubs
have so far rejected.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the Paris Club, and Mr Christian Vontz,
a Deutsche Bank director who chairs the London Club's Paris group, arrived
in Moscow yesterday to conduct talks on the debt with Russian and Ukrainian
ministers. An agreement between them is essential for rescheduling the debt
and for the release of more loans to the former Soviet states.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S inflation rate fell marginally in 1992 to 5.4 per cent, from 5.5 per
cent in 1991.
This was a considerable improvement on government forecasts early last year
of 6.4 per cent rise in the consumer price index by December.
Underlying inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and non-processed
food prices, rose by just 0.2 percentage points last month, the lowest
monthly rise of 1992, to give a rate for the year of 6.9 per cent.
The figures, published yesterday by the government's statistics institute,
reflected the depressed state of the domestic economy. Independent
economists estimate zero growth in the last quarter of last year and growth
of about 1 per cent overall in 1992.
Mr Jose Luis Feito, chief analyst of the Madrid securities firm of
Asesosores Bursatlies, said the downward trend in prices would continue in
coming months. There was unlikely to be any meaningful easing of interest
rates soon.
Lower inflation appears likely following a recommendation by the employers'
federation to hold salary increases this year below 3 per cent. The
government has already taken the lead on wage moderation by fixing the
increase of the minimum wage at just 4 per cent, the lowest annual increase
for a decade, and in effect freezing wage increases in the public sector.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S cabinet yesterday approved wide-ranging measures to boost popular
share ownership ahead of its ambitious privatisation programme.
The steps, originally expected last month, include tax breaks for investors
in newly-quoted companies and the chance to swap holdings in government
bonds for privatised shares.
The keenly-expected draft law, which has still to be approved by parliament,
yesterday pushed share prices upwards. The Comit share index closed up 10.44
at 478.62, after a strong week in which shares have climbed on the back of
strong foreign and domestic buying.
Among the most important measures was a 27 per cent tax break to investors
on purchases of up to L7.5m (Pounds 3,560) a year in shares of newly floated
companies - if the stock is held for at least three years. The measure
amounts to a L2m annual tax reduction to investors buying their full
entitlement of shares.
Ministers also opened the door for investors to exchange government bonds
for shares in newly-privatised companies controlled by the treasury. The
bonds, likely to be immediately retired, would directly reduce the
outstanding stock of state debt. The bonds would have to have a minimum five
years' maturity.
Other steps approved include independent funding for Consob, Italy's
companies and stock market watchdog, which would now 'charge' for its
services through some form of levy on share trading. The cabinet also gave
the go-ahead to the concept of the 'golden share' to guarantee a state role
in some newly-privatised concerns.
Investors would also be able to choose how their dividends are taxed. The
current highly complex system includes a flat-rate 10 per cent withholding
tax and the inclusion of dividend receipts in annual income tax returns.
Investors would be able to opt for a 30 per cent tax at source.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Stockholm sets 2% inflation target

SWEDEN'S central bank, the Riksbank, said yesterday price stability was its
'over-riding objective' as it set an inflation target of 2 per cent a year
for the economy from 1995.
This was the first specific policy statement from the bank since Sweden was
compelled to float the krona last November. It came a day after the bank
intervened in the markets to support the currency for the first time since
then.
For 1993 and 1994, the bank is aiming to hold underlying inflation to 2 per
cent, although actual inflation will rise to some 5 per cent this year,
following the depreciation of the krona and an increase in indirect taxes.
'Price increases in excess of 5 per cent cannot be tolerated,' said the
central bank.
It did not signal any reduction in its key marginal rate, which stands at
10.5 per cent, nor did it suggest any specific exchange rate targets.
The bank has set the inflation target to cover the time that the krona
continues to float, but wants a return to a fixed exchange rate when
conditions allow.
Yesterday's policy statement had little impact on the krona, which has
fallen victim to a new round of currency speculation since the New Year. It
was yesterday trading at around SKr4.45 to the D-Mark in London, little
changed from the SKr4.44 seen on Thursday.
Although the currency has been devalued by some 15 per cent against the
D-Mark since its link to the Ecu was broken on November 19, there is
speculation the krona may have further to fall.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Boeing wins Dollars 5bn order for its 767s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BOEING yesterday launched a programme to build an all-cargo version of its
767 twin engine wide-body aircraft after winning a Dollars 5bn (Pounds
3.2bn) order for 60 all-cargo 767s from United Parcel Service (UPS).
The Atlanta-based package delivery company has placed firm orders for 30 new
767 cargo aircraft and taken options on a further 30.
Boeing said it was the largest order for all-cargo aircraft it had ever
received. It comes as Boeing, like other manufacturers, is coming under
pressure from financially pressed airline customers to defer or cancel new
orders.
Detailed design engineering on the new cargo aircraft, based on the Boeing
767-300 extended range airframe, will begin immediately, with production
starting in the second quarter of next year, Boeing said.
The first 767 freighter will roll out of production and enter flight testing
in the second quarter of 1995 with delivery to UPS in October 1995.
The new cargo aircraft will be capable of carrying 56 tons of cargo over a
range of 3000 nautical miles or 45 tons as far as 4000 nautical miles.
UPS has not selected the engines for the aircraft.
Aircraft exports involving British Aerospace have won export credit
guarantees worth Dollars 106m, the Export Credit Guarantees Department,
Britain's official export credit insurer, said yesterday, David Dodwell
writes.
The guarantees have helped to ensure finance for the sale of nine aircraft
to five countries as part of the pan-European Airbus project. They concern
the lease of two A330-600R aircraft to Ansett Airlines of Australia, two
A310-300s to Tarom of Romania, and two A320s apiece to TransAsia of Taiwan
and Air Lanka. The purchase of an A320-200 by Tunis Air has also been
supported.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S state-owned industries have reacted much better than expected to
the tough market-oriented policies introduced three years ago. Their
performance strengthens hopes for resuming solidly-based economic growth, a
World Bank study concludes.
The study, which examines the experiences of 75 of the country's 8,000
state-owned companies, says 'success stories are emerging and the state
sector is far from a write-off'. The paper adds that 'good and bad
performers are emerging in all sectors', indicating Poland's potential to
build up a 'diversified manufacturing base'.
The study comes against the background of a 3.5 per cent rise in industrial
sales in 1992 and a slowdown in the rate of increase in unemployment,
announced yesterday by the government statistical office. Inflation also
declined last year to 43 per cent, from 60.4 per cent in 1991. The rise in
industrial sales reverses three years of steep decline.
Evidence that state-owned as well as private enterprises are contributing to
the turnaround indicates that 'recovery has a solid micro-economic
foundation and will therefore be sustained', the World Bank team headed by
Mr Brian Pinto said.
It noted that privatisation is taking longer than originally expected and
suggested that 'restructuring and clarifying managerial accountability and
rewards' in the state sector should be stressed.
It also recommends that privatisation decisions should be decentralised and
that management buyouts and hitherto neglected schemes to reward managers
who enhance the value of enterprises before privatisation should be
favoured.

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday failed to forge a necessary two-thirds
parliamentary majority in favour of changing the country's constitution to
allow German soldiers to take part in UN peace-keeping and peace-making
operations.
In an often stormy debate, the opposition Social Democrats made it clear
that they were not prepared to accept any use of the German Bundeswehr
(armed forces) beyond exclusively UN peace-keeping operations.
However, on a separate issue, the SPD agreed to a new formula to change the
constitution on the disputed question of limiting the existing liberal law
on political asylum, clearing the way for a deal next week.
On the question of military operations, the Social Democrats accused the
ruling coalition of seeking to turn the Bundeswehr into 'an army of
intervention', and of being tempted to indulge in 'gunboat diplomacy'.
In spite of a strong and direct appeal by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, for Germany to play its full role in future UN
operations, the opposition said the government was looking for a 'blank
cheque' to deploy its armed forces anywhere in the world.
The charges were strongly rejected by government speakers. Mr Volker Ruhe,
the minister of defence, said: 'Germany must take on the same responsibility
as its neighbours in a new and altered international system.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, said that a re-united and sovereign
Germany 'must face up to its responsibility in a changed world, without
limitations.
'We want and must in our own interests, and in the interest of the community
of nations, recreate the full capacity for action of the German federal
republic as a member of the United Nations.'
As for the proposal to allow operations in the context of other alliances,
such as Nato and the Western European Union, it required that any such
involvement of the Bundeswehr be approved by a two-thirds majority in
parliament. 'Could there be any greater brake on such an action?' he asked.
The opposition was unmoved. Mr Karsten Voigt, the foreign policy spokesman
for the SPD, said the proposal 'does not bring us one millimetre closer to a
parliamentary compromise'.
In addition, Mr Walter Kolbow, the defence spokesman, said that the
amendment tabled by the government 'is moving us in totally the wrong
direction'.

<TEXT>
THE self-styled parliament of the Bosnian Serbs is to meet on January 19 to
decide the fate of the constitutional proposals for Bosnia-Hercegovina
agreed at the Geneva peace conference this week, official Serb sources said
yesterday.
A Serb official in Pale, the rebels' main base in Bosnia, said the meeting
would take place there on Tuesday but the venue might still be subject to
change.
The European Community has given the Serbs until Tuesday to accept the
constitutional principles or face UN punitive action.
Meanwhile, Mr Cyrus Vance has 'no plans' to step down from his job as
co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Fred
Eckhard, his spokesman, said yesterday.
Mr Eckhard, commenting on a British report that Mr Vance was intending to
leave, said: 'We're working pretty much at fever pitch right now; there is
no question of his leaving the conference now.'
However, Mr Eckhard made clear that, at some unspecified time in the future,
Mr Vance, who is a senior partner in a New York law firm, would like to
divide his time more between New York and Geneva in order to continue
co-chairing the conference.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Swedish central bank sets target for inflation

SWEDEN'S central bank, the Riksbank, said yesterday price stability was its
'over-riding objective' as it set an inflation target of 2 per cent a year
for the economy from 1995.
This was the first specific policy statement from the bank since Sweden was
compelled to float the krona last November. It came a day after the bank
intervened in the markets to support the currency for the first time since
then.
For 1993 and 1994, the bank is aiming to hold underlying inflation to 2 per
cent, although actual inflation will rise to some 5 per cent this year,
following the depreciation of the krona and an increase in indirect taxes.
'Price increases in excess of 5 per cent cannot be tolerated,' said the
central bank.
It did not signal any reduction in its key marginal rate, which stands at
10.5 per cent, nor did it suggest any specific exchange rate targets.
The bank has set the inflation target to cover the time that the krona
continues to float, but wants a return to a fixed exchange rate when
conditions allow.
Yesterday's policy statement had little impact on the krona, which has
fallen victim to a new round of currency speculation since the New Year.
The Swedish currency was yesterday trading at around SKr4.45 to the D-Mark
in London, little changed from the SKr4.44 level seen on Thursday.
Although the currency has been devalued by some 15 per cent against the
D-Mark since its link to the Ecu was broken on November 19, there is
speculation the krona may have further to fall.
Mr Keith Edmonds, international economist at NatWest Markets in London, said
that the announcement of an official deficit forecast for the 1993/1994
fiscal year of SKr160bn, or 11 per cent of GDP, had raised concerns. 'There
is a possibility of another edge downwards after the sharp rise in
government borrowing,' he said.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Slow growth curbs price rises in Spain

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S inflation rate fell marginally in 1992 to 5.4 per cent, from 5.5 per
cent in 1991.
This was a considerable improvement on government forecasts early last year
of 6.4 per cent rise in the consumer price index by December.
Underlying inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and non-processed
food prices, rose by just 0.2 percentage points last month, the lowest
monthly rise of 1992, to give a rate for the year of 6.9 per cent.
The figures, published yesterday by the government's statistics institute,
reflected the depressed state of the domestic economy. Independent
economists estimate zero growth in the last quarter of last year and growth
of about 1 per cent overall in 1992.
Mr Jose Luis Feito, chief analyst of the Madrid securities firm of
Asesosores Bursatlies, said the downward trend in prices would continue in
coming months. There was unlikely to be any meaningful easing of interest
rates soon.
Lower inflation appears likely following a recommendation by the employers'
federation to hold salary increases this year below 3 per cent. The
government has already taken the lead on wage moderation by fixing the
increase of the minimum wage at just 4 per cent, the lowest annual increase
for a decade, and in effect freezing wage increases in the public sector.
The government's employment agency meanwhile reported that the number of
registered job seekers rose last month to 2.36m, up by 31,000 on December
1991.

FT  16 JAN 93 / Nato troops come under German law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and its North Atlantic Treaty allies which have troops stationed in
the country yesterday finalised a deal to bring them more directly under
German law.
The agreement deal is intended as an important symbolic gesture by the Nato
allies to remove any remaining suggestion that the troops are 'occupation
forces' in a defeated Germany. Although foreign troops have been broadly
subject to German law in recent years, this deal tightens loopholes
preventing them from operating above the law of the land.
It has been negotiated over the past 16 months, at Germany's request, after
Britain, France, the US and the former Soviet Union gave the go-ahead for
German unification in the so-called 'two-plus-four' agreement.
Some exemptions to German law are still provided for in the agreement, but
the basic principle is that it will generally apply to troops stationed in
the country, according to officials involved in the talks.
Sensitive areas in the negotiations included protection of the environment,
and the application of strict German labour laws to civilian employees of
the allied forces.
The German Lander, in particular, have been keen to tighten the rules
controlling military exercises in environmentally sensitive areas.
In a separate deal initialled yesterday, Britain, Canada and Germany agreed
to terminate the treaty which allows training exercises on the Luneburg
heath near Hanover.
Environmentalists have been campaigning to stop destructive tank training
exercises there, and they will now cease from July 31 1994, officials said.

OVER 1,500 journalists and staff have been sacked from Serbian radio and TV

following the victory of extremist nationalist forces in last month's
Serbian elections, writes Anthony Robinson.
'We are angered that the victorious party, personified in Milorad Vucelic,
the head of Serbian radio and TV, has declared open warfare against its
political opponents in the media before it has even resumed power,' the
union said.
'The expulsions will be just a prelude to a country-wide persecution unless
the people behind the purge are stopped,' added a statement by the
opposition Serbian Renaissance Movement. 'Lists of desireable and
undesirable citizens have been compiled in all enterprises and

FT  16 JAN 93 / Inflation falls to 2.6% but underlying rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG CUTS in mortgage interest rates pushed down UK retail price inflation -
the so-called headline rate - to 2.6 per cent last month, the lowest level
for 6 1/2 years.
But the Treasury's chosen measure of underlying inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, crept back up.
Higher seasonal food and petrol prices were the main factors behind the rise
in the annual rate of underlying inflation last month. Prices rose by 3.7
per cent in the year to December compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to
November. This was the first rise in the annual rate since March last year.
The latest rise leaves the underlying inflation rate near the upper end of
its target range. Last autumn Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the
government aimed to keep this measure within a 1-4 per cent range, and bring
it down to 2 per cent before the end of this parliament.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday he was
confident the headline rate - down from 3 per cent in November - would fall
further this month.
He described the rise in underlying inflation as 'very marginal' and said it
was well within its parameters. The government was 'absolutely determined'
it remained so, he said.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'While headline inflation has
fallen because of the recession, the underlying rate is rising and is
heading towards the upper end of the government's target range.'
Most economists expect the headline rate of inflation to continue falling
this year as further interest rate cuts affect the index, but they are less
sure about the direction of the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments.
Earlier this week figures for producer prices showed that sterling's
devaluation has pushed up the prices of raw materials and fuels.
Manufacturers' output prices have also risen slightly, but so far they have
resisted passing on the higher costs to retailers.
Mr Robert Lind, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the investment house,
believes the Treasury's underlying measure will rise above 4 per cent
because of the effects of devaluation.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at the investment house Greenwell Montagu,
said: 'Our measure of core inflation, which measures only the prices of
goods and services that you buy in shops, fell again this month. We consider
this to be indicative of what is really going on with inflation in the
economy.'
Apart from the big rise in seasonal food prices - 4 per cent on the month -
Central Statistical Office figures showed a sharp rise in the price of
tobacco as manufacturers' price increases continued to feed through to the
index. Prices rose by 1.6 per cent on the month and 9.1 per cent on the
year. Price reductions were concentrated in alcohol, cars, clothing and
footwear.

ultimatum. This insisted it give immediate clearance for UN weapons
inspectors to fly into the country.
The rejection came two days after a raid by allied aircraft on missile sites
in the air exclusion zone in southern Iraq.
Shortly before a 9pm GMT deadline expired yesterday, Mr Nizar Hamdoon,
Iraq's UN representative, said his country had agreed to allow the UN to go
ahead with its flights, but could not guarantee their safety in the event of
another military attack by the US-led coalition. In Baghdad, a government
spokesman said the UN aircraft would be allowed to fly in Iraqi airspace on
January 15-18.
The special UN commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's dangerous weapons
said it viewed Baghdad's response as a 'refusal' because it abdicated Iraq's
'obligation for ensuring the safety and security of UN special commission
personnel'.
US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said that Iraq's response was
'wishy-washy'. He added: 'I think the president's made it clear that if
Saddam Hussein doesn't step up to the plate and deal with the situation the
way he really wants, why, Saddam may be in some more trouble.'
The commission appeared to give Iraq a second chance when it said it was
sending Baghdad a new set of flight plans shortly in the hope it would not
'couch' its reply in the same manner. The commission said the earliest
sensible date for a resumption of UN flights would be on Sunday morning.
These remarks prompted speculation that military action had been put on
hold. But early this morning the White House said it was still reviewing the
situation.
Diplomats in the allied coalition meeting in New York and US officials both
indicated that Mr Hamdoon's promise fell short of the unconditional
compliance with UN resolutions they were seeking.
They also said yesterday's Baghdad statement made no reference to the allied
demand for the removal of Iraqi police posts from Kuwaiti territory.
President Bush declined to spell out what action might follow if Iraq did
not comply with the ultimatum. 'Sufficient warnings have been given. They
know what they must do,' Mr Bush said.
'This is not just the US, it's the United Nations. It is a strong coalition
whose determination has not diminished in any single way.'
Iraq claimed yesterday its air defences had chased off a military aircraft
from the southern no-fly zone. It warned the allies that anti-aircraft units
had been alerted to confront any more 'hostile activity'.
'The US administration has given Iraq only one choice, that is the choice to
go to war,' said the government newspaper al-Jumhouriyah.
The US said it could not confirm another Iraqi claim that its anti-aircraft
batteries had fired on a 'hostile air target' in the south of the country.
The latest US ultimatum was issued shortly after more than 300 troops from
the US Army 1st Cavalry flew into Kuwait from Fort Hood in Texas. A further
two jets were due in the night. US officials expect the full complement of
about 1,100 troops to be in place by tonight.
They comprise a reinforced brigade of two M1A1 battle tank companies, an
infantry company and an artillery battery. Officials stressed that the
troops would not be used to police Kuwait's border with Iraq.
The fresh deployment will bring to about 1,700 the number of US military
personnel in Kuwait.

THE Clinton administration will inherit the best inflation outlook for a
generation, according to figures released yesterday, writes Michael Prowse
in Washington.
Data on production and exports, however, confirmed that the pace of recovery
is likely to remain subdued.
Consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.9 per cent in the year
to December. With the exception of a temporary dip in inflation below 2 per
cent in 1986, this was the lowest annual increase since the mid-1960s.

FT  16 JAN 93 / NatWest rules out general pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, one of the largest white collar employers in
Britain, yesterday signalled a tough 1993 pay round by telling its 80,000
staff that it could not afford to offer an across-the-board pay rise.
NatWest, which is among the most influential setters of pay trends in the UK
labour market, said staff would only receive performance-related pay rises.
These will vary between 3 per cent and 6 per cent for most staff, with a
minority getting no rise.
The NatWest offer is the first in the banking pay round and may be followed
by other low offers from high street banks, which are trying to restrain
costs. Barclays Bank, which could declare a loss for 1992 in March, meets
unions next week.
The pay offer, which was strongly criticised by unions, indicates that signs
of recovery in the economy are unlikely to be reflected in higher pay rises
in the spring pay round. NatWest's pay settlement date is in April.
Further signs of pressures on pay emerged in a telephone survey conducted by
the Financial Times yesterday, which found that more than 20,000 employees
of recession-hit construction companies have had earnings frozen.
Mr Mike Goodswen, NatWest's director of human resources, said the bank had
decided not to make an across-the-board pay increase because of internal
cost pressures and because the state of the labour market did not require
it.
He said the move did not constitute a pay freeze, as some union leaders
yesterday described it. 'That is part of the old mentality,' he said.
He estimated that NatWest's pay bill would rise by at least 3 per cent.
The bank said it would compensate for the lack of a general increase by
raising performance-related pay increments by between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent.
Increments for non-managers are split into three bands: satisfactory, good
and outstanding.
Staff who are judged satisfactory and are not at the top of pay bands will
receive between 4.5 and 6 per cent, as opposed to between 4 and 5 per cent.
Those graded outstanding may receive up to 7.5 per cent.
The NatWest Staff Association, which represents about half the bank's staff,
said employees were not being rewarded for their contribution to expected
increased profits in this financial year.
Mr Dai Davies, NWSA assistant general secretary, said staff faced 'continual
pressures to achieve sales in the face of severe customer criticism' as well
as the fear of compulsory redundancy and the erosion of fringe benefits.
Mr Alan Ainsworth, chief negotiator for the Bifu financial services union,
said the bank's 'arrogant disregard for staff feelings' was unbelievable. He
said about 5,500 jobs had been cut in NatWest last year with more likely.
The number of UK pay freezes has been rising recently. The Engineering
Employers Federation estimates 13 per cent of settlements in engineering
involve wage freezes.
The Confederation of British Industry revealed one manufacturing group in
three had introduced a freeze since the beginning of the bargaining period
last August. The most prominent freezes include:
A six-month wage freeze for Rover Group employees from November as part of a
two-year pay deal which includes a 3.6 per cent rise this May and 3.6 per
cent from November.
A freeze on basic rates for manual workers at Calor Gas, the gas production,
distribution and retailing company.
A 12-month freeze for all 3,500 employees at Swan Hunter shipyard followed
by an inflation-linked pay rise.

<TEXT>
The second fire in less than two days broke out yesterday at the Chernobyl
power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident, writes Chrystia
Freeland in Kiev.
The fire was in a ventilation corridor on top of the sarcophagus which
covers the melted-down reactor core left by the 1986 accident. The location
is considered the most radioactive site at the power plant.
Chernobyl officals said no radiation was released, but admitted it could
have been, had not the fire been put out quickly. The first and third blocks
of the power plant remain in operation.
'Although no radiation was released this is a serious moral blow,' said Mr
Anatoli Demianenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian Atomic Energy Safety
Commission. 'A fire the day before yesterday, then a fire today - together,
these are morally troubling events.' He said a recent inspection at
Chernobyl had uncovered serious safety violations in the construction and
maintenance of the sarcophagus.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Haitian avalanche 'ready to fall on US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPECTED 'massive influx' of Haitians may be one of the first foreign
policy crises President-elect Bill Clinton has to face, Mr Dick Cheney,
defence secretary, said yesterday, AP reports.
'The evidence is there that thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of
Haitians are in fact preparing to descend upon Florida' as soon as Mr
Clinton takes office, Mr Cheney said.
Meanwhile, Haiti's deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is urging his
country's military-backed government to accept a large force of
international observers to restore order in the Caribbean nation and prevent
a mass exodus.
US officials said on Wednesday that Mr Aristide was sending a letter to
Haiti's rulers in an attempt to break the logjam in international efforts to
restore the democratically elected president to power.
Aides to Mr Aristide said the letter - written under pressure from the Bush
administration and Clinton associates - would be conveyed to the heads of
the Organisation of American States and of the United Nations.
The OAS will send an emissary with the letter to Haiti's government in
Port-au-Prince, said Mr Michael Barnes, a former congressman and now council
to Mr Aristide.
Mr Barnes said the letter would call for the immediate dispatch of hundreds
of UN and OAS observers to oversee the restoration of order and civil
rights. It would also call for Haiti's parliament to approve an interim
prime minister who would work for Mr Aristide's return.
Once parliament approved the interim prime minister, the US and its allies
would lift the trade embargo they imposed on Haiti after Mr Aristide was
ousted by a military coup in September 1991.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state-designate, said at his
confirmation hearing on Wednesday that the intensive efforts to bring about
an agreement in Haiti 'are quite promising this week'.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Fourth-quarter fall at J P Morgan
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the blue-chip New York banking group, was hurt in the fourth
quarter by a decline in trading revenues caused by losses on mortgage-backed
securities.
Although the bank has consistently turned in results that are above the
industry average over the past year - and yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent
rise in its 1992 full-year net profits to Dollars 1.38bn - the fall in
fourth-quarter trading income triggered a drop in Morgan's share price on
Wall Street.
The share price fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 62 yesterday morning after
the bank said its fourth-quarter trading result was Dollars 200m, sharply
lower than the Dollars 313m recorded in the third quarter of 1992 and below
the Dollars 245m achieved in the last quarter of 1991.
The losses in mortgage-backed securities trading also affected trading
revenues for the whole of 1992, which were Dollars 959m, down from Dollars
1.297bn the year before.
Overall net profits for the fourth quarter of 1992 rose by 11 per cent
year-on-year to Dollars 298m, well below market expectations. This
translates into earnings per share of Dollars 1.48 in the quarter, 13 cents
higher year-on-year.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, said the bank's performance last year was
helped especially by corporate finance and securities underwriting
contributions. JP Morgan is one of the few US banks allowed by authorities
to enter the equities market.
Sir Dennis said there was also steady profits growth in credit-related,
investment management and operational service divisions of JP Morgan.
Earnings per share for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 6.92, compared with
Dollars 5.80 in 1991. Bad debt provisions for 1992 were just Dollars 55m, up
from Dollars 40m the year before but extremely low for a big US bank.
Return on equity was high at 22 per cent for the year and 18 per cent for
the fourth quarter. JP Morgan also added Dollars 1bn during the year to its
net equity base, which totalled Dollars 7.1bn at the end of the year.
Net interest revenues for 1992 were 15 per cent up at Dollars 224m while
corporate finance revenues rose by 32 per cent last year to Dollars 439m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian contractor likely for
Siberian copper project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S BIGGEST copper deposit, at Udokan in eastern Siberia, is expected
to be awarded on Monday to a group of Russian enterprises as part of the
government's attempts to help its ailing industrial plants find new
business.
Only two companies finally submitted proposals in an international tender to
draw up a feasibility study for the project after six large western mining
companies dropped out of the race citing either a lack of time to prepare
properly or complaining about the content of the copper.
The two remaining contenders were Australia's BHP and the Udokan Mining
Company, which is considered the Russian participant in spite of being
half-owned by two little known foreign companies.
UMC is backed by a group of Russian industrial plants which want to provide
the equipment for the Dollars 1bn development. It is almost certain to win,
given the Russian government's desire to help factories switch from military
production to civilan output and a market system.
UMC's lack of experience of a big mining project is being compensated for by
advice from Fluor Daniel, the San Francisco-based mining consultancy, which
has already submitted a detailed feasibility study for the project.
Under Fluor Daniel's proposals, the project would be financed through a
combination of fund-raising by a New York investment bank, copper
concentrate sales to China, and export credit guarantees to finance imports
of machinery from the West.
Under the terms of a tentative contract, UMC has arranged to sell 200,000
tonnes of concentrate from the mine, once it comes on stream around 1997, to
China's National Non-Ferrous Metals Company. Under the 25-year agreement,
China, which is connected to Udokan by the Baikul-Amur Railway, would in
turn dispatch the concentrate to smelters which it will build specially to
cope with the concentrate's high sulphur content. The resulting copper would
then be used within China or re-exported.
In keeping with UMC's original purpose, the bulk of equipment to build the
mine and accompanying infrastructure is to be produced by more than a dozen
Russian companies plus Belaz, the Belorussian vehicles producer, all grouped
in a consortium led by Uralmash, the Urals heavy engineering plant.
The tender committee was due to produce its recommendations on the competing
proposals today, leaving the final decision to be taken by the Russian
president and government. The winner is expected to be announced on Monday.

<TEXT>
HILTON Hotels, the California-based lodging and gaming company, yesterday
reported a 23 per cent improvement in after-tax profits during 1992, to
Dollars 103.9m. The advance was largely due to better results from the
casino side, with the hotels turning in a flat performance.
Overall, the company posted operating profits of Dollars 219.9m for the
year, a 19 per cent improvement. Within this, however, the gaming division -
boosted by the purchase of the Reno Hilton at the end of July - made Dollars
153.4m, up from Dollars 115m, while the hotels side posted operating profits
of Dollars 91.5m, slightly lower than the previous year's Dollars 92.9m.
Total revenues were Dollars 1.23bn, an 11 per cent advance.
During the fourth quarter, net profits were Dollars 26.5m, down from Dollars
29.6m in the same period of 1991. Operating profits were marginally higher
at Dollars 56.4m, but although the gaming division showed a 33 per cent
operating profit improvement, the hotels slipped by 6 per cent.
Yesterday, Hilton said it continued to see 'weak conditions in certain key
markets', on the hotel front, and average room rates were lower than in 1991
'due to competitive conditions'.
Hotel occupancy for 1992, however, increased to 66 per cent - a couple of
percentage points higher than in 1991.
On the gaming side, the company was much more optimistic.
The Nevada property saw occupancy rise from 85 per cent to 87 per cent, with
an increase from 81 to 86 per cent in the final quarter.
Hilton said it planned to spend Dollars 246m on expansion and renovation of
properties in Nevada during the next two years and estimated the cost of its
gaming riverboat venture in Kansas City - which is still subject to approval
by local residents - at Dollars 75m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files shelf
registration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered
a fresh indication of its determination to reduce its debt burden when it
said it had filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to raise as much as Dollars 2bn.
Although such shelf registrations are commonplace among US companies, Time
Warner said that the net proceeds from the sale of up to Dollars 2bn of debt
securities - to be sold from time to time depending on market conditions -
would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock or bank debt.
In particular, the company said some of the proceeds might be used to
repurchase or redeem its Dollars 6.5bn of Series C or Series D preferred
stock. The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in
dividend payments, was issued as a result of the 1989 merger agreement
between Time and Warner.
Yesterday's shelf registration came just a week after Time Warner launched a
fully underwritten Dollars 1bn debenture issue also aimed at reducing its
preferred stock.
That move followed the company's recent statements that it could sell up to
Dollars 3bn of non-strategic assets over the next couple of years to lower

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nissan and Mazda in supply deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN and Mazda, two of Japan's leading carmakers, have agreed to provide
each other with small vans and light trucks in a significant step towards
the consolidation of the hard-pressed Japanese motor industry.
Under the deal, Nissan is likely to suspend production of some of its light
commercial vehicles and instead sell trucks supplied by Mazda. Mazda will
streamline its range of vans by being supplied by Nissan.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said the alliance was designed to
improve profitability by reducing development costs.
The partnership is the latest sign of the pressure Japan's vehicle makers
are under to cut costs in response to sharp falls in profits over the past
two years.
It follows a similar deal announced last month between Isuzu and Honda.
Isuzu will supply Honda with its Rodeo recreational vehicle, plugging an
important gap in Honda's product range. Honda will supply Isuzu with small
passenger cars. Isuzu is pulling out of passenger car production.
The pressure for consolidation among the weaker producers in the Japanese
car industry, which is struggling beneath a burden of excess production
capacity, marks a sharp change of fortune.
Until about 18 months ago, the Japanese producers were confidently expanding
across the world and widening their product ranges. In the past year, cuts
in capital investment have become widespread, companies are lengthening the
gap between model changes and pulling in their horns internationally.
Analysts believe the current downturn may usher in an era of slow growth in
car demand which will make it increasingly difficult for Japan to support
nine fiercely competitive car producers.
The Japanese industry is separating into two groups. Companies such as
Toyota, the leading producer, Mitsubishi and Suzuki are weathering the
downturn in relatively sound financial health.
However producers such as Nissan, Mazda and Honda have been badly hit by
declining sales just as they are shouldering the financial burden of heavy
investments they made in the late 1980s.
Mr Koji Endo, analyst at S. G. Warburg securities said: 'No Japanese maker
other than Toyota has the resources to sustain a comprehensive product
range. This deal is the first step towards a wider partnership and other
companies will have to follow, targeting their resources at specific
segments of the market.'
Nissan reported a loss in the six months to the end of last September of
Y14.24bn (Dollars 113m) largely because it has been losing market share in
Japan's declining market. Nissan's sales in Japan last year fell by 20 per
cent to 546,778 units and its market share fell by 1.2 per cent to 22 per
cent.
Mazda reported a 73 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of
the year to Y3bn.

FT  15 JAN 93 / CBS buys some expensive chat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID LETTERMAN, a 45-year-old comedian and chat show host from
Indianapolis, was last night set to be poached from NBC by CBS Television
for a salary of about Dollars 14m (Pounds 9.2m) a year, making him the
world's best-paid chat show host. For CBS, the network controlled by Mr
Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor, hiring Mr Letterman would be a
potentially profitable coup.
Both networks were scrambling yesterday to arrange press conferences, with
NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric, planning to announce in Los Angeles
that it had decided not to match the CBS offer.
Mr Letterman, an articulate showman who hosts an offbeat chat show starting
at 12.30am, has been unhappy since he lost the chance last spring to take
over the Tonight Show when Johnny Carson, host of show for decades, retired.
Instead of Mr Letterman, NBC named Jay Leno, a square-jawed comedian who has
been panned by many critics, to host the Tonight Show, which is broadcast
for an hour from 11.30 in the evening. That put Mr Leno up against ABC's
Nightline with Ted Koppel, the influential current affairs programme. CBS
was only able to offer mysteries and movies in this important time slot.
By moving from NBC to CBS Mr Letterman would not only fulfil his ambitions
by launching a programme in the 11.30 slot and competing directly with the
Tonight Show, but he would also double his salary. His negotiations have
been handled by Mr Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency (CAA),
the Hollywood talent agency that is the most powerful in the US.
NBC's management has been criticised for a sharp decline in audience ratings
over the past two years. General Electric is believed to be interested in
selling the network provided it can obtain the right price; among those
interested is a consortium headed by Bill Cosby, the comedian.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: BOC sounds warning over UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases group, yesterday warned the UK economy was 'dead
in the water'.
Growth would be very low during the year, the group believed.
Sales of the group's gases are a sensitive barometer of industrial activity.
Speaking to shareholders at the annual meeting, Mr Patrick Rich, chairman
and chief executive, added that it was too early to assess the impact of the
change in economic policy following the devaluation of sterling last
September.
The group's first quarter would be reasonably strong compared with last
year, but he warned continued improvement would be dependent upon currencies
and recovery of the world economy.
Mr Rich said the weakness of sterling - which helps the group through
translation benefits - and continued cost containment would enable the group
to continue to sustain its results.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, received a non-committal
response yesterday from the European Commission to his outline proposals for
supporting the UK coal industry.
Mr Heseltine met Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition commissioner, and
Mr Abel Matutes, who has taken over responsibility for energy and transport,
for general discussions about EC and UK policy.
As expected, neither commissioner was able to comment in detail on the UK
suggestions, which have not yet been adopted by the British cabinet. Mr
Heseltine wants to ease the pressure on the British industry, and has
considered the imposition of a system of levies on consumers' electricity
bills. That would amount to an indirect subsidy that would allow generators
to buy British coal.
An official for Mr Matutes said that the commissioner would study Mr
Heseltine's plans, but it was too early to say what reaction the commission
might have. British diplomats said Mr Heseltine had not come to Brussels
expecting a firm response from the new commissioners.

FT  15 JAN 93 / People: Watkins turns up at Binatone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gulu Lalvani, multi-millionaire Asian entrepreneur, founder of
privately-owned Binatone, the consumer electronics group, and the man who
gave Alan Sugar his first break in 1966, has now poached one of the Amstrad
chairman's key aides.
This week Amstrad announced the resignation of Robert Watkins, technical
director, in a terse statement. Now, less than 24-hours later, it emerges
that Watkins, who has been Amstrad's technical and manufacturing director
since April 1983 and was the second highest paid director after Sugar
himself, is to be Binatone's new group managing director.
Watkins, who joined Amstrad in 1976, is credited with helping develop many
of Amstrad's 'blockbuster' products which fuelled the group's phenomenal
success in the 1980s when turnover peaked at over Pounds 600m.
At Binatone he will be responsible for UK and Hong Kong operations,
reporting directly to the chairman.
Yesterday Lalvani, a marketing wiz who has built Binatone into a Pounds
80m-a-year group now headquartered in Hong Kong, said: 'Bob's appointment
will help accelerate Binatone's global expansion by maintaining our
innovative edge and making our quality electronics products available to
consumers worldwide.'
The appointment appears to be a significant coup for Lalvani who has
sometimes been described as Alan Sugar's mentor, but who looks increasingly
like challenging Amstrad head on in the European consumer electronics
market.
Binatone has already toppled BT's dominant position in the booming telephone
answering machine market in the UK. It also recently bought a significant
share in Germany's Loewe Betacom joint venture - previously owned by
Amstrad's Betacom subsid-iary.
The old friendship between Lalvani and Sugar may therefore be becoming a
little strained, although the two are still dining partners when the
Binatone chairman is in town. Indeed Lalvani warned Sugar over dinner in
November that his 30p-a-share buy-back bid for Amstrad would fail - and it
did.

FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that United Biscuits may be experiencing hunger pangs for a Spanish
cookie company has unsettled the UK company's shares, if somewhat
prematurely. UB stresses its interest in buying the biscuits business of
Royal Brands is preliminary. Besides, UB appears well aware of the market's
fears about it over-stretching itself following acquisitions in Australia
and the US. It promises not to do anything to jeopardise its steady
rehabilitation with disappointed shareholders.
Nevertheless, UB must be tempted to have a nibble. Royal Brands is an
attractive business. Its biscuits arm, which accounts for 40 per cent of
sales, may be worth Pounds 100m. In better circumstances, this would hardly
be a lot of money for UB. It may, however, prove heavy enough with the
company's gearing standing at more than 80 per cent.
The suspicion is that Royal Brands' owner, Tabacalera, is trying to entice
UB into an auction with RJR Nabisco. It claims the US company has already
made a firm offer for half the business. This would be a dangerous game for
UB. What Nabisco is playing around at is baffling. After disposing of its
European food business following its enormous leveraged buy-out in 1988,
Nabisco now appears to be trying to build it all back up again. At least it
can claim some familiarity with Royal Brands' biscuits division. It sold it
to Tabacalera.

year by 6.4 per cent over 1991 to Pta42.2bn (Dollars 366m).
This comes after putting aside Pta34bn for bad debts, a 107 per cent
increase on the 1991 provision for non-performing loans.
One of the most aggressive of the domestic savings banks, as well as the
biggest, La Caixa has diversified in recent years to offer a full range of
financial services, including commercial banking.
Last year, it signed an ambitious joint venture agreement with the
Dutch-Belgian group Fortis aimed at securing a leading position in the

<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace company, yesterday revealed
its turnover and orders rose slightly in 1992, but markets remained tough
and were unlikely to improve in 1993, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Louis Gallois, chairman, said sales rose to about FFr51bn (Dollars
9.44bn) from FFr48.6bn in 1991.
Aerospatiale booked orders worth about FFr39bn in 1992, bringing its order
book to FFr149bn at the end of 1992, representing three years' work. In 1991
it booked FFr38bn in orders, and its end-1991 order book represented 2.6
years' work.
Mr Gallois declined to comment on 1992 earnings, saying he would not discuss
these before the company's board had approved them.
'If I were much richer, I'd be much happier,' Mr Gallois said. At the end of
1992 Aerospatiale had debts of FFr16.5bn against FFr14bn a year earlier, he
said.
The company received a shot in the arm last year from the decision by Credit
Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, to buy a 20 per cent stake in it,
which took effect on January 1, 1993.
In addition to the possibility of acquisitions, Mr Gallois said his company
could seek further alliances or deepen existing links.

THYSSEN INDUSTRIES, the engineering arm of West Germany's biggest steel and

The group, which produces components for the transport and energy sector,

its elevators, transport technology and maritime innovation divisions. But
losses continued to plague its engineering group, which is suffering from
the recession trends on the car industry.
But Mr Eckhard Rohkamm, board chairman, said losses in the engineering
divisions had been halved over the previous year and now stood 'under

which also owns Thyssen Stahl, the loss-making steel operations, compared
with DM52.1m previously.

VITAL FORSIKRING, one of Norway's top three insurers, has won domestic
corporate pension scheme business in 1992 worth additional funds of a net
NKr1.16bn (Dollars 166m) and annual premium income of NKr100m.
Gross new business last year reached an estimated NKr1.3bn, providing annual
premium income of NKr115m.
Analysts said that following last year's collapse of UNI Storebrand into the
hands of government-appointed administrators, a number of domestic insurers
had acquired some of UNI's business.
Vital said it suffered a net outflow of reserves and funds totalling NKr70m,
representing a NKr8m reduction in annual premiums.
Vital Pekon, a subsidiary which administers pension schemes, had agreements
with 25 funds, 13 secured last year, with NKr6bn of premiums and reserves
under management and annual premiums of NKr600m.
UNI Storebrand lost an estimated NKr225m in annual premium payments in 1992
on pension schemes covering NKr2.8bn, while Gjensidige, also among the top
five insurers, lifted annual premium income last year by NKr100m.

is split into separate Czech and Slovak crowns later this year, appear to
have encouraged many Slovaks to make the short journey to Vienna to change
as much money as possible. Uncertainty about the future about the two
countries' currencies has also fuelled foreign bankers' fears that they
could be left with worthless banknotes.
The old Czechoslovak crown is expected to be replaced with separate Czech
and Slovak crowns by June, though currency dealers say the split could come
much sooner. The Czech and Slovak central banks have both begun to stamp
existing banknotes with their own emblem to prepare for the split, causing a
rush to banks by anxious savers eager to deposit and safeguard their cash.
Some bankers believe that the stamping of banknotes will inevitably lead to
separate exchange rates even before the common currency is formally
abolished.
'We don't know what will happen, and we have to be cautious. Once the
currencies are stamped, the unstamped notes could become invalid; then we
could be left sitting on a worthless mountain of paper,' said a senior
Austrian banker.
Meanwhile, strong demand for foreign currency from Czech commercial banks
has already drained more than one third of the Czech central bank's foreign
currency reserves since the start of the year.
The central bank is obliged to sell foreign currency to the banks if they
require it to cover liabilities.
Since January 1, the central bank has sold almost Dollars 300m from its
estimated Dollars 700m foreign currency reserves.
Mr Martin Svehla, the Czech central bank spokesman, cautioned against
over-dramatising the situation. He said it was 'normal' for the time of the
month and year when companies make large payments.

FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Results give lift to TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED operating results for TSB and a return to profits at the pre-tax
level gave cheer to the market. The shares rose 9 1/2 to 156p and were the
most heavily traded of the day with more than 17m dealt. However, many
analysts were not convinced and one described the results as 'appalling
figures'.
Mr Michael Lever of Smith New Court, historically a leading bear on the
stock, said: 'The bottom line is that the profits before bad debt provisions
were better than expected.' However, he added: 'They have presented the
figures in a light which shows operating profits more generously than I
would.' The bank has long been seen as a takeover target and that sentiment
was also behind the share price strength yesterday.
The bank returned to profits in 1992, with a result of Pounds 43m after a
Pounds 597m charge for bad debts. This compared with last year's Pounds 47m
loss. However, several banking experts argued that taking a Pounds 38m
expenses charge below the line flattered the expenses figure, while the
recovery was partly fuelled by a Pounds 22m gilts sale. NatWest Securities
cut its forecast for 1993 by Pounds 60m to Pounds 190m.
UB rights fears
Rights issue fears swirled around United Biscuits after the Spanish food
group Tabacalera was reported as saying that the UK company was interested
in one of its subsidiaries, Grupo Royal Brands. The story, which appeared
yesterday in the Spanish press, caused some consternation among London
analysts anxious about the highly geared UB committing itself to a purchase
in the region of Pounds 200m.
However, UB was yesterday downplaying the reports and analysts later
suggested that Tabacalera may be trying to initiate an auction, having
already been offered a reported Esp17bn for a 50 per cent stake in Royal
Brands by Nabisco.
French group BSN is also said to have been approached by Tabacalera. While
UB may only be sizing up Royal Brands' biscuit operations, analysts remained
cautious about any further financial commitment from the group.
Last week it bought the snack food interests of CCA Group in Australia for
Pounds 47m, and paid Pounds 195.5m in November for the Bake-Line cookie
group in the US. The latter deal was funded with an Pounds 80m share issue.
Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'UB already has enough balls in the air, and
with 90 per cent gearing it is not an easy juggling act.' UB declined 9 to
359p.
US selling hits BP
Oil issues were weak, reacting to continuing pressure on crude oil prices.
BP was further affected by forecast downgrades. Dealers said US investment
bank Goldman Sachs and UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson had both followed
the lead taken by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Also, Strauss Turnbull's Mr
John Toalster, a BP super bear, sent out an oil review which argued that
prices would remain under pressure in 1993. He added that there was up to
60p of downside in BP's share price.
Mr Toalster said there was sizeable US selling but it was too early to
pinpoint a full-scale change of heart among US investors, who are
traditionally keen on BP.
The shares fell 5 to 232 1/2 p. Enterprise Oil declined 4 to 405p. Shell
Transport and Lasmo failed to benefit from the market strength, remaining
unchanged at 529p and 146p respectively.
Big turnover in MFI
A large seller in MFI Furniture sent the shares falling and took turnover to
15m, prompting some nervous speculation over the group's results due at the
end of the month. Smith New Court was said to have sold a block of 3m at
130p, with blocks of 2.7m at 131p and 1.7m at 131 1/2 p also being recorded
on the Seaq ticker.
MFI came to the market in July at 115p and had been a strong performer in
December. However, recent talk that the revival in retail sales may be
patchy, including the Boots warning over its DIY business, may have
contributed to one investor's decision to take profits and jump ship. The
shares closed 3 adrift at 132p.
Bear raiders were out in force on Allied-Lyons as talk circulated that the
drinks group would make a rights issue to fund an acquisition. This was
followed by another rumour that the company would be shortly making a
negative trading statement. Both were dismissed by analysts but not before
the shares were sent into retreat, although they later rallied to close just
a penny off at 605p. Turnover was an above-average 3.4m.
Full-year results from Rank Organisation came in at the lower end of
expectations and did nothing to dispel the caution surrounding the group's
shares. The company said it expected flat UK sales, although trading in the
US was picking up and this cheered some in the market. However, weak trading
is expected from Xerox, Rank's part-owned subsidiary, and was the main
factor in most analysts reducing their forecasts to a range of Pounds
250-Pounds 280m.
The shares fell 9 to 695p. Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities were advising
clients to switch into Thorn EMI, 9 better at 858p, with NatWest also
preferring Ladbroke, ahead a penny at 189p.
ICI recovered with some help from an upgrade by US stockbroker Paine Webber.
The house analyst said he had a 'high level of confidence' that ICI's board
would approve the spin-off of its Zeneca drug company, which would allow
management to cut out 'unnecessary layers of costs.' ICI shares lifted 20 to
1093p.
Industrial gases and healthcare group BOC were 16 higher in early trading
following a recommendation by NatWest Securities ahead of the company's
annual meeting. However, there was no significant good news at the meeting
and the rise was trimmed to a net gain of 8 at 746p.
Glaxo fell 10 to 714p as some technical analysts argued that the shares
should head lower after breaking below support at 750p last week. Analysts
project losses down to about 675p initially, with medium-term risk down to
637 to 624 pence.
Wellcome was 27 up at one stage helped by a large buy order. There was also
talk of an imminent article that would be positive for the drug group, but
no details developed and the shares ticked back to close 13 higher at 924p.
Royal Insurance fell a penny to 277p as US credit rating agency Standard &amp;
Poor's lowered its claims paying ability on Royal. S&amp;P believes Royal's
operating performance will remain weak in the short term due to mortgage
indemnity losses and mediocre results at subsidiaries.
Reports that British Aerospace would soon sign a joint venture deal with
Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture and develop regional aircraft led to strong
demand for the stock. The shares jumped 7 to 177p, in trade of 3.5m.
Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite who made it his 'stock of the year'
said: 'The joint venture will stem the black hole in regional aircraft
activities and enable the company to redevelop some of the provisions
elsewhere.
The clashes in the Gulf led to demand for several defence related stocks,
including Rolls-Royce which bounced 4 to 110p, while Vosper Thornycroft
added 7 to 475p. Good buying from a regional broker helped boost Alvis and
the shares firmed 4 to 23p.
Plans to raise prices at British Steel saw the shares add 2 to 60p, with
volume reaching 6.8m. A squeeze in Johnson Group caused the shares to jump
35 to 734p.
In motors, profit-taking at GKN left the shares 7 lighter at 458p, but yield
buyers were seen in T and N where the shares gained 5 to 173p.
Bid speculation returned to Gestetner sending the shares climbing 10 to
152p.
There was renewed strong support for Treatt, the USM-quoted aromatic oils
manufacturer which announced an 8 per cent jump in preliminary profits
earlier this week, with the shares closing a further 10 higher at 128p.

FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF a cut in base rates brought a sharp advance in stock index futures,
although a downturn on Wall Street saw some of the gain surrendered late in
the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Traders expected a good day when the March contract on the FT-SE opened 23
points above Wednesday's close at 2,786. After a temporary dip to 2,776,
hopes of a rate cut led to strong demand for the contract and also helped to
pull the underlying cash market higher.
Sentiment in the futures was further boosted by good activity in short
sterling, and the day's high of 2,798 was reached at around 2.30pm.
The turnround in New York after initial firmness led to a reversal in the
fortunes of March, and it drifted lower for the rest of the session as
profit-takers cashed in on early gains.
March closed at 2,785, up 22 from its previous close and around 11 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Turnover was a reasonable 8,503
contracts.
Volume in the traded options returned to more modest levels, reaching 26,312
lots. The FT-SE 100 option, which expires today, was the main attraction. It
had a total of 11,770 contracts traded, although there was little interest
in the Euro FT-SE option, which saw a mere 737 lots change hands. TSB was
the busiest stock option with a total of 986 lots dealt.

FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes trigger market rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD speculation around the markets of an imminent cut in UK interest
rates, possibly after news of inflation numbers for December is announced
this morning, led to a good rally in London's equity market.
It was additionally helped by the streadfast response of international
markets to the allied strike against Iraq. Rumours of the latest military
move swept London's dealing rooms on Wednesday, causing widespread unease
throughout most European markets.
Dealers conceded, however, that the UK equity market, which has fallen well
over 100 points in seven consecutive trading sessions in response to worries
about gilts funding and the prospect of a flood of rights issues, was much
happier after the immediate tension generated by the Gulf conflict had
abated. The FT-SE 100 Index clawed back 13.9 at 2,759.2, while the Mid 250
Index settled 11.8 higher at 2,888.1.
There was an element of slight unease in London at the outset, when dealers
fought shy of hoisting UK share prices because of Wall Street's unconvincing
overnight showing.
A good opening by the Footsie future, however, and some persistent strong
buying by domestic institutions, prompted by the UK interest rate cut hints,
drove shares sharply higher. Buying of the FT-SE 100 stocks gathered
momentum throughout a busy morning and lifted the index to a day's high of
2,771.3, up 26 points, by early afternoon.
The optimistic mood in London was quickly undermined during the afternoon,
when Wall Street began to falter after an early modest rise. The US market
was showing a fall of around four points as London closed and slipped
further after hours.
There was concern in the market that this morning will bring the first of a
series of rights issues. First National Finance, the troubled finance group,
has conceded the need to raise capital, and a call of around Pounds 50m has
long been forecast by the market. But other, and much bigger, cash calls are
said to be in the pipeline.
Questioned about the possibility of a further reduction in UK interest rates
in the short term, a top trader at one of the London merchant banks said he
would not dismiss the thought, pointing out that 'political pressure for
such a move is growing all the time'.
Official inflation numbers are due to be announced at 11.30 this morning,
with the general consensus for year-on-year inflation put at 3.5 per cent,
although there were suggestions among the more optimistic economic
forecasters that the figure could be nearer to 3 per cent.
Others, however, continued to take the view that the authorities could be
planning to keep rates at current levels until the UK Budget on March 16,
when a reduction could be used to alleviate criticism of what may well be a
tough Budget.
Around the sectors, oil shares came in for a further drubbing, with BP
affected by a further series of profits downgrades, many of which emanated
from US broking houses previously viewed as strongly supportive of the
stock. US investors now speak for getting on for 22 per cent of BP shares.
Turnover in London totalled 617.6m shares, with Ft-SE 100 shares accounting
for 243m shares and non-Footsie stock accounting for 374.5m shares.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Growth stock focus gives Dow
support
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>

Wall Street
BLUE CHIPS once again lagged behind the broader market as demand for
technology and small-capitalisation growth stocks helped to offset earnings
disappointments elsewhere, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.32 at 3,267.88. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 2.91 at 435.94 and the Nasdaq composite jumped
8.92 to set another record close of 695.70. Trading volume on the New York
SE came to 304.5m shares.
News of a 52,000 rise in weekly jobless claims surprised the market, because
the drop reversed the recent trend for improving job market conditions. This
was offset by better news on retail sales, which rose 1.2 per cent in
December. There was also good news on inflation, with the Labor Department
announcing that producer prices were up just 0.2 per cent last month.
With many investors still apprehensive about the immediate outlook for stock
prices and willing to wait until the quarterly reporting season is over,
leading issues remained locked in a narrow range.
Leading indices were pulled in different directions by a big loss in JP
Morgan on disappointing figures and a solid rise in some big technology
issues which reported stronger than expected earnings.
JP Morgan dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 in volume of 2.3m shares
after reporting that profits rose 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to
Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.48 a share. Although the net income figure was
slightly higher than forecasts, analysts were disappointed with JP Morgan's
operating earnings.
Motorola jumped Dollars 10 7/8 to Dollars 123 1/4 as investors reacted
positively to the news that fourth quarter profits reached Dollars 181m, up
from Dollars 126m a year earlier.
Digital Equipment was also in favour, soaring Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 42
1/4 in volume of 5.5m shares on news that the computer group's fiscal second
quarter losses narrowed to Dollars 73.8m, down from a figure of Dollars
155.2m a year ago.
The good news from the sector lifted other technology stocks, with IBM
rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 3/4 , Compaq putting on Dollars 3 1/8 at
Dollars 53 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard adding Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 74 1/8 .
Coca-Cola rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on reports that international
unit case volume in December was 11 per cent higher than the year before, a
big improvement on previous estimates of overseas sales growth.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended generally higher after an active session filled with
corporate news. A trader said that we seem to have turned around at the end
of the day, following New York higher, but golds and financials are still
pretty soft.
The TSE 300 index improved 5.5 to 3,303.8 and rises exceeded falls by 321 to
288. Volume amounted to 44.7m shares.
Molson A shares rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 29 1/4 on news that Philip
Morris's unit, Miller Brewing Co, will buy 20 per cent of Molson Breweries
for USDollars 273m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index marks time
as region moves ahead

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average closed marginally lower in thin trading ahead of a public
holiday, but underlying sentiment remained gloomy, writes Bethan Hutton in
Tokyo.
The 225-share Nikkei lost 2.31 at 16,515.60, after trading in a narrow range
around the 16,500 mark all day and setting a low for the session of
16,437.84 and a high of 16,568.98.
Volume contracted from Wednesday's 203.4m shares to around 170m, as many
investors stayed on the sidelines in advance of the long weekend. Declining
stocks continued to outnumber gains, by 589 to 277, and 208 issues closed
unchanged.
The broader Topix index of all first section shares ended 3.55 points down
at 1,267.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 1.32 to
1,029.86.
Selling by specified money trusts was balanced by support buying from public
pension funds and investment trusts when the Nikkei slipped below the 16,500
barrier.
Events in the Gulf had little effect on the market, as the US strike against
Iraq had been widely expected. Brokers said oil issues would not be affected
unless more serious fighting broke out. Nippon Oil was unchanged at Y580.
Department stores lost ground after figures released the previous day showed
December sales down 11.2 per cent on the year, and sales for the whole of
1992 down 5.7 per cent on 1991. Mitsukoshi slipped Y3 to Y727, Daimaru
retreated Y11 to Y535 and Hankyu dropped Y47 to Y770.
Small gains were seen in stocks expected to benefit from growing indications
that an economic recovery is under way in the US. In particular, computer
and electronics-related sectors drew some buying interest. TDK put on Y10 at
Y3,500, Mitsubishi Electric firmed Y2 to Y472 and Matsushita Electric
Industrial added Y10 at Y1,100, but NEC finished Y6 off at Y636.
Producers of Interferon were hit by high volume selling for a second day on
news that the Health Ministry wants to limit the drug's prescription for
Hepatitis C patients. Sumitomo Chemical fell Y13 to Y418, after losing Y24
the day before, while its specialist trading affiliate Inabata dipped Y10 to
Y1,050. Toray Industries dropped a further Y14 to Y615.
NTT, the telecommunications group, weakened for the eighth consecutive day,
closing Y4,000 cheaper at Y528,000 after low volume.
In Osaka the OSE index declined 112.58 to 18,051.76, with 71.4m shares
traded.
Roundup
SHRUGGING OFF events in the Middle East, most of the Pacific Rim region's
markets improved yesterday.
HONG KONG retained its impetus from overseas institutional investors,
attracted by the colony's still-booming economy and low price/earnings
ratios and less nervous over its political outlook than the locals. The Hang
Seng index closed 111.42 higher at 5,890.16 for a four-day gain of 6.5 per
cent.
Among the most active issues, HSBC finished 50 cents ahead at HKDollars
60.50, Hang Seng Bank 50 cents up at HKDollars 56.50 and Hutchison Whampoa
30 cents higher at HKDollars 16.50.
SINGAPORE rebounded as investors bought index-linked stocks, the Straits
Times Industrial index rising 25.46 to 1,558.40 in volume of 84.46m shares,
against 94.88m on Wednesday.
Malaysian motor shares were in focus after news that the government had
eased financing rules for vehicle purchases.
KUALA LUMPUR matched Singapore's interest in its own motor stocks, Tan
Chong, UMW Holdings, Oriental Holdings and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang firming
between 37 and 60 cents each as the composite index appreciated 5.53 to
619.81.
TAIWAN was encouraged by expectations that parliament would pass legislation
today or tomorrow reducing the stock transaction tax. The weighted index
advanced 69.63, or 2.2 per cent, to 3,297.56 in turnover of TDollars 11.8bn.
BOMBAY looked ahead to the February 28 national budget, rather than back at
three days of riots, and the BSE index rose 39.11 to 2,459.67.
AUSTRALIA featured Westpac following the resignations of Mr Kerry Packer and
another director over a dispute about the bank's restructuring plans. The
stock fell 13 cents to ADollars 2.91 in high volume of 11.3m shares. The All
Ordinaries index ended 12.4 higher at 1,507.4, helped by a fall in the
December unemployment rate.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt cheered by Siemens
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were mostly stronger yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT brightened on unexpectly strong results from Siemens, which posted
higher 1991-92 profits and a 2 per cent gain in net for the first three
months of the current year, against expectations of a 5 to 10 per cent
decline. The stock rose DM5.90 to DM578.90, enhanced by short-covering.
The DAX index added 7.24 to 1,523.74 as German market turnover fell from
DM4.3bn to DM3.7bn.
Volkswagen, which had hit DM254.40 in late trading on Wednesday, recovered
to close at DM259.40, 90 pfg higher on the official session. Mr Michael
Geiger of NatWest Securities said that spending cuts announced on Wednesday
were not deep enough and would not produce the savings required to make the
shares attractive at this level.
The speciality retailer, Douglas, rose DM15 to DM426 on a 7 per cent gain in
group turnover for 1992. Allianz showed little reaction to car insurance
losses, the result of car thefts, gaining DM8 at DM1,956.
PARIS rallied on hopes of lower interest rates, and the CAC-40 index ended
21.01 higher at 1,803.54 in turnover of FFr2.6bn.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks were in the limelight as Eurotunnel jumped
FFr2.10 or 6.9 per cent to FFr32.70 in heavy volume of 3.9m shares. Paribas
put on FFr16.90 or 4.8 per cent to FFr371.90 and Suez added FFr12 to FFr265.
Rhone-Poulenc CIs fell FFr15 or 2.2 per cent to FFr511 as investors were
disappointed to read in a French newspaper that the company expected its
1992 operating profit increase to be a little less than its previous
forecast of 10 per cent.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by technical trading ahead of today's expiry of futures
options and the CBS Tendency Index rose 1.0 to 97.40.
Nedlloyd gained 80 cents to Fl 27.30 on reports that the company's pension
fund had increased its holding to over 9 per cent through the purchase of Mr
Torstein Hagen's 5 per cent stake.
KLM rose 90 cents to Fl 25.50 on news that it was to cooperate with JAL, the
Japanese airline, on routes out of Amsterdam to Madrid and Zurich. DAF put
on 20 cents to Fl 8.30 after its UK truck unit reported improved 1992 sales.
MILAN ended higher ahead of the close of the account today, on continued
expectations that the cabinet would approve fiscal incentives for equity
investors. The Comit index rose 9.33 to 468.18 in turnover estimated at less
than Wednesday's heavy L293.4bn.
However, savings shares came under pressure on fears of a negative
announcement regarding the convertibility of savings shares into ordinary
shares. Savings shares in Credito Italiano lost L146 or 7.1 per cent to
L1,903 while Banca Commerciale's savings shares slipped L134 or 3.7 per cent
to L3,504.
After the close, Iri said that savings shares in Credito Italiano will not
be converted into ordinary stock prior to the bank's privatisation.
MADRID rose on strong foreign interest and the general index put on 3.92 to
223.98 in high turnover of Pta24.5bn. Electrical utilities showed some of
the best gains on hopes of lower interest rates, with Iberdrola Pta18 higher
at Pta718. Tabacalera rose Pta115 to Pta4,315 on reports that it planned to
sell a 50 per cent stake in its Royal Brands subsidiary while Telefonica
advanced Pta65 to Pta1,245.
ZURICH transferred its attention from financials to industrials as the SMI
index rose 27.6 or 1.3 per cent to 2,104.3. Dealers said that foreign money
was mostly attracted to the banking and insurance sectors, and Winterthur
rose another SFr80 to SFr3,020.
TEL AVIV recovered strongly after three days of profit-taking. The blue chip
index jumped 4.37 or 2.15 per cent in turnover of Shk177m
COPENHAGEN closed 2.5 per cent lower on fears that the prime minister, Mr
Poul Schlueter, might be forced to resign following the release of a
damaging judicial report on a refugee scandal. The KFX top-20 index fell
1.92 to 75.17.
STOCKHOLM closed lower despite a drop in money market rates. The
Affarsvarlden General index slipped 7.9 to 922.6 in turnover of SKr866m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Rosier political climate lifts Latin
America - John Pitt reviews the performance of the world's emerging markets
last December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America showed strong gains among emerging markets last month. In
dollar terms, Argentina rose by 19.5 per cent while Brazil was just behind
with 16 per cent, according to data provided by the IFC, part of the World
Bank.
Argentina has recovered well since hitting year lows in November. Ms
Veronica Berger, at Latin American Securities in London, says economic
prospects have greatly improved: 'The bulk of the privatisation programme
was successfully carried out in 1992, IMF fiscal targets were met and latest
real GDP growth est-imates are around 9 per cent.'
Much of this was due to a political willingness to tackle inflation. The
virtual elimination of the budget deficit has already cut the rate to 20 per
cent a year, from nearly 200 per cent a month in July 1989.
The stock market was also assisted by the completion of the privatisation of
Gas del Estado, and investors are now waiting for the sale later this year
of a 70 per cent stake in YPF, the state oil group and the country's largest
company.
Brazil has also gained from an improved political climate following the
resignation of President Fernando Collor de Mello. Although Mr Collor
delayed his departure until December 29, just before his impeachment trial
on corruption charges was to begin in the senate, the market began its rally
about a week before.
This followed a decision by the then-acting president, Mr Itamar Franco, to
allow Telebras, the telecommunications group, to increase tariffs by some 6
per cent in real terms over the next six months. This went against his
earlier statements that prices would be kept down to fight inflation and
make the service more accessible to the lower-paid.
Since then the new government has unveiled its economic blueprint with the
aim of lowering interest rates, investing some Dollars 4bn in
infrastructure, health and education projects, and increasing the minimum
salary.
Indonesia, which lost 7 per cent in dollar terms, was the worst performer in
December. Sentiment was depressed by the decline in Astra's share price as
the founding Soeryadjaya family sold heavily to help pay off the obligations
of their privately owned Bank Summa, which was ordered into liquidation by
the central bank on December 14. The family eventually lost majority control
of the automotive group as the year closed.
Wardley James Capel remains bullish about Indonesia. 'We feel that the
banking crisis and the Astra fiasco has been overdone and that earnings per
share growth will surprise in 1993 and 1994,' the broker says in a recent
document.
Wardley offers some words of caution too: 'Our major concern is the possible
massive explosion of scrip supply; and how long it will be before investors
trust the families enough to start buying again.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Resignation raises tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a small rise in tension inside the European exchange rate
mechanism last night as Mr Poul Schluter's resignation as Danish prime
minister raised concern that Denmark's krone might come under renewed
selling pressure, writes James Blitz.
Mr Schluter's resignation came at 5pm London time yesterday, well after the
close of official ERM trading. Markets had little time for a considered
reaction.
After opening in London at DKr3.8615 to the D-Mark, the krone weakened in
the European morning to around DKr3.8750. Following the resignation
announcement, it was quoted at DKr3.8646 at lunchtime in the US, some way
above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
The main concern of currency traders is that political tension in Copenhagen
may create doubts about Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty in
its second referendum on the issue this spring.
Mr Schluter's call for Mr Henning Dyermose, the finance minister, to replace
him raised suggestions that a big change in Danish politics was not
imminent.
However, Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London,
said there was certain to be pressure on the currency in the next few days.
'In the very short term, the resignation is negative, because any
uncertainty is not liked by the markets,' he commented.
The Irish punt came under renewed pressure in the ERM last night, falling
close to its floor against the Dutch guilder
In recent days, the Irish authorities have reduced money market rates in an
attempt to avert a threatened rise in commercial base rates which would
further hurt the Irish economy.
The central bank announced yesterday that it was dropping its overnight
lending rate to 15 per cent from 30 per cent. However, in afternoon trading
in the US, the punt was quoted at NFl 2.9599, not far above its ERM floor of
NFl 2.9510.
According to Mr John Hall, an international economist at Swiss Banking Corp
in London, the progressive cuts in Irish interest rates have raised concern
about the new government's willingness to defend the currency.
'They have taken every opportunity to cut rates this week,' he said. 'If
they really wanted to defend the currency, they should have kept rates
high.'
Sterling fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, amid rumours that the UK
government was planning to reduce base rates in conjunction with today's
figures for the retail price index.
Far from encouraging the belief that rates will be lowered, the UK
authorities have been adamant that monetary policy is on hold for the time
being.
However, the pound dropped by 2.25 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday,
closing at DM2.4900.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Focus on UK rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was speculation about a near term cut in UK base rates in the sterling
cash market yesterday morning, as short-dated money rates came down to very
low levels for the second day running, writes James Blitz.
The UK government has given strong indications in recent weeks that another
base rate cut is not due for some time. But a number of factors yesterday
encouraged dealers to think this was a possibility.
One reason was a sharp increase in cash supply in the market, which helped
to push the overnight rate as low as 4 per cent.
As on every day this week, the Bank of England forecast a small shortage.
Yesterday's morning forecast was for Pounds 800m, which was later revised up
to Pounds 850m.
There was mild excitement, too, that the Bank of England offered a
repurchase agreement of Pounds 550m at the established rate of 6 15/16 per
cent in the early round.
A repo offer can sometimes be used to underline the downward movement of
market rates. However, one dealer suggested that the Bank may have been
accommodating for purely technical reasons, possibly because today's
shortage is expected to be very high.
There was a strong impact on cash and futures markets. Three-month money was
again very soft, closing around the base rate figure of 7 per cent as it did
on Wednesday night. The March short sterling contract closed 8 basis points
up at 93.42, a level which prices in more than 40 basis points off
three-month money in the next two months.
Continuing speculation that Germany will ease monetary policy may also have
compounded the positive mood in the sterling market. Conciliatory comments
earlier this week from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
helped the March Euromark contract to rise 8 basis points to end at 92.18.
However, French franc futures hit record lows, with the March contract
finishing 27 basis points down at 92.10.
Denmark's growing political difficulties have weakened the Danish krone,
arousing new concern about the franc. There were rumours yesterday that if
three-month French francs do not come below 11 1/2 per cent within the next
few days, French commercial banks may be forced to pass the cost of high
money market rates on to the consumer.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices sheltered from a
turbulent week - High output has countered the effects of gales and air
strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS ago the threat of air strikes against Iraq was driving oil prices
to the highest level for years, but the market barely batted an eyelid after
this week's raids against Saddam Hussein's missile sites. Even several days'
of production disruptions in the North Sea, with severe gales preventing
tankers from loading, has failed to lift prices for Brent crude.
The fact that both developments had little or no effect on world prices
underlined the weakness of the market, which is primarily a result of
over-production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. At the
same time, Iraq is banned by United Nations' sanctions from exporting oil
and tension between Washington and Baghdad constitutes no short-term threat
to oil supplies.
Prices for North Sea Brent crude edged upwards yesterday but traders are not
expecting substantial gains: oil product stocks are high, Opec shows no
signs of staunching the flow of oil to the market and demand remains
depressed.
Persistently high output has caused prices to slide by about Dollars 1 a
barrel from the already low level which ruled at the beginning of the year,
and several analysts are forecasting a further decline to Dollars 16 a
barrel before the mid-February Opec meeting.
'There is still plenty of oil in the world, demand is not great and I see no
upward pressure on price,' said Mr Tom Manning, market analyst at Purvin and
Gertz, the Houston-based consultants.
The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, expects
world demand for oil to rise by only 1 per cent this year, or 600,000
barrels a day to 67.6m b/d. Even this modest pick-up in consumption is not
expected to materialise until the second half of the year as world economic
activity increases.
Oil companies have built up their stocks of crude oil and products
significantly and are not selling them off as quickly as they usually do at
this time of year, chiefly because the weather in North America and Europe
has not been as cold as usual. The American Petroleum Institute reported
late on Tuesday that US stocks of gasoline had increased by more than 5m
barrels in the previous week.
Although some refineries in the US have trimmed production rates, this has
not been enough to soak up high product inventories.
By cutting output Opec could throw support under current low oil prices, but
the organisation is yet to show much political will for this. Mr Alirio
Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines and Opec's current
president, is to embark on a tour of the Middle East next week in a bid to
build consensus for a cut in production.
He is unlikely to be successful unless prices fall far enough to concentrate
producers' minds and many Opec watchers believe prices will have to decline
by at least another Dollars 1 a barrel to galvanise member countries into
taking action.
Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a
Washington consultancy, believes the call on Opec oil will fall from about
25m b/d by at least 2m b/d in the second quarter which is in line with
Opec's own forecast of 23.45m b/d. 'But there is a complicated process at
work in cutting output because countries are simultaneously battling for
market share,' he said.
Opec members have steadfastly ignored November's production agreement, which
called for cuts in output to a ceiling of 24.58m b/d, and actual production
has totalled more than 25m b/d. Big producers are struggling to maximise
market share, which improves their clout within the organisation.
Saudi Arabia and Iran hold the key to a production deal as they pump the
most oil. But traders at leading international oil companies say they have
already booked their oil purchases from the two producers for February and
are even buying March oil from Iran.
Saudi Arabia's scheduled sales point to a production rate of 8.4m b/d in
February, indicating a slight reduction since the kingdom's share of oil
output in the neutral zone - between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - will be shut
in for maintenance work. This implies a slight cut of about 150,000 b/d from
January's production.
Iran's sales programme points to a rate of 3.5m to 3.6m b/d - little or no
reduction from current levels.
Mr Joe Stanislaw, market watcher at Cambridge Energy Research Associates has
blamed the current tension in the market on a 'triangle of contention'. This
includes Kuwait's rapid production rebound, uncertainty over Iraq's
resumption of exports and underlying competition between Saudi Arabia and
Iran over market share, Opec leadership and, ultimately, regional
pre-eminence.
The bombing of Iraq will presumably extend the United Nations' ban on Iraqi
exports of oil - giving Opec a breathing space on that score. But the
governments in Riyadh and Tehran still need to agree on cuts and on a way to
curb Kuwait's growing output.
On top of the immediate imperatives, Opec nations are all lifting capacity
faster than demand is rising. A report by the Centre for Global Energy
Studies in London estimates Opec capacity will rise by 2.7m b/d this year
excluding Iraq. The report warns that Opec must exercise restraint if it is
to see prices rise.
Falling production from the former Soviet Union has, in the past, given Opec
room to manoeuvre on capacity increases. Production from the Commonwealth of
Independent States dropped last year to 9m b/d from 10.4m b/d in 1991,
according to the IEA. That decline should stabilise slightly this year, but
the body still expects output to fall to 8m b/d.
Opec nations are aware of the need to give the market a clear signal that
they are prepared to make some production cutbacks in the second quarter.
But if prices stabilise at today's levels, the political will to trim output
will not be as great. The more prices fall, the more likely Opec is to cut.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber suppliers threaten
restrictions to lift prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUBBER producing countries are threatening to restrict supplies if consumer
nations are unable to agree on a new international rubber pact.
They may be forced to impose restictions in an effort to lift prices, the
Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said at the end of a
meeting in Hatyai, Thailand.
The ANRPC groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New
Guinea and Singapore, which together account for about 80 per cent of the
world's natural rubber output.
It accuses the consumer countries of delaying attempts to negotiate a new
international rubber agreement (INRA). The current pact expires at the end
of this year, though it can be extended, by agreement, by up to two years.
Mr Sucharit Promdej, the ANRPC's secretary general, said the ANRPC was
preparing to revive a 1976 price stabilisation agreement between the main
producer countries. This would impose production and export restraints and
provide financial resources for the operations of the producers' own buffer
stock.
Mr Sucharit said producers would meet in Sri Lanka next month to update the
rules of the 1976 agreement. 'An extension of INRA is unacceptable, at least
not without a prior commitment from consumer countries to renegotiate,' said
Mr Sucharit.
At present most of the world's natural rubber industry is overseen by the
International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO), which groups both
producers and consumers. The INRO buffer stock manager has stockpiled more
than 160,000 tonnes of natural rubber over the past three years in an
attempt to stabilise prices.
At the end of the month INRO is due to decide whether to cut its buffer
stock reference price because of low prices.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore groups in Australia
and Brazil cut prices to EC, Japan

IRON ORE producers in Brazil and Australia have been forced for the second
successive year to cut prices at the end of the annual round of contract
talks with steel customers in Europe and Japan.
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the Brazilian state-controlled company that is
the world's leading exporter of iron ore, has cut the price of its exports
to German steel producers by 10 to 12 per cent.
CVRD suggested this would set the pattern for its prices for the rest of
Europe - where Germany is the group's biggest customer - and for agreements
with Japanese and South Korean steel companies when contracts were
renegotiated in April and May.
Following CVRD's lead, Hamersley Iron of Australia, owned by CRA, cut 11 per
cent from the prices of fines ore for delivery to Japanese steel mills and 9
per cent from lump ore.
Robe River, part of North Broken Hill, another Australian natural resources
group, agreed a cut of 12.79 per cent with its Japanese customers.
CVRD revealed that the German accord contained a price reduction for pellets
to Dollars 28 a tonne, down from Dollars 31. High grade sinter material from
the Carajas site, will go for Dollars 18.15 per tonne instead of the
previous Dollars 20.65 while southern sinter will be priced at Dollars 16.90
a tonne, down from Dollars 19.
A CVRD official noted that the price reductions marked the continuation of a
trend dating from last year, when prices fell by 7 per cent for pellets and
by nearly 5 per cent for sinter. Lower demand, reflecting the world
recession and its manifestations in the steel sector, is primarily
responsible for the price falls, which reversed an upward trend that had
started in 1989.
Germany consumes about 13 per cent of Brazilian exports, roughly the same as
South Korea. Japan is the most important market for CVRD's iron ore.
CVRD's output of iron ore declined last year to 86.8m tonnes, of which 60.4m
was exported. In 1991, the company produced 93.6m tonnes, of which 66.8m
tonnes was shipped abroad.
Mr Rod Kinkead-Weekes, Hamersley's managing director for sales and marketing
said: 'Since 1988 the same fines price changes have applied to Australia and
Brazil and to have departed from the 11 to 12 per cent price cuts already
agreed by the Brazilians in Europe would have compromised our
competitiveness.' He said Hamersley was likely to ship more iron ore to
Japan than in 1992 since Japanese crude steel production was expected to
rise slightly.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aid pledge to US farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MIKE Espy, the nominee for agriculture secretary in the Clinton
administration, yesterday vowed to continue export promotion and subsidies
to ensure that US farmers could 'compete on a fair and equal basis' with the
European Community.
Speaking at his confirmation hearing before the Senate agriculture
committee, he pointed to a record of six years in the House of
Representatives where he supported programmes to boost US exports. The US,
he said, must let its trading partners know 'we will not be pushed around'.
The tough talk could not but gratify the senators. Mr Espy, the first
agriculture secretary from the south, proved equally pleasing with his
promise to continue the restructuring and streamlining of the Dollars
62bn-a-year US department of agriculture 'from top to bottom'. Unlike his
predecessor, who was planning to consolidate field offices, he would begin
the reforms in Washington.
In a sometimes impassioned opening statement, Mr Espy promised to support
farmer income (without saying whether or not he would raise price supports)
and the poor and the 'dying' small towns of America. 'Hungry children don't
just exist in Somalia,' he said.
He won a rare round of applause from the onlookers. 'This may be the best
time you'll ever have up here,' Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority
leader, warned.
The mood of jocularity evaporated when Mr Espy was asked about
irregularities found in the book-keeping of his election campaign for the
House of Representatives. 'This has caused me the most grief,' the nominee
said, beginning a halting explanation of how his brother, Tom, had kept his
books; Tom was not an accountant but 'just a brother'; and the Justice
Department had cleared him of wrongdoing.
Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, seemed to accept the
explanation, but admonished the nominee to appoint a strong, skilled
administration team, so he could 'avoid being blindsided'.
It was a day of warnings. Senator Ken Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat,
cautioned him that he was entering 'a cauldron' of competing interests -
involving those who wanted higher domestic prices and those who wanted to
raise the volume of exports.
'Mr Espy will come under pressure from those opposed to export-oriented farm
policy,' Senator Lugar said.
'Policy changes that result in reduced exports, such as higher loan rates,
the abandonment of meaningful Gatt discussions or failure to ratify the
North American Free Trade Agreement would be a grave error.'
As expected, Mr Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union,
which is endorsed by Mr Espy, urged higher loan rates.

iron carbide plant

A US company is building a Dollars 60m plant in Trinidad to produce iron
carbide from iron ore imported from Brazil.
The Nucor Corporation of North Carolina says the plant will produce 320,000
tonnes of iron carbide per year, and that the material will be exported to
the US for use in the company's steel mills.
Construction of the plant will begin in the first quarter of this year, with
production scheduled to start in the last quarter of next year. Nucor says
the Trinidad plant will be the first to use the company's patented process
to convert iron ore into iron carbide using natural gas.
The iron carbide plant will be fired by locally produced natural gas, and
will be located at the Point Lisas industrial complex in south central
Trinidad.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian contractor likely for
Siberian copper project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S BIGGEST copper deposit, at Udokan in eastern Siberia, is expected
to be awarded on Monday to a group of Russian enterprises as part of the
government's attempts to help its ailing industrial plants find new
business.
Only two companies finally submitted proposals in an international tender to
draw up a feasibility study for the project after six large western mining
companies dropped out of the race citing either a lack of time to prepare
properly or complaining about the content of the copper.
The two remaining contenders were Australia's BHP and the Udokan Mining
Company, which is considered the Russian participant in spite of being
half-owned by two little known foreign companies.
UMC is backed by a group of Russian industrial plants which want to provide
the equipment for the Dollars 1bn development. It is almost certain to win,
given the Russian government's desire to help factories switch from military
production to civilan output and a market system.
UMC's lack of experience of a big mining project is being compensated for by
advice from Fluor Daniel, the San Francisco-based mining consultancy, which
has already submitted a detailed feasibility study for the project.
Under Fluor Daniel's proposals, the project would be financed through a
combination of fund-raising by a New York investment bank, copper
concentrate sales to China, and export credit guarantees to finance imports
of machinery from the West.
Under the terms of a tentative contract, UMC has arranged to sell 200,000
tonnes of concentrate from the mine, once it comes on stream around 1997, to
China's National Non-Ferrous Metals Company. Under the 25-year agreement,
China, which is connected to Udokan by the Baikul-Amur Railway, would in
turn dispatch the concentrate to smelters which it will build specially to
cope with the concentrate's high sulphur content. The resulting copper would
then be used within China or re-exported.
In keeping with UMC's original purpose, the bulk of equipment to build the
mine and accompanying infrastructure is to be produced by more than a dozen
Russian companies plus Belaz, the Belorussian vehicles producer, all grouped
in a consortium led by Uralmash, the Urals heavy engineering plant.
The tender committee was due to produce its recommendations on the competing
proposals today, leaving the final decision to be taken by the Russian
president and government. The winner is expected to be announced on Monday.

The GOLD price moved higher in early trading at the London bullion market
yesterday in a somewhat confused response to news of heavy sales from Dutch
reserves. But after being fixed at Dollars 328.20 a troy ounce in the
morning the price headed back towards recent the seven-year low as central
bank lending 'pushed the market back into perspective', in the words of one
trader. It was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 327.65 an ounce and closed
at Dollars 327.55, up 10 cents on the day. In an otherwise quiet day at the
London Metal Exchange ZINC prices moved up quite sharply in relatively light
trading. As traders covered earlier short sales the three months price moved
up to a five-week high of Dollars 1,101 a tonne, but by the close it was a
back to Dollars 1,195.75, up Dollars 21 on the day, and it lost more ground
in after-hours trading. The slide in NICKEL prices continued as investment
fund selling pushed the three months price down another Dollars 117.50 to
Dollars Dollars 5,905 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange
COCOA prices continued to edge higher amid chart-inspired buying.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Spain leads high-yield sectors gaining
from ERM relaxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>

THE EASING of tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism helped to
lift some of the higher-yielding government bond markets yesterday.
Some investors were encouraged to switch out of the hard-core currencies and
into higher-yielding assets as the pressure on the French franc and Irish
punt appeared to have lessened, allowing Ireland to lower interest rates
yesterday.
Spain was the chief beneficiary of the easing in ERM tensions, dealers said,
with the yield on 10-year paper falling from 12.35 per cent to 12.18 per
cent yesterday. Although short-term interest rates remain high, making it
expensive for investors to fund their positions, dealers noted that there
had been some overseas buying of long-dated Spanish bonds.
Mr Steve Major, bond analyst with Credit Lyonnais, said that in addition to
the easing of ERM tensions, buying interest has been stimulated by hopes
that relatively favourable inflation data would emerge today.
Danish government bonds ended lower after a day spent speculating over
whether the Danish prime minister, Mr Poul Schlueter, would be forced to
resign following criticism of his role in the so-called Tamil case.
Mr Schlueter announced his resignation in the late afternoon, but dealers
said the bond market was jittery most of the day before the announcement.
Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds held steady, ending the day
slightly firmer with the Liffe bund future contract rising from 92.84 at the
opening to 93.02 by late afternoon.
Dealers said the market was quiet in the absence of important economic news
or statements from the Bundesbank.
UK government bond prices ended mostly firmer yesterday on market hopes of a
base rate cut, possibly in conjunction with the release of favourable retail
price index data today.
The Liffe gilt future contract opened at 99.30, touched a low of 99.23, and
ended the day at around the high of 100.00 on relatively large volume of
32,000 contracts.
However, some economists dismissed the possibility of an imminent base rate
cut as unlikely. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said
the gilt-edged market was taking its cue from relatively low overnight
rates. 'Short-term money has been low, but for mainly technical reasons, not
on fundamentals,' he said.
THE JAPANESE government bond market saw a volatile trading session closing
with prices higher on the day due to reports that the ministry of finance
planned to buy back government debt.
The market opened on a firm note on hopes of an easing in interest rates and
as the stock market remained in a weak state, but then changed direction as
investors took profits. However, close to the end of the trading session,
news emerged that the finance ministry's trust fund bureau will start buying
bonds outright soon.
The benchmark No 145 issue opened at a yield of 4.435 per cent and moved to
4.39 per cent, corresponding to a new high price for the cash bond. The
yield closed at 4.395 per cent in Tokyo but moved to 4.38 per cent in London
trading.
US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday, aided by
sporadic retail buying and suggestions that President-elect Clinton may not
follow through his campaign of cutting middle class taxes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 102
21/32 , yielding 7.397 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 15/32 , to yield 4.355 per cent.
The main economic news of the day was the Labor department's announcement
that state unemployment insurance claims rose by 52,000 in the week that
ended January 2. At first glance, the big increase in jobless claims was
positive for the market, but analysts, dealers and investors were suspicious
of the data, which bucks the recently established trend of declining
unemployment claims.
Any bullish news on the jobs market was offset by data showing retail sales
rose 1.2 per cent in December, a sign that consumer spending is picking up.
The day's other important figure - a 0.2 per cent increase in producer
prices last month - had no impact on sentiment.

<TEXT>
A US Federal regulator yesterday ruled that swaps trading - a large and
growing global over-the-counter derivative market - will for the most part
be exempt from rules that govern US futures markets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US watchdog for futures and
other derivatives trading, received power to exempt swaps from its oversight
when it was reauthorised late last year.
Up to now, swaps trading, had faced the danger of being declared invalid if
it were successfully proven that they were futures, and thus had to be
traded on an established futures exchange. US commodities exchanges had
hoped that the CFTC's regulatory exemption for dealer-traded swaps would be
extended to their own proposed exchange-traded swaps products. However, the
CFTC indicated the exchanges would have to apply for exemptions on a
case-by-case basis.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Chile to ease curbs on
pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE plans to relax restrictions on the stock market investments of its
fast-growing local pension funds.
The proposals are aimed at providing new investment opportunities for the
pension funds as well as opening new sources of finance for smaller
companies.
They would allow the funds to invest in most of the 240 stocks now listed on
the Santiago stock exchange - instead of the 40 most tradeable stocks as at
present - as well as in start-up projects and to provide venture capital.
The pension funds, which together with insurance companies are responsible
for about Dollars 17bn of assets, have been growing at about Dollars 300m a
month: so rapidly that, under current rules, they have been running out of
investment opportunities.
The proposals, announced in Santiago by Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance
minister, were received positively by the Chilean stock market, which
rallied 0.64 per cent on Wednesday and was 1.7 per cent higher during
trading yesterday.
This was despite uncertainty surrounding plans to reduce the maximum a
pension fund can hold in most companies to 5 per cent of total
capitalisation from 7 per cent.
This would require many pension funds to sell substantial holdings in many
of the larger companies. However, according to James Capel's emerging market
researchers in New York: 'Most observers feel that, in the event that such a
measure were introduced, the time period in which the disposals would have
to take place would be sufficiently long to ensure minimal market
disruption.'
A new draft law, part of a general reform of Chile's financial markets, will
be sent for consideration by Congress in Valparaiso in the next few days,
the government said.
