FT  15 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Sweden turns to Euroyen market to raise
Ecu6.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Sweden restarted the Ecu31bn borrowing programme it launched
last year to rebuild its foreign currency reserves by tapping the Euroyen
market yesterday for the first time in nearly five years.
In its latest round of borrowings, Sweden has already tapped the Euromarkets
for D-Marks, French francs, sterling and US dollars. It now needs to borrow
a further Ecu6.6bn or so to complete the programme, and will not restrict
itself to the capital markets for the balance. Mr Staffan Crona,
director-general of the National Debt Office, said commercial paper and
private placements were other possibilities.
Although Sweden has now rebuilt its published reserves from last September's
low point to pre-crisis levels, the figure being quoted yesterday of around
SKr160bn shows slippage from the SKr176.1bn quoted in November. The
government's foreign debt currently stands at around SKr250bn.
Nomura International, leading the first Euroyen issue of the year, said the
bonds were bid at around the issue price after being freed to trade.
The volume of business done in sterling provided the surprise of the day.
Eurofima, the Basle-based rolling stock company which is an infrequent
borrower in sterling, reopened the sector with a Pounds 100m five-year issue
offering a spread of 27 basis points over comparable gilts. The bonds were
targeted to continental European investors, said lead-manager Daiwa.
Eurofima, which says it plans to borrow SFr4bn to SFr5bn in 1993, agreed
that the spread on its first international bond launched this year was
tight, but said it was confident it would tighten further. This is the first
Eurosterling deal solely led by a Japanese house for a non-Japanese
borrower, said Daiwa.
The three other sterling deals, for Pounds 100m each from Credit Foncier de
France, National &amp; Provincial Building Society and Nordic Investment Bank,
all mature in the second half of 1998, in order to take advantage of the
steepness of the yield curve. This allows the borrowers to benefit from
better swap rates, while still paying investors the sort of yield they would
expect on a straight five-year maturity.
Bankers attributed the flurry of activity in sterling to a combination of
swap opportunities and European demand for sterling bonds. The rush of new
bonds quickly outstripped demand, bankers said.
International Finance Corp's Dollars 300m three-year issue was described by
some bankers as aggressively priced at a spread of 18 basis points over US
Treasuries. IFC suffers from a relative lack of name recognition, despite
its triple A status as a World Bank affiliate. Lead-manager Morgan Stanley
International said the notes traded at the issue price after breaking
syndicate.
The issue comes on the heels of the European Investment Bank's Dollars 400m
deal earlier this week and could go a long way towards satisfying current
demand for shorter dated dollar paper, said bankers.
Set for pricing this morning is LKB's DM1bn five-year Eurobond, led by
Dresdner Bank, Morgan Stanley International and Trinkaus und Burkhardt.
Bankers said the indicated spread looked tight at 17 to 19 basis points over
German governments, particularly when compared with the large five-year
issues from the UK and KfW late last year. Both were yesterday trading at
spreads of around 17 basis points.
Morgan Stanley led another small reverse floating rate note, for the
European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development. The DM100m seven-year issue
pays a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent in the first year, and 19 per cent minus
twice six-month Libor thereafter.

HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday completed a Dollars
1.25bn offering of debt in the US capital markets through its subsidiary,
Hanson Overseas.
The sale was the first time Hanson, which has extensive US business
interests, has tapped the US long-term public debt markets - until now, the
company has raised money in the US via commercial paper offerings.
First Boston, the Wall Street investment bank that acted as lead-manager for
the underwriting, said that demand for the Hanson debt was so strong that
the size of the issue was increased at the last minute from Dollars 850m to
Dollars 1.25bn. This made it the largest ever issue of Yankee bonds
(dollar-denominated bonds sold in the US by foreign issuers).
The issue, which was oversubscribed, consisted of Dollars 500m of 5 1/2 per
cent notes due in 1996 priced to yield 5.592 per cent at maturity, and
Dollars 750m of 7 3/8 per cent notes due in 2003 priced to yield 7.451 per
cent at maturity. Hanson said that proceeds from the offering would be used
to repay existing short-term debt.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nissan and Mazda in supply deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN and Mazda, two of Japan's leading carmakers, have agreed to provide
each other with small vans and light trucks in a significant step towards
the consolidation of the hard-pressed Japanese motor industry.
Under the deal, Nissan is likely to suspend production of some of its light
commercial vehicles and instead sell trucks supplied by Mazda. Mazda will
streamline its range of vans by being supplied by Nissan.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said the alliance was designed to
improve profitability by reducing development costs.
The partnership is the latest sign of the pressure Japan's vehicle makers
are under to cut costs in response to sharp falls in profits over the past
two years.
It follows a similar deal announced last month between Isuzu and Honda.
Isuzu will supply Honda with its Rodeo recreational vehicle, plugging an
important gap in Honda's product range. Honda will supply Isuzu with small
passenger cars. Isuzu is pulling out of passenger car production.
The pressure for consolidation among the weaker producers in the Japanese
car industry, which is struggling beneath a burden of excess production
capacity, marks a sharp change of fortune.
Until about 18 months ago, the Japanese producers were confidently expanding
across the world and widening their product ranges. In the past year, cuts
in capital investment have become widespread, companies are lengthening the
gap between model changes and pulling in their horns internationally.
Analysts believe the current downturn may usher in an era of slow growth in
car demand which will make it increasingly difficult for Japan to support
nine fiercely competitive car producers.
The Japanese industry is separating into two groups. Companies such as
Toyota, the leading producer, Mitsubishi and Suzuki are weathering the
downturn in relatively sound financial health.
However producers such as Nissan, Mazda and Honda have been badly hit by
declining sales just as they are shouldering the financial burden of heavy
investments they made in the late 1980s.
Mr Koji Endo, analyst at S. G. Warburg securities said: 'No Japanese maker
other than Toyota has the resources to sustain a comprehensive product
range. This deal is the first step towards a wider partnership and other
companies will have to follow, targeting their resources at specific
segments of the market.'
Nissan reported a loss in the six months to the end of last September of
Y14.24bn (Dollars 113m) largely because it has been losing market share in
Japan's declining market. Nissan's sales in Japan last year fell by 20 per
cent to 546,778 units and its market share fell by 1.2 per cent to 22 per
cent.
Mazda reported a 73 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of
the year to Y3bn.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup increases bid for
Arnotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday increased its takeover offer for
Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, from ADollars 8.80 to ADollars 8.50 a
share, valuing the group at just under ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 874m).
The increased offer followed a ruling by the New South Wales Supreme Court
that a 1985 agreement between the companies means that Campbell cannot vote
more than 14.9 per cent of its shareholding unless it acquires at least 85.1
per cent of Arnotts' stock.
Arnotts had appealed against an earlier ruling by a lower court that the
agreement would become invalid if Campbell acquired more than 40 per cent of
Arnotts' shares. Campbell is thought unlikely to consider a further appeal
to the federal High Court.
Campbell, which owns 32.9 per cent of Arnotts, had hoped to acquire a
further 17.2 per cent of the stock for ADollars 206m, giving it a majority
shareholding of 50.1 per cent.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, said the revised offer was
'final' and would not be improved.
However, analysts said the offer might be insufficient to acquire a large
enough holding to exercise control. Arnotts' shares closed 30 cents higher
at a record ADollars 9.50 on the Australian Stock Exchange, matching the
revised offer.
The revised bid represents a multiple of 27 times 1991-92 net profits, 13.1
times earnings before interest and tax, and twice Arnotts' sales in the last
full year.
Campbell said the offer took into account a forecast increase in Arnotts'
earnings in the first half of 1992-93.
Campbell's earlier offer was rejected by most Australian financial
institutions. Advisers to Arnotts have suggested that an offer of ADollars
12 would be required to win a recommendation from the board.
An independent report commissioned by Arnotts valued the group at a minimum
of ADollars 10.78 a share. Advisers to Campbell have said the valuation is
too high.
The shareholding agreement between the companies was drawn up when Campbell
took a friendly shareholding in Arnotts to help fight off an unwelcome
takeover bid by Mr Alan Bond, the former Australian entrepreneur.

HANWHA First Investment, the Dutch-based investment subsidiary of Korea's
Hanwha group, is to take control of Bank of Athens, a small state-owned bank
offered for sale under the Greek government's privatisation programme.
Hanwha, bidding in partnership with Rabo Bank of the Netherlands, offered
Dr6.8bn (Dollars 34m) for 66.7 per cent of the bank's common shares in the
first privatisation carried out through a public tender offer on the Athens
stock exchange.
Hanwha's bid of Dr6,180 per share for 1,106,020 shares of common stock was
ahead of Dr6,150 offered by Eteva, a Greek investment bank which made the
only other bid.
Minority shareholders were given an opportunity to accept the offer before
the state-owned National Bank of Greece, which controls 75 per cent of Bank
of Athens equity, released its shares for sale.
Hanwha, a Korean conglomerate with interests in financial services,
chemicals and oil products, is the first Asian investor in Greek banking.
Bank of Athens had profits of Dr2.06bn for 1991. First-half profits last
year declined by 9 per cent to Dr1.01bn.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac shares fall after Packer
resigns from board
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian bank, was plunged into renewed uncertainty
yesterday after Mr Kerry Packer and an associate resigned from the board
following a dispute about the bank's restructuring programme.
Westpac shares fell 13 cents to ADollars 2.91 after the resignations,
underlining market concern about the departure of Mr Packer, proprietor of
the Consolidated Press Holdings media group, and Mr Al Dunlap, ConsPress
managing director.
Analysts said the shares were likely to come under further pressure unless
the resignations were properly explained. However, ConsPress said neither Mr
Packer nor Mr Dunlap would comment.
Westpac said the resignations followed a 'disagreement' about management of
the restructuring programme, announced late last year after the bank
announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1bn) for the year
to the end of September.
The dispute is believed to have centred on the pace of restructuring and the
choice of a managing director to replace Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned in
December following pressure from Mr Packer and other major shareholders.
Mr Packer is believed to have sought the appointment of Mr Dunlap, an
American corporate restructuring specialist who has carried out a successful
shake-up at ConsPress over the past year.
Westpac said a replacement for Mr Conroy would be announced before the
bank's annual meeting next week, when the board is expected to be the target
of strong criticism from shareholders.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, said the board had agreed to accelerate the
restructuring programme by cutting between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of
staff over the next three years.
The bank also plans to cut costs and improve revenue by ADollars 300m a
year, reduce the ratio of expenses to revenue from 70 per cent to 58 per
cent, and cut corporate lending risks by ADollars 10bn by 1995.
Mr Packer is believed to have sought a much faster redundancy programme and
a bigger reduction in corporate lending, which would have reduced Westpac's
assets from ADollars 110bn to well below ADollars 100bn.
Mr Packer and Mr Dunlap formally joined the Westpac board last week after
ConsPress acquired nearly 10 per cent of Westpac's shares, close to the
ceiling allowed under federal banking law.
ConsPress could lift its holding to a maximum of 15 per cent, but only with
the consent of Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer and the Westpac board.
Westpac has been in difficulties since the failure in October of a ADollars
1.72bn rights issue which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, leaving many
sub-underwriters holding unwanted shares.
Five directors resigned after the rights issue debacle, including the then
chairman. The bank's shares, which traded at about ADollars 4.50 at the
beginning of 1991, fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 in November after
the announcement of the record loss.
Documents filed with the Australian Securities Commission, the corporate
watchdog, showed that ConsPress increased net profits to ADollars 467m in
the year to June 30, compared with ADollars 17.6m in the previous year.
The documents showed that the shake-up masterminded by Mr Dunlap included
the sale of more than 90 companies, leaving the company debt-free.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: MCRB plans to generate cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN Resources (MCRB), a group mainly involved in the property sector,
has disclosed details of how it intends to raise the cash to take up
controlling stakes in the New Straits Times Press, Malaysia's biggest media
group, and TV3, the country's only privately-owned television station.
Last week, the Renong Group, the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the
United Malays National Organisation, the country's main political party,
announced plans for the MDollars 800m (USDollars 320m) sale of NSTP and TV3
to Realmild, a small company controlled by four senior NSTP executives.
Subsequently, the four announced that MCRB would be the takeover vehicle for
the management buy-out of Renong's media interests.
MCRB plans to raise MDollars 440m through a rights issue, MDollars 110m
through bonds with transferable subscription rights and MDollars 250m
through bank borrowings and internally generated funds.
Under the terms of the deal reached between Realmild and Renong, the cash
for the media interests - bought at a substantial premium to NSTP's and
TV3's present share prices - has to be raised within six months.
The deal has been viewed with intense interest - and some scepticism - by
Malaysia's business people and politicians.
There are doubts that even if the MCRB cash-raising exercise is successful,
Realmild will be able to generate enough cash from NSTP and TV3 to repay
loans and provide dividends to shareholders.
Realmild is believed to be closely linked to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
finance minister. Analysts say Mr Anwar is keen to gain influence over the
country's important media groups in the run-up to party elections later this
year which are likely to decide a successor to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
country's prime minister.
It is believed that Realmild might need a substantial cash injection to make
its acquisitions of NSTP and TV3 a success. There have been rumours that
Hicom, an investment holding company controlled by the ministry of finance,
might be interested in taking up a stake in Realmild.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Airlines yesterday announced drastic restructuring plans aimed at
reversing pre-tax losses estimated at Y50bn (Dollars 398m) for the year to
March 1993.
Over the next two years, the airline plans to cut investment by Y100bn a
year and costs by Y100bn next year.
Total investment for 1993-97 is projected at Y1,000bn rather than the
original Y1,600bn. JAL says this will enable it to break even in the next
financial year, return to profitability in 1994, and restore dividends in
1995. The airline made pre-tax losses of Y6.4bn last year.
Restructuring plans were first announced in June, but deepening losses have
made further action necessary.
JAL blames its difficulties on falling international passenger demand,
particularly from business travellers, and increased competition.
The main target of capital spending cuts will be the introduction of new
aircraft.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Akai makes losses as domestic
sales sink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKAI Electric, the Japanese video and audio equipment maker, yesterday
blamed a Y247m (Dollars 1.97m) pre-tax loss for the year to the end of
November on the collapse of domestic demand for consumer electronics and on
currency fluctuations in the European market.
The Tokyo-based company, which reported a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn in the
previous year, said sales fell 13.5 per cent to Y56.6bn, reflecting the
particularly harsh conditions in the domestic market, where video cassette
recorder output slid 21.4 per cent in the third quarter last year.
During the same quarter, tape recorder output by the Japanese industry fell
24 per cent and that of stereo components was down 5.3 per cent. A record
fall in Tokyo department store sales in December suggests that trading
conditions for consumer electronics makers will get worse before they get
better.
However, Akai is aiming for a 6 per cent increase in sales this year to
Y60bn and a pre-tax profit of Y200m, with increased VCR demand in Europe
expected to compensate for a sales decline in sales in Japan. Increased
demand is not expected until the second half, and the company is forecasting
a first-half loss of Y800m.
Akai said capital spending would be reduced from Y2.6bn last year to about
Y2bn, and the company has announced that it will be more flexible in
choosing components suppliers in an attempt to cut costs.

<TEXT>
BANGKOK Bank, Thailand's largest bank, posted better-than-expected net
profits of Bt10.5bn (Dollars 411m), or Bt10.54 a share, for 1992, against
Bt7.3bn, or Bt8.23, a year ago, Reuter reports from Bangkok.
The bank said the earnings growth could be attributed to a 14.9 per cent
rise in lending during the year, despite sluggish investment by the Thai
private sector.
Mr Mike Stead, an analyst at Union Securities, a local brokerage, said
Bangkok Bank had been expected to net Bt9.9bn profits, or Bt9.90 a share, in
1992.
Mr Damrong Krisnamara, deputy chairman, said the bank was raising its 1992
provision for loan loss reserves to Bt15bn from Bt12bn a year earlier. The
bank would continue to focus on improving the quality of its loans in 1993
with its market share receiving a lower priority.
Mr Chatri Sophonpanich, executive chairman, said the bank was seeking to
expand its foreign business especially in Indochina and China, to boost its
position as a big regional bank.

JAPAN Airlines yesterday announced drastic restructuring plans aimed at
reversing pre-tax losses estimated at Y50bn (Dollars 398m) for the year to
March 1993.
Over the next two years the airline plans to cut investment by Y100bn a
year, and costs by Y100bn next year. Total investment for 1993-1997 is now
projected at Y1,000bn rather than the original Y1,600bn. JAL says this will
enable it to break even in the next financial year, return to profitability
in 1994, and restore dividends in 1995. The airline made pre-tax losses of
Y6.4bn last year.
Restructuring plans were first announced in June, but deepening losses have
made further action necessary. JAL blames its difficulties on falling
international passenger demand, particularly from business travellers, and
increased competition.
The main target of capital spending cuts will be the introduction of new
aircraft. The scheduled acquisition of 25 Boeing 747-400s will be delayed,
but five smaller-capacity Boeing 767s will be added to 35 other aircraft
already on firm order. Cuts in ground investment include three large
airport-based projects, and leasing rather than buying information systems.
JAL aims to decrease its reliance on international traffic revenues from 70
per cent to 60 per cent over the next four years by increasing its share of
the domestic flight market to at least one-third.
Withdrawal from some unprofitable international routes and increased
capacity to more popular destinations, such as Shanghai, Hawaii and Rome are
also planned.
The airline said personnel would be further reduced, after about 400 jobs
cuts last year, but gave no indication of the scale of possible cuts. The
hiring of ground staff, which was halved in this financial year, will be
frozen in 1994.

MICROSOFT, the leading publisher of personal computer software, posted a
34.9 per cent improvement in second-quarter net income to Dollars 236m, or
78 cents, on revenues which jumped 37.5 per cent to Dollars 938m.
Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said record sales of the Windows
operating system contributed to the results. 'Applications sales for the
Apple Macintosh and for the Windows operating system were at record levels,'
he said.
A year earlier, Microsoft had net income of Dollars 175m, or 60 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 682m.
For the first six months, Microsoft had net income of Dollars 445m, or
Dollars 1.48, on revenues of Dollars 1.76bn, against net earnings of Dollars
319m, or Dollars 1.10, on revenues of Dollars 1.26bn.
Microsoft has restated last year's earnings per share to reflect a
three-for-one stock split in June 1992.
Apple Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday unveiled a
2.3 per cent decline in first-quarter net income to Dollars 161.3m, or
Dollars 1.33 a share, but sales, reflecting strong demand, hit record levels
of Dollars 2bn.
The company had steered analysts towards lowering their 1993 estimates, and
the results were roughly in line with average expectations of earnings at
Dollars 1.32 a share.
A year earlier, Apple had net income of Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.36 a
share. Revenues rose 7.5 per cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.86bn.
Sales volume of Apple's Macintosh personal computers rose 31 per cent in the
quarter.
Apple said its gross margin fell to 40.3 per cent of net sales in the three
months, compared with 43.7 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive, attributed the decline to new
product introductions and pricing actions taken on older products in
response to industry conditions.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files shelf
registration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered
a fresh indication of its determination to reduce its debt burden when it
said it had filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to raise as much as Dollars 2bn.
Although such shelf registrations are commonplace among US companies, Time
Warner said that the net proceeds from the sale of up to Dollars 2bn of debt
securities - to be sold from time to time depending on market conditions -
would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock or bank debt.
In particular, the company said some of the proceeds might be used to
repurchase or redeem its Dollars 6.5bn of Series C or Series D preferred
stock. The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in
dividend payments, was issued as a result of the 1989 merger agreement
between Time and Warner.
Yesterday's shelf registration came just a week after Time Warner launched a
fully underwritten Dollars 1bn debenture issue also aimed at reducing its
preferred stock.
That move followed the company's recent statements that it could sell up to
Dollars 3bn of non-strategic assets over the next couple of years to lower
its debt load, which now totals Dollars 9bn.
On Wall Street, yesterday Time Warner's share price was Dollars  1/8 higher
at Dollars 32 1/8 at the close of trading.

DIGITAL Equipment yesterday unveiled better-than-expected second-quarter
results, with losses narrowing as the computer manufacturer cut costs and
restructured its operations.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 73.9m, compared with a net loss of
Dollars 155.2m in the second quarter of fiscal 1992. Operating revenues of
Dollars 3.7bn were up 6 per cent from Dollars 3.5bn on a year ago.
Losses per share amounted to 57 cents, against Dollars 1.25, but Wall Street
analysts had predicted losses of around 86 cents per share. Digital's share
price rose Dollars 7 3/8 on news of the results to trade at Dollars 42 1/4
at the close.
Net losses for the first half were Dollars 334.4m, against a loss of Dollars
629.1m last time, which included a Dollars 485.5m charge for a change in
accounting for retirement health benefits. Total operating revenues for the
period were Dollars 7bn, up 3 per cent from Dollars 6.8bn last year. Per
share results were a Dollars 2.60 loss, against a loss of Dollars 5.05.
'We are encouraged with our progress toward the transformation of Digital,'
said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive.
Mr Palmer recently announced plans to restructure the company into nine
business units.
'Beginning in fiscal year 1994, these business units will have all of
Digital's worldwide profit responsibility,' Mr Palmer said yesterday.
Mr William Steul, vice-president and chief financial officer said: 'While we
were encouraged by our improvement in overall operating results compared
with last year, results from some countries outside the US remained soft.
Given the economic uncertainties worldwide, our outlook remains cautious.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank of New York profits climb
sharply to Dollars 369m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of New York, a large and conservatively-managed commercial bank,
turned in net profits of Dollars 369m, or Dollars 4.23 a share, for 1992, up
sharply from Dollars 122m, or Dollars 1.28, in 1991. Earnings were helped by
stronger fee income, wider interest spreads and lower bad debt provisions.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 1992 was Dollars 104m (Dollars 1.14 per
share), up from Dollars 66m, or 80 cents. Return on equity was 12.42 per
cent.
Bank of New York's acquisition of the branch business of Barclays Bank of
New York was completed last December 11, providing a small contribution to
earnings. The Barclays purchase added Dollars 54m to non-performing assets,
but the net total of such assets declined by Dollars 96m last year to
Dollars 931m.
Bank of New York's bad debt provisions in 1992 were Dollars 427m, down from
Dollars 746m in 1991.
On Wall Street, its share price was Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 55 1/8 at
the close.
First Chicago turned in fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 136.6m, or
Dollars 1.53, compared with a Dollars 15.1m loss in the corresponding
quarter of 1991. Earnings for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 93.5m, down
from Dollars 116.3m the previous year.
Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said the level of non-performing assets
declined to Dollars 414m, the lowest since 1985, and commercial credit
quality was improving.
Bad debt provisions for 1992 were Dollars 425m, down from Dollars 440m. The
bank's return on its Dollars 49.3bn of assets in 1992 was just 0.17 per
cent, even lower than the 0.22 per cent a year before.
In New Jersey, First Fidelity said its 1992 net earnings were 41.8 per cent
higher at Dollars 313.7m. The bank's fourth-quarter net profit was 54.9 per
cent better at Dollars 89.6m, while the return on assets was 1.15 per cent.
The New Jersey bank, which has been hit in the past by heavy commercial real
estate loan losses, has embarked on a recovery campaign. But Mr Tony
Terracciano, chairman, said: 'We have come only part way in our efforts to
bring the company to its full earnings potential.'
In Florida, Barnett Banks, one of the biggest in the state, said its
fourth-quarter net income fell to just Dollars 6.2m in 1992 from Dollars
44.1m the previous year because of a Dollars 92.6m restructuring write-off
that resulted from its merger last month with First Florida.
For the whole of 1992 Barnett earned Dollars 207.7m of net profit, up
sharply from Dollars 81.4m in 1991.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zale agrees reorganisation
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZALE Corporation, the largest jewellery retailer in the US but operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January 1992, is believed to
have reached agreement on a reorganisation plan with all its leading
creditors.
The company's efforts to haul itself out of Chapter 11 had run into problems
with the creditors of its credit unit, Zale Credit Corporation.
Under bankruptcy procedure, the reorganisation scheme must be approved by
the courts. Full details of the plan were not available immediately, but it
is understood to involve a debt-for-equity swap by creditors.
One party involved in the matter suggested that Zale could emerge from
Chapter 11 by the second quarter of 1993.
Zale's equity is largely owned by Peoples Jewellers, based in Toronto, and
Swarovski International Holding, a vehicle for the wealthy Austrian family.
It was unclear if existing shareholders would get anything in the
reorganisation.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P credit warning for US
carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, one of the large Wall Street rating agencies, yesterday
placed the debt securities of the three largest US carriers on creditwatch
with a view to downgrading them. The companies are AMR, parent of American
Airlines, UAL, parent of United, and Delta Air Lines.
The rating agency said the creditwatch listings were based on adverse
industry and competitive developments that have worsened an already negative
credit outlook.
S&amp;P cited the prevalance of foreign investment in second-tier US carriers,
which was allowing these airlines to maintain operations and 'potentially
pose more significant competition'.
Air Canada, for example, planned to invest in Houston-based Continental
Airlines, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines planned to integrate operations
with Northwest Airlines.
S&amp;P pointed to the continued operation of bankrupt carriers, which were
prolonging industry overcapacity caused by weak demand and over-aggressive
aircraft orders.

</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDBANK yesterday became the latest Swedish bank to seek government
support, in a further indication of the extent of the crisis facing the
country's financial sector.
The bank, which claims to be the largest bank in the Nordic countries after
being formed from 11 savings banks, said it was worried that continuing
recession in the Swedish economy would put it in breach of international
capital adequacy requirements during 1993.
Mr Goran Collert, Swedbank managing director, also warned the bank's 1992
deficit could be even greater than the SKr8.5bn (Dollars 1.1bn) predicted
last October when credit losses for the year were anticipated to total
SKr14.5bn. 'It could be another SKr1bn more,' he stated.
Swedbank had already warned it might have to seek state support if the
economic outlook did not improve.
Its decision to seek discussions with the Finance Ministry means Svenska
Handelsbanken is the only leading Swedish bank not to be inquiring about or
already receiving state support.
In the first eight months of 1992, Swedbank suffered an operating loss of
SKr6.5bn, after loan losses rose to SKr10.4bn. Its capital adequacy ratio
stands at around 8.5 per cent, but is likely to fall below 8 per cent this
year without an economic upturn.

PEAK US timber prices, a sharply lower Canadian dollar and strengthening
demand for most papers are bringing back some optimism in the battered
Canadian forest products industry.
A restructured Fletcher Challenge Canada, the first integrated group to
report for the final quarter of 1992, says a significant turnround is under
way. The company is 72 per cent-owned by Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand.
In the second quarter to December 31, it lost CDollars 4.8m (USDollars
3.2m), or 6 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 17.2m, or 28 cents,
a year earlier which included a CDollars 35m net gain on an asset sale.
Sales were CDollars 263m, against CDollars 250m.
The first-half loss was CDollars 23.6m, or 30 cents a share, against a small
profit equal to 1 cent a share a year earlier after the special gain. Sales
were CDollars 470m, against CDollars 502m.
The figures mask a significant turnround, said the company. For instance,
newsprint shipments in the second quarter were up 49 per cent and coated
papers 11 per cent.
Overall, the industry is expected to post total losses of nearly CDollars
1bn for all 1992, against a loss of CDollars 2.5bn in 1991. It shipped 75
per cent of its products to the US.
Price increases are likely in the second quarter of 1993 and inventories
will tighten.
Timber prices have soared with rising US housing starts and some mills are
calling back workers to raise output.

FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Motorola lifted by record fourth
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA'S share price rose sharply yesterday on record fourth-quarter sales
and earnings, driven by strong growth in the US electronics manufacturer's
communications and semiconductor businesses.
The share price was Dollars 6 5/8 higher at Dollars 119 before the close in
New York.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 181m, or Dollars 1.35 a share,
compared with Dollars 126m, or 96 cents, a year ago. Revenues were Dollars
3.71bn, up 22 per cent from Dollars 3.04bn in the corresponding period a
year ago.
Net earnings for the year were Dollars 453m, or Dollars 3.39, after a
Dollars 123m charge for accounting changes related to retirement benefits,
compared with Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.44, last time. Sales increased 17
per cent to Dollars 13.3bn from Dollars 11.3bn in 1991.
Worldwide demand for Motorola's products and services continued to grow in
the fourth quarter said Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive.
'While economic conditions remain uncertain in Europe and Japan, robust
growth should continue in Asia Pacific markets.
'We expect North America to continue the modest recovery from the 1990-91
recession.'
Motorola said its semiconductor sales increased 22 per cent to Dollars
4.48bn in 1992. In communications, sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 4.14bn.
The Government Electronics Group's sales fell 8 per cent to Dollars 650m.
The group recorded an operating loss, compared with a profit a year ago
which stemmed from increased investments in the proposed Iridium global
communications system.
Motorola's computer business, which has been a weak performer in recent
years, increased sales by 7 per cent to Dollars 625m.
The group posted an operating profit, compared with a loss a year ago.

<TEXT>
HILTON Hotels, the California-based lodging and gaming company, yesterday
reported a 23 per cent improvement in after-tax profits during 1992, to
Dollars 103.9m. The advance was largely due to better results from the
casino side, with the hotels turning in a flat performance.
Overall, the company posted operating profits of Dollars 219.9m for the
year, a 19 per cent improvement. Within this, however, the gaming division -
boosted by the purchase of the Reno Hilton at the end of July - made Dollars
153.4m, up from Dollars 115m, while the hotels side posted operating profits
of Dollars 91.5m, slightly lower than the previous year's Dollars 92.9m.
Total revenues were Dollars 1.23bn, an 11 per cent advance.
During the fourth quarter, net profits were Dollars 26.5m, down from Dollars
29.6m in the same period of 1991. Operating profits were marginally higher
at Dollars 56.4m, but although the gaming division showed a 33 per cent
operating profit improvement, the hotels slipped by 6 per cent.
Yesterday, Hilton said it continued to see 'weak conditions in certain key
markets', on the hotel front, and average room rates were lower than in 1991
'due to competitive conditions'.
Hotel occupancy for 1992, however, increased to 66 per cent - a couple of
percentage points higher than in 1991.
On the gaming side, the company was much more optimistic.
The Nevada property saw occupancy rise from 85 per cent to 87 per cent, with
an increase from 81 to 86 per cent in the final quarter.
Hilton said it planned to spend Dollars 246m on expansion and renovation of
properties in Nevada during the next two years and estimated the cost of its
gaming riverboat venture in Kansas City - which is still subject to approval
by local residents - at Dollars 75m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tabacalera considers sale of food unit to
Nabisco
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TABACALERA, Spain's state-controlled tobacco company, is negotiating the
sale of Royal Brands, its food and agribusiness division, to RJR Nabisco in
a move which may foreshadow the US multinational's return to the European
food sector.
Tabacalera said Nabisco had made a firm offer of Pta17bn (Dollars 147m) for
50 per cent of Royal Brands. Tabacalera had suggested it buy the food
division outright. Nabisco would not confirm this, though company executives
were in Madrid yesterday to examine Royal Brands. But Tabacalera said there
were other potential buyers for the food division.
One was United Biscuits of Britain, which recently formed a joint sales
company with Royal Brands in Spain anddelivered a letter of intent three
months ago expressing interest in the company.
UB said it had learned of Nabisco's approach on Tuesday and would be
interested in buying Royal Brands' biscuit interests. These include Spain's
leading biscuit brands and represent about 40 per cent of Royal Brands'
sales, which also cover baking products, desserts and fruit juices.
Royal Brands reported profits of Pta2.7bn last year on sales of Pta27bn.
Nabisco's interest in re-entering European food manufacturing surprised
industry observers. The company sold its extensive operations in the late
1980s to pay off debts used to finance a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm. Tabacalera spent Pta53bn on
some Nabisco units which now form the core of Royal Brands.
Some analysts and food industry executives said buying Royal Brands would
only make commercial sense if Nabisco planned to assemble a Europe-wide food
business through further acquisitions.
However, the cost would be high and was likely to exceed the near-term
resources of Nabisco, which still has outstanding debts of about Dollars
14bn.
Equally surprising is Tabacalera's decision to sell at a time when Royal
Brands is becoming a steady revenue earner and emblem of the state
conglomerate's attempt to diversify away from its core tobacco business.
Analysts said one motive could be to build a war chest to finance a bid for
Ebro, the domestic sugar and rice producer being sold by Grupo Torras, the
troubled investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office.

AN INVESTIGATING judge at Spain's senior monetary court has revoked an order
forcing Banco Santander to post a Pta8bn (Dollars 70.7m) bond as surety
against possible fraud charges.
Judge Miguel Moreiras, who ordered the bond on December 23, upheld an appeal
by the bank against the surety but said he would continue investigating an
alleged tax avoidance loan assignment instrument promoted by Santander
between 1986 and 1989.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the lossmaking Italian tyres and cables group, has taken a further
step in its financial recovery with the sale of a large part of its property
interests.
The company has raised over L190bn (Dollars 138m) by disposing of much of
the land in its Tecnocity property development project. The sale should
realise an extraordinary gain of around L80bn in the 1992 accounts.
Tecnocity, also known as Bicocca, involves derelict land next to one of
Pirelli's manufacturing and office complexes on the outskirts of Milan. The
plant, still occupied in making cables, used to be one of Pirelli's biggest
manufacturing sites before production was shifted to more modern facilities.
Pirelli said the extraordinary gain would in part be set off against
unspecified extraordinary losses or other negative items in its 1992
accounts. The group has been involved in a big restructuring programme, with
substantial job losses and some plant closures.
The Tecnocity site, which won outline planning approval late last year after
lengthy bureaucratic delays, has been split into 11 lots. Each will be
developed by a separate company. Milano Centrale Immobiliare, a property
development group associated with Pirelli, will have an average 26 per cent
stake in each.
Milan Centrale Immobiliare, which recently established a closer relationship
with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the UK property consulting group, is owned by
Pirelli &amp; C, the ultimate holding company for Pirelli.
No financial projections have been revealed for the Tecnocity scheme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS BANK Corporation (SBC) is making an agreed share exchange bid for
Hypothekar-und Handelsbank Winterthur (Hypobank), a quoted regional bank
based in Winterthur, worth about SFr122m (Dollars 85.3m).
The bid, the latest in a series of takeovers in the overcrowded Swiss
banking sector, reflects the growing pressure on small banks dependent on
depressed domestic commercial and property business.
Last week, in the biggest acquisition to date, CS Holding, the parent
company of Credit Suisse, launched an agreed share exchange worth SFr1.5bn
for Swiss Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth-largest bank.
SBC, the second-largest bank, said then it did not seek to expand its
domestic retail presence massively and so had not made a bid for Volksbank.
But it would consider opportunities in regions where it was weak. This, it
said yesterday, was the case in north-east Switzerland, where Hypobank was
active.
Hypobank, in which Winterthur Insurance has a 77 per cent stake, has assets
of SFr1.53bn and, at end-1991, reported net equity of SFr107m. Profits
plunged in 1991 to SFr100,000 from SFr6m, and SBC said yesterday it made a
small profit last year.
Final terms of the offer to all shareholders are to be set by accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, but SBC expects it to be at the rate of three of its
bearer shares for each of the 125,000 Hypobank bearer shares. SBC bearer
shares closed yesterday up SFr1 to SFr326.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Commerzbank improves 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG TRADING during the last two months of 1992 helped Commerzbank, the
third-largest of Germany's big banks, to increase its total operating
profits by 20 per cent last year to approximately DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.38bn).
Partial operating profits - which exclude a contribution from the bank's
own-account trading activity - increased by 15 per cent to approximately
DM2.07bn from DM1.8bn in 1991, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the chief executive,
revealed. Net interest income climbed by 10 per cent from DM4.2bn in 1991.
The figures, ahead of brokers' expectations, are not normally available
until March or April but have been released early to support the bank's
long-expected rights issue, announced earlier this week. Commerzbank is
raising DM500m via a 1-for-11 rights issue at DM200 a share.
Mr Kohlhaussen gave no figures for net profits, calculated after provisions
for bad and doubtful debts. However, he said that it would be inappropriate
to raise the 1992 dividend from the DM10 a share paid in 1991 and that the
priority would be to increase provisions.
Provisions on former Soviet debt will be increased from the current level of
60 per cent to the level of other bank's provisions, likely to be about 80
per cent. The bank will be providing against its exposure to the Olympia &amp;
York property group - which stands at DM530m - and Hafnia, the troubled
Danish insurance company, where the exposure is DM300m.
'The result was so good last year that it allows us to make provisions so
that we will no longer be affected by these cases this year,' Mr Kohlhaussen
said.
He said that the bank had only minimal exposure to Klockner-Werke, the steel
company which last month filed for protection against creditors - and no
exposure to any sizeable corporate problem cases in Germany.
In spite of the worsening economy, Mr Kohlhaussen said he was confident
about the current year's trading. He argued that it was not necessarily the
case that the quality of loan business would deteriorate: there was evidence
of high-quality companies borrowing from the bank again where in more
prosperous times they could finance themselves through cash-flow.
The rights issue was planned for last September but was postponed due to
turbulent market conditions. The decision had been taken to raise the cash
to remove uncertainty from the share price over the timing of the issue -
and because of uncertainties facing the German stock market, Mr Kohlhaussen
explained.
He thought the positive impact of a cut in interest rates by the Bundesbank
could be offset by poor corporate news and the worsening of the economy.
Mr Kohlhaussen rejected suggestions that the bank was forced to hold the
issue in order to comply with new capital adequacy rules which took effect
at the beginning of the year. The bank complied with the rules fully as at
end December and the extra cash would strengthen the bank.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rhone-Poulenc again cuts profit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French state-owned chemicals group scheduled for partial
privatisation by the end of the month, yesterday estimated that operating
profits rose between 5 per cent and 10 per cent last year and that net
earnings would also rise.
The announcement, the third time Rhone-Poulenc has downgraded its 1992
operating profits forecast, comes a fortnight before the February 1 deadline
which the government has set itself to sell to the public at least 6m
Rhone-Poulenc shares, 10.6 per cent of the total.
Company forecasts for growth in operating profits this year have already
been halved from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. By mid-morning, Rhone-Poulenc
investment certificates - or non-voting shares - had fallen to FFr516 and
ended the day down FFr15 at FFr511.
Analysts in London were divided about the implications of the announcement.
Some believed it had effectively released all available information in
preparation for the share sale. However, Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst
at Nikko Europe, said it was possible market conditions were such that the
government could postpone the issue.
The lowest price is set by a Comite d'Evaluation des Entreprises Publiques,
a body which ensures the government receives a fair price for its shares.
The lowest price is unknown, but some analysts believe it could be about
FFr500.
Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director, said the end of the year had
been difficult for chemicals because of the fall of the dollar and delays in
purchases of agrochemicals by farmers, fearful of the consequences of
European Community agriculture policy reform. Elf Aquitaine, the French
state-owned oil group, recently revealed that its fertiliser sales had
suffered from the same effect.
Rhone-Poulenc's net profits should rise in 1992, thanks to more asset sales
than expected and a fall in debt servicing costs, Mr Tirouflet told Le
Figaro newspaper. The group sold FFr4bn (Dollars 740m) of assets last year,
FFr1bn more than its initial forecast, on which it made a FFr1bn capital
gain. He estimated debts fell to less than 80 per cent of shareholders'
funds by the end of 1992 and said Rhone-Poulenc was holding to its objective
of cutting gearing to 50 per cent by 1994.
Net distributable profits fell by 21.4 per cent to FFr1.11bn in the first
nine months of 1992, or declined by 2.6 per cent before payments to
preferred shareholders. Net profits in 1991 rose by 3 per cent to just over
FFr2bn.
Mr Tirouflet expected group operating profits to rise again this year,
despite the fact that Rhone-Poulenc is expecting economic conditions to get
worse.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Fourth-quarter fall at J P Morgan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP MORGAN, the blue-chip New York banking group, was hurt in the fourth
quarter by a decline in trading revenues caused by losses on mortgage-backed
securities.
Although the bank has consistently turned in results that are above the
industry average over the past year - and yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent
rise in its 1992 full-year net profits to Dollars 1.38bn - the fall in
fourth-quarter trading income triggered a drop in Morgan's share price on
Wall Street.
The share price fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 62 yesterday morning after
the bank said its fourth-quarter trading result was Dollars 200m, sharply
lower than the Dollars 313m recorded in the third quarter of 1992 and below
the Dollars 245m achieved in the last quarter of 1991.
The losses in mortgage-backed securities trading also affected trading
revenues for the whole of 1992, which were Dollars 959m, down from Dollars
1.297bn the year before.
Overall net profits for the fourth quarter of 1992 rose by 11 per cent
year-on-year to Dollars 298m, well below market expectations. This
translates into earnings per share of Dollars 1.48 in the quarter, 13 cents
higher year-on-year.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, said the bank's performance last year was
helped especially by corporate finance and securities underwriting
contributions. JP Morgan is one of the few US banks allowed by authorities
to enter the equities market.
Sir Dennis said there was also steady profits growth in credit-related,
investment management and operational service divisions of JP Morgan.
Earnings per share for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 6.92, compared with
Dollars 5.80 in 1991. Bad debt provisions for 1992 were just Dollars 55m, up
from Dollars 40m the year before but extremely low for a big US bank.
Return on equity was high at 22 per cent for the year and 18 per cent for
the fourth quarter. JP Morgan also added Dollars 1bn during the year to its
net equity base, which totalled Dollars 7.1bn at the end of the year.
Net interest revenues for 1992 were 15 per cent up at Dollars 224m while
corporate finance revenues rose by 32 per cent last year to Dollars 439m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Administrator considers sale of Macmillan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, administrators to the Maxwell Communication Corporation
plans to push ahead with investigating the possibility of a private sale of
Macmillan, the US publisher, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Last year Price Waterhouse said it planned to sell the non-publishing
interests of MCC including the Official Airline Guides. The process of
selling OAG is now into the second round. Those interested include Reed
Elsevier, the international publishing group.
Although a sale of Macmillan was never ruled out Price Waterhouse had
previously suggested that a flotation towards the end of next year was more
likely.
Mr Mark Homan, senior joint administrator said yesterday it had always been
intended to consider a sale of Macmillan 'within the framework of a
potential public offering'.
'In recent weeks both we and our US advisers JP Morgan have been inundated
with expressions of interest in Macmillan and in Official Airline Guides,'
Mr Homan said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Microgen rises 13% to Pounds 8.24m - Cost
controls and lower interest charges behind improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROGEN Holdings, the Windsor-based specialist computer services group,
yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to
Pounds 8.24m.
The improvement, up from last time's Pounds 7.28m, was helped by cost
cutting, price increases and substantially lower interest charges.
Turnover for the year to October 31 rose 3 per cent to Pounds 49.3m (Pounds
47.7m).
At the previous year-end the group acknowledged that costs and capital
expenditure had been allowed to run ahead of income during the recession.
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 13.8p (12.2p). A final
dividend of 5.05p (4.8p) makes a 7.25p (7p) total.
Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said he was 'quite pleased' with the overall
advance, achieved against a background of 'relatively stable conditions in
Germany, but continuing severe recession in the UK, Ireland and
Scandinavia.'
In particular he cited the 'outstanding achievement' of the group's
Scandinavian operations.
These now accounted for a third of turnover and 29 per cent of pre-tax
profits and managed to boost sales despite the recession, although margins
on new business were somewhat lower.
Mr Lee said three main factors explained the profit gain.
Costs in the UK, including personnel, had been reduced to produce Pounds 1m
of savings in a full year, a price review of smaller accounts led to prices
being raised, producing an additional Pounds 400,000, and the cash position
has improved significantly.
At the end of October the balance sheet held net cash of Pounds 3m, compared
to net borrowings of Pounds 1m a year earlier, after paying Pounds 1.1m in
October to acquire a computer output microfilm (Com) and electronic printing
business in Denmark.
Microgen's core Com business currently accounts for about 70 per cent of
turnover, down from 78 per cent a year ago.
It is a mature market which is being slowly eroded by new technologies like
optical storage.
However, Mr Lee said the group was confident that Com 'has a long and secure
future.' Specialist services based around electronic printing, like 'demand
publishing', are expected to provide most of the growth in the future. t

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure slips but detects signs of
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANLEY Leisure Org-anisation, the betting shop, casino and snooker club
group, yesterday reported a slight drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.73m
to Pounds 3.53m in the six months to November 1.
The group also said it had recently detected the first signs of a recovery
in spending due to lower interest rates.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said: 'People don't want to be miserable.
They want to go out and spend it', but he added that high levels of
unemployment were likely to prove a continuing restraint on confidence.
The profits setback was struck from turnover 8 per cent ahead at Pounds
108.5m.
Mr Steinberg said the period was the worst he had experienced in 38 years in
the gaming industry.
He added: 'We believe that while the recession is not yet over, a slow
upturn has started. As a result, we remain confident and look forward to the
next financial year with a degree more optimism than previously'.
Stanley will have more than 350 betting shops after next month's completion
of its acquisition of 26 Surrey Racing betting shops in Scotland for Pounds
2.99m.
During the half year, the racing division showed a slight improvement, but
this was mainly due to turnover from acquisitions, and the average stake per
slip increased only marginally, from Pounds 3.38 to Pounds 3.42p. Gross
margins were slightly down, after a run of unfavourable results during the
summer.
Stanley's 17 provincial casinos, which contribute about half of group
profits, saw a slight fall in turnover, coupled with an improvement in
margin. The spend per head was flat at Pounds 84.
Mr Steinberg said: 'Trading has improved since the half-year, with the
casino division showing greater signs of an upturn. Betting turnover had
also improved, but margins are under some pressure.'
Earnings per share were down from 5.82p to 5.48p.
The interim dividend is held at 1.52p.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hampson edges ahead to Pounds 1.69m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS before tax at Hampson Industries, the precision engineering,
aluminium and home products group, edged up in the first half, but Mr John
Wardle, the chairman, yesterday warned shareholders to expect low dividend
payments.
In the six months to end-September, pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.69m,
compared with Pounds 1.62m, on turnover down from Pounds 37.1m to Pounds
35.4m. Fully diluted earnings per share came out at 1.5p (1.45p).
However, apart from the 4 per cent profit increase, there is, Mr Wardle
said, 'very little other good news to communicate.'
As 'a precautionary measure', Hampson is cutting back its interim dividend
from 0.6p to 0.4p. 'As the interim dividend is only slightly over a quarter
of the total dividends paid for the last two years, this should be taken as
an indication that a maintained final dividend can by no means be taken for
granted,' Mr Wardle said.
Last September, announcing a final 1991-92 dividend of 1.773p, Mr Wardle
said that this year the dividend would not be cut.
The change in policy stems from determination to build up retained profits.
This is related to the need for more investment, especially in Hampson's
precision engineering business.
Precision engineering's contribution to group operating profits has climbed
to 60 per cent from 46 per cent at the end of the 1990-91 financial year.
The strength of the business, where there is a record order book for
aircraft maintenance, has led to the need for improved production
facilities.
Hampson's problems, which have contributed to the caution on dividend
policy, relate rather to the other parts of the business.
The sterling devaluation gave margins in the furniture business a wounding
blow because of the use of imported supplies: the pain will not be eased
until the products have been redesigned and their materials re-sourced.
Double-glazing activities, given the depression in the construction
industry, are at best sluggish. Aluminium prices have been low, but they
improved in the second half.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: First Spanish net asset value lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sudden downturn in the property and construction sectors at a time when
those sectors had been over-weighted in its portfolio left net asset value
at First Spanish Investment Trust at 67.5p at November 30.
That represented a fall of 14 per cent from the 78.6p of six months earlier.
At November 30 1991 nav was 72.2p.
The company said that with the peseta at a more competitive level the omens
for the Spanish stock market, which was undervalued compared with other
European markets, appeared favourable.
Net revenue for the six months to the end of November was Pounds 293,000
(Pounds 270,000) for earnings per share of 0.83p (0.76p).
The main objective of the trust is capital appreciation and no interim
dividend will be paid. However, it intended to propose a final dividend for
the year to May 31, the first payment since that for the 1989-90 year.

Net revenue increased from Pounds 790,000 to Pounds 3.27m, helped by

The trust said that this income would not recur and recommended a dividend
which could be maintained in the present year; the proposed final is

Coats Viyella, the textiles group, has been granted an option to purchase
Jaykeel Investments' holding of 8.68m shares in Youghal Carpets, which

Youghal has suffered worsening losses in recent years. Pre-tax losses were
IPounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.9m) in 1991 and in the first half of 1992 it lost a
further IPounds 2.05m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEOTRONICS Technology, a maker of specialist gas and water analysis
equipment, raised pre-tax profits by 16 per cent, from Pounds 2.62m to
Pounds 3.03m, in the year to September 30, writes Matthew Curtin.
The outcome was ahead of market expectations and the shares rose 8p to 161p
.
Turnover jumped to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 16.1m) with higher sales in the US,
EC and Australia driven by legislation demanding tighter environmental and
safety standards in industry. Operating profits were Pounds 3.12m (Pounds
2.65m).
Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said the results were underpinned by emphasis on
research and development - spending on which increased from Pounds 1m to
Pounds 1.37m.
He said the greatest longer-term potential lay with Solomat Instrumentation,
the group's water quality analysis subsidiary acquired in January last year.
The re-organisation and integration of Solomat was complete, and although
regulations controlling the water industry worldwide were still in their
infancy, new legislation in the EC and US would spur demand for Solomat's
products.
Earnings per share improved to from 7.26p to 7.65p and the proposed final
dividend is increased to 1.75p making a 2.6p (2.52p) total.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale falls Pounds 494,000 into red and
buys 80% stake in consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIRKDALE group, which runs a range of marketing, advertising and public
relations agencies, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 494,000 for the six
months ended September 30.
That compared with profits of Pounds 64,000 previously and was struck from
turnover down almost 10 per cent at Pounds 9.5m.
Losses per share emerged at 2.9p (earnings of 0.5p). The group's net average
debt currently stands at Pounds 1m.
The fall in turnover was largely in line with the results across most of the
advertising and marketing sector, as the recession hit budgets everywhere.
Mr Neil McClure, managing director, said that far from losing clients the
group had in fact gained new business, with prestigious accounts from
British Airways (for its international recruitment advertising), Cunard,
Cadbury and elsewhere.
However, the recession meant that existing and new clients had tightened all
budgets, including marketing.
'At the moment we can see some signs of a recovery but all we can say so far
is that 1993 is not going to be worse than 1992,' he added.
The group had cut staff levels by about 9 per cent to 270 in the past six
months and board directors had taken pay cuts of 20 per cent; Mr Richard
Humphreys, chief executive, takes no salary from the group.
Mr McClure said that the group's emphasis had been on maintaining itself in
good financial and creative shape in order to take advantage of the
recovery, when it arrives.
He also reported the acquisition by Birkdale of 80 per cent of the shares of
MSL, the London-based marketing consultancy, for a maximum consideration of
Pounds 365,000, financed by Birkdale shares and a one-year deferred payment.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: 3i raises Pounds 24.6m from sale of trust
stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i GROUP, the venture capital company, has sold its holdings in two
publicly-quoted investment trusts, London Atlantic Investment Trust and
North British Canadian Investment Company, for Pounds 24.6m after costs.
This represents the second largest disposal of an investment - after the
sale of a Pounds 38m stake in the Frizzell financial services group  - by 3i
in the past 12 months.
The proceeds will be devoted to its core activity of investment in unquoted
companies.
3i held stakes of 55 per cent stake in London Atlantic and 27.2 per cent in
North British.
It will continue as investment manager for both the trusts, which specialise
in smaller quoted companies, and is still keen to take on the management of
other investment trust portfolios where possible, said Mr Rupert Wiles,
executive director.
3i's portfolio management division still has responsibility for its direct
stakes in quoted companies and for managing the group pension fund - a total
of about Pounds 500m worth of investments.
3i held the stakes for several decades and originally acquired its holdings
so as to have a home for some of its quoted investments. This was no longer
appropriate, Mr Wiles said.
3i has its own much delayed plans to obtain a public listing in investment
trust form.
The disposal involved 25.1m shares in London Atlantic which were placed with
about 20 institutional investors at a discount of 2 per cent to the
mid-market price of 71 1/2 p by stockbrokers James Capel.
Some 7.3m shares in North British were placed with about 10 institutions at
a discount of nearly 4 per cent to the mid-market price of 103p.
London Atlantic has recently traded at a 13 per cent discount to net asset
value and North British at a 9 per cent discount. The sale is expected to
increase liquidity in the stock.
3i still has an 18 per cent stake in the Investment Trust of Guernsey.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life increases new UK life
business by 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 6 per
cent increase in new UK life business for 1992.
However, trends for its two trading arms varied widely. Black Horse
Financial Services, the 'bankassurance' arm which sells only to customers of
Lloyds Bank, saw an increase of 7 per cent to Pounds 66m in regular premiums
and of 34 per cent to Pounds 711m in single premiums.
That was equivalent to a 19 per cent rise, taking the standard industry
yardstick of adding full regular premium business to 10 per cent of single
premiums.
In contrast, Abbey Life Assurance, which distributes most of its products
via a direct sales force, saw regular premium business fall by 11 per cent
to Pounds 82.5m and single premiums rise by only 8 per cent to Pounds
289.5m. Using the adjusted new business yardstick, that was equivalent to a
fall of 6 per cent compared with 1991.
The Abbey Life sales force fell from 3,507 to 3,200. Black Horse's sales
force expanded slightly to 1,005.
Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, said the low regular premium figures were
caused by low consumer confidence, particularly in the second half.
Redundancy pay-outs and early retirements had helped to boost single premium
business.
He added: 'Banks selling assurance, with relatively strong branding and a
customer relationship in place, are always going to have a head start with
the customer.'
Nonetheless, he was confident that Abbey Life, with its strong distribution
power, would survive. He suggested that the increased market share for bank
assurance would be at the expense of small companies operating through
independent brokers, rather than large direct sales forces.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Securicor sharply up at Pounds 54.5m -
Strong growth from Cellnet gives a fillip to outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURICOR, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a
sharp recovery in profits thanks to improved margins and strong growth from
Cellnet, its 40 per cent-owned mobile telephone network.
Pre-tax profits for Securicor increased by 65 per cent, from Pounds 33m to
Pounds 54.5m, in the year to September 30. Profits at Security Services, its
50.75 per cent-owned subsidiary where most of the group's operating
companies are held, showed an 81 per cent improvement, from Pounds 20.4m to
Pounds 37m.
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the improved results partly reflected
cost cutting since 1991. But he said 'there is no room for complacency' in
returning businesses like security and parcels to previous levels of
profitability.
Cellnet, the smaller of the UK's two mobile networks, increased operating
profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 151m in the year to end-September, of which
Securicor's share is some Pounds 60m. Cellnet is 60 per cent-owned by BT and
its financial year runs to the end of March.
Mr Wiggs repeated previous statements that any 'sufficiently attractive'
offer for the Cellnet stake would be put to shareholders. Cellnet's dividend
to Securicor increased 30 per cent to Pounds 13m, he said.
Securicor's turnover increased 3.3 per cent to Pounds 584m. The security
division had a strong second half and the parcel division's sales were
lifted by the acquisition in March of Federal Express's UK business.
The communications division, which excludes Cellnet but includes cellular
retailing, continued to lose money because its subscriber base remains too
small.
Earnings increased 46 per cent to 24.3p per share.
A final dividend of 1.955p is proposed to make a total of 2.62p, an increase
of 12 per cent.
The same increase is proposed at Security Services to make a total of 5.03p.
COMMENT
Securicor's public position on selling its Cellnet stake has not changed,
but analysts detected the company has at least been mulling over what to do
with any proceeds. No sale is expected immediately, and it may be a couple
of years before BT makes the right offer. In the meantime, Securicor's rapid
growth from the depressed levels of 1991 is set to continue. Forecast
profits for this year of Pounds 67m, rising perhaps to Pounds 90m in 1994,
partly explain yesterday's 8p rise in the A shares to 643p, where they are
on a multiple of nearly 20. The company's strange structure, and the
difficulty outsiders face in valuing Cellnet, may hold the shares back, but
they look a reliable longer-term performer.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wyko declines to Pounds 121,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WYKO, the power trans- mission components distribution and manufacturing
group, reported a sharp reduction in first half profits and cut its interim
dividend.
The pre-tax line for the six months to October 31 fell to Pounds 121,000,
after an exceptional Pounds 94,000 related to the sale of Wyko Power Plant
Gears, compared with Pounds 279,000 last time.
Turnover increased from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 29m. Sales on the
distribution side increased, albeit at the cost of slimmer margins, but fell
on the manufacturing side as orders from the process plant industry
declined.
Another problem is the German market, where group subsidiaries fell into
losses. This deficit, against which the group has no offsetting tax relief,
led to a first half tax charge which exceeded pre-tax profits. This resulted
in an attributable loss of Pounds 24,000 and was the main reason for the
paring of the interim dividend to 0.5p (1.4p). Losses per share were 0.07p
(earnings of 0.66p).
Since last October demand has improved and although Mr Philip White,
chairman, is uncertain whether this is 'a false dawn or whether we shall see
some sustained demand' he believes that the second half 'should produce a
more encouraging result.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: City gives a favourable response to TSB
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL YEAR results of TSB may have been unsatisfactory as far as the bank was
concerned, but they received a gratifying response. The news that it had
made a lower-than-expected pre-tax profit of only Pounds 43m - after a bad
debt charge of Pounds 597m - was followed by a jump in the share price.
Investors discerned some underlying encouraging news in TSB's record
operating profit, which rose to Pounds 648m before exceptional items in the
year to October 31.
The good cheer also spread to other bank stocks as the market revised its
expectations of the full-year results to come.
The news was nonetheless well-hidden among other tales of woe in TSB's
figures. It is still suffering a hangover from lending in the late-1980s. It
even split out the figures for its Mortgage Express subsidiary, and bad
loans from its Hill Samuel merchant bank, to make the problems starkly
clear.
The decision to bite the bad lending bullet even harder than last year -
when it became the first bank to incur a significant full-year loss because
of domestic lending - came in October.
That was when TSB's hope of a quick revival in commercial property prices
finally evaporated.
The result was the setting-up of its Loan Administration Unit to take on the
poor lending of Hill Samuel - much of it made in a two-year burst in the
late-1980s.
The unit took on a net Pounds 1.8bn of Hill Samuel lending, which has been
written down to Pounds 917m after making a provision of Pounds 883m - or 49
per cent.
Although property lending makes up Pounds 434m of the total - and is
provisioned at 51 per cent - the unit handles a huge array of bad loans
spread across industrial sectors. Mr Mike Fairey, the bank's credit director
in charge of the unit, describes the property as 'not dreadful, but a mixed
bag'.
The other big headache is Mortgage Express, the centralised mortgage lender
which is being run down. It incurred a loss of Pounds 67m.
Six thousand visits were made to borrowers in arrears last year after the
alternative - an average loss of Pounds 35,000 on selling repossessed homes
 -proved too costly.
The separation of these two businesses leaves Hill Samuel and the
newly-merged retail banking and insurance business to trade with a lighter
load. TSB's long-term profitability - and even whether it survives as an
independent bank - depends on the two divisions producing better returns.
Hill Samuel is starting with a clean sheet. Its Pounds 2.4bn loan portfolio
carries no net bad debt charge because all charges were transferred to the
Loan Administration Unit. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said Hill
Samuel might even be kept clean by the transfer of future bad loans to the
unit.
However, Hill Samuel faces a stiff task in building new and profitable
business. TSB wants it to concentrate on the mid-corporate market -
companies with a net worth of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 500m - and only
lend where cross-selling of other products will boost the return on capital.
The group's future profitability therefore depends above all on retail
banking and insurance.
A firm cost drive this year - which has provoked industrial action - is the
main reason for the improvement in operating profits. But it will also need
to raise revenue markedly in the long term.
Mr Ellwood wants to increase volume by drawing customers to high
interest-bearing accounts. He hopes it can compensate for narrowed margins
in this way. But he acknowledges the size of the challenge.
'The fact is that too many banks are chasing market share, with massive
overlap,' he says.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Promising start for Lifetime package
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellnet's Lifetime package, designed to attract consumer rather than
business users to cellular phones, made a promising start after its November
launch, according to Mr Stafford Taylor, managing director.
By the end of last year, 44,000 new subscribers had signed up for the
service, although 17,000 of these were business subscribers switching to the
new package. This compared with 45,000 new subscribers for Vodafone, the
larger network which started its LowCall service slightly earlier. In
December, when sales were boosted by Christmas, Cellnet's market share
exceeded Vodafone's for the first time in several years.
Cellnet's turnover increased 12 per cent to Pounds 360m in the year to
September 30 while operating profits grew 32 per cent to Pounds 151m, Mr
Taylor said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett named as Dairy Crest broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the milk processing and dairy products subsidiary of the Milk
Marketing Board, has appointed Hoare Govett as the stockbroker to handle its
flotation next year.
The float is expected to give Dairy Crest a market value of about Pounds
500m and raise Pounds 150m of new money.
Schroders has already been appointed as the merchant bank for the issue.
Dairy farmers will have shares in Dairy Crest, a factor which will
complicate the flotation.
The appointment of Hoare Govett, chosen from a number of contenders, gives a
boost to the broker which had suffered from uncertainty of ownership until
it was bought by ABN Amro, the Netherlands bank, last June.
Hoare Govett has recently been appointed broker to Irish Permanent Building
Society.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Intercare to Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERCARE GROUP, the rapidly-expanding healthcare products supplier, more
than doubled its pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.6m in the year
to October 31.
Sales rose from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 29.1m, boosted by contributions from
the group's two most significant recent acquisitions.
SAFA, which distributes occupational health products to corporate customers,
was in for seven months, and Birmingham Optical, which supplies equipment to
opticians, made a six-month contribution. The acquisitions were funded by a
Pounds 5.5m placing and offer last March.
Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said a pleasing aspect of the results was that
profitability of businesses owned for a full year had grown organically by
about 25 per cent.
The group has created a new division which comprises Booster, which makes
electric vehicles for the elderly and disabled, and Montis, its distributor
in the Netherlands. This mobility division saw trading profits grow from
Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 1.9m on sales up from Pounds 2.86m to Pounds 8.69m.
The optical division increased trading profits from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds
891,000 on sales up from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 6.9m. Mr Cowan said the
purchase of Birmingham, a distributor of clinical instrumentation and lenses
to retail opticians, had complemented the original optical business.
The medical products distribution division, which includes A-Z Dental
Holdings, increased trading profits to Pounds 825,000 (Pounds 690,000) on
sales of Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Dental's pre-tax profit was Pounds
252,000 (Pounds 372,000) on sales of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4m).
Gearing is under 6 per cent. Mr Cowan said he expected to be able to
maintain organic growth in excess of 20 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 9.5p (7.5p). A final dividend of 2p gives a total
2.6p (2p), an increase of 30 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jones Stroud advances 32% to Pounds 3.29m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES STROUD (Holdings), the manufacturer of accessories and materials for
the textiles and electrical industries, lifted pre-tax profits by 32 per
cent from Pounds 2.49m to Pounds 3.29m in the six months to September 30.
Mr Philip Jones, chairman, said it was pleasing to report a recovery despite
the difficult trading conditions.
Turnover grew to Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 31.9m) and trading profits were up at
Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 2.72m). This time there were no exceptional charges
(Pounds 123,000 for factory closures). Net interest payable was reduced to
Pounds 19,000 (Pounds 104,000).
Mr Jones said that the recent devaluation of sterling had affected raw
material costs 'at a time when increases are difficult to recover'. He
added, though, that Jones Stroud should also benefit from the concomitant
improved competitiveness in overseas markets.
The interim dividend is lifted by 10 per cent to 3.3p, payable from earnings
up 34 per cent at 12.32p. Mr Philip and Mr David Jones, managing director,
together own 70.05 per cent of the company's equity.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad accused of poor pricing and
confused marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS ACCUSED rival holiday group, Owners Abroad, of having a confused
marketing strategy and poor pricing judgment which had led to a
disappointing financial performance.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, called Owners Abroad's proposed link
with Thomas Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, 'a poison
pill' which was ill-conceived. It was liable to lead to an erosion of value
for Owners Abroad's holders.
In the offer document, posted to shareholders yesterday, Mr Crossland said
an investor who bought Pounds 1,000 of Airtours shares five years ago would
have had an investment worth Pounds 16,500 just before the Pounds 215.4m bid
was launched on January 5. A similar investment in Owners Abroad would have
been worth only Pounds 2,035.
Owners Abroad said it saw little in the Airtours document that it had not
already addressed but it would make a detailed rebuttal today. The company
added that a Pounds 1,000 investment in Airtours on January 5 would now be
worth Pounds 903.
Airtours said that in the 1980s Owners Abroad had embarked upon a 'misguided
policy of brand proliferation' which was now being reversed. Owners Abroad
had 34 brands against Airtours' 16 and the three 'serious' brands sold by
Thomson, the market leader.
Mr Harry Coe, Airtours finance director, said the lack of focus was
exemplified on the Greek Island of Kos where Owners Abroad was selling eight
different holiday brands. An Owners Abroad adviser said that the company was
not over-represented, rather Airtours was under-represented.
Airtours said that Owners Abroad's recent increase in the capacity of its
Air 2000 charter airline left it financially vulnerable to swings in market
demand. A combined group would be able to absorb a significant amount of the
surplus.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for decline at Goode
Durrant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODE DURRANT, the mini-conglomerate with interests in van hire, property
and motor dealerships, reported a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.8m in the half year to October 31.
Turnover fell from Pounds 97.8m to Pounds 90.6m. Northgate, the group's
commercial vehicle hire business, was the only UK operation to improve its
performance, contributing a fifth of sales, but 79 per cent of operating
profits.
Earnings per share were 2.3p (3.5p). The interim dividend is maintained at
2.15p.
Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said the depth of the recession took its
toll on the equipment hire, property, and motor distribution divisions. GDM
Finance, the South African trading finance subsidiary, improved profits
despite difficult local conditions.
There were signs of improving economic activity in the UK - from larger
numbers of customers in car showrooms to now-steady levels of van and
equipment hire, and the group's successful sale of a small office block in
Blackburn in December - but they were 'too tentative' to have much effect on
the results.
The group continued to focus on 'liquid asset management' and was addressing
ways of moving out of the property business.
Last year saw a Pounds 6.27m exceptional provision for property and
land-bank write-downs, which tipped the group into the red.
Mr Graham Perrins, a director of Winnedeal, the South African company owned
by the Nash family which has a 25 per cent hostile stake in the group, said
the results were disappointing. The group was paying the price for expensive
acquisitions in the past, which had led to large goodwill write-offs.
Winnedeal would like to see management take a 'more pro-active' approach to
restructuring the business.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Cray Electronics leap to
Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRAY Electronics Holdings, the Berkshire-based high technology group which
acquired the Dowty information technology division from TI for Pounds 50m in
July, yesterday reported sharply higher turnover and profits for the
first-half and resumed payment of an interim dividend.
Operating profits in the six months to October 31 more than doubled to
Pounds 5.71m, against Pounds 2.77m last time. The latest figure included
Pounds 1.12m attributed to acquisitions and Pounds 787,000 (Pounds 982,000)
from discontinued operations. Turnover increased to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds
40m), including Pounds 8.91m (Pounds 6.93m) from discontinued operations.
Pre-tax profits, including a Pounds 13m profit on disposals and after Pounds
899,000 in net interest payments, jumped to Pounds 17.8m from Pounds 536,000
last time when profits were reduced by Pounds 1.14m in abortive bid costs
and Pounds 1.51m of net interest payments partly offset by a Pounds 410,000
profit on disposals.
Earnings per share came out at 10.33p (0.47p) and an interim dividend of
0.5p is declared.
Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said Cray's outlook had been 'transformed' by
the acquisition of Dowty IT and its subsequent merger with the original
Craycom business to form the new core Cray communications division
comprising four companies based in the UK, US, Denmark and Australia.
He said the results confirmed both the growth achieved by the original Cray
companies and the non-dilutive effect of the Dowty IT acquisition.
At the end of October, having paid for the Dowty IT acquisition mainly
through a Pounds 41.1m rights issue, the group's total debt was about Pounds
7.4m.
Since then the group has sold two non-core busi-nesses and has eliminated
all debt.
COMMENT
The Dowty IT acquisition was a big lump to swallow, but appears to have been
well digested and integrated into the new communications division. The Dowty
businesses generated about Pounds 30m of the first-half revenues and about
Pounds 1.1m of profits. Although margins in the new businesses were slim at
3.7 per cent, the full effect of cost cutting has yet to come through. With
pre-tax profits projected at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 17m this year,
producing earnings of 6.4p a share, the stock is currently trading on a
lofty prospective p/e of 20.9, although this drops to about 16 based on next
years' prospective earnings. Against this Cray is operating in an
increasingly competitive international market, its share price has risen
sharply recently and already commands a premium. Hold.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Windsor shows strong growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite tough trading conditions, Windsor, the specialist sports insurance
broker, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 616,000 for the year to September
30, a sharp recovery from the comparable deficit of Pounds 1.2m, struck
after a Pounds 1m property write-down.
Earnings per share were 1.69p (losses 3.2p).
The group reported strong growth in its core sports business.
Commissions on sport insurance policies account for about 25 per cent of its
operating income which grew on an underlying basis by 10 per cent to Pounds
7m (Pounds 6m).

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Denmans Electrical advances 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Denmans Electrical, the USM-quoted electrical goods group, were
yesterday marked 50p higher in a thin market to 275p after a 21 per cent
profits advance.
On turnover of Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 34.5m), pre-tax profits for the 12
months to September 30 rose from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.52m. Mr Arnold
Denman, chairman, said that stringent cost controls had again contributed to
the improvement in margins.
Recession in the building industry continued to affect the wholesale
business. Profits were again depressed by an exceptionally high level of bad
debts, Mr Denman said.
The Euroelectric importing and distribution side achieved 'significant
growth' in sales and improved profits, while the Eterna Lighting
manufacturing operation reported increased profits despite higher costs from
assimilating new products. These products helped Eterna maintain volumes in
spite of 'severly depressed' traditional markets, he added.
The final dividend is raised to 4.3p making a total of 6.1p (5.85p), covered
just under 4 times by earnings of 23.73p (18.75p) per share.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Recovery year for NatWest Bancorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NatWest Bancorp, the US subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, yesterday
completed a year of recovery from losses by reporting a record fourth
quarter profit after tax of Dollars 50.1m (Pounds 32.9m) compared to a
deficit of Dollars 29.8m the previous year.
The final quarter profit took net income for the year to Dollars 155.7m,
compared to a 1991 loss of Dollars 371.5m.
The loan loss provision for 12 months fell to Dollars 122m (Dollars 567.7m)
after efforts to improve asset quality.
Mr John Tugwell, chairman and chief executive, said he was 'delighted' with
what had been accomplished.
He said the bank had managed to diversify revenue by introducing new
products such as annuities, mutual funds and private banking.
Operating expenses for the year fell to Dollars 782.5m (Dollars 790.8m).

FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rank disappoints with fall to Pounds 230m -
Chief again seeks to counter rumours over sale of film and television
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANK Organisation, the leisure and entertainments group, yesterday
disappointed the City with slightly lower than expected profits of Pounds
230.1m, against Pounds 250.5m last time.
The group also warned that, so far, there had been no sign of an upturn in
UK trading, although there were encouraging signs in the US. Turnover for
the 12 months to October 31 slipped from Pounds 2.11bn to Pounds 2.1bn.
Marketmakers, who had been expecting profits of between Pounds 233m and
Pounds 245m, marked the shares down 17p to 687p following the announcement.
They recovered, however, to close just 9p down at 695p.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, for the second time this week sought to
counter rumours over the sale of the group's film and television interests.
Responding to persistent questions over a possible sale, he replied: 'We are
not in the business of selling our film and television interests and there
the matter rests.'
Analysts continued to speculate, however, that if an offer in excess of
Pounds 400m was made by a reliable bidder from within the industry, Rank
would have to consider it.
Debt was reported higher at Pounds 999.3m (Pounds 960.8m) although,
excluding currency fluctuations, Rank said it had generated a positive cash
flow of Pounds 59m. This was partly due to a series of disposals, such as
motorway services, Rank Screen Advertising and three hotels, which raised
Pounds 150.9m.
Pre-tax profits were hit by a downturn in Rank Xerox and an Pounds 8.1m
(Pounds 1.3m) exceptional debit due to provisions against property values
and redundancy and reorganisation costs.
The return was also depressed by the effects on Rank's holidays and hotels
division of a price war in the travel industry.
Price competition depressed the contribution from Rank Xerox, which fell by
Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 137.3m. Trading had been particularly difficult in
Europe and the Far East. Overall revenue for Rank Xerox, 49 per cent held by
the Rank Organisation, rose by 4 per cent on an underlying basis.
In the holidays and hotels division, trading profits were down 22 per cent
to Pounds 59.6m. This was largely the result of overcapacity in the overseas
holidays market, which led to people taking 'fewer UK holidays or none',
said Mr Gifford. The hotels division, a large part of which is up for sale,
reported record profits out of London.
A Pounds 5m reduction in losses at Rank's video distribution operation in
the US helped the film division report profits some Pounds 8m higher at
Pounds 27.4m. Leisure was 74 per cent higher at Pounds 41.1m, while the
recreation division suffered a 2.6 per cent fall to Pounds 57.8m.
The final dividend is maintained at 20.75p for an unchanged total of 31p
while earnings fell slightly to 37.8p (38.4p).
A Kershaw and Sons, Rank's separately-quoted subsidiary which owns about 10
per cent of the group's share of Rank Xerox, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 9.9m, against Pounds 9.93m last time. The dividend is maintained at
18p for a 27p (same) total.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Exchanges fight for the future across Europe: Tracy Corrigan
on moves behind the intensifying battle for derivatives business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Soros was not the only beneficiary of the unrest in Europe's
financial markets.
He is reputed to have made Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), but Europe's futures
exchanges also benefited as volumes leapt by around 50 per cent last year.
Traders faced with volatile market conditions channelled business away from
cash markets, where prices were no longer being quoted, to more liquid
futures markets.
The surge of volume has exaggerated a steady shift of futures market share
from the mature US market to Europe. The battle to win this business has
created greater competition between Europe's futures and commodity
exchanges, which now number more than 20.
The latest stage in the evolution of Europe's futures markets came on
Wednesday, when France's Matif and Germany's Deutsche Terminborse announced
a co-operation pact which could threaten the dominance of Europe's largest
exchange, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(Liffe).
Although Liffe is in discussions over a link with the Chicago Board of
Trade, it is not in a position to join with other European exchanges,
because most of them are natural competitors. Yet links between other
European exchanges are becoming increasingly common. Last year, four smaller
European exchanges agreed to trade each other's products in order to extend
their reach.
Liffe already offers a broad range of international financial futures and
options contracts, while other exchanges have concentrated mainly on
domestic markets, often imitating existing products on Liffe. The wide
selection of similarly structured contracts on Liffe is considered a source
of strength: during the unrest in the autumn, for example, there was
substantial arbitrage trading between different Liffe products.
Liffe's largest contracts are traded using the traditional open-outcry
system, while the link between the DTB and the Matif will be provided by the
DTB's screen-based trading system.
Many participants believe that, because of the current limitations of
technology, the DTB system will not be able to offer the same level of
liquidity as that available on Liffe.
Certainly, none of the world's largest futures contracts is screen-based. 'I
do not think anyone has found a computerised system which is user-friendly
or simple enough to take the place of open outcry trading,' said Mr Mark
Harding, who heads the financial markets group at Clifford Chance, the law
firm.
'The technology just is not up there yet,' said Mr Alex Cooper, head of
futures at Credit Lyonnais Rouse. 'It will probably be another two
generations (of systems) but we are moving towards synthesised voice output
and touch screen trading.'
However, the trend towards screen-based trading is already gathering steam.
For example, Amsterdam's European Options Exchange decided in December that
it will switch from pit-trading to a combined system of pit and computerised
trading.
In particular, there is a trend for smaller contracts to be shifted to
screen-based systems. 'Pits are not expensive when there is heavy volume,
but they can be expensive for smaller products,' said Mr Gerard Pfaulwadel,
who heads the Matif. Significantly, the Matif's Ecu contract, which will
move to the DTB system, currently trades around 4,000 contracts a day,
compared with a daily volume of around 150,000 in the French government bond
contract. The French bond contract will continue to be traded in the pit.
Last June, Globex, the international after-hours screen trading system, was
finally launched after five years of development by the CME, CBOT and
Reuter, at an estimated cost of Dollars 80m. Although the nightly volume on
the system is disappointingly low - around 2,000 contracts - more European
exchanges are expected to join the system. So far, only the Matif has signed
up, but negotiations with Liffe and the DTB, among others, continue. The
Matif's Globex agreement is not affected by the DTB link-up.
Officials at Liffe insist they do not see the DTB/Matif move as a threat.
'It will not take volume away from Liffe, since it means that the size of
the overall market will increase,' according to Mr Roger Barton, head of
business development.
However, the competition between Liffe and the DTB over the German
government bond contract, already fierce, is set to increase. Later this
month, Liffe launches a medium-term government bond future, which will
compete with an existing DTB contract. Holding on to its 70 per cent market
share in bund futures is very important to Liffe, since this is its largest
contract. Liffe estimates that 8 to 12 per cent of bund futures trading is
done by French institutions; this is potentially at risk if French house
switch their business to the Matif.
However, large, international fund managers still tend to channel their
business through London, and Liffe has undoubtedly benefited from its
position at the heart of Europe's financial markets.
But in each market there are still substantial funds held by
domestically-oriented institutions, which are more likely to be invested in
a contract traded locally.
'If the potential user base was fully tapped, they would be fighting for the
same people, but that is not the case,' according to Mr Harding.
As long as London maintains its position as Europe's financial centre,
Liffe's position at the heart of the futures market is not likely to be
seriously threatened.
It may lose out on a fruitful source of future growth, however, as other
exchanges expand their own domestic investor bases and pool these investors
through links with each other.
Of these, the link between the Matif and the DTB is so far the most
important. It is evidence of the determination with which French and German
institutions are advancing their position in Europe's emerging financial
structure.

FT  15 JAN 93 / TSB makes Pounds 597m bad debt charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group yesterday disclosed pre-tax profits of Pounds 43m for the year to
October 31, compared with a Pounds 47m loss in 1991, after making a Pounds
597m charge to cover possible bad debts.
The profit was less than brokers had expected. However, analysts' hopes were
raised for other banks' full-year results by TSB's record operating profit
of Pounds 648m, compared with Pounds 619m last year.
TSB also confirmed it had established a loan administration unit to handle
Pounds 1.8bn of doubtful loans made by Hill Samuel, TSB's merchant banking
subsidiary, mainly in the late 1980s. It has Pounds 883m of provisions in
its balance sheet to cover possible losses on these loans, and will try to
run them down within four years.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, hinted at the possibility that Hill
Samuel may be sold. He said the bank would not dispose of Hill Samuel unless
it received an offer 'we could not resist'. He said the bank had received
'approaches but not offers'. Hill Samuel made a Pounds 54m profit after bad
loans were put into the loan administration unit.
Sir Nicholas said banks would continue to suffer from high bad debt
provisions in the coming year, but there were 'grounds for cautious
optimism' about an upturn which would help TSB in 1993. Operating profit
improved after costs were reduced 2 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn, most of the
fall coming from a 6 per cent cut in staff costs. TSB has since been hit by
industrial action over redundancies.
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, said the results were 'disappointing'
and TSB wanted to achieve post-tax returns of 15 per cent on shareholders'
funds within three years. To do this, it would have to cut costs further.
The bank's interest spread - the gap between the average interest received
on assets, and that paid on liabilities - remained at 3.6 per cent. The
retail bank attracted Pounds 2.4bn of new retail funds by offering high
interest accounts.
The group maintained its dividend of 6.4p per share in spite of earnings of
0.6p per share. Its risk asset ratio - a measure of capital strength - fell
to 11.7 per cent (12.2 per cent). The Tier 1 ratio fell to 7.6 per cent (8.5
per cent). Shares rose from 146.5p to 153p on the results announcement, and
closed at 156p.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Siemens issues veiled profits warning after fall in new
orders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday issued a
veiled profits warning for the 1993 financial year as it revealed slowing
earnings growth and a fall in new orders in the first quarter.
While the full year's turnover is expected to rise 7 per cent to around
DM84bn (Pounds 33.3bn), 'it will take major efforts to maintain the level of
net income reached last year', said Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive.
The group, which includes the successful KWU power plant subsidiary, and the
stricken Siemens Nixdorf computer company, pushed up net earnings 9 per cent
to DM1.96bn last year on sales of DM78.5 bn.
Group orders in the first quarter of the current year fell 8 per cent, with
domestic and foreign demand dropping 4 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively. Sales rose only 4 per cent and net profits were up 2 per cent
at DM406m.
Mr von Pierer attributed the fall in incoming business to the 'postponement'
until later in the year of public telecommunications and power generation
orders worth DM1.6bn.
In spite of the slowdown - reflected in zero growth in world electrical
markets last year - 'prophecies of doom are unwarranted', he added.
However, Mr von Pierer expected flatter growth in new orders this year and
further staff cuts. Some 3,000 of the 413,000 employed worldwide at the end
of the last financial year had already gone and the total would be reduced
to less than 400,000 by the end of September.
At Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), where most of the 6,000 job cuts planned to be
made by the end of 1994 will now come in the current year, the group expects
'weak growth and further price erosion', according to Mr Hermann Franz, the
board member responsible for computers. Restructuring would continue and
high extraordinary expenditure would be necessary.
He reiterated that computers and semiconductors, which together lost more
than DM1bn last year, remained core businesses within Siemens.
Osram, Siemens' lamp producing unit, has signed an agreement to buy Sylvania
of the US for an undisclosed sum. The merger has been approved by US
anti-trust authorities and 'can go into effect in the near future', Mr von
Pierer said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Lonrho rights issue expected to fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S rights issue, which closes today, is expected to fail after many of
its institutional shareholders yesterday said they would not be taking up
their rights.
The share issue was designed to flop to enable Mr Dieter Bock, a German
financier who is underwriting half the new shares, to become the group's
biggest shareholder.
Lonrho's shares yesterday fell 1p to 71p compared with the rights issue
price of 85p.
Some of the group's big shareholders believe Mr Bock will shortly join the
board as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland.
One institutional shareholder said: 'We have been told by Lonrho that Mr
Rowland may retire quite soon in favour of Mr Bock.'
Several others said they had received a clear message from Lonrho that Mr
Bock had been chosen as Mr Rowland's successor and that the succession would
occur relatively quickly.
Shareholders have been deeply concerned in the past about the unresolved
question of who would succeed 75-year-old Mr Rowland.
Charterhouse, Lonrho's financial adviser, said: 'Mr Rowland is unlikely to
have sold his shares to someone he disagrees with or whom he is unhappy with
as a large and influential shareholder.'
Mr Bock has said he will consider whether to join the board several weeks
after the rights issue closes.
If Lonrho's shareholders do not take up their rights, Mr Bock will end up
with 18.8 per cent of the enlarged group.
Mr Bock has already bought almost half of Mr Rowland's stake at 115p a share
 -a substantial premium to Lonrho's current share price - and has the option
to buy the other half after three years. This would take Mr Bock's total
stake to 24.8 per cent.
To raise the money to buy his Lonrho stake, Mr Bock has made a number of
property disposals. He is also considering offers for 10 to 20 per cent of
his shareholding in Advanta, a Dutch-based company with extensive property
and construction interests in Germany.
Mr Bock is underwriting the deal through his privately owned company,
Laerstate, registered in the Netherlands.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Miller buys 20% Molson stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILLER Brewing, the beer arm of US food and tobacco group Philip Morris, is
broadening its international horizons by buying a 20 per cent stake in
Molson Breweries, Canada's biggest brewer. Molson is a joint venture between
Molson Companies of Toronto and Australia's Foster's Brewing.
Miller's USDollars 273m (Pounds 177.3m) investment is part of a wider
alliance with Molson and Foster's, which will also give the Milwaukee-based
company marketing and distribution rights in the US to a range of imported
beers produced by the Canadian and Australian groups. The deal will also
help Molson realise a long-held ambition to join a wider international
brewing alliance.
Molson Companies and Foster's will each retain a 40 per cent stake in Molson
Breweries, which controls about half the Canadian beer market. Revenues
totalled CDollars 632m (Pounds 321m) in the six months to September 30. The
company already brews Miller brands under licence in Canada. Miller will pay
a royalty on Molson and Foster's sales in the US.
Molson is the second-largest imported beer in the US after Heineken. Its
products, led by Molson Golden and Molson Light, have a share of about 16
per cent of the imported market.
Miller said yesterday that Molson and Foster's brands will be a 'strong
complement' to its existing products. But Mr Allan Kaplan, brewing analyst
at Merrill Lynch in New York, said the deal was a small one for a company of
Philip Morris's size and financial resources, and that it would only
modestly augment Miller's volumes in the US.
The deal with Molson follows Philip Morris's purchase last month of a 7.9
per cent interest in Fomento Economico Mexicano, Mexico's biggest beverage
company. Philip Morris, through Miller Brewing which it acquired in 1970, is
number two in the US beer market, with an estimated 23 per cent share behind
St Louis-based Anheuser-Busch's 45.5 per cent. However, competition has been
intensifying in a contracting market.
Miller Brewing posted a 41.5 per cent drop in third-quarter operating
profits to Dollars 55m, because of lower volumes and a provision for an
early retirement programme, while operating revenues fell almost 8 per cent
to Dollars 1bn.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Hospitals face worst cash crisis in 30 years, say doctors'
leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSPITALS face their worst funding crisis in 30 years, doctors' leaders
claimed yesterday, amid a bitter exchange of arguments with Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary.
A British Medical Association council meeting adopted a resolution declaring
that current funding was 'inadequate to deliver fully comprehensive patient
care'. BMA leaders say hospitals will have to close wards and cancel
operations for the rest of the financial year because they have already
spent their budgets.
The BMA warned Mrs Bottomley at a meeting late last month of its concerns
over funding but Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the council, said he was
disappointed by her response. 'Our impression was that she is going to try
to ride out the storm until some new money becomes available in April,' he
said.
Mrs Bottomley reacted immediately to the BMA criticism, accusing the
association of a 'glib response' that disguised the need for doctors to
examine ways of using resources more efficiently. 'The BMA has never taken
any other line than that the NHS is underfunded,' she said.
Under the new system of NHS funding, hospitals are contracted by health
authorities to carry out specified amounts of work during a year. Some
hospitals are in difficulty now because they have already exhausted their
budgets.
Both Mr John Chawner and Dr Ian Bogle, chairmen respectively of the BMA's
consultants' and general practitioners' committees, said the financial
problems were the most serious they had experienced in 30 years - worse than
the 1987-88 financial crisis that prompted the NHS reforms.
The BMA says many hospitals will be forced either to stop non-emergency work
or to 'solicit business' from GP fundholders, who have alternative sources
of funds. It claims that this is leading to the development of two-tier
standards of service.
Mrs Bottomley says that record amounts are being spent on the health
service, and that hospital managers know contract-funding has to span a full
year's activity and should allocate resources accordingly. The BMA is
conducting a survey of hospitals, and may then consider making an approach
to Mr John Major, the prime minister.
In another move yesterday, the BMA warned that without sufficient funding
and careful management, the government's Tomlinson report recommendations to
rationalise hospital provision in London could lead to a 'disastrous
destabilisation of integrated patient care'. A similar warning was sounded
by a newly formed London Health Services Crisis Committee.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Revenue seeks to protect tax staff whose jobs may be
contracted out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue has become the first government department to state that
it is seeking to protect the pay and conditions of staff whose jobs might be
contracted out to the private sector.
Mr Steve Matheson, the Revenue's director of operations, has written to
staff, anxious about the effect on their jobs, to tell them that four
prototype 'market testing' schemes involving secretarial staff have been
stopped.
Under market testing, the first step in the process that leads to
contracting out, services provided in-house are tested against the market.
Staff are encouraged to bid for the contract on the same basis as the
private sector.
The Revenue's decision to reorganise market-testing ensures that staff are
covered by Tupe - Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) -
regulations. These were designed to protect wages and conditions in company
mergers.
The move follows pressure by the union for tax staff, the Inland Revenue
Staff Federation, which last week announced a large majority for industrial
action against market testing. Mr Clive Brooke, the general secretary of the
IRSF, said the Revenue's decision was a 'victory in a battle but not in the
war'.
Mr Matheson said in a circular to staff: 'We have decided not to go ahead
with the market testing of these four areas. We have to organise the work in
such a way as to be as sure as we can that the Tupe regulations will apply.'
In some circumstances the Tupe regulations can apply to contracting-out and
prevent private companies from cutting the pay or worsening the conditions
of civil servants they take on. That could restrict some parts of the big
market-testing programme announced by the government in November.
Market-testing is this year being extended to 44,000 civil servants and the
value of the work being tested has risen from Pounds 25m in 1992 to Pounds
1.5bn in 1993. Next Monday the government is hosting a conference for
private companies on how to compete for that work.
Until now the government has accepted that the Tupe regulations, inspired by
the European Community, do apply in areas where there is clearly a separate
undertaking being contracted-out, but says they do not apply in more loosely
organised functions such as secretarial work.
Each government department can organise market-testing in the way it sees
fit and the Inland Revenue's positive attitude to Tupe may not be repeated
throughout the civil service.
Market testing of secretarial work in the Inland Revenue will still go ahead
but instead of being organised in four small schemes, which might not have
qualified for Tupe protection, it will be organised throughout the Inland
Revenue South West.
Mr Matheson argues that, when restructured, secretarial services are more
likely to be covered by Tupe. But he also warns that job losses will still
be unavoidable.

FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another profits warning from Rhone-Poulenc does not inspire confidence that
management has its finger on the pulse. Until the autumn, the company was
predicting profits growth of more than 15 per cent for 1992. Now the
increase may be little more than 5 per cent. The downturn in chemicals in
the final months of the year must have caught the company on the hop; the
fact that the news broke in an unplanned press report also seems careless.
The broader question is whether the announcement clears the way for the
French government's privatisation share offering or is the final nail in its
coffin. Since the offer document contains nothing concrete by way of a
profits forecast, there is no binding reason not to proceed before the
February 1 deadline. But the non-voting shares yesterday slid back towards
FFr500 - a level at which the government has so far been unwilling to sell.
Even if the government changed its mind on that, the market will now take
some convincing that all the bad news is out. The company argues that
deferred sales of agrochemicals will boost profits this year. The
combination of a US economic upturn and a stronger dollar should help it
ride out the downturn in Europe from here on. After yesterday, though,
investors may have their doubts.

FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is not much point any more in carping about whether the Rank
Organisation was wise to buy Mecca in 1990. The purchase left the company
saddled with a large debt burden at just the wrong time in the cycle. Even
critics of the original purchase must admit that the company has managed to
live with high gearing reasonably well. Capital spending has been maintained
at a level high enough to keep ahead of its competitors. Thanks admittedly
to Pounds 151m worth of disposals, it recorded a positive cash flow of
Pounds 59m last year before currency translation changes.
Now that conditions in the US are starting to improve, Rank thus seems on
the road to recovery. The danger for the equity market is in over-estimating
the speed at which it will travel. The Pounds 15m loss in video distribution
will surely narrow further in 1993 and it is scarcely conceivable that
Butlins will have as bad a year as 1992, but Rank itself is rightly cautious
about the return of UK consumer confidence and the outlook for Rank Xerox is
poor.
Rank seems set for a year of only modest profit growth. Further hotel
disposals may make a small dent in its debt and the signs are Rank may
realise quite attractive prices. But, barring a sale of its film and
television interests, gearing will still be undesirably high a year from
now. That means dividend growth may be slow to resume. Rank may yet be
tempted to launch a rights issue once serious recovery gets under way. Small
wonder the vultures are hovering over the film interests even though Rank
categorically maintains they are not for sale. It might make more strategic
sense for Rank to exit from its joint venture with Xerox. But if a serious
offer did emerge for the film interests, shareholders would be right to
demand it not be rejected out of hand.

FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Boxed in at TSB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB's new strategy might be more convincing if it did not read as though it
had come straight out of a business school text book. It might also be more
persuasive had it not come from the bank that clinched the Pounds 777m Hill
Samuel acquisition and developed the disastrous Mortgage Express - a venture
which is now selling repossessed houses at an average loss of Pounds 35,000
each. Total quality management is clearly arriving at the TSB none too soon.
There are certainly worries. Focusing on personal business in the retail
bank may be the only real option open to TSB, but it offers a far from
certain future. Personal lending and other financial services are becoming
increasingly competitive - as the establishment of NatWest Life
demonstrates. With too many banks and building societies chasing too little
business, returns are likely to fall. TSB risks being squeezed between the
building societies' lower cost base and the big clearers' range of services.
And, ironically, trussing up Hill Samuel to make it attractive to a buyer
may deny TSB the painfully-earned rewards of any recovery in the commercial
sector.
In the shorter term there is at least a 25 per cent yield premium to the
market for the shares to hang on to. If the bad loans have finally been
cleaned out, then provisions may fall this year and investors may warm to
the recovery story, but the bank has disappointed on bad loans before. Last
year's revenues owe something to one-off factors such as gilt sales, while
the scope for further cost reductions must be limited. Unless the banking
sector can find new income streams, TSB looks like a bank with nowhere to
go.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Deadlocked in a costly embrace: In the wake of this week's
bombing raids on Iraq, Roger Matthews explains why the west's continued
confrontation with Saddam Hussein is fraught with risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few recent international tragedies have become so rigidly and hopelessly
institutionalised as the one being inflicted on the people of Iraq.
Wednesday's raid by allied aircraft on the south of the country serves
principally to confirm the extent to which President Saddam Hussein on one
hand, and the US, Britain and France on the other, are locked into positions
from which there is no retreat and equally little sign of advance.
The political career of Saddam Hussein since he fully assumed the leadership
of Iraq in 1979 has been characterised by military conflict and relentlessly
narrowing options. For all but four years since then Iraq has lived on a
virtual war footing. The survival of the regime became, during the
eight-year war with Iran and in the wake of of the crushing defeat in
Kuwait, the only rationale of government.
Saddam's behaviour might appear less irrational to western governments if it
was better understood that domestic repression and external threats are the
sole remaining pillars of his authority. He came to power imbued with dreams
of Arab leadership as Egypt was abdicating that role by making peace with
Israel. He tried to live out the dream by attacking Iran and later Kuwait.
Both adventures were disasters for Iraq, but the flag he raised of Arab
defiance to Persian and western ambitions, flutters still, albeit raggedly.
Having marched down this road so consistently and for so long Saddam has no
alternative but to continue. The effectiveness of sanctions offers him no
possibility of improving living conditions for the bulk of the population.
The generous compensation given to the families of soldiers killed in war
has long since ceased. Inflation is rampant, medical and food shortages are
worsening.
It is possible that the tolerance of the Iraqi people will finally snap or
an assassin will put an end to Saddam. But in the absence of such
unpredictable acts the western allies are faced with an open-ended policy of
containment and with it longer-term risks for the overall stability of the
region.
The Iraqi regime is bound to remain defiant because domestically it cannot
risk appearing anything less. It may for a while appear to accept the
implementation of United Nations resolutions, such as the return of weapons
inspectors to Baghdad and the removal of missiles systems from the exclusion
zone north of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd. But the very nature
of the allied response on Wednesday to his repeated provocations will almost
certainly tempt Saddam to probe again within weeks or months.
The fact that Saddam virtually invited the allies to attack showed that he
thought himself to be in a no-lose situation. The limited allied raid
inflicted little damage on the regime, enabled Saddam to appear on
television heroically claiming victory against overwhelming odds, and
rattled the dovecots of those Arab regimes which might be vulnerable
domestically to a close association with the US.
It will have been with some satisfaction that Baghdad heard Mr Sharif Zeid
Bin Shaker, the prime minister of Jordan, say his government had received
with 'deep regret and reprehension' the news of the air strikes. Arabs and
Moslems felt a growing anger, he said, over the double standards in
enforcing Security Council resolutions. While the allies attacked Iraq they
were not willing to do anything about the defiance to the UN shown by Israel
and Serbia.
Egypt, Turkey and Syria, all vital components of the allied Gulf war
alliance, expressed similar sentiments. And, with the exception of Kuwait,
there is anxiety among the monarchies of the Gulf about the consequences of
further attacks on Iraq.
It seems probable that the limited nature of Wednesday's air attacks were in
part designed to accommodate those fears. Some Pentagon officials had
indicated privately that the raids were going to be massive and widespread,
an option that existed and one, which if carried out, would certainly have
had a more damaging political impact on the Baghdad regime.
When further provocations come from Iraq in defiance of Security Council
resolutions there will be a temptation for the allies to increase the dosage
of the medicine that they have prescribed and with equally little assurance
of short-term beneficial effects. But there is the risk of two, worsening,
long-term side effects.
The first is the eventual disintegration of the country as a single,
governable political entity. The two no-fly zones have already given the
Kurds a degree of autonomy in the north, and the Shia the beginnings of a
regional identity in the south. Even if Saddam goes, the structures of the
ruling Ba'ath party would be hard to dismantle and its officials would be
still wedded to the concept of a single Iraq governed by the Sunni minority
in the geographical centre of the country. The greater the suffering imposed
on the people of Iraq, the greater the probable retribution which will
eventually flow, and the higher the risk of Iraq one day descending into the
sort of political chaos witnessed in Lebanon.
Second, and even more difficult to assess, is the impact that the west's
renewed military operations against Iraq will have on the peoples and
governments of the Middle East. There has been no more durable tightrope
walker for the past three decades than King Hussein of Jordan, and the
reaction of the government in Amman shows which way he is leaning.
Elsewhere, the collapse of pan-Arabism, the now unchallenged military
supremacy of Israel, the continued denial of Palestinian self-rule and the
general sense of political drift have created a vacuum that Islamic
fundamentalists, inspired by Iran, are striving to fill.
The perception that the US, Britain and France will do nothing to aid the
Moslems of Bosnia or the Palestinians forced out of the occupied
territories, while they determinedly bomb Iraq, is potent propaganda. 'Why
just Iraq?' was the question being asked in several Arab capitals yesterday.
Whatever the western answer it will not diminish the unease of those
governments, such as Saudi Arabia, which are unable to distance themselves
from the allied action.
From the day last August when the government in Riyadh reluctantly permitted
the return of allied aircraft to police the southern no-fly zone, it had to
accept a close association with policies and actions that might be deeply
unpopular among Moslems throughout the world.
At the same time it was aware that the weaker that Iraq became the greater
was the potential influence of Iran, which has made little attempt to
disguise its contempt for the Saudi monarchy since the 1979 revolution.
In the long historical rivalry between Iran and Iraq, one's misfortune has
always been the other's success. There are signs of growing concern in
Washington about Iranian ambitions, nuclear and political. However much
these may be denied by the more pragmatic elements of the leadership in
Tehran, it is probable that the presence and actions of American forces in
the Gulf will most aid those who wish to give greater substance to
Washington's suspicions.
Awareness of all these risks is not, however, likely to have more than a
tactical impact on the allies' pursuit of Saddam Hussein and their
determination that he should abide strictly by the terms of UN resolutions.
The commitment to the no-fly zones is open-ended while the dispatch of
American troops to Kuwait ties Washington more closely to the survival of a
government which enjoys little international respect and is subject to
persistent domestic criticism.
In such a situation, where the only western response to further Iraqi
provocation is military, it is almost inevitable that the allies lose
control, if not sight, of the political repercussions. That is the cost
which will have to be borne from a confrontation in which Saddam Hussein,
perhaps desperate and his options bared to the bone, continues to dictate
the direction and pace of events.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The black hole of Calcutt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT APPEARS that the most draconian proposal in Sir David Calcutt's review of
press self-regulation, a statutory press tribunal, has already been
dismissed by the government. This, at least, may be unreservedly welcomed.
The idea that the correct response to the shortcomings of Britain's press is
to establish a government-appointed inquisitor, with the power to fine
newspapers and prevent publication of articles which violate its standards,
is one of the most ill-judged to have reached the public policy agenda for
many years. It would have led to a form of official censorship unknown in
peacetime Britain since the 17th century.
So what of the rest of Calcutt Two? It has three main components: a review
of the Press Complaints Commission, a self-regulatory body set up after the
first Calcutt committee report in 1990; and a reconsideration of two
specific matters raised in Calcutt One, namely the laws on privacy and
telephone interceptions.
The bulk of the report concerns the PCC, about which Sir David has two
grievances: that it was not established entirely along the lines recommended
in his first report and that it has failed to command public confidence. On
the first point, Sir David is right, but he then hurries without presenting
serious evidence to the second and his draconian conclusion. This
precipitate reasoning undermines one his best points: that the commission
would have a better chance of establishing its credentials if it had more
non-press members. It follows that a more balanced commission would also
have more authority to consider revisions to the press code of conduct, a
number of which Sir David canvasses. These are points the commission should
entertain when it responds to the report.
When it comes to privacy, Sir David argues that 'it cannot be said that
there has been a serious breakdown of the system which has been put in
place'. He then proposes a criminal law on the subject, adding that a remedy
in civil law might be an acceptable second best.
This is a complex matter of deep concern, since the freedom of ordinary
people to live quietly is to be valued not much less than the freedom to
publish. But Sir David's proposal to create a criminal offence of entering
private property without consent with a view to obtaining information for
publication is fraught with difficulty. How, in practice, would courts
interpret the proposed journalist's defence of pursuing 'seriously
anti-social conduct' or 'matters directly affecting the discharge of any
public function of the individual concerned?' Where does the behaviour of Mr
David Mellor fit into these definitions, or indeed that of some members of
the royal family? Similar difficulties attend the idea of a tort of privacy,
along with a further one: only the rich would be able to use it, given the
state of the legal aid system.
The most fundamental objection to Sir David's approach, however, is that he
in effect proposes laws only to stop journalists snooping. What about the
credit rating agencies, debt collectors, local government people and
immigration officers? The only sound basis for press law is to require that
journalists obey the law of the land - without privilege and without
discrimination.
Recent events suggest that the laws on trespass and telephone bugging
contain serious gaps. The government would do well to focus on plugging
them.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Uncertain success: Military objectives were achieved, but
there is doubt over political goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little went wrong. But the success of the swift return visit to Iraqi
battlefields by the US and its British and French allies will be measured
not by how well it was done but by what it achieved.
Militarily it was impressively executed. Co-ordinating a bombing attack
involving 110 aircraft and bringing them all back is no mean feat. In those
terms, the US-led strike compared favourably with the operation most closely
comparable - the punitive US bombing raid against Libya in April 1986. Then,
despite the involvement of large numbers of ships and aircraft, military
plans were only partly fulfilled and one aircraft was lost over target.
This time, the allies had plenty of time to plan and study a whole range of
'target sets', and enjoyed the benefit of their weeks of rehearsal two years
ago in the air campaign against Iraq. The sites were well known, and in most
cases had been attacked before.
But whereas the semi-botched bombing of Libya did apparently succeed - in
retrospect - in placing a restraint on Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the outcome
of the 'spanking' of President Saddam Hussein is far from certain.
The damage caused in the precision-bombing attacks was yesterday still being
evaluated. The Pentagon said Iraq's southern air defences had been
'seriously degraded'. But it is questionable how much President Saddam
perceives this as a setback, since it was an attack that he deliberately
provoked, and the outcome of which was never in doubt.
Iraqi forces put up little opposition - possibly because, as in 1991, they
knew they were unable to. Mr Saddam's ostensible purpose was to show that
international action against Iraq was a US campaign founded on dubious
legality, and to use that to obtain support from Islamic countries for
easing sanctions.
Expressions of concern yesterday by Syria and Pakistan indicated this
argument may have struck some chords. The UN Security Council's Resolution
688 of April 1991 did not go beyond telling Iraq to stop repressing its
minorities and to allow access to humanitarian organisations. The
justification of the US and its allies is that they need to monitor what is
happening in these regions, can only do so by air, and need to ensure that
they can do so safely.
The air strikes were limited to air-defence systems - missile sites and
radar and command facilities - inside the no-fly zone which the US, Britain
and France imposed in August south of the 32nd parallel. Air bases to the
north of the line were not attacked, as many analysts had expected, even
though they have been used for recent incursions by Iraqi fighters,
including the MiG-25 shot down by a US F-16 on December 27.
However, any further allied military action could well include targets
further into Iraq.
The bombing raids were the first concerted attack against Iraq since
hostilities closed in February 1991, although the allies have repeatedly
wielded the threat of military action: to force the withdrawal of Iraqi
forces so that Kurds could move back into a haven, to obtain access for UN
weapons inspectors, and to ensure the destruction of missile-making
equipment.
Allied officials stressed that the attacks were on military installations
directly threatening their own aircraft. But the political objective behind
the attack remains vague.
In the Gulf war, the declared aim was to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This
was extended to include the crippling of Iraq's offensive military
capability, with a further aim - implicitly understood - of creating
conditions in which President Saddam might fall. Only after the war did the
allies face public criticism in the west for not going further and - as
General Norman Schwarzkopf said his forces could have done when they thrust
northwards into Iraq - turning left towards Baghdad instead of right.
The message the allies now appear to be giving is that they will keep up
sanctions and be ready to attack periodically until Iraq moderates its
behaviour. But the political goal which military escalation - if it comes to
that - would serve is still not explicit.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Keep competing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL of Mr Karel van Miert as EC competition commissioner seems
already to have raised hopes and fears in roughly equal measure. To those
who regarded Sir Leon Brittan as an unreconstructed Thatcherite, Mr Van
Miert's credentials may seem agreeably middle-of-the-road. For those who
adhere to the idea that interventionism is the primrose path to economic
inefficiency, their champion seems to be defecting to the enemy.
Mr Van Miert's actual views, as reported on the opposite page, scarcely bear
out either view. Indeed, he has limited scope for change, since most of his
new job consists of applying existing rules. But in merger policy
especially, hard cases will inevitably come his way; and it is here that
there is room for unease.
In anti-trust issues, Mr Van Miert says, competition should not be the only
criterion: industrial, social and other factors also apply. Indeed they do,
but they are not the business of the competition commissioner. There are
powerful lobbies against competition, at the corporate and national level.
The beneficiaries of competition are the general public, who do not have a
corresponding voice. Although industrial and competition policy ought to be
two sides of the same coin, in practice they are often at variance. If the
result is to be a productive compromise, it is above all necessary that the
competition commissioner should fight his corner.
This is not to say that the job is a purely negative or static one. In
particular, the single market will bring pressure for merger in some
industries, as a direct result of the increase in competition and the
enlargement of the market itself. If the result is improved economic
efficiency, there would need to be powerful arguments for blocking it on
competition grounds.
One of the important aims of the single market, after all, is to produce
companies which are capable of competing on a world stage. That is an
industrial policy objective. But competition policy need not be at odds,
provided trade policy allows relatively free competitive entry for imports
into the EC; and that is now a matter for Sir Leon.
There is also room for initiative on the vexed question of national monopoly
in utilities such as telecommunications. This is a politically sensitive
area. But introducing genuine pan-European competition into these markets is
not only desirable in itself. It is also an essential step in establishing a
single market in utilities, which is much to be desired in terms of economic
efficiency.
There is another reform to which Mr Van Miert could usefully address
himself. An obvious flaw of the EC system of regulation is its lack of
transparency at any level. Neither the competition directorate nor the
Commission are obliged to explain and defend their decisions, as the
competition authorities do in the UK. The idea is occasionally mooted of a
separate EC cartel office on the German model. That may be a step too far.
But anything Mr Van Miert can do to explain what he is up to would save
industry a good deal of second-guessing. Indeed, transparency and
accountability are the best guarantee of a fair competition policy, and
therefore the strongest underpinning of Mr Van Miert's moral authority.

RARELY THESE days does a clearing bank get the better of the government.
However, the Department of Trade and Industry has spent Pounds 2.4m on an
image-improvement exercise for NatWest.
The DTI yesterday published the report of its second investigation into the
bank's role in the Blue Arrow affair. The investigation was prompted in
April by a request from NatWest's chairman, Lord Alexander.
He had been concerned that the bank's image was being tarnished by
allegations that it had concealed documents from the original DTI probe in
1989. These allegations were made during the Blue Arrow trials in 1991 and
were widely reported in the press. Mr Tom Frost, then NatWest's chief
executive, was the target of particular criticism.
However, Lord Alexander was convinced of the bank's innocence. He was
totally vindicated yesterday.
The DTI inspectors are so dismissive of the allegations that there must be a
question of why a full-scale inquiry was needed. The DTI's internal
inspectors could surely have satisfied themselves that no second inquiry was
needed - and the DTI could have made a statement to that effect.
Instead two highly paid lawyers and an accountant were employed by the DTI
to carry out a full investigation. The worst judgments that they can make of
NatWest was that it was inexperienced in investment banking and inefficient
 -which is a case of stating the obvious.
On the other hand, the DTI has succeeded in further denting the Bank of
England's reputation as a supervisor, which was bruised enough last year by
widespread criticism of its supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, the corrupt international bank.
Though yesterday's report makes no direct criticism of the Bank, it
demonstrates a lack of aggression in the Bank's work in maintaining the
probity and soundness of UK banks. The introduction into the Bank of a new
investigations department and a new legal unit, both run by outsiders, has
come not a moment too soon.

Fur is flying with a vengeance in Chile thanks to central bank boss Roberto
Zahler, who has rubbed up business chiefs the wrong way with a sobering
speech.
The best economic performance for three decades - GDP up by almost a tenth,
private investment by nearly a third, and exports booming - has seen Chile
likened to the tigers of south-east Asia. But with business chiefs preening
themselves accordingly, Zahler has come up with what he claims is a more
accurate image.
'Tigers are not born overnight, particularly if they have a long history of
being cats, with the culture, habits and outlook of cats,' he declared.
What's more, they weren't even well-balanced cats, but manic-depressives
responding to one good year with euphoria only to wilt in despair at a
single poor economic indicator.
The country's media have reacted angrily to his call for greater realism.
Zoological treatises have been consulted on what sort of feline Chile
resembles: cat, tiger or jaguar. Psychiatrists have expounded on the
symptoms of manic-depression, which perhaps explains one top businessman's
remark that the only cats with inferiority complexes are to be found in the
central bank.

The annual meeting season has not really got under way yet, but company
chairmen fearing a nasty grilling by shareholders should take a leaf out of
the Royal Bank of Scotland's book.
After a year in which the Royal Bank's profits sank to Pounds 21m, its staff
were demoralised by the promise of big job cuts, and shareholders irritated
by the handsome salaries paid to a few executive stars such as insurance
supremo Peter Wood, so yesterday's agm in Edinburgh was expected to be a
rowdy affair.
Fortunately, the Royal Bank's spin-doctors have discovered paragraph 6.8 of
the Cadbury report. This is the bit about shareholders submitting difficult
questions in writing in advance. So the chairman, former defence secretary
Lord Younger, announced that there had been 200 questions - most on three
subjects: the composition of the board, directors' pay and Peter Wood. He
then read out the answers and Peter Wood was never mentioned again.
Younger's patience and sense of timing in dealing with the rest of the
questions from the floor was exquisite. But then that is one of the few
reasons for hiring an ex-politician as chairman.

'Hush . . . keep it dark]' The once famous watchword of Britain's wartime
radio character, Commander High-Price, lives on at the Ministry of Defence.
Instead of holding its own briefing on the air attacks against Iraq, it told
reporters to muster at RAF Strike Command in High Wycombe, originally named
RAF Southdown with the object of confusing the Germans. The ministry's
directions were in keeping with tradition. 'Follow the signs from the town
centre,' they said. There are, of course, no signs.
Hence hacks spent much of the night wandering the dark backroads of
Buckinghamshire. One French reporter still didn't know where he was when
he'd arrived. Fortunately, the RAF commanders were fully abreast of the
latest bulletins on the operation from America. They had been watching them
on CNN.

With 37-year-old Larry Summers almost certain to be confirmed as David
Mulford's successor as the US Treasury's international point man, the World
Bank is likely to be hunting for a chief economist.
Since the job involves serving both as a personal economic adviser to Lewis
Preston, the bank's president, and running a big research department, it
calls for an unusual economist - somebody with administrative skills as well
as a 'world class' academic reputation.
Traditionally, the job has been done by an American, but if Preston wants a
respected development economist with strong free-market credentials, he
could do worse than pick Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University. Being an
Indian, he might be a more effective third world ambassador.
If the bank decides (as it did with Larry Summers) that an academic
reputation is more important than development experience per se, then the
field would widen considerably. The bank could consider such respected
non-American macro-economists as Willem Buiter of Yale or Olivier Blanchard
of MIT.
However, the likelihood is that the job will go to another American. Jeffrey
Sachs of Harvard, who has made a reputation as a roving adviser to the third
world and former communist countries, is one name mentioned. But having
recently publicly attacked the IMF for inaction in Russia, he might be seen
as insufficiently discreet.
But perhaps a more imaginative choice might be Harvard's Martin Feldstein -
the director of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a former CEA
chairman under Reagan.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Ignorance that makes 'Christian west' fear militant
Islam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ALUM BATI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Isn't it depressing? Day after day we read about 'militant Islam'
('Cold war warmed over: Militant Islam has become the west's new evil
empire', January 13), but what is depressing is not so much the perceived
spread of Islamic militancy but the west's inability to understand the
causes or to make any rational judgment about the future.
Edward Mortimer is, unfortunately, quite right in believing Islam has become
the bogey of the west. One should clarify this and say 'the Christian west'
because there is no doubt a strong hint of religious prejudice in its
reaction. Added to that is the age-old fear of the great-unwashed taking
their destinies into their own hands. For sure, this all leads, temporarily,
to chaos and turmoil in the countries concerned but why should anyone else
care? Is it a burning morality, with the west wanting to uphold the rights
of individuals? Algeria's experience would suggest not. So what is it that
causes the west to fear the so-called Islamic revival? I would venture to
say little more than ignorance and prejudice.
The Islamic movements are merely expressions of the common people against
corruption, exploitation and oppression. In Latin America, the same people
have turned to the Catholic church. In eastern Europe, they once turned to
communism. These are simply conduits - the vast majority have little real
understanding of any of these ideologies but they find them a good frame of
reference. They are comfortable with them. Islam is not really what is
important to the Islamic movements. When the other aims are achieved, the
momentum behind the movements will dissipate. The west, by opposing these
movements, simply strengthens them. Instead, it should learn to keep its
nose out of other peoples' troubles.

FT  15 JAN 93 / No soft touch for business: Karel van Miert, new EC
competition commissioner, talks to Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this week, a British newspaper described Mr Karel van Miert, the
European Community's new competition commissioner, as 'an old-style
socialist'.
It was a description which made the Belgian commissioner laugh: he says he
intends to exercise EC competition rules 'without ideological
preconceptions'. Mr Van Miert's style, it seems, will be different from that
of his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, a British free-trader and former
minister under the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Sir Leon was often criticised for pursuing an unbending hard line against
cartels, state subsidies, anti-competitive mergers and national monopolies.
Together, he and Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish commissioner who preceded
him, built a strict competition policy into the backbone of the European
single market.
When Mr Van Miert was appointed before Christmas, companies and governments
that had fallen foul of Sir Leon breathed a sigh of relief, believing
competition policy would be relaxed. Under Mr Van Miert, the thinking went,
private-sector groups bent on expansion through takeovers would be subject
to less rigorous scrutiny from Brussels; plans to liberalise national
energy, telecoms and postal monopolies would be shelved; and governments
would be given more leeway to subsidise loss-making state industries.
This view is too simplistic. First, Mr Van Miert has already demonstrated
that he is no soft touch for big business. In his previous role as transport
commissioner, he pushed through measures to liberalise the sheltered EC air
transport market, despite the initial reservations of France and southern EC
member states and some of the Community's largest airlines. Opponents won
some concessions, notably on the timing of full liberalisation, but Mr Van
Miert's low-profile negotiating style achieved the desired result: open
competition on all EC routes by mid-1997.
This week, in his first interview since taking office, Mr Van Miert told the
Financial Times he would adopt a similar approach to competition policy:
determined, even-handed and pragmatic. The existing competition rules, he
stressed, have not changed, but 'from a philosophical point of view, there
might be a different attitude on . . . how to cope with the rules'.
In particular, Mr Van Miert explained, a strict competition policy would not
be the sole guiding principle in anti-trust and state aid decisions. He said
industrial, regional, social and environment policy should also be taken
into consideration.
'I think the economy should be efficiently run, which means a fully fledged
competition policy should be one of the main instruments,' he said. 'But
competition is not the ultimate goal of the economy. The ultimate goal is
for the economy to perform for the people, so that everyone gets his fair
share and companies have a good environment to prosper, to invest and to be
competitive.'
How would this attitude work in practice? Mr Van Miert would not talk about
specific cases, but referred to the three main areas of his work: Mergers.
Mr Van Miert has to work within the strict framework of the 1990 EC merger
rules. Under them, simple decisions are taken by the Commission's merger
task force and only initialled by the commissioner. Sometimes, however, the
attitude of the competition commissioner is crucial. The controversial
Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer,
was only blocked by the Commission in 1991 because of Sir Leon's fierce
opposition. Competition lawyers in Brussels believe Mr Van Miert might not
have taken such a strong line.
Mr Van Miert himself suggested that in cases where the Commission is likely
to oppose a merger, the companies themselves should be allowed to decide how
the deal could be amended to meet Commission objections. That could mean an
end to the detailed negotiations between Commission and companies, which
were a feature of Sir Leon's application of merger policy. 'I feel we should
avoid as much as possible, intervening directly in the responsibility of how
companies are run,' said Mr Van Miert. In practice, however, he may have to
make deals - or face the unpalatable option of blocking a merger outright.
Monopolies. Sir Leon Brittan told Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, that he would make liberalisation of state monopolies his
principal aim, if he was given a second term. That may have been one reason
why Mr Delors believed it was prudent to move Sir Leon from competition to
the external trade portfolio - a move welcomed by Mr Delors' compatriots in
France.
But in spite of the optimism of French energy and telecommunications
utilities, Mr Van Miert said he had not shelved the Commission's special
powers to liberalise anti-competitive monopolies. Much will depend on
whether Mr Abel Matutes, the new energy commissioner, and Mr Martin
Bangemann, who has added telecommunications and postal services to his
industry portfolio, will want to enlist Mr Van Miert's support for an
aggressive campaign against such groups.
State subsidies. Competition lawyers and officials within the Commission
believe this is the area where Mr Van Miert will face the most challenges to
his authority. 'One of the most interesting things to watch will be whether
industries in crisis are going to be subject to special rules,' said Mr
Michael Reynolds, a partner in the Brussels office of Allen &amp; Overy, the
British law firm.
Sir Leon upset the French, Italian and Spanish governments by taking an
extremely tough line on illegal state aid. But as the recession deepens in
Europe, the pressure on governments to subsidise ailing industries is
increasing. As Mr Van Miert put it: 'These will be the most difficult
decisions because of the economic situation, the difficulties in many
sectors and because the margin for different assessments is bigger than in
other (areas of policy).'
As if to underline the point, one of the first ministers to seek advice on
Mr Van Miert's attitude to state intervention was Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of Britain's Board of Trade, who came to Brussels yesterday with
his suggestions for easing pit closures in the coal industry through
subsidies. Mr Van Miert suggested in the interview that he may try to
release the pressure on industries suffering from recession by giving
governments longer in which to reduce state subsidies.
What Mr Van Miert now needs is a series of cases on which to cut his
competition teeth. Followers of competition policy are concerned that he has
not altered the composition of his cabinet to include any competition
experts, but officials in the Commission's competition directorate are
cautiously optimistic. 'We have a very professional commissioner, who's
experienced and with whom we feel quite comfortable,' one official said.
Certainly his public profile is likely to be lower than that of his
predecessor. Sir Leon delivered more than 400 speeches in his four years as
competition commissioner. Mr Van Miert made about half that number as
transport commissioner.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: PM must make MI5 accountable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA ROCHE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported ('MPs press for scrutiny of security services', January
14) that the prime minister is undecided as to whether to include
parliamentary accountability of MI5 in his legislative plans.
As he claims to believe in open government, John Major should, for once,
overrule his home secretary and act decisively. Kenneth Clarke told the home
affairs select committee during our investigation: 'I will account (for MI5)
and I will not answer any of the tantalising questions.'
Such a cynical dismissal of an all-party committee attempting to do its job
is breathtaking. Taxpayers who fund MI5 have a right to know how their money
is spent. Allegations of MI5 involvement in the arms-for-Iraq, Matrix
Churchill and now the 'Camillagate' affairs do nothing to boost public
confidence in the security services. Clearly the committee would not wish to
risk endangering life by interfering in operational matters, but it is high
time the prime minister acted to ensure that the policies, administration
and spending of MI5 are fully accountable to parliament.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Regulators giving unsatisfactory support at
grassroots level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are two dimensions absent from your excellent leader, 'Reviewing
the Regulators' (January 13).
There is currently a debate instituted by the Post Office Users National
Council (POUNC) on the need for an advisory body to represent the public
interest and to carry out independent research and auditing, in addition to
a regulatory body for a privatised utility with monopoly power. For example,
in the case of the Post Office, the government is the regulator and POUNC
the advisory body.
As secretary of Bridport's local advisory committees for both the Post
Office and Telecommunications, I do not find my relationship with Oftel as
regulator altogether satisfactory.
It is my considered view that Oftel does not give grassroots advisory bodies
enough support and specific advice.
The other matter is concerned with the quality of information on which
regulators act. It is now commonplace to read of unsatisfactory audit
reports from accountants, despite estimates suggesting that Britain employs
per capita almost 10 times as many accountants as the Japanese economy.
How can the regulators do their job if the information on which they act is
flawed or unreliable? This is another argument for an independent advisory
body capable of building up authoritative research to support a function of
impartial advice to users and the government.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: No wastage in commercially minded construction
quango
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir CLIFFORD CHETWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Resurgence of quangos defies
Thatcherite initiative' (January 14).
The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) does not receive direct
funds from the government but collects a statutory levy from the
construction industry and contracts with Training and Enterprise Councils
and Local Enterprise Companies for further funding of training schemes.
The CITB is controlled and run for the benefit of the industry by senior
executives of the construction industry, two trade unionists and two
representatives of further and higher education.
The inference in the term quango is of a flaccid organisation with no
commercial controls, which wastes government and public money. This
certainly does not apply to the CITB, which is run on commercial lines, with
up-to-date management controls.
There are direct links with the industry, through the Federations' Advisory
Committee and our network of 13 regional advisory committees which includes
one for Scotland and one for Wales.
We have an independent audit committee conforming with the Cadbury Report
and which reports direct to the main board of the CITB.
On the question of accountability, an annual consensus is sought by
government from the industry before parliament is asked to renew our
statutory powers in the Annual Levy Order.
The essential factor that motivates the CITB is the need to give 'value for
money'.
Finally, in the difficult climate that the construction industry operates
under at this moment, it is agreed in the industry that without the CITB
very little training would take place and many thousands of young people
would be on the dole rather than pursuing training towards a craft
qualification. If we are a quango, we certainly do not warrant the implied
criticism of your article.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Lesson on the fax of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillow-talk should be sacrosanct. What people say to one another in intimate
mo-ments is no-body else's business. The question of the week is - how can
the personal privacy which is surely everyone's birthright be protected?
The answer is not readily apparent. It is certainly not to be found in Sir
David Calcutt's report on the British press, published yesterday. For
technology has made our bedroom walls transparent. The tapes purporting to
record conversations between Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker-Bowles
are said (nothing is sure about any of this) to have been snatched from the
airwaves by equipment able to receive and record conversations carried out
on mobile telephones. The same result might conceivably have been achieved
using other familiar gadgets, such as bugs, directional microphones, or
ordinary telephone taps. The rapid growth in use of portable phones has,
however, vastly increased the potential yield from electronic eavesdropping.
The relative cheapness of scanners and receivers has multiplied the number
of amateur listeners-in.
Add in faxes, and you change everything. Attempts to prevent disclosure of
the contents of the 'Prince Charles' tape in England would have been
difficult enough when foreign publications were willing to print the
prurient material in full, as many did. Facsimile transmission has made
effective censorship virtually impossible. Once the transcript had been
published in Australia, it was in the global public domain. Copies were
quickly faxed to friends and contacts in Britain, where most newspapers
shrank from full disclosure, at least for a while.
A slightly older device, the photocopying machine, assisted distribution in
London and elsewhere. Within half a day of the appearance of New Idea
magazine in Sydney the contents of the tape were being distributed in
buildings not five minutes' walk away from Buckingham Palace. This is the
samizdat of the western world. We may have to live with it. If we want to
stop it, we have to invent rules not yet thought of. We are confronted with
new fax of life.
Sir David's report makes a breathless attempt to catch up with these
un-pleasant side-effects of the microchip. He notes that the latest
generation of mo-bile telephones, which use digital technology, incorporates
a 'sophisticated encryption system', which will be 'beyond the means of
casual users of radio scanners to break'. Possibly, but for how long? In any
case there is no way of telling whether the snoopers who recorded the recent
conversations ascribed to both Prince Charles and Princess Diana were
'casual users' of scanners or professional spies. Lord William Rees-Mogg has
suggested that the appearance of such high-quality tapes, free of
atmospheric interference, is an indication that the security services must
have produced them. The heads of the services have denied this. We may
choose to believe them, but if the material is genuine, and if it is on some
government tape, it would take only one disgruntled spy to steal it.
In short, electronics is more powerful than the law. Sir David ruminates
about banning the sale of scanners, but acknowledges that this might be
contrary to the Treaty of Rome. I would add that, while gadgets exist,
people will find ways of acquiring them. Continental pornography is
available by satellite in Britain to those who buy unscramblers. It cannot
be kept out. Sir David notes that the Interception of Communications Act is
supposed to protect private telephone conversations. If the attorney-general
had wanted to prosecute whoever recorded the so-called Princess Diana tape
(assuming it to be a private citizen, and assuming that he or she had been
caught), it would have been necessary, he says, to establish that the
callers 'did not intend their conversation to be intercepted'. He advises
the government to think about strengthening the law on telephone bugging. It
has already accepted this advice.
It should, however, think long and hard before adopting any of Sir David's
recommendations. Fortunately the heritage secretary, Mr Peter Brooke,
intimated in the House of Commons yesterday that there is to be no statutory
press complaints tribunal. Sir David went too far there. As to the rest, the
prime minister made up his mind long before yesterday's report - probably
when the telephone conversations of his friend Mr David Mellor, the former
heritage secretary, were tapped. Physical intrusion into private property is
therefore to become a criminal offence, unless a public interest can be
shown. That means no more foot-in-the-door, bugging or stealing snapshots
with a telephoto lens. To stand a chance of being equitable, such a law
should apply to all citizens. It should not be specific to the media.
The government has been divided about a privacy law, which the lawyers in
the cabinet rightly perceive to be extremely difficult to draft. No longer.
It will now consider the idea, although Mr Brooke acknowledged that such a
law would have to take account of a wide range of 'human and technological
activity'. I have written here in favour of introducing a tort of
infringement of privacy, if it applied to ordinary citizens rather than
public figures. There would be a public interest defence. Sir David favours
something on these lines, but fails to add the other half of my proposed
trade-off: a Freedom of Information Act.
Since there is to be no such deal, the press opposition to all of Sir
David's recommendations is likely to be fierce. The Tory tabloids that
helped put the Conservatives back in office last April have been fighting
against the government for half a year now. Peace is not in sight. Yet the
press needs public support. People buy the scandal sheets, and devour their
contents, but hate the purveyors. Popular newspapers should practise the
self-restraint that they discovered for a few nervous hours as they awaited
Calcutt this week. If they do, they may yet see the proposed privacy bill
fade away.
Once I would have mourned its passing; now, under the rule of the scanner
and the fax, I wonder whether it will make any difference whether we have
one or not.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Shetlands confident of overcoming oil disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M A P MCARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The full impact of the oil spillage on the Shetland islands will not be
known for many months, perhaps years.
The oil industry is very much part of the way of life in Shetland and will
continue to be so for a long time to come. However, in addition to the
measures which have long been in place through Shetland Islands Council to
manage Sullom Voe tanker traffic, there must also be increased national and
international efforts to ensure the safe marine transportation of oil and
the protection of the environment by the introduction of additional maritime
regulations.
We must not underestimate the difficult times that we face, but neither
should we overstate them. Our economy has a solid base and we have an
excellent name for producing quality goods and providing good services. It
is very important to let everyone know that we are not going to allow this
disaster to rule us or affect the quality of any of our products or
services.
The Shetland community is made up of resilient people and we will overcome
any difficulties before us. We ask that our customers continue to have faith
in our ability to supply quality products and services.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The lure of classical Italy - William Weaver on an
exhibition touring the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the American painter Benjamin West first saw the Apollo Belvedere
during a visit to Rome in 1759, he exclaimed: 'How like a Mohawk warrior.'
What did he mean? His likening that supremely elegant classic figure, clad
only in a decorative cape, to an equally naked James Fenimore Cooperhero
wearing war-paint and feathers, showed a very 18th-century concept of
nobility and a profoundly literary attitude towards native Americans. But
the reaction also shows the long association between American artists and
Italy.
That relationship, is explored in a carefully selected exhibition first
shown at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The Lure of Italy, American Artists
and The Italian Experience 1760-1914 (it moves on to Cleveland and Houston).
West, later to settle in London, is represented by several works, including
a portrait of his wife and their oldest son, called Raphael, and as a
further homage to the Renaissance artist, West imitated the pose of the
Madonna della seggiola - a picture often copied by visiting painters to
satisfy requests from art-loving customers back home.
West studied other classical works in Rome, among them the Ara Pocis, whose
ritual procession is echoed in his neo-classical composition, Agrippina
Landing at Brindisium with the Ashes of Germanicus, painted after the artist
left Italy and settled in England. His powerful patron the Archbishop of
York, who had commissioned the picture, then presented it to the King, who
also became a patron of West's.
Foreign travellers in those days tended to give Florence short shrift while
concentrating on Rome, Naples and its nearby Pompeii and Herculaneum. Italy
represented classical civilisation and even in portraits, like the 1775 John
Singleton Copley double portrayal of the wealthy Carolina merchant Ralph
Izard and his wife, there are numerous references to Roman and Greek
culture: an urn, a column, the Colosseum in the distance and, in the middle
ground, the 1st century AD group of Orestes and Electra.
As the 19th century began, a taste for landscape developed; and Lake Nemi,
the Alban hills, the campagna with the arches of a solitary Roman aqueduct
became standard ingredients of often large paintings. The tone was even more
arcadian in the works of Thomas Cole and George Inness, major exponents of
the Hudson River school, ready to abandon the untamed nature of wild America
for Italian landscape rich in literary resonances.
One of the most revealing curiosities of the exhibition is a canvas painted
by three men (George Healy, Frederic Church and Jarvis McEntee) in 1871,
entitled 'Arch of Titus'. The arch, framing the colosseum, is certainly the
protagonist of the picture, but it also depicts two contemporary groups;
one, in the right foreground, comprises the three artists; in the other
shows an elderly, white-bearded man strolling with a blond young girl. They
are the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his daughter Edith. Though
Longfellow had unkind things to say about Italy he was a devoted scholar of
Italian culture and a thoughtful translator of Dante.
Appreciation of American 19th century sculpture has lagged behind studies of
the painting of the period; but this exhibition devotes considerable space
to the works of Horatio Greenough (a Canova-like, idealised George
Washington), Thomas Crawford, William Wertmore Story, Harriet Hosmer and
Randolph Rogers.
Some Americans lived in Italy while remaining indifferent to modern Italy;
but others shared in the turmoil and excitement of the Risorgimento years.
There are occasional reflections of 19th century reality among the works to
be seen: Albert Bierstadt's genre scene at the Portico d'Ottavio fish-market
has a Fellinian vivacity, and Martin Johnson Heade's 'Roman Newsboys',
showing two urchins against a wall with Risorgimento graffiti, is perhaps an
indirect tribute to the brief Roman republic of 1848-49 , which allowed a
free press and the publication of Don Pirione, the satirical sheet that the
boys are selling.
By the end of the century, the capital of expatriate artists had moved to
Venice, where American hostesses fought over Henry James and Robert
Browning, where Whistler visited briefly, as did the neo-impressionist
Maurice Prendergast. The Italian-born, cosmopolitan John Singer Sargent paid
long visits to Venice, as he did to Rome. The Whistlers and Sargents in this
show are particularly appealing.
Prepared bu Boston curator Theodore Stebbins, also responsible for the fine
catalogue, The Lure of Italy opens at the Cleveland Museum in February, and
in May it goes to Houston for six weeks.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The ENO's car-lot 'Carmen' returns - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Pountney's car-lot Carmen, first seen in 1986, has been revived for a
second time by English National Opera. Those who were repelled by it on
previous occasions will
no doubt stay well clear,
but they will deprive themselves of some first-rate performances, not just
from Sally Burgess in her return to the title role, but from almost every
other member of the cast too.
Truth to tell, Pountney's translations of period and place do very little to
illuminate the drama, and perhaps only emphasise that the central issues of
Carmen are timeless ones. The urban debris of Maria Bjornson's set adds
little save a generalised clutter, and
for all that modish detail Pountney's production functions very much like a
run-of-the mill neo-realist show. It is post-modernism without any teeth, or
a meaningful agenda. Perhaps it is just meant as a send-up, but at least it
is one that
has the tact to recognise
those moments in the opera when real emotions come through. Nothing is done
to upset Bizet's careful
pacing and the musical text seems a correct, uncontentious one.
It is the energy of the revival, supervised by David Sulkin, that sustains
the evening most effectively. Justin Brown conducts a very serviceable
account that may not always be absolutely idiomatic but recognises that
there is no space in this show for contemplation. The pace is never allowed
to slacken, and the bustling detail that has gone into the chorus work is
vividly portrayed; the ENO chorus and the splendid children's groups work
very hard indeed.
So too do the principals. Burgess's predatory, physical, exciting Carmen is
presented with extraordinary vividness, every element of her singing, acting
and, crucially speaking, is charged with intensity. She is well matched to
Edmund Barham's Don Jose (new to the production). He sings with massive
assurance and much style, and visually gives every sense of a hopeless,
doomed victim, with no feeling of male superiority here.
There is a nicely frumpy Micaela from Cathryn Pope, a splendid tarty pair of
gypsies from Ethna Robinson and Maria Moll and a growling, convincing Zuniga
from Richard Angas. The party piece, though, is
Donald Maxwell's glitter-rock Escamillo, all camp and coiff, and positively
poured into his skin-tight trousers.
Like all jokes, one suspects, the production itself does not repay repeated
scrutiny. But the performances do, and that of Ms Burgess especially, which
seems to grow steadily in command and compelling intensity.
London Coliseum; performances until February 26. Revival sponsored by
Guinness plc

This looks like a night to spend just about anywhere other than in front of
the box. However, it is a different story if you are minded to listen to
Tyndale's Testament (Radio 3, 10.45). William Tyndale eminently deserves to
be resurrected from the dog-eared pages of history text-books. A good
scholar and a most courageous man, Tyndale was responsible for the first
complete translation of the Bible into English and tonight's programme
salutes his profound, if unrecognised, influence on English language and
literature.
If you admire people with a creative flair for handling money, the programme
to watch is Arena: On the Road with Boggs (BBC 2, 9.30). J. S. G. Boggs is
the American artist who draws and colours his own dollar-bills and spends
them as a form of 'performance art' which allows him to be remunerated more
handsomely than are most poverty-stricken performance artists. Collectors of
Boggs's work are set a merry dance as they try to track down Boggs-bills
using the receipts which the artist always asks for and which then, together
with the loose change, become part of the art-work.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The new bible for opera lovers - Max Loppert reviews
the latest dictionary in the Grove opus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The original Grove was Sir George (1820-1900). He was a very Victorian sort
of polymath: a builder of bridges and lighthouses by profession, a
passionate amateur of the arts who inter multa alia conceived of and edited
the very first Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians.
This was published piecemeal from 1879 onwards, and in complete form in
1890. So far, there have been six editions of the Dictionary. The first five
remained more or less small operations under the control of a single editor.
Then came Grove 6, published in 1980, and running to 20 volumes, far more
than originally planned; it was edited by not just a main 'Grove' - Stanley
Sadie - but by three senior consulting 'Groves' and 32 executive 'Grovelets'
in tandem. These facts, and the re-naming of Grove 6 as The New Grove
Dictionary of Music and Musicians (because almost all articles had of
necessity been newly commissioned), may stand as symbols of the growth in
the amount and kind of information on musical subjects ready and waiting to
be codified to the taste of the late-20th century.
It did not stop there: Grove 6 engendered a mass of offshoots (long articles
published as separate paperbacks), and then a couple of bigger developments
 -among them The New Grove Dictionary of American Music - requiring material
new as well as redeployed.
Now comes the latest epic of musical explication linking the Macmillan
publishing company to the Grove name. Opera Grove is likewise edited by Dr
Sadie, decked with editorial assistants, and longer than originally
intended. It follows the Grove 6 layout and model, and claims 'New' in its
title for much the same reason as did Grove 6. That is to say: roughly 90
per cent of the articles have been newly commissioned, with the remainder
reprinted from Grove 6 (and, on occasion, altered and/or cut without the
original writer's sanction, as I can personally testify).
On the other hand, the four volumes stand taller and look even handsomer
than the 20 of Grove 6 (plush red instead of plain brown covers, gilt
topping). The statistics relating to their contents - more than 5,700 pages,
nearly 3,000 entries on composers and more than 2,500 on singers alone, with
many others on related opera performers and departments, technical terms,
theatres and cities with operatic links and traditions - are astonishing.
But then, this is altogether a pretty astonishing achievement. The meat of
Opera Grove lies in its general articles - 'Opera' itself, 'Libretto' (the
longest in the dictionary), 'Criticism', 'Production', 'Stage Design',
'Sociology of opera', and (for its good humour and good sense) Lord
Harewood's 'Casting' are just some I particularly admire - and in its
entries on the composers. These latter stretch wide across the historical
span, from the greats to the marginals, from Mozart to the 17th-century
Italian Abbatini and the 19th-century Czech Josef Leopold Zvonar. New to
Opera Grove, and hugely valuable, are the pieces on the most important
individual operas of those composers - from Figaro to Paliashvili's Abesalom
da Eteri and Schubert's Die Zwillingsbruder.
The more prominent the composer, the longer and more copiously detailed the
entry. Ditto the operas themselves. Complaint about the inclusion of
lesser-known figures and works from the past seems to me shortsighted; after
all, today's Legrenzi may become tomorrow's Cavalli, once some opera or
recording company has newly revealed his merits.
Up-to-date-ness has been achieved, sometimes quite remarkably. William
Bolcom, whose first full-scale opera, McTeague, had its premiere last
October, is in, with eight sensible lines of description on the new opera
itself. Indeed, of the noteworthy composers of new operas I have encountered
in recent years, only the young Swede Hans Gefors (composer of Christina)
and the American Meredith Monk (creator of and performer in Atlas) lack
entries.
This suggests a degree of consistency that, unfortunately, has not been
achieved in other subsidiary departments. In his Preface Dr Sadie neatly
pre-empts possible criticism on this score: 'The New Grove Dictionary of
Opera has been written by some 1,300 people and it no doubt embodies many
contradictions.'
Nevertheless, the degree and type of inconsistency between articles prove
far more considerable than this would seem to suggest. There is a sharp
disparity of 'tone' between the most abstruse theoretical discussions (eg
'Analysis'), which seem to have been directed by one academic at another,
and most of the rest.
As I recall them (having contributed sections 6 and 7 of 'Gluck'), the Opera
Grove author guidelines were primarily concerned with (house-)style, not
substance. For the author this meant welcome freedom from stringent
formula-fulfilment; but it has led to a variation in the balance struck
between information and evaluation from article to article that will perhaps
prove not so welcome to the amateur or newcomer to the subject.
My FT colleagues David Murray ('Strauss', full of elegantly expressed,
theatre-tested perceptions) and Andrew Clements ('Berg', 'Henze' and several
later 20th-century figures) are among those who seem to me to get the
balance right. Other longer articles I have read that 'say something' beyond
the merely factual include Rodney Milnes's characteristically zestful
polemic in defence of Massenet, Richard Taruskin brilliantly acute on
Prokofiev and Mussorgsky, Julian Budden re-evaluating Puccini with
magisterial clarity and fairness, Amanda Glauert's judicious survey of
Humperdinck, Richard Osborne's unfailingly lively 'Rossini'; by contrast,
Julian Rushton ('Mozart') and Anthony Hicks ('Handel'), both undoubtedly
scholarly in their grasp of fact and text, fail to illuminate their subjects
as it were from within.
A more serious inconsistency arises in the longer single-work entries. Some
give the details of first casts and those of important revivals, some do
not. Some indicate key recordings, all the more important when the work is a
rarity, some do not. This particular failure, an editorial rather than an
authorial one, is significant. Recordings are for many people the main entry
into the world of opera; the Opera Grove supply of discographical
information is at once parsimonious and frustratingly uneven, leading to the
curious situation that so huge and fact-filled a dictionary on opera should
nevertheless require other sources of basic information to supplement it. I
would have been happy to sacrifice the all-too-numerous entries on minor
British singers to fill in at least the basic gaps.
In the matter of the singers' entries, the inconsistencies are of a
different but even more troubling order: a favouritism amounting at times to
absurdity in coverage of the British, and the sheer disparity in quality
between the most illuminating pieces and the thuddingly unilluminating ones
 -the latter unfortunately far more generously supplied.
All dictionary-reviewers play the inclusion-exclusion game, and no doubt Dr
Sadie is already hardened to its niggly results; but - just to take the
example of lower-voiced male singers - it seems to me incomprehensible that
the Englishmen Roderick Kennedy, Roderick Earle and Matthew Best, honourable
second-rankers all, should have been included (with, however, no mention of
Mr Best's conducting sideline) when no place was found for the Frenchman
Francois Le Roux (leading Pelleas of our day), the Russian Vladimir Chernov
(newest important 'Italian' baritone), or the German Franz Grundheber
(leading Wozzeck of our day).
What distinguishes the illuminating singer's entry from the opposite kind is
difficult to analyse. Still, when examples lie to hand of J. B. Steane and
Desmond Shawe-Taylor at their most discerning on the 'historicals', the
reader may well come to regret all the more the prosaic stuff that is poured
out to serve the current crop of singers. So many of them are deemed in some
way 'ideal' or 'unrivalled' that the epithets soon lose their clout. This is
clearly a part of the same 'feel-good' factor that caused, say, Alan Blyth's
vivid Grove 6 summing-up of Gwyneth Jones to lose all mention of the
'uncomfortable beat' in her tone when re-cycled in Opera Grove; and it often
leads to the evasion of all 'negative' characteristics, even when these are
common knowledge.
The situation with regard to other operatic executants is less vexed. Barry
Millington's accounts of 'controversial' producers such as Ruth Berghaus are
a pleasure to read for their lucid, balanced judgment. But still, the matter
of who gets in and who does not causes puzzlements. Conductors: Lionel
Friend but no Michel Plasson, Mark Ermler, Carlo Rizzi, Paul Daniel, or the
late Pierre Dervaux or Charles Groves (musical head of two British opera
companies during his lifetime).
Opera-house bosses: the ENO men Arlen, Harewood and Jonas, quite properly,
but no Jeremy Isaacs, Nicholas Payne or Elaine Padmore. Critics require also
to have produced books or translations to find a place; so it is odd that
the FT's Ronald Crichton, William Weaver and Paul Griffiths, all three
authors of studies with direct operatic connections, have not. As for Dr
Sadie's decision to exclude himself, this is modesty gone mad]
Even after so short an acquaintanceship with Opera Grove, I feel strongly
that its editorial team badly needed - but failed ever to acquire - the
dictionary equivalent of the cinematic Continuity Girl or Boy hovering
around the set to ensure that scenes matched up when filmed out of order.
Opera Grove has already been attacked, from the loonier fringes of opera
criticism, for an 'ideological bias' that runs counter to the notion of
opera-as-theatre. For this to be the case, the dictionary would have to show
much more care and consistency in organisation and content.
Perhaps this is its saving grace. Probably a more consistent Opera Grove
could only have been created by a race of operatic Ubermenschen. Much of it
suggests it has been so created: that is the wonder of the achievement. The
latest Grove issue keeps faith with the lighthouse and bridge-building
spirit and enterprise of its founding father: it is a monument to the most
unstable, labour-intensive, perpetually controversial and grandest of the
Western performing arts.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology: A new player on the tennis court - At the
Australian Open, beginning Monday, a computer will be calling the shots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps when John McEnroe retired from full-time professional tennis last
December, he stopped too soon. Next Monday, the Australian Open tennis
championships begin at Flinders Park in Melbourne, using a computerised
system derived from a weapons tracking machine to call the lines. No more
linespeople. No more disputed calls. No more arguments with the umpire.
The technology to be used on the three main show courts at Flinders Park has
taken five years to develop. It requires costly alterations to the existing
courts, but should save frazzled umpires working in heats of up to 100 deg F
from disputes.
In tennis, a ball that touches any part of the line - however narrowly  - is
in; but deciding that with a ball travelling at up to 100 mph exhausts the
human eye. Also, two people in different places can see two results, leading
to the sort of arguments that McEnroe became so notorious for in his time.
The new system was developed by John Baxter and Bruce Candy at an
Adelaide-based company called Tel (for Tennis Electronic Lines), where they
applied their knowledge of weapons detection and radio systems to tennis.
The entire court on which the system is to be used must first be relaid.
Flat cables 60 centimetres wide are set about one cm underneath the
positions where the lines (about five cm wide) will be. Then the new court
(of rubberised concrete in the case of Flinders Park) is poured on and the
lines painted down the centres of the cables. The cost of doing that on the
three show courts at Flinders Park came to more than Pounds 130,000.
The rubber cores of the tennis balls to be used incorporate a tiny quantity
of iron particles - not enough to alter their playing characteristics, but
sufficient to disturb a magnetic field (generated by an electric current)
around the lines.
An on-court computer monitors these variations and decides where, over 30 cm
either side of the line, the ball hit the court. The result is fed to a
monitor at the umpire's chair. Tel says it is accurate to within three
millimetres; only the best linespeople are consistently accurate to within a
centimetre.
The system was used at last September's US Open which, like the Australian
Open and Wimbledon, is one of the four main 'Grand Slam' tournaments in the
tennis calendar. Although the Australian authorities intend this year to use
it only in the over-35s event, Geoff Pollard, chief executive of Tennis
Australia, which runs the tournament, says: 'It's years ahead of anything
else, and we would not be bothering to experiment with it if in a couple of
years we did not intend to use it.'
Pollard acknowledges that the system 'has the potential to eradicate
disputes over line calls forever' but also that it 'raises questions about
the future culture of professional tennis'.
Brian Williams, managing director of Tel, is seeking an agreement from the
Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men's professional game.
'I'm waiting for their approval of it for international play,' he says.
'That has been the hardest part - not the development, but the politics. The
ATP is afraid that players will demand it on all courts, which would put
quite a financial burden on tournaments.' But it would cut the number of
linespeople needed on a court significantly - from the usual complement of
the umpire and 10 people to the umpire, net-cord judge and foot-fault judge
(on the baseline). And for Tel, equipping the 81 men's events and 60 women's
events would be a financial bonanza.
However, because Tel presently cannot function on the portable courts
commonly used during the indoor season of the men's game, that prospect may
be a little way off. Williams reckons it will cost another year and ADollars
500,000 (Pounds 225,000) to develop such a system; after the ADollars 4.5m
that has gone into development so far, that will not seem much. And he also
expects soon to be installing the system on clay courts in Monte Carlo, and
possibly later underneath grass courts.
The signs are that the professionals at least will quickly adapt to a system
without human frailty. They have long since grown used to the 'Cyclops'
machine, which is used to call the service line - which the ball crosses at
up to 130mph - at most major tournaments. This uses four laser beams
crossing the court on and near the line; depending which order the ball
breaks them, the system deduces whether the ball was in or not.
Cyclops first came into use in 1980, and most players accepted it as an
accurate arbiter - even McEnroe. But some people are never satisfied. Once,
he complained during a match that it was giving wrong calls: 'I don't want
to sound paranoid,' he said later, 'but that machine knows who I am.'

<TEXT>
To guard against leakages of toxic or flammable materials, David Brown Pumps
has introduced a device which can be attached to a standard double seal
assembly on any pump. It eliminates leaks of liquids or gases during the
pump's operation and shuts down in the event of failure.
The unit is designed to operate under any pressure (however wildly
fluctuating), with any fluid (however dirty), and at any temperature
(however extreme). It uses a piston, moving vertically in a cylinder, to
separate a clean barrier fluid above from the hazardous fluid transported
below. It needs no electrical power, air or coolant supply. David Brown: UK,

ICOS sees a growing market in training programmers from eastern Europe. That

Paradox, a database language for PCs. 'The biggest obstacle was the language
barrier,' says Ian Lucas, ICOS training manager. 'All communication was

English Architectural Glazing has developed a blast-resistant glazed
cladding system, providing extra protection against bomb attack, writes
Richard Lapper. EAG's glass cladding is designed to bend rather than
fracture with the force of a blast - like a tennis racket hit by a ball.
The system uses frames of a special aluminium alloy. Transoms and mullions
are marginally wider than those used in conventional building design,
helping keep the glass in its frame. But Norman Sheldrake, managing
director, says they are narrower than in other blast-proof cladding systems.
The EAG system differs little in appearance or cost from standard claddings.

FT  15 JAN 93 / The Property Market: The final curtain call - Vanessa
Houlder on MEPC's outgoing chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Benson, the outgoing chairman of MEPC, Britain's second
largest property group, does not view next week's annual general meeting
with his usual equanimity.
He is bracing himself for a possible intervention at the behest of Mr Harry
Hyams, the reclusive post-war developer of Centre Point in London who is one
of MEPC's most critical shareholders. 'I would be surprised if Harry Hyams
did not orchestrate something,' says Sir Christopher.
A year ago four associates of Mr Hyams, owner of 6.6 per cent of MEPC,
challenged the payment of an increased dividend. Sir Christopher has few
doubts about the strength of Mr Hyams' feelings. Shortly before last year's
agm, Mr Hyams set out his thoughts on MEPC's philosophy and management style
in a 40-minute telephone conversion with Sir Christopher which the MEPC boss
describes as 'very critical and passionate'. In the exchange, Mr Hyams said
he was 'incredulous' that Sir Christopher had the gall to describe MEPC's
1991 results as creditable. MEPC's pre-tax profits fell 4.3 per cent to
Pounds 143.3m in 1991.
The differences between Mr Hyams and Sir Christopher date back at least to
1987 when MEPC bought Mr Hyams' company Oldham Estates in a hostile Pounds
530m deal.
'The wounds have not healed . . .he is a very bitter man,' says Sir
Christopher, although he professes to admire his critic.
The substance of the argument between Mr Hyams and Sir Christopher is one of
corporate strategy and philosophy rather than personality. Mr Hyams' policy
has always been one of ensuring security of income by letting to tenants of
undoubted quality. While the value of this strategy has become apparent over
the past three years, it is sometimes dubbed as an uncreative,
'rent-collecting' approach. Indeed, Mr Hyams' refusal to take a more
aggressive strategy in the redevelopment of his portfolio paved the way for
MEPC's takeover of Oldham Estates.
MEPC, by contrast, believes in trying to add value to its buildings. 'We
want to take a building and do something to improve it. If it is not
improvable we sell it,' says Sir Christopher.
The clash between these two cultures became apparent in Mr Hyams' objection
to MEPC's sale last year of a 1960s Croydon office building that was let to
the government. MEPC sold it because it thought that the building had no
prospects for rental growth and the company wished to contain its borrowing.
Mr Hyams said the disposal amounted to selling good assets in a weak market
for short-term gain.
The difference of opinion over the sale of the Croydon site was not the
first time that Sir Christopher has had to defend MEPC's strategy since he
joined the board in 1974.
His early years at the company were spent travelling the world persuading
banks to back MEPC, which had overextended itself. Much of his time was also
taken up troubleshooting in continental Europe and Australia.
In the late 1970s, the company decided to expand its US portfolio, a
decision which led to heavy losses when the Texas real estate market slumped
in the early 1980s. 'The timing was exquisitely wrong,' admits Sir
Christopher.
More recently, MEPC's development programme in the City of London has also
come under fire from analysts. 'The management's decision to expand in the
City was clearly a major strategic error . . . While MEPC's financial
management is very astute, the direction of its property activities seems to
be badly flawed,' said Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, in 1991.
The timing of MEPC's development programme and high exposure to office
markets in general were widely criticised and its share price badly
underperformed for much of 1991 and 1992. Towards the end of last year,
however, MEPC's shares were re-rated after the company showed that it had
sharply reduced its vacancy rate and was able to maintain its dividend
payment.
Perhaps the most important recent factor in improving MEPC's accident-prone
image was the letting of a large part of Alban Gate, the MEPC development
straddling London Wall which for a time looked like attracting the label of
the City's largest white elephant. Alban Gate's fortunes revived last
September when it signed up Chemical Bank as a tenant. The US bank had
previously intended to move to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project in
the London docklands.
There is a certain irony in the fact that the recent success of Alban Gate
has been at the cost of the docklands: Sir Christopher chaired the London
Docklands Development Corporation from 1984 to 1988, a job for which he was
awarded a knighthood.
The mid-1980s was a period of rapid expansion for the docklands and Canary
Wharf was the region's most ambitious development. The period was also one
in which the pace of development in the docklands ran well ahead of the
area's infrastructure development and demand from tenants. Despite his deep
involvement in the docklands, Sir Christopher views the mid-1980s period
with a curious detachment. 'I still have some difficulty with the speed of
what happened,' he says.
Sir Christopher's role at the LDDC prompted some City critics to suggest
that he was spreading his time too thinly. Those criticisms and Sir
Christopher's readiness to become involved in a host of companies continued
after he gave up the managing directorship of MEPC in 1988. He took on the
job of executive chairman of MEPC at the same time; this summer he takes his
leave, to be succeeded by Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson (owner of the
Financial Times).
Although Sir Chris is retiring from MEPC, he will remain active in the City.
In 1990 he became chairman of the Housing Corporation, the quango which
supervises housing associations, and chairman of Boots, the UK chemist. He
is also vice-chairman of Sun Alliance, the insurance company where he is
tipped to become chairman.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology: An Olympic paperchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first race of the 2000 Olympics begins on February 1. On that Monday,
each city competing for the Games has to submit 30 copies of its final draft
bid document to the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.
This will be equivalent to Beijing, Berlin, Brasilia, Manchester, Milan and
Sydney taking to their marks. They will be held in the 'set' position for
two weeks while IOC officials decide what amendments they want. The winner
will be the first to produce 300 copies of an amended, completed document.
The prize will be the undivided attention of IOC members before the
second-placed city's bid arrives. The IOC will make its choice of venue for
the 2000 Olympics as early as September of this year.
The IOC wants simple bid documents in standard A4 size, printed on both
sides to reduce weight and designed to make it easy to copy broken-out
sections for experts to study particular details.
Since each bid document will run to hundreds of pages and several volumes,
the race is a production management challenge. Manchester has decided to do
the job in six days with the help of Rank Xerox.
Its bid document will total 520 pages in three volumes, with parallel
columns of English and French. Since some sections and illustrations will be
in colour, potential problems seem enormous. If text is lengthened or
shortened, or some illustrations have to be changed or dropped, the whole
running order of pages could be affected.
Conventional printing methods could make this a nightmare. Just getting the
imposition of pages correct on the presses, so they appeared in correct
order in the finished product, would be difficult in a rush. Remaking
hundreds of printing plates would also be time-consuming and expensive.
Manchester's approach will be to marry the converging high technologies of
laser scanning and printing with photocopying, so that printing presses -
and plates for them - will not be involved.
Russell Forsyth, Xerox's accounts manager for local government, claims the
combination of kit assembled in Manchester is unique. It uses the
flexibility of a unix operating system, combining Apple and Hewlett Packard
equipment with Rank Xerox's own.
Pictures, artwork and graphics can be scanned in, while text comes in
word-processed, digital form. Rank Xerox's own cut and paste system allows
electronic assembly and page editing, while computerised imposition makes
sure they are produced and copied in the right order. Programmed collation
puts them together, while automatic binding turns them into book form.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Management: Stirring up the waters - Yorkshire Water is
peeling away layers of old management thinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The difficult transition from public to private ownership has thrown up
strange watchwords at Yorkshire Water, one of Britain's 10 water and sewage
companies privatised in 1989. Onions, Maces and Matsushita are just some of
the management tools Yorkshire hopes will prompt a revolution.
Yorkshire's problem, according to senior managers, is that the structure and
ethos inherited from pre-privatisation days do not suit the private sector.
In places the company is overmanned and inefficient. Its management style
remains too hierarchical, with little information flow except from top to
bottom.
'As an ex-public sector, ex-nationalised industry, we have an attitude of
saying 'No',' according to Trevor Newton, group managing director.
Since 1990 Yorkshire has hired management consultants, sent Newton to
Harvard University for three months and organised a series of workshops for
managers. As a result, it has introduced a three-pronged plan - probably the
most radical in the water industry - to restructure its business and change
its culture.
The first prong, known as Onion, will strip away non-essential services,
such as pipe laying, from the 'core', regulated business. These services
will have to compete in the private sector or be closed.
Last year, Yorkshire and its consultants decided that 21 of its 40 areas of
business, or about 65 per cent of employees, could - over time - be put
outside the core.
From next April, Yorkshire will change its structure from one based on 10
geographical regions to one based on functions, like water resources. About
100 middle to senior managers will leave the company through voluntary
severance because of the change.
The largest business so far placed outside the core is Leeds Pipeline
Services, a new company made up of about 60 former employees, involved in
laying and maintaining water mains. It still relies on contracts from the
core for most of its business. But John Fenwick, operations manager, hopes
to increase non-core work to 20 per cent in the next few years.
Because work is now carried out at market prices, rather than cost, there is
an incentive for LPS to maximise profit by finishing contracts early. Strict
job demarcation rules have been changed and efficiency gains, which used to
lead to job cuts, now mean LPS can bid for more work. Fenwick estimated time
lost due to sickness and other absences has been cut by 100 hours to 150
hours a week.
Previously sceptical employees are beginning to accept the changes. Steve
Pennistone, a senior shop steward, said: 'So far they've stuck to their
promises. It's running much more efficiently and the lads are doing better
out of it.'
A Pounds 750 bonus paid because performance was ahead of targets helped win
employee support. Staff also noticed LPS continued to recruit workers when
other companies in Leeds were laying them off.
Some employees are less happy, complaining that the drive for profits will
compromise service and quality. Others say the new system has created
divisions within Yorkshire Water and its management. And the hidden costs of
contracting out - such as stricter and more costly monitoring of
contractors' performance - are not yet visible.
John Taylor, Yorkshire's deputy managing director, acknowledged that forcing
change could be disruptive. But he hopes LPS's example will prove a strong
incentive. Another understated incentive is that areas which do not welcome
change could lose work and jobs to areas which do.
Yorkshire's second prong is Mace, an acronym for a Pounds 75m new technology
programme which could lead to greater efficiencies and further contracting
out of tasks. One area being studied, for example, is the use of sensors and
telemetry to identify illegal toxic waste before it reaches a sewage plant
and relay this information to a central control. The sewage treatment
process could then be adjusted remotely.
If they are to succeed, Onion and Mace require another change - in
Yorkshire's managers and staff. Although progress was made in the 1980s,
Newton believes the company is still too hierarchical. Communication between
employees and managers is poor, achievement often goes unrewarded and ideas
still largely come from the top.
This works against Onion and dilutes Mace. Water companies are also being
told by the regulator to improve customer service standards, so Yorkshire
and its employees have to become more open and responsive to change.
The new strategy was presented to Yorkshire's 100 senior managers in
February 1991. They were told to spread cultural change through the company,
'energise' their people, be more positive, communicate with and empower
their staff and recognise their successes. Drawing on the example of
Matsushita, the Japanese electronics company, Yorkshire employees were told
that profit was a by-product of business, not the only aim.
The response was mixed. Newton said that about 50 of Yorkshire's 100 senior
managers agree fully with the changes.
Ideas are starting to flow up management lines instead of down and managers
are learning to recognise and reward good work. Most recognition is
informal, like 'saying 'thank you' and drinks after work', Newton said. A
financial reward system, which only applied to senior management, has been
scrapped. Instead, Yorkshire is studying a company-wide system based on
performance.
There has been opposition among some managers to specific changes, for
example an annual company-wide opinion survey asking employees what they
thought of their managers.
Newton's zest for change has led to uncertainty about job security. His
methods have also been unconventional. For example, he issued a memo banning
team briefings in order 'to improve communications'. He felt Yorkshire's
team briefings did not work because they only allowed information to flow
from the top downwards.
Yorkshire has organised 'learning, coaching and counselling' sessions where
staff are taught what to expect of managers under the new system. 'The way
to change managers is to change the expectations of their people,' according
to Newton.
But he and his fellow converts admit, as products of the hierarchical public
sector themselves, that some managers will never change. 'I've also been
brought up in an environment of shouting at people to get things done. Some
people don't recognise this has to change. They will either get driven out
by their people, or by me.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Management: Why actions really do speak louder than words -
Christopher Lorenz challenges a new business thesis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLDS of religion and politics are littered with living examples of the
dictum that there is nothing more powerful - nor, sometimes, more dangerous
 -than the dogma of a convert. In management, the same phenomenon makes far
too many executives chase in zig-zag fashion after such either-or dogmas as
organisational decentralisation or centralisation, diversity or focus, and
employee involvement or control.
The self-delusion - and corporate risk-taking - practised by such managerial
fashion followers is the target of an ambitious new book, Beyond the Hype*,
which has caused quite a stir in the US, especially around its three
authors' home base of the Harvard Business School. Its central message is
undoubtedly sensible: that persuasive language (or 'rhetoric') plays an
under-valued part in management. But the book's impact is diminished by its
own degree of dogmatism. That, in turn, flows from the fact that its two
main authors, Robert Eccles and Nitin Nohria, are themselves fresh converts
from the hype which they now criticise.
Two years ago, when most business academics were waxing lyrical about the
need for 'new managerial practices for an age of new organisations', Eccles
and Nohria wrote a working paper called 'the post-structuralist
organisation' on life after bureaucracy.
But within five months they began to doubt their case. This was partly
because they found less new actual organisational practice than they had
expected and partly because they became smitten by rhetorical theory. They
concluded that, though the rhetoric of management has changed sharply in
recent decades, its actual principles and practice have stayed very much the
same. 'Leading-edge companies are not doing anything very different,' they
claim.
Among today's 'new' management concepts which turn out to have been quite
common throughout this century, Eccles and Nohria cite cross-functional
collaboration plus the production of quality products and the provision of
responsive customer service. 'Who could argue with such advice?' asks the
duo. 'When did managers think - let alone say - they were doing otherwise?'
Think about the last question for a moment, and you will see Eccles and
Nohria sliding off the rails - gently in their assault on the oldness of
'new' principles, but painfully in their suggestion that there is nothing
new in 'new' practices.
Their assertion that there are few new management concepts may shock
ill-informed executives who have gleaned their ideas from airport bookstalls
and the more superficial type of business school courses. But well-read
managers, gurus and academics will be entirely unsurprised.
One of the chief butts of their criticism, Tom Peters, the guru, has always
been the first to credit the early progenitors of many of the concepts to
which he and others today attach jazzy new names.
What Peters and the best of his fellow pundits have done is not just to
re-name and regurgitate old concepts, as Eccles and Nohria suggest. Instead,
they have made some of them comprehensible to lay people and re-worked
others to adapt them to today's context.
Thus the concept of corporate 'core competences', popularised in the last
couple of years to great effect by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel, may well
have been developed from the ideas of more than 30 years ago. But their new
formulation has an added twist to it: the notion that a company's
competence, however strong, is of little value unless it is so distinctive
as to be virtually unique.
So much for rhetoric. When it comes to real action the Eccles-Nohria case
quite jumps the rails.
It is plain wrong to claim that companies have always been as concerned as
they are now with quality and customer-responsiveness, let alone with
performance-related rewards and social responsibility. Small, leading-edge
enterprises, perhaps, plus a few highly-adaptive large ones, such as 3M.
But if this were really true for a broad swathe of US companies, they would
never have alienated millions of customers by producing so many
ill-designed, poor quality cars, air-conditioners and other products in the
1960s and 1970s, leaving a yawning door for the Japanese to push open. Just
because ideas similar to today's have been expressed intermittently
throughout the century does not mean that they have been practised widely -
far from it.
The same goes for all the 'human resources' (people) aspects of today's
organisational principles and practices. Just because delegation and
cross-functional communication - two principles of 'empowered' and
'horizontal' organisations - have been bandied about since the 1920s, it
does not mean they have been thick on the ground in reality.
What has altered the way executives do their jobs has been the changing
practical context within which such principles are now propagated. Terms
such as 'delegation' meant one thing to managers within the sort of
steeply-hierarchical bureaucracy typical of the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s.
They mean quite another (and much more) within today's shallow, delayered
hierarchies, where instead of having only five people reporting to them,
many managers now have 25 or more. In such circumstances, delegated
authority and decentralised responsibility really do mean what they say.
Which leaves one with the thought that the Eccles-Nohria argument should
sometimes be stood on its head. Rather than rhetoric being forever changed
to reflect the unaltered 'essence of management', as they put it, language
often changes more slowly than the managerial behaviour which it describes.
Harvard professors, please take note.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Some BCCI creditors want more: Richard Donkin on a group
resisting the planned settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH Court hearing today may shed some light on one of the more puzzling
aspects of the BCCI affair - why a group of creditors is continuing to
resist the compensation agreement negotiated by the liquidator and the Abu
Dhabi majority shareholders.
Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator of the bank, appears to
have a powerful case for settling with Abu Dhabi. He says he has negotiated
the best deal available - a Dollars 1.7bn contribution from the emirate and
a payout for creditors of 30p to 40p in the pound.
He came close to despair last month when three BCCI creditors filed an
appeal against the Luxembourg court approval of the agreement.
The most prominent of the appellants is Mr Adil Elias, a 40-year-old
engineering consultant who lives in Orlando, Florida, where his company,
Ronical International, is based.
Since 1975, when he gained a doctorate in mechanical engineering at the
University of London, he has specialised in the study of air pollution and
alternative fuels.
Mr Elias and his family lost more than Dollars 1m at the Edgware Road,
London, branch of BCCI, which he used because of the bank's branch network
in the Middle East.
Almost a month before the BCCI closedown, the controversy surrounding the
bank led him to instruct his branch to move his assets to Barclays.
'Stupidly I allowed them (BCCI) to stop the instructions,' he said.
Since the BCCI collapse in July 1991 he has devoted much of his time to the
liquidation. In July he sold his home to help finance legal action. 'I will
sell my new home, too, if I have to,' he said.
As chairman of the BCCI Depositors Protection Association, he is at the
forefront of a campaign against the compensation agreement. Mr Elias says
'more than hundreds' of BCCI depositors feel the same way about the
agreement.
The liquidators point to a Luxembourg court consultation among depositors -
21,000 replied, 94 per cent in favour.
That apparent endorsement may have influenced the UK liquidator to seek
court directions on whether to call a creditors' meeting to elect a
liquidation committee for BCCI SA.
Mr Elias, a member of the two current creditors' committees, believes that
the liquidator are hoping that such a meeting would not elect him to a new
committee, effectively reducing his influence.
There seems little doubt that the liquidators view him as a thorn in their
side. Both he and they insist they want the best deal possible for
creditors, but they diverge on strategy.
Mr Elias believes Abu Dhabi is being too cosily accommodated in the
liquidation. He says the emirate could be forced to pay a larger
contribution were it sued in the US under punitive civil laws that provide
for triple damages. Mr Smouha believes that civil action against Abu Dhabi
would be lengthy, costly and too much of a gamble.
Mr Elias's hand would be strengthened if indictments were issued in the US
against any member of the Abu Dhabi administration.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has launched a campaign to recruit
members among suppliers to Nissan in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes.
The AEEU is the only union recognised by the management at Nissan's
Sunderland car plant, and its growth in membership there - to about 2,000
out of 4,600 employees - has helped to maintain its Tyneside numbers against
a declining national trend.
The union hopes that by recruiting members at Nissan suppliers it will
strengthen its request for recognition by managements, many of which
rebuffed formal AEEU approaches when they moved into the area.
At Nissan's Sunderland plant the works council, not the union, negotiates
pay and conditions, although some elected representatives are AEEU members.

FT  15 JAN 93 / People: 'Heavyweights with strong views' picked for
Arjo-Wiggins Appleton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arjo-Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has made a series of
appointments which it hopes will reassure its British shareholders.
Last year the company had a torrid relationship with its main shareholders
following the sacking of its British chief executive, the resignation of a
senior British non-executive director and its decision to cut the dividend.
So now AWA has appointed two British non-executive directors, George Loudon
(pictured right) and Sir Charles Powell, both described by the company as
'heavyweights with strong views'.
These appointments redress the balance on the board between French and
British non-executives to three each.
British investors have been concerned that St Louis, a French group with
39.6 per cent of AWA's shares, has been exercising too much control, to the
detriment of majority shareholders.
Loudon is a former director of Midland Bank and chairman and chief executive
of its investment banking subsidiary, Midland Montagu. Previously he spent
12 years with AMRO, the largest Dutch bank.
Sir Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher's former foreign policy adviser, is a
non-executive director of the Jardine Matheson group of companies, of
NatWest - and chairman of its international advisory board - and of Tiphook,
the container group.
At the same time, Gordon Bond, chief operating officer of the highly
successful US operations, has been appointed chief executive of the printing
and writing paper operations in Europe.
This involves responsibility for the European carbonless papers, fine papers
and coated papers divisions. He will also be in charge of Ceasa, the group's
pulp mill in Spain.
Bond is being replaced in the US by Dale Schumaker, currently chief
operating officer of Appleton Papers.
Meanwhile, Ian Kennedy, formerly an executive director at AWA and a
non-executive since July 1992, has resigned, having reached normal
retirement age.

FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI report proves painful reading for Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLUE ARROW affair had a happy ending for National Westminster Bank
yesterday with the publication of a 356-page Department of Trade and
Industry report clearing the bank of allegations that it had behaved
dishonestly.
However, the final chapter in the affair, which has involved two criminal
trials and two DTI reports, is less pleasant for the Bank of England.
The report clears the Bank of allegations that it colluded with NatWest to
prevent the first DTI investigation in 1989.
The three inspectors, Mr Michael Crystal, Mr David Spence and Mr Victor
Temple, are also careful not to make any direct criticism of the Bank.
But their report gives a rare glimpse of the workings of the Bank's
supervisory department, which is responsible for ensuring that banks are
sound and honest.
The picture will not be wholly welcome to the Bank, since it shows the
supervisors as not very aggressive in investigating alleged wrongdoing at a
leading bank, reinforcing the widespread criticisms of the Bank's
supervision of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
In addition, quotations from Bank officials give weight to a second widely
held concern about its role as a supervisor - that officials are somewhat
removed from the real world.
The inspectors asked Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, about his
feelings in February 1988 on learning that the DTI was considering an
investigation into NatWest's role in the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights
issue, which had taken place the previous autumn.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said: 'I rather hoped we might avoid it, with all due
respect to you, because I was very concerned about this in that here we had
the National Westminster Bank, at the pinnacle of the financial
establishment, possibly in difficulties, and I would have liked the matter
to have been cleared up as quickly as possible. I knew from past experience
that some of these inspections can take a long time.'
An unusual insight into banking supervisory policy is also given by Mr Brian
Quinn, the Bank director in charge of supervision.
He said: 'We have - and I think I must say this - a preference for avoiding
official investigations into banks. Banks are essentially about confidence,
and the mere knowledge that there might be an investigation conducted on an
official basis into a bank can have an effect on confidence that we think is
damaging.'
As a result, the Bank encouraged NatWest to carry out an internal
investigation into its role in the Blue Arrow issue. The DTI delayed
launching its own inquiry until the conclusion of this internal probe,
carried out by Sir Philip Wilkinson, NatWest's deputy chairman.
The most interesting part of the report relates to the Bank's involvement in
events leading to the resignations from the NatWest board of three senior
directors - Mr Charles Green, Mr Terry Green and Mr John Plastow - together
with the resignation of Sir Philip from the Bank's Board of Banking
Supervision, which oversees Mr Quinn's supervision department.
Sir Philip's internal report was viewed in both the 1989 DTI report and the
latest one as far too kind to NatWest.
He is criticised for failing to take sufficient legal advice on NatWest's
actions and for failing to pass on to the DTI the serious concerns of
NatWest's inspectors, who had carried out much of the internal investigation
on his behalf.
The Bank was disappointed with Sir Philip and considered declaring that he
was 'not fit and proper for his position as director and chairman of NWIB
(the holding company of NatWest's investment banking activities)'.
That quotation is from a draft letter of July 1989 which was to give notice
to NWIB that its activities were to be restricted under Section 12 of the
1987 Banking Act. But it was never sent.
The inspectors' report shows how Lord Boardman, then NatWest's chairman,
conducted a successful rearguard action to prevent the Bank forcing Sir
Philip's resignation from NatWest. The report says the Bank had the legal
right to demand Sir Philip's resignation from his NatWest posts.
Although Mr Charles Green, Mr Terry Green and Mr Plastow did resign their
posts in July 1989 after criticism of them in the original DTI inspectors'
report, Lord Boardman succeeded in getting the Bank's assurance that it
would not force them to resign - their departure was a matter for NatWest's
board.
There is a fascinating passage in the latest report showing the immense
political pressure upon the governor. In a note written in July 1989, he
writes of the 'chancellor's desire for blood (at NatWest)'.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton explained this note to the inspectors: 'I took the view
that (the chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson) expected us to require the
resignation of senior people or persons, both from the board of (NatWest) or
(County, its investment bank) and also from the Board of Banking
Supervision.
'At some stage he had said to me he thought it unsuitable in the
circumstances for Sir Philip Wilkinson to go on as a member of the Board of
Banking Supervision.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Drivers cool on rail-bus switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT hopes that traffic congestion and environmental concerns might
encourage car users, particularly commuters, to switch to public transport
received a setback from a survey published yesterday.
The annual Lex Report on Motoring says that even if rail privatisation
achieves its objective of higher service standards, it will have little
effect on car use and driving habits.
The survey covering last year of more than 2,000 drivers found that a swing
towards public transport in the late 1980s has been thrown into reverse. In
the survey, only 35 per cent of respondents said they would use their cars
less if public transport were better. London was an exception where 49 per
cent said they would use public transport more.
But company car drivers were less enthusiastic, with only 25 per cent
prepared to consider switching. One in eight drivers said they would be more
likely to use rail after privatisation.
The survey highlights some of the effects of the recession on car ownership
and maintenance. It helps to explain last year's steep slide in new car
sales to non-business buyers and dealers' service business.
Eighteen per cent said they had delayed purchasing a car, up from 16 per
cent the previous year. Private buyers last year had kept their cars on
average 4.4 years, up from 4.1 in the previous survey.
About 13 per cent said they serviced their cars less frequently - that was
partly offset by the 5 per cent who serviced their cars more frequently to
keep them longer. Nearly 15 per cent sought cheaper ways of servicing.

FT  15 JAN 93 / People: Having 'a go at the Acas job'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hougham believes it is the improved industrial relations at Ford of
Britain, where he has been head of personnel for the past eight years, that
has won him what is probably the top job in British industrial relations -
chairman of Acas, the government conciliation service. The job was publicly
advertised for the first time and attracted a strong field - including
Brenda Dean, the former print union boss, and Mike Bett, deputy chairman of
BT.
Since there have been fewer big industrial disputes in recent years, the
organisation has had a lower profile; and its association with the
corporatism of the 1970s has even placed a question mark over its future.
But the appointment of a personnel heavyweight like Hougham, who replaces
Sir Douglas Smith, the current chairman, on February 19, suggests that
Acas's work, especially in the growth area of individual conciliation
between employers and employees, continues to be valued. Thanks to the work
of Acas only one-third of 1991's 60,000 individual conciliation cases ended
up at industrial tribunals.
To some people, Hougham was a surprise choice but he comes with praise from
both sides of industry. According to Jimmy Airlie, the main car industry
official for the AEEU craft union, he is 'tough but shrewd'.
Following record losses, Ford is currently in the middle of a big job
shedding programme, but Hougham, 55, who is formally retiring from the
company, leaving it 30 years to the day after joining it as a graduate
trainee in 1963, insists that he is not running away. 'In some ways I regret
going now but I think we are on course to come out of this difficult period
 -and who in the personnel world would not want a go at the Acas job?' he
says.
But he is reluctant to describe any new plans he might have for Acas - 'that
would be arrogant'.
From the perspective of a junior personnel official at Dagenham in the early
1970s he would not have recognised the current calm in British industrial
relations. 'The changes are not wholly or even mostly to do with changes in
the law, the biggest change is the realisation of the need to compete,' he
says. The biggest change he is likely to have to deal with at Acas will be
an increased workload from the public sector.
He will be paid just over Pounds 60,000, down from the Pounds 80,000-plus
earned by Sir Douglas, and less than his undisclosed current salary. 'I'm
not doing this to become a wealthy man,' he says.
Replacing him as head of personnel at Ford is Bob Hill.

FT  15 JAN 93 / IoD warns Lamont over risks of increasing taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX increases must not form part of the Budget if the fragile economic
recovery is to be given a chance, the Institute of Directors said yesterday.
The IoD warned in its Budget representations to the chancellor that many
powerful negative forces could yet upset the recent improvement in business
confidence.
It also called for a radical restructuring of public spending to overcome
what it believes are structural rather than cyclical shortcomings of public
finances. Even at the peak of the economic cycle, it argued, the government
would not be able to balance the budget.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, said: 'The size of the deficit
problem is so big that no tax increases of acceptable proportions could come
near to resolving it. What is needed is a revolutionary approach to public
spending.'
The institute's recommendations for reducing government spending include
means-testing for all state benefits, tax incentives to encourage people to
make their own provision for services such as education and health, and an
extension of privatisation.
Other proposals include:
Sharply reducing the rate of capital gains tax.
Cutting the rate of inheritance tax by half.
Freezing business rates.
Increasing tax relief for trading and capital losses and raising value added
tax relief on bad debts.
Cutting corporation tax from 33 per cent to 32 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Top price at Maxwell's auction is pounds 60,900
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top price at an auction of the contents of Robert Maxwell's home in Oxford
was the Pounds 60,900 paid for a view of Jerusalem (above) by the Israeli
artist Reuven Rubin, Antony Thorncroft writes.
Possessions from Headington Hill Hall including reproduction Georgian
furniture and video recorders went under the hammer at Sotheby's in London.
The sale, arranged by receivers acting for creditors of the late media
magnate, totalled Pounds 506,038, comfortably above Sotheby's Pounds 300,000
estimate. It was a subdued affair, perhaps because it was the first in
London where the premium paid by buyers on top of the hammer price was 15
per cent, instead of 10 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Car production rises by 4.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR production rose by 4.4 per cent last year, helped by a substantial
increase in output by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, and by Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of General Motors of the US.
Production rose to 1,291,231 from 1,236,900 in 1991, figures released
yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show.
Output of commercial vehicles rose by 14.4 per cent last year to 248,435
from 217,141 in 1991, although output during last month alone was 10.2 per
cent lower than in December 1991 at 16,758.
Last month car production was 19.8 per cent higher than a year before, at
94,652, helped by a 26.6 per cent increase in output for export markets.
Car production has performed relatively well during the recession, with much
higher production for export markets largely making up for lower output for
the home market.
Production fell by only 4.8 per cent from the peak of 1.3m in 1989 to 1.24m
in 1991, in spite of a 30.9 per cent fall in UK new car sales in the same
period.
Car production is set to rise significantly throughout the 1990s largely as
a result of the three car plants under development by Nissan, Toyota and
Honda.
Nissan's Sunderland plant, which began small-volume output in 1986, is
expected to increase production this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year.
The plant is developing a capacity to produce 300,000 cars a year.
Honda began production in October at its Pounds 300m Swindon plant and
Toyota started output last month at its Pounds 700m car plant at Burnaston,
near Derby.
According to the latest forecast by the SMMT, car production will rise to
1.4m this year and will increase further to 1.5m in 1994. Car production
reached its previous peak in 1972 at 1.92m, but then declined rapidly in the
following decade to reach a low point of only 888,000 in 1982.
According to the latest forecast by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive
analysts, car output could exceed the earlier peak by 1997, rising to 2m.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Consumers cautious on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BREAKDOWN of bank lending to UK residents in the three months to the end
of November shows that the rise in loans to individuals was the smallest
since the figures were first compiled in 1987.
Lending to individuals rose by just 0.6 per cent, or Pounds 0.9bn,
reflecting the continuing reluctance of consumers to take on debt. Lending
in the quarter to end-August rose Pounds 3bn.
Bank of England figures show that industry and commerce increased sterling
lending by Pounds 1.3bn in the three months to the end of November compared
with a fall of Pounds 1.7bn in the previous three months. Within that,
lending to hotels and garages jumped to Pounds 0.6bn from a fall of of
Pounds 1bn in the previous quarter.
Lending to companies in the hotel and catering business was the highest
since the beginning of 1991.
Wholesale distribution recorded the strongest increase since 1987.

FT  15 JAN 93 / AEEU recruiting at Nissan suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU engineering and electrical union has launched a campaign to recruit
members among suppliers to Nissan in north-east England.
The AEEU is the only recognised union at Nissan's Sunderland car plant and
its growth in membership there - to about 2,000 out of 4,600 employees has
helped to maintain its Tyneside numbers against a declining national trend.
The union hopes that by recruiting members at Nissan suppliers it will
strengthen its request for recognition by managements, many of which
rebuffed formal AEEU approaches when they first moved into the area and have
no recognised union on site.
'We have the key - Nissan. We're looking for a knock-on effect,' Mr Davey
Hall, AEEU Tyne district secretary, said. 'It's a continuous campaign. We'll
be on the doorsteps on a number of occasions during 1993.'
AEEU full-time officials are handing out recruitment literature outside
suppliers' premises in the early morning and evening. Mr Hall described the
response from employees as 'tremendous' but admitted that take-up had been
limited. On two occasions AEEU officials have been asked to leave company
car parks.
At Nissan's Sunderland plant the works council, not the union, negotiates
pay and conditions, although some elected representatives are AEEU members.
The plant's 195 European suppliers include 27 in north-east England. The
AEEU is focusing on the 21 that have set up since Nissan arrived in the mid
80s.
One crucial AEEU target - TRW, which supplies Nissan with valves, switches
and machined forgings - said the subject was 'very sensitive'.
Mr Nigel Clark, human resources manager of Reydel, which employs 160 people
at its plant in Washington, Tyne and Wear, making door finishers and centre
console assemblies for Nissan, said, 'We aren't anti-union but we're quite
happy with our current arrangements.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Co-chairman of Geneva conference on
Bosnia fly to Zagreb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CYRUS VANCE and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on
Bosnia, are due to fly to Zagreb today for talks with President Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia on the
mediators' proposed peace settlement, Robert Mauthner writes.
Their meeting follows the surprise change of heart by Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at the Geneva talks earlier this week. He
then accepted the Vance-Owen constitutional plan for Bosnia after first
rejecting it.
However, Mr Karadzic's endorsement of the proposals was conditional on their
approval by the Bosnian Serb Assembly within seven days. The parliament is
due to discuss the plan at the end of next week.
Meanwhile, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, said yesterday
that there would be no end to the bloodshed in Bosnia until all heavy
weapons were firmly under international control.
Mr Silajdzic, who was on a private visit to London during which he has had
talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the monitoring of
heavy weapons, as proposed by the international mediators in the Geneva
peace talks, was not enough.

and if necessary evacuate - UK soldiers in Bosnia-Hercegovina were announced
by the government yesterday amid stiff warnings from Tory MPs that Britain
must not be drawn further into the conflict.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the aircraft carrier Ark Royal -
which left Portsmouth yesterday on its way to the Adriatic - would be
accompanied by two frigates and three support ships, carrying a total of
about 2,500 personnel.
They include Royal Artillery units with six 105mm guns and radars for
locating hostile artillery and mortars,
But Mr Rifkind emphasised that Britain's role of escorting humanitarian aid
supplies would not change. The troops would not be used to intervene in
fighting between rival factions in former Yugoslavia.
With many Tory MPs and ministers jittery about further UK casualties in
Bosnia, Mr Rifkind emphasised that the forces' task was to 'enhance the
safety of our troops'.
He added: 'They will also be available to cover a withdrawal of British
forces if that should become necessary. We are determined not to be in a
position where we are unable to respond immediately to a significant
deterioration in the situation.'
Of more than 400 extra army troops, most will initially remain at sea ready
to disembark. Only 89 extra personnel would join the 2,500 British UN
soldiers already in Bosnia.
Plans are also in hand for further possible reinforcements, including
heavier artillery, as well as the dispatch of Jaguar ground-attack aircraft
and Tornado F3 fighters to Italy. Mr Rifkind did not rule out sending
further aircraft in addition to the eight Sea Harriers and 17 Sea King
helicopters with the Ark Royal task force.
But he said no decision had been taken on UK participation in moves to
enforce the no-fly zone in Bosnia.
The reinforcements follow about 25 serious outbreaks of violence in the past
week in the area where British troops are operating. They include the death
on Wednesday of a lance corporal, the first fatality among UK forces there.
Earlier Mr John Major told MPs that Bosnia presented 'special difficulties'
and was 'quite different' from Iraq.
Mr Peter Viggers, Conservative MP for Gosport, warned that 'if the cabinet
commits further troops for use in Bosnia, it will not have the support of
many people on this side of the House'.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'There is a feeling that we
could be drifting inevitably to a war which could last for many years, and
there doesn't seem to be a clear political objective.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions hail concessions on
employment legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADES Union Congress officials and Labour MPs have hailed government
concessions in the legislation on union reform as greater than the
amendments made to all previous employment bills over the past 10 years.
In particular, they are relieved at ministers' agreement to bring forward
changes to the plans to make unions provide all their members with an annual
statement of financial information. Instead, the statement will have to be
printed in the union journal with the proviso that any member can have one
on request. Labour believes that that might save unions nearly Pounds 15m
each year in postal charges.
The detailed discussion of the bill by a cross-party committee of MPs
yielded a further concession yesterday when the government said it would
look at introducing greater flexibility into when a pregnant worker could
begin her maternity leave. At present the bill allows employers to define
when maternity leave starts.
Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said: 'The changes we have won
have been small but they are greater than all concessions in previous
employment bills put together.'
Other changes, won with the assistance of Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment
secretary, include dropping the requirement for unions to offer equal
assistance to all the candidates in executive elections. Union officials
said that would effectively mean banning incumbent candidates from standing.
The government has also conceded an exemption from the requirement for
independent scrutiny of industrial action ballots involving only small
numbers of workers.
In spite of lobbying from unions and from employers, however, the government
has refused to make any substantial concession on its plans for changing the
'check off' arrangements through which union dues are deducted automatically
from pay. The bill would mean an employee would have to indicate approval
every three years.
Labour and the unions still hope that the move, which may cut union
membership by more than 20 per cent, can be blocked when the bill goes to
the House of Lords.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, infuriated ministers and Tory backbenchers
in the Commons yesterday by persistently challenging the use of nearly
Pounds 5,000 of taxpayers' money to defray part of the legal expenses
incurred by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in evicting a tenant from his
private home.
The Labour leader was accused of indulging in 'innuendo' by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, who insisted that a report by Sir John Bourn, the
Comptroller and Auditor General, showed that 'no impropriety occurred'.
To Labour cheers, Mr Smith retorted that it was not a matter of innuendo but
of public policy. The issue, he maintained, was whether taxpayers' money
should finance the legal affairs of a minister in his private capacity.
Labour backbenchers heckled and jeered Mr Major when he protested that that
Mr Smith had been 'uncharacteristically cheap' in choosing to pursue Mr
Lamont.
An unrepentant Mr Smith claimed that an attempt had been made to hide from
the public the expenditure undertaken on behalf of the chancellor and to
prevent it being scrutinised by MPs.
Calling on the prime minister to recognise the distinction between public
duty and private concern, he said it was clear that the chancellor had
instructed solicitors without referring to any of the government's legal
advisers.
The prime minister emphasised that the report by Sir John Bourn had fully
exonerated the Treasury on the central questions namely 'was it right to
make the payment, and were any rules breached'.
Mr Major said the report confirmed that the chancellor did not ask for
assistance and made no criticism of his actions.
The prime minister told Mr Smith that if he had 'a shred of self-respect' he
would withdraw his remarks.
Mr Smith refused to do so, and later made known that he intended to return
to the issue in a speech criticising the standards of ministerial conduct
and complaining of the 'cosy relationship' which some have established with
top civil servants.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke determined to act on press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE almost insuperable political difficulties for any government in taking a
firm stance on press regulation were tacitly underlined yesterday by Mr
Peter Brooke's Commons statement on Sir David Calcutt QC's report.
The national heritage secretary's gratitude for the review of what he
described as an 'exceptionally difficult and controversial subject' may have
been heartfelt. But, while legal steps safeguarding personal privacy will be
taken, his claim that the review has 'significantly' moved forward the
public debate on press self-regulation is less credible.
The Calcutt report proposed not self-regulation, but statutory controls
enshrined in law. By rejecting that, the government is back at the drawing
board.
Mr Brooke's statement signalled that the government will act on the report's
proposals for new criminal legislation to cope with trespass, electronic
bugging and photographic invasions of privacy. He agreed to take up, among
other things, a proposal to examine a civil remedy - the law of tort - to
protect victims of undue intrusion.
The government risks opening a legal Pandora's box by examining how the Data
Protection Act might contain provisions relevant to the debate - a move that
raises the question of the public's right to scrutinise newspaper files.
Mitigating provisions to protect legitimate press scrutiny on the grounds of
public interest or informing the public about an individual's discharge of
his public functions were also accepted.
In his statement, Mr Brooke broadly endorsed Sir David's caustic views of
the Press Complaints Commission. Commending the report's conclusions as
'compelling', he said that the PCC was not an 'effective regulator' or truly
independent.
On Sir David's central proposal - the creation of a tribunal with legal
powers to punish breaches of a code of conduct - Mr Brooke was unable to
agree.
Citing the constitutional significance of such a change and arguing that it
would depart from the country's traditional approach to press regulation, he
declared: 'The government would be extremely reluctant to pursue that
route.'
Instead, the government has promised to outline its conclusions more fully
on January 29 when Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP for Hammersmith, presents
his bill to create a right-of-reply law. Final decisions will also await the
findings of the Commons national heritage committee and views of the press
on the Calcutt report.
Responding to questions, Mr Brooke indicated sympathy for suggestions that
the PCC should be strengthened by the introduction of independent members
and for additional powers to impose fines on publications that breached the
standards it laid down.
There was support from some Conservative backbenchers for a suggestion by Mr
Joe Ashton (Lab Bassetlaw) that those who suffered at the hands of the press
should be able to resort to a legal body with a similar status to industrial
tribunals.
Mr Brooke said a central consideration for the government must be how the
private individual could receive efficient and financial redress. Officials
added later that the question of the availability of legal aid was one of
the central issues to be resolved when the question of creating a civil tort
on privacy is examined.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cry of 'censorship' against
proposed spike
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association, which
represents national newspapers, said a number of leading publishers would
not oppose action being taken against telephone tapping and other forms of
physical intrusion, Raymond Snoddy writes.
But Sir Frank, who is deputy chairman of The Daily Telegraph, warned: 'The
government would be extremely unwise to frame an act of parliament
specifically directed against journalists.'
Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said: 'If the government were to
implement all of this it would be the most draconian censorship rules faced
in peacetime ever.' He said the measures would 'enormously increase
injunctive power', but did not oppose the law being brought up to date on
electronic surveillance, as long as there was a public-interest defence.
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian and a member of the Press
Complaints Commission, accused Sir David of having a closed mind and being
'a terribly biased witness' because proposals he made after his 1990 inquiry
had not been implemented.
The Newspaper Society, which represents regional and local newspapers, said
the government should have rejected outright Sir David's 'authoritarian
measures'. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the Newspaper Society, said:
'Freedom of expression in Britain remains under threat.'
Earlier in the day, before publication of the Calcutt report, Mr Andreas
Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, told the national heritage
committee that the media had 'unduly and wrongly' invaded people's privacy.
He backed new laws against trespass, electronic eavesdropping and 'peeping
Tom pictures'.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reforms would curb 'wildest
excesses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR David Calcutt QC recommended yesterday that a wide range of measures
should be taken against the press to protect individual privacy, including
the setting up of a statutory tribunal with the power to restrain
publication and to fine newspapers up to 1 per cent of annual revenue.
In his much-leaked report, Review of Self-Regulation, published yesterday
after a six-month study, Sir David concluded that press self-regulation
under the Press Complaints Commission had not worked.
He called for the creation of new criminal offences against physical
intrusion, such as using surveillance devices, with fines of up to Pounds
5,000.
He also recommended that the government consider introducing a new tort
(civil wrong) of infringement of privacy. It could not be restricted to the
press - it would have to include all the media and cover a wide range of
human and technological activities.
Sir David, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, also called on the
government to consider:
Whether the Data Protection Act's provisions are relevant for tackling
misrepresentation of intrusion into personal privacy by the press.
Whether further legislation on interception of telephone calls is needed.
Whether legislation preventing the identification of minors involved in
court cases should be amended to remove inconsistencies.
Sir David said his recommendations were designed to make a positive
contribution to the development of the highest standards of journalism 'to
enable the press to operate freely and responsibly and to give it the
backing needed in a fiercely competitive market, to resist the wildest
excesses'.
They were not designed to suppress free speech or stultify a vibrant and
dynamic press.
'They are designed principally to ensure that privacy, which all agree
should be respected, is protected from unjustifiable intrusion, and
protected by a body in which the public, as well as the press, has
confidence.'
Many of the proposals closely follow the regime Sir David recommended in
1990 should be imposed if 'the last chance' for self-regulation were to
fail.
That was when his committee published its report on 'privacy and related
matters'. His verdict on the performance of Lord McGregor's PCC  - which
replaced the Press Council under the Calcutt Committee recommendations - is
unambiguous. He said the PCC had not turned out to be an effective regulator
of the press - it was largely a creature of the newspaper industry, its
members had not been independently appointed, the code of practice had been
watered down, and no 'hotline' had been set up for those who feared their
privacy was about to be invaded.
'The commission has not been set up in a way, and is not operating a code of
practice, which enables it to command not only press but also public
confidence,' Sir David said. He said the PCC was not holding the balance
fairly between the press and the individual.
He was also concerned about the PCC's handling of the serialisation of Mr
Andrew Morton's book on Princess Diana and of reporting of stories
concerning Mr David Mellor, the former National Heritage secretary, and the
actress Ms Antonia de Sancha 'and the commission's apparent lack of public
action in other cases involving public figures where some action might
reasonably have been expected'.
Sir David said that nothing he had learned about the press led him to
believe it would make the changes needed, and the answer was a statutory
tribunal chaired by a judge or senior lawyer.
The report does not give extensive evidence, other than criticism of the way
the PCC was set up, to justify the view that self-regulation had failed and
could never be made to work.
'The review received evidence from several private individuals who were
unhappy with the way they had been treated by the press,' Sir David said.
Claims included inaccurate reporting, harassment, the taking and publication
of unauthorised photographs and the invasion of privacy of hospital patients
or grieving relatives.
Sir David's main remedy, a statutory press complaints tribunal, could not
only 'restrain publication of material in breach of the code of practice' by
means of injunctions and impose fines.
The new offences of physical intrusion - entering private property without
consent, using surveillance devices without consent, and taking photographs
or recordings without consent on private property - would be summary
offences not carrying a prison sentence.
Sir David proposed that the High Court be able to grant injunctions
preventing publication of material obtained by any of the proposed offences.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heavies lead a virulent campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S publication of the Calcutt report was preceded by a virulent
press campaign against its recommendations.
Like veteran field commanders, the broadsheets have led the charge, followed
by some rather indisciplined troops - the tabloids, which have smelt blood
and moved in for the kill. The papers have brought out their big guns in the
days leading up to publication.
The opening volley of the new year was fired on January 4 by The
Independent, identifying in general terms Calcutt's plans for a tough
statutory body as a potential attack on democracy.
More extensive leaks were published on January 10 by the Sunday broadsheets,
led by The Sunday Times with the headline 'Britain's toughest-ever curbs on
freedom of the press'.
They were backed up by hard-hitting coverage in the tabloids. Condemning
'the black hole of Calcutt', the News of the World denounced an
'establishment plot' to install the 'the news of the government'. It pledged
to fight Calcutt 'every column inch of the way', and cheekily made its lead
story an alleged bribery scandal involving a civil servant.
On Monday, as national newspaper editors issued virulent anti-Calcutt
statements, The Sun under the headline 'Hands off Your Sun' urged its
readers: 'Don't be fooled. This argument is not about protecting the little
man from the big bad press. It's about stopping us from printing the truth
about pompous public figures.'
Its rival the Daily Mirror, clearly anxious to establish respectable
post-Maxwell credentials, admitted that newspapers were not perfect and that
journalists 'make mistakes'. But it argued that existing laws of libel and
the Press Complaints Committee were sufficient.
By then, some ministers were reported to be siding with some of Calcutt's
proposals - those on bugging and eavesdropping, which are an essential part
of the tabloid armoury, although not necessarily of all the broadsheets. The
Guardian defensively stated that the press faced a big obstacle 'for it
currently has fewfriends'.
It soon found a friend - its Westminster correspondent David Hencke was
handed a strategic missile: a leaked letter to Sir David Calcutt from Lord
McGregor, chairman of the PCC, stating that at least one member of the royal
family had manipulated the press in reporting the marriage difficulties of
the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Broadsheets and tabloids hit back, arguing that the letter had undermined
the case of those who used alleged media mistreatment of the royal family as
grounds for sweeping curbs on the press.
But, as The Guardian noted in its editorial earlier in the week, 'the
greatest trouble is that the general public's view of what's awful switches
inevitably from moment to moment.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Halt urged to debate on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS pressure at Westminster last night for progress on the bill
implementing the Maastricht treaty to be suspended in the wake of the
resignation of Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister.
As detailed consideration of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill
neared the end of its fourth day, Conservative Euro-sceptics demanded
clarification of any consequences for the proposed second Danish referendum.
Mr Tony Marlow, Conservative MP for Northampton North, said it was 'futile
and fatuous' for debate on the measure to continue.
But Downing Street said it saw no reason to suppose that Mr Schluter's
departure would affect Danish referendum plans - even if it led to a general
election.
For Labour, Mr George Robertson, a frontbench spokesman, said that only the
Danish prime minister had resigned. As Labour knew to its cost from events
succeeding Baroness Thatcher's exit, 'that does not automatically mean a
general election.'
Mr Schluter's resignation further encouraged the Euro-sceptic camp, which
had sought to build on its success in framing new provisions for insertion
into the ratification bill which would require a referendum to be held
before the treaty is given legal effect.
Euro-sceptics were later brought back down to earth, however, when a batch
of amendments on general Maastricht issues was defeated by 304 votes to 74,
a government majority of 230.
Labour signalled its unwillingness to let the government dictate the pace of
the debate by opposing the motion to end discussion of this group of
amendments. The motion was nonetheless carried by 298 votes to 240.
Mr John Major has assured MPs that the third reading of the ratification
bill at Westminster will not take place until after a second referendum is
held.
As a newspaper opinion poll showed that a big majority of British voters
wanted a Maastricht referendum, Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East,
called for the new provisions to be debated much earlier in the committee
stage than is intended.
Sir Teddy said there seemed to be 'a widespread feeling' among MPs that if
such a step were agreed consideration of the bill could be completed very
quickly.
Three days have been set aside next week for continuation of the committee
stage but as much as a further 20 days would be needed for the completion of
the stage, which would drag it out until early summer.
A Gallup opinion poll for today's Daily Telegraph indicated that while 71
per cent of voters wanted a referendum, turnout in any such vote would be
low.

be facilitated if those calling for a referendum withdrew the large number
of other amendments.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Tanker oil dispersal a 'minor miracle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID dispersal of the 84,500 tonnes of oil from the wrecked Braer has
been 'a minor miracle', the Shetland Islands council said yesterday.
Maps drawn up daily at the council's emergency centre at Sumburgh Head, the
southern tip of the islands where the tanker hit the rocks, show that the
slick has shrunk sharply since the weekend.
Most of the original patches of thick black oil have broken up under the
impact of ferocious weather into thin sheens and patches of 'grey lines'.
Oil is still visible on a handful of beaches, the area around the tanker
including Quendale Bay; the Bay of Scousburgh; St Ninian's Bay; and Bigton
Wick. But dispersal has been much faster than in many other oil spills
because the Braer's cargo was relatively light Norwegian crude oil.
Scientists in the Shetlands are becoming more confident that much of the
Braer's heavier 'bunker' or fuel oil has also dispersed. The council said
yesterday: 'It is some days since bunker oil appeared on the maps except in
the immediate vicinity of the wreck - although it is not impossible that
some may still be on board'.
The massive pounding by the waves has broken the oil into ever smaller
droplets, enabling it to sink into the water, when bacteria then break it
down. To monitor exactly how far the particles are spreading scientists from
the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries department have been on board
the research vessel Clupea since January 11. They will take samples of sand,
water, shellfish and plankton for another week.
Mr Barry Lester, of the Department of Transport's marine pollution control
unit, which is in charge of the Shetland clean-up, said yesterday: 'It is
too early for scientists to give conclusions, but it seems highly unlikely
that much oil has settled on the sea bed.'
Although the rapid clearing of the oil confounds some early predictions of
ecological disaster, fishermen and environmentalists are still scanning the
seas for signs of longer-term effects.
A week ago the Scottish Office banned fishing or harvesting of salmon in a
400,000 sq mile area around the spill. The 16 salmon farms in the zone
account for about a quarter of Shetland's salmon farming, which last year
was 10,500 tonnes and was worth Pounds 33m.
Mr Scott Findlay, of the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association, said: 'The
way it looks now, only farms within the closure zone are affected by the
sheen, and rigorous scientific testing is now under way to see the effect on
the fish.'
He added: 'There have been no salmon mortalities whatsoever, and there is no
chance tainted fish will ever enter the food chain.'
Environmentalists sound distinctly more optimistic than they did last week.
Mr David Mitchell, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which
has counted 750 dead birds so far, said: 'It is unlikely that there will be
many more bird oilings.'
Dispersal of the oil has removed much of the risk to migratory birds, which
will start flying in to breed within two months.
He warned, however, that the black guillemot, which has already arrived on
the islands, has been badly hurt by the slick. 'There will be recolonisation
but it will be slow - this bird lays only one egg a year.'
The RSPB is also afraid that mussel beds have been wiped out, causing eider
ducks to move out of the region.

FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI reluctant to split nuclear levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is playing down the idea of diverting
part of the nuclear levy paid on electricity bills to other purposes such as
subsidising cleaner coal technology.
Such a switch is believed to be among the measures under consideration by
MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee, which will announce
proposals to boost the coal sector later this month.
In a confidential memo to the committee, the DTI says: 'It would not be
possible under the Electricity Act 1989 to divert the levy to other purposes
such as the funding of the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to existing
coal-fired stations.
'However . . . the coal review is considering methods and costs of reducing
the price of British coal by providing support to the coal industry, for
example by subsidy or levy arrangements.'
In the six months to last September, Nuclear Electric - the state-owned
nuclear power generator - received income of Pounds 632m from the levy to
help it finance the heavy decommissioning costs of its nuclear plant.
That helped it to report a half-yearly operating profit of Pounds 255m.
Ministers have also cast doubt on the practicality of abandoning
arrangements enabling France to supply up to 6 per cent of the electricity
that is sold in England and Wales.
That has been suggested by some observers as another possible means of
helping the domestic coal industry.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Court is told of BP corruption at very high level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-LEVEL corruption within British Petroleum led to the oil company
becoming the victim of extensive fraud over its North Sea investment
programme, a London court heard yesterday.
Confidential details of tenders submitted for pipes and pumping equipment
contracts worth up to Pounds 50m were leaked by BP employees to middlemen
who passed the information on to European and Japanese companies competing
for the business, Southwark Crown Court was told.
The information allowed companies to undercut rivals or increase the final
price charged to BP. Companies such as Thyssen, Sulzer Pumps UK and Borsig
as well as Japanese engineering groups were among the beneficiaries of the
fraud, Mr Stephen Batten QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said.
On trial are two of the alleged 'middlemen', Mr Josef Szrajber of Mayfair,
London, and Mr Paolo Sorelli of Paddington, London. Both deny seven charges
of conspiracy to defraud BP by using confidential information relating to
contract tenders between 1988 and 1990.
The alleged corruption involved three elements, Mr Batten said. They were BP
staff prepared to leak information, the middlemen or 'pedlars' who passed it
on and the companies willing to pay for it.
The corruption within BP's procurement department went to a very high level,
he said. 'Not perhaps to the very top, but certainly the sort of level which
must have had good inside information,' he added.
One BP employee - referred to as Mr X - was a particularly important source
of information. Documents showed the 'commissions' - usually 2 per cent or 3
per cent of the contract value - were often split three ways between Mr X,
Mr Szrajber and Mr Sorelli. A Thyssen employee, Mr Manfred Reuss, also took
a cut in commissions when his company won a contract, Mr Batten said.
Mr Sorelli had access to BP personnel and Mr Szrajber dealt with the
companies prepared to pay for information.
Records kept by Mr Szrajber, which were seized after his offices were
searched in the summer of 1990, gave considerable detail of the corrupt
deals and were likely to prove his undoing, Mr Batten said.
A document Mr Sorelli sent Mr Szrajber explained how Mr X would receive half
of a 4 per cent commission needed to pay other people in BP's procurement
division.
The trial continues today.

GOVERNMENT regulation of privatised industries will break down because of
the complexity of the businesses, Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of British
Telecommunications, warned yesterday.
'Everything points to the eventual - and some might say imminent - breakdown

Mr Vallance said the inevitable convergence of industries such as

FT  15 JAN 93 / Families in need increase by 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of families receiving income support rose from 2.9m in 1979 to
4.1m in 1989 according to statistics published by the Commons social
security committee yesterday, Alan Pike writes.
By 1989, 6.98m people were living in households dependent on income support,
compared with 4.57m in 1979. The main groups accounting for the growth were
single parents, the unemployed and long-term sick and disabled people. Over
the same period there was a rise of almost 50 per cent in the number of
families with incomes below benefit level - up from 2.05m to 2.97m.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the report
demonstrated that during the 1980s the incomes of those on state benefits
had grown at only half the rate of the population as a whole. He said the
prime minister, 'the self-declared prophet of the classless society', should
read the report with shame.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Insurers urged to counter fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS must do more to tackle widespread fraud, loss adjusters have urged.
The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters says that at least one in four
household claims is inflated fraudulently, and insurance companies should
beef up procedures for investigating claims.
Mr Bev Fitzgerald, of the institute, said: 'Over the past three to four
years there has been a slippage of standards at insurance companies. They
have issued cheques too freely. There is a feeling among the public that
'I'd be daft not to'.'
The concern follows a survey of the institute's 2,500 members, which showed
that the vast majority of adjusters, who independently negotiate claims on
behalf of insurance companies, felt the average householder fraudulently
added at least 25 per cent to a claim.
Eighty-five per cent of the 574 adjusters surveyed said insurance companies
sometimes ignored their suspicions and 35 per cent said their suspicions
were regularly ignored.
Companies were starting to investigate claims on a random basis - after
heavy losses in 1990 and 1991 - but such inquiries should become more
thorough, Mr Fitzgerald said.
Last June the Association of British Insurers said bogus and inflated claims
had cost an estimated Pounds 400m in 1991. A Gallup poll disclosed a
widespread belief that insurance fraud was extensive.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Review of council grants set to begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THOROUGH review of the way in which the government allocates grant to
councils is likely to begin next month with the aim of introducing changes
in the spring of next year.
The commitment to looking again at the calculation of standard spending
assessments will be critical to ministers in winning the Commons debate due
shortly on the local spending settlement for 1993-94.
Both Tory and opposition MPs have repeatedly criticised the SSA system
through which the government decides how much it thinks councils should
spend - and which thus determines how much grant they receive.
Introducing changes to the SSA methodology for 1994-95 would mean that they
coincide with the use of full information from the 1991 census.
Only raw population data from 1991 have been used in determining grant for
the coming year.
Ministers admit privately that, as the system of limiting or 'capping' local
spending becomes increasingly dependent on SSAs, the present system might
not be 'robust' enough to be a fair basis. But they did not want to
complicate the first year of the new council tax, which replaces the poll
tax in April, with a review of another aspect of local-government finance.
Instead, the 90 local authority delegations which have made representations
to environment ministers about SSAs have been told that the only likely area
for change in the coming year is in the account taken of the removal from
councils of responsibility for further education.
The review of SSAs will cover matters such as whether to change the way in
which the grant reflects the number of people from ethnic minorities in a
particular area, and whether the local unemployment level should become a
factor.
In advance of the Commons debate, Labour yesterday renewed its long-standing
attack on the SSA system with a claim that the calculations were 'partisan'.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, highlighted government
figures showing that in England Labour councils received an average increase
of 2.5 per cent in their SSAs, while Conservative councils received an
average rise of 3.3 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 93 / ICI power talks trigger calls for cheaper deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK POWER generators were inundated with inquiries from industrial users
yesterday after news that the Department of Trade and Industry may allow a
special licence for PowerGen to sell electricity cheaply to Imperial
Chemical Industries.
Sharp increases in electricity prices over the past two years have been
criticised by big industrial users and they are eager to share in any
opportunity to cut power costs.
ICI says its power bills have gone up 60 per cent since April 1991. It now
pays Pounds 31 a megawatt-hour compared with the Pounds 25 it believes its
main German competitors are paying.
It is unclear, however, how the government can grant one company - albeit a
very large one - special access to cheaper electricity without making
similar offers across industry.
Power industry sources were warning yesterday that even if it did,
exemptions would drive up costs for everyone else.
It was not clear yesterday what stage the discussions with ICI had actually
reached. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users Council, said he
was told before Christmas by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, that the
separate deal was in the process of being negotiated.
The Office of Electricity Regulation, which would issue the licence, also
confirmed that it was discussing the matter with the DTI.
ICI said it was still talking to both the government and the generating
companies after 18 months and that no agreement had been reached. The
company reiterated that it was deeply concerned about the future of its
chlorine and derivatives business, which needed a rapid cut in electricity
costs if they were to survive against overseas competition.
Industrial concern about power prices dates back three years to when the
electricity industry was privatised. At that time, subsidies for large
electricity users were phased out, leaving large companies with sharp price
increases.
Part of the difficulty lies in the way the UK electricity market works.
The rules governing the newly privatised power industry include a
requirement that power generators sell all their output through the pool,
the wholesale market where prices are set every half hour throughout the
day.
Power sold through the pool, however, collects heavy charges to pay for
running the UK electricity system. They can add from 5 per cent to 10 per
cent to electricity bills.
The solution apparently being considered by the DTI is to allow generators
to sell a certain amount of power outside the pool, directly to large
industrial customers. Those deals would bypass the pool charges.
A further benefit might be that sales outside the pool would escape the
nuclear levy. The levy helps to fund the nuclear power industry's clean-up
costs and adds a further 10 per cent to electricity bills.
Exemption from the pool might reduce the cost of electricity by up to 20 per
cent. That happens to be about the size of the reduction that ICI says it
needs to remain competitive.
Appealing though that arrangement looks to industry, the majority of
electricity users would be losers. The pool's costs would remain the same -
and so would those of the nuclear power industry. The costs would only fall
even more heavily on non-exempted electricity users.
If a special dispensation were given to ICI it would also raise the issue of
which other users should benefit from similar licences.
The DTI said yesterday that it was talking to several companies in the Major
Energy Users Council. One suggestion is that only those using more than
100MW on a single site should benefit, which would cover large operations
such as British Steel, United Engineering Steel and Shotton Paper.
Mr Rost said that if the ICI deal went ahead it would open the gates for
other companies. 'It is unacceptable that one company can get a special
advantage when others are equally hard-pressed,' he said.
He argued that the government should restructure the electricity industry to
create more opportunity for companies to shop around.
Both the large power generators, PowerGen and National Power, emphasised
yesterday that any deals under new licences would be done on strictly
commercial terms. There was no question of price cutting.
PowerGen said it had always expressed sympathy at the plight of intensive
energy users after the removal of subsidies, but it was a matter for the
government if it wanted to offer support for ICI.
There would be other companies that believed their case for support was
every bit as strong as that for ICI, it said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / PIA doubts on tougher rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services, is being urged by some
of its members to reject a regulator's request that it adopt much tougher
rules.
The PIA board had been told by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities
and Investments Board, that it will not be approved as a self-regulatory
body unless it tightens up its rules, particularly those relating to
independent financial advisers.
PIA board members said they had been advised by several representatives of
independent financial advisers to write to Mr Large warning that his
proposals for the investment authority could not be achieved.
The board is to meet again on February 9 to discuss how to respond to Mr
Large. It is expected that board members will ask Mr Large to clarify some
of the points in his letter.
In particular, members will be asking whether the SIB is urging that
building societies, most of which sell the insurance products of a single,
separate company, be encouraged to join the new body.
Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of the PIA board, said yesterday that the letter
from Mr Large had forced the board to extend the timetable for implementing
the new authority.
'The views expressed in the SIB letter will of course be taken into account
by the Personal Investment Authority in the continuing development of its
prospectus,' Sir Gordon said in a statement.
Privately, several board members expressed grave doubts that Fimbra members
would vote to approve a PIA along the lines of that demanded by Mr Large.

Plant - and have included a draft letter for guidance.
They are stepping up their lobbying during a two-week extension, announced
last Thursday, to the public consultation process on proposed new discharge
authorisations.
The union leaders, who also plan to double the 18,000 signatures on their
pro-Thorp petition, are competing against environmental groups' efforts. The
inspectorate has received 15,000 communications, 9,500 of them opposing
Thorp, since consultation began in mid-November. Prior to that, it received
38,000, mostly anti-Thorp.
In 1991-92, British Nuclear Fuels spent Pounds 604m, mainly for its
Sellafield site, with 1,090 British companies. Goods supplied ranged from
vending machine fairy cakes to stainless steel vessels. The controversy over
Thorp's commissioning has alarmed BNFL suppliers nationally; a number have
written to the company and MPs expressing their concern.
The Sellafield unions fear the entire site's future may be jeopardised, with
grave economic consequences for west Cumbria, if Thorp is not commissioned.
'Take one part away and the other falls,' said Mr John Kane, shop stewards
committee secretary.
Without Sellafield, he estimated, male unemployment locally would exceed 40
per cent. The site employs 12,400 on BNFL's and contractors' payrolls.
Suppliers planning to write to HMIP include Romar, the Cleator Moor-based
industrial workwear manufacturer. Two thirds of the company's Pounds 300,000
annual turnover is with Sellafield.
'Sellafield is the insurance policy for West Cumbria', said Romar's founder
Mr John Rowlands. Loss of Thorp would mean a 30 per cent drop in his
business, the loss of three of his 10 employees and cancellation of
expansion plans, he said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US trade officials hold out little hope of
early end to Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US TRADE officials in Geneva yesterday held out little prospect of an early
conclusion to the Uruguay Round but said negotiations would continue in the
hope of progress by next Tuesday's stock-taking meeting of the top-level
Trade Negotiations Committee, writes Frances Williams.
Trade negotiators will try to present the Clinton administration, which
takes office the following day, with as few outstanding problems as
possible, in the dwindling hope that an accord can still be reached before
the current US negotiators' authority expires on March 2.
A senior US negotiator said a number of 'significant sticking points'
remained in talks with the EC on industrial tariffs, and there had been
little progress in resolving vital issues in separate discussions on the
draft package of Uruguay Round rules. There were also still differences with
the EC over agriculture.

FT  15 JAN 93 / US retail spending surges in December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US RETAIL sales rose 1.2 per cent between November and December, confirming
anecdotal reports of a surge in consumer spending at the end of last year,
the Commerce Department reported yesterday. They rose 5.1 per cent during
1992 as a whole, making last year the best for retailers since 1989. The
figures are not adjusted for inflation.
The year-end spurt, however, masked significant differences in the fortunes
of particular sectors. Car sales rose 3.2 per cent but general department
store sales fell 0.7 per cent relative to November. Excluding car
dealerships, retail sales rose by only 0.6 per cent.
Separately, the department reported producer prices up by 0.2 per cent last
month and by only 1.9 per cent in 1992 as a whole - the lowest rate of
wholesale inflation since 1983.
Weekly figures for state unemployment claims jumped 52,000 to 343,000, their
largest increase in five months. However, weekly numbers are volatile and
the new total is consistent with sluggish imp-rovement in labour markets.
Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said yesterday's sales
figures reflected a real increase in consumer spending at an annual rate of
about 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.7 per cent in the
third quarter.
Most analysts, however, forecast a slower pace of consumer spending in the
first half of this year. Spending last year ran well ahead of income and
employment growth, resulting in a fall in the already low personal savings
rate.
President-elect Bill Clinton's advisers have refused to rule out a short-run
economic stimulus in part because of worries about the sustainability of a
consumption-led upturn.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Economic policy pledge: President-elect aims for package in
March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday promised that he would have an
economic policy package ready for inclusion in a 'state of the union'
message by the middle of March at the latest.
Responding to questions after revealing more than 30 new White House
appointments, he noted that in 1981, the last time a president from a
different political party took over, Mr Ronald Reagan had unveiled his
policies by mid-March.
'I think we can do better than that,' he added.
He again denied that he had broken an election campaign promise by dropping
a commitment to cut income taxes for the middle class. He said the press had
exaggerated his determination to cut taxes. 'I never met a voter last year
who thought that was necessary.'
The essential ingredients of his economic plan were threefold, he said:
an investment strategy to stimulate growth and increase wages,
reduction of the federal budget deficit and national debt,
and proposals to attack the crisis in health care.
The new appointments announced by Mr Clinton yesterday did not include
sub-cabinet level positions in the State, Treasury or Defence departments,
all of which are now eagerly awaited.
He recommended that Mr David Wilhelm, a senior campaign manager, take over
as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, from Mr Ron Brown - who
has been chosen to be commerce secretary - with Mr Craig Smith, a long-time
aide, as the committee's political director.
The party will doubtless accede to this request.
As expected, most of the top White House staff posts also went to
long-standing associates and campaign workers.
Among the more prominent, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the able chief
spokesman, becomes director of communications, with Ms Dee Dee Myers
continuing as press secretary.
Mr Clinton highlighted the appointments of Ms Carol Rasco as assistant for
domestic policy, and Mr Eli Segal to be in charge of the new national
service corps. Both have been with the president-elect for years.
The delicate job of liaison with Congress has been entrusted to Mr Howard
Paster, a veteran Washington insider, with Ms Susan Brophy, also well versed
in the ways of the capital, as deputy.
Mr Ira Magaziner, the business consultant who has been a member of Mr
Clinton's economic policy brains trust, is brought into the White House as a
special assistant on domestic issues.
Mr Gene Sperling, the campaign's economic adviser, will help Mr Robert Rubin
run the new economic policy security council.
Deputy chief of staff, under Mr Thomas McLarty, the Arkansas businessman,
will be Mr Mark Gearan, while another Clinton intimate, Mr Bruce Lindsey, in
charge of personnel.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Fresh tax rules for foreign companies win wary backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL tax lawyers and foreign governments have responded with
cautious approval to new rules from the US Internal Revenue Service on the
taxation of earnings by foreign-owned companies.
The new rules, put out on a temporary basis, are expected to be less helpful
to foreign corporations than the current ones, which date from the 1960s,
but still represent a significant retreat from proposals put out by the IRS
last year, and widely denounced by US and foreign multinationals as
unworkable.
The Section 482 transfer pricing regulations control the way companies price
the goods and services they exchange with their overseas subsidiaries. Many
members of congress, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton, have claimed
foreign companies manipulate these intra-company prices to make profits
appear at home, rather than at the level of the US subsidiary.
Most international treaties stipulate these transfer prices should be
determined on an arm's-length basis, as if the parent and the subsidiary
were selling their goods or services to an unrelated company. Regulations
proposed by the IRS last year imposed a 'comparable profits interval' test
as a mandatory check that the foreign-owned subsidiary was reporting similar
profits to its US competitors.
Companies will now be able to choose from a variety of approaches, though
required to produce a considerable volume of documentation to justify their
transfer pricing structure. 'They do represent a more realistic approach to
the tests which one must make,' Mr Carr Ferguson, tax partner with the law
firm of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, said.
'It's a lot more acceptable than the proposed regulations, and much more in
keeping with the arm's-length principle,' a European diplomat. added. 'We
think these regulations are fully consistent with the arm's-length
principle,' said Mr Alan Wilensky, assistant-secretary for tax policy at the
US Treasury.
Some accountants warned the new Section 482 rules would impose a burden on
companies to document from the outset the business decisions behind their
transfer pricing structures, rather than attempting to justify their pricing
retrospectively.
It is unclear what future awaits the new rules, promulgated just a week
before the new Clinton administration takes office, but which do not take
effect until April. 'The incoming administration has been given a 90-day
window to act,' said Mr Steven Hannes, national director of transfer pricing
with the accounting firm of Deloitte and Touche.
But Mr Clinton may be under such pressure to fulfil his campaign promise to
levy an extra Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) a year from foreign companies that
further legislation is likely, and some Washington lawyers believe foreign
governments need to take tough pre-emptive action. 'Clinton made it an
article of faith. The only thing Congress will listen to is pressure from
the grassroots, and retaliation,' Mr Dan Burt, of the law firm of Burt,
Maner and Miller, said.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Hills bows out on buoyant note - Nancy
Dunne on US trade representative's four years in office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUSTOMARY perfection of Mrs Carla Hills' office was disturbed this week
by packing boxes and a chair covered with ribbons. The chair - shipped over
from the White House cabinet room - was a gift from her senior staff and
bears a nameplate: 'US Trade Representative, February 1, 1989'.
Although she and her friend and boss, George Bush, are leaving office, and
the frustrating Uruguay Round talks are still dragging on, Mrs Hills' mood
was buoyant. When her stint finishes, at noon next Wednesday, she will go
home to consider the 'next chapter in my life.'
Of the past four years, she has no regrets. The job was the 'most
exhilarating' she ever had, including her first cabinet post heading the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. She hopes to hand to her
successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, a completed package of Uruguay Round market
access agreements. She wants to say: 'I think you ought to go forward with
this. It is politically supportable here at home.'
But her demeanour suggests that, once again, the European Community is
playing havoc with her best-laid plans. The US, she says, needs 'a big
package' of tariff reductions on products like pharmaceuticals, nonferrous
metals, wood and paper to generate support in the US Congress for the entire
Gatt package.
'If the EC doesn't play,' she says, 'we have a huge segment of trade that is
not covered. They have not been willing to put together a package that has
the maximum effect economically and politically.'
The key to the Uruguay Round may have been disappointingly elusive, but Mrs
Hills finds solace in the knowledge that she has completed 'hundreds' of
market-opening agreements and brought 20 unilateral Section 301 cases
against protectionist markets, more than all her predecessors together. For
all the bluster supplied by Capitol Hill and the deadlines and the sanctions
threats, Mrs Hills retaliated rarely - twice against Canada in disputes over
lumber and beer, and once against India over pharmaceutical patents.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), completed after 14 months
in a final dash before the Republican party's pre-election convention, was
the climax of her tenure. She speaks almost romantically of that 'magic
moment' in every negotiation. 'You can't slow (the negotiations) down or you
lose momentum. You can't speed them up. There's just a momentum. You want to
cut it off at the peak lest they unravel.'
She gives a lot of credit to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas for his
economic reforms. She knows that critics say the US has no business
integrating its economy with that of an autocratic regime. But she still
retains an abiding faith that 'economic reforms go hand-in-hand with
political reforms'.
Mrs Hills takes no credit for her successes, giving that to 'the team' in
her office and her congressional and private advisers. She says: 'Our trade
policy is built by consensus.'
She is even grateful for the much-maligned Washington lobbyist, whom she
defends despite criticism by foreign officials that the US private sector
has too much sway.
She says that the US, since its earliest days, has had 'people who speak out
and speak clearly about their interests'. The lobbyist is paid and biased
and might exaggerate his case, but she weighs these views with those of
industry's economists and other more objective sources. 'If you are willing
to listen to all this cacophonous sound, you get a far better picture than
if you just hole up and read a book or, worse yet, deal viscerally with
trade.'
Inside the Washington Beltway, Mrs Hills is considered one of the few stars
of the Bush cabinet, yet she is recognised as a public figure more often
overseas than in the US. Her visit to the Taj Mahal was interrupted by the
clicking of hundreds of cameras held by Japanese tourists.
She also is the only Bush cabinet official to have been burned in effigy -
in France recently by farmers protesting against the farm trade deal struck
in the Uruguay Round.
Mrs Hills is tough and tenacious, and is unlikely to stop pushing for a
final agreement on the round until Bill Clinton is sworn in as president.
Only then will she take home her packed boxes and sort out her options.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Mexico sees clear road to Nafta accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is continuing to work on the assumption that the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between Canada, Mexico and the
US will be implemented at the beginning of next year.
A senior official, commenting on last week's talks between President Carlos
Salinas and US President-elect Bill Clinton, said the latter had made clear
he had no wish to reopen negotiations on the agreement proper.
The official said Mexico had been advised this week that Mr Mickey Kantor, a
long-time Clinton adviser and nominee for the post of US trade
representative, would be appointed to tackle the bilateral issues that arise
from Nafta.
Mr Clinton underlined at a two-hour meeting with Mr Salinas in Austin,
Texas, that he would not send the enabling Nafta legislation to Congress
without first negotiating two side accords: on the environment and on jobs
protection.
Mr Salinas expressed willingness to talk about them, as long as they did not
infringe Mexican sovereignty, that they made economic sense, and would not
contradict what had already been agreed in Nafta.
The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said his
understanding was that Mr Clinton would not insist on a third side accord
mentioned by some supporters: preventing import 'surges'. This, he said, was
a trade matter already covered in Nafta, and would mean reopening
negotiations.
While it was unclear how difficult the negotiations would be on environment
and labour, it was conceivable that co-operative agreements would not even
require legislation. In any case, many of the issues related to jobs - such
as the training of displaced workers - were domestic, rather than bilateral,
matters.
He suggested that if the negotiations became tough, the Mexicans would be
more likely to insist on consideration of two other issues: migration and
development funding.
The timetable suggests the agreement would be presented for ratification in
the Canadian parliament by March, in the Mexican senate in June and in the
US Congress before or after the August recess. This would allow it to be put
into effect next January.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Testing times for Clinton team: Jurek Martin reports on the
perils of being offered a job in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS one thing to be chosen to serve as a senior member of a US
administration. It can be another successfully to run the gauntlet of
official and media scrutiny and be confirmed, unscathed and with reputation
intact, in the job.
This has been very much the experience of President-elect Bill Clinton's
nominees. It is still unlikely that any will either be rejected by the
Senate - the fate of Mr John Tower, President George Bush's defence
secretary-designate - or have to withdraw from consideration - as happened
to Mr Ernest Lefever, a controversial Reagan choice in 1981 for a senior
State Department position.
But such is the intensity of interest in the life and careers of those
chosen that few emerge unbruised. Probably even more know that they were not
selected because of something in their backgrounds that rendered them too
suspect. Those conspicuously affected by publicly disclosed problems
include:
Ron Brown, commerce secretary-to-be: on Wednesday a gala in his honour was
cancelled because its cost was being underwritten by corporations he might
find himself dealing with in the cabinet. Though the event was planned
before he was nominated and to recognise his achievements as Democratic
party national chairman, it looked too cosy for comfort and Mr Clinton urged
him to call it off.
Zoe Baird, the choice for attorney general: the New York Times reported
yesterday, on the basis of information supplied to Mr Clinton's staff and to
the FBI by Ms Baird herself, that she had employed a Peruvian couple as
housekeepers knowing them to be illegal aliens. The practice may be
commonplace, especially in Washington, but is potentially embarrassing for
anybody picked to be the country's chief law enforcement officer.
Warren Christopher, nominee for secretary of state, has had to address the
issue of what he knew 25 years ago as deputy attorney general about US army
covert surveillance of civil rights and anti-war activists. This
investigation, not in the least threatening to his confirmation, is the
handiwork of Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican Senator from North Carolina
and self-appointed scourge of anybody associated with President Jimmy
Carter's foreign policy.
Robert Reich and Laura Tyson, prospective labour secretary and head of the
Council of Economic Advisers, have been on the receiving end of much
professional jealousy from classical economists.
Mickey Kantor, chosen to be trade representative, a field in which he has no
track record, has similarly been denigrated by trade specialists.
More generally, lots of egos have been bruised by Mr Clinton's relentless
pursuit of diversity in his appointments, to the point where any number of
disgruntled hopefuls now freely complain they have been left out because
they are white and male.
This has been very much a 'top down' transitional operation, run by the
Clintons themselves and using their extensive networks of contacts.
Mr Richard Riley, the able former governor of South Carolina and education
secretary-designate, has been their chief Washington eyes and ears, with
genuine vetting influence, but real power has continued to reside in Little
Rock. This can frustrate the capital's barons who expect to be able to place
their people in senior jobs, especially since Mr Clinton seems to take his
time making up his mind.
However, the Clintons are also the victims of circumstance. All prospective
nominees to senior positions are subject to rigorous FBI background checks.
Mr Frank Weil, Mr Carter's first commerce secretary, recalls the alarm of
fishermen at his Maine holiday home at being contacted by the FBI. Ms Baird,
presumably sensing a problem that could not be kept under wraps, volunteered
her information.
Investigations are also pursued by both the media and the political
opposition, a fact of life with which Mr Clinton himself is only too
familiar from last year's campaign. Republican questioning of nominees has
to date been pretty soft and unrevelatory, but the process has barely begun,
with as many as 1,000 appointees subject to Senate confirmation.
Transitions are, by definition, ephemeral, but they are also dangerous,
particularly when a different party takes over the administration. By the
time Mr Carter took office in 1977, the word in Washington was that if his
government was no better than his transition staff then it would not fare
well.
No such closet conviction yet seriously attaches to Mr Clinton's transition.
Mr Brown is the only nominee whose professional career seems to conflict
with Mr Clinton's promise of a new and open way of doing things, but even
his critics acknowledge that he has been good at whatever task he has turned
his formidable talents to.
Interest will also soon switch to Mr Clinton's policies and away from those
he chooses to implement them. From the president-elect's perspective, the
inauguration probably cannot come soon enough.

THE Bush administration's policy of returning Haitian boat people
intercepted at sea will continue 'for the time being' under the new
government, President-elect Bill Clinton announced yesterday.
Mr Clinton had been sharply critical of the existing approach both in the
campaign and subsequently.
But he said he had been 'profoundly moved' by the dangers taken on by the
would-be Haitian refugees. Recently a boatload carrying an estimated 400
Haitians foundered, with the loss of almost all on board.
Mr Clinton also broadcast to Haiti yesterday urging its citizens not to take
to their home-made boats. He promised a renewed effort to find a democratic
solution there and cited the mediating mission of Mr Dante Caputo, the
former Argentine foreign minister.
Under intense pressure from both the Bush administration and Mr Clinton's
aides, Fr Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, has also
broadcast this week urging his countrymen not to flee to the US on the
assumption that the incoming administration would be more welcoming. He
called for the UN to dispatch human rights observers to Haiti as a first
step to restoring democracy and his own position.
Mr Clinton, pressed at a news conference about his apparent change of mind,
insisted he had always drawn a distinction between economic and political
refugees.
He said a majority of those processed for asylum by the US had been turned
down because they did not meet internationally accepted criteria.
He endorsed Fr Aristide's call for UN observers and promised to set up in
Haiti more centres to screen applicants. He also repeated that he was only
adopting an 'interim' policy, which would change 'when I am fully confident
I can do so in a way that does not contribute to a humanitarian tragedy'.
Nevertheless, the Haitian lobby in the US promptly condemned Mr Clinton for
breaking his word. He has also been accused of having made a rash commitment
to change policy before appreciating the complexities of the issue.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Dismay as Brazilian senate again delays decisive vote to
deregulate ports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER two years' struggle, the Brazilian Senate last night again delayed the
decisive vote on a controversial project to deregulate the port system, to
the dismay of the business community and disappointment of international
investors who regard port reform as a linchpin of modernisation.
The delay is a blow to President Itamar Franco, bringing to a fruitless
close this week's extraordinary session of Congress, convoked to pass such
long-outstanding projects. Fiscal reform and new privatisation rules have
also been delayed until next week.
The proposed legislation, which would allow ports to be privatised and cut
crippling port costs, is considered crucial to the government programme to
boost exports, but is opposed by port constituency senators who have delayed
the voting since February 1991.
Brazil's 35 ports are riddled with bureaucracy, served by archaic equipment,
subject to 49 different taxes, and governed by legislation unchanged since
1934. The Association of Exporters (AEB) says Brazilian port costs are the
world's highest. At the port of Santos, charges amount to Dollars 51.3 a
tonne against Dollars 4.5 in Antwerp. Mr Pratini de Moraes, head of the AEB,
says: 'We're throwing away Dollars 5bn a year in exports and 350,000
potential jobs.'
Some 97 per cent of all cargo into and out of Brazil passes through ports
and these costs explain why, despite significant tariff cuts, trade into
Brazil remains at 5 per cent of GNP, one of the lowest levels in the world.
Exports have stayed stagnant at Dollars 33bn-36bn for a decade and port
reform is seen as fundamental to the new government's plans to raise this to
Dollars 50bn by next year.
Mr Paulo Maluf, mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial centre, points out:
'We already have a geographical disadvantage: we are 8,000km from the US and
11,000km from Europe, so have larger freight costs. These, with our port
tariffs, make it impossible to compete'.
Reform is widely backed, but opposition by a few senators led by Mr Mario
Covas, has led to continuous postponement. An attempt to introduce an
amendment maintaining the stevedores' monopoly of labour has led to the
latest delay. Mr Pedro da Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade
Foundation, says the delays are a 'depressing example of how slow Brazil is
at sorting out its priorities'.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Peru to sign IMF letter of intent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU, apparently abandoning plans to extract significant concessions from
the International Monetary Fund, is expected to sign today in Washington an
IMF letter of intent to frame economic policy until 1995.
This, and the subsequent formation of a 'support group' of friendly
governments to bridge debt repayments to the multilateral lending
organisations, will mean that 'the reinsertion of Peru into the
international financial community is definitive,' according to President
Alberto Fujimori.
Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, who succeeded Mr Carlos Bolona
last week, is not expected to announce any significant concessions in the
programme negotiated by his predecessor last year.
This is despite domestic demands for increased spending, and a personal plea
in mid-December from Mr Fujimori to Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing
director, that Peru should be allowed greater economic flexibility this
year.
The realisation that the imminent US administration handover may not improve
Peru's negotiating position seems to have lent urgency to the new team's
willingness to sign.
Agreement with the IMF is a prerequisite for looming Peruvian negotiations
with the Paris Club, and for rescheduling arrears with the World Bank and
private banks.
It is hoped to resolve Peru's immediate but complex arrears position by
paying off Dollars 970m owing to the World Bank through a one-day bridging
loan from Citibank. Peru would then use Dollars 1bn in fresh funds from the
World Bank to repay Citibank.
Signature of the letter of intent will also allow the IMF's extended fund
facility to come into operation. Short-term finance from friendly
governments will permit the clearing of Dollars 900m in IMF arrears.

FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Russian scientists on market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Russian scientists are joining forces to market their services to
international industry - and fight what they see as western exploitation of
researchers in the former Soviet Union who are being offered work at
derisory rates.
Many of Russia's best-known professors, covering a wide range of scientific
and technical fields from the environment to nuclear research, have joined
the new organisation, known as Thesaurus. Institutional members include the
Russian Academy of Science and the Moscow Institute for Physics and
Technology.
Thesaurus will be marketing research and consultancy services through
Anglo-Russian Trade and Shipping, a joint venture of Robson Rhodes, the
London accountants and management consultants, and the Peter Dragadze Group
based in Moscow.
Prof Sergei Kapitza, president of Thesaurus, said scientists were keen to
work through a UK organisation because 'the British have a better attitude
to the correct compensation of labour'.
Mr Peter Dragadze said attempts by US companies to hire Russian researchers
for as little as Dollars 25 per month 'were thought to be not only offensive
but also impractical'. The price of a Thesaurus consultant is likely to be
slightly lower than for a senior western scientist.
Prof Kapitza, one of his country's best known physicists, expects Thesaurus
experts to be most in demand for physics and engineering, particularly in
energy-based industries. They could offer 'a fresh approach, a way of
thinking that might not have occurred to western scientists'.
Many Russian scientists were demoralised by the loss of status and
continuity after the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union, Prof
Kapitza admitted. 'Under socialism we were treated better than under
capitalism.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S largest farming union yesterday warned that campaigning for the
March general election must not be allowed to weaken the country's resolve
to stand up to the US in the Gatt agricultural trade negotiations.
Mr Luc Guyau, president of the FNSEA, which groups most of France's 1.2m
rural workforce, said he expected President-elect Clinton to be just as
tough as his predecessor in defending American farmers' interests.
Mr Guyau said France could not simply fall in with US plans for world
agricultural trade, aimed at cutting back subsidised EC exports. It 'should
use 1993 to move from speeches to action and veto the Washington agreement
(between the EC and US on farm trade),' he said.
He confirmed reports by agricultural suppliers such as Elf-Aquitaine and
Rhone Poulenc that, as a result of EC reforms intended to curb production,
and of uncertainties about the outcome of the Gatt talks, farmers had
sharply reduced purchases of fertilisers and pesticides. One FNSEA official
said the level fell last year to its lowest since 1960.

<TEXT>
US TRADE officials in Geneva yesterday held out little prospect for an early
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks but said negotiations
would continue in the hope of making progress by next Tuesday's stock-taking
meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee.
Trade negotiators will try to present the Clinton administration, which
takes office the following day, with as few outstanding problems as
possible, in the dwindling hope that a Uruguay Round accord can still be
reached before the current US negotiators' authority expires on March 2.
A senior US negotiator said a number of 'significant sticking points'
remained in talks with the European Community on industrial tariffs, and
there had been little progress in resolving issues of vital concern to
Washington in separate discussions on the draft package of Uruguay Round
rules.
There were still differences between the US and EC over agriculture, the
official added, despite the accord reached between the two sides last
November. He said the EC's detailed offer on market access for farm products
would, as it stands, reduce imports from current levels rather than increase
them.
Talks on the draft rules package between about 20 of the key traders taking
part in the 108-nation round were reconvened late yesterday by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The US also gave the EC further details of what it is prepared to offer on
reducing very high textiles tariffs, a key Community demand, in return for
EC concessions on reducing or eliminating tariffs in other sectors, notably
electronics.

FT  15 JAN 93 / CBS buys some expensive chat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID LETTERMAN, a 45-year-old comedian and chat show host from
Indianapolis, was last night set to be poached from NBC by CBS Television
for a salary of about Dollars 14m (Pounds 9.2m) a year, making him the
world's best-paid chat show host. For CBS, the network controlled by Mr
Larry Tisch, the billionaire investor, hiring Mr Letterman would be a
potentially profitable coup.
Both networks were scrambling yesterday to arrange press conferences, with
NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric, planning to announce in Los Angeles
that it had decided not to match the CBS offer.
Mr Letterman, an articulate showman who hosts an offbeat chat show starting
at 12.30am, has been unhappy since he lost the chance last spring to take
over the Tonight Show when Johnny Carson, host of show for decades, retired.
Instead of Mr Letterman, NBC named Jay Leno, a square-jawed comedian who has
been panned by many critics, to host the Tonight Show, which is broadcast
for an hour from 11.30 in the evening. That put Mr Leno up against ABC's
Nightline with Ted Koppel, the influential current affairs programme. CBS
was only able to offer mysteries and movies in this important time slot.
By moving from NBC to CBS Mr Letterman would not only fulfil his ambitions
by launching a programme in the 11.30 slot and competing directly with the
Tonight Show, but he would also double his salary. His negotiations have
been handled by Mr Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency (CAA),
the Hollywood talent agency that is the most powerful in the US.
NBC's management has been criticised for a sharp decline in audience ratings
over the past two years. General Electric is believed to be interested in
selling the network provided it can obtain the right price; among those
interested is a consortium headed by Bill Cosby, the comedian.

reports from Jerusalem.
The toll brings to 990 the number of Arabs killed by Israeli soldiers and
civilians in a five-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Yesterday's incidents took place in Dir el Balach and nearby Khan Yunis in
the occupied Gaza Strip and in the village of Jenin on the West Bank.
Israeli MP Mr Benjamin Netanyahu has suffered a setback in his campaign to
become the next leader of the opposition Likud party.
A media superstar during the Gulf war, Mr Netanyahu admitted yesterday to
having an extra-marital affair and said he was being blackmailed by a member
of his own party.
He was in the midst of a heated primary campaign for leadership of the
opposition Likud party which many believed he would win.

A HUGE new mural adorns Iraq's baby milk factory, which became one of its
most potent symbols from the Gulf war. The factory, which went into
production this week, was flattened by the western allies, who claimed it
was a secret chemical weapons plant. However, its reopening will provide
little more than a symbolic dent in Iraq's need for baby milk. The issue of
what use the factory was put to before the war has never been fully
resolved. Iraq has consistently denied it mixed or stored chemicals there.

<TEXT>
CATHAY PACIFIC, Hong Kong's international airline, was last night facing its
worst industrial action since 1985 after cabin crews went on strike,
claiming the airline had inadequate staffing levels, writes Simon Holberton
in Hong Kong.
Half of Cathay's 28 outbound flights and 13 of its 31 inbound flights were
cancelled. The company was unable to determine how many of the 4,000 cabin
attendants were on strike.
Industrial action is virtually unknown in Hong Kong. Cathay's last serious
dispute was in 1985, when ground staff went on strike.
The dispute centres on Cathay's requirement that its cabin attendants accept
working 'out of position'. This has meant that senior cabin attendants have
had to operate in junior positions in the event of a staff shortage due to
sickness. A Flight Attendants Union official said yesterday Cathay employed
300 fewer cabin attendants than it should, but the company denied this.
'There is no shortage of cabin attendants, our staff grows in line with the
growth in our fleet,' it said.
Hong Kong's Labour Department offered to mediate in the dispute, which has
been brewing over the past three months.

<TEXT>
NEXT Wednesday the 31 executive board members of the World Health
Organisation are due to cast their votes for director-general of the United
Nations agency, bringing to a head a long and unusually bitter election
campaign that has set the US and Japan at loggerheads.
An internal US State Department paper has accused Japan of 'aggressive
tactics, including the pursuit of votes in exchange for favours' in the
quest for support for the incumbent Japanese director-general, Dr Hiroshi
Nakajima.
Japan, which strongly denies the charge, claims the US government is waging
a disinformation campaign against it and Dr Nakajima, based on little more
than the personal animosities of a few key officials at the US health
department.
For Tokyo, the re-election of Dr Nakajima for a second five-year term has
become not simply a matter of national pride but a crucial test of
international good faith in urging Japan to take a greater role in world
affairs.
'In the eyes of the Japanese people, Dr Nakajima is a symbol of Japan's
contribution to the international community,' says Mr Masao Kawai, a senior
official in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The WHO chief is the only
Japanese to have been elected (rather than appointed) to a top UN position.
The US is backing the candidacy of Dr Mohamed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian
neurologist, who was Dr Nakajima's deputy at the WHO until sacked from his
post last August after announcing he would run against his boss. Dr
Abdelmoumene, who says he was asked to stand for director-general by a
number of rich and poor countries, has the official backing of the European
Community and the Arab League, but Dr Nakajima claims strong support from
developing countries who are in the majority on the executive board.
The US pays about a quarter of the WHO's Dollars 850m (Pounds 552m) annual
budget. Japan, which has rapidly increased contributions since Dr Nakajima
took over as director-general, to become WHO's second-biggest paymaster,
last year paid about Dollars 57m. Both governments deny that contributions
will be cut if the wrong man wins.
Dr Nakajima's faults, on the face of it, do not seem very grave. He is
accused of an authoritarian management style, of travelling too much and of
being a poor communicator. Furthermore, he was involved in an embarassing
incident last year after an official visit to Russia when customs officials
at a Moscow airport confiscated six icons in his baggage which he had not
declared.
Dr Nakajima's supporters argue that he has improved the running of the
organisation since taking over in 1988 from Dr Halfdan Mahler, a Dane, and
that he has initiated valuable work to achieve 'basic health' in developing
countries.
However, it is clear that Dr Nakajima has not won the hearts and minds of
WHO staff, who complain of a lack of vision and leadership. There has been a
steady exodus of senior officials, including the sudden resignation in March
1990 of Dr Jonathan Mann, a high-profile American who headed WHO's programme
on Aids.
US officials say their opposition to Dr Nakajima is based solely on concern
for the ability of WHO effectively to tackle big health challenges.
Within the WHO itself, executive board members are allegedly being wooed
with top-level visits, promises of aid and top jobs - practices, it must be
said, which are widespread throughout the UN system, often backed by
national governments.
US officials too are alleged to have hinted that American backing for WHO
activities could wane if Dr Nakajima is re-elected.

MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, said yesterday Japan wanted to
promote co-operation and resilience in Asia and denied any plans to make
Japan a regional military power.
Mr Miyazawa, in Malaysia as part of a South-East Asia tour, said the
continued presence of US forces in the region was vital and Japan was
providing increasing support to the US military. 'We do not want to see a
power vacuum in the region,' a Japanese official said.
In talks with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, Mr Miyazawa
outlined Japan's new 'Look East' policy, which suggests a greater regional
role for Japan in the years ahead.
But While Mr Miyazawa said Japan wanted to create greater economic and
political co-operation in the region, he declined to endorse Dr Mahathir's
proposal for an east Asia economic caucus, a trading group linking the
fast-expanding economies of east Asia.
Malaysia feels this would be vital to counter what it sees as increasing
protectionism in the European Community and Nafta.

AUSTRALIA'S unemployment rate fell by 0.1 points to 11.3 per cent in
December, the government said yesterday.
Mr Peter Baldwin, the junior employment minister, said the fall was
consistent with continued growth in the economy, which is recovering from an
18-month recession.
However, economists said it was probably a technical correction following a
large increase in the previous month. Unemployment is likely to rise over
the next three months as school leavers enter the employment market.
The weak jobs market will contribute to growing pressure on the government
to produce a fiscal stimulus before the next election, which must be held by
June. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, is believed to have been
working on a series of policy proposals to be announced before the election
is called.
The government is unlikely to stimulate the economy by easing monetary
policy because of continued weakness of the Australian dollar.

MR Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the separatist Tamil Tigers, has called
for peace talks to end Sri Lanka's 10-year civil war, after meeting a church
delegation in Jaffna, the island's northern capital, last week.
Mr Kenneth Fernando, the Anglican Archbishop of Colombo and leader of the
delegation, said on his return to the capital yesterday that Mr Prabhakaran
had called for an immediate ceasefire and the holding of peace talks.
In a rare public appearance Mr Prabhakaran, recently charged in an Indian
court with masterminding the assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, had set out
conditions for negotiations with the government, he said.
The Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) wanted the 'economic blockade'
of the northern peninsula lifted. The government must also pledge the
reconstruction of the northern province and the rehabilitation of about
100,000 Tamil refugees.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Algerians to vote on new constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S acting head of state, Mr Ali Kafi, yesterday promised a referendum
on the future of North Africa's largest country whose security forces have,
for the past 12 months, been mired in ever bloodier confrontation with
radical Islamic groups.
The referendum would submit to the Algerian people a draft new constitution
and seek their endorsement for a transitional arrangement before a new
constitution was enacted.
Mr Kafi promised that political parties would be invited to give their views
on future strategy but added that 'all those who practised or supported
violence' would be excluded.
This was a clear reference to those Algerians who support the Islamic
Salvation Front which was banned last February after Algerian leaders
cancelled the second round of elections the party was poised to win.
Other smaller Islamic parties such as Ennahda would, however, be asked to
join in such talks.
Mr Kafi is a founding member of the five-man High State Council (HCE) which
has acted as the country's collective presidency since the former head of
state, Mr Chadli Bendjedid, resigned a year ago.
He has chaired the HCE since the slaying of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, who returned
last January from 28 years' exile in Morocco to become acting president.
Mr Kafi did not suggest any precise date on which the referendum might be
held, but most observers assume it is likely to take place later this year.
The High State Council members have proclaimed on more than one occasion
that they did not wish to hold office beyond December 1993, when Mr Chadli's
third term of office was due to end, nor would any of them stand in any
future presidential election.
Meanwhile, the visit by Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, to
Algiers last weekend, and Defence Minister Khaled Nezzar's present visit to
Saudi Arabia, have helped to break the semi-quarantine the country's leaders
have been held in since last January's events.
Mr Dumas promised that France would 'express its friendship by other means
than mere words'.
This can be taken as a strong pointer that his government will extend a
helping financial hand to a country whose foreign debt service ratio of 73
per cent leaves it scant room to import the raw materials necessary to
increase industrial output.

FT  15 JAN 93 / UN struggles to avert Angola nightmare: Michael Holman on
the waning prospects for a lasting end to the 16-year conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAD the makings of a nightmare, the senior UN official said last May when
contemplating the biggest obstacle in the path of Angola's transition from
16 years of civil war to multi-party democracy.
The demobilisation of the country's rival armies was going badly, he warned;
weapons were cached, discipline was poor, and the timetable was slipping.
Less than a year later, his grim vision has become reality as Angola slides
back into civil war, triggered by Unita leader Jonas Savimbi's rejection of
the September election which gave victory to President Eduardo dos Santos
and the ruling MPLA.
Over 1,500 people are reported to have died in the past two weeks and
fighting continued yesterday in and around Huambo, the central highlands
city currently held by Unita.
Last-ditch efforts to restore peace, in which Ms Margaret Anstee, the UN
special representative based in Luanda, will play a key role, may yet bear
fruit. Diplomats in the Angolan capital said Mr Venancio de Moura, the
country's foreign minister, had on Tuesday at a meeting with Portuguese,
Russian and US observers and Ms Anstee, formally proposed talks with Unita.
But western diplomats warn that forging a lasting settlement will be a
frustrating process, undermined by old enmities, tribal rivalries, Mr
Savimbi's overriding ambition, and the temptation of controlling proceeds
from the country's 500,000 b/d oil sector.
Should peace efforts fail, an early military victory for either side seems
unlikely, they say. Instead, there will be what a US diplomat yesterday
called 'a process of mutual enfeeblement until both forces go back to the
negotiating table'.
No one is sure how long that would take. A broad assessment by western
analysts puts the MPLA in control of the main towns, while Unita can operate
relatively freely in 75 per cent of the countryside.
Both sides have lost allies: the 50,000-strong Cuban contingent that fought
alongside the MPLA has long since departed. Namibia's independence has
deprived Unita of what amounted to a rear base in the formerly South
African-controlled territory. Pretoria, which sent troops into Angola in
support of Unita, seems unlikely again to come to the help of Mr Savimbi in
any substantial way.
Zaire remains a valuable Unita ally, but its role as a conduit for US
military and other assistance ended with the departure of the Cubans.
Meanwhile Washington has increasingly distanced itself from Mr Savimbi,
embarrassed by his human rights record, and sceptical of his claims of
election rigging. The incoming Democrat administration will take an even
tougher stand.
Unita has also been weakened by divisions within its ranks, which came to a
head last year when senior officials deserted Mr Savimbi following the
murder of a former aide. Tensions remain, illustrated earlier this week when
Mr Abel Chivukuvuku, Unita's secretary for foreign affairs, and General
Peregrino Huambu, its military intelligence chief, called for an immediate
end to fighting.
Both men were captured in October during fighting in Luanda which saw Unita
driven from the capital. But whether speaking under duress or not, their
absence from the battlefield must be a blow to Mr Savimbi.
Whatever the outcome of mediation efforts, no one doubts that Angola's best
chance for peace was squandered last year. Implementation of the peace plan
was weak, the timetable proved unrealistic and resources for the exercise
were too few.
Central to the success of the transition was the requirement that soldiers
and guerrillas from rival armies report to 50 assembly points, to be
monitored by UN forces, before being demobilised or entering an integrated
national army. Both sides were suspected of caching weapons and those that
were surrendered were not securely held.
As election day approached, only 1,500 soldiers had been sworn in to an
integrated national army supposed to number 40,000. Tens of thousands of
government and Unita soldiers were still in demobilisation camps, most of
them with ready access to weapons. A further 40,000 men of the
150,000-strong combined forces had yet to be demobilised.
Western diplomats now acknowledge that they could have acted differently,
insisting that elections could not proceed until both sides respected the
terms of the peace pact signed in May 1991.
'As I listened to the speeches that evening and watched MPLA and Unita
leaders mingling, I knew that we were celebrating the end of an era,' wrote
Mr Chester Crocker, predecessor to Mr Cohen, and the the architect of the
south-west African settlement.
It proved premature. This time round, scepticism, not optimism, is the mood
of Angola's would-be peace makers.

FT  15 JAN 93 / US businesses plan a return to Vietnam: The war is nearly
over and the trade embargo may soon be dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our New York Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN companies are beginning to weigh up business prospects in Vietnam
following a White House move last month which paves the way for eventual
removal of the long-standing US embargo on the Communist nation.
In one of the clearest signs of growing US business interest, a group of
executives from some two dozen US companies will visit the country early
next month under the auspices of the new Vietnam-American Chamber of
Commerce.
It will be the first US business mission to be formally received by the
Hanoi government, according to the chamber's president, Mr Irwin Robinson, a
New York lawyer. The aim, he says, 'will be to maximise knowledge of
opportunities for US companies.'
The US has enforced its trade ban since the Vietnam war but over the past
year the White House has allowed a few exceptions. For example, a ban on
telecommunications links was lifted in April 1992.
The biggest move yet came on December 14 when President George Bush signed
an order permitting US companies to sign contracts with Vietnamese parties
and open offices there. However, contracts can only be executed if relations
are normalised.
There has been speculation that Mr Bush could do this before he leaves
office on January 20, if Hanoi meets the White House's demands for the
fullest possible accounting for missing American servicemen and prisoners of
war, including repatriation of their remains.
However, there remains very little time for Vietnam to make these
concessions, while Mr Bush may be reluctant to stir up the right-wing outcry
such a move would provoke.
The new Clinton administration, for its part, is likely to have much more
pressing concerns, and President-elect Bill Clinton may be wary of
normalising relations rapidly, given the election campaign controversy over
his Vietnam draft record.
Whenever the ban is lifted, it is bound to provoke a sharp increase in US
business interest, not least because this will also trigger a wave of aid to
the country from institutions such as the World Bank, creating opportunities
for capital equipment and construction contracts.
However, Mr Nicholas Ludlow, managing director of Development Bank
Associates, a Washington-based consultancy, says the economy is so
under-developed that it has limited capacity to absorb new trade and
investment.
'I think there will be a wave of excitement, then tempered by a more
realistic view of the prospects,' he says. 'Companies will do best which
realise Vietnam is a long-term prospect.'
Guocang Huan, of the emerging markets group at JP Morgan, the New York bank,
says the country's extremely low wage costs, currently about a tenth of
Taiwan's and Korea's, could make it attractive for investment by
labour-intensive US companies. He argues that industries such as electronics
and textiles are most likely to prosper in Vietnam, together with tourism.
However, companies from across the US business spectrum are starting to
focus on the country. The 21 members of the Vietnam-American Chamber of
Commerce include Federal Express, the package delivery company, Honeywell,
the controls group, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, and ITT.
Sectors likely to be particularly interested in Vietnam include:
Airlines. A number of US carriers may be interested in serving the market -
particularly those such as United and Northwest Airlines, which have a
strong presence in the Far East already.
Procedurally, the first step would be for the Department of Transportation
to negotiate a bilateral aviation agreement, setting permitted levels of
service and agreeing the number of providers, with the Vietnamese. The
aviation authorities would then seek applications to serve the route.
Minneapolis-based Northwest makes no secret of its enthusiasm. 'We've been
interested in serving Vietnam for several years. We see it as a growing and
promising market,' it says.
Banks. A number are interested in returning to Vietnam, including Bank of
America, Chase Manhattan and Citibank, each of which had branches in Saigon
before the Americans were driven out of South Vietnam in 1975.
The Bank of America says: 'We have definitely expressed our interest in a
return to Vietnam.' The bank said that as a preliminary step last summer it
had opened an Indochina representative office in Hong Kong, whose operations
would be moved to Vietnam if the US embargo were lifted.
One matter that will need to be sorted out before banks return is the the
issue of unresolved claims by depositors dating back to Communist takeover
of South Vietnam.
Oil. US companies are keen to explore the South China Sea, with three
companies - Amoco, Chevron and Mobil - giving the most active consideration
to a business plan.
Chevron said it had held discussions with the Vietnamese 'on and off with
regard to possible opportunities for exploring and producing offshore in the
South China Sea, but we don't have any contracts.'
Chevron said it had examined geological data and was 'interested in the
possibilities.'
Mobil was more direct: 'Should the embargo end we would be most interested
to be there. In the meantime we will explore some potential opportunities by
talking to potential partners.'
Telecommunications. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI Communications,
the two largest long-distance US carriers, have begun to provide
long-distance services to Vietnam following the relaxation of the ban last
April. MCI says it is sending a team to Vietnam in the first quarter to
discuss additional services, such as allowing customers to call the US
collect. But it says it has no interest in the domestic Vietnamese market.
Consumer products. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola says it 'would certainly look at
Vietnam' if trade relations normalise - in line with a general policy of
examining all potential new markets.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Karachi awaits next move by army
</HEADLINE>

   KARACHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial heart, have relaxed their guard
since the army was sent last May to restore order in the southern province
of Sindh, of which it is the capital.
The army says over a hundred gangs involved in robberies, kidnappings, car
thefts and drug peddling have been smashed in Karachi, and no kidnappings
for ransom have taken place in the last two months. Before the troops
arrived, kidnappings of businessmen were frequent.
Signs of improved law and order are visible on the streets. Many shops are
open later, and businessmen previously afraid of being kidnapped or robbed
are more relaxed when travelling. 'The situation has improved since the army
has come in. We feel much more secure than before,' says Mr Ali Mashhadi, a
carpet dealer.
However, security is due to be reviewed this month. The government could
order the troops back to barracks if the situation was judged to have
improved sufficiently.
There are signs of differences between civilian and military leaders over
the future of the operation.
The provincial government of Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, which is backed by
the ruling alliance of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, wants the army to
stay until there is complete assurance that gangs of criminals will not
resurface, a senior official says.
Generals are concerned, however, that improvement in law and order needs to
be backed by socio-economic measures to curb poverty, rising unemployment
and drug addiction. Only with such action, they argue, will long-term
improvement in the security situation be assured. 'The malaise is political,
economic and social. This is not a military problem,' says one general.
Unemployed young people in Karachi's growing slums are prime targets for
recruitment to crime gangs.
The chairman of a large industrial company says: 'Good municipal planning to
cater for the needs of ordinary people is an absolute must for improving
conditions in Karachi. Unfortunately, there is very little of that going on
right now.'
Some businessmen argue that to ensure long term socio- economic development,
the government in Islamabad should introduce tax incentives to accelerate
business growth in Karachi, stimulating employment.
Mr Tahir Khaliq of Karachi's chamber of commerce says new investments are
badly needed and will only come if there are new concessions. He is
concerned about the possibility of political troubles if the army pulls out.
The army operation led to the discovery of torture cells and extortion rings
in Karachi, allegedly run by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a party for Moslems
who had migrated from India.
Businessmen are waiting anxiously for the government's decision. Mr Khaliq
says: 'If the government is confident that things have certainly improved
and if they feel that the army can be called back, I just hope that they
know what they are doing and they realise fully what could be the
consequences.'

FT  15 JAN 93 / French cohabitation unlikely to follow path of true love:
The right is heading for a crushing election victory, but President
Mitterrand has plenty of tricks in store
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is soon to become embroiled in a constitutional chess game between
the wily but ageing President Francois Mitterrand and a powerful but
fragmented right-wing.
The next move will be the March parliamentary election, where the Socialists
face crushing defeat by a coalition of RPR Gaullists and the centre-right
UDF, who, if recent polls are right, will take at least 400 seats in the
577-seat national assembly.
This will usher in a second period of 'cohabitation' between a left-wing
president and right-wing government. The right is likely to have a far
larger majority this time than in the first, in 1986-88, and Mr Mitterrand
is much less popular now than then. It is seen as the beginning of the end
for Mr Mitterrand, 76, whose term runs out in two years.
But as usual, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Mr Mitterrand has distanced
himself from daily politics and even from his own party, to concentrate on
what looks at first like a somewhat academic plan to reform the
constitution.
Yet it is far from that. Mr Mitterrand has taken the high ground in a
running public debate, led by the right which campaigns against Mr
Mitterrand's 'monarchical drift', on whether France wants to move from a
presidential system to a more parliamentary style of democracy.
In this way he has chosen, following Napoleon's first rule of engagement,
his own battlefield for the election campaign which is now getting under way
and for the early days of the next national assembly.
The main drift of the reform plan, launched by Mr Mitterrand last month, is
to strengthen one of Europe's weakest parliaments at the expense of the
prime minister and government, but not of the president.
He has suggested, for example, curbs on the government's freedom to override
parliament. The government has in the past four years resorted 19 times to a
guillotine motion under the constitution's Article 49-3 to pass legislation
without a vote, a technique which has contributed to the Socialist party's
unpopularity. A shortening of the seven-year presidential term is also up
for discussion, though Mr Mitterrand says this would apply to future
presidents, not him.
A consultative committee of lawyers and academics invited by the government
and boycotted by the right, is due to report to the president on
constitutional reform by February 15. He will then table his plan, one of
the first pieces of legislation to be discussed by the new parliament at its
first sitting starting on April 2, less than a week after the election.
The opposition suspects this is another Mitterrand trap to unsettle the new
government. Others believe it is no more than a struggle for personal power.
Mr Mitterrand's approach to the first cohabitation government - to preserve
essential policies and prepare for the next presidential election - has
given way to 'a strategy of personal convenience,' writes Jean-Marie
Colombani, Le Monde's political editor.
In practice, the end of the succession of Socialist governments going back
to 1981 will mean little change to daily life.
For one thing, the leadership of the right holds almost the same policies as
the Socialists on most of the big issues of the day, including the need to
defend the franc, on foreign policy, privatisation and on employment.
The election would be lost on the Socialists' battered image and
personalities, rather than on ideas. Differences within the right on some
issues, like the strong franc, are far greater than between the leaderships
of the right and of the Socialists.
Furthermore, the right's expected majority would be so large that it would
be under no obvious pressure to change, barring a serious revolution within
the ranks.
Much of what happens next in Mr Mitterrand's constitutional power struggle
will depend on the skill of the next prime minister in weaving his way round
the right's internal splits and the president's tactics. Here Mr Mitterrand
holds an important advantage, for only he has the right to choose the prime
minister, who then has to carry out an uncomfortable balancing act between
running the government competently and not overshadowing the president. 'He
must not fail, otherwise he runs the risk of being sacked ..still more he
must not succeed, for to do so would be the ultimate impertinence,' the
satirical newspaper Canard Enchaine once wrote.*
Mr Edouard Balladur, a former RPR finance minister, who masterminded policy
in the last cohabitation government, is hotly tipped for the job. Mr Jacques
Chirac, the RPR leader and former prime minister, does not want to stand
again because he has presidential ambitions. Mr Balladur has kept aloof
enough from the fray to be able to work with Mr Mitterrand. In the end, the
leader of the next right government depends on Mr Mitterrand's private
instincts - and they will remain private until he alone decides the time is
right.

FT  15 JAN 93 / 'Tamilgate': something rotten in the state of Denmark -
Hilary Barnes reports on the background and possible consequences of
Copenhagen's gravest post-war political scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT STARTED with an illegal decision by a Danish minister of justice, and
snowballed when his cabinet colleagues tried to cover up for him. Yesterday
the affair that has become known as 'Tamilgate' turned into Denmark's most
damaging political scandal since 1945.
The prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, who had held the office for more than
10 years, resigned last night in disgrace following the publication of a
6,000-page report by a judicial inquiry. The minority Conservative-Liberal
coalition over which he had presided also looks unlikely to survive.
His departure has plunged Denmark into political uncertainty just two weeks
after it took over the rotating presidency of the European Community. It has
removed a leader whose talents as a conciliator gave the country an
unaccustomed degree of political stability. And it may, in the short term at
least, prompt another burst of speculation against the Danish krone, which
has been sporadically under pressure in Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The affair began in 1987, when the then justice minister, Mr Erik
Ninn-Hansen, ordered civil servants to delay entry visas for the wives and
children of Tamil refugees, although the Tamils had an explicit right under
Danish law to bring their families to the country. The affair began to
become a serious liability for the government when it emerged that attempts
were made to prevent the parliamentary ombudsman from looking into the case.
The controversy turned on whether the prime minister tried to cover up parts
of the scandal in a 1989 speech to parliament. Yesterday's report by High
Court judge Mogens Hornslet was damning in its conclusions. Mr Schluter 'has
given the Folketing (parliament) and the Folketing's justice committee
incomplete information, and in the commission's view, he must have known
it', Judge Hornslet concluded. The judge found that in his 1989 speech, the
prime minister misled MPs on nine separate points and provided them with
information which was 'directly wrong'. The word 'lie' is not used.
Mr Ninn-Hansen's successor as minister of justice, Mr H P Clausen, who is
now parliamentary speaker, also said last night he would resign after being
strongly criticised for giving misleading and incorrect information to
parliament.
A lawyer by profession, Mr Schluter was Denmark's longest-serving post-war
prime minister. When he took office in September 1982, ending the 50-year
domination of Danish politics by the Social Democratic party, the country
was suffering from huge balance of payments and budget deficits and neither
he nor anyone else thought that his government would endure for more than a
few months.
Instead he will be remembered as the leader of a government which restored
the country's finances. There is now a large current account surplus and
although the budget has recently dipped into the red again, it is one of the
smallest deficits in the EC.
On at least two occasions Mr Schluter showed great political courage. In
1985, a centre-left majority in parliament was prepared to prevent Denmark
ratifying the Single European Act. He dished the opposition by calling a
referendum.
In 1988, the same parties created a crisis in the country's relations with
Nato by demanding that alliance vessels entering Danish waters should
declare whether or not they were carrying nuclear weapons. On that occasion
Mr Schluter settled the issue by calling a general election.
Following Mr Schluter's resignation, confusion prevails. An election is
unlikely. So there will now be an interregnum while the eight Folketing
parties try to establish majority support for a successor. The outgoing
prime minister has nominated Mr Henning Dyremose, the finance minister, but
it was unclear yesterday whether he would obtain the necessary support, or
whether there will be a change of government, which might let in the Social
Democrats after 10 years in opposition.
Although Denmark's political crisis may leave the EC rudderless for the time
being, political commentators in Copenhagen do not expect it to affect the
outcome of the second Danish referendum on Maastricht, probably in May.

<TEXT>
THE POLISH ferry which capsized in a fierce storm off Germany's Baltic coast
yesterday - with the loss of 54 of the 63 people on board - had capsized on
two previous occasions, Reuter reports from Stralsund, Germany.
The Jan Heweliusz, built in 1977 and run by the privatised Polish company,
Euroafrica, was sailing from Ystad in Sweden to the Polish port of
Swinoujscie when in it turned over in heavy seas and winds of up to 100 mph.
German police said bodies were still being recovered and there were six
survivors among the 28 crew and 32 passengers, who were mainly truck
drivers.
Poland has set up a committee of inquiry. Officials suggested that the storm
may have caused one or more of 10 railway wagons on board to break free from
couplings.
The Jan Heweliusz had capsized on two previous occasions, in August 1982,
while loading at Ystad, and four years earlier, because of a fault in valves
regulating the ballast tanks. The ferry was the same type as the Herald of
Free Enterprise which capsized off Zeebrugge in March 1987, with the loss of
189 lives.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Kohl close to deal on 'solidarity pact'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Germany's ruling coalition claimed yesterday to have made 'huge
progress' in finalising proposals for the planned 'solidarity pact' between
the government, opposition, employers and trade unions, intended to finance
the soaring cost of unification.
Final plans will be presented to the parliamentary parties in the coalition
next Tuesday, but they then have to be agreed with trade unions and the
Social Democratic Party (SPD) opposition, which remain decidedly sceptical.
The government parties, including Mr Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the
minority Free Democrats (FDP), remain determined to cut back in some areas
of social spending. These cuts are fiercely opposed by the SPD.
They have also agreed on other savings measures, including a ceiling of 3
per cent on public sector pay - and 2 per cent for civil servants -
according to today's issue of Handelsblatt, the German business daily.
Other measures include taxation of life insurance policies, and to raise
taxation on insurances from 10 to 12 per cent. Overall, they are looking to
cut back public expenditure in the west by some DM12bn (Pounds 4.9bn).
Firm evidence of a reduction in the state deficit, as well as restraint from
the trade unions, is demanded by the Bundesbank as a precondition for any
early relaxation in its high interest rate policy.
The most tangible sign of progress in recent days, as the pace of
negotiations for the pact has stepped up dramatically, has been the
agreement of the German banking sector to increase loans to east German
enterprises by DM1bn (Pounds 400m), on top of a similar commitment from the
insurance industry.
The banks' agreement was made on Monday, in talks with Mr Horst Kohler, the
state secretary for finance. However, it now has to be worked out in detail
with the Treuhand privatisation agency in eastern Germany.
The money is intended to provide credit for Treuhand enterprises which have
not yet been privatised, but which are considered 'capable of being
restructured'.
An agreement on saving such eastern 'core' enterprises is likely to be a key
part of the solidarity pact, in exchange for which the trade unions are
supposed to promise real restraint in their wage demands.
At the same time, the central government and the 11 western Lander are
supposed to agree on drastic savings in their budgets, in order to provide
adequate finance for the bankrupt eastern Lander.
An inconclusive round of talks was held by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, with a committee of finance ministers from the Lander last
weekend, and further talks are expected on Sunday.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Central bankers believe ERM dangers receding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central banks of countries still in the European exchange rate mechanism
are confident that the four-month crisis in the European Monetary System is
past its peak.
An upbeat appraisal of the ERM's prospects at a meeting of EC central bank
governors in Basle this week was reflected in comments at Wednesday's
meeting in Frankfurt of the privately organised G7 Council.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice president, said there was no longer
any reason for a realignment of parities in the European exchange rate
mechanism following the adjustments of recent months.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, governor of the Netherlands central bank, went further:
'What crisis?', he asked. The problem with the ERM was that 'we had
forgotten how to realign'. The upheavals that had shaken the system since
September simply added up to 'one realignment that lasted four months'.
The bullish tone was tempered by doubts among officials from non-EC nations
and countries that had been forced to quit the system and scepticism among
some of the bankers and financiers attending the Frankfurt G7 Council
meeting. Currency markets also remain concerned about the ability of the
Irish punt and Danish krone to maintain their current parities.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the director general of the Bank of Italy, urged a
co-ordinated reduction in European interest rates as soon as possible to
promote economic convergence among EC countries. One UK official expressed
concern that tensions could reappear nearer to the French national assembly
elections in March.
Such doubts would be greatly reduced if Germany's high short term interest
rates were to ease soon. On Tuesday night, Mr Michel Sapin, the French
finance minister, predicted 'a significant and durable drop of interest
rates in Europe' this year.
This bold forecast gained some support from the Bundesbank. Although Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Tietmeyer insisted that
the German central bank would not relax its drive for low inflation, they
made clear that the bank was prepared to allow some flexibility in operating
its policy.
However, lower interest rates ultimately depend on the German government
finalising negotiations on a 'solidarity pact' that will control Germany's
public sector deficits and rising labour costs growth.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Russia goes for breakneck sell-off
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of Russian companies are to be sold at breakneck speed in a
political gamble to make privatisation irreversible by April, when the
country faces a referendum over its future constitution and fresh
parliamentary elections.
Fourteen of Russia's 49 regions are to be included in a campaign to sell
around 500 big and medium-sized enterprises, Russian authorities and their
western advisers said yesterday. Other regions will proceed at their own
pace in contributing to the goal of selling 6,500 enterprises this year.
Russia is taking a different approach to eastern Europe where privatisation
was slow, mainly because enterprises were restructured before sale and
large-scale privatisation was under centralised control. Russian reformers
argue they have neither the time nor money to proceed the same way.
'Rather than looking for good companies to sell, our objective is to sell
all companies,' said Mr Anthony Doran, an executive from the International
Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm advising five of the
regions. Accountancy firm Price Waterhouse is to help with privatisation in
another five.
Up to 51 per cent of shares will be sold to the workforce and remaining
stakes will be offered for cash and privatisation vouchers to be distributed
to every Russian citizen by the end of this month. There are no restrictions
on foreigners taking part even though few are expected to do so at this
stage.
The pilot project is to kick off in the Volgograd region, better known by
its wartime name of Stalingrad, where 200 companies up for sale will include
the tractor plant which switched to tank production during World War Two.
Enterprises are being cleared for auction by regional authorities after
passing basic 'survivability tests' which amount to a snapshot of their
condition over a relatively short period.

FT  15 JAN 93 / EC agrees terms for Italian loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's monetary committee last night approved the terms for an Ecu8bn
(Pounds 6.47bn) balance of payments loan to Italy.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC commissioner for economic and financial
affairs, is expected to produce a formal proposal for the loan today. EC
finance ministers will debate the proposal at their first meeting of the
year on Monday.
Following yesterday's meeting of the monetary committee, which is made up of
senior EC central bank and treasury officials, ministers are expected to
insist on strict budgetary requirements as a condition for approval, but
details were not made available.
The loan will be in four tranches, two to be paid this year. The last two
will be paid in 1994 and 1995, but only after the budget for those years has
been scrutinised.
Italy asked for the loan last October, partly in an attempt to offset the
loss of reserves used in supporting the lira during the September currency
crisis.
Rome now wants to return to the ERM if it can get international financial
backing and enter at a rate which will not simply encourage speculators to
force the lira out again.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Irish punt battle enters key phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government's four-month battle to defend the punt within the
European exchange rate mechanism enters a critical phase this weekend, as
renewed selling of the currency yesterday frustrated efforts by the central
bank to bring wholesale money market rates down sharply.
Last weekend, the central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 100 per
cent in response to heavy selling of the punt, which drove it below its ERM
floor against the Dutch guilder and Belgian franc.
In the past three days, the bank has progressively reduced its money market
rates in an attempt to avert a threatened rise in commercial base rates
which would further hurt the Irish economy.
But this week's attempt to cut money market rates has already put pressure
on the Irish currency, which was again trading near to its ERM floor.
The government reaffirmed yesterday that it will not devalue or realign the
punt and added that it is 'concerned that the European authorities have so
far been unable to re-establish the previous stability after so many months
and to convince the market of their determination to resist further
re-alignments or devaluations'.
The central bank announced yesterday that it was again dropping its
overnight lending rate back to 15 per cent, having dropped it to 30 per cent
by Wednesday. This permitted the one-month rate to fall from 60 per cent at
the beginning of the week, to around 25 per cent yesterday.
Renewed selling pressure yesterday drove the one-month rate back up to
around 35 per cent.
The first cabinet meeting yesterday of the new coalition government
discussed outline proposals for the introduction of an exchange rate
guarantee scheme to enable companies to borrow funds more cheaply abroad.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, is to hold a crucial meeting today
with the heads of the main building societies to consider means of keeping
down mortgage rates, or alternatively to cushion mortgage holders from the
impact of a likely 3 percentage-point rise in mortgage rates early next
week.
Details of the schemes are expected to be finalised over the weekend and
released early next week.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Denmark plunged into crisis as PM quits over scandal:
Schluter criticised for misinforming parliament on Tamil refugees affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK, current holder of the European Community presidency, was thrown
into political crisis yesterday when Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister since
1982, announced his resignation after a judicial inquiry savagely criticised
him for misinforming parliament.
Mr Schluter, 63, the leader of the Conservative party, gave the Folketing,
Denmark's parliament, misleading and incorrect information in 1989 on a
scandal surrounding the government's attitude to Tamil refugees from Sri
Lanka, and he must have known this, said the report released yesterday.
Mr Schluter nominated Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister in the minority
Conservative-Liberal coalition government, to succeed him. But it was
increasingly doubtful last night that Mr Dyremose could win majority
support.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party,
called for the establishment of a broad coalition. Negotiations between
party leaders for a new government were also demanded by the Radical
Liberals and the Centre Democrats, two small parties which have hitherto
supported Mr Schluter's government.
Constitutional experts said a general election was unlikely, and could only
be called once a new prime minister was installed. The next election is not
due until the end of 1994.
The upheaval could complicate plans for a second referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on European union, although Danish officials insisted
yesterday a switch of government would not harm prospects for Maastricht
since seven of the eight parliamentary parties support the treaty after the
special deal on opt-outs agreed at the Edinburgh summit last month. Last
June, Danish voters narrowly rejected Maastricht in a referendum.
In London, Downing Street said there was no reason to suppose Mr Schluter's
resignation would significantly affect the timing of the second Danish
referendum on Maastricht, even if it led to an election. Nonetheless the
timing is awkward for British ratification as MPs are in the middle of
detailed discussion of the bill to approve Maastricht.
Diplomats and Commission officials in Brussels said they believed the
resignation would not have a dramatic effect on the smooth running of the
Danish presidency of the EC, which ends in June. Most refused to commit
themselves until it was clear how the government crisis would be resolved.
A spokesman for Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC's new commissioner for
external relations, would say only that 'it's not clear yet what the
implications are'.
An Irish diplomat said it would be difficult for someone to step into Mr
Schluter's shoes in the EC presidency, given the personalised nature of the
job. 'Obviously for someone to change in midstream isn't desirable, because
you are losing the preparation that the original people have done in the
run-up to the presidency,' he said.
Ahead of the news, the Copenhagen all-share index dipped 2.39 points to
263.73 yesterday, but government bond prices remained stable.
The resignation also came too late to affect the krone in European foreign
exchange trading. But there have been concerns in recent days that a
political crisis could undermine the currency, which is already close to its
floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.
After opening in London at DKr3.8615 to the D-Mark, the krone weakened in
the morning in Europe to about DKr3.8750 as the contents of the Tamilgate
report filtered out. After the resignation announcement, it was quoted at
DKr3.8646 at lunchtime in the US, compared with its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
Mr Schluter was only one victim of yesterday's report. The Speaker of the
Folketing, Mr HP Clausen, also resigned, while several senior civil servants
may face disciplinary action.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Iraq raid destroyed half its targets, says US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US claimed yesterday that its raid on Iraq had succeeded, although it
acknowledged that only half its targets were destroyed.
At the same time, the incoming Clinton administration warned Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein not to expect any softening of US policy.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser, said preliminary assessments
showed that the US and allied air strikes on Wednesday had hit all eight
anti-aircraft missile and radar sites in Iraq's southern no-fly zone and
destroyed about half of them. After the raid none of the Iraqi air defence
systems was in operation.
President George Bush told reporters at the White House: 'Let's just hope
that Saddam Hussein got the message. What our pilots did certainly sent that
message loud and clear.'
President-elect Bill Clinton said: 'There is no difference between my policy
and the policy of the present administration.' He added that, based on Mr
Saddam's conduct, he could imagine no circumstances in which he might
normalise relations with Iraq.
Earlier, in an interview with the New York Times, he said he was not
obsessed with the idea of ousting Mr Saddam. If the Iraqi leader wanted a
better relationship with the US, all he had to do was abide by UN
requirements.
'I always tell everybody I am a Baptist, I believe in deathbed conversions,'
Mr Clinton said.
Mr Warren Christopher, Mr Clinton's nominee as secretary of state, said this
should not be interpreted as an olive branch to Iraq. He said he was not
optimistic about Mr Saddam's prospects for redemption. At most, he said, Mr
Clinton would seek to prevent the feud from being personalised.
Mr Clinton said he would not rule out using force against Mr Saddam again in
the future, including, if necessary, re-engaging US ground troops. 'But I
want to see what he does in response to this mission,' he said.
Iraq said its radar had been switched off during the raids but was now fully
operational.
'The aim was not to give a pretext for aggression,' a military spokesman
said. 'Now, our anti-aircraft batteries . . . are prepared to confront
hostile activity.'
Iraq said its air defences had yesterday driven off two low-flying allied
aircraft patrolling in the northern no-fly zone. Mr Saddam threatened
earlier that any aircraft in Iraqi airspace would be a target.
Meanwhile, Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, said Iraq had accepted two
of the UN demands which provoked the raids.
It would stop its incursions into Kuwait near the port of Umm Qasr and would
allow UN weapons inspectors to fly to Baghdad in their own aircraft. But he
repeated that Iraq would never accept the two no-fly zones set up by the
allies.
The raids prompted some Arab criticism, led by Jordan and Egypt. They said
the western allies applied double standards when it came to the enforcement
of UN resolutions. Mr Esmat Abdel-Maguid, secretary-general of the Arab
League, said military action against Iraq was not acceptable.
'The air attack by the three western countries is a threat to the
territorial integrity of Iraq and to the safety of the Iraqi people,' he
said.
Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, dismissed Iraqi claims of civilian
casualties as 'gibberish'. Baghdad said 19 died in the air strike.
US aircraft resumed patrols of the no-fly zone yesterday to complete damage
assessments and to see if Iraqi aircraft seemed likely to retaliate.

FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI clears NatWest of misconduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank, was yesterday
cleared by a Department of Trade and Industry investigation of allegations
that it withheld important documents from a 1989 DTI inquiry into the Blue
Arrow affair.
The DTI report said there was 'no substance' to other 'allegations of
dishonesty and impropriety which have been levelled at senior officers of
NatWest'.
The report is less pleasant for the Bank of England, showing its supervisors
as being not very aggressive in probing alleged wrongdoing at a leading
bank.
Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said it was a welcome end to an episode
from which his bank had learned important lessons. He had asked for the
investigation to clear NatWest's name, after criticism of it during the 1991
Blue Arrow trial.
Mr Tom Frost, NatWest deputy chairman who had been accused of misleading the
1989 inquiry, said: 'I am glad that the record has finally been put
straight.'
Also cleared of misconduct was Wilde Sapte, the firm of solicitors which
advised NatWest during the original DTI inquiry.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Clarke's plans for police shake-up face cabinet opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL proposals by Mr Kenneth Clarke to reorganise the police look set to
be scaled back after running into strong opposition from the home
secretary's cabinet colleagues.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, have joined Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, in opposing
plans which would deprive local authorities of any real control of local
forces in England and Wales.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, has also opposed the shifting of all
police funding to Whitehall and depriving elected councils of their
majorities on local police committees. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary,
has indicated that he would not want to introduce similar arrangements north
of the border.
The proposed scheme, ending the present half-and-half arrangements for
police funding and giving the Home Office an automatic majority of
appointees on the police committees, is being characterised as the virtual
nationalisation of police forces.
Less controversially, Mr Clarke wants to reduce the number of police
authorities from 43 to as few as 25. Mr John Major was due this week to
chair a cabinet committee to examine the proposals but the meeting was
delayed because of the crises in Iraq and Bosnia.
Last night, however, Mr Clarke accused opponents of launching a pre-emptive
strike designed to force him to water down the plan. He offered assurances
that he was against the establishment of a national police force.
Mr Clarke is supported by Mr John Patten, education secretary, and Lord
Mackay, the lord chancellor. But most of his colleagues want a less
ambitious blueprint to preserve a significant role for local authorities in
overseeing and funding the police.
They are concerned that the proposals have not taken into account the
damaging impact on the overall role of elected councils. Their
responsibilities have already been significantly reduced by the government's
education reforms.
Mr Clarke, who has strong backing from colleagues for his separate drive to
reform the pay, conditions and internal management of police forces, is
expected to respond by offering proposals which transfer fewer powers to
Whitehall.

FT  15 JAN 93 / Government pledges to outlaw bugging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday pledged immediate steps to make electronic bugging
and trespass criminal offences and promised serious consideration of a civil
remedy against undue intrusion into privacy.
But it stopped short of backing the central plank of Sir David Calcutt's
report into press regulation, that the widely criticised Press Complaints
Commission should be replaced by powerful statutory tribunal.
Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, endorsed as 'compelling' the
report's findings that the self-regulatory PCC was neither effective nor
independent.
After cabinet discussions of the report yesterday, however, Mr Brooke told
the House of Commons that a statutory body would have a constitutional
significance that departed from Britain's traditional approach to press
regulation.
'In the light of these considerations, the government would be extremely
reluctant to pursue that route,' he said. The report came as two UK
newspapers, the Daily Sport and Kent Today, published the transcript of an
intimate telephone call alleged to be between Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla
Parker-Bowles. The transcript had been published in an Australian magazine
and in some Irish newspapers yesterday. The report recommended a statutory
tribunal able to fine newspapers up to 1 per cent of net annual revenue.
Such a tribunal would also be able to use injunctions to restrain newspapers
from breaching a statutory code.
It is clear the government now plans to take up the suggestion made by Sir
David in his 1990 report that criminal offences be created to prevent
intrusion, for the purpose of publication, using electronic listening
devices and long-lens cameras.
Sir David suggested fines of up to Pounds 5,000 but not prison sentences for
those found guilty. The government is also prepared to give serious
consideration to creating a tort of invasion of privacy, allowing aggrieved
parties to seek redress through civil action, and to look again at existing
legislation on data protection and interception of telephone calls.
Sir David attacked the PCC partly because it had not been set up in the way
he had outlined in his original report and because he thought it had not
done enough in celebrated cases, such as those involving the Royals.
The PCC has decided, for instance, that although there had been complaints
about the printing of topless photographs of the Duchess of York it would
not take them further as the complaints had come from third-parties not
directly involved in the story.
Sir David said his proposals, which drew wide criticism from the newspaper
industry, would enable the press to operate freely and responsibly by giving
it the backing it needed 'in a fiercely competitive market to resist the
wildest excesses'.
Downing Street said the government would draw up its plans for reform after
examining the Commons' heritage select committee's report, due next month,
and hearing newspapers' criticisms of the Calcutt report. Officials said new
legislation was unlikely to be tabled within the current parliamentary
session ending in October.
A clearer view of the government's intentions should come on January 29
during the second reading of Labour MP Clive Soley's private member's bill
to create a statutory right of reply.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Loss expected at SAS after krona
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) is set to record a loss for the third
successive year in 1992, following the devaluation of the Swedish krona
which will produce a SKr1.2bn (Dollars 162m) one-off loss.
The company declined to estimate its year-end figures, but analysts believe
the loss is likely to be around SKr700m. In the first six months of last
year, the airline recorded a SKr502m profit, but is believed to have been
held to a break-even operating result in the second-half because of
recession and intensifying competition, particularly in the Swedish market.
SAS said that during 1992 the krona fell by about 27 per cent against the
dollar and by 20 per cent against the D-Mark, helping to aggravate the
group's debt from SKr18bn to SKr25bn since the krona was floated in
November.
The currency loss might have been greater but for a strategy of switching a
portion of foreign currency debt into Swedish kronor during the last few
months of 1992, the airline noted.
SAS said the krona's devaluation would have a limited impact on its 1992
operating result.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw gains 20% in first term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based waste services and school bus operator, lifted
first-quarter earnings by 20 per cent. Profits were helped by improvements
in its hazardous waste business, lower interest costs, and a rising
contribution from 28 per cent-owned ADT, the security and vehicle auction
group.
Laidlaw said yesterday that relations between the Canadian company and ADT
had improved. ADT has complied with the bulk of the demands made by Laidlaw
following an acrimonious dispute between the two companies in 1991.
These include a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, quarterly reporting
and greater representation on ADT's board. The Bermuda-based company is
considering using US accounting principles in its financial reports.
Laidlaw's earnings rose to USDollars 48.9m, or 18 cents a share, in the
three months to November 30, from USDollars 40.6m, or 16 cents a year
earlier. Revenues dropped by 2 per cent to USDollars 513m, mainly because of
a decline in the Canadian dollar.
Equity earnings from ADT and 35 per cent-owned Attwoods, the UK-based waste
management group, rose to USDollars 11m from USDollars 8.4m. Laidlaw did not
specify the contribution of each company, but said the increase came
primarily from ADT.
Operating income from hazardous waste rose to USDollars 19.3m from USDollars
15.3m, thanks to the first improvement in volumes and prices in several
quarters. But income and margins in the solid waste and school bus
operations continued to slide.
Laidlaw is restructuring its solid waste operations in the US and Canada.
Two businesses have been sold in the past year and further disposals are
expected.

SHARES IN Acorn Computers, the Cambridge-based workstation manufacturer in
which Olivetti of Italy has a majority stake, have risen by about 40 per
cent in the past few days.
Throughout December, the price hovered around the 40p mark; yesterday it
closed at 56p, having soared over 70p earlier in the week.
The likely cause is news that a microprocessor chip developed by a
subsidiary is to be used for a series of new US consumer electronics
products.
Acorn issued a statement yesterday denying knowledge of any factors which
could have caused the share price movement.
Mr Sam Wauchope, Acorn managing director, said there was nothing beneath the
surface which had not been made public.
Acorn, which made its reputation in the UK supplying computers to schools,
holds a 49 per cent stake in Advanced Risc Machines, a semiconductor design
house.
The other partners are Apple Computers, one of the largest personal computer
manufacturers, and VLSI Technology, a US semiconductor manufacturer.
ARM has designed a family of powerful, but low-cost, microprocessors for use
in hand-held computers, smart cards and consumer electronic products.
Last year it was announced that ARM chips would be used in the Apple
'Newton', a personal electronic assistant functioning as diary, address book
and organiser, which will accept handwritten instructions.
This news coincided with the beginning of a rise in Acorn's share price  -
from 6p to 40p - over six months.
This week's rise coincides with the news that an ARM chip will be used in a
revolutionary video graphics and video games machine announced in the US by
3DO Company.
A later version of 3DO's 'interactive multiplayer' will play music CDs and
photo CDs.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Extra time for British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HESELTINE goes to Brussels today to see whether the EC's policy on aid to
industry can accommodate a fresh round of subsidies to save British Coal. If
he steps on the plane with a heavy heart, he has only himself to blame since
his own mishandling of the pit closures is the main reason why he is now
trying to prop up British Coal rather than privatise it.
But a commercially viable coal industry must remain his aim. Although the
stormy debate over the future of coal has shown that there is widespread
popular support for the industry, it has not thrown up any compelling reason
to accord it special treatment. The UK is a fuel-rich country which does not
need to rely heavily on coal. Coal is an expensive fuel once its true
environmental costs are factored in - as they should be. And British Coal
has already demonstrated that it possesses the technology and the will to
raise its productivity closer to commercial levels.
The only possible case for extending subsidies lies in the evidence
submitted by independent mining engineers that British Coal could achieve
greater viability with three or four more years' breathing space. Even this
is another of those gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow arguments which needs to
treated with caution, but given the hard political realities now facing Mr
Heseltine, it might provide the least harmful possible justification for
further aid.
However if the UK does embark on a fresh round of subsidy it needs to be
done with several clear points in mind.
The first is that any aid for British Coal will be driven more by a desire
to save jobs than to bring sense to the UK's energy policy. The funds should
therefore be accounted for as an employment subsidy and not as a hand-out to
the coal industry. That will not, regrettably, avoid the fact of further
distorting the UK's already badly warped energy picture, and these will load
further costs on to the economy at large through higher-than-necessary
electricity prices. It will have a knock-on effect on other industries such
as gas and nuclear power, and place a competitive handicap on British
manufacturers.
The second is that protection for coal will also lead to higher electricity
prices because of regulatory arrangements which permit power generation
costs to be passed directly through to the consumer. Since concerns already
exist about the lack of competition in the generating business it would be
appropriate to combine any programme of subsidies with closer monopoly
scrutiny of the power business.
A third is that the cost of any subsidy should be clearly identified. Since
helping coal is essentially a matter of social policy, the cost should
logically be borne by the taxpayer. But with the Budget in deep deficit this
would mean up to 1p on income tax - a tricky option in present
circumstances. Therefore the cost may well have to be borne by the consumer
through a levy on electricity bills, which is not as it should be, though it
does have the advantage that people could be reminded by an item on their
quarterly statements of just how much it is costing them to keep British
Coal going.
A fourth point is that Mr Heseltine's package of measures should be
accompanied by a clear timetable for privatising and restructuring British
Coal, partly in order to make announced limits on both the size and ultimate
duration of subsidies more credible. There is no reason, as the government
now appears to believe, why British Coal should not be privatised during the
lifetime of a subsidy regime. Its new owners would know the score and would
have a stronger incentive to get British Coal into shape for the day when
they cease.
Although many people will judge the success of Mr Heseltine's task in terms
of the number of miners' jobs he saves, a better measure will be the bottom
line in terms of money spent. The less the better. Extra time for British
Coal in the end only means extra money.

REGIONAL electricity chiefs say they are close to successfully concluding
with generators the heads-of-agreement negotiations that will underpin
long-term contracts to buy British coal.
Some believe they can complete the talks by the end of next week, although
they say nothing is likely to be signed before the government publishes its
white paper on energy, probably next month.
Rumours about the progress of the talks helped to raise the price of most
electricity shares yesterday, particularly National Power and PowerGen, the
generators.
The heads-of-agreement talks are being held between 11 of the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs) of England and Wales and each of the two
generators.
They will provide the basis for the bilateral agreements between regional
companies and generators by which the Recs will buy electricity generated
from British coal.
Although the heads of agreement are fairly detailed, covering such issues as
risk-sharing in the event of unforeseen circumstances, they would leave
individual companies to negotiate price and volumes.
Tariffs for electricity supply, based on the contract prices, are due to be
in place from the beginning of April and the companies would aim to publish
them a month earlier.
The talks assume that deals will last five years in spite of suggestions by
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that a one-year deal
might be preferable.
Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern Electric, said the heads-of-agreement
talks would help to clear the air for bilateral talks. The regional
companies would want any deals cleared by Offer, the regulator, before
signing them.
National Power said progress had been made in the talks but it was too early
to say when they could be concluded.
Evidence from 327 individuals and organisations had been received at the end
of last week by the Department of Trade and Industry as part of its coal
review, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister said yesterday.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Ministers to seek early coal industry sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to push for early privatisation of the coal industry in
spite of the furore over the pit closure programme. Ministers intend to
start work on firm proposals as soon as they put in place the package for
saving some of the 31 pits earmarked for closure last October.
They have concluded that putting British Coal into the private sector is the
best way of ensuring that subsidies to the industry, now seen as an
inevitable part of the package, are ended by the late 1990s.
Legislation on privatisation is likely for the parliamentary session
beginning in the autumn of this year, or the following session at the
latest. Previously, ministers had suggested that the crisis over pit
closures could force a more significant postponement of privatisation, at
least until it could be made commercially viable.
They now believe there is no reason why British Coal should not be
privatised while it still receives subsidies, provided there is a clear
schedule to phase them out.
Ministers are likely to justify the policy stance as putting pressure on
British Coal to improve its performance, and emphasising that the long-term
objective of moving the company into the private sector remains unchanged.
The subsidies, to be collected either from the taxpayer, or, more likely,
through levies on electricity bills, would be aimed largely at enabling
British Coal to replace some of the 20m tonnes of coal imports which come
into the UK each year.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will be in Brussels
today to brief European Commission officials on his plans, and ensure that
proposed subsidies for British Coal fit in with EC policies on competition
and on aid to industry.
While still considering a range of ideas to increase British Coal sales to
electricity generators from the proposed level of 40m tonnes in 1993-94 and
30m tonnes in the following four years, the government is moving away from
the idea of closing Magnox nuclear stations which are nearing the end of
their lives. It believes such a move would be too expensive, partly because
of the decommissioning costs, and because relatively few pits or jobs would
be saved, especially as nuclear jobs would then be cut.
Ministers are also unenthusiastic about setting up an energy commission to
supervise the electricity and gas industries, and want to keep the existing
system of regulators for each industry.
But they think that the government might be able to play a larger role in
shaping the industry by supplying information or setting priorities, such as
encouraging renewable forms of energy.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Berlusconi confirms interest in
GS
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate whose privately-owned
Fininvest holding company also controls the listed Standa retailing group,
yesterday confirmed his interest in buying GS, the supermarkets chain owned
by the state-owned SME foods, catering and retailing concern.
SME is being split up before disposal as part of the government's
privatisation drive. However, the fate of its retailing activities remains
unclear amid signs that IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which
controls SME, would like to retain significant roles in retailing and
catering.
GS accounted for almost 40 per cent of SME's total group sales of L5,814bn
(Dollars 3.9bn) in 1991. Apart from GS supermarkets, the unit includes a
rising number of out-of-town hypermarkets, which are one of the
fastest-growing areas of Italian retailing.
Mr Berlusconi bought Standa in 1988 from the Montedison chemicals group. The
company, which is Italy's biggest retailing concern, made net profits of
L31bn on sales of L4,028bn in 1991.
Although earnings have improved substantially in recent years, Standa
continues to suffer from a downmarket image and an unfocused range. However,
its Euromercato hypermarkets subsidiary has shown sharp growth following
heavy investment in new outlets.
Mr Berlusconi said Standa's 1992 sales, not due to be released until later
this year, improved by 10 per cent last year, coming in 'some L30bn over
budget'.
Mr Berlusconi also said that Mondadori, Italy's biggest publishing and
magazines group, should show sales of L1,600bn last year, against L1,460bn
in 1991. Mr Berlusconi confirmed the group, which was subjected to a
bruising battle for control between himself and Mr Carlo De Benedetti before
being divided in 1991, was now in sound financial shape.

RANK XEROX, the office equipment group, is to set up a European research
centre in the French Alpine town of Grenoble.
The centre will open in April with an annual budget of Ecu15m (Dollars
18.45m), to carry out research into electronic handling of documents in
different languages, including computer-assisted translation. It will have
control over Rank Xerox's research centres in Cambridge and employ 50
people, rising to 150 by 1996.
This is the latest in a string of international research bodies to set up in
Grenoble, France's biggest research centre outside Paris. Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, said Grenoble was beginning to benefit from
a 'snowball effect' of investment in high technology and his government was
eager to attract research projects.
Grenoble groups 250 private and public sector laboratories and five European
research facilities, a big factor in Rank Xerox's choice of the site against
alternatives in Italy, Spain, Germany and elsewhere in France, said Mr
Bernard Fournier, managing director of Rank Xerox.
Various forms of French public aid cover 10 per cent of the first two years'
costs, about the same as was on offer from rival sites.
The aim is to develop products that will reduce the 8 per cent of spending
which the average company spends on compiling and handling documents, said
Mr Fournier.
Eastman Kodak, Sony and Hitachi have agreed on a standard for a video print
pack for thermal dye transfer printers to be used in the home, Reuter
reports.
The printers can produce colour prints from video and digital sources, such
as video cameras and electronic still cameras. The companies said current
thermal dye transfer printers are used mainly for business and commerce, and
print paper and cartridges differ with each manufacturer.

A CONSORTIUM of Davy International of the UK and Shearson Lehman Brothers of
the US have been awarded a contract by Rosario Dominicana, the Dominican
Republic's state-owned gold miner, for a refractory gold ore treatment
plant, according to government officials in the Dominican Republic.
The officials said, however, that Rosario Dominicana and Davy International
are yet to agree aspects of the contract, which will be determined by
further feasibility studies and the raising of the funds, expected to be
between Dollars 200m and Dollars 250m, for the project.
'Negotiations are still to be concluded, and when these are finished
President Joaquin Balaguer will make a public announcement on the awarding
of the contract,' said one official.
Davy International and two other companies, Minproc Engineering of
Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil, were shortlisted by
Rosario Dominicana after submitting bids for the project.
A statement by Davy International, a member of the engineering division of
Trafalgar House, said the project involved the conversion of Rosario
Dominicana's existing 10,000 tonnes-a-day oxide and transitional ore mill to
treat between 10,000 and 15,000 tonnes-a-day of refractory (difficult to
treat) gold ore.
The contract involves a study to identifiy the optimum ore throughput and
the preparation of a 'bankable feasibility study on the chosen option'.
Shearson Lehman Brothers will be responsible for raising the money for the
project.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alcoa declines 30% to Dollars

<TEXT>
ALCOA, the world's biggest aluminium company, saw net income before charges
fall by nearly 30 per cent last year to Dollars 196.3m, or Dollars 2.27m a
share, from Dollars 279.7m, or Dollars 3.27m.
After charges, mainly associated with the new US accounting standards, there
was a net loss of Dollars 1.14bn, or Dollars 13.41, for 1992, against net
earnings of Dollars 62.7m, or 71 cents.
Alcoa last year reduced working capital and lowered costs which offset a
significant proportion of revenue lost from low aluminium prices. However,
the results were at the lower end of analysts expectations.
Mr Tom Van Leeuwen, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'This was a little
disappointing, but not overwhelmingly disappointing.' He said Alcoa 'faces a
very difficult earnings environment in 1993. The downside is limited but
there is no upside at all'.
Alcoa shipped 2.797m tonnes of aluminium last year, against 2.836m tonnes in
1991.
In the fourth quarter earnings before charges were Dollars 49m or 50 cents
compared with Dollars 25.5m or 30 cents in the same quarter of 1991. There
was a loss after charges of Dollars 80m or 94 cents compared with a loss of
Dollars 191.4m or Dollars 2.26.
Alcoa restated its results for the first three quarters of 1992 in the light
of its implementation of Financial Accounting Standard proposals and in the
first quarter of 1992 took a one-time, non-cash net charge of Dollars 1.11bn
or Dollars 13.06 a share in respect of these accounting changes.
Alcoa of Australia, the Australian aluminium and gold producer, blamed lower
metal prices for a 32 per cent reduction in net profit to ADollars 259m
(USDollars 178.6m) for the year to the end of December. Sales revenue fell
13.1 per cent to ADollars 2.2bn, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Alcoa, which is 48.25 per cent owned by Western Mining Corporation and 51
per cent by Alcoa of the US, said fourth-quarter profits fell to ADollars
55.3m from ADollars 77.8m, in spite of improved productivity and a lower
Australian dollar exchange rate.

Correction (Published 15th January 1993) appended to this article
THE GROWTH in power and influence of quangos puts responsibility for many of
the UK's public services in the hands of the unelected members of their
boards.
Since 1979 there have been numerous accusations that the Conservatives have
used patronage to appoint Tory supporters to key quango jobs, particularly
in health services.
In the latest row Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, this week accused
the government of 'deliberately stuffing public bodies and authorities (in
Wales) with Tory placemen'. That follows the appointment last year of former
Tory MP Mr Ian Grist - who lost Cardiff Central in the general election - as
chairman of South Glamorgan health authority.
Analysis by the the Financial Times of the chairmen of the 10 largest NHS
quangos and the 30 largest non-NHS quangos in 1990-91 shows that, if they
had an identifiable political affiliation, it was Conservative. None of the
top 40 was a known Labour party member or Liberal Democrat, while eight were
Conservatives.
Among prominent Tories is the former Mr Nicholas Edwards, now Lord
Crickhowell, a former Welsh secretary. He now chairs the National Rivers
Authority; and Mr David Mitchell of Cumbernauld Development Corporation, who
is treasurer of the Scottish Conservative party. Sir Bryan Askew, who chairs
Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, was a Conservative parliamentary
candidate.
The last Labour government also used its patronage powers to appoint
supporters to key posts in top quangos. Twelve of the top 40 chairmen in
1978-79 were Labour supporters, including Labour peers Lord Northfield and
Lord Campbell. Supporters of other political parties also chaired top
quangos. Three were known Conservatives and one a Liberal.
There have been other changes in the type of people running top quangos in
the 14 years since the Conservatives came to power. The most striking is the
move away from appointing professional public-sector managers.
Today's top quango chairman is much more likely to be a businessman - nearly
two thirds of the chairmen of top 40 quangos in 1990-91 were from business
and industry. It was one third in 1978-79.
Some of those businessmen have headed large public companies. Sir Alistair
Grant, chairman and chief executive of Argyll Group, is chairman of the
Agricultural and Food Research Council. Sir David Nickson of Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries, Sir David Plastow of Vickers and Sir Clifford Chetwood
of George Wimpey also chair top 40 quangos.
Others come from smaller businesses or have not headed their own company
boards. Sir James Ackers, who last week resigned as chairman of West
Midlands regional health authority, the biggest-spending NHS quango, ran a
family truck-rental business which collapsed last year. Sir Bryan Askew is
personnel director for brewers Samuel Smiths.
The appointment of more businessmen has been matched by a fall in the number
of chairmen who come from the 'great and the good'. In 1978-79, nine of the
top 40 quangos were chaired by someone whose main occupation was serving on
public bodies. Only two fell into that category in 1990-91, Baroness
Cumberlege of the South West Thames RHA - who has since become a minister -
and Mr John McEvoy, who chairs the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
The FT study also shows that the top 40 quango chairmen in 1990-91 were not
representative of the people for whom they provided public services. They
were overwhelmingly male, with only two women among the top 40.
Of the 22 whose schools could be identified, 18 went to public schools. They
were mostly university-educated, eight at Oxford or Cambridge.
If there is a new elite running Britain's public services, as the European
Policy Foundation alleges, it appears the best qualifications to join are to
be a businessman with Conservative leanings.

The largest quangos are dominated by health service bodies. The regional and
district health authorities in England and Wales, the Scottish health boards
and the Northern Ireland health and social services boards make up more than
half the 40 biggest spenders among public bodies.
To make a representative selection of the different fields covered by
quangos the FT top 40 combines the 10 largest national health service bodies
and the 30 largest non-NHS bodies.
The key appointment in most quangos is often the chairman. He or she is
usually the most influential board member in determining policy and
appointing top executives. The chairman may also be consulted on the
appointment of the rest of the board and may act as a policy adviser to the
minister whose department is responsible for the quango.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Insurers wary of new retail regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry's support for the Personal Investments Authority, the
proposed regulator of retail financial businesses, has been undermined by a
call for it to set out tougher rules for members, the Association of British
Insurers said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has told
the authority's Formation Committee that it must prove it will bring about a
radical improvement in regulation. The PIA is intended to be formed by the
merger of two self-regulatory organisations - Lautro for unit trust and life
companies, and Fimbra for financial intermediaries. It is intended to be the
lead regulator for firms selling life, pensions and unit trust products.
Mr Large has insisted the PIA's proposed 30-member board be cut to 15, with
a majority of 'public interest' representatives, including consumer
representatives and individuals from outside the financial industry.
He has also said that regulated businesses must be prepared to pay higher
fees to cover tougher regulation and that sales agents and independent
advisers would have to show fitness, properness and adequacy of capital
resources before being allowed to join.
The insurers' association, whose support is crucial to the PIA's success, is
objecting to the suggestion that the board be dominated by public-interest
directors.
Mr Mike Jones, its chief executive, said: 'This looks like a big step down
the road away from practitioner-based self-regulation and not what was
intended under the Financial Services Act.'
Mr Large's letter is said to have been privately welcomed by the banking
industry. The banks' financial services businesses are regulated directly by
the Securities and Investments Board and they have expressed no interest in
switching to the PIA.
One banker said the SIB's conditions for the new body might 'lead to fewer
claims on the investors compensation scheme'. The letter also indicates that
the banks will be regulated under rules formulated by the PIA, a move
calculated to encourage them to join the PIA.
The SIB said yesterday it proposed to charge members of Imro, the
self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, an additional Pounds
350,000 for the 1992-93 fiscal year to cover increased expenditure after the
Maxwell affair.
The estimated fees from members in 1992-93 is Pounds 17.92m, up from Pounds
17.79m in 1991-92.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Brazil's leader begins shake-upof privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco has taken control of privatisation away
from the National Development Bank (BNDES) in the first step of a shake-up
of the programme. The news hit shares on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, which
fell 5.2 per cent in response.
The privatisation programme, begun in 1991 by former President Fernando
Collor, has always been run by the Rio-based BNDES. However, Mr Franco, a
past critic, apparently wants more influence over the programme, which he
suspended on December 15 but has promised to restart in March after a
thorough review.
Mr Franco had been expected last night to sign an extensive decree altering
the programme's rules and changing the composition of the privatisation
commission. However, after an hour-long meeting with Mr Paulo Haddad,
planning minister, and Mr Jose de Castro, his chief adviser on
privatisation, he walked out casting doubt over the signing of the decree.
Mr Antonio Barros de Castro, the recently appointed BNDES president, is
known to have annoyed Mr Franco by recommending last week that the previous
rules be maintained for the sale of 35 companies slated for privatisation.
Mr Jose de Castro yesterday dismissed investor fears that the programme
would not be restarted and insisted the next sale would go ahead on March 10
but under new rules.
The decree prepared by Mr Haddad and Mr Jose de Castro is expected to leave
to presidential discretion on a case-by-case basis the issue of a minimum
cash participation in the sales. Until now most of the Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) raised through privatisation has taken the form of domestic debt.
According to Mr Jose de Castro the objective of the new rules is 'to
guarantee more transparency and legal security. All sell-offs done so far
have been sub judice because of badly elaborated decrees and unclear
regulations'.

TWO GERMAN subsidiaries of GEC Alsthom, EVT and MAN Energie, have won orders
totalling DM575m (Pounds 237m) to design and supply equipment for a planned
extension to a power station near Nuremberg in Bavaria.
The orders are from Grosskraftwerk Franken for its Franken II power station
at Frauenaurach. The coal/gas fired extension is planned to meet the
expected increased demand for electricity in the industrial region of
Nuremberg in the second half of the 1990s.
EVT will supply a low-emission steam generator and waste heat recovery
boiler, while MAN Energie will supply a 605MW steam turbine.

FT  14 JAN 93 / EC's chemical industry faces a difficult year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S chemical industry faces a tough year, with production growth rates
slowing, exports falling and companies unable to push through meaningful
prices rises.
The European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) warned yesterday that profit
improvements would only be generated through cost cutting, particularly
labour.
Employment in the chemical industry, which fell 1.4 per cent last year, is
set to drop a further 1.5 per cent over the next 12 months, it predicted in
its annual forecast. Cefic estimates 2.1m people are directly employed by
the industry in Europe.
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist of Imperial Chemical Industries, as well
as chairman of Cefic's economic appraisal committee, said output of
chemicals had been surprisingly strong last year, growing at 2 per cent.
But the large additions to capacity, particularly in Belgium, the
Netherlands, Spain and France, had led to a significant build-up of stocks.
These were still rising from relatively high levels.
The weakening economies of west Germany, France and Spain would provide
little to help the industry. Cefic estimated that West European GDP would
grow at only 1 per cent this year. The outlook for manufacturing output of
all European industry was bleak, and would fall 0.2 per cent by volume
during 1993, said Mr Freeman. West German manufacturing output would fall 2
per cent over the same period, he added. Demand for chemicals would rise
only 0.9 per cent next year.
Prospects for the chemical industry were not promising, said Mr Freeman. In
Europe, the US and Japan, chemical production was flat or on a downward
trend.
US chemical production is set to fall from 5 per cent last year to 4.6 per
cent over the next 12 months, although Mr Freeman said this would require a
marked improvement in conditions over the next few months. Japanese
production was static last year but will increase 1 per cent this year.
West European chemical production increased 2.2 per cent in 1992, but will
fall to only 1 per cent this year. West German production will be static,
while production should grow at 2.1 per cent in France, 0.4 per cent in
Italy, 1.5 per cent in the UK, 4 per cent in Belgium, and 2.5 per cent in
the Netherlands. Spain's production will fall 1 per cent.
All chemical sectors will experience a decline in the rate of growth in
production apart from fertilisers and inorganics, according to the forecast.
Even pharmaceuticals will slow, mainly because of government measures
against drugs prices in Germany and Italy. Sales are expected to rise only 1
per cent in Germany, and will fall 2 per cent in Italy.
Europe's chemical industry will be unable to export its way out of trouble.
Growth in exports is expected to decline sharply from 4.1 per cent last year
to only 2.5 per cent.
Prices are likely to be flat in much of Europe, with no rises in west
Germany, France and the Netherlands. In the UK and Italy they are expected
to rise 3 per cent following devaluations last year. Prices should rise 2
per cent in Belgium, but fall 0.5 per cent in Spain.
Employment will fall as chemical groups attempt to control costs. In West
Germany and France employment in the chemical industry will fall 1 per cent.
In Italy it will drop 1.7 per cent, in the UK 3.3 per cent, the Netherlands
1.9 per cent and Spain 0.2 per cent. In Belgium, it should remain static.
Investment in the industry, which fell 4.9 per cent last year to about
Ecu22bn (Pounds 17.8bn), is expected to fall another 3 per cent this year.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Judge revokes Santander order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTIGATING judge at Spain's senior monetary court yesterday revoked an
order that had forced Banco Santander to post a Pta8bn (Dollars 70.7m) bond
as surety against possible fraud charges.
Judge Miguel Moreiras, who ordered the bond on December 23, upheld an appeal
issued by the bank against the surety but said he would continue
investigating an alleged tax avoidance instrument promoted by Santander
between 1986 and 1989 called loan assignments. A key element in Santander's
appeal had been that the bank could not be investigated over any possible
irregularities, and much less post a bond, unless prior charges had been
brought against persons who by using the bank's services had sought to avoid
taxes.
The bank had claimed that the loans assignments were not bound by normal
fiscal guidelines on deposits until a government decree specifically made
them so in July 1989.
Judge Moreiras said he had asked the internal revenue service of the Finance
Ministry to define what tributary responsibilities might have been incurred
by Santander's customers when they contracted loan assignments with the
bank. Since more than 45,000 such assignments took place in the three-year
period, the task facing the tax authorities appears to be a lengthy one.
Santander said the judge's request to the Finance Ministry was reasonable
and the bank expressed its willingness to collaborate in clarifying this
matter.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: ABN Amro may withdraw Breevast
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

<TEXT>
ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' largest bank, will not proceed with a proposed
tender offer worth up to Fl 105.6m (Dollars 57.7m) for Breevast, a Dutch
property investment company, unless the Finance Ministry lifts a claim
lodged against Breevast, writes Ronald van de Krol.
In mid-December, ABN AMRO, which owns a 21 per cent stake in Breevast, said
it expected to launch a tender offer of between Fl 15 and Fl 16 for the
outstanding 6.6m shares it does not own. But the companies said yesterday
Breevast was presented with an unspecified financial claim by the ministry
in late December.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's environmental adviser yesterday attacked the
government for approving a plan to resume building atomic power stations.
The Russian cabinet adopted at the end of last month the plan to build two
new VVR-1000 reactors and one Chernobyl-style RMBK reactor by 1995. Prof
Alexei Yablokov, Mr Yeltsin's adviser and a leading environmental
campaigner, said he fought against the decision.
'I spoke desperately at the meeting but my remarks were ignored and it is
tragic that even the ecology minister did not support me.'
Prof Yablokov also accused the west of hypocrisy in offering to help with
Russia's nuclear problems. The west was offering technical assistance and
cash for Russia to build new plants and overhaul existing ones. But it would
be safer and cheaper to help idle Russian defence plants convert to the
production of gas turbines, Prof Yablokov said.
An atomic energy ministry spokesman said Russia could not afford the gas
turbines option for now. The government decision had ended official
indecision over nuclear power since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, he added.
Prof Yablokov's remarks coincided with a fire yesterday at the Chernobyl
nuclear reactor in Ukraine. Plant officials said there was no danger to
public health in the latest of a series of incidents at power plants around
the former Soviet Union. Officials said the fire was quickly extinguished
and no radiation was released.

The Czech government says it does not intend to reintroduce price controls
despite a public outcry against sharp increases on basic foods following the
introduction of value-added tax on January 1, writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
However, it plans a rise of 13.5 per cent in the minimum wage and an
increase of 20 per cent in housing subsidies for the needy.
Mr Ivan Kocarnik, the finance minister, said it was too early to assess the
full impact of VAT on prices, and that there were signs prices were already
coming down after the initial rises.

The move follows parliamentary approval for the decision - by 33 votes to 23

Iceland, which is a member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta)
joins Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria in seeking to join the EEA, a
trade pact grouping EC and Efta countries. It is not seeking to join the EC,
partly because of worries over fishing policy.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Germany losing investor appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is losing its attraction as a location for foreign investors because
of high wages and corporate taxation, short working hours and strict
environmental regulations, writes Quentin Peel.
Between 1986 and 1991 foreign investment in Germany totalled just DM20bn
(Pounds 8.20bn), whereas German investment abroad reached almost DM130bn,
according to the Institute for the German economy (DIW) in Cologne.
The survey of foreign subsidiaries operating in the country showed that in
spite of the disadvantages, almost 70 per cent expected to maintain or even
increase the level of their investment in Germany.
The main motives for foreign investors appear to be proximity to their
(German) market and an ability to look after existing customers and open new
markets.

FT  14 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gencos up on coal deal hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN the two main power generators surged as rumours returned that the
new contract to supply the regional electricity companies had been signed.
The deal is due to be tied up by April but the present government
predicament over the fate of the UK mining industry has added spice to the
terms of the contract, and how it will affect the generators' shares.
Before recent government hints that a subsidy may be given to coal
production, some energy specialists were pred-icting that PowerGen and
National Power would be able to provide about a 20 per cent dividend boost
from the improved earnings growth this year. While some still hold this
view, analysts are increasingly fearful that a subsidy on coal would not
only limit earnings, but also add weight to the regulatory environment -
with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission referral not ruled out - which in
turn could impinge on profits.
Yesterday the mood was more positive on the likely outcome; PowerGen
advanced 8 1/2 to 289p and National Power 8 to 289p. The regional companies
were also generally strong, with Manweb, ahead 13 at 506p, Norweb, up 12 at
489p, and Seeboard, 8 higher at 472p, among the main movers.
Enterprise weakens
The after-effects of a US listing by Enterprise Oil was said to be behind a
sharp fall in the UK share price yesterday. The independent exploration and
production company attempted to raise Dollars 150m (Pounds 98.6m) through an
initial public offering of American Depositary Shares in October.
A large chunk of the shares, however, were left with the underwriters, who
needed to offload them in the UK. Dealers said the stock was now overhanging
the market and responsible for the under-lying share price sliding 14 to
409p. Others suggested that the shares might merely have been consolidating
following a good run.
Courtaulds switch
Chemicals group Courtaulds tumbled 14 1/2 to 572 1/2 p after US investment
bank Lehman Brothers recommended switching out of the stock and into
Laporte, which rose 7 to 602p ex-rights.
Lehman analyst Mr Martin Glen argued that Laporte's price/earnings ratio was
some two points lower than Courtaulds' and it was more exposed to economic
recovery in North America. Also, Laporte was higher yielding and had greater
earnings growth potential. Laporte was supported by a number of other
houses, including Hoare Govett, which argues that the company's offer last
week for Evode (steady at 123p) was 'shrewd and well timed'.
Drug issues bought
Pharmaceuticals stocks held against the trend as one leading securities
house decided the tide was about to turn and became a strong buyer. The
sector was marginally up on the day and leading issues resisted selling
pressure.
Hoare Govett published an in-depth note entitled 'Calling the Bottom', which
argued that the sector presented a strong buying opportunity. Analyst Mr
Nigel Barnes said the sector could drift more in the short term but on a
12-month view it was 'extremely cheap'.
The house particularly likes SmithKline Beecham and said an R &amp; D
presentation in Philadelphia in March will highlight new products. It is
also buying Glaxo, Amersham International and London International.
SmithKline firmed 2 to 477p and 418p in the Units. Glaxo was a penny higher
at 724p, Amersham firm at 653p and LIG steady at 256p.
Dixons disappoints
The downward march in Dixons shares continued as the stores group revealed a
decline in its US fortunes far worse than the market's expectations. While
UK sales had held up well, particularly in the Christmas period, Dixons' US
electrical retailing chain Silo produced further losses and deepening gloom
among analysts. Dixons dropped 29 to 225p on exceptionally heavy turnover of
12m, the highest for around two years.
However, there were signs yesterday that the shares may soon find some
support. Mr Andy Hughes, stores specialist at Nomura, moved from a sell to a
buy, arguing that the fall had been overdone - the shares stood at 280p a
week ago - and that they now looked good value. 'Dixons is well placed for
recovery and the UK sales picture is very encouraging.' He added that the
revival in the US economy should come to the aid of Silo.
Bears of the stock forecast further falls. Mr Tony Shiret at BZW predicted
even worse losses in the US this year, despite Dixons' attempts to stem the
tide with a series of store closures. 'The shares are still too highly
rated,' he said.
There were other gloomy reports around the stores sector yesterday. The
well-signalled trading statement from Alexon proved this week's bear raiders
correct and the shares reacted accordingly, falling 8 to 68p. Warning of
flat earnings, the group said it did 'not anticipate recommending a final
dividend'.
Body Shop said UK sales in the pre-Christmas period were down 8 per cent.
The shares weakened 15 to 153p. Profits forecasts were pulled in to a range
of Pounds 19m to 22m, down about 10 per cent.
Rumours of downgradings in Great Universal Stores were heard. The shares
have fallen around a pound in the last week, including 37 yesterday to close
at 1613p. DIY worries and the continuing uncertainty over the strength of
the recovery knocked Kingfisher, off 18 at 554p. However, Next again
responded to talk that its sales remain firm, the shares adding 1 1/2 at
154p.
Oil shares were lower in the face of continued weakness in the oil price.
Spot and January Brent crude dipped below Dollars 17 per barrel, leading
some analysts to cut price forecasts for the year. BZW analyst Mr Jeremy
Elden cut his 1993 oil price forecast to Dollars 19.5 per barrel from
Dollars 21, but said investors should buy oil shares if Opec delivers
production cuts.
Shell Transport touched 524p but closed only a penny off at 529p, while
Lasmo dipped 4 to 146p. British Petroleum was steady at 237 1/2 p, although
Morgan Stanley was last night contacting clients to say it had cut
fourth-quarter earnings estimates. Analyst Mr Lars Reierson lowered his
forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 95m and said: 'US buying has been based on
over-optimistic earnings estimates. There will be little fundamental support
in the UK for the shares until the yield is a lot closer to Shell's'
Vodafone declined 9 to 399p on talk of regulatory interest in the cellular
market. Hoare Govett turned seller of the stock, citing aggressive
competition from Cellnet. Hoare also downgraded BT, the fully-paid losing 4
at 386p, and Cable and Wireless, 15 adrift at 692p, blaming UK recessionary
effects.
Firm results from First Leisure sent the shares forward 7 to 327p.
Championship prospects again lifted Manchester United, up 18 at 367p.
Bid speculation continued to circulate around Lucas Industries, driving the
shares forward 5 to 149p in trade of 3.2m. The Lucas warrants were also
actively traded. Volume jumped to 2.3m as they hardened 2 1/2 to 17 1/2 p.
Aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce had a busy day. The shares fell 5 1/2
early in the session after Smith New Court cut dividend expectations for the
year to December 1992 by 2 1/2 p to 5p. Smith blamed the reduction on a lack
of pick-up in the spares business, technical factors, and the weak aircraft
market due to cancellations. Bargain hunters helped the stock recover to
close just 2 off at 106p on 6.3m traded.
Investors appreciated GKN's confirmation of plans for a new US plant and the
shares firmed 5 to 465p.
Public relations firm Shandwick performed well in percentage terms, rising 1
1/2 to 15 1/2 p ahead of results on January 26. Shandwick is well geared for
recovery in the US as it generates 50 per cent of profits there.
Talk of a Cazenove downgrade left Northern Foods 8 cheaper at 270p. James
Capel was said to be a buyer of Hillsdown, 8 higher at 143p.

FT  14 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Middle East tensions unsettle
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITY market's con-cern about fund-raising via rights issues, the
siphoning of cash into the gilt-edged market and worries about the UK Budget
remained ever-present but played second fiddle yesterday in a market
obsessed by the possibility of further conflict in the Middle East.
News late in the session that President Bush had sanctioned an air strike
against Iraq and that allied aircraft were about to attack Iraqi
installations swept through the City's dealing rooms, triggering a fresh
decline in an already weak equity market. Official reports of the allied
strike came after the market had closed.
At the finish the FT-SE 100 Index posted a 12.6 loss at 2,745.3, its seventh
successive decline. Since reaching a record 2,861.5 on January 4, the first
working day of the new year, the market has fallen 116.2 points, or 4.1 per
cent.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, however, which substantially outperformed the 100
Index during the last quarter of 1992 and up until last week, was much
steadier, ending only 2.8 easier at 2,876.3.
Dealers spoke of a much higher concentration of buying interest in the
second-tier stocks compared with that in the FT-SE 100 constituents, a view
borne out by the breakdown of yesterday's market turnover figures. Overall
volume was a relatively high 652.7m shares, with activity in non-Footsie
stocks accounting for business of 432.3m shares. Footsie turnover totalled
220.4m shares.
Dealers made a bold attempt to get the equity market moving ahead at the
start of trading, taking the view that the straight-line fall in excess of
100 Footsie points more than accounted for the spate of gloomy news in
recent sessions.
'The institutions were definitely nibbling this morning, but only until
lunchtime, when the future started to come under pressure,' said a leading
trader at one of the top UK securities houses. He added that the market's
growing apprehension about the possibility of military conflict in Iraq
unnerved fund managers.
But a general view in the market was that further military action in the
Middle East would be short-lived.
The Footsie future continued to play a big role in determining the course of
the cash market. 'The future was under pressure all afternoon and being
constantly tested on the downside,' one dealer said.
Having risen more than 10 points during the first hour of trading, the
Footsie began to falter and moved into negative territory around midday. The
build-up of selling pressure reached its height in mid-afternoon, with the
index down 17.2 at 2,740.7 before its late rally. Wall Street, some 20
points weaker at the opening, was staging a minor rally as London closed.
The retail sector, which outperformed the wider market immediately before
and after the Christmas period, suffered another setback after disappointing
trading news from Dixons and Body Shop and confirmation of market fears of
poor trading at Alexon. Oil shares were roughly treated as crude oil prices
slipped below Dollars 17 a barrel and leading brokers cut oil price
forecasts.
The best individual performances in the Footsie 100 stocks came from the
power generators amid suggestions that the long-awaited contract to supply
British Coal was about to be signed.

worsening situation in the Middle East took hold once again, leading to a
poor market close, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened just ahead of Tuesday's close, good buying activity led to an
advance in the March contract and within half-an-hour of the market's
opening it was trading at around 2,770, leading the underlying cash market
higher.
However, economic worries coupled with the then vague talk of military
action in the Middle East led to a gentle retreat in March, and in the cash
market. It continued drifting lower as speculation about the situation in
the Gulf strengthened, and the contract fell to the day's low of 2,755 at
around 3.30pm.
Bargain hunters were seen at the close and March finished at 2,763, down 11
from its previous finish and around 7 ahead of its fair value premium to
cash of about 14. Turnover was 8,567 lots.
Most of the activity in the traded options continued to centre on the index
options which expire tomorrow. The FT-SE 100 option accounted for 8,822 lots
of the market's total volume of 32,734 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE saw
3,965 lots transacted.
Dixons, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option with
1,946 trades, followed by Hillsdown with 1,881.

FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to Iraq
attack news

Wall Street
US SHARE prices bounced back and forth yesterday before ending mostly firmer
in the wake of the attack by US and allied military forces on Iraq, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down just 1.08 at 3,263.56,
following a fall of more than 20 points earlier in the day. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.99 up at 433.03, while the American
SE composite ended 2.15 firmer at 398.56. The Nasdaq composite put in the
best performance, rising 7.33 to a record 686.78 on the back of a sharp rise
for Intel and strong demand for other technology stocks. Trading volume on
the New York SE was 245m shares.
Prices opened lower as investors continued to struggle to find good reasons
to buy stocks, while the absence of new economic statistics, and the lack of
movement from a becalmed bond market, ensured that trading remained
directionless.
The political backdrop deepened the gloom. Following rumours earlier in the
week of a planned attack on Iraq by US and allied forces, yesterday
afternoon the White House confirmed reports that a military strike had been
launched. The market took the news well, with share prices recovering almost
all the ground they lost earlier in the day.
Investors remained concerned, however, that a renewed conflict in the Gulf
could hinder economic recovery by depressing consumer and business
confidence, and possibly divert funds away from stocks to bonds.
Philip Morris receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 after disclosing that
shipments of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes fell 5.6 per cent last
year - the steepest drop in the brand's history and much larger than the
industry-wide decline in sales.
A variety of factors undermined airline shares, including signs of another
price war, concern that conflict in the Middle East could push up fuel
prices and scare passengers away, and profit-taking following big gains
earlier in the week. UAL dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 125 1/2 , Delta lost
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 7/8 , USAir shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 7/8
and AMR, parent of American Airlines, slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67.
Defence stocks received a boost from the reports of an attack on Iraq.
General Dynamics roser Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 109 1/8 , Lockheed Dollars 1
to Dollars 56 1/4 and McDonnell Douglas Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 1/4 on
hopes that another war would boost government spending on weapons.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel soared Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 110 1/8 , an
all-time high, in volume of 10.7m shares after reporting that fourth-quarter
earnings rose to Dollars 1.97 a share, well above market estimates.
Canada
THE TORONTO market finished lower after continued heavy trading. The TSE 300
index was down 16.2 at 3,298.3 and declining issues led advances by 348 to
265 after volume of 45m shares valued at CDollars 414.8m.
Corby Distilleries reported significantly higher nine-month earnings. The
'A' stock appreciated CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 47.

FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gulf worries upset
investors in the Far East

THE Nikkei average resumed its downward trend after Tuesday's brief rally.
The continued lack of government support for share prices combined with
worries about the Middle East to depress the market, writes Bethan Hutton in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei slipped 163.14 to close at 16,517.91. It fell from the
day's high of 16,688.97 at the opening to hit a low of 16,440.05 in the
early afternoon on television reports that the US had decided to retaliate
against Iraq.
Volume picked up to around 190m shares from the previous day's 150m. Brokers
said some of the heaviest trading was in shares being hedged against new
equity-linked bond issues.
Declining shares outnumbered those advancing by 689 to 209, with 189 stocks
ending unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares shed 10.52 to
1,271.46, after easing 1.95 on Tuesday. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
was a slight 0.19 off at 1,029.07.
Selling by companies hoping to shore up year-end balance sheets continued to
push the stock market down. The Nikkei's brief dip below 16,500 failed to
draw much buying from public pension funds, which are believed to have large
sums available for the purchase of equities before the end of this financial
year. Brokers now say heavy support buying from that quarter is not expected
until the Nikkei falls closer to 16,000.
Mr Ross Purdie of SG Warburg Securities said longer term factors would also
weigh against a significant increase in buying interest. 'We have still got
fairly high price/ earnings ratios, and although there are a lot of new
funds for investment in equities worldwide, we are seeing much less of those
funds coming to Japan,' he said.
Pharmaceuticals were sold heavily after reports that the government intends
to place time limits on the prescription of the high-priced drug Interferon
for individual hepatitis patients. Toray Industries, the diversified textile
manufacturer which is one of the main Interferon producers, fell Y18 to
Y629, while Sumitomo Chemical dropped Y24 to Y431 and Green Cross
relinquished Y60 at Y1,190.
The decline of the market ate into gains made by some issues earlier this
week, including Victor Co of Japan (JVC) which retreated Y36 to Y854. Canon
dipped Y10 to Y1,360 after the announcement that 1992 stepper sales were
down 30 per cent from 1991. Sony weakened Y50 to Y4,060 on news that the
company is to withdraw from the computer disc drive market.
In Osaka the OSE index finished 156.84 down at 18,164.34 in volume of 101m
shares.
Roundup
MIDDLE EAST fears haunted the Pacific Rim yesterday.
HONG KONG featured firmly with a 1.9 per cent gain, which some brokers
attributed to traditional optimism ahead of the Chinese New Year. The Hang
Seng index ended 107.48 higher at 5,778.74, after peaking at 5,796.74 in the
morning. Turnover came to HKDollars 3.4bn.
SINGAPORE fell as jittery investors turned sellers on a report of a possible
US military strike against Iraq. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
12.08 to 1,532.94 in volume of 94.9m shares.
AUSTRALIA was driven lower by volatile futures trading. The All Ordinaries
index shed 14.3 to 1,495.0, its lowest close since early December. Turnover
totalled ADollars 212.5m.
Westpac was the most active stock, down 7 cents at ADollars 3.04 on nearly
5m shares traded.
SEOUL gained slightly, with buying of small and medium-sized companies
offsetting institutional profit-taking in large-capitalisation shares. The
composite index put on 2.88 at 705.93 in Won874.6bn turnover.
TAIWAN reversed early losses as institutional buying of low-priced stocks
emerged just before the close. The weighted index, more than 30 points down
initially, closed a net 10.38 up at 3,227.93 in turnover of TDollars 6.9bn.
MANILA bounced back from the previous day's profit-taking as investor
interest spilled into the mining sector. The composite index climbed 12.59
to 1,320.76 and the mines index gained 8.3 per cent to 3,341.85. Combined
turnover grew to 280.2m pesos from 228.9m.
KUALA LUMPUR finished lower after investors liquidated positions amid rising
tension in the Gulf. The composite index was finally 2.18 off at 614.28
after an early high of 618.04. Volume amounted to 72.2m shares, against
63.2m.
BANGKOK recovered most of its earlier losses by the close, after sliding
21.24, or 2.3 per cent, in the morning on Middle East war rumours. The SET
index ended 3.33 down at 930.27 in active turnover of Bt14.09bn.

air strike

<TEXT>
NEWS that President George Bush had decided to launch a military strike on
Iraq came towards the close of trading on the continent, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT came under pressure from the tension between Iraq and the US and
the slowdown in the German economy. The DAX index fell 13.69 to 1,516.50 as
turnover rose from DM4.2bn to DM4.3bn.
Volkswagen closed DM4.40 lower at DM258.50 before the outcome of yesterday's
extraordinary board meeting on job cuts and lower investments. Siemens eased
DM4.80 to DM573 ahead of today's report on the first quarter of 1992/93.
Kugelfisher, the ball-bearing manufacturer, fell DM10.50 or 11.6 per cent to
DM80 on news that it would make losses in 1992 and 1993. Hoesch Umtausch,
representing the merger swap into Krupp AG, dropped DM10 to DM110, against
DM210 three months ago.
PARIS was weighed down by LVMH which fell as much as 7 per cent on its
return to trading after its suspension on Tuesday. LVMH's report on 1992
earnings prompted several brokers to downgrade their forecasts for 1993. The
CAC-40 index ended 14.23 lower at 1,782.53 in turnover of FFr2.4bn.
LVMH ended FFr161 or 4.7 per cent lower at FFr3,260 and its affiliated
companies also weakened.
Other fallers included Pechiney CIs which dropped FFr15 or 4.8 per cent to
FFr295 following poor results from Alcoa, the US aluminium company, and the
insurer UAP, down FFr16.70 to FFr476.30 on fears that it was exposed to the
Braer oil spill off Shetland.
AMSTERDAM finished unchanged with Royal Dutch recouping some of its losses
in the last minutes of trading on expectations of higher oil prices in the
event of renewed conflict in the Gulf.
The CBS Tendency index was flat at 96.4. Royal Dutch was down 70 cents at Fl
146.40 but above a low of Fl 145.60.
Begemann, the industrial group, fell Fl 7.50 or 9 per cent to Fl 72.50 after
reporting lower 1992 earnings. Polygram rose 40 cents rise to Fl 43.70 after
it said that it had increased its stake in two Japanese record companies.
Philips slipped 30 cents to Fl 20.50.
MILAN rose as Generali extended its recent gains. The market was also lifted
by hopes that on Friday the government will announce tax incentives to
stimulate investment in the stock market. The Comit index rose 7.74 to
458.85 in turnover estimated at close to Tuesday's L234.6bn.
Generali was fixed L800 higher at L30,800 before reaching L31,300 later.
Credito Italiano added L43 to L3,160.
ZURICH stayed faithful to the financial sector, UBS bearers rising SFr11 to
SFr886, CS Holding by SFr50 to SFr2,050 and Winterthur registered by SFr70
to SFr2,790. The SMI index fell 4.3 to 2,074.9.
Recent high-flyers in the pharmaceutical sector suffered from light
profit-taking. Some attention moved to second-tier shares where Sulzer rose
SFr11 to SFr605.
MADRID's general index rose 0.95 to 220.06 as Banco Popular supported the
financial sector on solid 1992 earnings and rose Pta150 to Pta11,900.
Viscofan, a manufacturer of sausage skin, gained Pta70 or 6.4 per cent to
Pta1,160 on news that a US competitor had filed for Chapter 11.
STOCKHOLM closed lower as afternoon selling wiped out early gains. The
Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.70 to 930.50 as turnover improved to
SKr875m from SKr708m.
Astra fell on reports that it might have to cut prices on several of its
products. The A share fell SKr8 to SKr707.
OSLO wiped out Tuesday's strong gains, due to falls in Norsk Hydro and
Hafslund. The all-share index eased 5.0 to 387.0 in light turnover of
NKr231m. Hafslund's B-shares lost NKr3.5 to NKr161 while Norsk Hydro closed
down NKr2.5 at NKr163.
BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index inched 3.02 higher to 1,149.03 points. The
pharmaceutical group UCB climbed BFr500 to BFr23,900 while Petrofina fell
for the third day, down BFr50 to BFr7,370.
DUBLIN continued to chip away at the 5.6 per cent gain it registered in the
first three trading days of 1993. The Iseq index fell another 18.95 to
1,259.25, down from 1,295.77 a week ago.
Davy Stockbrokers said at a presentation in London that the Irish cabinet
could decide to devalue the punt within two or three weeks, offering scope
for a post-devaluation rally of 10-15 per cent.
Davy like banks, noting that AIB has declined by 3 per cent over the past 12
months, and Bank of Ireland appreciated by just 13 per cent against gains of
39 per cent by UK banks and 49 per cent for their US regional counterparts.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell 101.14 or 2.4 per cent at 4,044.42 in
turnover of TL250bn. TEL AVIV fell for the third day on profit-taking by
private investors after last week's gains. The blue chip index lost 2.47 or
1.2 per cent to 203.32 in turnover of Shk180m.

FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan fails to live up to
expectations in 1992 - Economic problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani equities are expected to remain under pressure during the first
quarter of this year, after a disappointing performance in 1992.
In the first two weeks of 1993 the Karachi Stock Exchange index has
recovered some ground on good company earnings forecasts, having ended 1992
some 26 per cent down on the year. Yesterday the KSE closed 5.95 lower at
1,256.57.
In the first quarter of 1992 the market saw a strong rise amid expectations
of improved economic growth and expansion of business activity after the
government had announced new incentives to encourage fresh investments.
Better than expected growth in cotton production also fuelled projections of
improved profits in textiles. This strengthened textile shares, which
comprise almost one-third of the market's 622 listed companies.
But the buoyant trend which opened the year was quickly overtaken by reports
of new taxes in the budget, large-scale damage to property and the cotton
crop in last summer's floods, and fresh signs of political uncertainty.
Although the government remained committed to large-scale privatisation and
economic liberalisation, flood-related damage, estimated to cost Rs50bn
(Dollars 2bn), overshadowed the prospects for development. This also raised
new concern over spending which the government had earlier promised to
reduce in line with targets recommended by international financial
institutions.
Political problems also weighed on sentiment. Concern over a split between
the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), a regional ethnic party in Karachi, the
country's commercial capital, and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
last summer led to fears that the administration had become more vulnerable
to opposition-led attacks.
The combination of economic and political difficulties brought about the
largest fall in the market during the third quarter when the KSE index
dropped 269.3 points between July to September. A campaign of street
protests organised by the opposition alliance of Benazir Bhutto in November
also kept prices depressed.
Many brokers and investors now say that they are looking for new signs of
strong business confidence before seeing fresh large-scale buying. But
others are confident that, in spite of the downward trend, the KSE has
become an important emerging market as market capitalisation grows and
volume increases.
Over the past 20 months equity market capitalisation has shot up to
approximately Rs202bn from Rs104bn. 'In the last 20 months, the capital that
has come in is equivalent to the market capitalisation of the previous 40
years,' says Mr Amin Umer, former vice-president of the KSE, who finished
his tenure last week. He expects the index to reach the 1,400 level by the
end of the first quarter in 1993 which, he says, would be an accurate
reflection of share values.
Another broker, Mr Nasir Bukhari, argues that while the index is not likely
to rise significantly in the next couple of months, interest from foreign
investors indicates the market's growing importance. He notes that the
recent rise in market capitalisation includes a Dollars 300m investment from
overseas institutions in response to foreign exchange reforms allowing free
repatriation of capital and profits.
Investors have also been encouraged by financial sector reforms during the
past two years, but are cautiously awaiting fresh signs of economic
recovery.
One broker comments that reports that the public sector deficit for the year
is expected to rise beyond the target of Rs65bn has raised new concern.
'Many investors and brokers want to know if the economy will remain trouble
free, and if stocks such as textiles will grow, before making new
commitments.'

FT  14 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Firmer tone in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULLISH tone in Euro-pean cash and futures markets was a little more
pronounced yesterday after the Bundesbank gave several new indications that
it was relaxing its stance on monetary policy, writes James Blitz.
In its weekly money market intervention, the Bundesbank offered securities
repurchase funds for two weeks at the fixed rate of 8.60 per cent, as had
been announced at last week's Bundesbank council meeting.
However, to the surprise of some participants, the German central bank also
agreed to offer 28-day funds at a lowest accepted rate of 8.60 per cent.
Dealers said this underlined the market's belief that German rates are on a
downward trend.
There were several other technical indications that the Bundesbank was being
more accommodating. First, it provided more liquidity than the market had
expected, adding DM6.6bn, when dealers had expected DM2bn to DM3bn to be
added at the very most.
Moreover, the Bundesbank did not choose to add overnight liquidity through
emergency funds, which could have been used to mop up the shortages created
by tax payments.
According to Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, the Bundesbank
acted more generously by putting money into the banking system through its
fortnightly and monthly repos.
German call money yesterday dropped to around 8.68 per cent from the 8.75
per cent seen in recent days. Euromark futures already appeared to some
dealers to be offering fair value. The March contract closed 6 basis points
stronger at 92.05.
The surprise of the day in the sterling cash market was the sharp fall in
the overnight rate of lending to as low as 3 per cent at the very start of
trading.
Easy liquidity conditions may have triggered the low cost of money, with the
Bank of England forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m at the start of
operations. There were rumours that the Bank had been selling sterling on
the foreign exchanges to replenish its reserves in the wake of the events of
Black Wednesday. But this could not be confirmed.
Whatever the reasons, three-month sterling cash was much softer at around 7
per cent from a previous 7 1/8 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar edges up on tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR traded firmly against the D-Mark yesterday as Washington appeared
to be moving towards an attack on Iraq, but the US currency failed to break
through crucial technical barriers, writes James Blitz.
Political tensions in the world tend to be positive for the dollar, which is
deemed a 'safe haven' currency. Reports that President Bush was planning an
attack on Iraq pushed the dollar up to a high of DM1.6333 in European
trading, after a previous close of DM1.6320.
The US currency failed to make further headway. The market remains uncertain
whether President-elect Bill Clinton will announce a fiscal package to
stimulate the economy, because of indications that the US is already
enjoying a recovery.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London warned against buying the dollar as
a result of the Iraqi situation alone. He said the start of the Gulf war in
February 1991 was accompanied by a sharp fall in US consumer confidence, due
to rising oil and commodity prices. If repeated, this would depress the
currency again.
The dollar closed in London yesterday at DM1.6325. In New York, however, it
fell around 1 pfennig to end at DM1.6220.
The D-Mark continued to soften against the French franc as the Bundesbank
provided new indications that it might lower short-dated interest rates
again.
The Bundesbank added more liquidity to the German cash market in its weekly
inter-vention than had been expec-ted. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, improved sentiment by saying that the central bank was prepared
to show further flexibility on interest rates.
The franc rose to another six-week high against the German currency,
finishing in London at FFr3.391 to the D-Mark, after a previous close of
FFr3.395. It was some 4 centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark.
Given the more accommodating stance of the Bundesbank, there are growing
reasons to think the battle of the franc may have been truly won. But a
question hanging over the French currency is whether the Bundesbank will
ease monetary policy quickly enough to allow France to lower rates from
their high levels.
Mr MacKinnon said the Bundesbank will await the outcome of the talks on the
Solidarity Pact and the January inflation figures before making any more
decisions.
But Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris was quoted yesterday as
saying that another gesture on interest rates would probably be required
from the Bundesbank before the end of the month, if tensions were to be
allayed.
A devaluation of the Irish punt would also focus attention again on the
French currency. The Irish punt traded well above its ERM floors, but
one-month Irish punts were still quoted at around 30 per cent at the end of
the day.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian lithium deal set to be
shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIAN MINING officials say it is now almost certain that a deal to mine
the world's biggest reserves of lithium, a light, heat-resistant metal used
in the manufacture of aluminium, ceramics and glass, is to be shelved
indefinitely.
The collapse after five years of negotiations, between Lithco, a subsidiary
of the FMC corporation, and successive Bolivian governments should be
announced officially by early February. Lithco has given the government 30
days to shift its negotiating position, an eventuality now seen as extremely
unlikely.
This was a crucial deal for both parties. Lithco, facing competition in the
lithium field from Cyprus Minerals, already present in neighbouring Chile,
and needing a surface mining operation to enable it to convince foreign
investors it was ready to do business, was equally eager for a deal.
According to calculations by Mr Fernando Urquidi Barrau, a respected
observer of the mining scene, the Bolivian government stood to make about
Dollars 30m a year for the 40 year duration of the contracts.
The affair will further damage Bolivia's image with foreign investors,
particularly in the light of the recent fiasco over joint venture contracts
between the private and state sectors. While emphasising that existing
private mining ventures fare well, Mr Charles Bruce, executive vice
president of mining consultants, Mintec, acknowledges this is a 'black eye
for the government'.
Despite appearances, however, the government is not entirely to blame. As Mr
Urquidi contends: 'It looks as if Bolivia kicked Lithco out, but this is an
incorrect impression'.
Mr Urquidi speculates that Lithco was using both the Salar de Uyuni deposit
in Bolivia and the similar Salar del Hombre Muerto deposit in Argentina as
bargaining chips in a bid to secure rights to the Atacama deposit in Chile.
Observers believe Lithco may have already signed a contract with Amax
Minerals and Energy, the American company that owns the rights to the
Chilean deposit.
Lithco has been a tough negotiator with Bolivia throughout. It insisted on a
40-year contract with a ceiling of 400,000 tonnes of lithium. In addition,
it demanded a 10 per cent VAT rate rather than the usual 13 per cent. The
Bolivian government eventually agreed to these terms, reducing its profit
share rather than openly caving in on the VAT issue. The contract was signed
by the Bolivian president on February 1992 and ratified by congress, though
with three additional clauses which proved unacceptable to the company.
It is widely believed that Lithco had by then decided to pursue the Chilean
deposit. Although Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni is believed to hold the largest
lithium deposits in the world, it is apparently contaminated by high
quantities of magnesium, which complicates the exploitation process.
Infrastructure in Chile is far better. Furthermore, Chile is perceived to be
more politically stable than Bolivia. Ultimately this was crucial in
Bolivia's loss of the deal.
Lithco and Cyprus are the only corporations with the capability to mine
lithium on such a scale. Both have now apparently secured deposits which
will see them into the next century, leaving Bolivia out in the cold.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London Fox considers changes to
sugar market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON sugar futures market committee yesterday considered a
consultants' report on developing the London markets, including one
suggestion that the raws contract should change from dollars to sterling,
reports Reuter.
'Those in favour of having a sterling raw sugar market are growing in
number. But it will have to be considered further and it is much too early
to take a decision at the moment,' said Mr Michael Overlander, the
committee's chairman.
The report, by Landell Mills Commodities Studies, was commissioned by the
London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) in June last year. The intention
was to discuss ways in which the markets could adapt to changing world
market conditions.
Traders have been concerned in particular by the recent decline in volumes
on the raw sugar market.
In a previous attempt to revive interest, the market switched from floor
trading to Fox's screen-trading system FAST, only to revert to the floor a
year later, in January 1992.
Changing to sterling from dollars would open the way for arbitrage trading
with the New York market, dealers said.
It has also been suggested that the exchange should rejuvenate the existing
white sugar options contract.
The committee will now consult with other market users on the findings of
Landell Mills' report. 'We will expect to have completed this by early
March,' said Mr Robin Woodhead, Fox's chief executive.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bad weather halves Norwegian
crude output
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S 2.3m barrels-a-day oil production has been cut by nearly half since
Monday as storms have hampered offshore crude oil loading by tankers, and
two fields may be closed today unless the bad weather relents.
The 100,000 barrels-a-day Snorre platform, operated by Saga Petroleum,
Norway's biggest independent oil company, has been shut down since Monday,
while the 700,000 b/d Statfjord field and the 450,000 b/d Gullfaks field
have both been restricted to about 50,000 b/d. Both fields operate offshore
crude oil loading systems from which tankers are able to load crude only if
waves are below 4.5 metres. Yesterday, they were exceeding five metres. The
two platforms' oil storage capacity was nearly filled and seven tankers were
queueing to load crude.
Statoil official Ms Wencke Skorge warned that unless the tankers were able
to load crude by last night, Statfjord and Gullfaks would have to be closed
this morning. It would take about 24 hours to bring the fields back on
stream. Ms Skorge estimated that the closures of the two platforms would
mean a gross revenue loss of Dollars 250m a day.
Last year, Statoil produced a record 1.1m barrels of oil a day, or an
aggregate 442m barrels for the year. Production was also temporarily halted
yesterday at Oseberg, Oseberg C and Gamma North fields, operated by Norsk
Hydro. The fields' oil is piped ashore to storage tanks from where it is
loaded by tankers. Bad weather has also interfered with these operations.
The Ninian oilfield in the UK North Sea was expected to halt production
later yesterday if bad weather kept the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland
Islands closed, said Chevron Corporation, the fields operator, reports
Reuter.
The closure of the Ninian field would also result in the closure of the
Magnus field, operated by British Petroleum, the Total-operated North Alwyn
field, Unocal Corporation's Heather field and Lasmo's Staffa field, Chevron
added. Oil from these fields is piped to Sullom Voe via the Ninian field.
The total oil pumped, including Ninian, is some 300,0000 to 350,000 barrels
a day.
BP said it had shut down the 20,000-25,000 b/d Thistle platform after a plug
failure on the main oil line led to gas and oil leaking into the crude
pumping area.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq crisis fails to revive
oversupplied oil market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES increased by some 30 cents a barrel yesterday following the news
of US raids on Iraq, but the market quickly slipped back into fears about
over-supply and prices dropped. North Sea Brent crude for March delivery
ended unchanged at Dollars 17.10 a barrel.
'The news about Iraq made many people nervous in the market and speculators
moved to cover short positions,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, market analyst at ED
&amp; F. Man in New York. But he said producers were selling into the rally.
New York prices were stronger than those in London in spite of production
problems in the North Sea because of severe storms. March futures prices on
the New York Mercantile Exchange were up 23 cents in mid-day trading at
Dollars 18.79 a barrel.
In spite of the tension in the Middle East, traders were still worried about
over-production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Iraq
is at present barred from exporting oil by United Nations' sanctions and
action against it has no short term threat to oil supplies.
Libya said yesterday it would cut 50,000 barrels a day, but traders were
sceptical.
Venezuelan oil officials indicated to the Reuter news agency yesterday that
Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec's current president was
embarking on a Middle East tour to seek a deal that would take 600,000 b/d
out of the market before Opec's next meeting on February 13.
Analysts believe Opec must cut at least 1m b/d if it is to lift oil prices.
The International Energy Agency said it expected world oil demand to
increase by 600,000 b/d in 1993, a modest rise of just 1 per cent from
levels in 1992.
At the same time, figures released by the American Petroleum Institute late
on Tuesday night showed that US stocks of oil products had increased last
week. Stocks of heating oil, diesel oil and jet fuel were up by 1.1m barrels
and gasoline stocks had risen by 5.4m barrels.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOL Australian wool prices drifted gradually lower at the opening sales of
the second half of the selling season this week. The AWC market indicator
was 500 cents a kg on January 13, down 9 cents. Farmers are putting up some
resistance to what for the vast majority are uneconomic prices and
withdrawing wool at their own reserves or prior to the sale, but this in the
longer term only means that more re-offered wool may later come onto the
market. Christmas Sales were very low with almost 4 million bales
overhanging the market. Excess of supply keeps buying slow and cautious.

BRAZILIAN COFFEE exports declined significantly in terms of both volume and
value in 1992, according to figures released by the Brazilian Federation of
Coffee Exporters.
Brazil exported 16.4m bags (60 kg each) of coffee last year, down by 16.4
per cent from the 1991 total of 19.6m. Earnings came to Dollars 927.7m, a
reduction of 36.5 per cent from 1991. The average price for Brazilian beans
on the international market fell from Dollars 74.68 a bag in 1991 to Dollars
56.68 last year.
The federation attributed the lower volume to a reduced harvest. It
estimated that the final tally would be between 18.8m and 24m bags, compared
with 28m bags in 1991.

GOLD moved back towards a seven-year low on the London bullion market
yesterday. Despite news of President Bush's decision to launch a military
strike against Iraq, sentiment remains bearish. Comex gold futures were
lower at midday, with New York traders pointing out that the yellow metal
was continuing to lose its appeal as a safe haven during times of
international turmoil. 'The market is much more scared of central bank
selling and currency fluctuations than anything going on in the Middle
East,' said one. COPPER prices ended a nervous LME session higher, with the
market largely consolidating after Tuesday's massive declines, while
ALUMINIUM also finished steadier. Dealers said the copper market seemed to
pause amid confusion over its likely direction. Dips towards the Dollars
2,200 a tonne level for three-months delivery elicited buying support. In
Chicago WHEAT futures were sustaining early gains in late trading, under the
influence of the USDA's crop reports.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic farming outgrows its
niche - An industry conference in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD favourites remained as popular as ever: papers being given on the
'Nodulation and Nitrogen Fixation of Selected Food Legumes in Organic
Systems' and 'Ecological Agriculture and Indigenous Knowledge in the
Bolivian Andes'.
But conspicuously encroaching on the agenda of a recent international
scientific conference on organic agriculture in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were
topics that reflect increasing commercial success. Among the most salient
issues under discussion at the gathering were trade, regulation, and
certification standards. 'We've grown out of our niche,' proclaimed Mr
Volkert L. Engelsman, representative of Eosta, a Dutch trading company that
deals in organic and 'biodynamic' agricultural products.
In an age of growing ecological and health awareness mainstream growers can
no longer discount their organic competitors as a fringe element unable to
tell a balance sheet from scrap paper destined for the recycling bin. If
there is anything extraordinary about organic agriculture it is the sector's
growth. 'It is growing like crazy,' remarked Mr Thomas B. Harding Junior, a
Pennsylvania organic farmer, and vice president of the International
Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements.
Mr Harding looks like your average American farmer, with the sturdy build
and slight paunch of a man who appears to enjoy his meals. As the only
businessman (as well as the first non-European) among the German-based
federation's leadership, he was the man with the figures. He estimated that
organically cultivated products had a worldwide market of between Dollars
30bn and Dollars 40bn a year, mostly in Europe, with Germany in the lead.
America, he said, accounted for between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 5bn of
that - with the figure expected to reach Dollars 10bn by 1995. Countries
like Mexico and Brazil were emerging as important producers, he noted.
The success of this market depends on the ability to assure consumers that
their produce, grains and processed foodstuffs are healthful and grown using
environmentally sound practices. Some customers even want to be satisfied
that labourers and small farmers, especially in the Third World, get a
better deal than usual.
Organic agriculture professes the use of natural inputs - spurning the use
of chemical pesticides, for example. Biodynamic agriculture is a stricter
cousin, using a 'holistic' approach that, among other things, aims to turn a
farm into a 'closed organism', using recycling and other means to generate
as many of its own inputs as possible.
Unique consumer demands cry out for a credible certification system,
creating more than the usual tension between free trade and regulation. 'All
regulations are trade barriers, and we hate them,' said Mr Engelsman. 'But
as a movement dedicated to better agriculture, we see the need for some
protectionism.'
The biggest barrier to international trade right now appears to be a set of
European Community standards taking effect this month for imports. The
regulations were implemented for EC producers in July, but the deadline for
third countries was extended to allow more time for registration.
Listening to exporters, the scheme sounds like old-fashioned trade
restriction. 'More paperwork and bureaucracy,' complained Mr Alexandre H.
Harkaly, of the Biodynamic Institute, a Brazilian non-governmental
organisation that provides assistance to organic farmers. But they had
better be prepared. In the US, a 1990 law similar to the EC provision is
scheduled to take effect for imports in October.
In many countries, the private sector is attempting to solve the
certification problem through self-regulation. But, as Mr Engelsman puts it,
that leads to a Christmas tree of certification labels too numerous to cram
on to your average box of herbal tea.
Government control, business people admit, may be the only answer - but the
private sector wants a say. 'We're all worried about government control, but
we need to play by a common set of norms,' said Mr Harding. 'Organic can't
mean something in one place and something else somewhere else.'
Another new twist is on the distribution side. Traditionally, organic
products have been sold primarily in health food stores. Now supermarkets
are showing interest. In England, 90 per cent of organic products are
already sold in supermarkets and in Denmark the figure is 70 per cent,
according to Mr Engelsman.
Some major foodstuffs producers have explored opportunities in the sector,
but smaller organic companies do not feel threatened yet. 'The corporations
do not have a lot of experience with products that are not standardised,
especially in terms of availability and continuity. They like to have
everything exactly the same,' said Mr Ulrich Walter of Euroherb, a German
company with a DM12m (Pounds 4.8m) annual turnover, that supplies organic
herbs, spices, tea and coffee.
Growing interest from big business has even given Mr Walter's company a
boost. Euroherb supplies DM, the German drugstore chain, with a line of
about 20 herbal teas sold under the chain's Alnatura brand name.
Organic growers and distributors, whose prices tend to be higher than those
of their conventional rivals, are leading advocates of environmental
accounting, a concept batted around at the 'Earth Summit' in Rio de Janeiro.
The approach would make businesses put numerical values on things like
environmental degradation. Mr Harding noted that organic agriculture used
less non-renewable resources, less energy, and that the lack of chemical
fertilisers eliminated the threat of aquifer (water source) contamination
and improved the health and safety standards of farm workers. 'If you
account for these things, we produce more cheaply,' he said.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Middle East tension adds to struggles in
US Treasury market

US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as the market, still
struggling with the weight of new corporate supply, anticipated a flight to
government securities in the wake of the Middle East crisis.
At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 102
1/16 , yielding 7.445 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.422 per cent.
In early trading Treasuries were weaker, especially in the middle of the
yield curve, as dealers marked prices down ahead of the afternoon auction of
Dollars 9.75bn of seven-year notes, which was completed at an average yield
of 6.41 per cent.
Continued worries about the impact on the market of the steady flow of
corporate bond issues also contributed to the early declines. Some investors
were comforted by the fact that the market absorbed Dollars 6.5bn of
corporate debt on Tuesday without inflicting serious damage on prices.
The market rebounded strongly after the White House confirmed that the US
military and allied forces had launched an attack on Iraq. The buying was on
the assumption that in times of international political crisis, domestic and
overseas investors look to US assets, and short-dated US government
securities in particular, as a temporary safe haven.
UK government bonds closed higher as investors bought at the higher yield
levels.
The Liffe futures contract rose from 99.13 to 99.26 by late afternoon on
volume of about 24,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2003/07 rose from 118 21/32 to 118 31/32 to yield 8.85 per cent.
Dealers said domestic investors were tempted to buy as yields had risen to
relatively attractive levels after Tuesday's fall in the gilt market. The
gilt market fell back on Tuesday on news that the Bank of England will hold
a gilt auction on January 27.
NEW supply and heavy selling combined to depress German government bond
prices across the yield curve yesterday.
The Liffe bund future contract, which opened at 92.88, traded in a range of
92.76 to 92.91 before ending the day at around 92.80.
News that the postal authority sold DM2.87bn of notes at tender depressed
prices. The auction of six-year notes raised DM2.87bn at an average price of
98.84 and an average yield of 6.99 per cent.
Dealers added that several German banks were thought to have sold five-year
notes yesterday, after buying the paper earlier in the week at the time of
the launch of Italy's DM bond issue.
Bunds showed little reaction to GNP data which showed a slowdown in the
economy last year. The statistics office said that west German GNP rose 0.8
per cent in 1992 after a rise of 3.6 per cent in 1991.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said in a speech that
the main priority for monetary policy remained to limit inflation, but he
added, 'that does not rule out all leeway for the Bundesbank's monetary
policy'.
Dealers said the Bundesbank took the market by surprise by adding a net
DM6.6bn in liquidity into the domestic banking system through a tender of
securities repurchase funds, when a slight drain of funds had been expected.
FRENCH government bonds edged higher across the yield curve, helped by the
franc's relative firmness in the foreign exchange markets.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 moved from 8.04 per cent to
8.02 per cent by late afternoon as the franc strengthened from 3.3965 to the
D-Mark to 3.3890.
JAPANESE government bonds soared to new highs, but the gains were wiped out
by reports that President Bush planned to launch an attack on Iraq and both
the cash and futures markets ended the day slightly lower as a result.
Dealers said the market opened on a strong note, following on from Tuesday's
rally and encouraged by the weak stock market and strong buying interest
from institutions.
The March futures contact, which opened at 108.80, rallied to a high of
109.08, the highest level for the leading contract in nearly five years.
However, after profit-taking the futures contract fell back to end at
108.73. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened
at 4.44 per cent and moved to 4.41 per cent, before ending at 4.45 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria uses reverse FRNs
in DM500m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Austria joined the growing list of sovereign borrowers
tapping the D-Mark Eurobond market yesterday. It chose, however, to use the
reverse floating rate note structure rather than the straight Eurobonds
favoured by larger-scale borrowers. Reverse floaters appeal to investors who
believe D-Mark interest rates will come down soon.
Austria increased its 10-year issue twice, finally settling for DM500m after
launching it through Trinkaus und Burkhardt at DM300m. Bankers re-ported
good demand although the pricing is less generous than seen on other recent
issues of this type. The coupon is 8 1/4 per cent for the first two years,
then 13 1/8 per cent minus six-month Libor thereafter.
Mr Helmut Eder of the Austrian Federal Financing Agency, the agency
established at the start of this year to act on behalf of the republic in
these matters, said the republic would borrow the equivalent of about
Dollars 3bn abroad in 1993.
Austria intended to continue holding its foreign debt obligations in Swiss
francs, D-Marks, yen and Dutch guilders, he said, but it would issue in
those currencies which offer the best arbitrage opportunities.
DG Bank also led a DM75m 10-year subordinated reverse floater for
Westfalische Hypothekebank, targeted at retail investors. It offers a coupon
of 10 1/4 per cent for the first year, and will then pay 20 per cent minus
twice six-month Libor.
Province de Quebec became the third Canadian province to tap the
international markets this week, following Ontario and British Columbia,
which both raised US dollars. Additionally, the Province of Alberta, which
has been widely expected for several weeks to tap the international markets,
raised CDollars 750m domestically.
Lead-manager Wood Gundy said Quebec's CDollars 500m seven-year 8 1/2 per
cent Eurobonds would provide a new benchmark in the seven-year area, given
the absence of other current coupon liquid issues. The bonds were still in
syndicate at the close of business, reflecting the slackening of
international demand for the currency after the spate of issues seen so far
this year.
Other bankers said the bonds were slightly expensive and added to unsold
positions. There have now been some CDollars 2.1bn of bonds issued
internationally already this year.
Credit Commercial de France said the European Investment Bank's FFr3bn
eight-year 8 per cent issue confirmed the firmer tone of the French franc
market. The issue maintained its spread of 24 basis over comparable French
government bonds in early trading after breaking syndicate, said CCF, and
was widely described as a successful deal.
Other banks agree that investor interest has revived in the French franc
after its recovery against the D-Mark. Economic fundamentals in France are
good, they say, and there is widespread expectation that D-Mark rates are
set to fall. The EIB is as usual using a deferred rate setting system, which
allows it to lock the spread at which it can lend the funds to future
borrowers.
The Council of Europe's Dollars 150m two-year 4 5/8 per cent issue through
S. G. Warburg should benefit from pent-up demand at the shorter end of the
curve, said bankers. European investors who are happy with dollar exposure
but who think yields will go higher can buy such short-term bonds as an
alternative to placing their funds on deposit in the money markets, they
say.
Cariplo's Dollars 200m five-year issue of floating rate depositary receipts
through Lehman Brothers could prove the true litmus test of Italy's renewed
international acceptability after the problems of recent months, rather than
the republic's successful DM5bn deal, say bankers. The paper qualifies as
senior debt.
Credit Foncier de France's DM1.5bn 10-year straight bonds, launched on
Tuesday, were priced to give the expected launch spread of 20 basis points
over government bonds.
NORWAY plans to hold six bond auctions in 1993, Reuter reports. The
Norwegian central bank did not disclose the size of the offerings nor
maturity dates of the bonds to be issued, but said it may hold ad hoc
auctions to supplement the regular auctions.
The first bond auction in 1993 will be held on January 25, with an
announcement planned for Friday. The other bond auctions will be held on
March 22 (announcement March 12), May 24 (May 14), July 26 (July 16),
September 20 (September 10) and November 22 (November 12). Settlement dates
are four days after the auction.

airline's flotation

<TEXT>
THE stock market flotation of China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's flag-carrier,
has flopped, underlining the depth of the local stock market's year-old
slump, Reuter reports from Taipei.
CAL's first public offer of 41m shares last month was initially
oversubscribed, but investors had committed funds to buy only 11 per cent of
the shares by the payment deadline on January 9, CAL said.
The airline will now seek to sell the roughly 36.5m shares not taken up by
other means, such as private placements.
The offer, at a price of TDollars 68 (USDollars 2.67) a share, aimed to
raise about USDollars 110m. It would have cut the stake in CAL held by the
China Aviation Development Foundation, a private body, to about 80 per cent
from 85 per cent.
'We feel disappointed with the result. But it will not affect our goal of
listing on the stock market,' CAL said, adding it planned to list in late
February.
Analysts said the CAL offer was a bad omen for future big equity offerings
in Taiwan, including privatisation issues by the government.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Clark seeks Dollars 100m
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLARK Equipment, the US capitals goods manufacturer, is looking for an
acquisition of around Dollars 100m that could take it into a new business
sector.
Last summer, Clark sold its lift truck business to Terex, the US industrial
and construction machinery group, for Dollars 90m. The sale prompted
considerable interest among investors about Clark's future plans.
Mr Frank Sims, Clark's senior vice-president, said in London yesterday that
Clark was looking at companies worth around Dollars 100m in businesses which
would fit with Clark's current range. 'It would be a mid-sized company to
which we could add value,' he said.
There were a surprising number of opportunities among private companies, or
divisions of big corporations, he said.
The acquisition was more likely to be in the US, to balance costs such as
retiree health expenses.
Clark has all but completed a big programme of investment in its
manufacturing base, but Mr Sims stressed that it intended to be patient in
its search for a takeover. It could, alternatively, do 'bolt-on'
acquisitions for its present businesses.
Clark's 1992 results will be out next week. Its main problem is the
unconsolidated VME, which has been hit by the construction equipment
recession worldwide and is undergoing a restructuring. Clark's share in
VME's nine-month loss was Dollars 40.7m.
Mr Sims said he was cautiously optimistic for 1993, with business conditions
improving in the US.

CREDIT Lyonnais yesterday said it had reached an agreement in principle to
acquire Chase Manhattan Bank Austria, the Austrian unit of Chase Manhattan
Bank, AP-DJ reports from Paris. Terms were not disclosed.
The French state-owned bank said that the acquisition, which must be
approved by Austrian banking authorities, would strengthen its presence in
Austria. Until now, Credit Lyonnais has had a representative office in the
country. Credit Lyonnais said Chase wwould retain a representative office in
Vienna.
Chase Austria is capitalised at Sch20m (Dollars 1.75m) and had assets almost
Sch2.5bn at the end of 1991.
The Chase unit specialises in lending and services to corporations and
selected private customers. The French bank said the acquisitions fits in
with its recent acquisition of BfG Bank of Germany.

Astra shares

<TEXT>
BANK Indonesia, the central bank, has approved the sale of 100m shares in
Astra International, which dominates the country's motor vehicle sector.
The bank's go-ahead is a step forward in resolving the company's two-month
ownership crisis.
The Soeryadjaya family, Astra's founders, have been selling down their stake
following the collapse of their privately-owned Bank Summa with obligations
of Rp1,600bn (Dollars 776m).
A Bank Indonesia executive, however, cast doubt that the sale of shares
would lead to an early return of money for Bank Summa's large-scale
depositors.
He also said it was 'unlikely' that the consortium negotiating to buy the
shares would set up a new bank into which the accounts of the depositors
could be transferred.
The 100m shares are currently held by a consortium of three banks - Bank
Danamon, a publicly-quoted bank, and Bank Exim and Bapindo, both state-owned
banks - against loans of Rp500bn on which the Soeryadjayas are in default.
Brokers say the two state-owned banks may keep 20m shares, which would raise
the Astra stake purchased by state institutions since mid-November to 27 per
cent.
Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who has led negotiations with the Soeryadjayas for the
sale of the shares, is expected to buy about 15m shares, with Mr Liem Sioe
Liong, who runs the Salim group, taking about 10m shares, brokers say.
Other members of the consortium are reported to include Mr Henry Pribadi, Mr
Ibrahim Risyad and Mr Sudwikatmono, all Salim group executives.
Indomobil, Astra's main competitor, is a Salim group subsidiary, and brokers
warn that the presence of so many Salim group executives in the consortium
could undermine Astra's independence.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Exercise in reassurance at
Nippon Credit Bank - Officials dismiss talk of restructuring despite
problems with property loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES at Nippon Credit Bank have tired of reassuring clients and
financial partners who have been made wary by a flurry of Japanese media
coverage suggesting that the long-term credit bank is buckling under the
weight of bad property loans.
Further reassurance was needed following the announcement this week that a
former Finance Ministry official, Mr Hiroshi Kubota, will become NCB's
president later this year. Not surprisingly, the appointment was widely
interpreted as a sign that Mr Kubota will preside over a restructuring of
the bank, which has by far the largest ratio of property loans to total
loans of Japan's leading banks.
But a senior NCB manager said the choice of Mr Kubota was simply a
conventional case of amakudari (literally, descending from heaven), the term
given to the transfer of senior bureaucrats to corporate posts at the end of
their government careers. NCB insisted he would not preside over a
restructuring 'because we don't need a restructuring'.
The bank says its loan portfolio has attracted attention, and inspired
concern, simply because the institution has taken action to deal with
non-performing property-related loans at three affiliated finance companies,
while other leading banks have yet to confront their mounting bad loans.
The three leasing and credit companies were large property-related lenders,
either accepting property as collateral or providing funds to developers,
leaving the institutions with non-performing loans estimated at 20 per cent
of outstanding loans. In response, NCB persuaded other banks to take cuts in
interest rates on loans to the trio, and made clear that it would ensure
their survival.
'We have resolved our problems. Our capital adequacy ratio is over 9 per
cent, and we have a three-year restructuring plan for the three companies.
In Japan, we have a very co-operative way of solving our problems,' a senior
NCB manager explains.
NCB was formally established in 1957 with the aim of providing long-term
capital to industry, though it traces its ancestry to the Bank of Chosen,
which was the central bank of Japanese-occupied Korea from 1909 to 1945 and
was responsible for issuing bank notes in Manchuria, in northern China.
From 1957 to 1977, it was known as the Nippon Fudosan Bank, or the 'Japan
property bank', with property-related loans still accounting for 23 per cent
of lending at the end of the last fiscal year. This is twice as high as most
leading Japanese banks, with Bank of Yokohama next in line at 14.3 per cent.
Like other Japanese banks, NCB is profiting from falling interest rates,
which are creating favourable margins. This resulted in a 108.7 per cent
rise in operating profits to Y57.4bn (Dollars 458m) in the six months to the
end of September. However, the costs of Japan's financial and property
market collapse were more evident below the operating profit line.
Pre-tax profits were down 48 per cent to Y22.5bn, with Y23.8bn of the
difference due to losses on securities holdings, while there was Y11.1bn
addition to loan loss reserves. Salomon Brothers Asia calculates that these
reserves are only 0.9 per cent of total loans, which, taking into account
Japanese taxation regulations, is equal to a 1.8 per cent cover on an
after-tax basis.
Japanese banks say it is a mistake to focus only on those reserves as they
also have a large pile of unrealised gains on securities holdings which
could be used in emergency. In NCB's case, the continuing weakness of Tokyo
stock prices left that pile 52 per cent smaller at Y439bn over the year to
the end of September.
Tapping all the unrealised gains would mean selling strategic holdings in
leading corporate clients, and the threat of rupturing these relationships
puts a limit on stock sales. Large sales would also undermine the bank's
capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank for International
Settlements.
NCB's impressive capital adequacy ratio - 9.08 per cent at end-September,
well above the 8 per cent BIS threshold and higher than most other Japanese
banks - has raised questions about the effectiveness of that measure. One
bank with a better BIS ratio, at 9.15 per cent, is Nippon Trust Bank, which
reported a 47.3 per cent fall in net profit to Y1.1bn, without booking hefty
appraisal losses on securities holdings.
Japan's Finance Ministry has given banks enough flexibility in asset
valuation regulations to enable them to write off non-performing loans
gradually, and still report profits. Mr David Marshall, senior analyst at
IBCA, the rating agency, says auditors and regulators in the US and Europe
would force institutions to recognise potential losses more quickly.
'In Japan, the point in prepearing accounts is not necessarily to recognise
losses. Most important of all from the regulators' perspective is to
maintain confidence in the financial system,' Mr Marshall says.
A more accurate measure of the troubled loan exposure of NCB and other
Japanese banks may come at the end of the fiscal year in March, as the
Finance Ministry says individual institutions will announce figures for
non-performing loans. All that has been officially released is a lump figure
of Y12,300bn for the largest 21 banks at end September, a 54 per cent rise
over the first half.
NCB says changes have already been made to its management style of the late
1980s, when banks, and their affiliates, competed feverishly for new
customers as stock and property prices rose sharply. Another manager at the
bank explains that risk analysis has been reviewed, though Japanese
companies generally may need to alter views on who is ultimately responsible
for loans.
'It is true that we have become more cautious, perhaps over-cautious, in
lending. Japanese have always looked at who is the ultimate backer of a
loan, rather than at the hard collateral, so people thought we were backing
these three companies, even though our links to them were not so great,' he
says. 'People should look at more than a company's name in doing business.'

posts loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge Canada, the forestry concern 72 per cent owned by
Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, reported a net loss of NZDollars 7.4m
(USDollars 3.78m) in the December quarter compared with net earnings of
NZDollars 27.5m in the corresponding period a year earlier.
The year-ago period included a non-recurring net gain of NZDollars 56.3m
related to the sale of the company's 45 per cent interest in an affiliate,
Donohue St-Felicien
The latest result represented a significant turnround from the Dollars 28.8m
net loss recorded for the three months to September 30, Fletcher Challenge
said.
Mr Doug Whitehead, president of Fletcher Challenge Canada, said the
second-quarter result 'offered encouragement that a recovery is starting to
build'.
Sales rose to Dollars NZ404.1m from NZDollars 399m a year earlier, in spite
of the absence of production from the Hammond saw mill, sold in December
1991, and lower newsprint prices.
The increase in sales reflected increases in shipments of 49 per cent for
newsprint and 11 per cent for lightweight coated paper, combined with
improved pulp and lumber prices and a favourable movement in Canadian and US
dollar exchange rates.
Cash-flow from operations, NZDollars 900,000, was above break-even for the
second consecutive quarter.
Fletcher Challenge Canada said it was in a strong position to take advantage
of recovering pulp, paper and lumber prices and expected significant
improvements in earnings.
Mr Whitehead said the indications were that markets would continue to
improve during the second half of the financial year.

<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the London-based music and entertainment company 79 per cent owned
by Philips of the Netherlands, has increased its stakes in two
majority-owned Japanese record companies. The move is to help it expand in
Japan, the world's second-biggest music market after the US.
PolyGram has acquired the remaining 35 per cent stake in Nippon Phonogram
from JVC and Matsushita, taking its holding to 100 per cent.
It has also increased its stake in Polydor KK to 89.6 per cent from 74.6 per
cent following a purchase of shares from JVC. The remaining shares are owned
by corporate shareholders, each holding a relatively small stake.
The two transactions have a combined value of Fl 45m (Dollars 23m) and will
take effect retroactively from October 1992.
The aim is to enable PolyGram to consolidate its Japanese businesses into
one new operating company, PolyGram KK. The two music companies will retain
separate creative and marketing activities, but finance and administration
will be done by the new Japanese operating group.
Nippon Phonogram and Polydor are active in international pop and classical
music, as well as in local Japanese music, an area in which PolyGram aims to
expand.
In 1991, PolyGram generated Fl 1.1bn in sales in Japan and south-east Asia,
representing 17 per cent of group net sales.

MARRIOTT, the US hotel and food services group which faced bondholder anger
over a plan to split its management operations and property assets into two
separately-quoted entities, said yesterday the management side had fared
well in 1992. Marriott International, the name envisaged for the proposed
management company, made pro-forma operating profits of Dollars 320m to
Dollars 350m last year, with over 70 per cent coming from lodging, the
company said.
Operating profit for Marriott overall was expected to stand at about Dollars
490m to Dollars 500m, compared with Dollars 478m for the previous year.
The property company, due to be called Host Marriott, would take in 140
hotels and 16 retirement communities and would have had a total operating
cash-flow of about Dollars 350m in 1992.

vote

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property group, is expected to delay
the most crucial vote in its restructuring process while it tries to resolve
differences with a key group of unsecured lenders.
The unsecured group, which consists mainly of North American, European and
Japanese banks, will determine whether the ailing developer is able to
emerge in a restructured form from the court bankruptcy protection which it
sought last May.
Unlike O&amp;Y's secured creditors, whose collateral consists of specific
properties and shares in O&amp;Y-controlled companies, the unsecured lenders'
claims, which total about CDollars 4bn, are against the company.
A total of 33 creditor groups are voting this week on a restructuring plan
covering about CDollars 8.5bn in debt.
By midday yesterday, 11 groups had approved the company's proposals, while
another eight had adjourned their meetings to consider minor amendments.
Five meetings were scheduled for yesterday.
The unsecured creditors are scheduled to vote on O&amp;Y's proposals on Friday
afternoon, but the meeting is likely to be delayed until some time next
week.
A lawyer for one large unsecured lender said yesterday that one or two
sticking points remained.
The lawyer said that an agreement would probably be hammered out eventually.
'Everyone is in the same boat with the fundamental interest of making sure
the company doesn't sink,' he said.
Recoveries by unsecured lenders will depend largely on the course of the
North American property market and O&amp;Y's ability to rebuild its property
management and development business.
One group of secured creditors, with claims on Fifth Avenue Place, a Calgary
office building, yesterday rejected O&amp;Y's restructuring proposals.
The lenders are thus entitled to seize the building immediately, but have
indicated that they will appoint O&amp;Y to manage the property.
Secured creditors who approve the reorganisation plan also have the right to
take over their collateral, provided they give 30 days notice.

DELTA Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, and Swissair, the
European airline, yesterday unveiled a new agreement on certain
transatlantic routes.
The agreement could come into effect by June this year, subject to
appropriate government approvals.
The ultimate goal, the two carriers said yesterday, was to provide
'seamless, quality customer service'.
Under the deal, Swissair will reserve a block of seats, in all three travel
classes, using its flight designator on a new daily non-stop service
operated by Delta between Cincinnati and Zurich.
Delta will operate the same system on Swissair flights operating between
Atlanta and Zurich, New York (Kennedy airport) and Geneva, and New York
(Kennedy) and Zurich.
The two airlines, which have held small cross-shareholdings in each other's
equity since 1989, also plan to share terminal facilities at the airports in
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Geneva, New York (Kennedy) and Zurich for arriving,
departing and connecting passengers.
The move by Delta, which has been troubled recently by heavy losses and the
difficult integration of assets acquired from the now-defunct Pan Am, and
Swissair is the latest in a series of international airline alliances.
These include the operational integration between KLM and Northwest
Airlines, and the proposed share stake investments by American Airlines in
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, and Air Canada in the US's Continental
Airlines.

CLUB Med Inc, the US subsidiary of Club Mediterranee, the French leisure
group, saw net profits fall 15 per cent to Dollars 25.8m in the year to
October 31 because of the sluggish US holiday market.
The poor performance of the US subsidiary was one of the main problems faced
by Club Mediterranee last year.
Club Med Inc, which is 72 per cent owned by its French parent company, was
hit by competitive market conditions and the price war among US airlines.
Turnover fell to Dollars 516.42m from Dollars 518.71m in its last financial
year, while pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent to Dollars 27.56m from
Dollars 31.83m
The US company recovered in the final quarter when net profits rose by 64
per cent to Dollars 3.89m from Dollars 2.37m on stable turnover of Dollars
113.9m.
Club Mediterranee last month announced it had returned to the black in its
last financial year, in spite of the problems of its US business.
The French group mustered net profits of FFr160m (Dollars 29.62m) in the
year to October 31 against a FFr17m loss in the previous year.

INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US paper group which has been expanding fast in
Europe, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 176m, after taking a
Dollars 263m after-tax charge for a productivity improvement programme.
The company said the results worked through at a loss of Dollars 1.46 a

Mr John Georges, chairman, said the company had achieved fourth-quarter
sales comparable to the second and third quarters, in spite of difficult
conditions in the US and European economies.
Pulp and paper sales rose to Dollars 995m, from Dollars 970m, while
paperboard and packaging improved to Dollars 895m from Dollars 870m and
distribution to Dollars 735m from Dollars 685m. Specialty products were up

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the world's largest semiconductor supplier, yesterday posted record
sales and earnings for 1992, outperforming even the most optimistic Wall
Street projections.
The Californian company's stock rose Dollars 8 1/8 to a high of Dollars 110
1/8 in New York yesterday. despite nervousness in the market about Iraq.
Its growth reflects strong sales of personal computers, for which Intel is
the leading supplier of microprocessors. Intel said that it had exceeded its
goal of shipping 4m to 5m 386 and 486 microprocessors in the year.
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive, said: 'Our business is
in excellent shape as the new year begins, with strong demand across most of
our product lines.'
Fourth-quarter sales rose 54 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn, up from Dollars
1.21bn a year earlier, while net profits surged 127 per cent to Dollars 429m
from Dollars 189m. Earnings per share emerged at Dollars 1.97, against 90
cents for the previous fourth quarter.
Wall Street analysts, who lifted estimates in mid-December when Intel
signaled strong fourth-quarter earnings, had projected per-share net income
of about Dollars 1.59.
Booming sales in the fourth quarter completed a strong year for Intel with
turnover for the 12 months up 22 per cent at Dollars 5.84bn, compared with
Dollars 4.78bn in 1991. Net profits were Dollars 1.07bn, or Dollars 4.97 per
share, up from Dollars 819m, or Dollars 3.92 a share.
As well as record microprocessor shipments, Intel said sales of other
products including standard semiconductors, system level and networking
products, were strong.
Intel has been the world's fastest-growing chipmaker for the past five
years. Recently it surpassed NEC of Japan to become the world's largest
chipmaker, according to Dataquest, the US market research firm. Intel's
success has been based largely upon sales of its flagship microprocessor
products. The company is, however, expected to face increasing competition
in the personal computer microprocessor market later this year when Advanced
Micro Devices, a Silicon Valley rival, plans to launch its own version of
the top-selling 486 microprocessor.
This year Intel is expected to introduce its next generation of
microprocessors, called Pentium. The powerful devices are expected to be
used initially to power mid-range computers called 'servers' that are linked
to personal computer networks.

devaluation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) is set to record a loss for the third
successive year in 1992, following the devaluation of the Swedish krona
which will produce a SKr1.2bn (Dollars 162m) one-off loss.
The company declined to estimate its year-end figures, but analysts believe
the loss is likely to be around SKr700m. In the first six months of last
year, the airline recorded a SKr502m profit, but is believed to have been
held to a break-even operating result in the second-half because of
recession and intensifying competition, particularly in the Swedish market.
SAS said that during 1992 the krona fell by about 27 per cent against the
dollar and by 20 per cent against the D-Mark, helping to aggravate the
group's debt from SKr18bn to SKr25bn since the krona was floated in
November.
The currency loss might have been greater but for a strategy of switching a
portion of foreign currency debt into Swedish kronor during the last few
months of 1992, the airline noted.
SAS said the krona's devaluation would have a limited impact on its 1992
operating result.

THE two-year struggle by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power
and electrical engineering group, to buy control of Rafako, Poland's biggest
power-boiler producer, has been thwarted by a worker and management buyout.
The move is a setback for ABB's drive to build a dominant stake in the
power-generating industries of eastern Europe. Over the last three years,
ABB has concluded 26 joint ventures in eastern Europe, including several in
Poland where its main company, ABB-Zamech, employs more than 50 per cent of
the 16,000 people now working for the company's joint ventures in eastern
Europe.
ABB last week announced a joint venture in the Czech republic, where it
purchased a 67 per cent stake in the boiler, turbine and power plant
division of Prvni Brnenska Strojirna (PBS), one of the country's largest
power-plant producers. Last year, it reported Dollars 13m profit on sales of
Dollars 125m.
The Rafako buyout announcement was followed by a similar development at the
Szczecin shipyard on Poland's Baltic coast.
The yard, the most modern in Poland, is to be handed over for a 'symbolic
fee' to a consortium of domestic banks and companies, as well as management
and employees, according to a letter of intent signed yesterday by Mr Janusz
Lewandowski, privatisation minister.
'Wherever the terms of purchase offers are equal, plants should stay in
Polish hands,' Mr Lewandowski said yesterday.
Rafako was founded in 1949 and its boilers are installed in plants
throughout the country, making it a key component of any energy industry
modernisation programme. Last year, the debt-free company recorded sales of
501bn zlotys (Dollars 31.7m), around 20 per cent to export markets.
A new company owned by the 2,500 employees will purchase 50 per cent of the
equity for 72.8bn zlotys, while management will subscribe to a further 5 per
cent share and workers will individually purchase another 20 per cent. The
remaining 25 per cent will be sold through a public offer.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais raises FFr600m
in asset disposal

CIMENTS Francais, the scandal-scarred French cement group, has raised
FFr600m (Dollars 109m) by selling peripheral businesses to try to cut its
debts and to offset the losses from the off-balance sheet dealings
discovered last autumn.
The disposals, which were completed before the end of last year, include
Ciments Francais' 32.9 per cent stake in Guintoli, the French building
company at the centre of the scandal, part of the group's stake in Scori, an
industrial concern, and mineral interests.
The FFr600m raised by the disposals will be injected into Ciments Francais'
1992 accounts. But the group will continue to benefit from the subsequent
fall in its financial costs due to the cut in the interest payments on its
debt.
Ciments Francais has been clouded by controversy since the discovery in
September of hefty losses on its off-balance sheet dealings estimated at
FFr1.05bn.
The company has already announced it fell into the red with a net loss of
FFr740m in the first half of 1992 (from net profits of FFr113m for the same
period of 1991) mainly because of the FFr655m exceptional losses on its
off-balance sheet dealings.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: French banks see further
property loan losses
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH banks will continue to shoulder losses from their exposure to the
troubled property market for the next three to six years, but the worst
seems to be over, the head of the AFB French banking association said
yesterday.
The problems of the Parisian property market needed 'a specific solution,'
but 'this does not mean necessarily that there is need for financial
assistance from the public authorities,' Mr Michel Freyche, the AFB's
president, told Les Echos newspaper.
'We need adjustments of fiscal and regulatory measures,' he added. Banks
wanted to spread their property provisions over time, as they did with
sovereign debts, so as to benefit from a future improvement market
conditions.
Mr Freyche was unable to estimate AFB members' exposure to the property
market, where average commercial rentals in central Paris have fallen by 20
per cent from a peak three years ago. Estimates of French banks' property
loans vary from FFr250bn (Dollars 45.4bn), by the Paris commercial court, to
FFr500bn by Paribas and Suez, the investment banks. Estimates of the banking
industry's property losses vary from FFr45bn to FFr80bn.
'By the end of three to six years, the crisis will be completely over and
with it the potential losses,' he said.
Mr Freyche gave a lukewarm reception to the tax and regulatory measures
launched by the government last month to stimulate the property industry.
The measures were 'positive and useful but insufficient.'
Last year had been 'difficult, above all for banks strongly exposed to
property,' said Mr Freyche. 'On top of this came the difficulties of the
economic situation, with a record year for small business bankruptcies. I
think, however, that 1993 will be a better year for provisions on individual
risks. The biggest provisions seem to me to behind us,' he predicted.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Spanish directors quit at Cofir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Spanish operations of Mr Carlo de Benedetti's Cerus group
is in doubt following the resignation of several directors of Cofir, the
holding company for the Spanish business.
Mr Jose Ramon Alvarez Rendueles, a former governor of the Bank of Spain who
was chosen by Mr de Benedetti to be Cofir's founding chairman in 1988,
resigned from his post and from the board, as did fellow directors Mr
Alberto Cortina, one of Spain's most prominent industrialists, and Mr Javier
Gurpide, a deputy chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
'We are just very frustrated about our involvement in Cofir. We once had
high hopes but there has been an absence of strategy and our expectations
have come to nothing,' a former board member said.
Mr Alvarez Rendueles, who is chairman of Banco Zaragozano, and Mr Cortina,
one of the bank's main shareholders, represented Zaragozano's 12 per cent
shareholding in Cofir and Mr Gurpide represented BBV's 10 per cent holding
in the company. Both banks named lower-ranking representatives to Cofir's
board in what is viewed as a temporary measure before their disinvestment
from the company.
Mr Pedro Cuatrecasas, a Barcelona-based lawyer, was appointed Cofir's new
chairman and Mr Gabriele Burgio, an Italian associate of Mr de Benedetti,
was named managing director replacing Mr Juan Llopart, Cofir's chief
executive.
Cerus, which controls more than 40 per cent of Cofir, hit difficulties
following its failed bid for Societe Generale de Belgique, and, with the
onset of the 1990s, Cofir began to lose its acquisitive drive.
Cofir is understood to have put on the market its 49 per cent stake in
Bodegas Berberana, a Rioja wine producer and its Portuguese unit, Cofipsa.
Cofir remains highly liquid with funds over Pta20bn (Dollars 173m), mostly
routed towards government paper.

FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Siemens sets up unit to manage
pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the Munich-based electronics group, is to become the first German
company to set up a separate internal investment management subsidiary,
hiving off the management of funds provided to meet its pension liabilities.
At the same time, it plans to raise from DM3bn to DM6bn (Dollars 1.8bn to
Dollars 3.7bn) the amount invested through so-called special funds,
dedicated investment funds used by German companies among other things to
finance their pension obligations. About half of the DM3bn invested at
present is managed by Deutsche Bank.
The decision to increase the amount invested through special funds, and to
consolidate the management through a new entity, signals a further step in
the development of pension fund investment in Germany.
The company, whose enormous cash resources are such that it is often
labelled a bank with an electronics business attached, intends to transfer
DM5bn to DM6bn to the new subsidiary within the next six months. Total cash
resources are in the region of DM20bn.
Under German rules, there is no obligation for pensions monies to be kept
legally separate from the companies' own cash resources, as in the UK and
US.
Mr Herbert Lohnreiss, one of the new company's two managing directors, said
Siemens had decided that over the longer term it would be better to manage
this element of its cash resources in house. He said the decision did not
reflect dissatisfaction with the performance of the funds under management
by third parties, or even a wish to save management fees. The funds will be
invested for the long term in bonds and equities.
The new subsidiary, to be known as Siemens Kapitalanlagegesellschaft (SKAG),
will employ about 12 people. The move, which has already been authorised by
Germany's banking authorities, may establish a precedent for other German
companies with large cash resources.
The move has interesting historical resonances as it was a member of the von
Siemens family, founders of the electronics group, who set up the Deutsche
Bank 123 years ago. The bank subsequently grew to be Germany's biggest bank.
Siemens' financial strength means it is less reliant on traditional banking
relationships than other German companies.

<TEXT>
BANCO POPULAR, the Spanish commercial bank 47 per owned by non-Spanish
institutional investors, yesterday reported net profits of Pta54.4bn
(Dollars 468m) for last year, a rise of 9.6 per cent on 1991, writes Tom
Burns.
Popular improved its return on average assets last year to 2.12 per cent
from 2.01 in 1991 and will pay a dividend of Pta730 per share, a 10.6 per
cent rise on last year's payout.
Anticipating what is likely to be a sharp drop in profit margins among
Spanish banks, Popular's results were down on last year's when it reported a
15 per cent increase in net income against 1990.
Non-performing loans on Popular's 1992 balance sheet rose by 28 per cent to
Pta40.4bn and allowances for credit losses were up by 31.8 per cent to
Pta33.3bn, a figure which represented 110.1 per cent of the mandatory bad
debt coverage requirement.

The net asset value of Aberforth Split Level Trust was 181.7p per capital
share at December 31, down from 196.7p at the trust's July year-end and
185.9p at end-December 1991.
Net revenue for the six month period amounted to Pounds 804,000, down from
Pounds 842,000 last time, equivalent to earnings of 5.36p (5.61p) per income
share.
An unchanged second interim dividend of 2p is declared, making 4p to date;
directors warned, however, that it was unlikely that last year's total of 9p

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dudley Jenkins Group, the USM-quoted mailing list broker and supplier of
services to users of direct mail, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 383,000
for the half year ended October 31.
That was an improvement of 51 per cent over last time's Pounds 254,000 and
came on the back of a 9.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 5.18m.
However, the interim dividend is trimmed from 1.35p to 1p.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.71p (2.54p).
In considering the dividend, the directors said they also considered the
enlarged number of shares now in issue - 9.04m at the period end against
6.06m.
In their view, 'it would be imprudent to follow a progressive dividend
policy, resulting in a continued uncovered dividend'.
For the last full year to end-April the group paid a total dividend of 4p
which was uncovered by earnings of 3.9p per share.

6%

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Business Group, the photocopier and vending machine supplier,
yesterday announced a 15 per cent dividend increase in spite of much smaller
rises in turnover and profits.
A final dividend of 2.23p is proposed, making a total of 3.38p, an increase
of 15 per cent.
Mr David McErlain, chairman, said the company was confident about the
outlook and had ridden out the recession. The shares added 4p to 115p.
Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 15.3m in the
year to September 30. The increase was due to acquisitions made during the
period, which contributed Pounds 850,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.47m.
Profits from continuing operations were unchanged at Pounds 14.4m.
Turnover from continuing operations gained 5.6 per cent to Pounds 53.8m.
Including acquisitions, turnover increased 12 per cent to Pounds 57.3m.
Earnings rose 5.5 per cent to 10.62p per share.
Forward contracted income increased 5 per cent to Pounds 313m, helped by
about 1,000 new customers signed up during the period. These customers made
up for reduced volumes from customers affected by recession, Mr McErlain
said.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A formula full of eastern promise - Oresa
builds on early success in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Jonas af Jochnick set up his door-to-door cosmetics company in
eastern Europe two years ago there was no shortage of pessimists -
including, to some extent, himself.
So far, however, the doomsters appear to have been proved wrong. Oresa,
formed with Pounds 10m capital in 1990, is likely to have achieved sales of
more than Pounds 25m in the year to the end of December 1992. Profits are
expected to be 'substantially better' than the Pounds 500,000 achieved on
sales of Pounds 4m in the first year.
'People were warning us it would be difficult,' he says. Trying to get
people to work as effectively as in the west is given as one example.
'They said the people had been destroyed under communism. In fact, we have
found it has been exactly the opposite. They are enormously hard-working.'
In just two years Oresa has built up a network of 50,000 sales people.
Mr af Jochnick and his brother, Robert, were the brains behind the UK-quoted
Oriflame International, the door-to-door retailer and manufacturer which
supplies cosmetics and toiletries to Oresa. Originally from Sweden, the
brothers set up Oriflame in 1967 following their discovery of the Tupperware
party phenomenon in the US.
After a brief flirtation with the jewellery market in the UK and Sweden
during the 1980s, the two brothers decided to return to their cosmetic
roots. However, the depressed UK economy and the almost impregnable
stranglehold on the sector by the likes of Avon, one of the world's biggest
door-to-door cosmetics retailers, made expansion difficult.
Then, in 1989, the Berlin wall came down and everything changed. While Avon
was busy ferrying its representatives out to the wall with free welcome
samples for migrating east Germans, Oriflame got to grips with legislation
in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Within six months it decided to set
up a separate entity, chaired by Jonas, to pursue joint ventures and
acquisitions in eastern Europe.
The UK company, headed by Robert, was only prepared to put in Pounds 2.5m
for a 25 per cent stake. Shareholders were offered the opportunity to invest
a further Pounds 7.3m through an unusually structured issue of seven Oresa
shares for every one Oriflame. Investors were warned by Robert that not only
was Oresa 'highly speculative', but that 'there is a risk the entire
investment could be lost'. Furthermore, there would be no hope of a dividend
in the foreseeable future.
In spite of such grim warnings, Oresa has 'gone like a rocket', says Robert,
whose own company was Pounds 1m richer at the interim trading level, the
result of both sales and royalties from supplying Oresa.
The two most important factors for door-to-door selling - people eager to
work and people eager to buy - were there for the taking. Both Jonas and
Robert say Oresa benefited from the lack of a retail structure and high
unemployment in the former communist bloc.
The brothers are also convinced that their decision to commit an entire
company at the very early stages has given them the head start over bigger
rivals such as Avon, which so far has concentrated mainly on the former
eastern Germany and Hungary.
It has not been an easy road, however, as Jonas is quick to point out.
'Going into eastern Europe in 1990 was a little bit like being in the Wild
West,' he says. 'You have to be very flexible and adapt.'
The difficulties seemed endless - from recruiting suitable local management
to coping with inflation of 70 per cent in Poland. Learning to cope with the
ever-changing legislation of the former eastern bloc has also been a
traumatic experience.
In Russia, for example, 'we had no idea whether the import regulations which
applied when the product was sent would actually be those applied when it
arrived two weeks later,' Jonas says. The especially volatile conditions of
the former Soviet Union have meant a more cautious approach to setting up
there.
Currency problems are also a potential nightmare. However, in the countries
where Oresa operates regulations allow the purchase of hard currency to pay
for its imports. Oresa trades in local currency and also uses it to invest
in its own manufacturing facilities.
The company has recently purchased a Polish factory which will require
investment of at least Pounds 7m. Jonas says the money will be internally
generated.
The biggest difficulty, however, has been margins. According to Jonas it is
impossible to sell at prices similar to those in the west. 'We had to give
people the opportunity to purchase what they were not used to . . .
cosmetics and toiletries of European standards.' Therefore, the lipstick a
British customer buys for Pounds 3.25 will be sold for roughly Pounds 2.30
by Oresa.
Eventually the Polish factory should allow Oresa to manufacture more
cheaply. In the meantime, however, 'we will simply have to be more
economical'. Jonas also argues that his company operates on far lower costs
than its western counterparts, using local employees and management.
The critics, however, are dubious. 'It is an expensive process selling
door-to-door,' says Mr Simon Knott, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton. 'You
have got to have the right margins.'
Furthermore, the sheer scale of risk remains with much still uncertain in
eastern Europe.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Newman Tonks brings dividend forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Newman Tonks have decided to bring forward payment of the final
dividend for the 14 months to end-December 1992.
A second interim dividend of 5.5p in lieu of a final will be paid on March
29 making a total of 9.3p for the 14 months - the same as was paid for the
previous 12 months.
Last July the directors announced that the year-end was to be changed from
October 31 to December 31 and that future final dividends would be paid in
May. They said yesterday that they were bringing forward payment in order to
give shareholders more time to adjust to the new payment timetable.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GKN to expand US production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services group, is to build a
new plant in Roxboro, North Carolina, to assemble and distribute vehicle
driveline components.
It is also to expand its manufacturing facilities at nearby Sanford and
Alamance.
In combination, the investments will increase GKN's North American
production capacity for such components by 60 per cent between now and 1996.
They form part of a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.8m) expansion plan outlined last
October. At the time, however, GKN was still reviewing its options on
precisely how capacity should be expanded.
The new facilities, to be operated by GKN's North American subsidiary, GKN
Automotive, will give it capacity to build 3.3m constant velocity joint and
driveshaft sets per year.
Set up in 1976, GKN-AI has become the main independent North American
producer of such components, supplying Ford and Chrysler as well as Japanese
'transplants' operated by Toyota, Honda and Mazda.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: First Leisure shows modest gain to Pounds
31.1m - Growth record maintained despite 'increasingly adverse trading
conditions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST LEISURE, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions
group, maintained its 10-year record of profits growth in spite of what it
described as 'increasingly adverse trading conditions'.
The company, which was bought from Trusthouse Forte for Pounds 37.5m in 1983
and floated the following year, increased its pre-tax profits by 2.3 per
cent to Pounds 31.1m in the year to October 31. Turnover rose 2 per cent to
Pounds 108.5m.
The profits figure was flattered by a Pounds 1.3m credit, arising from
unclaimed capital allowances. The company hopes to negotiate a further
credit of Pounds 700,000 for the current year, but said its tax rate was
likely to increase from last year's low of 20 per cent to an underlying rate
in the high 20s.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the modest improvement in profits had
been achieved even although six of the group's largest discotheques had been
closed for refurbishment during periods of the year. Overall capital
expenditure rose from Pounds 29m to Pounds 34m, about Pounds 8m of which was
spent on the discos.
The group invested heavily in its Blackpool Tower and Winter Garden complex,
but most of its expansion is now geared towards expanding its spread of
10-pin bowling alleys and discos. Mr Conlan said the fall in property values
in the south-east of England gave the group an opportunity to expand there,
particularly around and within the M25.
In spite of the heavy capital expenditure, net borrowings remain flat at
Pounds 33m and gearing fell slightly, from 13 to 12 per cent.
Although First Leisure dipped its toe into European waters by buying a large
disco in Amsterdam two years ago, Mr Conlan said the priority would be to
expand in the UK. As well as participating in large edge-of-town leisure
complexes, the group is looking at challenging the grip of Bass and Rank
Organisation on the bingo market. It is also looking at opportunities in the
health and sports field.
Lord Rayne, chairman, said that as the group expanded it would be
increasingly able to benefit from benefits of scale in its buying of drinks,
goods and equipment such as amusement machines. It is investing Pounds 3m in
electronic point of sale technology and hopes to use it to emulate large
retailers by improving margins and stock control.
Mr Conlan said that while he was planning that 1993 would be a year of
recession, as 1992 had been, the group would continue to invest heavily from
cashflow and would benefit quickly from any recovery in consumer confidence.
Earnings per share rose to 15.83p (15.67p). A final dividend of 4.26p gives
a total of 6.14p (5.695p), an increase of 7.8 per cent.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Downturn to Pounds 10.3m at Watson &amp; Philip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based wholesale and retail food group, reported
a 12 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 10.3m,
in the 53 weeks to October 30, reflecting deteriorating trading conditions
in the second half.
Turnover improved to Pounds 492m (Pounds 461.8m). However, sluggish sales
from the core business - supplying food to shops not owned by the group -
offset good performances from its Spar and VG convenience stores, cash and
carry shops, and its higher-margin catering supply division.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 10.7m. Mr Ian Macpherson,
chairman, said shoppers were spending smaller amounts, on average only
Pounds 2.30 a visit by the year-end, compared with Pounds 2.60 last year.
He added that conditions were particularly tough in southern England where
the group was expanding its network of Alldays convenience stores. Many new
stores failed to trade profitably, but business was better in northern
England and Scotland.
He said up to Pounds 500,000 lost through bad debts and shrinkage
exacerbated weak sales. In addition, the group paid Pounds 470,000 in
exceptional expenses associated with the closure of a retail services depot
and restructuring of the retail services division.
Earnings per share declined to 21.7p (25.4p). The final dividend is
increased to 9.1p, making a total of 13.3p (12.8p).
A 16.2 per cent stake in the group, worth about Pounds 15m, was sold
yesterday morning by the Jacques family, from whom W&amp;P bought Amalgamated
Foods in a Pounds 35.5m all-share deal in May 1991. The price was at 'a
modest discount to the market', the group said; the shares closed 1p higher
at 285p.
Mr David Bremner, managing director, said the Jacques family made their
intention to sell known in December, having been constrained by a standstill
agreement precluding any sale before May this year without W&amp;P's consent.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: D Smith rises to Pounds 15m on back of
French unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID S SMITH, the paper and packaging group, announced pre-tax profits of
Pounds 15.2m for the half year ended October 31, against Pounds 3.1m
previously, which was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 8.7m.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said the contribution from Kaysersberg
Packaging, the French company acquired for Pounds 154m at the end of last
March, had more than offset the fall in profits in the UK paper division -
which only broke even.
UK packaging maintained profits, but the UK paper business had been hit by
unfair competition from Germany, Mr Williams said. The group has lodged a
complaint with the European Commission.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 171m to Pounds 259m, with Kaysersberg
chipping in Pounds 81.7m.
Operating profits of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 11.4m), included Pounds 11.9m from
Kaysersberg, whose high margins offset a decline elsewhere. However, an
interest charge of Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 400,000 credit) was all due to
Kaysersberg.
In the UK, conditions were the worst he had experienced. But Mr Williams was
now more optimistic about a recovery in demand, with corrugated case
material volumes up 7 per cent, allowing a small price increase.
Redevelopment of the Kemsley mill was nearly complete and by the autumn it
would be producing at an annual rate of 400,000 tonnes. Kemsley has been
losing between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m a year.
A labour dispute at the Abbey Corrugated sheet feeder plant cost more than
Pounds 1m and volumes there had yet to be rebuilt.
Mr John Miller, finance director, said that a high level of capital
spending, Pounds 27.7m in the first half (Pounds 7.4m) and an expected
Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m for the year (Pounds 21.7m), meant the group should
pay no tax in the current year and a low charge for the next couple of
years.
Net debt of Pounds 95.1m (cash of Pounds 13.7m) at the end of the half year
gave gearing of 43.9 per cent. However, fluctuations in the franc, in which
most of the debt is denominated, could change gearing significantly.
Earnings per share were 12.2p (3.4p after the exceptional charges) and the
interim dividend is unchanged at 2.75p.
COMMENT
Smith's share price initially rose in reaction to the figures, but after the
market considered the implications of a weaker continental market the shares
fell back to close 1p lower at 314p. Forecasts were shaded back too, an all
too familiar and depressing story with Smith. However, by comparison with
the substantial losses being made in other parts of the paper industry Smith
is doing well. There is still every hope of reasonable profits growth in
coming years. Forecasts of about Pounds 28m (Pounds 24.1m before
exceptionals) and no tax, give a prospective p/e of about 14, which gives
nothing away.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of the First National Finance Corporation is discussing with its
advisers a possible rights issue of convertible preference shares to raise
about Pounds 47m.
The results for the year ended October 31, 1992 will be announced tomorrow.
The board said that the loss before taxation will be in line with market
expectations.
Extraordinary items in the second half, which relate to a revaluation of the
group's own premises, write-offs in the discontinued property division and a
disposal were about half the level of the first six months.
No ordinary dividend is being recommended for the year.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon expects to break-even and pass
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXON Group, the women's wear retailer, confirmed yesterday that because of
poor trading it only expected to break-even in the current financial year
and to pass its final dividend.
Alexon's shares, already battered by a profits warning six weeks' ago, fell
a further 9p to close at 68p, marking a new low since its demerger in July
1991 from Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier.
At its peak the stock touched 444p, but has dropped steadily because of
concern about the effects of the recession and management mistakes on stock.
The group said yesterday, in a statement that had been expected, that
trading up to Christmas had been 'disappointing.' In particular, sales of
its Dash brand leisure wear were 'well below the levels of last year.'
The directors warned that 'on the basis of current overall trading,' pre-tax
profit before exceptional items for the financial year ending this month
'will be around the break-even level.' This compares to pre-tax profits of
Pounds 11.3m in 1991-92 when a final dividend of 7.6p was paid.
In the first half of this year Alexon posted a 46 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 2.08m on reduced turnover of Pounds 48.7m.
Yesterday the company said total exceptional costs for the year, including
reorganisation costs, were likely to be about Pounds 1m.
Steps have been taken to cut costs and streamline the organisational
structure, including a 20 per cent reduction in head office personnel. These
steps should result in ongoing savings of at least Pounds 1m a year.
Analysts had awaited the Alexon statement with concern that further stock
write-downs might be necessary. However the group emphasised yesterday that
despite the poor sales performance in the second half, stock levels of
autumn/winter ranges were similar to last year and no material writedown of
this stock was expected.
As highlighted at the interim stage, the sales shortfall in in the first
half resulted in higher than normal spring stock levels, which will
contribute to somewhat higher year-end levels.
There has also been criticism that Alexon has been slow to change its
classic women's wear formula. However the company said yesterday that its
relaunched Eastex range for older women had performed well, with sales ahead
of last year, and that post Christmas sales of all brands had been 'slightly
more encouraging.'
It added that over the past 12 months extensive trials and market research
had been undertaken in preparation for the relaunch of the Dash Brand this
year.
In the wake of yesterday's statement analysts expressed the hope that all
the bad news was out of the way. However, some concerns remain about
trading, the balance sheet and the quality of management.

BRICOM'S bankers have appointed Mr Tony McCann as chief executive with a
brief to develop a long-term strategy for the company.
Bricom started as a management buy-out from British &amp; Commonwealth before
being taken over in 1990 by a group of Swedish investors led by Gamelstaden.
It is now controlled by its bankers after running into financial
difficulties.
Mr McCann, who has worked for Black and Decker and Littlewoods, said he
planned to identify the core-businesses and those which might be for sale.
Bricom recently sold Spinneys, a group of marketing and retail companies, to

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US side cuts Dixons to Pounds 14m - Shares
fall 29p despite good Christmas and new year trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES IN its US chain hit half-time profits of Dixons, the electrical goods
retailer. At the pre-tax level they dropped from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds
14.2m in the 28 weeks to November 14.
Despite reported good Christmas and new year trading in the UK branches, the
shares fell 29p to 225p.
Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, said he was fairly confident UK sales
would continue the improvement seen in the first half and over Christmas,
though recovery was fragile. In the US there was more evidence that the
recession was turning.
Earnings were down from 1.6p to 1p but the interim dividend is unchanged at
1.6p.
Operating losses in the US rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 10.9m), while UK
profits of Pounds 20.7m compared to Pounds 20.5m, which included a Pounds 5m
release of excess provisions.
Mr John Clare, group managing director, said despite the higher losses, good
progress had been made in rebuilding Silo, the US chain acquired for Dollars
320m in 1987. But it had now been decided to close 45 stores in the
mid-West, involving 550 jobs, at a cost of Dollars 40m. A provision would be
made in the second half. Further ahead, 'substantial new investment' would
be needed in Silo.
Asked if the acquisition of Silo had been a mistake, Mr Kalms said: 'You can
form your own conclusions'. Losses from Silo in the last two years have
exceeded earlier profits.
Mr Clare said that 'profit recovery will take some years' but stressed that
the management's view was that turning Silo round was a better option than
pulling out.
Mr Kalms said that sales in the Dixons and Currys chains in the UK moved
ahead strongly from mid-July. Christmas and new year sales rose 17 per cent,
and were ahead of budget, although margins were slightly lower because of
higher promotional costs.
The European property activities lost Pounds 400,000 before interest (Pounds
2.9m profit). Mr Shrager, finance director, said that no sales had been
completed in the first half but seven had been so far in the second half.
Group turnover totalled Pounds 873.4m (Pounds 871.7m). Interest receivable
was Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 3.9m) as capitalised interest rose from Pounds 2.5m
to Pounds 6.2m, and Pounds 2.3m was charged to provisions.
After tax and dividend payments there was a retained loss of Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 100,000 profit).
Mr Shrager said the half year statement complied with new accounting
standards and the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee, including a full
balance sheet and a report from the auditors.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS to Lilley said there had been 'massive interest' in the businesses
of the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group, which collapsed
last week with debts of more than Pounds 80m.
Price Waterhouse, the receivers, have put a deadline of noon tomorrow for
inquiries about the businesses, which have work worth about Pounds 100m in
hand.
A further announcement, possibly relating to finalised trade sales or
management buy-outs, will be made tomorrow afternoon.
Meanwhile at Westminster, 18 MPs put their names to an early day motion
expressing deep concern at Clydesdale Bank's 'cynical' decision to call in
the receivers and the 'subsequent actions of the receivers in ending the
trading of financially healthy subsidiaries of the Lilley Group.'
The motion went on to note that the receivers were 'now stating' to
companies owed money for work carried out for MDW, a Glasgow-based
construction subsidiary, that 'debts outstanding of almost Pounds 16m have
been transferred to Lilley Group plc, who will be unlikely to make these
payments.'
It called on the department of trade and industry to introduce regulations
to safeguard the rights of viable companies in such circumstances.
Mr Iain Bennet, the partner in charge of the receivership, said every effort
had been made to continue the activities of the subsidiaries, although 343
people have so far been made redundant out of a total of 1,900 employed by
the subsidiaries which are in receivership.
Mr Bennet said it was true that trade creditors to subsidiaries were
unlikely to receive any payment, but said this was inevitable when a group
went into receivership and its assets and the likely proceeds of its
disposals were greatly exceeded by its debts.

MAYFLOWER Corporation, the specialist motor engineering group, is to expand
its US operations through the purchase of an Ohio stamping facility for
Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 4.9m) cash.
It will use the facilities to produce steel and aluminium panels for truck
and niche car markets.
Mayflower already owns Motor Panels, the Coventry-headquartered concern
which claims to be the world's largest independent designer of truck cabs
and car and truck bodies.
Motor Panels supplies bodies for Jaguar, Rolls-Royce and Rover among others,
as well as truck cabs for Leyland DAF and Iveco Ford. Its Ohio and North
Caroliner-based subsidiary supplies cabs for Mack, Freightliner, Western
Star and Autocar trucks.
Mayflower said yesterday that its latest acquisition, the assets of
Shadyside Stamping Plant, of Shadyside, Ohio, would broaden its supply
capability to the US motor industry.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Body Shop shares hit as UK sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY SHOP International saw its share price drop by almost 9 per cent
yesterday after it reported disappointing pre-Christmas sales figures for
its UK stores.
In the wake of the announcement, which follows similarly disappointing
figures from a number of other high street retailers, analysts trimmed their
profit forecasts and the shares dropped 15p to 153p.
The group said UK sales fell by 8 per cent in the nine weeks to December 26
on a like-for-like basis - excluding the effects of shop openings and
closures while total UK sales were down 2 per cent.
However, US and international sales grew strongly reflecting the group's
expanding overseas business and investment. Sales in the US rose by 4 per
cent on a like-for-like basis and by 46 per cent in total, while
international sales grew by 2 per cent like-for-like and by 20 per cent in
total.
Commenting upon the figures, Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said: 'Christmas
was, in line with many other retailers, particularly late this year. There
was a marked contrast between disappointing sales in November and early
December, and the final few weeks of December.'
Mr Roddick said that in the UK, like-for-like sales increased by 4 per cent
over the three-week period to January 2. He noted that overseas retail sales
remained strong, but said 'it is too early to pick out a discernible trend
in the UK for the last two months of the year.'
However, analysts viewed the UK figures in particular as 'disappointing,'
and reduced their profit forecasts for the current year to between Pounds
20m and Pounds 22m, down from about Pounds 25m.
Some analysts have speculated that the decline in UK sales reflected the
impact of increased competition from more traditional retailers. Boots in
particular, has had success with its own-label range of Natural Collection
products and supermarket groups, such as J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway,
have also earmarked the personal care sector for growth.
Mr Roddick firmly rejected these suggestions yesterday. He said Body Shop's
independent research shows that UK customers are not going elsewhere,
instead he believes the downturn reflect the general economic recession,
which some analysts point out has hit the young particularly hard.

FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad bid referral urged to avert
travel duopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 215m bid for rival holiday company, Owners Abroad,
has met the first signs of formal opposition from consumer groups and
smaller tour operators.
The Consumers' Association is today writing to the Office of Fair Trading
requesting referral of the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
At the same time, Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of
Independent Tour Operators, has warned that 'the future of the travel
industry under a duopoly will be grim.'
He is particularly concerned about the future of Air 2000, Owners Abroad's
charter airline which, if absorbed by Airtours he argues, would reduce the
number of carriers available for smaller tour companies.
'This will be a serious blow to the independent tour operator and will lead
to further lack of choice and eventual control of the industry by one or two
major players,' Mr Josephides said.
If the bid succeeded, Airtours share of the UK market would approach the 33
per cent controlled by Thomson, which has dominated the industry for more
than a decade.
Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the Consumers' Association, said he
was less than optimistic that the bid would be referred to the MMC, given
that recent UK competition policy had been 'cloudy'.
But the referral was being requested on the grounds that Airtours would have
between 27 and 30 per cent of the holiday tour market, above the 25 per cent
figure that normally triggers an MMC investigation.
Airtours is not expecting the bid to be referred. It investigated the
likelihood of such a move before bidding.
Mr Josephides, whose organisation represents about 120 independent travel
groups, was also downbeat about the state of the holiday tour market.
'There is a mood of caution and pessimism in this, the most naively
optimistic of industries,' he said.
'The prices being charged for 1993 holidays are artificially and dangerously
low.'
Meanwhile, it emerged that Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland
Airways and a non-executive director of Airtours, holds 58,096 shares in
Owners Abroad.
The holding should have been declared when Airtours announced its bid last
week.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Exchange group faces difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE contraction in the London insurance market could pose particular
problems for Market Building, the consortium of 24 insurance companies which
has spearheaded the development of an insurance exchange for companies, the
London Underwriting Centre.
Market Building (MBL) has a 25-year lease on custom-built premises at 3
Minster Court in the City, which it is hoping to sub-let to several dozen
London market companies. The project, conceived in the booming market of the
late 1980s, has been dogged with difficulty.
A fire in August 1991 devastated the building's interior forcing an
expensive refit and an 18-month delay in its opening.
The collapse of the property market has led many prospective tenants to
rethink their original commitments, while others have withdrawn from the
market or folded.
As a result, when the LUC opens in October, Mr David Trace, MBL company
secretary, expects the building to be only 70 per cent let, with consortium
members themselves occupying about half the space. Before the fire, the LUC
had let 94 per cent of the building's 300,000 sq ft of available space.
So far MBL has been unable to persuade the Institute of London Underwriters,
which provides an exchange and back-up facilities for just under 100 marine
and aviation companies, to move from its premises on Leadenhall Street to
Minster Court.
Worse still, LUC is now in direct competition with Lloyd's, which over the
past few months has begun to invite companies to share its headquarters with
the underwriting syndicates which already transact business there. Five
companies - Anglo American, AIG, QBE, Liberty Mutual and National Reliance -
are already operating there. Up to 30 other companies have shown interest.
In 1992 MBL reduced its rental charges twice in a move to retain interest
from sub-tenants. It will now cost tenants Pounds 40 per sq ft (including
service charges), a cut of about a third from the original asking price.
That is still higher than market rents of Pounds 22 per square foot
available for office space within a stone's throw of the Lloyd's market.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Crisis reaches small insurance companies: Problems in
Lloyd's market have spread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE widely publicised problems of the Lloyd's insurance market have
distracted attention from the growing difficulties faced by many of London's
smaller insurance companies.
Over the past two years a dozen of the more than 100 'London market'
companies, which insure risk in the same way as syndicates at Lloyd's, have
been driven into insolvency by a wave of losses from catastrophes and US
pollution and asbestosis awards.
Many others have radically cut back their involvement in the specialised
marine, aviation, liability and reinsurance business and are drawing on the
resources of wealthier parent companies to meet heavy claims.
The attempt by Trinity Insurance, a general insurance company which
collapsed last year, to reach a new agreement with its creditors has
highlighted this growing crisis.
'Many companies are now under a level of duress never previously known . . .
several operations no longer appear to have the necessary critical mass for
the business they are in,' concluded Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency, last year.
Larger brokers are refusing to place business with companies which have
capital of less than Pounds 50m, says Ms Julianne Jessup, of De Lisle Jessup
Scott, the insurance consultancy.
'Brokers take the view that with the current unpredictability of claims
there isn't a big enough margin of error with the smaller companies,' said
Ms Jessup.
Mr Cliff Hampton, of Phoenix Securities, says that smaller companies are
missing out on better-quality business provided by the bigger brokers and
suffering worse underwriting results, and that many smaller companies may
merge.
There is scope for rationalisation, as 134 companies trading in London
(excluding the branches of foreign companies) in 1990 had average
shareholders' funds of only Pounds 16.6m each, according to S&amp;P, which adds
that the number of companies whose financial security is rated 'vulnerable'
has risen to 41 compared with 27 at the end of 1991.
Documents sent last week to creditors of Trinity Insurance said that
'imprudent' investments had contributed to Trinity's collapse last year. But
Mr John Winter, the company doctor who has superintended the company's
affairs over the past few months, says: 'Trinity would have had trouble
anyway simply because of its small capital base.'
He says 12 other insolvent London market insurance companies are likely to
follow Trinity's example and negotiate schemes of arrangement with creditors
and policyholders.
Schemes allow directors to remain in charge of companies during their
winding down under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner, avoiding
the need for a liquidation, which can delay payments to policyholders for
years.
Companies currently negotiating schemes include other small independent
companies such as Bryanston (a sister company of Trinity, also ultimately
owned by GFA Holdings), Andrew Weir, Chancellor, as well as a number of
subsidiaries of the London United Investments, the property-to-investment
group placed in administration early in 1990.
Mr Chris Keeling, deputy chairman of English &amp; American, another small
independent company, said he was forced to stop underwriting after its
backers - which include Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank - refused to inject
more capital. English &amp; American, whose management is highly regarded, saw
net assets dwindle to below Pounds 29m after losses on its marine cargo
account.
'In my view the days of the small independent London market company are
numbered,' said Mr Keeling.
Among subsidiaries of bigger European or US insurance companies to withdraw
are Orion, which is owned by the Dutch group ING, while NWRe, a London
market company jointly-owned by Norwich Union, Winterthur the Swiss company,
and Chiyoda of Japan has scaled back its involvement in the marine and some
other areas of the London market. The reinsurance subsidiaries of Royal
Insurance and Prudential are both cutting back on London market business.
Since the beginning of 1991 the Institute of London Underwriters, which
provides back-up services to companies specialising in marine, aviation and
transport insurance, has lost 19 of its 114 members.
Mr Anthony Funnell of the ILU expects the trend to continue and says that
increasingly companies with less than Pounds 20m in assets will find it
difficult to survive. 'It will be the survival of the biggest and the
fittest.'

FT  14 JAN 93 / VW approves DM76bn spending programme in spite of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading carmaker, is to press ahead with a heavy
investment programme in spite of the recession.
The group's supervisory board yesterday approved a five-year spending plan
that will inject almost DM76bn (Pounds 31bn) into the business by the end of
1997.
More than half, DM45.3bn, will be spent on the vehicles business, while the
rest will further bolster the group's leasing and sales financing arm,
estimated to have a 20 per cent share of the German leasing market alone.
An earlier expenditure programme for 1992-96 had earmarked DM51bn for
investment in vehicles.
A statement published after the meeting, the first under the guidance of Mr
Ferdinand Piech, group chairman since January 1, said adjustments were in
the light of the current economic situation.
All projects were under review, it added.
However, present difficulties appear to have damped only modestly the
group's plans, which include construction of a DM4.3bn plant in Mosel, a new
works in China and expansion of the Seat and Skoda subsidiaries.
Spending in vehicles divisions in this financial year will fall below DM9bn,
compared with DM9.9bn last time, the company said, but rise later to average
more than DM9m a year.
There was no mention of further job cuts or other economies, widely expected
after Volkswagen's slump into loss in the fourth quarter of last year,
warnings of a dividend cut, and company forecasts of a 20 per cent fall in
domestic demand for cars this year.
The group, which employs 273,000 worldwide, cut almost 7,000 jobs last year,
pruned planned investment spending by DM3bn, and imposed extensive
short-time working at the turn of the year. The likelihood of a further
30,000 job cuts by the end of next year, as suggested in some reports, is
still unclear.
The supervisory board also appointed Mr Martin Poth, personnel director, to
a newly created role as board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific
region.
Volkswagen shares closed down DM4.40 at DM258.50 in Frankfurt before the
outcome of yesterday's meeting was known.

FT  14 JAN 93 / BAe set to sign joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace is on the verge of finalising a Pounds 240m joint venture
with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture and develop regional jets.
The agreement, which is fundamental to the restructuring and recovery
strategy of BAe's loss-making civil aircraft business, is expected to be
signed at the end of this week or next week at the latest.
BAe confirmed that its talks with Taiwan Aerospace were making 'good
progress', while Mr George Liu, Taiwan Aerospace's vice-president, was
quoted by the Taiwan Economic Daily News as saying a final agreement with
BAe would be signed on Friday.
The deal is particularly important for BAe because it will secure the future
of its regional jet activities and unlock the next stage of the company's
civil aircraft restructuring.
BAe has also decided to keep its Space Systems division which the company
had earlier planned to shed as part of its overall restructuring.
The decision follows BAe's rejection of a bid from Matra Marconi Space, the
space partnership between the UK General Electric Company and Matra of
France. BAe and Matra Marconi failed to agree on a valuation for the BAe
space business.
Aerospace analysts yesterday said the Taiwan deal would enable BAe to
release a large amount of provisions to help accelerate this reorganisation.
Taiwan Aerospace is expected to pay BAe about Pounds 120m for its 50 per
cent share in the joint venture. The deal will also help preserve the
residual value of existing BAe-146 regional jet aircraft.
About 200 BAe-146 aircraft are in service of which many are leased by BAe to
airline customers. The value of these aircraft would have collapsed if BAe
had been forced to close down 146 production.
Under the agreement, BAe's new Regional Jet (RJ) range of aircraft will be
jointly produced at BAe's Woodford plant, near Manchester, and in Taiwan.
The first RJ aircraft partly assembled in Taiwan is expected to be delivered
in the next 12 months.
Once the Taiwan deal has been finalised, BAe is likely to seek an
international partner to invest in its turbopropeller commuter aircraft
business to mirror the Taiwan joint venture.

FT  14 JAN 93 / DTB and Matif in co-operation agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF Europe's largest futures exchanges, Germany's Deutsche Terminborse
and France's Matif, have agreed to link their markets, in the most
significant co-operation pact yet between exchanges.
Under the agreement, members of the DTB will be able to trade the Matif's
Ecu contracts, while Matif members will have access to the DTB's important
D-Mark interest rate contracts.
The link between the French and German market could help to draw business
away from the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), which
last year was Europe's most active futures market.
The agreement offers the DTB an opportunity to increase its market share in
German bund future trading, which is dominated by Liffe with around 70 per
cent of the market.
The Matif will also acquire the DTB's computerised trading system, which
will initially be used for trading its Ecu products.
Faced with increasing competition from over-the-counter products developed
by banks, futures exchanges have become increasingly keen to co-operate.
Technological advances have enabled traders around the world to come
together on screen-based systems, while the breakdown of barriers between
markets has spurred investor demand for a broader range of products.
Last year, four other European exchanges formed an alliance, First European
Exchanges (FEX), to extend the customer base for their contracts. Liffe is
continuing discussions with the Chicago Board of Trade to list some of each
others' products.
The Matif's decision to move products on to the DTB's computerised system
was influenced by the cost of trading less active contracts using the
traditional open-outcry method. New products may later be launched jointly,
or existing products added to the agreement.
The Matif said the link will have no impact on its agreement to join Globex,
the international after-hours trading system developed by the Chicago Board
of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. The DTB is still in
discussions with Globex. The Matif/DTB agreement is potentially open to
other exchanges, of which the Netherlands' European Options Exchange is
believed to be the most likely candidate.

FT  14 JAN 93 / GPA seeks extension of waivers on borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the aircraft leasing group, is to ask its banks to extend temporary
waivers to a potential breach of borrowing covenants because of a delay in
its debt rescheduling agreement.
After a meeting yesterday of its key lenders, several banks involved in the
restructuring talks said there was unlikely to be an agreement on debt
rescheduling and a permanent change in covenants until February at the
earliest.
The group had hoped that its bankers would be able to agree to defer up to
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) of debt repayments by mid-January. However, a GPA
spokesman said its original plan did not envisage its refinancing strategy
being completed until the end of the first quarter of 1993.
The banks are expected to agree to the extension of the temporary waivers,
although some have expressed concern that the negotiations are taking longer
than expected.
GPA, which has total debts of Dollars 5bn, including bank borrowings of more
than Dollars 3bn, needs a two-thirds majority of the banks - measured by
loans - for the borrowing changes. Negotiations between GPA and the aircraft
manufacturers are continuing.
The company has reached agreement to reduce its firm orders by more than
Dollars 6bn, although the resulting penalties may adversely affect its
results in 1993 and later years.
It no longer expects to conclude talks this week.
Talks with aircraft manufacturers and bankers are conditional upon reaching
an agreement with shareholders to raise new equity.

FT  14 JAN 93 / British soldier killed in Bosnia on convoy duty: UK to send
back-up forces to protect troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH soldier was killed in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, the first
British army fatality since troops joined the humanitarian aid effort in the
former Yugoslav republic.
The British government said UK forces would continue to supply humanitarian
aid for the victims of the civil war in Bosnia, backed by reinforcements
expected to be agreed by the British cabinet today.
The soldier was killed while accompanying a convoy along the route between
the Croatian coastal town of Split and Vitez in Bosnia.
The cabinet is due to agree on the dispatch of extra forces to back up the
UK's 2,400 troops in Bosnia, principally to increase protection for UK
soldiers.
Plans under discussion involve sending the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to the
Adriatic with Harrier jets and Sea King helicopters, as well as an artillery
battery to strengthen the capacity of British UN forces to respond to
attack.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said Lance Corporal Wayne Edwards, 26,
'has lost his life in working to save the lives of many others'. Downing
Street said the risks of British involvement in Bosnia had never been
underestimated.
Officials said the twin-track strategy of helping victims of the civil war
while insisting that long-term peace in former Yugoslavia required a
negotiated settlement would continue. 'It is clear that we will carry on
providing humanitarian aid,' the prime minister's office said.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said British troops had saved many lives
in the region, besides escorting 147 convoys delivering a total of 12,000
tonnes of humanitarian aid.
European Community foreign ministers last night held an emergency meeting in
Paris to discuss Bosnia and the apparent breakthrough on Tuesday night at
the Geneva peace talks. They gave Bosnia's Serbs six days to accept
unconditionally the peace plan or face additional punitive measures by the
UN.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said the EC would start
next week preparing plans to seal Serbia's borders, to set up a UN war
crimes tribunal, and to enforce no-fly zones over Bosnia. Mr Hans van den
Broek, EC external affairs commissioner, discussed with ministers the early
dispatch of observers to Serbia's neighbours, including Greece, to prepare
for stiffer sanctions.
Both men had earlier said the EC had to be ready to pursue the 'total
isolation' of Serbia if aggression against Bosnia continued. The Danish
foreign minister ruled out massive military intervention in former
Yugoslavia as 'not credible'.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was last night due in
Belgrade, the Serbian capital. He will put the Geneva peace plan to his
parliament.

FT  14 JAN 93 / ICI may pay less for electricity to safeguard chlorine
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to allow Imperial Chemical Industries to buy
electricity at cheaper rates than other UK industrial users in an attempt to
safeguard its chlorine business.
The move should secure 7,000 jobs at ICI's chlor-alkali plant at Runcorn,
Cheshire. PowerGen, the generating group, would be offered a licence to
supply electricity directly to the plant.
The proposals follow threats by ICI last year to abandon its chlorine
business unless it could secure supplies of cheap power. If ICI abandoned
chlorine production to foreign competition, it estimates the impact on the
UK balance of trade would be Pounds 1.5bn.
The group, which currently buys electricity from a spot market, experienced
sharply higher power costs following the industry's privatisation. ICI's
chlorine-based plants at Runcorn are the UK's largest consumers of
electricity - capable of using 250MW, equivalent to 1 per cent of the UK's
entire output.
The Department of Trade and Industry must now decide whether other large
industrial users should benefit from similar licences. Mr Peter Rost,
chairman of the Major Energy Users' Council, said he would want to assess
why ICI should be a special case, according to The Engineer, a specialist
magazine. Blue Circle Industries, the UK's largest cement manufacturer, and
British Steel are likely to want similar deals.
The DTI's proposals would allow PowerGen's Ince power-station near Runcorn
to supply the chlor-alkali plant directly. Ince is fuelled by oil or
Venezuelan bitumen. ICI would prefer to use the Fiddler's Ferry 2,000MW
plant five miles from Runcorn, which produces cheap electricity from coal.
The company has been paying up to Pounds 31 a megawatt hour for electricity
compared with under Pounds 20 before privatisation. Electricity now accounts
for about 70 per cent of the variable costs of ICI's chlorine production. In
November, ICI said it had given itself three months to sort out the problem.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Outburst exposes rift between Bundesbank and Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION within the German economic policymaking establishment unexpectedly
burst into the open yesterday when one of the most senior officials in the
Bonn finance ministry publicly criticised the Bundesbank for not caring
enough about slow growth and rising unemployment.
Mr Horst Kohler, the finance ministry state secretary, told a meeting of
international officials and bankers that the Bonn government was worried
about the capacity of western democracies to live with persistently high
unemployment. In an unscripted aside, he then said world growth and high
unemployment should be considered more in central bank council meetings.
His remarks, clearly aimed at the German central bank's high interest rates,
caused an audible intake of breath at yesterday's meeting of the G7 Council,
a non-profitmaking body that promotes debate on international finance and
trade issues.
The finance ministry's impatience with the independent Bundesbank's monetary
policy may have reflected different assessments of Germany's growth outlook.
Mr Kohler said he 'did not exclude the possibility of negative growth' in
Germany this year.
By contrast, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said there was
'no reason for dramatising the situation' and forecast increased economic
activity from the middle of 1993.
Bundesbank officials did not respond directly to Mr Kohler's outburst - that
was left to Mr Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank president, who
reminded Mr Kohler that by law the Bundesbank was obliged to give a higher
priority to attaining price stability than achieving full employment.
In separate speeches, both Mr Helmut Schlesinger and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his
deputy, stressed that the Bundesbank could not be blamed for Germany's high
interest rates. These were the result of excessively high wage settlements
and Germany's inability so far to control its public sector deficits.
In their defence, Mr Schlesinger and Mr Tietmeyer pointed out that Germany's
long-term interest rates were below their average level for the past 25
years at around 7 per cent. Mr Schlesinger also indicated that the
Bundesbank was prepared to operate its monetary policy flexibly, as shown by
last week's decision to ease its money market rates to 8.6 per cent.
Speaking after gross domestic product figures showed a decline in German
economic activity in the second half of 1992, Mr Schlesinger insisted:
'Monetary policy should not be turned into a pacemaker for efforts to
kickstart economic activity.'
Yesterday's spat between Frankfurt and Bonn contrasted with a mood of
harmony among European central bankers.

FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: First Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many companies have come through the recession with gearing of just 12
per cent and pre-tax margins of 29 per cent. That First Leisure has managed
to do so testifies to the quality of a management that refused to be seduced
by the deceptively easy opportunities of the late 1980s. But it also
suggests First Leisure may be an innately cautious company which will be
slow to exploit the recovery. The question matters because First Leisure is
approaching the time when it will have to rely on more than just organic
growth to justify a historic multiple of 21.
Investors might be willing to forgive the poor outlook for earnings this
year. Not only will the pace of site openings slow; the company will also
face an increase in its tax rate that was held down to an abnormally low 20
per cent in 1991-92 as a result of unclaimed capital allowances. A spate of
site openings around the end of the current year and, presumably, some
economic recovery should see a return to a more robust growth rate in
1993-94. First Leisure is also now well placed to take advantage of cheap
property prices in the southeast to expand in a region which has hitherto
seemed too expensive.
That will still leave only limited growth prospects. First Leisure needs
something more. Bingo seems the most likely possibility, but it will not be
easy. Bass and Rank dominate the business. Neither is likely to prove a
willing seller, which seems to block the acquisition route. Both would
surely move to counter any competitive threat even if this were confined to
under-exploited 'out-of-town' sites. First Leisure cannot prevaricate
indefinitely, though, if it wants to outperform.

FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop appears in dire need of one of its famously soothing lotions as it
continues to ooze bad trading news. The worrying aspect is that much of its
weakness appears particular to itself. Body Shop reported a 2 per cent
decline in UK sales in the nine weeks before Christmas; its rival, Boots,
increased sales of its comparable Natural Collection range by 30 per cent in
its final quarter. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Body Shop's high
prices are wildly out of line with those of its competitors. Sales are
suffering as a result. In the aberrant 1980s, retailers might have got away
with selling high volumes of high margin goods. In the current climate, they
are only likely to make their sums add up if they sell high volumes of low
margin goods or vice versa.
Body Shop can recover. The fundamental business is sound enough.
International opportunities are still considerable, while its customer
appeal remains strong. Its strategic review may well throw up enough
innovative ideas to reshape the business. Nevertheless, the days of
extraordinary growth must surely have ended - although the market still does
not seem fully to appreciate the fact. At more than 20 times consensus
forecast earnings, Body Shop's rating may no longer be extravagant; just
plain expensive.

FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Futures Exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's agreement between the Paris and Frankfurt futures exchanges
suggests there are still too many European markets chasing too little
liquidity. Even without monetary union, the existence of more than 20
independent exchanges seems hard to justify. If the Ecu ever makes the grade
as a common currency, instruments denominated in D-Marks or guilders will be
an anachronism. By banding together last year, four of the smaller fry
recognised as much. Unlike that alliance, a partnership of Europe's second
and third largest exchanges could mount a credible challenge to Liffe.
There is plenty of scope for disappointment. Matif and DTB have yet to
thrash out much detail. If the Franco-German alliance ever reaches fruition,
though, the exchanges will be trading the same contracts on a common
screen-based system with compatible arrangements for clearing and the like.
Since the success of any contract turns on its ability to attract liquidity,
Liffe would then be hard pressed to maintain its enviable record of
capturing market share.
All the more so if other exchanges join up too. Having put the DTB's nose
out of joint with the success of its German bond future - and won more than
one head-to-head contest with the Matif - that route is hardly open to
Liffe. Its international membership and faith in open-outcry trading have
traditionally pulled the crowds. Splendid isolation may be more difficult to
justify.

Dixons must wonder when its American nightmare will end. The Dollars 320m
(Pounds 210m) purchase of the US Silo chain in 1987 has proved a terrible
folie de grandeur. Even the company has now given up pretending it has the
answer. It is closing some stores in middle America, tinkering with new
retailing ideas and replacing the US management, but it will be at least a
year before Dixons itself knows whether it has a business worth
resuscitating. Meanwhile, there are alarming signs that the company's touch
has not improved. Silo is moving into the highly competitive home office
equipment market where margins are slim. It also intends to confront the
likes of Circuit City head on in the big cities, when it is at least
arguable that it has a better chance of making money in the backwoods.
Besides, there is also an uncomfortable sense that Dixons would close the
whole operation if only it could afford it. Unfortunately that would cut
fixed assets by almost half, severely straining the balance sheet. The
alternative is at least a five-year haul, with endless management time being
wasted, the majority of shops being moved and more money being poured into
new fittings.
The drag on the shares caused by the US fiasco can only be made worse by the
worry that Silo's losses may increase. At least Dixons has its UK business
to keep it warm, but even the expected rebound in earnings as the economy
recovers may not be as sustainable as it looks. Dixons earns substantial
profits from highly optional warranty premiums, and import price increases
may well deter buyers, however hard the industry tries to bamboozle
customers with changing model specifications.

FT  14 JAN 93 / How to redress the banks' balance: UK clearers must reform
if they are to regain small business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether Britain's many ailing small businesses have been more demoralised by
the insensitive behaviour of the UK clearing banks or by the government's
management of the economy is a moot point.
However, the chancellor has the opportunity to redeem himself in the coming
fortnight, when he publishes his recommendations on how the small business
loan market might be improved.
The Treasury's review of this market began two months ago. It was triggered
by widespread complaints by small companies that banks have caused needless
damage by arbitrarily depriving them of credit or charging them too much for
loans and other services. Mr Lamont, the chancellor, now has the submissions
from most big banks and has also received the conclusions of a Bank of
England study of interest rates and charges levied on small businesses.
His original fear, that banks have not been passing on the benefit of base
rate reductions to their small business customers, appears to have been
unfounded. The Bank has concluded that lending margins - the difference
between the base rate and rates charged to customers - have not changed
significantly, though some banks have enjoyed a slight margin improvement.
A small increase in margins might indeed have been justified. The risk of
lending to small business rises in a recession, so perhaps banks should be
rewarded for carrying this increased risk.
On the other hand, banks have pushed up fees and commissions very sharply.
New research by the analyst Terry Smith shows that the volume of banking
transactions, such as cheque clearing, has stagnated over the past couple of
years. But banks' revenue from fees and commissions on these transactions
has been rising at 20 per cent a year - most of which is due to an increase
in tariffs for all customers and the introduction of new tariffs.
To a certain extent, the banks' imposition of new tariffs is to be welcomed.
It is a sign that they are belatedly setting their charges at levels which
correspond to the costs of providing particular services.
However, the ability of the banks to raise their tariffs during a recession
indicates there may be too little competition between them. Such a situation
is a particular defect of the small business market, in which there are no
more than 10 serious providers of loans. Just two banks, National
Westminster and Barclays, have about half the market.
The government's ability to alter the competitive environment is limited,
though. In other industries it could perhaps launch a Monopolies Commission
inquiry to assess whether the leading players should reduce their market
shares by making disposals. However, to shed all or part of small business
lending is next to impossible. No bank would buy a portfolio of small
business loans from a rival without obtaining a close knowledge of the
borrowers - and acquiring that knowledge is an arduous and time-consuming
process.
There are two other criticisms of banks which stick. Too often, they have
withdrawn credit from particular customers for no good reason. In addition,
they have also made mistakes, such as imposing charges when none was due.
Personal customers can seek redress for banking errors by complaining to the
banking ombudsman. Unincorporated businesses may also go to the ombudsman,
though few are probably aware of their right to do so. But incorporated
businesses can only seek redress in the courts, which is often a
prohibitively expensive route.
The Treasury is likely to recommend the creation of an ombudsman scheme for
all small businesses, incorporated or unincorporated. It should have three
roles:
Like the existing ombudsman, it should adjudicate on complaints about
alleged banking mistakes and impose reparations.
When a complaint is not about a mistake but about the fairness of a bank's
actions - in, for example, withdrawing credit or imposing heavy new charges
 -the ombudsman should conduct a review and publish the conclusions. There
would be no power to force a bank to reverse its decision. However, few
banks would be likely to ignore the ombudsman's recommendation.
The ombudsman should carry out an annual review of banks' lending and
charging policies in general. This increase in market transparency would
compensate for the lack of competition.
The immediate reaction of most banks is to fight the creation of such an
institution. However, they are wrong to do so. If the banks are to regain
public confidence, they must be prepared to explain their policies and
actions in public.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Gulf war revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS AMERICAN, British and French warplanes went into action against Iraq last
night, nobody should have been less surprised than President Saddam Hussein.
In recent days the Iraqi leader has been doing more than testing the
patience of Washington and its allies. By repeatedly sending men into what
the United Nations now recognises as Kuwaiti territory, barring UN weapons
inspectors from his soil and violating the no-fly zones established in the
north and south of his country, he has been actively courting attack. The
west had no alternative but to mount a vigorous but measured response.
In embarking on this course, however, the allies can be under no illusions
as to their objectives and their chances of success.
The only satisfactory outcome, for the west, for Iraq's neighbours and for
the long-suffering Iraqi people, would be the result they hoped for after
the humiliating defeat they inflicted on Saddam two years ago: his speedy
removal from power and the emergence of a regime prepared to respect the
terms of the Gulf ceasefire and the will of the international community.
This week's onslaught thus needs to form part of a sustained campaign of
attrition, in which, without warning, every fresh Iraqi offence provokes
strikes against the military and political apparatus that sustains his rule.
Even so, there is no guarantee that Saddam's removal is within the allies'
grasp, any more than it proved after thousands of allied bombing sorties
crippled Iraq's infrastructure and killed or wounded tens of thousands of
Iraqis. On the contrary: such is the ruin that Saddam has brought on his
country in eight years of war with Iran and in his foolish adventure in
Kuwait that he now perversely needs confrontation with an external enemy to
preserve his rule.
Two and a half years of sanctions may have caused untold suffering among
ordinary Iraqis, but they have given Saddam a ready-made explanation for the
country's economic plight. He must likewise be calculating that a new
western onslaught will burnish his propaganda in Iraq and in the wider Arab
world.
It is going to be a long haul, and one fraught with political pitfalls for
the allies - not least in their dealings with other Arab governments. But
even if the result is only Saddam's containment, rather than removal, the
west is condemned to persevere.

The first, a 50 per cent pay rise, produced no reaction whatsoever. Neither

'What, every Friday?' he said.

Few ex-diplomats can have picked up as many advisory jobs in such a short
space of time as Sir John Whitehead, Britain's ambassador to Japan for six
years until his retirement last summer.
He has set up office at Morgan Grenfell, where he's a senior adviser, and is
also advising the president of the Board of Trade and the Welsh Development
Agency. Last week Guinness made him its international affairs adviser, and
yesterday it was Inchcape's turn to recruit him as adviser on Japanese
affairs. It seems that Cable and Wireless is about to hire him, too.
Since he was dashing for a flight to Japan at the start of a packed
three-week programme, he didn't have time to answer Observer's query about
how many more such juicy jobs he planned to take. But it sounds as though he
already has enough on his plate, if he's going to give value for money.

Bob Phillis and Liz Forgan haven't even arrived at the BBC yet, but that has
not stopped their futures being mapped out. Phillis, the 47-year-old ITN
boss, who takes over as deputy director-general, is only one year younger
than John Birt, the new director-general. But he is already being seen as
Birt's natural successor.
The precedents are already well established. The last two deputy DGs, Birt
and Sir Michael Checkland, went on to get the top job. Liz Forgan, 48, who
comes from Channel 4 to be managing director of BBC Radio, would - after a
spell in BBC Television - be well placed to become the first woman to make
it to deputy DG.
Such changes may not be as far away as some appear to suspect. John Birt is
unlikely to stay longer than his five-year term.
Once the place is restructured and the BBC's Royal Charter is renewed in
1996, Big Brother Birt will want to be off in search of new conquests.

Meanwhile allusions to alcoholic as well as financial liquidity have crept
into the row over whether recession is being prolonged by the Bundesbank's

Vice-president Tietmeyer says he has no qualms about the high interest
rates, which have nothing to do with sluggish economic growth.
But he does object to being referred to publicly as one of a 'super-tight

FT  14 JAN 93 / Observer: Jaws in line for vice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Temperatures are rising at the Bundesbank. Besides the strains of defending
unpopular policies, it has the small worry of who will succeed Hans
Tietmeyer as the German central bank's vice-president when he steps up to
replace Helmut Schlesinger in the coming summer.
One likely candidate, evidently allowed a much higher profile recently, is
loquacious Reimut 'Jaws' Jochimsen, president of the Dusseldorf regional
central bank and a former economics minister for North Rhine- Westphalia.
The 59-year-old won attention in Britain four months back when the text of
one of his speeches turned out to contain remarks - withdrawn before he
spoke - that the principal obstacle to an EMS realignment was 'prestige'.
Black Wednesday was not far behind.
An ex-academic whose views defy easy categorisation, he is variously
described by domestic and foreign commentators as a hawk or a dove on the
one hand, and as pro- or anti-European on the other. But as he's a staunch
SPD member, his politics certainly fit - redressing the balance after the
solid rightwing bias at the top since Karl Otto Pohl resigned.
Bundesbank-watchers say Jochimsen was limbering up for the vice-presidency
during last week's council meeting, at which as many as six members
apparently voted for rate cuts, leaving only a three-strong majority for no
change. Jochimsen acted as the conciliator and is credited with engineering
the eventual compromise of nudging down money-market rather than official
rates.
Nice to think that the Bundesbank's already highly delicate task is being
complicated by further personality games.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Leading Article: City regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION IS rising in the retail investment industry over reform of the
regulatory bodies responsible for marketing life assurance, pensions and
unit trusts. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the top regulatory organisation,
the Securities and Investments Board, has fired a shot across the bows of
the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulating body
designed to absorb two existing regulators, Lautro and Fimbra. In the
background is a critical, unpublished Office of Fair Trading report on life
assurance marketing.
The PIA, as so far outlined, certainly takes practitioner-based regulation
beyond the limits of practicality. Its 30-member board, big enough to
include all the warring factions within the investment industry, must be cut
down by half and rebalanced in favour of public interest representatives,
says Mr Large. There must be no rubber-stamp transfer of existing Fimbra
members to the PIA. Nor can this be a cut-price regulator; it must be one
able to deal with rising compensation claims and widespread concerns about
the industry's marketing practices.
The sting in the tail of the Mr Large's letter to Sir Gordon Downey,
prospective PIA chairman, is the warning that the SIB has alternatives up
its sleeve should the PIA collapse. This is plainly intended to strengthen
Sir Gordon's hand in overcoming industry resistance to toughening the PIA's
prospectus. The British Insurance Association, for instance, was quick to
issue an angry response yesterday about 'moving the goalposts'.
But it would be a pity if Mr Large's threats were dismissed as negotiator's
bluff. It is time that the alternatives were spelt out more clearly. Some in
the industry have already called for direct statutory regulation of the
marketing of investment products. Alternatively, Fimbra could be absorbed
within a strengthened Lautro, and independent financial advisers would have
to become tied agents except where they could obtain authorisation through
professional bodies.
It is right that Mr Large should tackle the vested interests in investment
retailing which the consensus-seeking SIB has treated far too leniently in
the past. However, this is not a private debate, but one of wide public
interest, and it is time that the issues were brought out into the open.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Peace wins an 11th-hour reprieve: A last-minute turnround by
Bosnia's Serbs has brought hope to the Geneva talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular turnround by the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic,
at the Geneva peace talks on Bosnia has, for the first time in many months,
brought a glimmer of hope that a solution to that bloody conflict is on the
horizon. Yet in spite of the conditional agreement on a future
constitutional framework for Bosnia that was reached on Tuesday, only the
most incurable optimist could ignore the very big obstacles to a
comprehensive peace settlement that still lie ahead.
The very fact that it required the combined forces of three presidents - Mr
Dobrica Cosic of the rump federation of Yugoslavia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia and Mr Momir Bulatovic of Montenegro - to change Mr Karadzic's mind
on the international mediators' proposals showed how difficult he found that
decision.
Even then, Mr Karadzic considered it necessary to shift the responsibility
for his acceptance of the plan, tabled early this month by Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen, to the Bosnian Serbian assembly, which has either to approve
or reject it within seven days. In spite of Mr Karadzic's optimism that it
will do so - the Bosnian Serb leader's forecasts have frequently proved to
be inaccurate in the past - there is absolutely no guarantee. It was, after
all, the Bosnian Serb parliament which rejected the Vance-Owen plan in the
first place and gave Mr Karadzic a mandate for intransigence at the Geneva
talks which, until his last-minute turnabout, he respected to the letter.
The best hope that the Bosnian Serb assembly will, in the last resort,
swallow the constitutional principles, already formally endorsed by the
Bosnian Croats and, in principle, by the Moslems, again lies in the pressure
that can be exerted by Mr Milosevic and Mr Cosic, particularly the former.
Mr Milosevic was invited to the last round of the Geneva talks by the two
co-chairmen, in spite of his bad international reputation, in the hope that
he could repeat his peace-making performance of January last year. On that
occasion, he brokered a ceasefire agreement between Serbs and Croats, which
opened the way to the presence of the United Nations Protection Force in
disputed areas. It was a considerable achievement which has since been
obscured by the continued fighting and slaughter which has cost some 17,000
lives in Bosnia.
Notwithstanding scepticism about Mr Milosevic's fundamental desire to act as
a mediator, he came up with the goods, albeit after the plenary negotiations
had already broken down. In subsequent bilateral meetings with Mr Karadzic,
Mr Milosevic and Mr Cosic are reported to have made it clear that they
considered a peace settlement to be in the interests of Serbia, whose
rapidly deteriorating economic situation could only be improved by a lifting
of international sanctions. The Serbian president is also understood to have
stressed that, if the Bosnian Serbs dug in their heels and became involved
in a military conflict with western nations, they could not necessarily
count on Belgrade's support.
The implicit threat that Belgrade might cut the Bosnian Serbs' life-line by
withdrawing military and economic support is Mr Milosevic's most powerful
card, if he is prepared to play it. The fact that both Mr Milosevic and Mr
Cosic have expressed their intention to defend their views personally before
the Bosnian Serb assembly is a further indication that they are serious in
their support for the mediation effort.
Mr Karadzic's last-minute change of heart was announced not by himself, but
in a communique issued by Mr Cosic's spokesman, which made clear that his
decision had been made on 'the insistence' of the three presidents. This
eloquently underlines the nature of the pressure that was exerted. It is the
first time that any kind of rift has appeared in the greater Serbian camp
and that must be considered good news for the peace process in the former
Yugoslavia.
Mr Karadzic, of course, has tried to make the best of a bad job by stressing
that the co-chairmen's 'revised' proposals have fully taken into account his
demands, repeatedly proclaimed throughout the negotiations since they
started two weeks ago. Specifically, he claimed that the proposed division
of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces would be tantamount
to creating a system under which there would be 'many states within a
state', thus giving the Bosnian Serbs virtual independence in both domestic
and foreign affairs.
That is precisely what Mr Vance and Lord Owen have studiously avoided in
their constitutional plan for an independent and sovereign
Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose territorial integrity will be guaranteed. Though
their proposals make clear that the provinces of the new decentralised state
will be largely self-governing for internal affairs, they emphasise that the
provinces 'shall not have any international legal personality and may not
enter into agreements with foreign states or international organisations'.
In other words, the Serbian provinces will not be able to decide separately
on their links with Serbia, let alone on secession from Bosnia-Hercegovina
to join a greater Serbia. Such a constitutional provision would have been
rejected outright by the Bosnian Moslems and is also unacceptable to the
international community as a whole.
The only minor concession that the co-chairmen made to Mr Karadzic's views
was to condense two of the articles of their original 10-point
constitutional framework. They amalgamated article 4, which states that the
new constitution will recognise three 'constituent peoples', with article 1,
specifying that Bosnia-Hercegovina shall be a decentralised state made up of
largely self-governing provinces.
This modification has given the concept of constituent peoples (Serbs,
Moslems and Croats) greater prominence by moving it up to the top of the
text of the constitution, but the substance of the document has not been
altered. Mr Karadzic has signally failed in his bid to gain recognition for
'the three major ethnic groups as the constituent units of state', a formula
which, in the eyes of the co-chairmen and Bosnian Moslems, would have opened
the door to the eventual creation of an independent Bosnian Serb state. Mr
Vance and Mr Owen have repeatedly made it clear to Mr Karadzic that the
provision for semi-autonomous provinces in their proposals offer the Bosnian
Serbs all the guarantees they need to preserve their identity.
Yet even if the Bosnian Serb assembly endorses the new constitutional
framework, that would leave some substantial hurdles still to be negotiated
on the road to a comprehensive peace settlement. The mediators' package
contains two other important elements: an agreement on the actual boundaries
of the new provinces and an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and
the pull-back of troops.
It is widely recognised that the first of these will be extremely difficult
to negotiate, given both the Serbs' demand for a corridor across the north
of Bosnia which would link up the territories assigned to them, and Moslem
demands for various adjustments to the proposed boundaries and a greater
share of the total area of the new state.
By contrast, there is already a wide measure of agreement on the military
aspects of a peace settlement, with even Mr Karadzic, it is said, prepared
to accept that the future Bosnia-Hercegovina should be demilitarised and
Sarajevo declared an 'open city'. Be that as it may, the Bosnian Serb leader
has already made it clear that he is opposed to the proposal under which all
heavy weapons of the combatants would be placed under UN control or
supervision.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen have already shown that they are up to the task of
overcoming even these complicated remaining problems. This week, when they
were playing for very high stakes, the co-chairmen proved themselves to be
poker players of the highest calibre. What they will find very difficult to
do, however, is to deliver an agreement which will be fully implemented by
all the parties. Too often, Bosnian peace hopes have been dashed. It is the
durability of the Vance-Owen plan that will be its ultimate test.

Sir, It was depressing to read that the City Corporation is once again
preparing to compromise London's diminishing built heritage, for a paltry
300,000 pieces of more than somewhat devalued silver ('Road in City to be
sold', January 12).
The last such occasion that professionally concerned me was the City
Corporation's sale to the London Docklands Development corporation of the
unique late 19th and early 20th century group of industrial buildings at St
George's Wharf, Deptford, which was then destroyed (in advance of possible
spot-listing) to make way for an unnecessarily elaborate feeder road and a
currently weed-encrusted 'development opportunity'.
Now Bucklersbury is likely to be similarly ripped up to make way for some
seedy 'arcade' (doubtless to be filled by unlettable retail premises)
running through what Prince Charles has rightly referred to as a 1930s
'wireless set', although, in the current climate, about the only way Lord
Palumbo will be able to fund its construction will be by emptying his own
pockets] We should expect a better standard of care for our heritage from
what is virtually the only efficient UK local authority. Brian H Gill,

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At the summit in Edinburgh the statesmen of the European Community
undermined the foundation of the EC by granting Denmark exceptions.
Copenhagen was successful in securing the requested exclusions - that is, a
clear distinction between Danish citizenship and union citizenship, no
adhesion to the third round of monetary union, and keeping its distance from
the EC defence policy.
One member of the EC has been released from unconditionally signing the
Maastricht treaty, a document that was considered to be the crowning of the
EC. In Edinburgh, the fundamental rule - same rights, same duties - has been
once more sacrificed. At the end of the summit the leaders stated
triumphantly that the EC has shown its ability to act efficiently - an
activity likely to bring the bureaucratic monster closer to failure.
What's in store for the future? The UK has its own opt-outs, and will ask
for similar or the same exceptions as Denmark. The other 10 EC members will
thus feel duped and prejudiced. They will become aware that an unconditional
Yes to the Maastricht treaty was the biggest mistake they ever made.
There are already many symptoms of crisis of the Community - trade
disagreements with other great powers (such as the Gatt conflict between the
Community and US) and a proliferation of internal quarrels (there were more
than 900 infringements of member states last year), to mention only two of
the main calamities. To add to this, now comes a Maastricht treaty with
numerous holes in it.
The European Community will remain a fragile torso unless it is remodelled
in a federalistic, democratic European commonwealth, governed (as Nobel
prize-winner Maurice Allais recently suggested) by a constitution like the
one of Switzerland.

My inclination had been to shrug off most of this talk as a reflection of
the jaundiced attitude towards capitalism of the chattering classes on both
sides of the Atlantic. Closer investigation has impelled me to believe that
there is something in the complaints; but that there is little Clinton can
do to remedy matters. Indeed, the changes are an aspect of the reduction of
income differences between American citizens and their geographical
neighbours, which progressive politicians ought to welcome but seldom do.
A standard analysis of the labour market data appears in an article by F
Levy and R J Murnane in the September 1992 issue of the Journal of Economic
Literature (JEL). The authors' starting point is that real income per
full-time employee was rising by 2.45 per cent per annum between 1947 and
1975, but by only 0.67 per cent in the 1973-88 period.
The real median income of a 45-54-year-old man (this means that he is in the
middle of the income distribution) rose by more than 20 per cent in the
decade to 1958, nearly 41 per cent in the decade to 1968, and by only 1 or 2
per cent in the decade to 1988.
The near standstill in hourly pay is clearly associated with the
much-discussed productivity slowdown. President George Bush's outgoing
Council of Economic Advisers has suggested that a change of gear has taken
place, from an underlying 3 per cent annual growth in business sector output
per hour up to the early 1970s to 0.9 per cent since then.
The squeeze on hourly pay has not been reflected nearly as much in
disposable income and spending. Higher participation rates have helped
family income. There has also been an increase in the share of property or
non-wage receipts such as property returns or social security payments.
According to the orthodox tabulations, not only did pay grow more slowly in
recent years; but there was among male, although not female, workers a
pro-cess known as polarisation or 'hollowing out'. The proportion increased
of relatively highly paid men earning more than Dollars 40,000 in dollars of
constant 1988 value. But so did the proportion at the bottom end, earning
less than Dollars 20,000. It was the numbers in between that fell.
The near standstill in earnings dates back to 1973. But I wonder if a study
based on families and lifetime earnings, rather than snapshots of pay per
worker at any one time, would have come to such dismal findings.
Nevertheless, the slogan is that the US has been producing fewer
middle-class jobs, in the American popular sense of jobs affording a single
family house, car and associated expenditures. In Europe the reference would
be to upper-working or lower-middle class jobs - C1s or C2s in media
classification.
Toleration of 'polarisation' or other disparities depends on the prevailing
general trend. As the JEL authors point out, when polarisation of earnings
increases around a rapidly rising average, then the poor get richer and rich
get richer faster. When it grows around a stagnant mean, the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer; and an outcry is to be expected.
One explanation of polarisation is the shift away from manufacturing, where
the better-paid middle-class jobs had been found. Another factor has been
the increased premium on educational qualifications.
There has also been a growing differential in favour of middle-aged workers
against younger ones, probably reflecting the disadvantages of newcomers in
manufacturing, where there have been few new vacancies. Quite apart from
these identifiable differences, there have been growing gaps in wages paid
by different companies for workers with the same qualifications, which
researchers have been unable to explain.
The academic studies might have yielded more insights if their authors had
looked beyond the US frontier. For we are really seeing a new chapter in a
story made familiar ever since western economic growth began to slow down
after the 1973 oil price explosion. The US has taken the pressure in the
form of stagnant earnings and increased pay disparities. Europe has taken it
in the form of inadequate employment opportunities.
In 1973, the total number of jobs was very similar in the US to what it was
in a group of central and western European countries selected by the OECD.
Between then and 1989 (thus excluding the recent recession years),
employment in these European countries has risen by a bare 5m, while in the
US it has risen by 32m.
Even in the 1970s the growth of population of working age could only explain
half the difference in job growth between the two sides of the Atlantic. In
the 1980s, the demographic disparity explained almost none of the
difference, which represents American superiority in finding jobs for a
greater proportion of its labour force.
In fact, US job growth might have been much greater than the official
figures suggest because of the unrecorded influx of workers from Mexico and
elsewhere. If there is a large increase in unskilled and semi-skilled
labour, relative to capital and other resources, one would expect pay per
head to come under pressure in a flexible labour market, and average labour
productivity to stagnate as well. These phenomena are a mark not of failure,
but of successful absorption of many new workers.
Something like this would have happened in Germany if centralised agreements
had not prevented wages from coming down to market clearing levels. One hope
behind the North American Free Trade Association is that imports of goods
will replace immigrant inflows into the US. Even if, against all the odds,
this were to happen, pay among skilled workers would still suffer from the
pressures of competitive imports. Free trade normally provides an increase
in overall national income, but not necessarily for every section of the
population.
The US still produces much more per head than its main competitors,
including Japan, and even its labour market problems are a sign that the
Statue of Liberty is, however grudgingly, beckoning workers and goods from
less-favoured areas.
The orthodox diagnosis of the OECD is that the US needs to save more and
invest more, which soon comes back to the old slogan of reducing the budget
deficit. My own suspicion is that President Clinton would do more for his
country if he left the economy alone and concentrated on removing the laws
against soft drugs, and thus acted against the main force for the
criminalisation of US society.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Time for government to ensure real airline
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH P ARMITAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One of the principles on which the Conservative government initially
came to power was that creating competition, through deregulation and
privatisation, would not only lead to greater efficiency but to cheaper
services. The fundamentals of that principle have not yet happened,
particularly in the provision of utility services.
Regardless of this, one of the first companies to make the 'quantum leap'
was BA and, while it cannot be denied BA is now a flourishing business, it
would appear that success may have been achieved through stifling rather
than embracing competition.
Now BA has accepted the possibility of a 'dirty tricks' campaign against
Virgin Atlantic, and has unreservedly apologised and apparently accepted the
bill for legal costs. Is it not time for government ministers to 'put their
money where their mouths are' and allow Virgin Atlantic and other British
airline companies to compete with BA on a more 'level playing field' by
allowing them slots at Heathrow and access to more international routes?

FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Real cost to early leaver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N WOOKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Smallbone's and Mr Long's letters (December 30 and January 4) dealt
with the unfairness caused by 'early leavers' contributions to pensions
funds effectively paying for the larger pensions received by those fortunate
enough to stay with the same company until retirement. According to the
calculations quoted the government therefore allows early leavers to be
robbed of about Pounds 20bn a year, this sum then going to subsidise the
pensions of those who stay in the same company until retirement, since the
contributions of the latter group will only fund about 60 per cent of their
final pension.
I would suggest, however, that the position is not as simple as this. A
person who as an early leaver in, say, 1965 and who did not take up another
pensionable post until he retired in, say, 1990 will clearly lose out under
the present system since he will be paid at 1965 salary levels. Most early
leavers, however, whether voluntary or enforced due to redundancy, will not
take up one or more other pensionable posts until they reach retirement age.
They will then become both 'robbed early leavers' and 'subsidised final
retirees'.
Presumably the Occupational Pensions Board has done such calculations and it
would be interesting to know their conclusion as to how many suffer serious
injustice. N Wookey,

FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Auditors too often blamed instead of the directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M R HARDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing about the comments in the Lex Column on January 12,
regarding the Trafalgar House AGM.
As a shareholder and a registered auditor, I think I am well placed to view
'both sides of the coin'.
I agree with much of what is said, including that the Caparo judgment does
restrict auditors' liability too much. However, it seems to me that too
often it is the auditor who is blamed in these situations rather than the
directors who are, after all, responsible for the accounts.
Auditors' liability is unlimited at present and so it seems are our
professional indemnity insurance premiums.
I agree with your view that the auditors' duty of care to shareholders
should be widened and also that, at the same time, there should be some form
of limited liability on auditors.
However, limiting auditors' liability may have a perverse effect if an
unscrupulous auditor (there may be some) decided the continuing audit fee
was worth more than getting caught and incurring the limited penalty.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Book Review: The war before the world changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF CONFLICT 1990-91: Diplomacy and War in the New WorldOrder By
Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh Faber and Faber, Pounds 20, 504 pages
There are times, two years on, when the Iraqi invasion and allied liberation
of Kuwait can seem an age ago, resonating with such fallen and dimly
remembered names as Gorbachev, Thatcher, Baker and Shamir. This week, as the
prime mover again flaunts his defiance in Kuwait, and his prime antagonist
punishes him one more time before departing the US presidency, is not such a
time.
Yet, however events unfold in the coming days, it is clear that January 1993
will not be a rerun of January 1991. This is not just because Saddam Hussein
is a much weakened figure, his military a shadow of its former self; nor
because the allies this time have fuzzy objectives and are relying purely on
air power rather than a massive ground offensive. It is because the world
itself has changed since the last Gulf war. This timely and well-judged book
helps to remind us how.
The authors - one the professor of war studies at King's College, London;
the other a leading Israeli authority on Middle Eastern affairs  - have
produced something approaching a definitive chronicle of the 1990-91 crisis,
stretching from the prelude to Saddam's invasion to his defeat by the US-led
coalition.
Just as important, they have attempted to place the conflict in a proper
historical context. The attempt can only be provisional, but the snapshot
they provide of the world is thoughtful and thought-provoking - not least in
relation to George Bush and his much-belaboured New World Order.
Of all the cliches spawned by the Gulf war, that was perhaps the most
tedious. It was also, as Bush later realised, all too open to
misunderstanding.
As Freedman and Karsh make clear, the international effort to eject Iraq
from Kuwait was probably unrepeatable. Far from marking the dawn of a new
era when, in Bush's words, 'diverse nations are drawn together in common
cause, to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind', it was an
essentially transitional moment.
The coalition assembled against Iraq depended on a singular set of
circumstances: Gorbachev's desperate need for western support as his
domestic power base crumbled; China's desire to ingratiate itself after the
Tiananmen Square massacre; Arab awareness that there was only one
superpower. It came together because Iraq's offence was a textbook case of
aggression that simply could not pass unchallenged, and held together
because the US set itself the relatively straightforward goal of reversing
that aggression.
Between those two bald facts, Freedman and Karsh's narrative has a smooth
inexorability which perhaps does not fully reflect the widespread public
alarm and uncertainty at the time.
But the judgments underlying it are sound, and carry lessons relevant today:
that Saddam invaded Kuwait largely because of his desperate political and
economic predicament at home after the war with Iran; that economic
sanctions alone would never have dislodged him; and that, despite the
frenetic western activity in the run-up to the UN's deadline of January 16
1991, diplomacy never had a chance of yielding him concessions sufficient to
warrant withdrawal.
The authors are right, too, in squashing many of the myths that have grown
up about the war in the intervening two years: the idea, for example, that
there was some kind of eleventh-hour failure by the allies in ceasing fire
when they did. Western rhetoric about targeting Saddam or removing him from
power was all for domestic consumption; the wider coalition could never have
supported such ideas as formal war aims.
That does not mean that mistakes were not made. Indeed, in one sense the
conflict arose from one big mistake by western countries: their abject
failure to understand the nature of the Iraqi regime. They supported it
during the war with Iran, appeased it once that conflict was over, then
failed to warn Saddam clearly of the consequences of his actions during the
build-up to the invasion of Kuwait. 'Saddam Hussein,' as Freedman and Karsh
put it, 'was always an unlikely moderate.' The fact that Arab governments
also wilfully misinterpreted his motives is only a partial excuse.
But the biggest failure, and the one for which the price is still being
paid, came after the western onslaught had ceased, when Saddam's people rose
up against him and saw the outside powers who had encouraged them to do so
hurriedly retreating over the horizon.
By his own lights, it was understandable that Bush had no desire to let US
forces become embroiled in Iraq's internal affairs. Though he had difficulty
explaining as much, the war had after all been fought to preserve an
international order in which established state borders are inviolate, ethnic
or religious divisions are treated as secondary, and repressive governments
are allowed to get on with it so long as they do not bother the neighbours.
With the end of the cold war and the eruption of ancient ethnic problems,
however, it looks as if that order is crumbling. Perceptions of the world
are shifting in a way that makes the simplicity of Bush's line in the sand
seem old-fashioned. The western powers trying to police no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq are learning that Saddam's repression of the
Kurds and the Shias, like the Serbs' ethnic cleansing, is itself a potential
threat to regional peace that cannot in the long run be ignored.
If the Gulf war was a 'defining moment', that reality is what it began to
define.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: Nikolayeva plays Bach - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In four recitals in the Wigmore Hall this week Tatyana Nikolayeva is playing
Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues, The Well-Tempered Klavier. It is a leisurely
progress - each book shared between two evenings - but Nikolayeva's
burgeoning following (all seats sold well in advance) hangs on every note.
Her current popularity is difficult to explain; there is a whole cadre of
pianists from the former Soviet Union who are now making new careers in the
West, but only Nikolayeva has caught the imagination, even raising
comparisons (surely exaggerated) with her approximate contemporaries Emil
Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter.
Meanwhile Nikolayeva continues to play Bach just as doubtless she has for
the best part of 50 years. There is a take-it-or-leave-it integrity about
its plainess, with little obvious attempt at interpretation. The occasional
bout of point-making, an unexpected accent or a quickening in the middle of
a movement, seemed more the result of a change of focus than an element in a
carefully pre-planned scheme, just as phrases sometimes lost their purpose
as if Nikolayeva's concentration had wavered momentarily.
Perhaps it is the lack of adornment in her approach that seems so
attractive; maybe for the post-modern sensibility simplicity equals
spirituality, and the same record buyers who eagerly snap up Nikolayeva's
recordings are also those who consume the works of Gorecki and Tavener.
Her playing seems fresh because she offers nothing new, just old-fashioned
reassurance. There are no frills, and no thrills either - Nikolayeva offers
neither the technique fastidiousness nor the interpretative insights of,
say, Richter or Glenn Gould, the finest Bach pianists of our age; a fan
would describe her piano tone as richly mellow, an agnostic might find it
monochrome and dull. Yet she certainly projects an intellectual honesty;
whether that in itself will be enough to ensure it survives is the big
question.
Wigmore Hall; further recitals tonight and tomorrow

FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: Romances with ignition trouble - Cinema

<TEXT>
SOFT TOP, HARD SHOULDER (15) Stephan Schwartz
MAN TROUBLE (15) Bob Rafelson
SINGLES (12) Cameron Crowe
SARAFINA] (15) Darrell James Roodt
Spring is here, give or take two months, and it is time to fall in love. As
this week's movies show, anyone can do it anywhere. Dog trainers do it,
sopranos do it. Scotsmen surrounded by cattle do it; even grunge rockers in
Seattle do it. You can do it at home or at work. You can even drive deep
into the country to do it, so long as your car starts.
Or your movie, as the week's first love entry demonstrates. A special branch
of the AA should be on 24-hour duty to rescue British road movies from
breakdown or ignition failure. But where exactly should they attach the jump
leads in Soft Top, Hard Shoulder - to the first item or the second?
The soft top belongs to Peter Capaldi as the pea-brained hero, scion of an
Italian-extracted Scottish ice cream firm who is motoring from London to
Glasgow for Dad's 60th birthday and (tsk, tsk, mercenary fellow) a promised
inheritance. The hard shoulder belongs to Elaine Collins as the Scots girl
he picks up en route in his battered sky-blue Triumph. To cry on this icy
gamine's shoulder is to weep on a glacial moraine. At least until she begins
to melt a little - but there, we are giving away the story.
Shot on a wide screen without matching panache in the use of colour or
lighting (cameraman Henry Braham, director Stefan Schwartz) the film seems
at first an unwieldy gas-guzzler with seen-better-days bodywork. But do not
run away: it is also, after a short struggle, charming. As England melts
into Scotland and the film gets over its starting troubles (Frances Barber
as a caricature publisher, too much let's-set-up-the-story), the plot turns
into a modern-dress 39 Steps: two likeable oddballs handcuffed together by
fate while even odder balls come out of the scenery. I especially relished
the old widower who runs a bed and breakfast and shows the newcomers round
with a bad-news pronouncement on every stair: 'My wife choked on a Penguin .
. . My mother came here to die . . .'
Capaldi, who also screenwrote, is winning beanpole with a doleful line in
Italo-Scottish epigrams. And Collins, who would vanquish all rivals in a
Frances De La Tour lookalike contest, is tartly funny as the un-gentler sex.
Man Trouble is another odd-couple romance with ignition trouble. But this
time the engine coughs impotently for the whole 100 minutes. The premise of
Carole Eastman's screenplay - good heavens, did she once write Five Easy
Pieces? - is straight out of a game of Consequences. Guard-dog trainer Jack
Nicholson meets opera singer Ellen Barkin in sun-kissed Los Angeles. He says
to her (in essence), Do you want to rent a dog? She says to him (in
essence), Thank you, I'll take the German Shepherd and I think I'm falling
in love with you. The consequence is . . .
Well, the consequence is the movie. Bob Rafelson - good heavens, did he once
direct Five Easy Pieces? - urges his stars to make funny faces as their
vehicle stutters through farce, romance, an all-sorts supporting cast
(Beverly d'Angelo as Barkin's kidnapped sister, Harry Dean Stanton as nutty
crook) and much covert sermonising about gender politics and sexual
role-playing. In short - but if only it were - a mess.
Seattle, as you will know if you have been there, is a major centre of
Grunge Rock. So it is no wonder that grunge rocker Matt Dillon, in the film
Singles, is adored by blonde single girl Bridget Fonda, whose friend and
neighbour is handsome Campbell Scott, who has taken a shine to emotionally
bruised chance encounter Kyra Sedgwick, who has been loved and left by an
on-the-make Spaniard. And now, as the saying goes, read on.
As the music track fills with Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and Soundgarden (never
heard of any of them but grunge rock friends tell me they are big),
writer-director Cameron Crowe choreographs this fast-growing daisy chain of
amours. Crowe's first feature Say Anything was a riotously charming comedy
about love across the American caste system. Poor boy John Cusack met rich
girl Ione Sky and the twain had many a mishap trying to bridge the chasm
between Ivy League and Poverty Row.
But Singles is too many plots competing for one charm franchise. Crowe runs
from one romance to the other like a conjuror with his spinning plates, but
the only charisma on offer is of the 'Keep smiling at all costs' kind. Signs
of strain are evident in the over-mathematical matchmaking and the winsome
asides-to-camera. (Film-makers should give up the idea that the same matey
rapport can exist between a movie character and his audience as between
their live theatre equivalents.)
However I liked the safe sex party that enjoins guests to 'Come dressed as
your favourite contraceptive.' And please note director Tim 'Batman'
Burton's piquant cameo as a dating agency video-maker dubbed 'the new Martin
Scorsese.'
Sarafina] is the one film of the week in which no one 'meets cute'. But that
is no commendation. The Soweto-set South African musical has stepped off the
stage into the quicksand of location shooting. The sinking feeling is
instantly recognisable. Massed singalongs and fervent knees-ups by the black
schoolchildren who are both chorus and main characters - including pretty,
progressively politicised Sarafina (Leleti Khumalo) - erupt all over the
township and surrounding desert. Yet these big musical scenes always seem to
be falling out of frame, upscreened by the vaster sky and heat-shimmering
scrubland.
Whoopi Goldberg throws herself wholeheartedly into the mayhem, as the
schoolteacher for whom South African history began with the first black man,
not the first over-celebrated white man. (Cue appropriate classroom scene
with no yawning children.) A machine-gun behind her fridge at home signals
Whoopi's guerrilla sympathies and connections, but also telegraphs her early
demise at police hands. After that it is songs and torture scenes in roughly
equal measure.
Director Darrell James Roodt, adapting the hit show by Mbongeni Ngema (of
Woza Albert), has no idea how to unify its tone for the screen; or, if unity
is impossible, how to make the razzmatazz-versus-verismo contrast seem
pointful rather than accidental. When artifice and reality are passed
simultaneously before the camera lens, its eye will always focus sharply on
the second, turning the first into a frothy blur. So here. Sarafina] the
fledgling docudrama kicks the life out of Sarafina] the would-be musical.
The last film of the week should have been Man Bites Dog. But I never got
there. Stuck between Clapham South and Clapham North for twenty minutes - to
a Trappist silence from London Transport - I knew all hope of seeing the
week's most curious-sounding film was draining away. I shall review it, LT
willing, next Thursday.

Required watching tonight should be The Essential History of Europe; Greece
(BBC 2, 8.00). Greeks can generally be relied upon to lose all sense of
intellectual detachment whenever the subject arises of the relationship
between the modern Greek nation and the ancient Macedon of Philip and
Alexander. But as the matter of Macedon acquires ever more ominous
undertones, it is worth making the effort to disentagle the truth from
nationalistic myth-making.
The Sexual Imperative (C4, 9.00) is a highly watchable popularisation of the
neo-Darwinists' view of the mating game. Tonight's programme examines
polygamy versus monogamy in terms of the better stratagem for the survival
of genes into the next generation. When males of the species lock horns over
females there are winners and losers. Females, on the other hand, are
invariably the winners because they end up mating with the roughest,
toughest, genes on the block. Black Bag Special (C4, 8.30) follows up its
1991 story about the Cardiff Three by interviewing the men set free after
the latest revelation of a miscarriage of justice.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: A new era dawns with Barenboim - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berlin's oldest opera house, the Deutsche Staatsoper, is in festive mood.
This season marks its 250th anniversary, and is the first to bear the
imprint of Daniel Barenboim as artistic director. A new era has dawned.
After 40 years of isolation in the Communist east of the city, the
Staatsoper is re-asserting its position as Berlin's - and possibly the
world's - number one opera house.
The main anniversary celebration was Carl Heinrich Graun's Cleopatra e
Cesare, a long-forgotten opera seria which inaugurated Frederick the Great's
court opera on Berlin's Unter den Linden in 1742. There has also been a new
Harry Kupfer staging of Parsifal and a successful exhumation of Busoni's
first completed opera, Die Brautwahl.
Drawing on his extraordinary network of contacts and friendships, Barenboim
has acted as a magnet for the top talent in the business. His high-powered
cast and production team for Parsifal were all colleagues from Bayreuth, and
will form the basis of a complete Wagner cycle extending through the 1990s.
Maurice Bejart is to create a new ballet in March, Jonathan Miller will
produce Capriccio in May. Next season Patrice Chereau will re-stage his
production of Wozzeck. Pierre Boulez has agreed to give the Staatsoper his
first opera, and will conduct Boris Godunov there. What the Bastille lost
when it parted company with Barenboim in 1989, Berlin has gained.
With a salary of DM1m (Pounds 400,000) and enthusiastic support from the
German political establishment, Barenboim is doing exactly what his
paymasters wanted: transforming the Staatsoper into an upmarket operation,
with an international status to match Berlin's upgrading as the future seat
of the federal government.
The changes have come at a price. The problems and accomplishments of the
Staatsoper during the Communist era have been swept under the carpet,
leaving some long-serving employees out of a job and others bewildered by
the changes. Its orchestra, the Staatskapelle, does not yet match the
standards now being set on stage. Seat prices have rocketed to a level which
most east Berliners cannot afford.
But the biggest loser is the Deutsche Oper in the western half of the city.
Throughout the years when Berlin was divided, the Deutsche Oper alone upheld
international standards of opera. It had exclusive call on visiting opera
conductors and singers. It was a symbol of cultural freedom, benefitting
from West Berlin's special funding status as an island in the Communist
bloc. Now it finds itself competing with the Staatsoper for audiences,
artists, sponsors and subsidy. Morally, the Deutsche Oper feels it should
have emerged from unification as the outright victor. Instead, it is
battling for survival.
The Deutsche Oper's long-established intendant, Gotz Friedrich, and the new
leadership at the Staatsoper are trying to play down the rivalry. Joint
planning meetings have been held to prevent an overlap of repertoire. Each
stresses the benefits of maintaining three opera companies in the city - the
third being east Berlin's Komische Oper, which has a tradition, style and
public of its own.
But as Berlin's historic centre around the Staatsoper is redeveloped, the
Deutsche Oper faces an erosion of prestige and income. Its DM79m (Pounds
31m) subsidy for 1993 is virtually the same as last year's. In contrast, the
Staatsoper will enjoy a 30 percent increase to DM75m (Pounds 30m), and the
Komische Oper a 25 percent rise to DM51m (Pounds 20.5m) - even though they
have a smaller wage bill and the Komische Oper employs no star singers. The
Staatsoper is expected to cream off the most lucrative video and recording
work. And in Barenboim, it has a charismatic leader who is still developing
as a conductor, and carries enormous clout and goodwill.
The Staatsoper (often referred to as the Lindenoper) also has history,
architecture and atmosphere on its side. It was the first opera house to be
built in Berlin, and its fine classical exterior has survived the ravages of
fire and wartime bombing. This is where Felix Weingartner and Richard
Strauss served as Hofkapellmeister before the First World War, where Erich
Kleiber conducted the premiere of Wozzeck in 1925, where Wilhelm Furtwangler
and Leo Blech held sway in the 1930s, where 'Das Wunder Karajan' was coined
in 1938.
Faithful postwar reconstruction by the East German government preserved the
grand but intimate atmosphere of the horseshoe auditorium, with its pink and
gold decor and clear, sweet acoustic. The only disadvantage for the
Staatsoper's new clientele is that it is stranded in east Berlin, currently
resembling a building site by day and a Communist ghost town by night.
For the time being, the Deutsche Oper is still the place where singers earn
the highest fees and audiences hear the standard repertoire. Built as a
bourgeois opera house in the Charlottenburg district in 1912, the original
theatre was destroyed in the Second World War. Its postwar successor - a
concrete block with a cavernous 1900-seat auditorium - has seen a steady
stream of world premieres, has acted as the Berlin home of Domingo and
Pavarotti and staged widely-acclaimed productions of the 19th century
classics, not least Gotz Friedrich's time-tunnel version of The Ring.
Given Berlin's huge culture budget and growing importance in a united
Germany, there seems no reason why three distinctive companies should not
thrive. The choice of Graun's opera seria to open the new era at the
Staatsoper signals a welcome focus on pre-Mozartian opera, for which its
1300-seat theatre is ideal: Gluck's Alceste and Iphigenie en Tauride follow
next season, and there will be Handel after that. Harry Kupfer - spiritus
rector of the Komische Oper and a key Barenboim ally  - will help develop
the Staatsoper's large-scale German repertory, where duplication with the
Deutsche Oper is inevitable. The latter will continue with an extensive
popular repertory, interspersed with big-budget new productions.
No-one can hope to repeat Berlin's golden era before and after the First
World War. Of the city's seven major orchestras, only one today has a German
as chief conductor. For all his dedication and versatility, Barenboim is no
Furtwangler and he will be absent seven months of the year. But with Claudio
Abbado setting new artistic horizons for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra,
and Barenboim single-handedly energising the city's opera life, Berlin is
emerging as Europe's undisputed musical capital for the 1990s.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: MacMillan's 'The Judas Tree' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Ballet's new triple bill is made up of three masterworks.
Balanchine's Apollo and Symphony in C need no further laurels, but it is, I
think, important that ballet-goers should experience MacMillan's The Judas
Tree as it returns to the repertory. This was Sir Kenneth's last creation
for the Royal Ballet, and it shows him working more allusively than ever
before. It also shows him making choreographic incident and delineating
character with astonishing emotional force.
The Judas Tree is densely layered. If we 'read' its text and explore its
resonances, if we respond to MacMillan's imagery and follow him into his
world, the choreography reverberates with ideas. These have to do with
Biblical references - the ballet might then be called Judas - with a
dependant political theme about social responsibility, about assent to evil
by inanition. This MacMillan identifies in his use of a quotation from
Khalil Gibran concerning a tree's silent knowledge when a single leaf turns
yellow - whence the Tree of the title.
But the choreography is also a commentary on sexual confrontation, about
abuser and abused, about woman as sex-object and genetrix, about man as
lover and son, about how we view death (and depersonalise it in such
procedures as chalking round the outline of a corpse). Biblical references
return when the betrayed 'friend' of the Judas foreman is entombed in a
derelict car. And, examining Jock MacFadyen's set, we can see that it is
Golgotha as well as Canary Wharf.
In stressing the complex of images that lie within the dance, I risk
minimising the inventive richness of the choreography. MacMillan was here
working at the peak of his powers. Movement is breath-taking in its
perceptions, and in its sheer richness of dynamic imagination. The role of
the foreman finds Irek Mukhamedov tearing into steps, swathes of bravura
action that tell everything of the man's rage, his vulnerabilities, his
despairs. (And how vividly the image of 'fingering' someone runs through the
dance). It is a monumental performance.
Michael Nunn and Mark Silver as his friends, are no less boldly challenged,
and no less tremendous. Viviana Durante as the woman (and more exactly, as
Woman) veers between sexual provocation, grievously abused, and an
untouchable, inviolate dignity. These are interpretation of truest authority
and beauty, and they are framed by the intense and intensely danced readings
from the group of workmen. The Judas Tree demands to be seen - and seen
again.
I found the company performance on Tuesday night to be stronger than last
season. It is a tribute to the Royal Ballet that this should be so. We owe
it to posterity that this astonishing work of art be filmed with its present
and superlative cast.
The opening Apollo of the evening brought Eddie J Shellman, a guest from the
Dance Theatre of Harlem, as Apollo. It is a fine reading. Shellman
understands both the young god's simplicity ('He's a farm boy', Balanchine
once said) and the divine dignity of the role. Dance and gesture alike have
a strong, inevitable shape, and in Darcey Bussell we see a Terpsichore of
radiant grace. Together they showed us the continuing importance of this
masterpiece.
The Judas Tree can be seen at Covent Garden in this triple bill on Jan 16
eve, 21, 27, 28.

FT  14 JAN 93 / People: John Young enters SIB scrum from SFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For an organisation to pick a new chief executive in the midst of a
strategic review that could lead to its complete overhaul might seem a
strange piece of timing. Yet that is just what the Securities and
Investments Board, the UK's chief investment watchdog, has done.
The job has gone to John Young, the heavy-smoking former England rugby
international who runs the Securities and Futures Authority, one of the
self-regulatory organisations presided over by the SIB. Young has the
distinction of being the only SRO boss to have kept his organisation free of
investment scandal since the new regime created by the Financial Services
Act came into being in 1988.
What sort of an SIB will he preside over, once the full-scale review of its
activities by chairman Andrew Large is completed this spring?
Unsurprisingly, Young himself has in the past advocated a slim-line SIB,
leaving room for the SROs to spread their wings. The alternative is a
strong, centralised agency modelled more on the US Securities and Exchange
Commission.
'Somewhere in the middle of the range, rather than at either extreme,' was
Young's prediction yesterday for the outcome of the Large review - though he
claimed not to be privy to his future chairman's exact plans.
The appointment, which takes effect in April, could signal a change in style
at the SIB. A former stockbroker, Young was deputy senior partner of Simon &amp;
Coates - bought out and eventually closed down by Chase Manhattan Bank -
before moving to the Stock Exchange in 1982 as director of policy and
planning. As a former practitioner, he will preside over an SIB whose senior
staff was largely drawn from Whitehall.
Young will take over from Roy Croft, chief executive since the SIB was
created in 1985 and before that he was for long a civil servant at the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The 56-year-old Croft said yesterday that he had decided 18 months ago that
he had spent long enough at the SIB, but had agreed to stay on when it
became clear that former chairman Sir David Walker would soon be leaving.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Technology: Wooing the customers with automation -
Self-service banks are taking on more responsibilities in a bid to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under fire for their attitude towards customers and desperate to cut costs,
banks are turning increasingly to automation as a solution to their
problems.
Not only are branches expensive to run, but many customers do not like using
them. According to a study by Bo Hedberg, a professor at Stockholm
University, most customers in Sweden go to banks to get cash, pay bills or
deposit money. Only 17 per cent go to make an inquiry.
Thus he asks provocatively: 'If the bank branch did not exist in its present
form, would anyone bother to invent it?' Many UK banks are asking themselves
the same question and looking at ways of cutting branches and staff without
losing customers:
TSB Bank will shortly introduce self-service machines allowing customers to
pay bills, transfer payments between accounts or find out about loans and
mortgages.
The machines, in some Tyneside branches, will be linked to Teleservice, its
telephone-banking project. Users will be able to pick up a phone and ask for
more information. The idea is that even at fully-automated 'remote lobbies'
customers will be able to speak to someone. At a few larger branches,
customers will even be able to see a video image of the employee they are
talking to.
TSB will close a few of its 22 Tyneside branches, but increase the hours
when services are available. If the Teleservice project is successful, it
will be adopted nationally. Charles Mears, TSB's Tyneside area director,
says market research showed customers 'no longer wanted to be held captive
by branch banking hours and a trip to a branch to complete a simple
transaction'.
Barclays Bank is also cutting branches and plans to increase its use of
self-service machines. For the past year, it has assessed customers'
reaction to interactive self-service terminals installed in 12 branches.
These NCR machines, which Barclays calls Touchbank, offer instant
statements, lists of direct debits and standing orders, bill payment and
transfer of money between accounts. In addition, they can provide
calculations for loan and mortgage repayments or instant insurance
quotations.
Andrew Bailey, manager of self-service banking at Barclays, says: 'We were
surprised that customers were happy to collect so much account information
themselves.' In 1993, the bank will test a revised final prototype of the
machine for possible national use.
The National Westminster Bank is to shut 35 of its 90 branches in London's
West End and move back-office work (such as processing cheques and loans) to
two types of regional processing centre. NatWest says the money saved will
be spent on redesigning other branches to give them more space for automatic
teller machines and for interaction between staff and customers.
In addition to using ATMs from NCR, the bank is trying out self-service
machines around the country, including bank-statement printers. It also uses
some self-service machines for share dealing and mortgage information.
Gunnar Enroth, Digital Equipment's market development manager for retail
banking, expects more banks to cut branches, centralise back-office
processing and use more self-service terminals. Costs per transaction with
self-service machines are only a quarter of the cost of using staff, he
says. And machines could easily carry out the most common banking
transactions.
Customers also want better access to services, as the success of the Midland
Bank's 24-hour telephone banking service, First Direct, has shown. Paul
McDermott, systems marketing manager at NCR, says: 'Customers want service
when they want it, and they usually want it immediately.'
This helps explain why banks increasingly take their services to the
customer through ATMs in company offices, petrol stations, supermarkets,
department stores and shopping centres. Some 200 Barclays cash machines - 10
per cent of the total - are located away from banks; Lloyds has 300 non-bank
cash machines.
But machines have limitations. Cost savings vary according to how heavily
they are used. Jerry Whitmarsh, head of technology planning for NatWest's
branch network, says: 'One problem in providing a lot of services on the
same self-service machine is that it slows down the throughput of customers.
But apart from cash, it isn't usually practical to dedicate a machine to a
single product.'
However, a growing number of dedicated machines are becoming available.
Enroth says some ATMs which dispense cash in less than 15 seconds have been
installed in Russia, Germany and France.
Customers are also reluctant to use machines for some services like
depositing money. However, a new ATM from IBM being tested by some US banks
can display an image of cheques fed into it. This may help reassure
customers that the money really will end up in their accounts.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Technology: Ready for the fray - Andrew Baxter examines
Siemens Automation's ambitious targets and its strategy for achieving them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1990, the year of German reunification, Siemens Automation made its first
move into east Germany by acquiring a company in Chemnitz (formerly
Karl-Marx-Stadt) that was the eastern bloc's leading producer of numerical
controls and drives for machine tools.
It was an important, and symbolic move for a business based in Nuremberg, a
city near the edge of former West Germany but now in the centre of the
reunited country. The purchase may not have gone according to plan, due to
the collapse of the eastern European machine tool market, but Europe's
largest automation company has a broad enough back to weather a few mishaps.
With worldwide sales of DM5.8bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in 1991-92, 20,000 employees
and annual spending of DM1bn on research and development and capital
investments, Siemens Automation has plenty of technology expertise. But
Manfred von Raven, group president of Siemens Automation since October 1,
knows that the division needs to exploit its strengths to the full if it is
to achieve his ambitious targets.
The Siemens division's products have been at the centre of manufacturing
technology but still tend to be overlooked by observers of Germany's
electronics and engineering giant. It is the world leader in programmable
logic controls, the electronic boxes that get machines to do things - from
washing cars to running a computer-integrated factory. It is Europe's
biggest producer of computer numerical control units for machine tools, and
makes a whole raft of other products for use either in manufacturing
equipment or by the process industries.
After five years of double-digit growth, sales have levelled off over the
past two years because of the recession. Siemens does not disclose
divisional profits, but the CNC business is losing money - although rather
less than the heavy losses among some of its customers - and other sectors
are also feeling the pinch.
But the pivotal, if unacknowledged, role of Siemens' automation products in
giving industry increased flexibility and productivity convinces von Raven
that the pause in growth is only temporary.
'Our customers are not adding new or additional capacity,' he says, 'but I
am quite sure that 90 per cent of the investments they are making are to
increase productivity. In a recession you always talk about productivity and
cutting costs.'
Worldwide, von Raven sees the market for industrial electronics growing in
real terms by 9 per cent a year until 1997. Annual growth will reach 7 per
cent in the markets - worth DM95bn a year - where Siemens Automation
operates.
For a German company which until recently has rarely bared its soul in
public, von Raven is refreshingly honest about the division's strengths, and
where there is room for improvement if it is to exploit the market potential
against a host of very different competitors in its product sectors.
On the credit side, he sees big benefits from the company's common R&amp;D base.
'We try to do as much common spending as possible, and then build blocks on
top for individual businesses. This enables us to give smaller businesses a
chance.'
One example is the Siematic controller for plastic injection moulding
machines, only a DM50m operation and one that the division could not have
entered without its R&amp;D base.
He is also very happy with the division's ability to generate ideas. 'We
have more ideas than money,' he laughs, 'but the real measure is to look at
the number of patents we produce.' And Siemens, along with other German
companies, is good at systems integration - finding a solution that requires
more than one product.
'But we are not so good, relatively, at turning ideas into products,' he
says. 'We can and should be better and quicker at this than we are today.
Our internal discussions to build a consensus take too long. It has to do
with our culture - we are a relatively liberal company and everybody has at
least one vote or maybe even two - one in the morning and one in the
evening.'
For an automation business this is a tricky problem. Von Raven has to steer
a balance between letting his engineers 'look into their neighbour's garden'
 -an essential element of systems integration - and having them concentrate
on their own area of expertise.
Getting the balance wrong can lead to delays, and creates an
'over-engineered' product - something for which Siemens and other German
engineering companies have often been criticised.
The solution, von Raven suggests, is to cut development times dramatically
by launching the product with, perhaps, 70 per cent of its intended features
rather than waiting to achieve 100 per cent. The next model will achieve
that, and will be all the better for the dialogue with customers generated
by the original launch.
Streamlining product development times is important in all product sectors
but perhaps particularly so in CNC. The problem for Siemens here is that its
core market of European machine tool customers is highly fragmented.
Testing a new control system to ensure that so many customers like it takes
a lot longer for Siemens than for its great rival in CNC and world market
leader, Fanuc of Japan. And, says von Raven, the quantities it sells per
customer are 10 times lower than Fanuc's, on average.
Although many European machine tool makers, particularly in Germany, prefer
to use European rather than Japanese controls if they can, the perception in
the machine tool industry is that Siemens lost out to Fanuc on technology
and marketing in the mid-1980s and has only recently bounced back. Even now,
von Raven admits: 'Our image is lower than our performance.'
A second important element in meeting the future growth targets is
geographical expansion. In the current environment von Raven is keeping a
careful eye on capital spending but, Chemnitz apart, he has no doubt where
the division should go.
'A stool has to have three legs,' he says. 'Europe is the main one, North
America is second (the division recently strengthened its position in the US
by buying Texas Instruments' PLCs business) and I'm looking for Asia to
provide the third.'
This brings Siemens Automation up against the Japanese again - in their home
market. But, as with all the new challenges for the division, von Raven is
ready for the fray, and confident about the outcome.

Williamson, BAT Industries' large US tobacco business. Tommy Sandefur, 53,
will take over as chairman and chief executive of Brown and Williamson when
the current British incumbent, Ray Pritchard, retires at the end of March.
Pritchard is the latest in a series of top BAT executives nearing retirement
age. Brian Garraway, the deputy chairman, retired last October and Sir
Patrick Sheehy, the chairman since 1982, is expected to retire in September
when he will be 63.
However, the latest reshuffle gives no clues as to who will take over from
Sheehy. Sandefur, unlike Pritchard, will not have a seat on the BAT
Industries board and most observers still think that Sheehy's successor will
be drawn from a short list which includes Martin Broughton and Ulrich
Herter, who head the two biggest parts of BAT's business - financial
services and tobacco - and David Allvey, the finance director.
Even so Sandefur will be one of BAT's two top executives in North America -
an area which contributes two thirds of the group's profits. Brown and
Williamson, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is the third biggest US cigarette
company with sales of nearly Dollars 3.5bn.
Its share of the US market, currently 11.1 per cent, has been rising and it
has a growing export business, particularly in the Far East. Brands include
Kool, Capri, Belai and Barclay.
Sandefur is a tobacco man through and through. Born in Perry, Georgia, he
worked for RJ Reynolds for 18 years and was executive vice president  -
Europe, before joining Brown and Williamson as senior vice president of
international marketing ten years ago. In January 1985, he was made
president and chief operating officer.

Gateway, the troubled food retail group, has appointed Stan Frith as
personnel director to replace Bryan Taker who left yesterday. It is the
first appointment made by David Simons, who became chief executive of
Isosceles, Gateway's parent, on January 4.
Frith's career has spanned Texas Instruments and lately Bunzl. But it was
his stint at House of Fraser, the department store group, which must have
prompted this career move. Simons was finance director there.
*****
Robert Watkins, Amstrad's technical director and one of seven main board
members, has resigned.
Amstrad made the announcement after the Stock Market closed yesterday and
gave no explanation for the unexpected resignation. Watkins was unavailable
for comment and Alan Sugar, the founder and chairman, was out of the office
yesterday.
Watkins was re-elected to the Amstrad board at the company's annual meeting
in November - in the midst of Sugar's controversial 30p-a-share bid to take
the group private again.
Last month, in the wake of the shareholder rejection of Sugar's proposals,
Watkins was one of two Amstrad directors to sell their stakes in the
company; he sold his total holding of 563,500 shares at 23 1/8 p, raising
Pounds 130,309 before costs.
Meanwhile, Pro-Ned is due this week to provide Amstrad with a shortlist of
candidates for two non-executive directorships.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why the Friesian
Lady is feeling full of beans - Nikki Tait explains how standardised
packaging has helped Sara Lee to sell its coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King Edward VII of England once declared that the boundaries of Germany were
defined by the badness of the coffee. In the Ardennes, tradition prescribes
10 cups after dinner while in Turkey, the drink is meant to be 'black as
hell, strong as death and sweet as love'.
So how, in the age of harmonised markets, satellite TV and 'Euro-branding',
does a pan-European supplier market such an inherently nationalistic
product?
Sara Lee, the US consumer products company, thinks it has an answer. The
Chicago-based group, best-known for its cheesecake and bagels, is also one
of the biggest companies in the European roasted coffee market. Its main
rival, Philip Morris, acquired its market position through the single
acquisition of Switzerland's Jacobs Suchard in 1990. But Sara Lee has built
up a European portfolio piecemeal, purchasing almost a dozen coffee
companies over a decade and a half.
This gave the US multinational market shares ranging from 74 per cent in the
Netherlands, where Sara Lee sells the Douwe Egberts brand, to 27 per cent in
Denmark (Merrild Kaffe), 21 per cent in Spain (Marcilla) and 15 per cent in
France (Maison du Cafe). But it also led to a plethora of marketing
arrangements, packaging designs and brand promotion methods.
Sara Lee is the first to admit that coffee is still a 'very locally
determined product', right down to the way consumers prepare it. But in the
late 1980s as the US company weighed up the implications of European
'harmonisation', it was equally clear that there were savings to be garnered
from co-ordinating marketing efforts.
Cor Boonstra, a Sara Lee director and head of the international operations
in Utrecht, makes no secret of the basic problem confronting the company's
roasted coffee business. 'We simply couldn't support the brands properly in
every country,' he says.
It was with these cost considerations in mind that Boonstra first floated
the notion of 'internationalising' the various coffee brands four years ago.
As a result, Sara Lee has come up with the quintessential 'Euro-marketing'
compromise. Its coffee still sells under country-specific brand names but
standardised packaging and a common corporate symbol provide a strong visual
similarity and allow for streamlined promotion.
At the outset, Boonstra realised the danger of putting individual managers'
noses out of joint: 'The problem was that management didn't want to give up
its position (on marketing) in some countries.'
So Sara Lee tackled the management changes fairly gently - leaving the
national marketing teams in place and, for the first 18 months,
concentrating on developing the contacts between them. Only then was an
international development manager brought in.
The more fundamental problem, however, was how to unify the country brands
without making customers feel that they were buying a bland 'Euro-coffee'.
It was at this point that an internal Sara Lee development team alighted on
an old 'Friesian Lady' packaging design, which had been used in the
Netherlands and showed a woman in simple 18th century dress pouring coffee.
Sara Lee felt the symbol conveyed a soothing message, full of 'authenticity'
and 'quality'. So it called in Landor Associates, the international
corporate identity consultants owned by Young &amp; Rubicam, to brush up the
motif prior to introducing the Friesian Lady prominently on all its European
coffee products. This was accompanied by the redesign of the packaging so
that boxes containing the coffee came in standardised sizes with consistent
colours.
Advertising strategy was also brought under one roof, with Sara Lee
switching the coffee account to BBDO - part on the US-based Omnicon group -
on a pan-European basis.
Today, the final elements of this strategy have yet to be put in place.
There are still design changes to be implemented in Spain, Hungary and
Denmark although products in the UK and the Netherlands are largely
completed.
But the cost savings, says the company, have already started to flow. It
cites a TV commercial to promote the 'Manilla' brand in Spain. Much of the
visual imagery and the sound-track backing were re-used in an advertisement
for the Hungarian brands. The net result proved significantly cheaper than
the production of two separate ads.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The shape of things
to come / A look at the problems of designing packaging that appeals to
consumers across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICOLE DICKENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If sales rise after a new packaging design is introduced, everyone gets the
credit except the designer.
If sales decline, the design is at fault. That highlights a problem that has
dogged packaging designers: their inability to quantify the value of their
work.
But in the last few years companies have cast aside such doubts and
increasingly turned towards design services as they standardise their
products across Europe.
But how valid is the belief that one packaging design can appeal to
consumers?
In 1991 Galbani, the Italian cheese producer, set out to double turnover in
Europe and hired the London design company Minale Tattersfield to harmonise
10 different packaging designs.
A design was created which depicted the Tuscan landscape, Gingham table
cloth and appetising dishes for each particular cheese. The project,
including research, cost Pounds 100,000.
Sales increased by 22 per cent in the UK, by 33 per cent in Germany and 50
per cent in France in six months without any advertising. 'At least 65-70
per cent of the sales increase can be linked to design,' claims MarcelIa
Minale, chairman of Minale Tattersfield.
Campbell Biscuits Europe, a division of the Campbell Soup Company, faced a
more ambitious task. It decided to standardise the packaging design of five
brands, three logos and 100 products under the well-established Belgian
Delacre brand, which it wanted to position as Europe's premium biscuit
brand.
It hired Milan design company Break to modernise the logo and create a
single packaging design, intended to emphasise the skill and tradition of
the French pastry chef.
According to Joel Oberman, vice-president of marketing at Campbell Biscuits
Europe: 'Of all the ways to market, design is one of the most important'.
Campbell Biscuit's redesign was completed in three months, but it took nine
months to implement the rationalised product line across Europe.
With any redesign there is a risk of confusing consumers. The dangers are
multiplied if it involves relaunching a product under a different brand
name.
Oberman expected a '30 per cent annual decline in those products we modified
 -that's normal. We would have had to do a lot of spade work to build the
brands back up. But there was no sales decline in any of the products we
changed'.
To minimise the risks, Campbell Biscuits retained the Dutch brand Nobo in
the Netherlands, where consumer awareness of Delacre was just 0.8 per cent.
Similarly the Belgian biscuit Bichoc was renamed Deli-choc for the European
market. For other product lines the modernised Delacre logo and revamped
packaging was introduced.
Sales increased by more than 20 per cent in Germany and by 10 per cent in
France in the year to July 1992. It was impossible to isolate the impact on
sales of the new design from the advertising and public relations effort,
but Oberman says: 'Packaging will have as great an impact on overall image
as advertising. For new products and new design approaches, it has a much
greater impact.'
Common designs can also be particularly cost-effective for new product
launches, as packaging accounts for a significant share of the company's
cost structure, 'Management decision-making in terms of design is
streamlined and overall development costs are diminished,' says Oberman.
Household detergents are a product which is, in theory, easier to harmonise
across Europe, as consumer needs are similar.
In 1991, when Unilever decided to launch a new dishwasher powder across
Europe it hired London design consultancy Design Bridge. The brief was to
design packaging which would capture qualities such as efficacy, modernity
and authority and stress the environmental friendliness of the product.
Within six months Sun Progress achieved a 22 per cent share of the German
market where the Tengelmann supermarket chain dropped all other dishwasher
powders.
Although the product was developed for the European market and the
lettering, lay-out and basic design is the same throughout Europe, research
in France, Germany, Italy and the UK revealed different consumer priorities.
This resulted in Unilever promoting different product claims on the package,
such as environmental qualities in Germany and its compatibility with fine
porcelain in the UK.
'One pack design for Europe is unrealistic because of different language
requirements,' says Philip Lawder, marketing director of Design Bridge. 'The
local language must come first in France and in the UK.'
But the benefits for Unilever of standardising European packaging are not
restricted to economies of scale. Intense competition in the industry means
that speed is of the essence in new product development.
Design Bridge advises clients to carry out consumer research to evaluate
packaging design. Questionnaires can be devised to assess how well a new
design is communicating a brand's values compared with the old one. With new
launches similar studies contrast the brand design with that of rival
products.
Like the vital initial consumer research, studies into effectiveness need to
be carefully devised and monitored. 'There isn't a consumer vocabulary for
design and consumers don't rationalise design. But by asking the right
questions you can gauge the effect of design,' says Lawder.
Given the high level of interest in pan-European brands, it is not
surprising that design industry executives are reluctant to disclose details
of cases in which a common European design is found to be inappropriate.
But Jan Hall, chairman of London design consultancy Coley Porter Bell,
believes that a high degree of commonality can be achieved in only about 20
per cent of cases. She estimates that in 5 per cent of cases national
consumer differences or problems associated with national brand positioning
prevents harmonisation.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Heady experience on the bottom rung of
audit ladder / A look at a training course that mixes hard work and play -
and instils 'firm values'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY came from all over Europe, the Middle East and Africa. They flocked to
an obscure Dutch village in their hundreds, fresh-faced graduates with
little experience of the world of business. By next Monday, most will be out
on their first audit assignment.
Over two weeks, they have endured more than 12 hours a day of training, each
one accompanied by less sleep and more powerful hangovers. They have been
mixed by gender, colour and nationality. They have been hard at work and at
play in the classrooms, the bars and the sports facilities. This is basic
training for auditors; boot camp for the recruits of Arthur Andersen.
Mention Fast - short for firm-wide audit staff training - to a current or
former Andersen professional and eyes will mist over with nostalgia. About
4,000 of this year's intake of 5,000 recruits worldwide will attend.
That explains the long list of accountants with the firm who are eager to go
back and teach their more junior colleagues, while re-living their past. The
considerable delegation within the firm to those in junior positions means
that many have the chance before memories of the original fade too far.
This year, things are slightly different. The 250 students and 30 tutors now
coming to the end of a residential conference centre near Eindhoven in the
Netherlands have become guinea pigs for a new, improved course. Their
sessions are being observed, questionnaires are being circulated, focus
groups held every day. Simultaneously, a session is just finishing in
Andersen's other principal training centre, St Charles outside Chicago.
It is the course with no name, or at least no digestible abbreviation. It is
called ABA WST - audit and business advisory worldwide staff training - or
Aberystwyth, as some of its instructors have started to dub it.
It represents 18 months of development, tens of thousands of hours of
professionals' time in planning and some Dollars 1.7m in preparation costs
to date. The offices sending participants are spending more than Dollars
3,000 a head for the privilege.
ABA WST is arguably the single most important element of the Dollars 350m
which Andersen says it spent on training last year, out of fee income
totalling Dollars 5.6bn.
The content of the syllabus has changed substantially from Fast. The
gruelling regime - just as important as the learning in the classroom -
remains virtually unchanged, although each class of former trainees claims
its own was the toughest.
By the end of the second week, most of participants' energy has been long
drained, and only momentum drives them on - giving them a taste of the
stamina they may well need for the rest of their career with the firm.
How much knowledge they retain is debatable. One of the most common concerns
among the trainees is whether they have sufficient skills to go out on their
first audit. Their instructors constantly allay these fears. They argue that
a tight supervision structure, well-established firm procedures and the
impressive ability of the recruits will get them through.
What is certain is that those taking part make friends for life, forming a
common bond against the pressures of the course. Critics say the course
moulds them into the raw material for a career at 'Arthur Android'. The more
diplomatic call the experience a culture bath.
Everything is geared around getting the participants to mix continually. The
Koningshof conference centre is nearly two hours' journey from Amsterdam,
and 20 minutes walk from the nearest off-site bar. It was purposely chosen
to be distant from distractions which might lure students off the campus.
That does not deter the hardy. Each evening, large groups - led by the South
Africans, the British and the Irish - seek out the nearest bar once the
hotel's own facilities shut down at 1am. Others collapse into bed ready for
the early start.
Koningshof is designed around groups. The bedrooms are clean and functional.
They are very small and have no distractions such as television. The one
item of equipment is an alarm clock for early wake-ups.
The centre is self-contained, and focused around communal areas, with
several restaurants and bars as well as many classrooms. There are elaborate
sports facilities, and the ABA WST timetable schedules an hour before dinner
each day specifically for sports. It also slots in an athletics competition
on the first Wednesday. Most people take part.
In a typically canny accountant's move, Andersen drew up a complex contract
with the centre's management four years ago. It uses the facilities at a
substantial discount and has its own wing which is now being expanded. But
it does not assume the risks of the entire hotel, which takes clients from
other corporate customers. It expects to break even each year, charging all
costs to the national Andersen firms.
Most hours each day are spent in classes. They start promptly at 8am, and
rarely finish before 10pm, with short breaks for coffee, lunch and dinner.
Anyone who is late faces a forfeit. Tardy trainees had to stand on a chair
and sing their national anthem, stand on one leg and recite a nursery rhyme,
or crawl around the floor impersonating an elephant.
Classes are also smartly turned out. Andersen people dress down for dinner,
quickly changing into jeans during the evening break. That is a habit which
tends to persist during their careers. But during the day, they are in smart
outfits. Many of the men are already adorned in the dark grey suits that are
almost ubiquitous among partners.
Aspects of the Andersen culture occupy the first three days - the 'core
course'. Trainees learn communication, teamwork, time management and
research skills. They are told about business protocol and building internal
relationships in the firm. Resumes listing each others' backgrounds and
interests are circulated to everyone. Years later, accountants in the firm
use these connections to help ease international assignments.
But the emphasis on firm values continues for the rest of the fortnight.
Everyone is allocated to new classes after the first three days, with the
exception of the French who have instruction in their own language. Trainees
within each class are regularly rotated, ensuring that the genders and
nationalities mix. Much of the training is in groups and teams, and requires
presentations.
Learning is based around a simulated audit of a fictitious US hair products
company called 'Style by Castan'. Trainees watch videos, read press
clippings and gain an understanding of the business and its accounting
systems. They learn about risk assessment and planning the audit.
Then they prepare work papers, and get going on topics such as the
expenditure cycle, inventory observation, the revenue cycle, receivables,
property, plant and equipment, profit and loss, contingencies and the
financial reporting cycle.
In between, they are periodically referred back to the firm's audit manuals,
and instructors throw in examples from their own experiences. Audit
standards are emphasised alongside client value. The importance of fees -
including identifying additional functions which the firm can sell - are not
neglected.
Mr Marco Castino, a partner from Andersen's Italian practice, says there
have been substantial changes to the syllabus since Fast. The course
provides less detail but more overview, emphasising the business reasons
rather than simply the procedures. It has also been made less US-based to
reflect the firm's worldwide nature.
By the start of next week, those who took part may not have grasped every
fine point of auditing, but they have laid the foundations for a
long-standing career in the world's most unified accountancy firm.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Court told of Ward's role in takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer, was more responsible for the success of
Guinness's 1986 takeover bid for Distillers than anyone else involved, an
Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director, said he had the
greatest admiration for Mr Ward's work during the takeover battle with
Argyll. He was the most important person in achieving the successful
takeover, Mr Roux said.
Mr Ward's payment for his role, however, was a matter for Mr Ernest
Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, Mr Roux told the court.
Mr Ward is accused of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, one charge of
false accounting and another count of executing a valuable security in
connection with the alleged theft. He denies all the charges.
Mr Roux said that when, after the bid had succeeded, he authorised the
invoice for paying Pounds 5.2m from Guinness to Marketing and Acquisitions
Ltd he had no knowledge Mr Ward would be the beneficiary.
He said Mr Ward had told him the payment would go to third parties in the US
whose services had been used during the bid.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Aid group to pinpoint effects of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT to which the recession is handicapping the work of Britain's
voluntary sector is to be examined by the Charities Aid Foundation.
The CAF - which advises charities on investments and is a leading source of
research on the sector - has commissioned a survey of 400 charities, from
the largest to local voluntary organisations, in 20 places around the
country.
Charities will be asked how their income compares with two years ago from:
individual donations; legacies; corporate support; income from the sale of
goods and services; and local and central government grants and fees.
The survey comes when charities are finding demand for their services
outstripping income growth. Previous research has shown little real increase
in charitable giving in recent years, although many of the biggest charities
have managed to expand their income against the general trend.
Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the CAF, said: 'There are
indications that the overall decline in income growth is now beginning to
affect some of the biggest charities as much as the others. The survey will
provide information on the extent of this trend.'
As a number of charities prepare to take on additional responsibilities with
April's community care reforms, there is growing concern that attempts in
the 1980s to encourage substantially greater support for charity appear to
have failed.
Voluntary-sector leaders have developed plans for a national marketing
campaign - modelled on successful precedents in the US and Canada - to
promote the general concept of charitable giving. Ministers have, however,
decided against helping to finance it and it is unlikely to get off the
ground.
Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, has assured voluntary organisations in
Northern Ireland that they will be consulted on the reform of EC structural
funds and other social policy developments. That follows a visit by the EC
president to the province late last year.
Mr Quintin Oliver, director of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary
Service, said that by agreeing to formal consultation with voluntary
organisations Mr Delors had acknowledged 'that the voluntary sector in
disadvantaged areas has a key role to play, especially in Northern Ireland'.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Resurgence of quangos defies Thatcher's new broom: Lack of
accountability identified - Bodies control more than a fifth of public
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUANGOS are on the march again. Fourteen years ago Lady Thatcher, then prime
minister, launched a cull of the quasi-autonomous non-governmental
organisations that carry out a wide range of administrative and regulatory
functions on behalf of the government.
Yet while the number of such unelected bodies has been reduced, their
spending has not. Research by the Financial Times shows that the amount of
taxpayers' money spent by quangos has risen in real terms since the
Conservatives came to power in 1979.
Quangos now account for more than a fifth of public spending, running the
health service, distributing funds to higher and further education and
dispensing legal aid.
They reach deep into the business world through organisations such as the
Health and Safety Executive, the inner-city development corporations and the
Training and Enterprise Councils which deliver government-funded training in
England and Wales.
They are also extending their activities - taking over many schools,
colleges, public-housing projects, hospitals and local health services.
A report published at the end of last year by the European Policy Forum, the
market-oriented think tank, showed that the UK's public services are
increasingly run by a new elite that cannot be held to account.
The growth has occurred in spite of Lady Thatcher's determination to attack
the power and influence of quangos.
In 1978-79, the last year of the Labour government, their number had risen
to about 2,410. They employed almost 1.2m people and spent Pounds 14bn of
public money. The newly elected Conservative government saw their growth as
a symbol of how Whitehall had grown too big. Quangos were a way for the
public sector to spread its tentacles throughout national life, spending
money on functions that were often unnecessary or even damaging to a
free-market economy.
A study in 1979 by Sir Leo Pliatzky, a top mandarin, confirmed that view. He
identified more than 240 executive and advisory bodies to be wound up, and
by the end of the first Thatcher term, the number of quangos had been cut by
almost 500.
Early casualties included the Committee on the Artificial Insemination of
Cattle and the Hadrian's Wall Advisory Committee. After the first Thatcher
term, the pressure eased.
In some years new quangos were added to the list as fast as old ones were
scrapped. The Apple and Pear Development Council disappeared, for example,
but the Apple and Pear Research Council made its debut.
All 17 English new town development corporations in 1979 were wound up as
their projects reached completion. But 10 urban development corporations
were set up to manage inner-city regeneration.
The Manpower Services Commission - the quango with second-largest budget in
1978-79 - was abolished. But its training functions have since been passed
on to more than 80 new Tecs and to local enterprise companies in Scotland.
Guidelines issued by the Cabinet Office in 1985 formalised the change of
heart: new quangos were acceptable when they were 'the most appropriate and
cost-effective solution'. Like previous governments, the Tories began to
find the quango an appropriate and cost-effective solution to a growing
range of issues.
Quangos such as Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, and the National
Rivers Authority were set up to regulate the privatised utilities. They
provide a mechanism for intervening in private-sector companies in the
public interest without re-imposing the ministerial interference that dogged
the nationalised industries.
When large metropolitan counties such as the Greater London Council were
abolished in 1986, residuary bodies were appointed to run down their assets
 -the only remaining one, for London, spent more than Pounds 360m in
1990-91, making it the 26th-largest quango.
Housing Action Trusts have been set up to renovate large, run-down public
housing estates in places such as Liverpool and Waltham Forest in London.
They, too, are managed by boards appointed by the environment secretary,
rather than by local authorities - which the government blames for the
condition of the housing estates concerned.
By 1990-91, the most recent year for which statistics have been published,
the number of quangos had fallen to 1,846 - down 564 from 1978-79. But that
smaller number was spending more in real terms than before Lady Thatcher
started her cull.
In 1990-91, quangos spent Pounds 41.7bn, three times that in 1978-79 and 20
per cent above the rate of inflation. Far from curbing the quangos, the Tory
government had increased their spending power.
Other reforms in the public services can be expected to increase the number
and spending of quangos still further. New bodies are being created to
manage public services as independent, competing organisations, with no
direct accountability.
Reforms to the National Health Service, for example, have created
independent NHS trusts since April 1991 to provide health services. Almost
all NHS hospitals and community health services will soon be controlled by
450 of these new quangos.
The government expects more than 1,000 schools in England and Wales to have
become grant-maintained by the end of this year, quangos run by their
governing bodies outside local authority control. While a minority of
governors will be elected by parents, most will be a self-perpetuating group
who co-opt their successors, subject only to the right of the education
secretary to appoint his own nominees.
A new quango, the Funding Agency, will allocate resources to the
grant-maintained schools and supervise their operations.
Further-education colleges have also been taken out of local-authority
control and are run by similarly self-perpetuating boards. Yet another
quango has been established to fund them.
As the European Policy Forum report says, that leaves public services
increasingly under the control of unelected boards whose members are
answerable only to the minister who appoints them and provides their funds.
There is certainly no formal accountability to those who use the services
and pay for them through their taxes. The members of the boards that run
quangos are often little known, meeting in secret and not subject to
external public scrutiny.
According to the European Policy Forum there is also no body of
administrative law to regulate their activities. Similar bodies in the US
are required to publicise proposed policy changes and give opportunities for
informed comment.
Professor John Stewart of Birmingham University, one of the authors of the
policy forum report, sees the spread of quangos taking Britain back to the
1880s, when local services were controlled by appointed lay magistrates
rather than by elected councils. He says the move away from elected local
government of public services is creating a 'new magistracy'.
It is certainly not the outcome expected from a government that came to
power pledged to sweep away these unelected and secretive bodies.
There may be a valuable role for autonomous boards to play in public
administration. But the growing power of quangos in the provision of public
services means that there is no significant way in which they are directly
accountable to those who use them and pay for them through their taxes.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Shake-up faces charity accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH charities are likely to face a radical restructuring of the way they
present their accounts, under a statement of practice to be issued by the
Charity Commission next month.
It will move away from the conventional profit-and-loss account, which
focuses on profits, towards a statement showing charities' activities more
clearly.
The accounts of many more branches of charities - such as local shops or
fund-raising groups - will be consolidated in the figures published by the
national organisation.
The new statement of recommended practice for charities, Sorp 2, is expected
to form the basis of mandatory regulations to accompany the 1992 Charities
Act, to be published by the Home Office this year.
The Charity Commission is deciding on the final format of a 'statement of
activities' to replace the profit-and-loss account and to be published in
Sorp 2, said Mr Pesh Framjee, head of the charities unit at accountants BDO
Binder Hamlyn and a member of the working party created by the commission.
The statement will be consistent with a similar format for non-profit
organisations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the USA,
reflecting the fact that charities have no single indicator of performance
comparable to profit for companies.
It will distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure, and provide
more details of the way money is spent. It will show any changes in net
assets, and distinguish between unrestricted and restricted funds - those
used only for specific purposes.
It will separately list resources received by the charity, and split items
such as legacies, endowments, grants, trading results and income from local
branches.
Mr Framjee said Sorp 2 would also reduce the number of charity branches not
consolidated in a charity's main accounts. Branches will be required to
consolidate even if they are autonomous and carry out business in the name
of a charity.
That means showing their assets and liabilities on the parent charity's
balance sheet, clearly showing all income and expenditure, rather than
showing only a contribution net of expenses in the main accounts.
The Charity Commission plans to circulate the Sorp 2 discussion document
during February for public consultation. It will update the original version
produced by the Accounting Standards Committee in 1988.
In the past five years the commission has taken a far more active role in
improving financial reporting among charities.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Privacy may be protected by new law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is examining civil law measures to defend privacy rights, to
add to the drafting of new criminal offences against the intrusive use of
electronic surveillance and telephoto lenses, it emerged yesterday.
A possible extension of the law of tort to cover privacy was raised by
senior ministers at a cabinet sub-committee after it was agreed to rush
forward publication of Sir David Calcutt QC's report on media behaviour to
today.
Alongside his central recommendation of a statutory press tribunal, Sir
David calls also for a new criminal offence of 'physical intrusion' to
prevent the use of bugging devices, long-range camera lenses and other
electronic equipment to illicitly gather information.
The new law would give the High Court the authority to issue injunctions
against the the publication of information gathered by such means. It would
also would provide for large damages to be awarded to the victims of such
intrusion.
Creating the separate breach-of-privacy tort, or civil wrong, would allow
individuals to sue for compensation in the courts when they believed they
could prove their private lives had been unreasonably invaded by intrusive
behaviour or reporting. It is recommended by Sir David.
There would be considerable legal complexities, however, over where the
mitigating defence of public interest applied and over how to cover legal
costs.
Downing Street said early publication of the controversial Calcutt report,
originally scheduled at the end of the month, was necessary to counter a
distorted debate of the subject misinformed by 'partial leakages' of its
findings.
The decision came as a new storm was mounting over claims that the security
services might be behind the leaking of tape-recordings of phone calls,
allegedly made by members of the royal family.
Lord Rees-Mogg, a former editor of The Times and now chairman of the
Broadcasting Standards Authority, made the charge yesterday after the
publication in Australia of an alleged conversation between the Prince of
Wales and his longtime friend, Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles.
A senior official rejected the claim as 'nonsensical' and dismissed any
possibility of an inquiry.
A formal response to the Calcutt report will be discussed at a full meeting
of the cabinet today. Ministers will also decide whether a statement should
be made to the Commons outlining the government's immediate reaction to its
findings.
Officials said it was quite possible that a statement would be made by Mr
Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, but that a detailed government
response, including proposals on legislation, could be held back until
later.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tighter rules urged for disclosure
of payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government spending watchdog called yesterday for much clearer public
disclosure of payments such as the Pounds 4,700 made by the Treasury towards
Mr Norman Lamont's legal costs in evicting a tenant from his London home.
The report from the National Accounts Committee to the cross-party public
accounts committee also showed that Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent
secretary, suggested that the Treasury should meet more of Mr Lamont's total
bill. The view of other senior officials, in favour of more limited
assistance, prevailed.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the chairman of the PAC, said that the committee would
decide on Monday the witnesses it would now call as part of its
investigation into the affair. They are set to include Sir Peter and two
other senior officials involved in discussing the legal expenses; Sir Terry
Burns, his successor, and Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil Service.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, called for Mr Lamont to repay
the money into public funds.
The case arose in spring 1991 but came to light only late last year after
press reports.
The memorandum from Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, called for tighter
rules on departmental help to ministers in matters beyond their official
duties. There were, he said, 'dangers' both to ministers and civil servants
in leaving so much to the discretion of officials: it was 'unsatisfactory'
that much of the existing guidance was not relevant to the case.
He clearly favours involving parliament in the review of the rules, which he
recommends should be carried out by the cabinet office and the Treasury, in
order to recognise the public-interest considerations.
While the Treasury rejected suggestions of implied criticism of how it had
handled the matter, MPs on the committee were clearly not satisfied by what
Sir John found.
His report commented that while special payments had to be highlighted only
if they exceeded Pounds 100,000, there was provision for noting smaller
amounts where there were doubts about the 'propriety' of the payment.
On Monday, the cross-party committee on members' interests will publish its
report on Mr Lamont's omission to declare that an anonymous Tory donor had
settled the rest of his bill.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories reduce Labour poll lead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S opinion-poll lead has been cut to 4 per cent in a survey for
today's Guardian.
The ICM survey shows the Conservatives as being considered to have the best
economic policies - recapturing the advantage they lost as a result of Black
Wednesday.
Voting intention figures put the Tories at 38 per cent, up 5 per cent since
December; Labour 42 per cent, down 3 per cent; Liberal Democrats 15 per
cent, down 1 per cent and others 5 per cent, down 1 per cent.
Just 24 per cent of interviewees said the Conservatives had the best
policies for the economy, but this was up 5 per cent from December and
enough to put them 1 per cent in front of Labour on the issue.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Short accuses 'modernisers'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S so-called modernisers are accused today of being ashamed of the
party's past, devising policy in response to opinion polls and ditching the
poor and the trade unions.
In an outspoken article in the leftwing Tribune newspaper, Ms Clare Short,
MP for Birmingham Ladywood, attacks the policy reformers and image-creators
by claiming that people no longer know what Labour stands for.
'Many feel that they cannot trust a party that appears to have dumped
everything it used to believe in and seems not to have a way forward that is
different from the mess the Tories have created,' she says.
The soft-left MP says the modernisers have stifled internal debate and
claims that a strong policy platform devised after the 1987 election was
'watered down' by pollsters and 'sound-bite merchants'.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister hints at access to
documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENSITIVE government documents kept secret for more than 30 years under the
present rules on disclosure could be published under an initiative from Mr
William Waldegrave, the public-service minister, Alison Smith writes.
Mr Waldegrave has asked departments to consider releasing papers identified
by historians as being of particular value.
Answering questions from the cross-party Treasury and Civil Service
committee he said that there were 'too many' documents still held beyond 30
years, but insisted that bringing forward the date at which papers could
generally be published would diminish the 'necessary frankness' in
government documents.
He also expressed regret that, in writing their memoirs, former cabinet
ministers had disregarded conventions about revealing cabinet and
departmental discussions, saying that the practice was extremely unfair to
officials.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pessimism over recovery outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery in Britain will be constrained by rising current-account
and fiscal deficits and by fragile consumer confidence, according to a
report by the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, published
yesterday.
The report calls on the Bank of England to publish its advice to the
Treasury on monetary policy to reduce confusion in financial markets about
how policy is determined.
Giving a bleak view of the UK's medium-term prospects, the Tory-dominated
committee of backbench MPs says the scope for cuts in interest rates may be
limited by the need to 'avoid any further substantial depreciation of
sterling' to add to that which has already happened since Britain left the
European exchange rate mechanism last September.
The committee hints that substantial measures for growth may be needed in
the March Budget to produce a substantial upturn, but does not rule out the
need for tax rises to hold back the increase in the public-sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR).
According to the MPs, Britain faces 'an abyss of ever-increasing fiscal
deficits' over the next few years, assuming that growth remains fairly weak.
The latest City estimates put the likely PSBR in 1993-94 at about Pounds
50bn, after about Pounds 40bn this financial year.
The committee wants Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to announce in the
Budget a strategy to bring down the deficit over the next few years,
possibly with a programme of gradually increased taxes and cuts in public
spending.
On the outlook for growth, the committee says: 'It is not clear whether the
limited policy measures announced during the Autumn Statement (published by
the Treasury in November) and reductions in interest rates will be
sufficient to counter the effects of rising unemployment and falling asset
prices on confidence.'
The MPs say a current-account deficit amounting to about 2 per cent of gross
domestic product in a recession suggests a 'structural' trouble arising out
of undue reliance on imports.
They warn: 'The UK may find itself suffering from an old-fashioned
balance-of-payments constraint with further downward pressure on sterling
requiring tighter policies which will in turn squeeze the personal sector's
disposable income.'
The MPs suggest the policy vacuum since Britain left the ERM - since when
the government has cut base rates by 3 percentage points to 7 per cent - has
left Mr Lamont with a 'pick and mix' approach to economic policy.
According to the committee, government statements since September on growth
strategies have 'led to some confusion as to what is now the main objective
of macroeconomic policy'.
It calls on Mr Lamont to reduce the confusion in the Budget by saying
exactly what economic indicators he is using to steer policy.
The report says a repeat of the fiasco surrounding the ERM last summer, when
Germany's desire to seek a general realignment of the system was not passed
on to Britain, might be avoided by better communications between member
states over realignment requests.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht coup advances referendum
cause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROCEDURAL coup by Tory Euro-sceptics and Labour MPs opposed to any
further extension of the powers of the European Community yesterday opened
up the possibility of British voters having the opportunity to decide the
fate of the Maastricht treaty through a referendum.
They have succeeded in framing new provisions for insertion in the European
Communities (Amendment) Bill - certain to be strongly resisted by the
government - requiring a referendum to be held before the treaty is given
legal effect in the UK.
They will be debated towards the end of the committee stage of the bill,
which was resumed in the Commons yesterday amid further attempts to delay
its progress by anti-Maastricht MPs on both sides of the House.
Earlier attempts to include a referendum provision were ruled out of order,
and the favourable verdict secured by the latest version was hailed as a
'historic decision' by Mr Bill Cash (C Stafford), a leading opponent of the
bill.
Should MPs vote for a referendum, it would be financed by the taxpayer.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
have firmly opposed earlier calls for a referendum, but will be unable to
prevent sizeable numbers of their backbenchers voting for it.
Whatever the outcome of the Commons vote, ministers must now envisage that
the referendum demand will also be taken up in the House of Lords by Lady
Thatcher, the former prime minister, and some of her closest followers.
Liberal Democrat MPs, who with one exception are strong supporters of the
Maastricht treaty, have consistently backed demands for a referendum.
Mr Bryan Gould, who challenged Mr Smith for the Labour leadership and later
resigned from his shadow cabinet, is among prominent supporters of a
referendum on the opposition benches.
Mr Cash announced that the campaign in favour of a referendum would get
under way on Sunday with a march from Hyde Park in London to Trafalgar
Square, where MPs from the three main parties will address a rally.
Before debate was resumed on the bill in the Commons, Mr John Biffen (C
Shropshire North), the former cabinet minister, called for clarification of
the pledge given by the prime minister that the third reading would not take
place until after Denmark had held its second referendum on the Maastricht
treaty. He emphasised the uncertainties of the political situation in
Denmark.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, denied that
commitments arising from the Maastricht treaty meant that the British
government could be compelled to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism against
its will.
He clashed repeatedly with Mr Michael Spicer (C Worcestershire South),
another leading opponent of the bill, who argued that the issue would not be
determined by ministerial statements but by decisions made by the EC
Commission and the European Court.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Political Notebook: Counting the cost of timidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What price radicalism? Whatever the precise figure, it is apparently still
too high for the leaders of Britain's two main political parties.
Beneath the intellectual torpor at Westminster, it is possible to detect a
shared assumption running from left to right that economic realities have
stripped the credibility from their central political ambitions.
Senior figures on both sides will acknowledge in a whisper that sooner or
later they will have to confront the structural tensions in the nation's
finances: the inexorable rise in a Pounds 75bn welfare budget and the tax
privileges for pensions and home ownership that cost the Treasury more than
Pounds 15bn a year.
Of itself, economic recovery will deliver neither the scope for income tax
cuts central to the Conservative philosophy nor the money for the industrial
strategy and the fairer society pledged by the Labour party.
As the Treasury and Civil Service committee reminded us yesterday, something
has to give.
If it does not, the present pessimistic projections for the budget deficit
may prove to err on the side of optimism.
That much should be common ground, even if for obvious reasons Mr John Major
must still proclaim publicly that most of the deficit will melt away with
the return of economic growth.
But even three or four years away from a general election neither Mr Major
nor Mr John Smith will engage in a serious debate about how the financial
circle can be squared.
Universal state pension and child benefit payments, tax exemption for
occupational pension schemes and mortgage interest tax relief are issues
still judged off-limits for public consideration by politicians.
For all the talk of the 'Clintonising' of the Labour party and of the
plethora of new ideas at Mr Major's brainstorming sessions at Chequers,
these are issues to be discussed at a distance.
Mr Smith has handed them over to an independent Commission on Social
Justice. In spite of its distance from official Labour policy, the party
leader has felt it necessary to make clear from the outset that the party
does not want to tamper with universal benefits.
On the Tory side, the debate is being left to the think tanks and to a
handful of Thatcherite true believers.
There are some members of the cabinet willing to discuss in private a
radical reduction in income tax reliefs or the eventual means-testing of
universal benefits.
The horrifying deficit forecasts being churned out by the Treasury's
computers have re-focused attention on mortgage interest relief and on the
present exemptions from value added tax.
But the prevailing mood in 10 Downing Street is risk- averse. The government
remains, in the words of one minister, distinctly 'wobbly'. Potentially
unpopular decisions are pushed to the bottom of Mr Major's in-tray.
So it has been left to the independent thinkers on the back benches at
Westminster to articulate the arguments.
The first - and most radical - salvo has been fired not by the Tory right
but by Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead.
His central point is that Labour must turn on its head the traditional
preconception that an expanding welfare system is a measure of success.
Instead, the party should recognise it as an admission of failure.
Its concern should be with economic and social policies that pull people out
of the state safety net by spreading individual wealth as well as
employment.
Then comes the political ingenuity. Stealing some clothes from the Tory
right, Mr Field calls for what he terms the biggest-ever transfer of wealth
from corporate to individual hands: the unitisation of the Pounds 24bn in
occupational pension schemes to give every fund member ownership of their
share of the scheme.
The idea would be the logical conclusion of the shift to portable pensions
engineered by the Conservatives, marking the end of employer-controlled
final salary schemes.
That is only half the equation. Mr Field suggests that the huge transfer of
capital to individuals would provide the background for the phasing out of
the tax privileges of both pensions and mortgages.
The extra Pounds 15bn to Pounds 20bn in revenue could be used to allow
Labour to trump the Conservatives and pledge to slash the basic rate of
income tax by 10p to 15p in the pound. It would pave the way also for a cap
on the state pensions bill by allowing the targeting of future increases on
the poor.
It is an ambitious package. And Mr Field's conclusion that individual
ownership of pensions would nurture also a new culture of long-termism to
underpin Labour's industrial strategy may stretch credulity.
But Tory ministers are among those who admire its boldness. Mr Major and Mr
Smith should take note: the cost of timidity could well be higher than the
price of radicalism.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury report indicates stronger
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER DEMAND is strengthening slowly but the outlook for jobs remains
gloomy, according to the Treasury's latest monthly report of the economy.
In a generally cautious assessment of recent economic developments, the
Treasury points to higher car registrations, growth in the narrow measure of
the money supply and anecdotal evidence of a boost to sales over Christmas
as evidence that consumer activity is growing.
The trend in unemployment, however, has deteriorated since the early summer,
it says, with a particularly marked fall in service-sector employment
towards the end of last year.
The Treasury says that may reflect the sharp fall in confidence over the
summer and in September, rather than movements in output.
The report, the second of the Treasury's monthly assessments, prompted a
strong reaction from City economists who had been hoping for a more
analytical document.
'If this is the Treasury's idea of being more open, it's a complete
shambles,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg.
Mr Gwynn Haache, an economist at James Capel said: 'Ninety-nine per cent of
it is what we know already. It fails to say where the Treasury thinks the
economy is.'
The 45-page report is a round-up of recent economic statistics but offers
little insight into Treasury thinking. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
introduced the report in the aftermath of Britain's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism last year. It was one of several measures
designed to improve openness at the Treasury.
The report gave no indication on interest rate moves.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on lottery funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR MP warned yesterday that the National Lottery may not be as
successful financially as ministers are assuming.
Mr Joe Ashton, MP for Bassetlaw, told Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, that the numbers 'just don't add up'.
Mr Ashton, speaking at a national heritage committee hearing, said that
suggestions of a Pounds 1.5bn turnover with prize money of about Pounds 14m
a week looked 'phenomenally optimistic.'
Apart from high start-up costs, it might be possible to equip only 10,000
retail outlets with the necessary computers in the first year. Smaller shops
and pubs would have to sell thousands of tickets to meet such a target.
Mr Brooke said the Pounds 1.5bn figure had been illustrative. If that turned
out to be the turnover, then prize money of Pounds 14m a week would be
possible, because the payouts of many lotteries around the world varied from
48 per cent to 52 per cent of revenue, he said.
A number of MPs also expressed concern yesterday at the effect the lottery
might have on the football pools and in particular their requests for 'a
level playing field'.
Although he repeated previous statements that the government would keep an
open mind as the National Lottery bill went through parliament, Mr Brooke
did not appear to hold out much hope on the main changes the pools companies
are asking for.
Mr Brooke said that if the government started adjusting, that might damage
the lottery's chances of success. If pools companies were allowed to
advertise on television the government 'would receive pressure that all
gambling should be allowed to advertise.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press for scrutiny of security
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL from a Commons committee for parliament to scrutinise Britain's
security services was not rejected outright by Downing Street last night -
in spite of past objections from Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary.
After a report from the home affairs select committee, the prime minister's
office said the contents of planned legislation remained undecided.
Its reaction came although Mr Clarke had told that committee during its
inquiry: 'I do not believe that it would be right to make the security
service accountable to a select committee of this house.'
The report says inquiries into value-for-money of security services and its
general policy 'are proper subjects for parliamentary scrutiny as long as
(it) does not damage the effectiveness of the service'.
The MPs proposed that they should take responsibility for overseeing MI5,
the domestic security service, but indicated that they would accept a
special Commons committee covering overseas security operations and the
electronics eavesdropping operations of GCHQ as well.
The planned legislation is to put overseas security services on a statutory
footing but could be extended to include parliamentary accountability.
Security operations will cost at least Pounds 185m in 1992-93, the report
says, and increasingly MI5 is taking over responsibilities - such as for
countering IRA terrorism. But they are accountable to parliament via
ministers who usually refuse to answer questions about their operations.
The committee rejects the setting up of a committee of privy councillors,
inside or outside parliament, as a watchdog for the security services.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Tory chairman, said his committee already had powers to
scrutinise MI5 because its terms of reference covered 'the Home Office and
its associated public bodies'. By convention, however, questions had not
been asked and he did not want to provoke a confrontation.
Attempts by the committee to call Mrs Stella Rimington, head of MI5, to give
evidence have been blocked by Mr Clarke. Instead, six of its members are to
meet her for lunch.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party backing for action
against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE western allies began a limited air strike against Iraq, the
government last night secured effective cross-party support for military
action, provided that the measures were in compliance with international
law.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told MPs that Iraq had 'not complied
with the representations made to them on the southern no-fly zone, they have
violated the border with Kuwait, they have moved missiles into northern
Iraq'.
He promised that measures taken 'would need to be and would be in full
compliance with the international law.'
Britain hoped that the Iraqi regime 'will not miscalculate, that the
violations of the border will cease immediately . . . and that Iraq will
comply with the United Nations,' Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister,
later added.
For Labour, Mr George Robertson, foreign affairs spokesman, said there was
widespread international agreement that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's recent
conduct had been 'designed as deliberate and calculated provocation by a
despicable regime'.
Emphasising there was 'no question at all' that Saddam must comply with the
provisions of UN resolutions, he said Labour would continue to support the
air exclusion zones and their enforcement. He welcomed the government's
assurance that action would be in accordance with international law.
Two Labour MPs - Mr Tam Dalyell and Mr George Galloway - formally exempted
themselves from the frontbench consensus on last night's action. Mr Dalyell
said that Egypt and Bahrain 'do not support us in military action in these
circumstances.'
Sir David Steel, for the Liberal Democrats, said it was important that the
government enjoyed cross-party support for 'whatever action they take in an
international context against Saddam Hussein'.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, former shadow foreign secretary, said many MPs would
support action to ensure Iraq obeyed ceasefire resolutions - 'provided
civilians are protected'.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, meanwhile, pressed Mr Hurd
regarding newspaper reports that he had 'personally authorised a visit to
Britain from people from Iraq to discuss the purchase with GEC of
telecommunications systems'.
Mr Hurd said it was certain that neither he nor a colleague would authorise
action 'which could have led anyone . . . to believe it was correct or
possible under our law to break the sanctions of the UN'.

DRINKS trade leaders yesterday warned of devastation to their industry
unless the chancellor freezes or cuts taxes on alcohol in the March Budget.
They said the EC single market made it essential that the industry was given

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mental health review announced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN urgent review is to be conducted into whether new legal powers are needed
to ensure that the mentally ill get proper care in the community, Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said last night.
In a Commons written reply, Mrs Bottomley said that the Royal College of
Psychiatrists had recommended the 1983 Mental Health Act should be amended
to provide for a community supervision order. That would apply for patients
repeatedly admitted to hospital who needed long-term support in the
community but had a history of failing to co-operate with treatment.
'We do need to address, as a priority, whether we are doing enough to ensure
that these vulnerable people keep in contact with the services available,'
Mrs Bottomley said.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confidence in business declines in
Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in Scotland declined slightly in the last quarter of
1992 and demand contracted in almost all sectors, according to the latest
quarterly survey of Scottish business opinion, James Buxton writes.
The survey, by Scotland's chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of
Allander Institute, Scotland's principal economic research organisation,
said business confidence fell in manufacturing, distribution and tourism.
There was a slight increase in confidence in construction, but from a low
base.
The only sector to report buoyant and rising demand was manufactured
exports.
Expectations for the first quarter of 1993 are for a continuation of
recessionary conditions but with a slower rate of contraction than in the
last quarter of 1992.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Low oil prices hit North Sea activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW OIL prices forced significant cuts in exploration activity by North Sea
oil and gas producers last year, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie,
the Edinburgh brokers.
North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last
year, compared with more than 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices
and an adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced
them to cut capital expenditure.
The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year
and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled.
Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when
companies experience hard times. Oil prices were at a 20-year low in real
terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel.
At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose
significantly. That should have a positive effect over the longer term
because money spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more
revenue in the next five years as production rises.
Producers' cashflow was low last year at Pounds 800m compared with an
average of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of
the increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie
is an estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus
exploration and development costs and taxation.
Oil production reached a three-year high of 1.9m barrels a day last year and
Wood Mackenzie sees further growth over the next five years.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Truck sales revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND DAF, part of the Dutch commercial vehicles group, last year
strengthened the UK truck market leadership it wrested from Iveco Ford in
1991, John Griffiths writes.
Its share of the market for trucks over 3.5 tonnes rose by 1.8 percentage
points to 25.7 per cent, whereas Iveco Ford's share fell marginally to 23.45
per cent.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show last
year to have been the worst on record for the industry, with sales down 2.44
per cent to 31,398, less than half 1989 levels. Sales of all commercial
vehicles were down by 3.75 per cent compared with 1991, to 201,186 from
209,021.
The full-year figures obscure what now appears to be developing into a
sustained upturned for the industry.
Truck sales in December rose for the sixth successive month, by 7.9 per cent
compared with December of last year.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Most unionists 'in white-collar jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST trade unionists are now non-manual workers and have educational
qualifications of A level or equivalent, while 23 per cent have a university
degree or equivalent.
The 1991 Labour Force Survey, published today in the Department of
Employment's Employment Gazette, estimates that 53 per cent of union members
have full-time white-collar jobs and only 24 per cent work in manufacturing.
The figures reflect the higher levels of unionisation in the public sector
among health, teaching and central and local-government professionals.
Union density among those at work has fallen to 33 per cent but the gender
gap is narrowing. In 1991 42 per cent of men at work belonged to a union
compared with 32 per cent of women. In 1948 fewer than 20 per cent of trade
unionists were women. That proportion has risen to 40 per cent.
Unions continue to find it hard to recruit part-time workers - only 22 per
cent belong to a union - but 23 per cent of part-time women workers were in
unions, compared with 12 per cent of men. The study also shows that workers
under 24 are less likely to be in unions than other age groups. Thirty-seven
per cent of workers, including the unemployed and self-employed, were trade
unionists in 1991, the fewest since the middle of the Second World War and
15 percentage points less than in 1978, when membership peaked.
Northern England has the highest union density, with 46 per cent of the
workforce unionised. The lowest is in East Anglia, with 25 per cent. While
33 per cent of white workers were in unions, 46 per cent of West
Indian/Guyanese, 33 per cent of Indians and 27 per cent of
Pakistani/Bangladeshi workers were unionised. Employment Gazette. HMSO.

FT  14 JAN 93 / George Walker's Pall Mall home up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker's former Pall Mall penthouse home, is up for sale with a
price tag of Pounds 1.45m, Maggie Urry writes.
Mr Walker, once chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the property
and leisure group, was last week arrested on charges of theft and false
account-ing.
He and his wife Jean had already vacated the flat, on the fifth and sixth
floor of the Palladian-style building, which overlooks St James's.
The flat has four reception rooms, including a 'rather grand drawing room'
according to Mellersh &amp; Harding, the agents, also four bedrooms and three
bathrooms.
Reports that Mr and Mrs Walker removed the kitchen they had installed,
before departing, are borne out by the agent's particulars which say the
kitchen 'requires complete renovation'.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Under 21s slip behind in pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST detailed survey of the effect of removing young people from the
protection of wages councils, which set minimum pay rates for about 2.5m
workers, has found that their pay fell relative to older workers in two out
of three sectors.
People under 21 years were removed from the Wages Councils in a reform of
the system in 1986. The Employment Bill going through its committee stage in
the Commons seeks to abolish the wages councils completely.
Department of Employment research on the effects of removing
under-21-year-olds concluded that there was no evidence of systematic falls
in the pay of young people relative to the pay of employees aged 21 years
and over.
In the hotel and catering sector, however, the pay of young male workers
fell 4.6 per cent between 1986 and 1992 and the pay of young female workers
fell 9.7 per cent when compared with workers over 21.
In retailing, the pay of young male workers fell 1.1 per during the period
while that of young female workers fell 2.2 per relative to pay for older
workers.
The pay of young male sales assistants rose 4.3 percentage points more than
for older workers and that for young female hairdressers rose 2.8 per cent
more than for older workers.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Braer's oil dispersed by storms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STORMS that finally broke up the oil tanker Braer on Tuesday appear to
have dispersed most of the remaining crude oil the tanker was carrying,
leaving much of the sea around Shetland clear yesterday.
Oil pollution officials who flew over the area near Sumburgh Head yesterday
reported an 80 per cent reduction in visible oil pollution in the sea,
although there were signs of heavier pollution closer to the wreck.
Mr David Bedborough of the Department of Transport's marine pollution unit
said he thought the effects of wind and waves had dispersed the oil deep
into the sea. Before the ship began breaking up on Monday, it was thought at
least half its cargo of 84,000 tonnes of light crude oil was still on board.
The Duke of Edinburgh, who visited Shetland yesterday with the Prince of
Wales, said what had happened was 'a very serious incident as opposed to a
major ecological disaster which it could have been'.
The Duke, who is president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said that in
ecological terms its effects were much less serious than the Exxon Valdez
disaster off Alaska in 1989. Whereas in Alaska about 300,000 guillemots
alone were killed, as well as many other species of birds and mammals, the
toll in Shetland was far smaller.
The latest casualty list is 691 dead sea birds, 212 live but oiled birds,
two dead grey seals and three contaminated by oil, and two dead otters.
Mr George Sutherland, the Shetland local authority's director of marine
operations, said the oil had not contaminated very many beaches. Most were
affected by a slick of brownish foam.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, yesterday renewed its calls to the oil
industry to take action to prevent further spills in the wake of the Braer
disaster. In a letter to British Petroleum it called on the company to keep
tankers away from the Shetland and Orkney islands and the Hebrides.
The letter was sent in response to a leaked internal memo from BP advising
managers to 'keep their heads down' over the Braer disaster and not to be
drawn into a debate about tanker safety.
However, the memo, which states it is 'not, repeat not, for the press', goes
on to say that BP believes more attention should be paid internationally to
the prevention of accidents. The company wants action taken to improve
tanker traffic control, ship navigation and better training programmes for
personnel.
Yesterday the tank-barge Tak 10 was sheltering off Caithness, ready to
remove any oil still trapped within the Braer. It was thought that much of
the Braer's 1,600 tonnes of fuel oil may still be on board.
Specialist equipment for detecting air pollution levels was flown to
Shetland from Edinburgh yesterday.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Rosyth fears loss of Trident repair contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT of Scotland's Rosyth naval dockyard said yesterday it
believed the Ministry of Defence favoured awarding crucial submarine work to
the rival Devonport yard at Plymouth.
But Mr David Batty, a Rosyth director, denied that it had received any
formal indication of the ministry's conclusion. The future of the two
government-owned yards, which are operated by separate private-sector
groups, is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers next week.
Mr Batty said it appeared that the government had no intention of closing
either yard. He added: 'Rosyth really must have nuclear submarine refitting
if it is to have any sort of viable future.'
Signs were 'not at all that good' for Rosyth, he said. The yard is managed
by Babcock Thorn, majority-owned and controlled by Babcock International.
A Devonport official warned, however: 'It is far too early to celebrate. As
far as we are concerned, a decision has not been taken.' DML, the management
company, is a consortium of the Weir group, BICC and Brown and Root of the
US.
The Ministry of Defence also said that the decision, which was postponed at
the end of last year, remained open. The government is expected to offer the
losing yard guarantees of work on refitting surface ships over the medium
term, but neither considers that it can afford to lose lucrative nuclear
submarine work.
A decision has been forced by naval cuts and the need for new docking
facilities to accommodate the UK's large new Trident ballistic missile
submarines.
Rosyth sprang a surprise in December by tabling a fresh proposal which, like
Devonport's, would be based on refurbishing existing docks rather than
completing new ones. That would involve estimated capital expenditure of
Pounds 147m, compared with the company's previous plan to finish a
purpose-built dock complex for Pounds 267m.
Three of Britain's biggest construction and engineering groups have filed
protective claims approaching Pounds 200m against the Ministry of Defence to
cover cost overruns on the Faslane nuclear submarine base on the Clyde.
Trafalgar House, which is understood to have issued a writ for about Pounds
120m, said yesterday: 'These claims are essentially technical to protect the
companies' position. Discussions are continuing with the Ministry of Defence
to resolve any differences and are proceeding satisfactorily.'
Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering is understood to have claimed Pounds 50m
and Babcock Contractors about Pounds 20m.
Proceedings have arisen because under Scottish law companies are required to
file claims within five years from the start of a contract. Work started at
Faslane in 1987 but has been seriously delayed.
Up to 600 jobs are likely to be lost under Ministry of Defence plans to
establish a single army personnel centre in Glasgow by 1995.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Heseltine clashes over French link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over the practicality of scrapping arrangements which enable France to
supply up to 6 per cent of electricity sold in England and Wales has broken
out between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr
Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee.
In a letter to Mr Caborn, a Labour MP, dated December 29, the trade and
industry secretary played down the prospect of any such move, saying it 'may
in the end offer no solutions'.
Mr Heseltine said he had received legal advice that 'legislative measures to
prevent trade in electricity from France to England would constitute a
breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome'.
He added: 'That being so, the measures could result in successful infraction
proceedings against the government and in claims for damages by one or more
injured party' for example, Electricite de France, the French state-owned
utility, or electricity suppliers in the UK.
Mr Heseltine said: 'As you will realise, this would be a serious matter and
not one the government would wish to provoke.'
He was 'still considering the overall question of whether it would be
desirable for changes to be made to the existing arrangements as they affect
trade in electricity across the interconnector'.
In his response, dated January 6, Mr Caborn said evidence received by the
cross-party committee did not correspond to the legal advice Mr Heseltine
had received and that 'the legal situation appears less clear-cut than your
letter suggests'.
He said: 'Removing the non-leviable status of French electricity would
presumably be a matter for the UK, and would not come under the heading of
'restricting trade between Member States of the European Community'.'
He added: 'Freedom to trade between member states must be reciprocal . . .
as we understand it, there is no opportunity for UK generators to export to
France or through France to other countries.'

The allegations, including claims that large sums were offered in exchange
for commercial and residential planning permissions, were referred to the
police late last year by the council's chief executive, Mr Bill Samuel. His
action followed reports to him by members of the planning committee
concerned about offers of bribes made to them.
No charges have yet been brought. In a statement, the council said
yesterday: 'It is entirely a matter for the CPS as to whether any further

THE government's data protection registrar has launched an investigation
into allegations that British Airways illegally gained access to Virgin
Atlantic's computer system, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, confirmed yesterday that he had
written to Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, requesting further
details. 'We are trying to find out the facts,' he said.
His inquiry was sparked by newspaper reports of claims by Mr Branson that BA
had examined Virgin's computer data as part of a series of activities
'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice'.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday called for Lord
King, BA chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, deputy chairman, to resign after
a 'campaign of deceit, lies and illegal activities' carried out by BA
against Mr Branson and Virgin Atlantic.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S data protection registrar has launched an investigation
into allegations that British Airways illegally gained access to Virgin
Atlantic's computer system.
Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, confirmed yesterday that he had
written to Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, requesting further
details.
'We are trying to find out the facts,' he said.
His inquiry was prompted by newspaper reports of claims by Mr Branson that
BA had examined Virgin's computer data as part of a series of activities
'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice'.
Under the 1984 Data Protection Act, anyone storing data about individuals on
computer is required to register, stating the purpose and those to whom the
data can be given.
It is a criminal offence to fail to register, and use the data for other
purposes or give it to unauthorised users 'knowingly or recklessly'. That is
punishable by fines of up to Pounds 5,000 in the magistrates courts or
unlimited levels in the High Court.
The Data Protection Registrar confirmed last night that it had one
registration for Virgin, 11 for BA and one for BA Enterprises.
The registrar can also issue enforcement acts against breaches of
guidelines, for instance if data has not been obtained fairly and lawfully,
or is not held securely and is not accurate or relevant.
The administrators to Air Europe, the charter group that collapsed in March
1991, were co-operating with Virgin in the period before the settlement
against BA, it has emerged.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Low oil prices hit N Sea exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW OIL prices forced significant cuts in exploration activity by North Sea
oil and gas producers last year, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie,
the Edinburgh brokers.
North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last
year, compared with over 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices and an
adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced them
to cut capital expenditure.
The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year
and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled.
Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when
companies experience hard times, and oil prices were at a 20-year low in
real terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel.
At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose
significantly. That will prove positive over the longer term because money
spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more revenue in
the next five years as production rises.
Producers' cashflow was low in 1992 at Pounds 800m compared with an average
of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of the
increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie is an
estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus exploration and
development costs and taxation.
Oil production reached a three-year high of 1.9m barrels a day (b/d) last
year and Wood Mackenzie sees further growth over the next five years. Gas
production last year dropped slightly to 4,859bn cu ft a day compared with
5,100bn in 1991.
The bulk of new investment in the North Sea will be in developing gas
fields, and offshore operators estimate that two thirds of the industry's
investment will be spent on gas by the end of the decade.
Wood Mackenzie also points out that the level of mergers and acquisitions
among North Sea operators dropped sharply last year to Pounds 174m from
Pounds 1.8bn in 1991, again reflecting cash constraints.

MR John Hougham, the 55-year-old head of employee relations at Ford UK, is
to become chairman of Acas, the government conciliation service, David
Goodhart writes.
Mr Hougham beat a strong field, including Ms Brenda Dean, the former print

expected to be formally announced by the Department of Employment today.
Mr Hougham is a respected negotiator who has been at Ford since 1963. One
senior trade unionist said yesterday: 'He has a reputation as a bit of a
tough guy and he has certainly been in some big fights at Ford, but he is
well respected on both sides of industry.'

FT  14 JAN 93 / Embarrassment for President-elect Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week's inaugural celebrations lost a party yesterday and left
President-elect Bill Clinton somewhat embarrassed. A planned Sunday gala
honouring Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary-designate, and Democrat party
chairman for four years, was cancelled over controversy about corporate
funding for the event.
He has come under attack for his Washington lobbying business, including
representing foreign companies, and for the severance terms he has arranged
from his law firm.
This probably does not threaten his nomination, but news of the gala, with a
US subsidiary of Sony of Japan covering some costs, appeared to compound
suspicions of conflicts of interest.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US secretary of state-designate, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday
promised to give economic concerns and the promotion of US commercial
interests overseas a much higher profile in his conduct of foreign policy.
Economic competition, he told the Senate foreign relations committee in a
confirmation hearing, was eclipsing ideological rivalry as an essential
ingredient in world affairs. 'For too long, we have made economics the poor
cousin of foreign policy.'
He said US embassies needed more than just one commercial officer helping US
companies. Equally, the former Soviet republics and the countries of eastern
Europe should have greater US public and private commitment and expertise in
order to facilitate their transitions into market democracies.
Mr Christopher's prepared testimony, the delivery of which was delayed by
opening and mostly complimentary statements by committee members, made much
of the imperative to connect domestic and foreign policies. 'I have long
thought the State Department needs an American desk - and I'll be sitting at
that desk.'
He offered no new doctrine to guide foreign policy, but spoke of three
fundamental realities - pursuit of economic growth, maintenance of a strong
and adaptable military, and a commitment to 'build democracy from the bottom
up' around the world.
The use of force overseas, he said, was 'a vexing question.' Its deployment
should generally be 'discreet and careful' and the threat of its use
'credible'. The Cold War had been won by 'harnessing diplomacy and power
together', he said.
Mr Christopher added that the UN could not be an effective instrument unless
it had full US support - and he promised that the US would pay its
outstanding arrears.
In his tour d'horizon, Mr Christopher also promised:
Support for the reform process in Russia and other former Soviet republics
and satellites, conditional on their acceptance of the principles of a
market democracy. Collapse of the Russian economy 'could fatally discredit
democracy'.
Continued commitment to Nato while new security structures in Europe were
evolving, hopefully to include eastern European nations.
To do what was necessary to ensure 'a peaceful and broad transition to
democracy' in China, which, he said, was economically booming but still
created problems in its human rights and weapons sales policies and trade
protectionism.
Particular attention to Japan, with the purpose of ensuring together that
regional trading blocs militating against global growth were avoided.
'Unswerving' commitment to the security of Israel and the Middle East peace
process.
At the end of his testimony, Mr Christopher also addressed one issue that
has cast a minor cloud over his nomination: what he knew, while deputy
attorney general in the late 1960s, of covert domestic surveillance by the
US Army.
He said he had no knowledge of the kinds of activities that emerged after he
left office, he stood by his testimony to the Senate foreign relations
committee in 1977, and would not tolerate such activities by his State
Department.

FT  14 JAN 93 / China forges Peruvian links with Dollars 312m steel accord:
A 'vanguard' purchase transforms Lima's privatisation programme. But the
trade balance is likely to remain strongly in Peru's favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHINA made its largest single investment in Latin America with its recent
purchase of Peru's state-owned iron producer, Hierro Peru, acquired by
Shougang Corporation for Dollars 312m (Pounds 205m)
Already China's largest steel producer, Shougang has set itself the goal of
becoming world leader in steel production, projecting output in excess of
20m tonnes by the end of the century. The Peruvian purchase aims to ensure
raw materials supply for the expanding steel industry.
Shougang was determined to secure the iron producer as the offer price
dramatically exceeds the Peruvian privatisation office's most optimistic
expectations. It more than quadruples the entire revenue earned last year
from sell-offs of state-owned assets.
'We should be jumping for joy,' said former Peruvian trade and industry
minister, Mr Victor Joy Way, an expert in Asian trade and the son of Chinese
immigrants. Mr Joy Way says several delegations of Chinese entrepreneurs
have recently visited Peru. The Chinese are 'interested in investing in
anything and everything,' he says.
Electricity generation (possibly from Chinese-patented 'liquefied coal'),
heavy machinery, petrochemicals and telecommunications are among possible
priority sectors.
Several factors have come together to allow the commercial alliance. Peru's
economic and (relative) political stability plus progress towards curbing
terrorism have coincided with greater Chinese openness and a need to seek
raw materials and markets abroad.
'We in China find Peru more interesting every day,' said a senior Shougang
executive at the auction. 'Many Chinese companies are preparing to invest
here in the near future - we are just the vanguard.'
Shougang's bid had Peru's new breed of economic liberals bristling at the
irony of what is essentially state enterprise leading the field in their
country's long-awaited privatisation process. But Shougang's investment -
including a steel mill and associated industrial complex to manufacture
spare parts - should provide a boost for Peru's recession-hit economy.
One of Hierro Peru's attractions for Shougang is the deep-water port of San
Nicolas which serves the Marcona mine. Shougang has a huge shipping fleet
and, as iron output increases, will deploy 30 ships full-time ferrying coal
and iron between Peru and China.
Possibilities for future development of sea-freight services are virtually
limitless, say Lima-based representatives.
Shougang is one of China's largest conglomerates. Among more than a dozen
different economic activities, its prominent interests are in steel-making,
machinery and equipment manufacture, shipping, minerals processing and
electronics. According to Shougang executives the conglomerate owns over a
100 factories and 16 transnationals in a dozen different countries.
Its direct workforce exceeds 200,000.
Shougang's current steel-making capacity is for 10m tonnes a year, and it
produces 200,000 tonnes of machinery. It exports to some 40 countries, and
foreign exchange earnings are expected to top Dollars 350m this year. Global
sales are forecast to reach Dollars 4bn a year by 1995.
Modern-day trade relations between Peru and China began in 1972, during the
left-wing military government of General Juan Velasco. Since China is a
leading buyer of Peruvian fishmeal, the trade balance has always strongly
favoured Peru. Last year Peru exported products worth Dollars 291m to China;
imports were only Dollars 33m.
Chinese trade officials in Lima say this pattern is likely to continue.
Increased shipping movements between the two countries could provide
Peruvian minerals with an expanded outlet in Asian markets.
Following a visit to China last year by President Alberto Fujimori several
new credit lines were extended. These have recently resulted in a large
purchase by Peru of Chinese tractors. In the next six months, Peru's tractor
stock will be increased by around 40 per cent with the arrival of some 3,000
Chinese-built tractors worth around Dollars 25m.
Many of the sewing-machines Mr Fujimori hands out on electioneering visits
to the Peruvian hinterland are also Chinese-made.
Shougang representatives in Lima say that, within a couple of years, Peru
could be building sought-after 'Chinese' tractors for export to other Latin
American countries.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Bahamas' former leader blamed for economic turmoil: 'Fiscal
recklessness' is claimed as public indebtedness soars, tourism declines and
offshore financial services face stiff competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE once-vibrant economy of the Bahamas is looking shaky. Prime Minister
Hubert Ingraham, elected in August, has been very firm about where the blame
lies: his predecessor, Sir Lynden Pindling, who had held office for 25
years.
Mr Ingraham has charged that the country's finances are in 'chaos' because
of the 'fiscal recklessness' of the previous government, which had borrowed
to cover its deficits over the past four years.
But getting out of the economic quicksand will present the new prime
minister with no small test of his administrative skills.
The options are few for the narrowly-based Bahamaian econ-omy.
Just after taking office, Mr Ingraham reported the government's
embarrassment at being unable to release Dollars 33m in cheques it had
written because all its accounts were overdrawn.
'It is unacceptable for the public treasury of a sovereign state to be in a
scandalous position whereby cheques are written to pay government bills, but
cannot be released because there is no money in the government's overdrawn
bank accounts for the cheques to be honoured,' the prime minister said.
Faced with a fiscal deficit last year of Dollars 240m (Pounds 158m), 8.5 per
cent of GDP, Mr Ingraham's government has spent the past four months
reviewing the practices of Sir Lynden's government.
'The information coming to hand confirms what has been common knowledge in
the Bahamas; that there has been, for years, serious mismanagement and
misuse of the public finances; and that there has been impropriety, and
extraordinary extravagance, abysmal neglect and waste in the handling of the
economy, and of the public finances,' Mr Ingraham said.
The economy has suffered in recent years from a decline in tourism, its main
pillar, caused mainly by recession in its main markets. The offshore
financial services sector has not fared well in the face of increased
competition from neighbouring tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands.
The Bahamas' fiscal deficit jumped eight-fold between 1986 and 1989, was cut
by a half in 1990 and then almost doubled again in 1991 and 1992. Foreign
debt has doubled in the past three years.
Representatives of the opposition party have suggested that Mr Ingraham has
been overstating the problem and has not taken account of the economic
problems which forced Sir Lynden's administration into extensive deficit
financing. 'He is still campaigning for an election he has already won,'
said one.
There are no quick solutions available to the prime minister. Ironically, he
has been forced into much the same action taken by Sir Lynden, saying: 'A
further Dollars 100m must be borrowed as a matter of the most extreme
urgency.'
He also announced that the government is divesting some enterprises
including one hotel and some port facilities, and will seek to manage the
country's accounts with 'fiscal rectitude'.
The prime minister has ruled out changes to the country's tax regime, in
which incomes are not taxed, and has instead suggested increased efficiency
in tax collection methods, especially for customs duties which account for
about 70 per cent of the government's revenue.
There appears little he can do immediately about Bahamasair, the troubled
state-owned airline, for which the government is providing Dollars 51m in
financial support by June. The government is also concerned about loans of
Dollars 150m contracted by the state-owned Hotel Corporation, the largest
hotel owner in the country, and the need for another Dollars 28m to complete
the expansion of the international airport, as the Dollars 58m budgeted for
it had been spent.
Mr Ingraham's charges of 'impropriety' are unlikely to excite the 245,000
people of the Bahamas. In his last decade in office, Sir Lynden was
frequently forced to defend the government, and himself, against local and
American accusations of benefiting from narcotics trafficking and money
laundering.
Sir Lynden has always rejected the accusations, but Mr Ingraham's latest
charge that Dollars 8m had been taken from the national coffers and secreted
in a bank in the US will again force Sir Lynden on the defensive. The prime
minister told parliament that the money had been put into 'someone's
personal account'. He mentioned no names.

FT  14 JAN 93 / IDA to sharpen focus on poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Development Association (IDA) - the World Bank's
concessional finance affiliate - will focus more directly on specific
measures to reduce poverty and promote environmentally sustainable
development, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, pledged yesterday.
The IDA provides highly concessional loans for the poorest countries - those
with per capita annual incomes of Dollars 765 (Pounds 503) or less.
Mr Preston said the share of IDA resources devoted to social projects and
direct poverty reduction would be steadily increased. He said poor people
affected by programmes should play a bigger role in helping design projects.
His restatement of IDA goals followed formal board approval of the 10th
replenishment of IDA resources, covering the three years starting this July.
Donor nations have agreed to provide SDR13bn (Pounds 11.83bn). This
represents a small increase in resources compared with IDA 9, which was
SDR11.7bn.
However, in per capita terms the latest replenishment is less generous than
IDA 9 because funds will have to be spread over more recipients; newly
qualifying nations include several former Soviet republics. Donors also
failed to provide an additional 'earth increment' to fund more ambitious
environmental policies.
Mr Preston praised donors for not forgetting the needs of the poorest
countries, in spite of severe budgetary restraints at home. Officials said
the overall replenishment would have been smaller but for a surprisingly
large commitment from the Bush administration, which pledged Dollars 3.75bn,
nearly 20 per cent more than its dollar contribution to IDA 9.
Britain's contribution of Pounds 620m represented only 6.1 per cent of total
resources committed, down from 6.7 per cent of IDA 9.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: US warns of more raids if Iraq transgresses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, HIGH WYCOMBE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT'S air raids against Iraq targeted only missile batteries and
associated infrastructure. But, said the White House, Mr Marlin Fitzwater,
the US stood ready to take 'additional forceful actions' with its allies if
Iraq continued to flout 'the will of the international community.'
Some officials within the Bush administration had advocated a more violent
response, possibly extending to the annihilation of an entire army division.
Yesterday's operation was 'a spanking, not a full beating' they said.
A US general last night expressed cautious optimism about the results of the
raid.
General Joseph Hoar, commander in chief of US Central Command, which
supervises the Middle East region, said the attack, involving 80 strike
aircraft and 30 support planes, had targeted either mobile surface to air
missile batteries or stationary air defence facilities in the regions of
Telil, Samawah, Najaf and al-Amarah.
He said the aircraft had taken off from a number of sites in the Arabian
peninsula, as well as from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, but declined to
say which other countries, besides the US, UK and France, had participated
in the raid.
Coalition planes had encountered a small amount of anti-aircraft artillery
fire, but no missiles, he said, adding that it would take several hours to
analyse film and assess the results of the raid.
At the RAF Command Centre in High Wycombe, Air Chief Marshal Sir John
Thomson, chief of RAF Strike Command, said the operation appeared to have
been 'commendably successful'.
It was very similar to many undertaken in the 1991 Gulf campaign although on
a relatively limited scale. The attacks had been calculated to create a
minimum chance of 'collateral damage' - meaning civilian casualties.
Four RAF Tornado GR1 bombers took part in the attack on the al-Amarah base
just south of the 32nd parallel. They dropped six 1,000lb laser-guided bombs
from medium level on two parts of the site. All the crews returned safely.
US administration officials over the last few days have been at pains to
portray Iraq's actions as forming a pattern of provocation: attacks on
United Nations relief operations; flights in the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq; threatening missile movements; unauthorised incursions across the
Kuwaiti border; and impermissible restrictions on UN weapons inspectors.
The air strikes however, made it clear that there are two types of
provocation: those which threaten allied pilots, and those which do not. Mr
Fitzwater said yesterday that the raid came in response to Iraq's failure to
comply with the 48-hour ultimatum issued on January 6 by the three allies,
in conjunction with Russia, demanding the withdrawal of missiles from the
southern no-fly zone.
Although US officials claimed over the weekend that Iraq had, indeed,
removed these anti-aircraft missiles, that ultimatum was subsequently
breached. 'The coalition is acting to restore an environment which poses no
threat to coalition aircraft,' Mr Fitzwater said.
Mr Fitzwater mentioned only in passing Iraq's repeated flouting of Monday's
Security Council warning against incursions into Kuwait; indeed, he made it
clear that President George Bush's decision to bomb Iraq had been taken on
Monday, before the Security Council issued its statement.
However, the dispatch of a battalion-strength US task force to Kuwait may
provide some more forceful backing to the unarmed UN observer mission
manning the Iraq-Kuwait border.
General Hoar said, however, that the battalion, from the 1st Cavalry
Division at Fort Worth, Texas, would not enter the demilitarised zone along
the border, but would conduct exercises with Kuwaiti forces in an area
northwest of Kuwait City.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQI President Saddam Hussein today called for a holy war against western
aggressors and urged his air defences to strike back after US-led raids
against southern Iraq, James Whittington and Reuter report from Baghdad.
Addressing the nation on state television early this morning after the air
attacks, he said any US or western aircraft in Iraqi airspace was a target.
The Iraqi leader made no mention of casualties in the raids, but later the
Iraqi news agency said one soldier and three civilians had been killed and
four wounded in the province of Basra.
'Fight on against the aggressors. . . so that Iraqi airspace from the north
to the south, from the east to the west, is turned into fiery lava,' he
said.
As the president spoke there appeared to be few signs in Baghdad that the
capital was preparing for attack.
In a five star hotel a newly wed couple danced the night away apparently
convinced that there was little or no chance of a renewed outbreak of
full-scale war.
Dressed in a field marshal's uniform, Mr Saddam said: 'They want, through
their vicious aggression, to impose the will of colonialism and rape the
will of nations. They have come to say to Iraqis: You have no choice but to
give in to evil.'
The opposition Iraqi National Congress (INC), made up of liberal Arabs and
Kurds, last night expressed support for allied military action against Iraq,
writes Gareth Smyth in London.
'Any military strike that weakens Saddam Hussein will be welcomed by the
Iraqi people,' said spokesman Ahmed Chalabi. 'The noose must be tightened
around him.'

FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Air strike proves successful says UK premier
</HEADLINE>

MR JOHN MAJOR said last night the air strikes had been 'limited and
proportionate' but appeared to have been successful.
He warned President Saddam Hussein that the allies would strike again if the
Iraqi leader continued to defy the United Nations.
The UK prime minister, who spoke to President George Bush by telephone after
the attack, won support from the Labour and Liberal Democrat frontbenches
for the attack.
He said there had been no allied casualties among US, British and French
forces and that all aircraft had returned safely.
Preliminary signs were that the mission had achieved its objectives, Mr
Major said in Downing Street.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told the Commons later, that 'early
indications are that serious damage was inflicted.'
However, the near consensus at Westminster was spoilt by protests from
left-wing Labour MPs that the attack might strengthen Mr Saddam's position
in Iraq and could encourage Islamic fundamentalism.
The government said the attack on surface-to-air missiles and command and
control facilities in southern Iraq had been taken in 'self-defence' to
protect allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zone to enforce UN
resolutions.
It said Iraqi activity would be scrutinised - and that no further warning
would be given if Iraq's aircraft and missiles posed a threat to coalition
aircraft operating south of the 32nd parallel.
Mr Rifkind said Britain would continue to take part in discussions at the UN
about Iraqi incursions into the demilitaried zone on the border with Kuwait.
He told the Commons that four RAF Tornado strike aircraft and two Victor
tankers took part in the raid, which followed Iraq's deployment of missiles
in a 'threatening posture'. He won enthusiastic backing from Tory MPs.
Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said 'the only correct course. .
. . was to take those missiles out of action,' adding: 'We cannot have the
will of the UN challenged with impunity.'
Some Tories wanted still greater pressure applied. Sir George Gardiner
(Conservative, Reigate) said: 'The time will come when we need, not only to
give Saddam Hussein a bloody nose but to go for his throat.'
But several Labour MPs exempted themselves from the front bench consensus on
last night's action. Mr Andrew Faulds (Warley East) said: 'This sort of
action simply ensures the survival of Saddam Hussein and makes millions of
converts to Islamic fundamentialism.'
Mr Rifkind provoked protests from some Labour MPs when he said one critic,
Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, 'might see himself as a friend
and ally' of Saddam - a charge Mr Cryer denied
The family of Mr Michael Wainwright, the Briton jailed for 10 years in
August last year for illegally entering Iraq, fear he could be used as a
human shield to prevent further allied strikes on military targets, PA adds.
His sister, Susan Priestley, of Halifax, said: 'We are worried about what
could happen to both Michael and the other jailed Briton, Paul Ride.
'They are currently being held in Baghdad but that could change.'
Mr Ride, of Walthamstow, east London, is serving a seven-year term for the
same offence.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Allies go for Saddam's rebuilt air defences
 -Baghdad has repaired its military infrastructure but is not ready for a
large-scale conflict
</HEADLINE>

THE allied air attack on southern Iraq yesterday comes as Baghdad was
showing unmistakable signs of renewed military confidence. There have been
intensive efforts to repair the damage done to the country's armed forces
and defensive infrastructure by the US-led coalition two years ago.
Western experts say lack of access to spares and new equipment has precluded
a recovery of military firepower, in sharp contrast to the build-up of new
Russian and other weapons in neighbouring Iran.
However, President Saddam Hussein is thought to have given high priority to
rebuilding Iraq's shattered network of air defences.
Even at the expense of sustaining further damage, Mr Saddam would relish the
propaganda benefit both internally and in the Arab world if his forces
succeeded in shooting down attacking US, British or French aircraft.
Experts do not believe he is contemplating a large-scale military
engagement. In spite of rhetoric from Baghdad suggesting renewed ambitions
over Kuwait, there has been no evidence of force movements to suggest any
such drastic step.
Mr David Bolton, director of the London-based Royal United Services
Institute for Defence Studies, said that in the run-up to yesterday's raids
President Saddam appeared to be aiming at gaining support among other
Islamic states by provoking the US and its allies into making an attack on
questionable authority.
Alternatively, if the coalition forces had decided against an attack, his
calculation was that he could influence neighbouring countries by a show of
political strength.
Either way, Mr Bolton said, President Saddam's tactic was above all an
attempt to undermine the sanctions regime and avert further economic
decline, which could threaten his own survival.
Iraq has been unable to replace the heavy equipment destroyed by allied
bombing in early 1991 or captured at the end of the war. These included some
3,000 tanks, more than 1,800 armoured vehicles and more than 2,100 artillery
pieces. Under the ceasefire terms, it had to submit lists of stocks and
equipment relating to its chemical, biological and nuclear weapon programmes
as well as ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 90 miles.
All these have been in the process of destruction. But Iraq is suspected by
western intelligence of hiding Scud-B missiles from the inspectors. It
initially declared holdings of 52 missiles - all but one being longer-range
Al-Hussein variants of the Scud - and subsequently admitted to a further 92.
Iraq bought more than 800 Scuds from the Soviet Union during its 1980-88 war
with Iran. It is uncertain how many it had left after that war and the 1991
Scud attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, especially since a number were
cannibalised to build the extended-range versions.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely President Saddam would resort to
using Scuds. That would instantly betray a breach of UN terms and reinforce
the legitimacy of any attack on him.
Iraqi armed forces have been regrouped. The military leadership has been
reshuffled and the army streamlined into about 30 armoured, mechanised and
infantry divisions, compared with more than 50 at the time of the 1990-91
Gulf crisis.
The country is still reckoned to have some 2,000 battle tanks and 2,000
artillery weapons, including Brazilian-made rocket launchers. Up to half of
Iraqi land forces are currently believed to be deployed in the north of the
country.
In air strength it clearly remains extremely vulnerable.
More than 100 of its combat aircraft were destroyed on the ground in the
1991 war, 35 were lost in combat and 112 went to Iran and have not been
returned.
It is left with about 300-350 fixed-wing combat aircraft including some
capable fighters such as the Mirage F-1 and MiG-29 but mostly of older
vintage and in poor condition. They are no match for the western aircraft
deployed in Saudi Arabia, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the
Gulf and in south-eastern Turkey.
Iraq has, however, no lack of airfields to operate from. It has about 30-40
major air bases, has done a lot of work to repair bomb damage and has
started to rebuild hardened aircraft shelters targeted by allied precision
bombers.
Military communications and other infrastructure have also been restored.
Stocks built up before the 1991 war are thought to have been used to rebuild
air defences.
Iraq has large numbers of anti-aircraft guns - some 5,500, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies - and the allies are
considered unlikely this time round to run the risk of low-level attacks.
The Iraqis also possess sizeable stocks of mostly Soviet-supplied air
defence missiles, although many of these are of 1960s vintage.
These include the batteries that recently provoked wrath at the UN when Iraq
deployed them in the no-fly zone patrolled by western aircraft south of the
32nd parallel.
