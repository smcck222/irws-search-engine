FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Attack may awaken Arab resentment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW Middle East governments have any sympathy for President Saddam Hussein,
but the resumption of allied air attacks on Iraq is likely to reawaken
smouldering Arab resentment against what is seen as a selective western
response to the enforcement of UN Security Council resolutions.
The fault lines that divided the Arab world during the Gulf war nearly two
years ago already show signs of re-emerging. Even before the attacks were
launched the lower house of the Jordanian parliament was voicing concern.
'The new provocations are a continuation of the injustice inflicted on the
Iraqi people since the start of the 1991 Gulf war,' said lower house
speaker, Mr Abdul-latif Arabiyat. We hope this abuse against Iraq and the
Arab nation will stop soon.'
The government was more cautious in its response. Officials said a
carefully-worded statement by Mr Kamel Abu Jaber, the foreign minister,
reflected a desire to avoid opening old wounds.
'We are still calling for the settlement of any dispute through dialogue and
negotiations, not through resorting to force to solve conflicts,' he was
quoted by state-run television as saying.
King Hussein's efforts to persuade the US and its allies not to launch an
all-out attack on Iraq two years ago cost him temporarily the respect he had
enjoyed in Washington and placed the monarch in the same camp as the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, Libya, Sudan and Yemen.
However the king's position accurately reflected the sentiments of many
Jordanians who revelled in Saddam Hussein's willingness to stand up to the
US and to fire missiles at Israel.
The Iraqi leader may not be able to count on quite such public sympathy on
this occasion.
But with more than 400 Palestinians suffering on a hillside in southern
Lebanon and Israel defying a UN resolution to take them back, the US-led
action against Iraq is bound to inflame radical opinion.
How strong and widespread that opinion is will in part depend on the extent
and severity of the allied attacks and whether there are civilian
casualties.
Egypt, which helped the US assemble the Gulf war coalition, said it
regretted the renewed use of force against Baghdad.
However, state television said President Hosni Mubarak also 'called on the
Iraqi regime to stop its policy of adventures which is damaging the people
of Iraq, their rights and their future.'
It said that Mr Mubarak told Egyptian newspaper editors with him on a visit
to Syria 'that he received the news of the attack on Iraqi military targets
with deep regret and that the situation should have escalated to the point
of using force.
'President Mubarak expressed his hope that the use of force would stop as
soon as possible, to preserve the people of Iraq, who have already suffered
much from the misery of war and destruction.'
The Egyptian leader's views will be shared elsewhere in the region, not
least in the Gulf itself, where hostility to Mr Saddam is tempered by deep
anxiety over Iraq being dismembered as a result of the two air exclusion
zones.
The US, Britain and France took many days last summer to persuade Saudi
Arabia of the necessity of sending allied aircraft back to the kingdom in
order to police the southern no-fly zone.
Bahrain, home for the British Tornado aircraft during the Gulf war, has
since made clear its desire not to cut all links with Baghdad, and remains
deeply troubled by the rash of border disputes which have broken out in the
region, particularly among the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council
 -Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar and Oman.
The six came together impressively following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
but there is likely to be less unanimity over whether the latest challenges
by Mr Saddam to the UN warrant a renewal of military action.
Only Kuwait appears to be unreservedly behind the US-led response. A senior
Kuwaiti official told Reuters he hoped that the allied military action
against Iraq would prevent any further 'miscalculations' by the Baghdad
regime.
'What I hope is that the Iraqi regime will avoid their continued
miscalculations,' Mr Suleiman Majed al-Shahin, the Kuwaiti foreign ministry
under-secretary, said in a telephone interview.
'As a small country, that is what we are hoping for.'
Lurking just beneath the surface in many Arab countries is the impact
renewed western intervention will have on populations where Islamic
fundamentalists appear to be gaining strength.
Egypt, where the tourist industry has been damaged this winter by extremist
terrorism, has launched large-scale police actions to root out the
dissidents which it says are being supported by Iran.
Elsewhere, such as in Algeria and in the Arab territories occupied by
Israel, there is some evidence that fundamentalist factions are gaining
ground. For them, just as for Iran after the overthrow of the Shah, the US
is seen as a vital element in maintaining the regimes against which they are
struggling.

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS delegates greeted news of the air strike almost with a sense
of relief that the allies had finally taken action to call President Saddam
Hussein to account for his persistent defiance of Security Council
resolutions.
At the same time, several third world members voiced the hope that the
operation would be brief and confined exclusively to strikes against
military targets.
The US formally notified the president of the Security Council, Mr Yoshio
Hatano of Japan, that the allies had resumed hostilities.
There was no immediate response from the president's office. Mr Hatano had
said earlier that he was willing to engage in 'a dialogue' with Iraq, as was
proposed late on Tuesday by Mr Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi ambassador.
Yesterday Mr Hamdoon said his country was halting the removal of materiel at
the Umm Qasr naval base which lies partly in Kuwait, but it was unclear
whether that decision preceded the allied military action.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, was in Paris yesterday where
he discussed the Iraqi crisis, among other issues, with Mr Lawrence
Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, who is also visiting the French
capital.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Moi's new cabinet fails to inspire foreign confidence

<TEXT>
KENYAN president Daniel arap Moi yesterday announced a new cabinet which is
unlikely to inspire domestic or foreign confidence in his adminstration.
Initial reactions from western donors, who are hoping for positive signals
from the government on economic reforms and clean government before resuming
about Dollars 400m (Pounds 261m) of suspended aid, were negative.
The president, who has struggled to put together a competent cabinet since
his narrow victory in marred multi-party elections last month, yesterday
formed a government which rewarded the tribes and personalities which gave
him support at the polls.
Kenya's two most dominant tribes, the Luo and the Kikuyu, were largely
excluded from cabinet posts after voting against Mr Moi and the ruling party
Kanu in the elections which saw 15 ministers defeated.
Mr Moi retained some of the defeated ministers by using his power to
nominate 12 members of parliament.
Western donors who were hoping Mr Moi would use his post-electoral
opportunity to sweep out discredited politicians and battle corruption and
economic mismanagement were disappointed.
'It's a hard-line Kanu government without any sign of being able to build
consensus,' said one senior western economist. 'We can't expect better
economic policy from this bunch. Moi's wasted a golden opportunity.'
Professor George Saitoti remains Vice President but Mr Moi removed him from
the finance post replacing it with planning and national development. Mr
Musalia Mudavadi, a 32 year-old politician from western Kenya, becomes the
new finance minister.
'This means Moi and Saitoti unfortunately keep control of economic policy,'
said the economist.
In the new trimmed cabinet of 25 ministers nine former ministers were
reappointed. Two of the nine, who were trounced in last month's elections,
retained cabinet posts after Mr Moi nominated them to parliament. They are
Mr Joseph Kamotho, education minister, and the only Kikuyu in the cabinet
and Mr Dalmas Otieno, transport minister, the only Luo minister.
The new cabinet shows a continuation of Mr Moi's policy of ethnic balancing
but it has a heavy bias towards the president's Rift valley province, home
to his Kalenjin tribe and other minority pastoral tribes such as the Masai.
Also rewarded strongly are the Kamba tribe from eastern province, the Luhya
from western province, and the Kisii from Nyanza province .

<TEXT>
ELEVEN people were killed in an eighth day of Hindu-Moslem clashes in Bombay
yesterday, and hospitals reported at least 500 had died in week-long rioting
in India's commercial capital, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Security forces relaxed curfews imposed on riot-hit areas for six hours and
Bombay police chief Shreekant Bapat said the level of violence was
substantially lower than over the past few days.
'There is a very substantial improvement in the overall situation. This is
reflected by more and more people and buses on the roads.'
Defence minister Sharad Pawar ruled out imposing a state of emergency in the
city of 12m people, which had been suggested by business leaders and editors
who saw in the riots a concerted attempt to drive out Moslems.
He told a press conference that the city was returning to normality after a
week of frenzied riots in which hundreds of people have been stabbed, and
countless homes, cars and shops set ablaze.
Mr Pawar said it would take another two or three days to restore order
completely.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday decided to open up the country's most
sensitive political issue, the future of its post-war peace constitution, by
approving plans for a bi-partisan commission to review it.
The decision is likely to spark a vigorous debate over the merits of the key
Article Nine in the 1947 constitution which renounces war, as well as the
threat of, or use of, force to settle international disputes.
The debate will crystallise positions within Japan on how it should develop
a wider international role in the wake of the end of the cold war.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
policy affairs council, who proposed the commission, said revisions to the
constitution would be necessary if Japan was to respond to its allies' calls
for it to play a larger role in peace-keeping operations undertaken by the
United Nations.
Mr Mitsuzuka is backed by several other LDP leaders including Mr Michio
Watanabe, the foreign minister, Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the party's powerful
general secretary, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the young former general secretary
who recently founded his own faction.
The Socialist party, which has traditionally opposed revision of Article
Nine, has recently indicated it is prepared to reconsider the issue.
However, older LDP leaders, led by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
are opposed to tampering with the constitution. Significantly, the decision
to set up the commission was taken in Mr Miyazawa's absence on a tour of
South-East Asia.
The debate will be as tortuous as it is heated.
The government last year passed a bill, only after two years of wrangling,
which would allow Japanese troops to be sent abroad.
Any revision to the constitution would it in itself mark an important step
for Japan towards a more independent foreign policy.
The constitution has never been amended since it was introduced by the US
occupying force after the Second World War.
Amendment would require the support of two-thirds of both houses of the
Japanese parliament.

THE OPPOSITION Iraqi National Congress (INC), made up of liberal Arabs and

writes Gareth Smyth in London.
'Any military strike that weakens Saddam Hussein will be welcomed by the
Iraqi people,' said spokesman Ahmed Chalabi. 'The noose must be tightened
around him.'
An INC statement issued in London called for the creation of a UN-guaranteed
security zone in south Iraq; for the immediate convocation of a tribunal to
try Mr Saddam for crimes against humanity; and for the United Nations to
take over direct responsibility for all humanitarian assistance from Mr
Saddam's regime.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Japan's rulers set to boost economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday began clearing the way for
an additional stimulus to the ailing economy.
The party agreed to set up a task force to consider plans to revive an
economy only being saved from outright recession by expansionary public
spending.
The task force, the LDP's response to mounting business pressure for tax
cuts, is expected to propose new measures to be implemented after the 1993
budget is approved in early April.
The group is to be headed by Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's
policy research council, who recently made outspoken attacks on official
complacency over the state of the economy.
The group will provide a powerful counterweight to the influence of the
finance ministry which is opposed to higher government spending to finance
tax cuts, and the Bank of Japan, which insists another interest rate cut
must follow in the wake of a further fiscal stimulus.
The task force will focus on plans for a supplementary budget to augment the
Y72,400 (Pounds 383bn) draft budget which will provide only a 0.2 per cent
rise in general public spending.
Top business organisations are pressing for a tax cut package to revive
consumption and investment. Japan's international trading partners are
likely to call on it to stimulate domestic demand to cut its ballooning
trade surplus.
Demands for tax cuts will intensify with the traditional spring wage
negotiations in which employers will insist on a low increase.
The Japan Federation of Employers' Associations has urged its members to
award no more than 2.3 per cent rises, in guidelines for bargaining agreed
this week.
Rengo, the largest trade union federation, has called for a 7 per cent rise.
Low wage rises will dampen consumption which ended the year badly depressed,
figures published yesterday show. Tokyo department store sales in December
were 11.2 per cent down on the year before, the largest ever annual fall.
Sales in Tokyo department stores, for the past year as a whole, were 5.7 per
cent down on 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY, a robust member of the anti-Baghdad coalition in the retaking of
Kuwait in 1991, has shown little enthusiasm for the renewed allied military
action against President Saddam Hussein in the run-up to yesterday's action.
It is concerned at possible Kurdish gains in the north of the country, where
Kurds have established a de facto government under the umbrella of allied
air deterrence.
Ahead of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's planned visit to Syria and the
Gulf states next week, where Turkey is forging closer ties, officials have
been reluctant to express reservations over US action.
However, at the public level there is growing bitterness over the west's and
particularly the US's foreign policy priorities at a time when it is sending
troops to Somalia, threatening Baghdad with renewed air strikes yet ignoring
Serbian atrocities against Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
One newspaper even suggested the recent US relief mission was to secure
Somalia's oil rights.
'The same treatment should be given to Saddam Hussein in Iraq and to
Milosevic in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' one commentator wrote in Sabah, the
largest Turkish newspaper. Zaman, the Islamic daily, criticised the US for
banning Iraq from 'taking military measures on its own soil. This is a
violation of Iraq's sovereignty rights'.
As long as the danger was confined to the south of Iraq, Turkey voiced
diplomatic concern at Iraqi violations of UN ceasefire and other
resolutions. But Turkey has suffered economically from Iraq's political and
economic isolation, and has long argued that Baghdad should comply as a
first step to being accepted back by the international community.
However, the news that anti-aircraft missiles have also been deployed inside
the no-fly zone established above the 36th parallel in the north means
Turkey may come under pressure to provide bases for US and allied aircraft.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Japan and EC seek to monitor trade: Meetings to discuss
working group to look into Dollars 29bn surplus

<TEXT>
JAPANESE ministers and EC commissioners will try to reach agreement tomorrow
on how to monitor bilateral trade between the EC and Japan - a move the
Commission believes could indirectly help reduce Japan's growing trade
surplus with the Community.
Commissioners begin informal meetings with five Japanese ministers today in
Brussels, in preparation for tomorrow's formal discussions on political and
economic relations between the EC and Japan.
The Japanese group is headed by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister
and foreign minister, and Mr Yashiro Mori from the Ministry for
International Trade and Industry (Miti).
Officials in Brussels said yesterday that setting up a working group to
monitor Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC would allow the Community
and Japan to spot if structural barriers were keeping EC producers and
products out of the Japanese market.
Figures for January to November 1992 show a surplus of Dollars 29.2bn
(Pounds 19.2bn) on trade with the EC - 17.2 per cent up on the equivalent
period.
A working group was first proposed by the EC last May, as part of an effort
to develop the 1991 EC-Japan declaration on political and economic
co-operation. Attempts to improve monitoring have been thwarted since then
by disputes about the proper statistics to use. But Japanese officials said
yesterday they thought agreement would be reached on the establishment of
such a group, although it might prove more difficult to fix the experts'
'terms of reference'.
The Commission is also expected to urge Japan to avoid signing bilateral
agreements which might discriminate against other trading partners, such as
Japan's free-trade pact with the US on semiconductors.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Moi's new cabinet fails to inspire foreign confidence

KENYAN president Daniel arap Moi yesterday announced a new cabinet which is
unlikely to inspire domestic or foreign confidence in his adminstration.
Initial reactions were negative from western donors, who were hoping for
positive signals on economic reforms and clean government before resuming
about Dollars 400m (Pounds 261m) of suspended aid.
The president, who has struggled to put together a competent cabinet since
his narrow victory in marred multi-party elections last month, has formed a
government which rewarded the tribes and personalities which supported him
at the polls.
Kenya's two most dominant tribes, the Luo and the Kikuyu, have been largely
excluded after voting against Mr Moi and the ruling Kanu party.
Mr Moi has retained some of the 15 defeated ministers by using his power to
nominate 12 members of parliament.
Western donors expressed disappointment. 'It's a hard-line Kanu government
without any sign of being able to build consensus,' said one senior western
economist. 'We can't expect better economic policy from this bunch. Moi's
wasted a golden opportunity.'
Professor George Saitoti remains vice president but Mr Moi removed him from
the finance post replacing it with planning and national development. Mr
Musalia Mudavadi, a 32-year-old politician from western Kenya, becomes the
finance minister. 'This means Moi and Saitoti unfortunately keep control of
economic policy,' said the economist.
In the new trimmed cabinet of 25 nine former ministers have been
reappointed. Two of them, trounced in the elections, retained cabinet posts
after Mr Moi nominated them to parliament. They are Mr Joseph Kamotho,
education minister, and the only Kikuyu in the cabinet, and Mr Dalmas
Otieno, transport minister, the only Luo.
The cabinet shows a continuation of Mr Moi's policy of ethnic balancing but
it has a heavy bias towards his Rift Valley province, home to his Kalenjin
tribe and other minority pastoral tribes such as the Masai. Also rewarded
strongly are the Kamba tribe from eastern province, the Luhya from western
province, and the Kisii from Nyanza province.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Deals in E Europe tending to be bigger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN multinationals are increasing the scale of their involvement in
eastern Europe, with increasing numbers of 'mega-deals' worth hundreds of
millions of dollars, writes Frances Williams.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe* has identified 14 joint
ventures since early 1991 in which western multi-nationals plan to invest a
total of Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds 6.7bn); six of the biggest acquisitions will
cost western companies more than Dollars 2.1bn in all.
The true value of large-scale deals by foreign companies may be much higher,
the ECE says, since the figures are often not divulged.
The favoured recipient of these 'mega-deals' has been the then Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic, followed by Hungary, Poland and Russia.
The ECE also notes that while the prominent role of German investors in the
region has sometimes come in for criticism, the groups involved in the
biggest projects are often American.
US companies - Conoco, Philip Morris, International Paper Company, Kay
Universal, General Electric and K-Mart - were responsible for six of the top
10 acquis-itions in central and eastern Europe.
The biggest western investor in eastern Europe appears to be Conoco, which
is paying Dollars 1bn for a Polish acquisition and plans to invest Dollars
4bn in a Russian joint venture. Most large-scale projects are concentrated
in the car, oil and petrochemicals industries, the ECE says.
In general, however, foreign investment projects in eastern Europe are
undertaken by small and medium-sized companies on a relatively small scale.
By October 1992 the ECE had recorded 52,700 projects involving foreign
capital of Dollars 12.4bn.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Morocco sets sights on EC: Hassan seeks to tie country to
rich north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KING Hassan of Morocco's intention, declared five and a half years ago, of
applying for his country to join the European Community was greeted among
many officials in Brussels with a mixture of incredulity and scorn. On
Christmas eve the EC Council of Ministers gave senior officials permission
to negotiate with Morocco a treaty of partnership modelled on those with
central Europe.
But unlike the agreements with Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia
which may lead to eventual membership, any accord with Morocco will only
lead to a closer, but as yet undefined, partnership.
The disarray in the Maghreb Arab Union - Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco
and Tunisia - is the key factor behind this change. The EC would have
preferred to develop relations with all five members, but Libya is in
international quarantine, while the deep crisis in Algeria does not allow
for any new policy initiatives.
Morocco conducts more than half its foreign trade with EC countries and is
attracting an ever-increasing flow of foreign investment, notably from Spain
and France. Its senior officials say they are prepared to bring down tariffs
on industrial products but the quid pro quo would be free access for
Moroccan fruit and vegetables, notably citrus fruit. Morocco's comparative
advantage, the high quality of what it produces and the labour-intensive
nature of such activity, which provides jobs for Moroccans at home and helps
curtail emmigration, all plead in favour of a bold European move.
King Hassan's strategic aim is to try to tie his country to a rich and
stable north rather than a fragmented Maghreb. Such links will be
complemented by a pipeline planned to carry Algerian gas to Spain via
Morocco.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Dunkel puts off top-level Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, has postponed until next Tuesday a meeting of senior trade
negotiators in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks. The top level
Trade Negotiations Committee had been planned for Friday.
The aim is to give US and European Community negotiators more time to edge
forward on a tariff deal, which could then pave the way for early completion
of the six-year-old Round. Trade officials want to present the Clinton
administration, which takes office on Wednesday, with as much of the Round
sewn up as possible.
However, it is now inevitable that a large amount of unfinished business
will be bequeathed to the inexperienced Clinton trade team, and negotiators
are not optimistic that the Round can be concluded in time to catch the
March 2 expiry of the US administration's current negotiating authority.
US and EC officials said yesterday they would continue to work for a tariff
agreement over the next few days, but both sides have said the other is not
being sufficiently forthcoming. Mrs Carla Hills, President Bush's trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, spoke on
the telephone on Tuesday after negotiations in Geneva reached an impasse,
but officials yesterday were downbeat about the prospects for a deal.
The main stumbling-block remains textiles where the EC is demanding a 50 per
cent cut in the highest US tariffs but is refusing US demands for a similar
percentage cut in the Community's own lower tariffs.
Washington, which wants industrialised countries to scrap tariffs in a wide
range of sectors, says Brussels is not offering enough on wood, aluminium,
medical, scientific and agricultural equipment and electronic items such as
semiconductors and photocopiers.
The Uruguay Round target is for overall tariff cuts of a third, but the US
wants to do this through a series of sectoral deals while the EC prefers
lowering tariffs across the board with bigger cuts for high tariffs.
The two sides expect to meet again today when Mr Dunkel will also resume
talks with a core group of about 20 countries to take stock of other
outstanding issues in the Round. Most of these concern the US, but India is
challenging the terms of the draft textiles accord and Japan and South Korea
object to opening their closed rice markets.

<TEXT>
THE prospect of a rupture between Greece and her European Community partners
over Macedonia drew closer yesterday after the Danish presidency of the EC
called for the United Nations to resolve the status of the former Yugoslav
republic.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said he believed the UN
Security Council could reach a solution as early as next week, in which case
Denmark was ready to recognise Macedonia.
'We have a black spot on our conscience,' Mr Ellemann-Jensen said in
Copenhagen. 'We have reached the point where we cannot keep the lid on this
(in the EC).
'We have to look to the UN for a solution.'
Greece has held up EC recognition of Yugoslavia for almost a year on the
grounds that it undermines the status of the northern Greek province of
Macedonia. Athens argues that the republic should choose a different name to
avoid implying a territorial claim on Greek Macedonia.
A Community decision to hand the issue over to the UN - thus allowing
individual states to open diplomatic relations - would be viewed in Athens
as a breach of EC solidarity.
The Greek government reacted angrily yesterday to Mr Ellemann-Jensen's
proposal. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Danish foreign minister
'should respect Community policy as defined at two EC summits on the
preconditions for recognition'.
Athens is also trying to delay UN recognition for Macedonia by arguing that
the Security Council should be briefed on the Greek position before
considering the republic's request for membership, which was formally
submitted last week.
The Danish foreign minister raised questions about Greece's support for UN
economic sanctions against Serbia. An EC Commission report last year accused
Greek companies of systematic sanctions busting.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen also accused Athens of blocking an EC plan agreed at last
month's summit in Edinburgh to send Ecu50m (Pounds 40.5m) of humanitarian
aid to Macedonia.
However, after a meeting of EC foreign minister in Paris late last night he
said his Greek counterpart had promised to help EC aid reach the former
Yugoslav republic.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S two main right-wing opposition parties yesterday settled two
months' tough negotiations by agreeing to field joint candidates in 460 of
the 577 constituencies represented in the National Assembly in next month's
parliamentary elections, writes William Dawkins from Paris.
Of the remaining 117 constituencies, the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF
will send rival parliamentary candidates to contest 84 seats, Mr Alain
Juppe, RPR secretary-general, said. They have not yet decided how to
organise their forces in the remaining 33 constituencies.
Initially, the right had hoped to limit to 50 the number of constituencies
in which the UDF and RPR would fight each other, but internal rivalries
pushed that number higher. 'There will be a single candidate in 85 per cent
of constituencies and organised duels in 15 per cent,' said Mr Juppe,
calling the accord a success.
Recent polls suggest the right would win a landslide 400 seats in the
assembly. The election will have two rounds of single-candidate majority
voting on March 21 and 28.

</HEADLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called
for closer economic co-operation among EC member states, warning that recent
turbulence in the European monetary system risked a relapse into the
competitive devaluations of the late 1970s.
Without closer co-operation, the EC's plans for economic and monetary union
by the end of the decade were in jeopardy, Mr Delors said after talks in
Copenhagen between the Commission and the newly installed Danish presidency
of the EC. He called for frank exchanges between EC economic and finance
ministers - suggesting that the current status quo was unsatisfactory.
Mr Delors - occasionally viewed as a bit of a Napoleon figure in Denmark -
was positively restrained yesterday. Asked whether he intended to help
persuade Danish voters to approve the Maastricht treaty in a second
referendum in the late spring, Mr Delors replied with a smile: 'The less
interference the better.' Instead he launched an appeal for the growth
package agreed at Edinburgh last month, calling it a crucial test of
co-operation among member states.
This week the Commission agreed plans to create a new European Investment
Fund and to expand the borrowing powers of the European Investment Bank to
fund road, telecommunications and other infrastructure projects. EC
officials are also looking to member states to maximise the impact of the
growth initiative through closer co-ordination, particularly on shifting
from current to capital spending. Mr Delors set a target date of
mid-February for agreement.
Mr Poul Schluter, Danish prime minister, identified the main priorities in
his country's six-month presidency as the start of enlargement talks with
Sweden, Austria, Finland, and hopefully Norway next month; the introduction
of more transparency in EC affairs; and more subsidiarity - devolving
decision-making to the lowest appropriate level.
The Danes also plan to hold a special conference, in Copenhagen on April 13
and 14, with central and eastern European countries, including Poland, the
Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Albania, Romania and Bulgaria, and the
Baltic republics. The aim is to strengthen economic and political ties with
these new democracies. Danish officials had earlier said the conference
would be attended by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, but this was a clerical
error.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ruling coalition agreed yesterday on a formula to change the
constitution and enable German soldiers to take part in United Nations
peace-keeping and peace-making operations.
The plan, which would also provide for such operations outside the UN
umbrella, now has to win the support of the opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD) to gain a two-thirds majority in parliament, if it is to become
a constitutional amendment. It is planned to submit it to the Bundestag for
a first reading tomorrow.
The sudden agreement, after months of negotiations between the coalition
partners, follows the forthright call by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali on Monday
for Germany to play a full part in future UN operations.
The immediate urgency is that without such a deal, German air force
personnel would be taken off Nato Awacs reconnaissance aircraft monitoring
violations of the no-fly-zone over the former Yugoslavia, if the UN Security
Council decided to enforce the zone. Without German personnel, the aircraft
would be restricted in their operations.
Although the immediate reaction of the SPD to the plan was hostile, it will
place the opposition in an embarrassing position of being seen to block a
reasonable compromise if it votes against it.
The constitutional 'amplification' proposed by the coalition, would add
three paragraphs, distinguishing between UN peace-keeping operations, UN
peace-making operations, and 'exercising the right of collective
self-defence in terms of Article 51 of the UN charter'. German military
forces would be enabled to take part in UN peace-keeping measures in
accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, or as defined by the UN
charter. They would also be able to take part in peace-making measures,
provided they have been agreed by a Security Council resolution.
Both those measures would be subject merely to a majority vote in the
Bundestag.
The most controversial proposal, however, is the third paragraph, which
would allow 'collective self-defence' operations outside the UN framework,
provided they are carried out with other countries in the framework of
'alliances and other regional agreements' to which Germany belongs.
The importance of the clause is that it would allow Germany to operate
outside the Nato area with its alliance partners, or in the context of the
Western European Union or a future European defence corps, without a full UN
resolution.

FT  14 JAN 93 / EBRD may help Russia with 'rouble funds'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is drawing up plans for
one or more 'rouble funds' to help modernise Russia's agriculture and to
restructure its military industries.
Mr Ronald Freeman, the bank's first vice-president responsible for
investment banking, said bank staff were working on the project intensively
and hoped to present it to the EBRD board for approval before the middle of
this year. If approved, the plan could be operating by the end of this year.
According to Mr Freeman, there will probably be separate rouble funds to
harness western investment capital and Russian domestic savings for
agriculture investment and military conversion. They will be similar in
concept to sector funds in the US. The EBRD will identify promising projects
in the privatised Russian industrial and farm sectors.
It will invite western investors, such as pension funds, to subscribe hard
currency equity capital to the funds to finance the western imports needed
for the projects. At the same time, Russian investors will be offered
holdings in the funds that would be subscribed in roubles.
The idea is that western investors could look forward to a potentially large
return on their investments if the projects prosper, while the equity nature
of the funds would also offer Russian investors a chance to protect their
rouble savings from inflation. The EBRD itself would take a significant
initial stake of perhaps a quarter to a third of the funds, but would expect
this share to fall as the investments become established.
Mr Freeman cautiously estimated the funds could total between some tens of
millions of dollars to Dollars 100m (Pounds 65.7m).
The EBRD, which was set up two years ago by western and former communist
states to help the former communist states develop market based economies,
has drawn up its plans following a request from President Boris Yeltsin for
the bank to become more involved in modernising Russian agriculture and in
the conversion of military industries to peaceful ends. News of the
initiative came to light in the making of a television programme about the
EBRD, called Capitalism goes East, which will be broadcast in Britain on
Channel Four next Sunday.
Private sector companies have set up similar funds in developing countries
and former communist states. But Russia presents some difficult problems.
The biggest immediate problem will be to find an appropriate exchange rate
for converting the western capital to roubles.
In spite of hyper-inflation in Russia, the bank believes that the rouble is
badly undervalued against the dollar and other western currencies.
It will have to persuade western investors to share this view.
The availability of suitable projects will also depend on how quickly
privatisation proceeds in Russia, although here Mr Freeman and his
colleagues are encouraged by the support being given to the idea of
privately owned business by Russia's politicians. Although Russia proposed
the funds as a way of bringing together western capital and domestic
savings, legal and valuation problems also have to be overcome.
At the present rouble-dollar exchange rate, Kirovsky Zavod, a huge
industrial complex in the port area of St Petersburg, employing 30,000
people, has a book value of just Dollars 800,000.
Mr Freeman believes that the EBRD will be able to reach fair solutions that
will win EBRD board approval and appeal to investors and the potential
recipients of the capital in Russia. He has already sounded out equity
investing institutions in the US, Canada, France and London about the idea.
They have indicated interest in committing what he calls 'brave money' to
the funds.

leader ended 169 days in prison after a constitutional court ruled he was
too ill to stand trial, Leslie Colitt writes from Berlin. Mr Honecker has
liver cancer and is not expected to live long. The court ruling said his
detention was senseless as he would not survive until the end of the trial.
He was charged with manslaughter over the fatal border shooting of 13 East
Germans trying to escape to the west. Outside Moabit prison, a knot of
supporters cheered the man they regard as an anti-Nazi hero.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Chernomyrdin agrees to roll back price controls in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has agreed to roll back
controversial price controls. The economics ministry said yesterday it was
working on 'significantly' shortening the list of goods affected by
restrictions on enterprises' profit margins, writes Leyla Boulton.
The announcement follows moves by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime
minister for economics and finance, to convince Mr Chernomyrdin that the
decision sent the wrong signals politically about the government's
determination to pursue market reforms.
Mr Fyodorov, who was brought into the government to handle macroeconomic
policy and to reassure domestic and foreign opinion that Russia remained
committed to radical reforms, announced earlier this week he was retaining
Prof Jeffrey Sachs and other western economists as advisers.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Row with Ukraine hits debt rescheduling talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has called off debt rescheduling talks with its western creditors,
after failing to resolve its dispute with Ukraine over how to divide up the
assets of the former Soviet Union.
Ukraine signed a protocol in November agreeing to relinquish its claim on
most Soviet assets in exchange for Russia assuming responsibility for
Ukraine's share of the estimated Dollars 67bn (Pounds 44bn) Soviet debt -
the last of the former Soviet republics to accept this arrangement.
The agreement has since broken down, however, and now seems likely to delay
a settlement with creditor nations, grouped in the Paris Club, by at least
several weeks. Russia and Ukraine are due to begin talks in Moscow today and
tomorrow on the deadlock with Ukraine.
Hopes have been raised that President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine could resolve the dispute at their meeting
tomorrow, but Russian officials have warned their western counterparts not
to count on this.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for the
negotiations, yesterday said he still believed a rescheduling agreement
could be reached by the end of the month. But he said that Russia would find
it difficult to pay more than Dollars 3bn on servicing the debt of the
former Soviet Union without cutting back on oil deliveries to other former
Soviet republics in order to raise more hard currency revenues.
Previously Russia had appeared to move closer to its creditors' demands,
agreeing last month to pay Dollars 4bn.
'We cannot exclude that the search for a mutually acceptable solution may
require further high level meetings,' Russia said in a letter to western
debt negotiators.
Mr Olin Wethington, who has been in charge of the Russian debt negotiations
at the US Treasury, called the breakdown 'puzzling and unfortunate,' and
warned that the build-up of payment arrears was making it more and more
difficult to reach a satisfactory solution to Russia's debt problems.
A Paris Club rescheduling of government to government debts would open the
way for a parallel agreement with the London club, representing around 600
commercial bank creditors, on more than Dollars 20bn of commercial debts.
Because of the assets dispute with Ukraine, Russia has not yet formally
responded to an offer made last month by the Group of Seven industrial
nations to reschedule over Dollars 15bn of past official debt, cutting
Russia's debt service obligations this year from Dollars 12bn to Dollars
2.75bn.
But Russia is now accumulating arrears on debts it has contracted more
recently, and a large proportion of these will have to be paid up before a
rescheduling deal can go ahead.

FT  14 JAN 93 / W German growth rate falls to 0.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST Germany's growth rate is continuing to fall rapidly after hitting a
10-year low in 1992, according to the Bonn economics ministry.
Figures released yesterday by the federal statistics offices showed gross
national product rose only 0.8 per cent last year, after a 3.6 per cent
increase in 1991. This was the worst result since 1982, when the economy
shrank by more than 1 per cent.
A senior finance ministry official said negative growth this year could no
longer be ruled out, while the economics ministry said the faster slowdown
in the final quarter of 1992 would be a 'burden' on future prospects.
Despite forecasts of up to 1 per cent contraction this year, the government
remains confident the economy does not face a period of extended recession.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the finance ministry, said yesterday he
did not expect a 'cumulative decline.' Conditions for recovery were good, he
claimed: the banks were strong, and in contrast to other industrial
economies, savings and investment were high and the infrastructure was
intact, he told a financiers' meeting.
Mr Wolfgang Strohm, a senior government statistician, said the economy
probably contracted 'modestly' in the last quarter of 1992. Full details
will not be available until March.
However, further evidence emerged yesterday from two of Germany's strongest
regional economies to show that industrial conditions are worsening
dramatically. Manufacturing output in Bavaria during November was 7.8 per
cent down on the same month in 1991, while production in Hesse fell 5.9 per
cent.
The first figures combining western and eastern growth statistics since
unification in 1990 showed pan-German GNP rose 1.3 per cent last year. Gross
domestic product, which excludes overseas earnings, increased 1.9 per cent
to a total value of DM3,004bn (Pounds 1,236bn) of which the lame-duck
eastern economy contributed just DM232bn.
GDP in the west rose 1.5 per cent and 6.1 per cent in the east. But as the
economics ministry pointed out, there is still no sign of a self-sustaining
recovery in the former GDR, home to 20 per cent of the German population.
Although average wages there now stand at 63 per cent of western rates,
productivity is less than 40 per cent of levels in the west.
East German engineering and metal workers were yesterday offered a 9 per
cent pay increase for this year in the first round of talks aimed at slowing
wage escalation.
Employers claimed they could no longer afford a previously agreed 26 per
cent rise, and want to renegotiate a deal under which eastern workers have
been promised pay parity with their western counterparts by 1994.

FT  14 JAN 93 / British Steel plans price increases to stabilise market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL plans to raise prices on some of its main products by as much
as 13 per cent in a bold attempt to halt the fall in prices that has sent
the European steel industry into one of its deepest ever recessions.
The privatised UK steelmaker says it will raise prices on plates and
sections by 4-7 per cent on March 1, while strip mill products will be
raised by 11-13 per cent.
The price rises are likely to be followed soon by other big European steel
producers, according to observers. British Steel warned that the scale of
price reductions over the past few months would necessitate further
increases later in the year.
European steel prices have fallen by 30 per cent or more since 1989, and
producers say current levels are not sustainable if the industry is to fund
investment without making catastrophic cuts in capacity. Almost all the big
European producers are losing money: British Steel lost Pounds 51m pre-tax
in the half-year ended October 3.
Yesterday's announcement comes almost exactly a year after British Steel
said it would raise prices of its flat-rolled products by between 3 per cent
and 4 per cent from April last year. But the increases failed to stick for
long because of overproduction by the big European steel producers.
However, in November and December almost all west European producers cut
their crude steel output sharply. Mr Peter Fish, managing director of MEPS
(Europe), the Sheffield-based steel consultancy, said: 'If the producers can
follow up with more production cuts in the first quarter, I'm almost
convinced there will be a turn in prices for deliveries in the third quarter
of 1993.'
British Steel said the price rises announced yesterday would help offset
recent cost increases, including the effects of the sterling devaluation on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
Earlier this week, MEPS forecast that steel demand in Europe was likely to
decline further this year. It estimated that European Community crude steel
output would fall from an estimated 132.5m tonnes in 1992 to 130.5m tonnes.
The UK, it says, is the only leading producer country likely to increase
steel production in 1993, with output forecast to rise to 16.7m tonnes from
an estimated 16.1m tonnes last year.

FT  14 JAN 93 / World markets react calmly to air strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD financial markets reacted calmly to the allied attack on Iraq
yesterday, write our Economics and Foreign Staff.
Reports that President George Bush was planning an attack had pushed the
dollar to a high of DM1.6333 in European trading, from a previous close in
London at DM1.632.
White House confirmation of bombing raids lifted the dollar higher in the
US, to DM1.635, before profit-taking brought it back to DM1.6225. In Tokyo,
the dollar opened weaker at DM1.6185, although analysts said the US currency
should benefit from heightened tension, as it was seen as a 'safe haven'.
The Nikkei average was down slightly in early Tokyo trading on concern about
further conflict. US shares retreated on news of the attack, but later
recovered. Having fallen 20 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
down just 1.08 at 3,263.56. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares
closed down 12.6 at 2,745.3.
Oil prices were unchanged late yesterday after moving up about 30 cents a
barrel on the immediate news of the attack.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Saddam defiant as allies bomb Iraqi missile sites: More than
100 US, British and French aircraft take part in raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, PHILIP STEPHENS and Our foreign staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQI president Saddam Hussein remained defiant last night after US, British
and French combat aircraft launched their first strike against Iraq since
the Gulf War two years ago.
The three-hour raid, seemingly limited to attacks on surface-to-air missile
sites and command centres in the southern no-fly zone set up by the allies
last August, was launched from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk in the Gulf
and from air bases in Saudi Arabia. Washington described the raid as a
success, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said allied
aircraft had inflicted serious damage on Iraqi targets.
One Iraqi soldier and three civilians were killed in the attack, according
to Iraq's INA news agency. Three soldiers and four civilians were wounded.
In a bellicose response, Mr Saddam, in a televised speech to the nation,
vowed that Baghdad would confront any future raid and urged his depleted air
force to fight back. Iraqi forces met last night's raid only with a modest
amount of anti-aircraft fire, and all allied aircraft were said to have
returned safely.
The Iraqi leader said: 'Another battle has started. Another jihad (holy war)
ordained by God, so that we can attain another great victory for you, the
Iraqi people.'
His tone contradicted an earlier apparent climbdown at the United Nations,
where Iraq pledged to halt incursions into Kuwaiti territory and to
authorise UN flights into Iraq, two of the UN's main demands.
US president George Bush - who yesterday entered the last week of his
presidency - said he had no reservations about ordering the attack. 'A
coalition of strong allies has performed in superb fashion,' he said.
He underlined Washington's commitment to the sovereignty and security of
Kuwait by recommitting some ground forces to the country. Mr Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said a 'task force' - which according
to US army chiefs would number some 1,700 including support staff - was
being dispatched.
Mr Fitzwater noted that Baghdad had earlier renewed its intention to retake
Kuwait. An editorial in the Iraqi government newspaper al-Jumhouriyah
yesterday revived Iraq's claim of sovereignty over Kuwait, vowing that
'Kuwait shall return to Iraq in defiance of the Security Council and
America' and as an 'integral part of Iraq'.
The strike involved 80 strike aircraft and 30 support planes. It included
British Tornado strike aircraft, six of which are stationed at Dhahran in
north-eastern Saudi Arabia, with cover provided by six of France's Mirage
2000 fighters, also based there. 'Preliminary information indicates the
mission was accomplished,' said Mr Fitzwater. 'All of our planes have
returned to their bases.' He said the targets were 'several missile sites'
in the southern part of Iraq.
The US and its coalition partners stood ready to take 'additional actions'
to assure Iraqi compliance with ceasefire terms, he added.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, a spokesman for Mr Bill Clinton, said the
President-elect fully supported the air attack. He said Mr Clinton stood
'four-square with the president in his determination to ensure compliance
with all relevant UN resolutions'.
In London, Mr John Major warned that the 'limited and proportionate'
response to Iraq's violations of UN resolutions could be followed by further
military strikes.
At the UN in New York, ambassadors of the US, Britain, Russia and France -
the four permanent members of the Security Council - formally warned Iraq to
expect further action if it did not comply with the terms of the Gulf war
ceasefire.
Their warning was delivered to Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador at the
UN, who said after the raid, but before Mr Saddam's broadcast, that his
government would remove no more equipment from Baghdad's former naval base
at Umm Qasr, located in territory that has now been ruled by the UN to
belong to Kuwait. Nor would it block UN inspectors from flying their own
planes into Iraq.
Mr Yoshio Hatano, Japanese president of the Security Council, last night
told reporters that it appeared that Iraq had met the demands made
concerning border incursions and the transporting of UN weapons inspectors.
But he was waiting for a formal Iraqi letter to that effect.
These recent actions by Iraq, along with violations of the no-fly zone south
of the 32nd parallel established in August by the western allies,
threatening missile movements and attacks on UN relief operations in
Kurdistan, formed part of what the US and its partners saw as a pattern of
provocation by Iraq. In the past, similar conciliatory statements by Iraqi
envoys have also been undermined by defiant words from their president at
home.

FT  14 JAN 93 / Campaign to curb quangos fails to hold down costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S campaign to curb the power and influence of non-elected
quangos appears to have failed, according to a survey carried out by the
Financial Times.
The number of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations -
has fallen by more than a fifth since 1979, when Mrs Margaret Thatcher
became prime minister. But the amount of taxpayers' money they spend has
increased threefold, to Pounds 41.7bn, 20 per cent more than the rate of
inflation.
Unelected members of quango boards are now responsible for more than a fifth
of public expenditure, including key public services, such as health, higher
and further education and the legal aid system.
The FT survey found that the Conservatives have used their patronage powers
to appoint many more businessmen to run the largest quangos.
Nearly two-thirds of the chairmen of the top 40 quangos in 1990-91 were from
business and industry, compared with a third in 1978-79.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph has broadened its technology patents dispute
with MCI Communications by filing a patent infringement suit against the
rival telecommunications company, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The AT&amp;T suit follows MCI's earlier action seeking a court ruling that
certain AT&amp;T patents were not enforceable.
AT&amp;T said it had been negotiating with MCI since 1988, seeking a two per
cent royalty on some of the patents. These cover 800 (toll-free) service
enhancements, credit card processing and verification techniques, and
techniques for controlling toll-fraud abuse and branding several types of
telephone calls with an audible company slogan.
AT&amp;T is seeking royalties and damages for MCI's allegedly unauthorised use
of patented technologies over the past five years, as well as prospective
future use.
'We simply will not allow MCI to continue to get a free ride on our Dollars
3bn annual investment in research and development,' said Ms Judith Maynes, a
lawyer for AT&amp;T.
The dispute first surfaced after MCI announced an alliance with Stentor, the
Canadian telecommunications consortium, in November.
AT&amp;T informed MCI and Stentor that their proposed use of MCI's intelligent
network technology in Canada would infringe upon AT&amp;T patents.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Black's bid to raise Fairfax
stake is delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday deferred for 90 days a decision on
whether to allow Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group to increase its
stake in the Fairfax newspaper chain from 14.33 per cent to 25 per cent.
The deferral means the government may not have to rule on the
politically-sensitive application until after the next federal election,
which is likely to be called within three months.
The application is believed to have support from some ministers, although it
is unclear whether Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, is sympathetic to
Mr Black's claim that Fairfax requires a strong main shareholder.
There is strong opposition in the ruling Labor party's parliamentary caucus
to any relaxation of the existing foreign investment guidelines, which limit
overseas ownership of newspapers to 20 per cent.
The guidelines were imposed by the caucus before the sale of Fairfax to a
consortium led by the Telegraph in December 1991. Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US
investment bank, owns 5 per cent of Fairfax.
Mr Dawkins is expected to produce a report to the federal Cabinet arguing
that ministers should put their collective weight behind a request to the
caucus to relax the rules. But Mr Neil O'Keefe, chairman of the caucus
transport and communications committee, said the government would have
difficulty in winning backbench support. 'There certainly would be
substantial opposition to it,' he said.
Mr Barry Jones, federal president of the Labor party, urged Mr Dawkins to
take into account the 'broader issue' of the need to reduce the
concentration of media ownership in Australia.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and
the Australian Financial Review, is responsible for about 20 per cent of
daily newspaper circulation. About 70 per cent is controlled by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Heseltine to explore EC coal options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, will travel to
Brussels tomorrow to explore options with EC officials for rescuing British
Coal.
High on his agenda will be ways of subsidising British Coal to enable it to
compete with coal imports and other types of fuel.
Mr Heseltine will be seeing Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition
commissioner, whose responsibilities include state aid to industry.
The UK gives the maximum support to its energy industry allowed under EC
policy. It is not clear whether that limit, based on informal agreements,
still holds after the appointment of a new commission on January 1.
Mr Heseltine has already decided against banning imports of French
electricity to take the pressure off British Coal. That remedy is thought to
be too complicated, given the launch this year of the single EC market and
the existence of long-term commercial contracts.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, met Mr Heseltine yesterday to discuss the
coal energy review but Downing Street said discussions were at a preliminary
stage.
British diplomats in Brussels said yesterday Mr Heseltine's visit was aimed
at establishing first contacts with new commissioners in his field -
principally Mr Abel Matutes, responsible for energy and transport, and Mr
Van Miert.
They confirmed that one of the principal subjects under discussion will be
how to soften the blow of pit closures in the UK through subsidies, perhaps
paid for by a levy imposed on consumers' electricity bills.
The commission's revised code for state aid to the EC coal industry, yet to
be adopted by member states, aims to tighten the screw on inefficient mines
in Spain and Germany.
Under the code, which should come into force in 1994, Britain would be under
no obligation to cut costs at its mines, which are already the most
efficient in the EC.
Leaders of the coal and rail unions dropped their demand yesterday for a
'stay away' day of action for January 19 to protest against the planned pit
closures.
After a meeting at TUC headquarters in London they said it was
'inappropriate' to go ahead with the day's protest given the High Court
ruling against 'immediate closure' of 10 of the 31 threatened pits.
The unions went on to call for a day of action next month in protest at the
plans.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: NHL pays Pounds 0.75m to former directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL HOME Loans, the troubled centralised mortgage lender, yesterday
disclosed that it paid Pounds 748,000 compensation to four board directors
who left the company after the full extent of its difficulties became clear.
NHL disclosed the payment in its annual report.
Shareholders were told that it had agreed to pay only one year's salary to
the directors involved, although their contracts provided for three years'
compensation.
The company said the directors involved were Mr Kevin Milner, its former
chief executive, Mr Anthony Moir, the former finance director, and Mr
Christopher Slay and Mr Kenneth Lewis, formerly executive directors.
The company's annual meeting - from which journalists were excluded - was
told that it was still trying to exchange two D-Mark bond issues worth a
total of Pounds 120.1m. It had expected to complete the transaction last
month.
Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said afterwards he now expected to
complete the transactions putting back the date when the loans have to be
repaid within six weeks. The company wants to make the loans due at the end
of 1995.
In November, NHL announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 146.4m, which cut its
net assets to Pounds 11.2m. Because net assets fell below half shareholders'
called-up share capital of Pounds 114.1m, the company had to call an
extraordinary meeting.
The EGM, held yesterday after the AGM, resolved to allow the current
management to continue with its strategy of trying to repay on-balance sheet
debts of Pounds 700m, and improve the flow of income from its mortgage
assets.
Mr Perry told the meeting that Pounds 120m of debt had been repaid since
June. He also said the group had increased margins by passing on only 1.35
percentage points of a 3 percentage point base rate fall to mortgage
borrowers.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Agency at Lloyd's acts to lift funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERRETT Group, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's insurance market,
yesterday announced the launch of a company formed to reinsure exclusively
business underwritten by its nine syndicates.
The deal - involving JP Morgan, the US investment bank, Marsh &amp; McLennan,
the world's biggest insurance broker, and other international investors -
represents the first step by any agency to attract corporate capital to the
Lloyd's market, following recommendations last year by the Rowland task
force.
Merrett Group itself will have no stake in Underwriters Capital (Merrett),
which will be Bermuda-based. But Mr Dennis Purkiss, chief executive,
insisted that the company represented 'a new source of capital' for the
group.
JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan will each invest Dollars 7m in Underwriters
Capital (Merrett). It will start with Dollars 70m in capital.
The new company will provide quota share reinsurance - reinsuring a certain
percentage of risks underwritten by Merrett syndicates in return for the
same percentage of the premium - for a minimum five-year period.
Many Lloyd's agencies are examining ways to attract outside capital as the
number of Names - individuals whose assets back the market's underwriting -
has declined. Mr Purkiss predicted that the deal might be the first of a
number at Lloyd's.
He said: 'There is not much doubt that Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan will use
it as a blueprint.'
Some syndicates have already taken advantage of new rules introduced by
Lloyd's last year allowing them to make greater use of quota share
reinsurance deals, but Merrett is the first agency to have negotiated
arrangements of this type.
Merrett Group's capacity - the maximum amount of premium it can underwrite
under Lloyd's rules - will amount to about Pounds 400m. Under the revised
regulations Merrett can underwrite an extra 25 per cent of that amount if
premiums in excess of this capacity are ceded to an outside quota share
reinsurer.
The government now has powers of intervention over underwriters in the
troubled Lloyd's of London insurance market, Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour
frontbencher told MPs last night as the Commons passed regulations bringing
a single European market in insurance closer to fruition.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Investment authority warned on standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Personal Investment Authority has been told by the Securities and
Investments Board that it will not receive authorisation to become the new
super-regulator of retail financial businesses unless it can prove it will
radically improve the regulation of the market.
A confidential letter from Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, to Sir Gordon
Downey, chairman of the authority, says the board wants a 'step change in
regulatory standards across the whole marketplace'. If the authority is
unable to deliver the necessary improvements, SIB warns: 'We will look to
other ways of achieving them'.
The letter represents the toughest action to date by Mr Large in his
attempts to improve standards of financial regulation since he became SIB
chairman last summer.
Senior life insurance and financial services company officials warned
yesterday that the SIB's tough stance might make it impossible for the PIA
to be formed, because of opposition from the financial industry.
'This is the end of the PIA,' said one member of the authority's formation
committee.
The authority is intended to be formed by the merger of two self-regulatory
organisations - Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for
financial intermediaries. As the letter says, it is intended to be the lead
regulator for firms selling 'life, pensions and unit trust products'.
Mr Large says: 'We now need to deliver a higher standard of investor
protection in this market place than has been possible hitherto.' The
seven-page letter sets out detailed conditions the authority must meet if it
is to gain SIB approval.
The letter emphasises that the authority cannot automatically accept all
members of Lautro and Fimbra. 'SIB expects members of the PIA to be
subjected to a rigorous assessment of fitness, properness and financial
standing,' the letter says.
The process of vetting the potential 7,000 members must start now, SIB says,
and should be largely completed by the middle of the year.
SIB also says the authority must demonstrate that it will have the resources
for improved monitoring of retail financial businesses and for more
effective enforcement of rules governing the industry.
'We are looking for a substantial commitment of top-quality resources and it
is obvious that this will be expensive,' the letter says. 'SIB is aware that
this will be unwelcome to PIA members, particularly the smaller ones.'
The letter also criticises the authority's proposal to have a board of 30
directors. It says that number should be halved.
In response to complaints from consumer groups that the authority would put
the interests of financial firms above those of investors, the SIB says that
a majority of the PIA's board members should be 'public-interest directors'
rather than representatives of the financial industry.
'Public-interest members' would include consumer lobbyists and individuals
who work outside the financial industry.
The SIB has responded to consumer complaints in a second respect. It is
insisting that the authority unify its procedures for handling complaints
from the public immediately, rather than continuing to operate the existing
complaints procedures of Fimbra and Lautro in tandem for a period.
The Consumers' Association welcomed the letter's position on public-interest
directors and on the tough procedures for admitting members to the
authority.
However, Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumer Association's money group,
criticised Mr Large's vision of the scope of the authority for not including
mortgages and deposit-based products.
The letter does respond to many of the banks' and building societies'
complaints about the authority - objections that have so far prevented them
agreeing to join it in respect of their life assurance and unit trust
operations.
The British Bankers Association, in its submission to the authority, asked
that no firm or individual be admitted to it without rigorous vetting.
Fimbra officials have said privately that such a rule would be viewed as an
effort to shake out weaker members. As a result, it is unlikely that the
requisite 70 per cent of its members would vote to merge Fimbra into the new
authority.
The letter will also worry Fimbra members because it reopens the issue of
whether all regulated financial firms should have minimum capital of Pounds
10,000. Many Fimbra members have far less capital.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Italians to build biggest cruise liner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S largest cruise liner could be plying the seas within four years
following an agreement yesterday on a contract estimated to be worth more
than Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) between Fincantieri, the Italian state-owned
shipbuilding group, and Carnival Cruises of the US.
The new vessel, to be built by Fincantieri at its Monfalcone yard near
Trieste, will weigh around 95,000 gross registered tons. That is over 20,000
tons more than the Sovereign of the Seas, the world's biggest cruise liner,
operated by Royal Caribbean Cruises.
With 1,300 cabins and space for around 4,400 passengers, the new vessel will
also be the most expensive of its kind and could open an era of new 'jumbo'
luxury passenger liners.
The contract confirms Fincantieri's position among leading cruise ship
builders. Though still heavily loss-making, the company has since the
mid-1980s exploited a growing demand for large luxury liners, principally in
the US, to develop an important new line of business. In spite of being
saddled with some warships built for Iraq, it now claims to be trading
profitably.
The yard is building three 55,000 ton sister ships for Holland America Line,
an affiliate of Carnival Cruises.
The new vessel, as yet unnamed, will be powered by six massive GMT-Sulzer
diesel electric engines, which will provide 'the most powerful propulsion
package for a vessel of its kind,' according to a Fincantieri official. In
spite of its size, the 'per berth' price of the new ship will be competitive
with other vessels being built for Carnival, he said.
Carnival Cruises, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is the
world's largest cruise line in terms of passengers carried. It operates 18
ships, mainly in the Caribbean and Alaska, and has tried to break away from
the staid image of cruise holidays with entertainment-oriented vessels with
names such as Sensation and Fantasy.

AS MANY as 400 people may have been killed in fighting with Mr Jonas
Savimbi's Unita movement as the rebel leader's troops prepared a mercenary
invasion from neighbouring Zaire, Angolan state radio reported yesterday,
Reuter reports from Luanda.
Fighting spread to the oil-producing northern Zaire province and there were
reports that government planes bombed Mr Savimbi's headquarters in central
Huambo. Unita said that many civilians have been killed in the government
offensive.
Officials in Luanda insisted yesterday that Mr Savimbi, who has fought the
MPLA government for most of the past 18 years, had been driven from his
headquarters in Huambo.
State radio said Mr Savimbi had left Angola and was planning a
mercenary-backed invasion of Angola from Zaire. Zaire has denied the report.
Angolan state radio said Unita was preparing to attack the Soyo oilfields.
The radio said Unita had also destroyed five oil wells owned by Fina Oil, at
Picotas about 12 miles from Soyo.
The radio said Unita troops had massed at the Manga Grande, Quelo, and Sumba
communes to mount a large-scale attack into Zaire Province and said lorries
coming from the Republic of Zaire with weapons and mercenaries.
The radio said Unita troops were also gathering near Menongue, the capital
of Angola's southern Cuando-Cubango province and were preparing to attack
the city.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Shutdown of unused Thorp N-plant would cost Pounds 70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuel's Thorp re-processing plant at Sellafield would cost
about Pounds 70m to decommission even if it never began operation, says an
unpublished BNFL report to the government.
Several thousand tonnes of radioactive fuel sent early to the plant by
overseas customers have already contaminated storage ponds at the
controversial Cumbrian plant, which has taken nearly 10 years and cost
Pounds 2.8bn to build.
The report by consultants Touche Ross was sent to the Department of Trade
and Industry last month. It says failure to open Thorp would lose the UK
between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m a year in overseas revenues for the next
10 years. The report is the basis of BNFL's claim a sound economic case
exists for the plant.
The DTI, together with the Environment Department and the Foreign Office, is
debating whether the plant should be allowed to start operating.
Since Thorp (Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant) won approval from the 1977
Windscale inquiry, the economic, environmental and political reasons for
reprocessing 'spent' or used nuclear fuel have changed. The report's
financial models, which BNFL refuses to publish but which have been seen by
the Financial Times, were criticised yesterday by economists for
underestimating the costs of running and decommissioning Thorp and relying
on projections of revenue, mainly from Japan and Germany.
Mr William Walker, a senior fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit at
Sussex University and co-author of a report criticising the economic case
for Thorp, said: 'The problem with models like this is that it is extremely
difficult to predict what the actual costs of cancellation would be. In
reality, Thorp and its customers would get together in a smoke-filled room
and hammer out a deal.'
Customers' contracts with BNFL specify that they must take back the
plutonium, uranium and high-level waste generated by reprocessing, but the
row over a recent shipment of plutonium from France to Japan has highlighted
diplomatic and environmental concerns.
The report assumes that if Thorp was not opened, the fuel which is already
there would be sent back to the overseas utilities who sent it, but that the
costs of storing and shipping it could exceed Pounds 10m a year for much of
the next decade.
BNFL said yesterday: 'We cannot comment on details of the Touche Ross report
but we have always maintained that Thorp represents an excellent piece of
business for the UK and for BNFL.'

Maria Rodriguez likes mending trucks. Giant trucks, the size of three-storey
buildings, which shift tonnes of rock from Chuquicamata, the world's biggest
copper mine in Chile's Atacama desert.
Eva Ramos would love to drive one of these mechanised monsters. She thinks
it would be little different from driving her fork-lift truck; it would only
be a question of getting used to the size.
Eva is also responsible for the tools at Chuquicamata's maintenance
workshops. She doesn't mind the girlie posters on the walls. Wolf-whistles,
she says, have become part of the background noise.
Eva, Maria and a growing number of women miners, mechanics, engineers and
geologists form part of the army of shock troops that are storming this most
macho of male bastions - the mining industry. Born and bred in the desert,
they are as tough as their husbands and fathers who know no other occupation
than mining.
Some of the women miners at Chuquicamata are widows who took over their
husbands' jobs after fatal accidents at the mine. And although women are
outnumbered by more than 10-to-one at the 9,000-strong mining camp, they say
sexual harassment is not a problem. It is a cause of instant dismissal at
Chuquicamata.
Sexual barriers are crumbling as a foreign investment boom in Chilean copper
and gold mines creates a shortage of skilled labour. It was only in October
last year that women were first allowed to enter El Teniente, the biggest
underground copper mine in the world, because of a centuries-old
superstition that women brought bad luck and pit accidents.
At La Escondida, a Dollars 900m (Pounds 592m) copper operation inaugurated
by RTZ and BHP of Australia two years ago, women have moved from secretarial
jobs to operating computer controls in the production plant. La Escondida
also employs women crane drivers, engineers, technicians and metallurgical
specialists. They work the same shifts as their male colleagues and share
dormitories at the mining camp while their families remain in Antofagasta.
The company operates an equal opportunities policy and encourages women to
acquire new skills through their training programmes. Although Chilean women
are breaking new professional ground, they have not yet shattered the 'glass
ceiling' that keeps them subordinate to men.
The state copper company Codelco, which operates Chuquicamata and three
other mines, has 25,000 employees but not a single female executive. Only a
smattering of women occupy managerial posts.
Even multinationals must bow to the machismo that pervades Chilean society.
One Canadian mining executive says: 'I have not been able to hire qualified
women to senior positions because Chilean men would refuse to work under
them.'
As for Chilean executives, the idea of promoting women to top posts does not
even occur to them. Partly as a result, the female 'brain drain' from Chile
has been considerable.
The first woman mining engineer graduated from the University of Chile 40
years ago but her successors have been forced to venture as far as Zaire and
Canada to further their careers. The women at Chuquicamata are determined to
change this state of affairs. They formed a Corporation of Women Copper
Workers two years ago and with 500 members it is the biggest womens'
organisation in Chile.
At the beginning, says Angelica Guinez, their president, the corporation was
regarded with suspicion by management and unions alike. 'They thought 500
women together spelled trouble.'
While none of the women at Chuquicamata describe themselves as feminists,
they nevertheless feel the need to fight for visibility, respect and equal
opportunities. 'It is a daily struggle to prove your worth,' says Gladys
Romero, a fork-lift truck driver at the maintenance workshops. 'It took me
about a year to convince my boss that I was up to the job. The men here
don't like women invading their territory.'
After mending Codelco's giant trucks for 13 years, Maria Rodriguez would
like to be promoted to the foreman's job. She believes male prejudice is
holding her back. 'As a woman,' she says, 'you are watched like a hawk. I
cannot afford to slip up. If I take time off to take a sick child to
hospital, it will be held against me at work. But if a man doesn't turn up
because he has a hangover, the only thing he gets is commiseration.'
The Corporation of Women Copper Miners is particularly proud of the fact
that their organisation has broken the rigid management-worker divide that
governs labour relations at the desert mining camp. Their members include
truck drivers and secretaries, nurses, mechanics, teachers and metallurgical
engineers.
They have organised conferences on labour psychology, legal rights for women
and assertiveness training courses. Last year they managed to elect the
first female representative on to one of Codelco's unions. Management has
also recently begun inviting them to discuss policy decisions.
But the real breakthrough, they say, will come when male colleagues cease to
regard them as too 'fragile' or 'emotional' for certain jobs. Looking over
Chuquicamata's huge crater during the noon blast, Elena Alcayaga says:
'What's so dangerous about handling a few dynamite sticks? I'd love to do
that.'

EXPORTFINANS, Norway's export lending institution, has launched a Dollars
100m issue of preferred capital securities, a new commercial paper developed
with Goldman Sachs, lead-manager of the issue.
Preferred capital securities are designed to allow access to tier one core
capital. The issue, launched in the US, boosts Exportfinans' capital
adequacy from 38 per cent to 46 per cent.
'For us the challenge was to find a structure acceptable to US authorities
which would also qualify as tier one core capital as defined by Norway. It
was also important for us to get a dollar element base,' explained Ms
Mai-Lill Ibsen, executive vice-president of Exportfinans.
Exportfinans is the first Nordic institution to use PCS to access regulatory
capital in the international markets.
The issue, set to yield 8.70 per cent, closes tomorrow and is co-lead by
Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Paine Webber.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: C&amp;N's Thai tiger devours its
parent - How the construction group was taken over by its far-eastern
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING illustrates the dynamism of Asian companies compared with their
European counterparts as clearly as the recent reverse takeover of
Copenhagen-based Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the construction and engineering
group, by its Thai subsidiary for the equivalent of Dollars 80m.
Founded in 1904 by a civil engineer and a captain in the Danish navy, C&amp;N
has long been a name to conjure with in the international construction
industry; the company pioneered the use of reinforced concrete at the
beginning of the century and went on to develop other innovative
techniques,, including immersed tube tunnels.
C&amp;N carried out projects in 70 countries and, at its peak, had 35,000
employees. 'They were really the golden years, the late 1970s and early
1980s,' says Mr John Millard, the group's chief executive and managing
director.
Today, the C&amp;N group employs only about 5,000 people, of whom 4,500 are in
Thailand.
Disaster struck the rest of the company in 1986 and 1987, when currency
chaos in South America devalued the group's substantial assets there and
eight big projects around the world all went wrong at the same time, Mr
Millard said.
In 1987, Mr Arne Groes, a Danish property developer, stepped in and bought
the company's A shares, which meant control of C&amp;N passed from the
Christiani family. But Mr Groes had a stroke two years ago, leaving the
company in the hands of an attorney who was not allowed to move assets
freely within the group.
Wholly-owned subsidiaries in the UK and Germany were therefore in a
'corset', according to Mr Millard. C&amp;N Ltd, the UK company, is expected to
report a loss for 1992, while the Hamburg-based German company and C&amp;N A/S,
the Danish parent, have been barely breaking even.
Mr Millard, a Briton who joined the group in 1985 and was asked in 1988 'to
look after a project called Canary Wharf', says the Pounds 40m (Dollars 61m)
of foundations for the project's waterside buildings sharply increased C&amp;N
Ltd's turnover and virtually saved the group. 'We did get paid,' he said.
The situation in Thailand could not have been more different from the
troubles in Europe. With the economy growing at an average 10 per cent a
year since 1987, C&amp;N (Thai), or CNT, has prospered and outgrown its European
parent. Turnover and profits have risen more than tenfold in five years. It
was listed on the local stock exchange in 1991.
'From there on, it has really gone from strength to strength in Thailand,'
says Mr Millard. The order book is worth Dollars 270m and the company is
active on Thailand's eastern seaboard, the focus of new industrial
investment.
'We saw a situation where the assets, human and practical, of the European
companies were being stifled,' he says, 'whereas this (Thai) company was in
rather a strong position to release those restraints and put their resources
to profitable use.'
Stockbrokers say CNT was worried that anyone smart enough to see the value
of the Danish parent's 42 per cent stake in the Thai unit might launch a
takeover bid. So CNT made its own offer for the parent company in September,
when the C&amp;N A/S share price in Copenhagen reflected only just over half the
value of its CNT stake.
The outcome of negotiations with Mr Groes's attorney is that CNT is buying
the A shares, representing control, but only 25 per cent of the capital, for
DKr260 (Dollars 43.3) per share.
Holders of B shares were offered DKr130, more than double the price at which
the shares were suspended in Copenhagen. And CNT effectively bought 42 per
cent of itself for Bt108 (Dollars 4.2) per share, against the Thai
suspension price of Bt129. When trading in the shares resumed in Bangkok,
the shares were being bid at Bt141, but have since risen to above Bt170.
To reduce the crossholding to an acceptable 10 per cent, existing CNT
shareholders, the largest of which is Thailand's Crown Property Bureau, will
be offered 32 per cent of CNT at Bt108 per share in a rights issue without
dilution.
With 98 per cent of CNN A/S shares already secured, CNT has succeeded in
keeping the internationally known Christiani &amp; Nielsen name and can make
plans to inject life into the group's European operations from the new
headquarters in Bangkok.
C&amp;N Ltd, the UK company, is expected to carry out design and construction
for a Dollars 200m joint venture in northern China. 'The UK company is in
need of profitable work,' says Mr Millard. 'We can redirect those
resources.'
This does not mean C&amp;N is abandoning Europe, Mr Millard emphasises. These
days, however, it is the Thai company which is calling the shots.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: ISMA rules confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has confirmed the rules of the International
Securities Market Association do not breach EC competition law, the bond
market trade association said yesterday, writes Richard Waters.
The EC 'comfort letter', first sought by ISMA in March 1990, gives the
association limited protection from legal action under EC law, said Mr John
Langton, secretary-general of the association.
ISMA decided to seek the EC's assurance since it is not subject to any
single national regulatory system - although it is a Designated Investment
Exchange in the UK and its rules are reviewed by the UK's Office of Fair
Trading.
Before issuing its letter, the EC last year forced the association to drop
two rules which had restricted inter-dealer brokers in the international
bond markets to dealing only with market-makers, rather than with end
investors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOLIDATION of the French retail sector continued yesterday with the
announcement of an alliance between Domaxel and Semaphor, two leading home
products retailing groups.
Domaxel is a group of independent French retailers involved in the
do-it-yourself and household products market which owns 533 stores under the
names Bricosphere, Maison Conseil and Bricofrance.
Semaphor is another group of independents with 108 stores, including Jardin
Facile and Planete Verte, mainly specialising in garden products.
The two groups have signed an agreement whereby they will merge, on a
commercial basis, for two years.
The agreement does not include any exchange of equity between them.
Domaxel sees the deal as a way into the buoyant garden products market. It
plans to open garden products departments in a number of its own stores.
Semaphor, the smaller of the two companies with annual sales of FFr500m
(Dollars 92.6m) to Domaxel's FFr6.8bn, needed to join forces with a larger
player to continue its expansion.
The alliance is the latest in a series of deals in the French retail sector.
The home products sector has been one of the main areas of consolidation
following the Pinault group's purchase of the Conforama furniture chain in
1991 and its subsequent takeover of the Au Printemps store group, together
with a number of mergers in the hypermarkets sector.

<TEXT>
THE government of Guyana has suspended the privatisation of state-owned
enterprises saying the programme was not 'credible'. It will say in March
whether it will continue to sell state property.
Mr Asgar Ally, finance minister, said the government 'will have to review
what happened with earlier agreements, what went wrong and how things should
not be done'.
The government's review will delay the privatisation of 10 companies which
the previous government had said it wanted to divest. These include the
national airline, and the sugar and bauxite industries, two main pillars of
the economy.
While in opposition, Mr Cheddi Jagan, the new president, had frequently
criticised the privatisation programme, attacking the manner in which the
government was concluding deals with foreign investors.

Reuter reports from London.
Mr Rifkind said that the Ministry of Defence was handling talks with the
Kuwaiti authorities about Warrior and Piranha armoured fighting vehicles
made by GKN, the British engineering company.
The negotiations follow disappointment in Britain that Kuwait had chosen
American-designed M1A tanks rather than the British Challenger II in the
wake of the Gulf war with Iraq.
Mr Rifkind said that Britain's share of the world market for vehicles in the
Warrior and Piranha class had risen to 20 per cent from 17 per cent in the

FT  13 JAN 93 / Magistrates move on Craxi charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN magistrates yesterday submitted their request to the Italian
parliament to waive immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, in
order for him to face charges of alleged corruption and illegal financing of
his party.
The magistrates are understood to have listed 22 separate episodes involving
Mr Craxi. Most of these relate to alleged kick-backs on public works
contracts. The document, running to 118 pages, is far more extensive than
those on 13 members of the senate and chamber of deputies involved in the
Milan corruption scandal.
In previous cases it has taken as long as five months for the process to
pass through the two houses of parliament. Mr Craxi was served notice he was
under investigation on December 15.
But last Friday he was served with a second notice that he was under
investigation for two further instances of alleged corruption.
Mr Craxi last month declined to step down from the party leadership but is
under mounting pressure to do so at a special party congress due to be held
before the end of January. The plight of Mr Craxi and the Socialist
leadership crisis has raised once again the fate of the four-party coalition
government of Mr Giuliano Amato.
The Socialists are the principal partners alongside the Christian Democrats
in the coalition.
Mr Amato has publicly stated he has no wish to head both the government and
the party and one compromise being touted is for him to assume the
presidency, with Mr Claudio Maretelli, the ambitious justice minister,
becoming secretary.
This formula could enable the government to stay in office. However, a
number of leading opposition politicians including Mr Achille Occhetto,
leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), Mr
Umberto Bossi of the Lombard League and Mr Girogio La Malfa of the small
Republican party have begun to call for a broader-based government.
In recent days they have argued that only a government representing all the
main political forces has the strength and legitimacy to preside over the
introduction of electoral reform, which has now moved to the top of the
agenda.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Ciba cuts landfill dumping of waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK subsidiary of Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss chemicals and drugs group, has
reported its environmental emissions for the first time.
The figures, for 1991, show a marked increase in the level of waste the
company incinerates, but a fall in the amount sent for landfill. Ciba-Geigy
believes incineration is more environmentally friendly.
The company refused to provide details of production levels or how much it
had spent on environmental protection.
Ciba-Geigy estimates it used 12.8m tonnes of water in 1991, compared with
14.3m tonnes in 1990. Emissions of halogenated organic compounds, containing
fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, fell from 200 tonnes to 168 tonnes.
Ciba-Geigy says those are a priority.
Inorganic aqueous effluent fell from 39,000 tonnes to 34,026 tonnes, while
emissions of ammoniacal nitrogen fell from 1,545 tonnes to 1,375 tonnes.
Emissions to the air dropped overall, although the level of non-halogenated
organic materials increased from 1,618 tonnes to 1,693 tonnes. Halogenated
organics fell 16 per cent from 455 tonnes to 384 tonnes, while sulphur
dioxide, implicated in acid rain, fell 28 per cent from 1,792 tonnes to
1,305 tonnes. Nitrogen oxides fell 40 per cent from 692 tonnes to 416
tonnes.
A comparison of carbon dioxide emissions - thought to create the greenhouse
effect - was not possible, although the company admitted producing 211,000
tonnes in 1991.
Special waste production fell from 20,475 tonnes to 19,314 tonnes. Waste
incinerated at high temperature increased 47 per cent from 6,437 to 9,483
tonnes, that sent for landfill fell 22 per cent from 36,176 tonnes to 28,382
tonnes.

MOTORCYCLE sales last December were 35.5 per cent higher than the figure for
December 1991 at 1,970 bikes, the Motor Cycle Industry Association said.
Total motorcycle sales for all of last year were 43,992. That was down on
the 1991 figure of 51,781, but the association said the rate of decline had

FT  13 JAN 93 / Doubts about education policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEADS of the new universities and colleges of higher education are sceptical
about the extension of performance-related pay and have little faith in the
government's ability to conduct a coherent higher education policy, a Gallup
survey said.
Price Waterhouse, the consultancy company, received payments of more than
Pounds 3m to help set up the government's student loans scheme, according to
the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog.
That was more than Pounds 400,000 above budget, and represented nearly 6 per
cent of the cost of the scheme, including loans made, over its first two
years.

THE first test case on local-authority swap agreements reached the High
Court yesterday, two years after the House of Lords ruled that UK local
councils had exceeded their powers by entering swap agreements with banks.
The decision left banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, a portion of which
they have recovered by seeking restitution of interest paid to councils
under the agreements.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer and former Guinness director, misled no one
over the nature of the Pounds 5.2m 'success fee' paid to him by the company
after its takeover of Distillers, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
In an unusual move, addressing the jury before any witness gave evidence,
his counsel, Mr Anthony Trollope QC, said Mr Ward strongly denied the
accusation that he had stolen the money by pretending it was for a third
party.
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, had agreed to the
success fee and Mr Olivier Roux, the company's former finance director, had
known the nature of the payment before authorising it, Mr Trollope said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS BEGAN a High Court challenge yesterday to the investors
compensation scheme, run by the Securities and Investments Board, over the
method of assessing how much should be paid to victims of home income plans
whose brokers or advisers become insolvent.
In four test cases, solicitors Barnett Sampson, acting for about 450 people,
said the ICS failed to comply with the relevant rules or acted unreasonably,
making its decisions on payouts invalid.
Home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as
a means of releasing cash from the value of their properties.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Many auditors are 'unsatisfactory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST two thirds of the auditors monitored by the Association of Authorised
Public Accountants were judged unsatisfactory last year, a report on audit
regulation showed yesterday.
Of the 49 visits to 554 registered auditors in the 12 months to last
September, the regulators judged seven 'unacceptable', 25 'not
satisfactory', 13 'reasonable' and only four 'satisfactory'.
The findings come in the first audit regulation report submitted to the
Department of Trade and Industry by the association, which represents 1,100
individuals authorised to conduct audits and not covered by the two other
authorised audit registration bodies.
Most of its members are older accountants who qualified before company
legislation enshrined the certified and chartered accountants' professional
bodies as the primary regulatory bodies for those conducting audits.
As with the report on Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
auditors earlier this week, the high number of unsatisfactory scores
reflected a failure to maintain formal recording of reporting procedures
rather than the quality of audit work conducted, the report says.
However, three firms or individuals have had their registration withdrawn
during the year, while a further seven are under investigation.
From 634 applications received for audit registration during the first year
554 were accepted and 35 were rejected. A further 35 applications were
withdrawn by the applicants. There were 18 complaints during the year,
including four concerning excessive fees, five on standards of accounting
and four on lateness in dealing with clients' affairs.
The association's council said it was confident that the new audit
inspection regime would cause standards to 'radically improve', because
firms were taking positive steps to improve their procedures.
The costs of monitoring and audit regulation - which are sub-contracted to
the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants - were Pounds 85,000 last
year, while development costs in previous years were about Pounds 90,000.
The association achieved its target for the number of visits to members
during the year and expects to visit each registered auditor once every five
years.
The accountancy profession's joint disciplinary scheme yesterday defended
its decision to take no further action in connection with the affairs of
Alexander Howden, Minet and WMD Underwriting Agencies.
The scheme launched an inquiry in 1991 after references to 10 individual
accountants in a 1990 Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report
and a 1985 report for the Committee of Lloyd's.
Sir Anthony Wilson, chairman of the scheme's executive committee, said that
a decision to proceed might have contravened 'the rules of natural justice'.
His comments come after criticism of the scheme's decision in three reports
issued last week to take no further action against any of the 10 members
mentioned.
The decision means that the scheme must absorb more than Pounds 100,000
already spent in legal costs, which will be contributed by its members, the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, and the Institutes of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and of Scotland.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Ulster troops fired without warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERCOVER troops shot and killed an IRA terrorist without first giving him
a chance to surrender, an inquest in Northern Ireland ruled last night.
The decision by the coroner's jury in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, that troops
did not challenge Seamus McElwaine could open the way for legal action by
his relatives.
In the shooting, which took place nearly seven years ago near the village of
Roslea, Co Fermanagh, McElwaine was killed and another terrorist wounded as
they prepared a culvert bomb ambush on security forces.
At the time McElwaine was on the run from the top-security Maze prison after
being part of a IRA jailbreak.
The inquest jury also decided that five minutes after the four soldiers
involved first shot McElwaine, they fired again as he lay injured.
The troops insisted that the pair were challenged just before they opened
fire.
Last night Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, called for the four
soldiers to be charged with murder and for Mr Archie Hamilton, the defence
minister, to face criminal charges.
It claimed that the ruling once again highlighted Britain's 'shoot-to-kill'
policy.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Britannia to shed jobs and buy aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIA Airways, Britain's biggest charter airline, is to spend Pounds
250m on new aircraft and shed 560 jobs in an efficiency drive.
The aircraft order includes a Pounds 40m engine contract with Rolls-Royce.
Britannia, subsidiary of Thomson Holidays, Britain's biggest package tour
operator, will cut 290 jobs in its engineering division and 160 pilots.
Mr Roger Burnell, managing director of Britannia, said some compulsory
redundancies would be inevitable.
The cuts come largely because the company's new fleet will consist of fewer,
larger aircraft. Mr Burnell said: 'By summer 1994 we will have 29 aircraft
compared with 38 in summer 1992. The new aircraft will need less
maintenance, so we will need fewer pilots and engineers.'
Pilots will spend more time flying as a result of a new rostering system and
changes to employment contracts. Extra cabin crew will be taken on.
Britannia, based in Luton, Bedfordshire, is buying five new Boeing 757s from
Boeing in a deal worth Dollars 275m (Pounds 181m). Another two will come
from Los Angeles based International Lease Finance Corporation.
Each 757 will carry up to 235 passengers in an all-economy seating
configuration.
By the summer of 1994, Britannia's fleet will consist entirely of Boeing
757s and the larger, wide-bodied 767s. Both models are capable of flying
across the Atlantic, unlike the shorter-range 737s.
Mr Burnell said the fleet modernisation would increase the capacity of the
airline by about 5 per cent, even though fewer aircraft would be operated.
He said the holiday industry had been little affected by the economic
recession. Britannia's sales last year amounted to about Pounds 550m, 14 per
cent higher than in 1991. Sales this year would be about the same as last
year.
Britannia also announced yesterday that its ground handling operation at
Luton would be taken over by Serviceair. About 35 research jobs in Dorset
will be reprieved in a review of government plans for cutting more than
2,000 staff at the restructured Defence Research Agency.
Closure plans for 15 sites were confirmed in a written Commons reply by Mr
Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister. The cuts, which involve
abandoning almost a third of the DRA's sites, are aimed at saving Pounds 90m
a year.

FT  13 JAN 93 / N Sea Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn investment 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil and gas producers yesterday warned the government that
offshore investment of Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn is at risk if it tries to
stop the development of gas-fired power stations as part of its energy
review.
'Government intervention in the free market for gas could risk the
abandonment or delay of 25 North Sea projects . . . and imperil 55,000
jobs,' said Mr John Parziale, president of the UK Offshore Operators
Association and managing director of Marathon Oil's UK operations.
The jobs affected would be in the design, construction and servicing of
North Sea projects as well as 5,000 permanent jobs on platforms producing
gas.
Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada Hess's UK arm, said he was
having difficulty in selling gas from two of his fields because of the
uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the review. 'Gas is noticeably more
difficult to market than it was three months ago,' he said.
Offshore operators say they are worried that any government intervention
will damage confidence in the industry to such an extent that companies will
take their investment elsewhere.
The row between British Gas and its regulator, Ofgas, has cost about 5,000
jobs and a fall in turnover of Pounds 100m among the gas contracting and
manufacturing industries, said Mr John Cull, president of the Society of
British Gas Industries.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Carsberg ordered to limit bus probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has been ordered by
the High Court to vary the terms of a reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission after the first successful legal challenge to a decision
by the UK competition authorities.
The Office of Fair Trading said yesterday it had no plans to appeal against
a judgment by Mr Justice Auld on Monday in proceedings brought by Southdown
Motor Services, a south coast bus company.
The MMC reference followed an OFT investigation last summer that found
evidence of uneconomic pricing by Southdown on two routes in Bognor Regis,
designed to drive a rival operator out of the market.
The company challenged the reference on the ground that Sir Bryan unlawfully
extended the scope of the inquiry by asking the commission to investigate
all local bus services in the Bognor Regis area.
The judge said that once the terms of an investigation under the 1980
Competition Act had been set by reference to a specific geographic area, it
was not open to the director-general to widen the scope of the investigation
when making a reference to the MMC. The reference to the MMC should be
restricted to the investigation of uneconomic pricing on the two routes
originally investigated by the OFT, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PEDESTRIAN took to skis in Aberdeen yesterday when snow virtually
paralysed Scotland as hundreds of roads were closed by drifts and abandoned
cars.
Police appealed to drivers not to travel needlessly as gales lashed the
country, closing schools, disrupting rail services and leaving thousands of
homes in East Kilbride without power.
A pregnant woman was taken to hospital in a police convoy led by a
snowplough after an RAF rescue helicopter twice failed to reach her home in
Aviemore.
The main A9 trunk road to the Highlands was closed, cutting off the northern
part of the country.
Some minor roads in Edinburgh were closed, and an Automobile Association
official said: 'It is just chaos across the whole of the country.'
The blizzards were the result of a record low-pressure system crossing the
north of the British Isles which also brought chaos south of the border,
hitting Northern Ireland, the north of England, much of Wales and the West
Country.
In Wiltshire a woman driver died when she got out of her car after a
collision and was hit by a car that skidded into a lay-by.
The London Weather Centre said there was no sign of any immediate
improvement, with high winds predicted for the rest of the week, more snow
expected in the north and sleet showers spreading across central and
southern England as temperatures fell.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Share option 'may be failing in aim'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DIRECTORS exercising share options in the second quarter of 1992
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the period spanning the general election - typically realised a gain of 80
per cent, according to Income Data Services, the independent pay research
group.
The study suggests that share options - the right to buy shares in the
company one works for at a future date but at today's prices - may be
failing in their aim of binding directors to their employers over the long
term. The gain may be a paper one if the shares are held, or a real one if
sold.
IDS said: 'Share options are a neglected element of the current corporate
governance debate, but, given that our analysis shows they are a substantial
part of directors' remuneration package, it could be that more attention
should be focused on them.'
The study, based on a sample of 153 share options exercised by directors of
quoted companies in the second quarter of 1992, found that the median cash
gain was Pounds 49,200. For directors of FT-SE 100 companies only, the gain
was Pounds 94,980 - well below the Pounds 142,606 in the last quarter of
1991.
IDS said: 'Every quarter has its own factors which will influence the value
of shares. We have heard arguments which suggest directors who feared a
Labour victory tended to exercise their options ahead of the general
election, and equally some exercising their options after the election when
the market rose. But we have no direct evidence of the effect.'
The study confirmed an earlier IDS options analysis finding that directors
tended to exercise their options after an average of 4 1/2 years - at the
'earliest opportunity'. Options must be held for three years and exercised
within 10.
IDS said, 'Share options were originally devised partly as a long-term
incentive to tie in the behaviour of top directors with their companies. The
study suggests they may not be really working.'

FT  13 JAN 93 / Cleveland Iron plant to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL said yesterday that it was closing Cleveland Iron, the UK's
only supplier of foundry iron and ferromanganese, with the loss of 200 jobs.
The Teesside plant, centred on two blast furnaces commissioned in 1911 and
1939, serves customers in the UK, continental Europe and the US as well as
supplying British Steel's own ferromanganese needs.
British Steel will buy ferromanganese, used in steelmaking, on the open
market.
It said the closure, to take effect by the end of March, was due to reduced
customer requirements as a result of global overcapacity, which had led to
falling prices. It declined to give details of the plant's financial
performance.
Mr Ted Hardaker, senior Teesside divisional organiser of the Iron and Steel
Trades Confederation, said he was appalled. 'Until we get some kind of
interventionist philosophy adopted by this government, we're just going to
sit and watch our manufacturing base disappear,' he said.
The ISTC and craft unions are holding a meeting of the plant's workforce on
Friday, but opposition to closure is unlikely. If other workers in British
Steel's 4,400 Teesside workforce volunteer for redundancy, some of the 200
may replace them, but Mr Hardaker predicted compulsory redundancies.
Cleveland Iron is part of the oldest site in British Steel's complex on
Teesside. In Victorian times the area was the world's leading producer of
iron.
The plant's customers include Ford, which uses its foundry iron for castings
and last year gave Cleveland Iron a suppliers' quality award. Ford said it
was keen to continue sourcing raw materials in the UK where possible. 'If
the implication of this decision is that we'll have to import material,
we'll be disappointed.'

FT  13 JAN 93 / American South places emphasis on new skills: Moves to
switch to services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF INVESTING in people is a central tenet of the incoming Clinton
administration, it will come as no surprise to the American South.
As an Arkansan, the roots of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic
perspective lie in the South's experience: a region that, sooner than the
rest of the nation, has bumped up against the barrier to economic growth
that poor skills and low productivity represent.
Cheap labour and low production costs used to draw US companies southward
from the north-east and Midwest. But developing countries have outbid the US
South on labour and taken unskilled manufacturing jobs. 'We cannot compete
with low-cost labour in other parts of the world,' says Mr Moncure Crowder,
chief economist at the Atlanta-based Wachovia Bank.
The prime example of this shift is in the textile and apparel industry,
which, even with modern equipment, is still labour intensive. While textile
and apparel companies continue to lead in manufacturing employment in the
south-east, the industry lost 271,000 jobs between 1970 and 1989, according
to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Many of these jobs went
abroad, and the prospect that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) could bring further erosion of such jobs has many southerners
worried.
The threat is worse given that the region's manufacturing jobs account for
nearly 25 per cent of employment compared to 17 per cent nationally,
according to Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University.
The region's job base could further be hit by defence spending cuts. The axe
could fall on both the South's many military bases - which during the second
world war gave the region its first big economic impetus - and local defence
industries.
The region's politicians are trying to shift from a manufacturing-based
low-skill economy dependent to a services-based economy more reliant on
knowledge. At the recent annual meeting of the Southern Growth Policies
Board, a regional think-tank, West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton said:
'If you keep doing things the way you're doing them, you'll keep getting
what you've got.'
Although the South has prospered during the Sunbelt boom of the last 20
years, it is still behind in incomes and living standards. In the crescent
of 12 states from West Virginia to Florida and across to Arkansas, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports average per capita income is only
89 per cent of the national average.
Southerners maintain that there is no mystery why this is so: although
economic and social conditions in the 12 states vary considerably, the
region has higher levels of children in poverty, adult illiteracy and
inadequate public education. In many states, between a third and a half of
first-year university students need remedial education. 'In education, we're
still scraping along the bottom,' says Mr Jeffrey Rosensweig, an economist
at Emory University's business school in the Atlanta area.
On the other hand, the tide of skilled workers from other parts of the US
attracted by the Sunbelt boom has helped fill the labour demands of new and
expanding businesses. For example, in Atlanta, the region's business and
financial capital, an estimated 60 per cent of its 3m people are not native
to the city. And, despite the region's being hit by the 1991 recession, it's
appeal - warm climate, relatively low cost of living, high personal income
growth - persists, particularly along the dynamic Atlantic seaboard.
Foreign investors have felt the pull of the South's low wages and relative
absence of unions. UK, Japanese and German companies have favoured the
region since the 1970s, when the pervasive racism that marred the area
abated. One out of four Americans who worked for foreign-owned companies at
the end of 1990 was in the South, the BLS says.
Some analysts believe that foreign trade could be the next big impetus for
the region's economy. However, others caution that, if the South does not
raise the skill level of its workforce, these opportunities may go with the
wind.

MR PAUL MOZER, former head bond trader at Wall Street brokerage house
Salomon Brothers and the central figure in the 1991 Treasury auction
scandal, was indicted by federal prosecutors last night on a variety of
criminal charges.
This follows a judge's decision to reject a plea agreement drawn up by Mr
Mozer's lawyers and the government on the grounds that there were still too
many issues outstanding for a guilty plea to be accepted. After the
rejection, prosecutors drew up the new indictment, which charges Mr Mozer
with securities fraud, two counts of making false statements to Treasury
officials, and one of preparing false books and records.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Bentsen aims to revive G7 policy forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will try to revive policy co-ordination between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, President-elect Bill
Clinton's choice for Treasury secretary, indicated in a Senate confirmation
hearing yesterday.
The G7 had 'fallen into disrepair,' he said. Members needed to hold more
frequent, informal meetings and put together 'a growth policy that would
expand the economies of all seven countries'. He said he favoured private
negotiation rather than public bullying.
He would like to see G7 summits get back to their original economic purpose
rather than serve as public relations exercises for world leaders.
Mr Bentsen received fulsome tributes from Democratic and Republican members
of the Senate finance committee, which he has chaired for the past six
years. In a sign of respect the committee voted unanimously to recommend his
nomination before asking any questions.
Mr Bentsen, 71, said the overriding goal was 'to put our economy on course
so every American has the prospect of a life-enriching job and a personal
chance at the American dream'. He would strive for 3 per cent, or better,
growth of gross domestic product.
He signalled that a balance would be struck between new investment and
fiscal restraint. There had to be a 'very major emphasis on deficit
reduction' but it was also vital to spur more long-term investment, mainly
in the private sector.
An investment tax credit was being seriously considered. However, he
favoured an incremental credit that would provide relief only for investment
above a certain level. This would be difficult to design but offered 'more
bang for the buck'.
Mr Bentsen parried all specific questions on taxes, spending and economic
policy with the stock response that Mr Clinton had not yet made final policy
decisions.
In an interview with public television broadcast on Monday evening, Mr
Clinton said his campaign pledge of halving the budget deficit over four
years could be met only by making deeper cuts in public spending than
planned last summer.
'We're going to have to cut more in other places. . . than we would have
thought. . . because the deficit's gotten bigger.' He stopped short,
however, of reaffirming the commitment to halve the deficit.
AP adds: The Democratic-controlled Senate is aiming to complete hearings on
all of Mr Clinton's cabinet nominations in time for them to be voted on by
the Senate shortly after he is inaugurated next Wednesday.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Guatemala reaches deadlock on refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Guatemalan government has refused to guarantee the safety of some 4,000
refugees who are intending to return home this week, thus threatening to
postpone their repatriation and further isolate the government from the
international community, writes Damian Fraser.
The peaceful return of 45,000 refugees is seen as a crucial test of
government willingness to end the 32-year-old civil war. The refugees fled,
mostly to Mexico, early in the 1980s to escape army-backed atrocities.
The government agreed last October to guarantee the safety of the refugees,
and find ways for them to obtain land. But it wants them to return via side
roads near the Peten jungle; the refugees wish to take the Pan-American
highway. Until the dispute is cleared up the government will not guarantee
their safety. Thousands have already left their camps in Mexico, and are
making their way towards the border town of Mesilla. But authorities in
Mexico have not offered them transport while there is no agreement with
Guatemala.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Soros dealing nets big profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York-based financial group headed by Hungarian financier George
Soros turned in a profit of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds
1.9bn) last year, one of his top aides said in London yesterday.
Mr Stan Druckenmiller, a managing director of Soros Fund Management, said
'substantially less than half' the profits came from speculation on
sterling. The rest came from dealing in other currencies and financial
instruments.
He denied that the fund management group - in which Mr Soros has a one-third
stake - had contributed to recent tensions over the French franc by selling
the currency. Last week the franc brushed its floor against the D-Mark
within the European exchange rate mechanism, although this week it has
strengthened.
Last summer the fund management group made about Dollars 1bn from selling
sterling before Britain's ERM exit.
Mr Druckenmiller said it was wrong to think his organisation had
specifically targeted the pound for selling. 'Sterling was one piece in the
matrix (of our overall operations).'
While in London, he met Treasury and Bank of England officials for talks
about currency operations, which one official described as 'helpful'.
Soros Fund Management currently owns a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn.
The total is due to fall over the next few months after profits on last
year's operations are paid to shareholders. Mr Druckenmiller said the franc
was 'not fundamentally overvalued' in the ERM and that Soros Fund Management
'had no plans' to sell it.
'If the ERM did not exist and the franc no longer had a peg to the D-Mark
then in our view the franc would not depreciate,' he said.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Expert scoffs at US fears of long-term decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT the US is in long-term economic decline relative to other nations
are totally unfounded, according to Mr Michael Boskin, outgoing chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers.
'Declinists' have got their facts wrong, Mr Boskin asserts in his annual
Economic Report of the President, released today. Far from
deindustrialising, the US has been gaining ground on other leading
economies.
The report says the US share of the total industrial output of the 24
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states is
higher today than in 1970. US exports have risen from 8 to 11 per cent of
gross domestic product in the past five years, confirming that the US is
'internationally more competitive' than it has been for decades.
The US still has the highest standard of living, as measured by per capita
GDP, and the highest level of industrial productivity, the report says.
Looking forward, Mr Boskin projects a substantial improvement in US
productivity growth.
Output per hour in non-farm businesses will grow at an annual rate of 1.4
per cent between 1990 and 1998, compared with 0.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent
registered in the 1970 and 1980 business cycles, although slower than in the
immediate post-war dec-ades.
The likely increase in productivity growth will reflect a more experienced
labour force as the 'baby boom' generation matures and higher levels of
investment brought about primarily by lower interest rates and inflation.
Mr Boskin concedes, however, that serious problems remain, including the
'deplorable' quality of secondary education, an excessively costly health
care system that fails to insure many Americans, and continuing high levels
of poverty.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US tariff calls upset Japanese car makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's car makers are uneasy over calls by the US motor industry to impose
tariffs on two additional categories of imported vehicles.
The move by the US manufacturers has heightened fears of renewed friction
between the Japanese and US car industries. The Japanese are increasingly
concerned by US car executives lobbying before the presidential inauguration
of Mr Bill Clinton, who is expected by many Japanese executives to take a
tougher stance on bilateral trade.
The big three US car makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are
campaigning to extend a 25 per cent tariff, currently imposed on truck
imports, to multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), such as the Toyota Previa, and to
four-door leisure/utility vehicles.
The US car industry, in the past, has repeatedly complained about the low
level of imports of car parts and cars into Japan. And while Japan has
removed all import tariffs on motor vehicles, and most Japanese car
companies announced distribution tie-ups and joint ventures, frustration
over non-tariff barriers such as closed distribution networks has mounted
within the US industry.
A sharp increase in market share by Japanese imports of the US MPV market
has been the cause of recent friction.

Cries of alarm are coming from the US textile industry, which could get its
tariff protection from the EC reduced by as much as 50 per cent if the
current Gatt talks are successfully completed, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
Asian producers would benefit far more than the Europeans, one textile
representative said. The EC would get tariff breaks on Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds
1.44bn) worth of imports, while suppliers from the Far East would get
reductions on Dollars 3.8bn.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, issued
a statement warning US trading partners that 'the Bush administration may be
negotiating with an eye toward putting a final feather in its cap rather
than working to conclude a sound agreement that will pass Congress'.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Time-out called in Uruguay Round
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TARIFF negotiators from the US and the European Community yesterday broke
off talks in Geneva to seek further instructions from their respective
capitals. 'We have struck a blockage and if our political masters want us to
carry on they need to tell us how to do it,' said an EC official.
The two sides have been trying to strike an outline deal on reducing
barriers to trade in goods by next Friday, when senior negotiators in the
Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalisation meet to review
prospects.
Washington and Brussels agreed to make a final push for a tariff agreement
and the broad framework of a Round settlement before President-elect Bill
Clinton takes office on January 20. But they have run into problems over the
trade-off between US demands for more sectors to be included in a
'zero-for-zero' package, which would eliminate all duties on a reciprocal
basis, and EC demands for cuts in high US tariffs on textiles and other
sensitive products.
Each side argues that the other has not conceded enough. EC officials say
the US has offered only a 10-15 per cent cut in peak textiles tariffs, which
now range up to 36 per cent, reducing the US average from 16.8 per cent to
15.7 per cent. US negotiators say they are prepared to do more if the EC
will go further in reducing or eliminating tariffs in such sectors as
electronic goods and non-ferrous metals.
EC officials said yesterday they expected fresh instructions last night and
talks would continue today 'We're still in business but we need some
guidance,' said one.
Gatt sources said yesterday that a final Uruguay Round deal by Mr Clinton's
inauguration was never on the cards, but that Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
director-general, still hoped for 'something worthwhile' as a stepping stone
to an early overall settlement.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Gatt deal waits on the big guys - EC and
US squabble over barrier reduction while the majority watch for movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YET again the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks is being held
hostage to the resolution of a squabble between the two big trading powers -
the US and the European Community. Negotiators from the other 95 countries
involved in the 108-nation Round can only watch, wait and prod the
protagonists into reaching an accord, this time on reducing barriers to
trade in industrial goods, which will provide the vital framework needed to
complete the complex market access negotiations country by country.
The US and EC have said they want an outline agreement by Friday, in the
hope of presenting President-elect Bill Clinton with a largely 'pre-cooked'
Uruguay Round package by January 20, inauguration day.
The waiting is all the more frustrating when countries know that, if enough
progress towards a transatlantic deal is made within the next few days,
their own vital interests are likely to be traded in a frenetic bargaining
flurry to beat the US administration's 'fast-track' deadline of March 2.
In order to meet that deadline, the entire Uruguay Round package - give or
take some of the less crucial bilateral negotiations over improving market
access for goods and services - would have to be completed early in
February.
This is to allow time for the administration's private sector advisory
groups to submit their assessments to Congress alongside the text of the
Uruguay Round agreement itself. Under fast-track procedures Congress must
approve or reject the agreement without amendment.
It is fair to say that even countries facing immensely difficult political
decisions of their own in the final bargaining sessions are hoping for an
early conclusion to the Round. Even if President Clinton asks for, and gets,
renewed fast-track authority, a further delay could spell death for the
Round as pressure grows for new items to be added and more changes made to
already-negotiated deals.
This is true above all for Japan and South Korea, which are huge
beneficiaries of the open trading system. Both resist any opening of their
closed markets for rice and some other farm commodities, as required by the
draft Uruguay Round 'final act' compiled in December 1991.
But, politically painful as market-opening for rice will undoubtedly be, the
economic pain inflicted by a failure of the Round and the resulting increase
in trade protectionism would be infinitely greater.
The same argument applies to Canada, Switzerland and some other countries
which, like Japan and South Korea, oppose the conversion of all farm import
barriers into tariffs - 'tariffication without exception'. These objections,
trade officials assert, will melt away once the negotiating spotlight is
turned on them.
Since Washington and Brussels settled their farm trade row last November, Mr
Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, has been strenuous in his efforts to persuade countries to propose as
few changes as possible to the draft 'final act'.
He now believes most other nations will not press for amendments of their
own if, in the interests of a quick result, the US can be persuaded to
withdraw most of the 25 or so changes it has demanded. These relate to
issues ranging from anti-dumping to establishment of a new world trade
organisation.
Even if an unravelling of the Uruguay Round text is avoided, however, tough
bargaining lies ahead in bilateral talks on liberalising trade in goods and
services.
Under Gatt's most-favoured-nation rule, tariff cuts and services
liberalisation agreed between the US and EC must be generalised to all Gatt
members. But for most countries the US-EC bargain will not cover all the
products and services which interest them.
Each of these has to be bargained separately, country by country, to produce
the national schedules which will form an integral part of the final Uruguay
Round package. Among the main problem areas:
The US, EC and other trading partners want Japan to make bigger tariff
concessions, for instance on processed food products, wood, non-ferrous
metals and leather. Japan, for its part, wants the EC to cut duties on
electronics goods and the US to cut high tariffs on textiles.
Japan and other Asian countries are under pressure to do more to open up
their markets for services, especially financial services such as banking,
insurance and securities business. Japan wants the US to liberalise its
maritime sector but supports Washington in urging the lifting of EC quotas
on foreign audio-visual services.
Developing countries want big improvements in access to the markets of
industrialised nations for their exports of agricultural goods, raw
materials and textiles. Rich countries, on the other hand, are pushing poor
ones to liberalise their trading regimes faster and to rely less on special
treatment.
It remains an uncomfortable truth, however, that what 'the big guys' do
matters most. Their bilateral tariff deal is not sewn up and the draft
'final act' has not been agreed. The hard bargaining over services is still
to come.

FT  13 JAN 93 / American South puts emphasis on new skills: Barbara Harrison
looks at moves to switch from manufacturing to service industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF INVESTING in people is a central tenet of the incoming Clinton
administration, it will come as no surprise to the American South.
As an Arkansan, the roots of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic
perspective are embedded in the South's experience: a region that, sooner
than the rest of the nation, has bumped up against the barrier to economic
growth that poor skills and low productivity represent.
For many years, cheap labour and low production costs drew American
companies southward from the north-east and Midwest. But, as global
competition has toughened, these lures no longer catch enough fish. The
developing countries have dramatically outbid the US South on labour and
enticed away unskilled manufacturing jobs. 'We cannot compete with low-cost
labour in other parts of the world,' says Mr Moncure Crowder, chief
economist at the Atlanta-based Wachovia Bank.
The prime example of this shift is in the textile and apparel industry,
which, even with modern equipment, is still labour intensive. While textile
and apparel companies continue to lead in manufacturing employment in the
south-east, the industry lost 271,000 jobs between 1970 and 1989, according
to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Many of these jobs went
abroad, and the prospect that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) could bring further erosion of such jobs has many southerners
worried.
The threat is worse given that the region's manufacturing jobs account for
nearly 25 per cent of employment compared to 17 per cent nationally,
according to Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at
Georgia State University.
The region's job base could further be hit by defence spending cuts. The axe
could fall on both the South's many military bases - which during the second
world war gave the region its first big economic impetus - and local defence
industries.
The region's politicians are trying to shift from a manufacturing-based
low-skill economy dependent to a services-based economy more reliant on
knowledge. At the recent annual meeting of the Southern Growth Policies
Board, a regional think-tank, West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton said:
'If you keep doing things the way you're doing them, you'll keep getting
what you've got.'
Although the South has prospered during the Sunbelt boom of the last 20
years, it is still behind in incomes and living standards. In the crescent
of 12 states from West Virginia to Florida and across to Arkansas, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that average per capita income is
only 89 per cent of the national average.
Southerners maintain that there is no mystery why this is so: although
economic and social conditions in the 12 states vary considerably, the
region has higher levels of children in poverty, adult illiteracy and
inadequate public education. In many states, between a third and a half of
first-year university students need remedial education. 'In education, we're
still scraping along the bottom,' says Mr Jeffrey Rosensweig, an economist
who studies the region at Emory University's business school in the Atlanta
area.
On the other hand, the tide of skilled workers from other parts of the US
attracted by the Sunbelt boom has helped fill the labour demands of new and
expanding businesses. For example, in Atlanta, the region's business and
financial capital, an estimated 60 per cent of its 3m people are not native
to the city. And, despite the region's being hit by the 1991 recession, it's
appeal - warm climate, relatively low cost of living, high personal income
growth - persists, particularly along the dynamic Atlantic seaboard.
Foreign investors have felt the pull of the South's low wages and relative
absence of unions. UK, Japanese and German companies have favoured the
region since the 1970s, when the pervasive racism that marred the area
abated. One out of four Americans who worked for foreign-owned companies at
the end of 1990 was in the South, according to the BLS.
Some analysts believe that foreign trade could be the next big impetus for
the region's economy. Mr Wayne Gantt, an Atlanta economic consultant,
believes that, while the Nafta accord could accelerate the demise of the
South's low-cost manufacturing, it will bring many opportunities for
businesses in services, telecommunications, trade and exports.
However, others caution that, if the South does not raise the skill level of
its workforce, these opportunities may go with the wind.

POWER MAKERS, a tiny North Wales-based company set up last summer, has won a

The contract, with a big Pakistan importing company, is the first export
deal for Power Makers. It started selling its all-British fuel catalyst
systems in July after a 2 1/2 -year research and development programme.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Tariffs creeping back in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE way Poland's foreign trade policies are formed and implemented has
become much more transparent since the return of democratic government in
1989. But former lobbying and decision-making patterns have 'survived to the
detriment of efficiency' in state-owned enterprises and banks, according to
a report by the Gatt secretariat.
Economic and political reforms have been accompanied by substantial trade
liberalisation and a reorientation of foreign trade from the former Soviet
trade bloc, Comecon, to western markets, especially in the EC. Since August
1991, however, the Polish authorities, faced with the unexpectedly high
social costs of transition to a market economy and doubts about the
sustainability of reforms, re-introduced protection by eliminating most
tariff suspensions, introducing new duties and widening import licensing.
The government is also considering an import levy system to protect
agriculture, the report says. 'The question must be asked whether the move
towards more protection should be interpreted as long-term or as a temporary
shift to give breathing space for some sectors.'
The report describes the EC association agreement, signed last March, as a
'turning point' which could provide a stable point of orientation in
Poland's 'long and difficult transformation process'. But the impact of the
10-year accord is a matter of concern.
It says liberalisation is slowest or most limited in sectors such as
textiles and clothing, steel and agriculture where Poland seems to have a
comparative advantage. It also notes that, conversely, the agreement means
'EC exporters can easily take advantage of reductions in much higher Polish
tariffs'.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Last year's dealing made Soros group Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York-based financial group headed by Hungarian financier Mr George
Soros turned in a profit of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.3bn and Pounds 1.9bn) last year, one of his top aides said in London
yesterday.
Mr Stan Druckenmiller, a managing director of Soros Fund Management, said
that 'substantially less than half' the profits came from speculation on
sterling.
The rest came from dealing in other currencies and financial instruments.
Mr Druckenmiller denied reports that the fund management group - in which Mr
Soros has a one-third stake - had contributed to recent tensions involving
the French franc by selling the currency. Last week the franc brushed its
floor against the D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism,
although this week it has strengthened.
During last summer's exchange market crisis the fund management group made a
profit of about Dollars 1bn from selling sterling before Britain's ERM exit.
Mr Druckenmiller said it was wrong to think his organisation had
specifically targeted the pound for selling. 'Sterling was one piece in the
matrix (of our overall operations),' he said.
While in London, Mr Druckenmiller met UK Treasury and Bank of England
officials for talks about currency operations, which one UK official
described as 'helpful'.
Soros Fund Management currently owns a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn.
The total is due to fall over the next few months after profits on last
year's operations are paid to shareholders.
Mr Druckenmiller said the franc was 'not fundamentally overvalued' in the
ERM and that Soros Fund Management 'had no plans' to sell the currency.
'If the ERM did not exist and the franc no longer had a peg to the D-Mark
then in our view the franc would not depreciate,' Mr Druckenmiller said.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Delhi crash exposes hazards of pilots' strike: Indian
Airlines has been forced to open negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATURDAY'S crash in Delhi of an Uzbek aircraft leased to Indian Airlines has
forced the domestic carrier into negotiations with its 475 striking pilots.
It has also highlighted the effects on the inefficient, state-owned airline
of the Indian government's open skies policy, under which new private
carriers have been allowed.
The Russian-made Tupolev TU-154, leased from Uzbekistan Airlines because of
the month-long pilots' strike, crashed in fog on Saturday after the Uzbek
pilot apparently failed to understand instructions in English. The aircraft
flipped over, split in pieces and caught fire. In spite of the late arrival
of the emergency services at the scene, all 163 people on board survived
without serious injury. Mr Madhavrao Scindia, minister for civil aviation
and tourism, resigned hours after the crash.
Management and pilots spent yesterday trying to break their impasse. The
pilots want their salaries almost doubled to match those paid by private
carriers, as well as a 200 per cent increase in meal allowances. Officials
say the pilots are already well paid and could soon fly extra hours under a
proposed 'fly more, earn more' scheme.
The strike has benefited the private carriers which have sprung up since the
government's decision 2 1/2 years ago to deregulate national civil aviation,
allowing private operators to choose routes, timings and fares.
India's domestic passengers, accustomed for 40 years to Indian Airlines'
legendary delays, inefficiency and indifferent service, now have the choice
of six other domestic airlines.
The biggest of these, East-West Airlines, has wooed passengers easily by
adhering to schedules and offering good food and courteous service. Extras
such as a free drink - Indian Airlines is not permitted to serve alcohol on
domestic flights - have made it a big hit on Indian Airlines' traditional
high-profit trunk routes such as Bombay-Madras and Delhi-Bombay.
Although it has only three aircraft compared with Indian Airlines' 50, the
Bombay-based airline's success has encouraged at least three more operators
to apply for licences.
With load factors of between 85 and 100 per cent, the fledgling carriers are
already making money, and the strike has only made them more popular.
Continental Airlines, which started operations in October 1991, says its
profits exceeded Rs20m (Pounds 450,000) up to June, and East-West, which
commenced in March, says it hopes to reach Rs20m profits this year.
Indian Airlines, by contrast, has suffered losses for the three years and
says that it is operating at a considerable disadvantage. 'We suddenly find
ourselves operating in a competitive market with our hands tied behind our
backs,' complains a senior airline official.
According to one official, Indian Airlines has operated 'more like a
haphazard patchwork of government departments rather than a commercial
organisation'. It has had social obligations to fly to remote parts of the
vast country, and had rested comfortably on a non-profit making image.
The airline is weighed down by governmental norms. 'We cannot discontinue
services on loss-making sectors any more than we can choose the best
candidate for air-hostesses' jobs, like the private airlines,' says an
Indian Airlines official. 'Nearly 15 per cent of all our routes are
unprofitable.'
Calculations have shown that, on some sectors, flying Indian Airlines is
cheaper than taking a taxi. To keep the airline profitable, Indian Airlines
is forced to increase its capacity utilisation or seat factor as high as 90
per cent on its profitable trunk routes, much higher than the global average
of 68 per cent.
This results in a 'high distress' factor on infrastructure, causing frequent
breakdowns, delays and strained employee relations.
Mr Scindia, while still a minister, admitted that Indian Airlines was at a
disadvantage compared to private airlines. The smaller companies have lower
overheads, hire crew on contract and are not obliged to operate on
unremunerative routes. Indian Airlines, which employs more than 22,000
people, has lost about 50 of its pilots to private operators.
The Indian Commercial Pilot's Association (ICPA), the pilots' union, has
regularly held the Indian Airlines' management to ransom during the peak
tourist season and has disrupted the airline's operations 34 times in the
last three years.
Management has usually given in to pressure from the pilots in order to keep
the airline going. However, this time a hard-headed chairman, Mr
Lakshminarayan Vasudev, backed by Mr Scindia's ministry, decided to hold out
and to operate a skeleton service using foreign pilots and non-union
members. He negotiated the lease of three TU-154s before the strike began
and leased an additional three aircraft before Saturday's crash. All the
TU-154s are now grounded.
The union said the Russian aircraft used twice as much fuel as the Airbus
A-320s they were replacing, and carried fewer passengers. Mr RN Jalan, ICPA
general-secretary, said the pilots' stand had been vindicated by the crash.
The pilots realise that they have little option but to work for India's
largest domestic carrier. For the moment, as stranded passengers crowd
airports and are forced to cancel thousands of trips daily because of a lack
of seats, the pilots seem to have the upper hand.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Arabs urge UN to imposesanctions against lsrael
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB NATIONS meeting in Cairo agreed yesterday to press the UN Security
Council to impose sanctions against Israel for refusing to take back more
than 400 Palestinians expelled to southern Lebanon, but stopped short of
threatening to walk out of the Middle East peace process.
Foreign ministers of the Arab League urged the Security Council to apply the
rules of Chapter 7, which provide for sanctions, because of Israel's refusal
to implement UN Resolution 799. The resolution, passed on December 17,
demands that Israel should return the Palestinians to their homes in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza.
Israel has insisted that it will defy the resolution and is confident that
the US will veto any attempt by the UN to impose sanctions. Mr Richard
Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the US wanted to avoid Chapter
7 being invoked on this issue and believed no further action should be taken
until Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, had exhausted his
efforts to find a solution.
Mr Boutros Ghali is to meet Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, in
Paris today in an attempt to avert sanctions.
Arab nations have been quick to contrast the US attitude towards Israel with
its determination to see that Iraq complies with Security Council
resolutions passed at the end of the Gulf war.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said: 'Most of the Arab
delegates spoke about double standards. Why should Israel be above the law
when other nations are obliged to implement Security Council resolutions? '
The Arab League also warned that Israel's refusal to allow back the
Palestinians posed a serious danger to the Middle East peace process which
opened in Madrid in October 1991. The ninth round of negotiations is
scheduled to begin in Washington on February 20, but the Palestine
Liberation Organisation has warned that it would suspend the participation
of its delegation if the issue of the 400 men was not satisfactorily
resolved.
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria argued that it would be premature to suspend
the talks and believe that Mr Bill Clinton should not be presented with an
Arab ultimatum before he takes over the US presidency.
Little progress was made in the first eight rounds of talks, but with the
Israeli government suffering widespread condemnation for its treatment of
the Palestinian deportees there is some hope among Arab officials that it
will return to the table with more positive proposals.
Lebanon yesterday repeated its refusal to take the men.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Patten softens over constitutional plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Chris Patten of Hong Kong yesterday urged local politicians to
approve plans for the colony's political development that were acceptable to
both Britain and China.
At a special question and answer session of the Legislative Council (LegCo)
the governor said the administration would present its proposals for the
conduct of elections due next year and in 1995 towards the end of next
month.
But in a statement which was seen as inviting compromise, Mr Patten said he
hoped LegCo would 'agree to proposals which are acceptable to the community
and which are acceptable to both the present and future sovereign powers'.
The governor's remarks mark a further softening in his stance on Hong Kong's
constitutional development. Over the past month Mr Patten has stopped saying
that any alternatives to his plans had to be better than his. He has
emphasised that what he suggested last October were simply 'proposals' and
has encouraged LegCo members and others to come up with alternatives.
However, Mr Patten has stood fast in rejecting calls by China to withdraw
his proposals unilaterally. China has said it will not talk to Mr Patten
until his proposals are withdrawn and it has threatened to repudiate any
legislation LegCo enacts if it is not first consulted by Britain.
Since New Year, Beijing too has moderated its stance on honouring contracts
which span the change in sovereignty in 1997.
The governor's Executive Council will study his plans for the next month and
it seems unlikely that they will reach LegCo before the end of February.
LegCo is not expected to vote until the early summer.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Cricket tour to continue despite Bombay violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT of the Indian Cricket Board insisted yesterday that the tour
by the England team would not be called off despite violence in Bombay and
other parts of western India.
The first one-day international, due to have been played in Ahmedabad on
Saturday, has been cancelled but Indian officials argue that it was just bad
luck that the six-match series was scheduled to start there. They believe
that the area will be quiet by February 19 when the last of the three Test
matches is due to start in Bombay.
The growth of international broadcasting and the accompanying sponsorship
and advertising revenues has made cricket tours of India lucrative. British
Sky Broadcasting, the UK satellite television company, is to broadcast all
the international matches.
One Indian cricket journalist estimated that revenue would pass Dollars 1m
(Pounds 650,000) - from television rights, team and match sponsorship -
before a ticket was sold.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Bush finds Saddam as elusive as ever: Iraqi provocations
have so far failed to push the UN into retaliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration has often found reading the mind of Mr Saddam
Hussein to be a frustrating exercise; in its final days before handing over
to President-elect Bill Clinton the task is proving no easier.
In a series of provocative actions - harassment of United Nations relief
workers in the Kurdish protective zone of northern Iraq, violations of the
southern no-fly zone, obstruction of UN weapons inspectors, incursions into
the demilitarised zone along the newly demarcated Iraq-Kuwait border - Iraq
has sought to test the resolve of the US and its coalition allies, as it
prepares for a change of leadership.
The response to these separate but related incidents has been firm but
uneven, and a gap may now be emerging between the US, backed by the UK, and
the rest of the UN Security Council over whether Iraq has overstepped the
line.
All reports from Washington suggest that President George Bush is fed up
with Mr Saddam's provocations and ready to order a military riposte. At the
UN in New York, Iraq's continued defiance appears to have engendered more
frustration than anger.
Wholesale Iraqi disruption of the aid operation in Kurdistan drew little
more than mutterings while warnings to Iraq about incursions across the
Kuwaiti border have not been backed up by any display of force.
But violations of the two no-fly zones have been met swiftly: an Iraqi MiG
aircraft which ventured into the southern zone a fortnight ago was shot down
immediately, and threatening Iraqi missile movements were met with a 48-hour
ultimatum.
'The real distinction is that challenges in the no-fly zone threatened the
lives of allied pilots,' said Ms Laurie Mylroie, an analyst at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
US officials argue they have already established both the legal authority to
deal with violations of the no-fly zones, which are operated under UN
resolution 688, and the operational framework, because all military options
have been worked out to confront a long list of Iraqi violations over the
last 18 months.
'If the determination is made that enforcement of the UN resolution needs to
be undertaken, it will be without warning,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White
House spokesman.
The demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border is more recent, so less case
history has been established. Operationally, the area also falls under the
direct supervision of the UN's observer mission, rather than of the allied
military command in the region.
However, the US has sought to link the various incidents together, and on
Monday night the adoption by the UN Security Council of a statement warning
Iraq of 'grave consequences' was delayed by a last-minute American move to
add an introductory paragraph to the text agreed in day-long consultations.
This paragraph stressed that the Iraqis' seizure of weapons, including
missiles, at their former naval base at Umm Qasr, which now lies partly in
Kuwait was part of a pattern of defiance.
At US insistence, the council statement also cited a series of border
incidents involving the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (Unikom) which
maintains a staff at Umm Qasr, and Iraq's banning of 70 UN weapons
inspectors from entering the country in a non-Iraqi charter aircraft.
Baghdad's proposal that the UN use Iraqi Airways or a land route from Jordan
violates the Gulf ceasefire resolution.
Iraq clearly found the Security Council warning less than compelling since
yesterday it defiantly compounded its offence by conducting another
unauthorised expedition to the Umm Qasr base.
Some US officials see Iraqi defiance as an encouraging sign of Mr Saddam's
need to bolster his domestic position because of the damaging effect of the
UN embargo.
US intelligence suggests that food shortages have worsened considerably in
recent months since Jordan began to enforce the embargo more assiduously,
helped by Mr Saddam's own measures to ban certain imports.
Other Middle East analysts, however, say that at his weakest, Mr Saddam did
not allow demonstrations in Baghdad, for fear that a notionally
pro-government crowd might turn against him; he now appears confident enough
to allow demonstrations.
But if the US may perhaps be misreading Mr Saddam's domestic strength, it is
possible the Iraqi leader is misreading Mr Bush's position: he may tweak Mr
Bush into action in his last week in power, or he may provoke Mr Clinton
into a show of strength at the start of his presidency.
Mr Saddam may also be misreading the cohesion of the international coalition
that faces him. Some of the Arab countries involved in the Gulf War are now
less public in their opposition to Iraq, but although Turkey rumbles
occasionally, it continues to support the Provide Comfort relief operation
in Kurdistan.
And Russia has now joined the US, the UK and France tocreate a 'Permanent
Four' that excludes only China among the permanent members of the Security
Council.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Suharto puts Miyazawa on the spot

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday placed Japan in an embarrassing
position when he reiterated his desire to attend the meeting of the Group of
Seven industrialised countries in Tokyo in July.
Relations between the two countries are close, with Indonesia being the
largest recipient of Japanese aid, but the request would require consensus
approval by the G7, which would be unlikely.
Mr Suharto is chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which groups more
than 100, mostly developing, nations. He has called for a restructuring of
debt for the poorest countries and greater access to the markets of
developed nations.
After meeting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister in Jakarta as
part of a four-nation tour of South-East Asia, a Japanese spokesman said
Japan would consult its G7 partners. 'It is not an easy thing to try to
achieve consensus among the G7,' he warned.
Diplomats say the Indonesian government regards the attendance, even if in
the margins, of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a G7 summit last year
as setting a precedent to allow non-member countries to participate. But a
G7 diplomat yesterday noted 'Russia was an immediate and very pressing
issue, while ordinarily the G7 would not discuss north-south matters. It is
not what the G7 does. It's not the way aid is administered.'
Indonesia may, however, take the issue as a test of Mr Miyazawa's foreign
policy initiative of promoting regional co-operation.
As chairman of NAM, Indonesia does have some leverage over Japan. Both
countries agree on the need to restructure the United Nations and expand the
Security Council.
Diplomats say that Japan is keen to become a permanent member of an expanded
Security Council but would need the votes of non-aligned member countries to
secure a seat.

<TEXT>
CHINA'S growing role in business in Hong Kong was yesterday underlined when
the colonial administration announced that Bank of China would become the
colony's third note issuing bank from May next year.
The decision to allow Bank of China to issue paper currency was taken
yesterday by Governor Chris Patten in a meeting with his Executive Council.
Bank of China is Hong Kong's second largest banking group. It oversees the
activities of 13 mainland banks operating in Hong Kong. It has been expected
for some time that it would gain approval to issue notes.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Standard Chartered are at present the two
note issuers in Hong Kong. Hongkong Bank has the largest share of
circulation with more than 80 per cent
Bank of China plans to issue initially HKDollars 6bn of paper currency,
equal to about 10 per cent of the current notes in circulation The Hong Kong
government will have to approve its bank note design.
Enabling legislation and logistical and administrative measures, Bank of
China needs to institute means May next year is the earliest it can issue
notes.
The Hong Kong government yesterday said it had decided not to introduce a
'deposit protection scheme' for bank depositors. The government does plan to
introduce legislation which gives priority to small depositors in the case
of bank failure. In the wake of Bank of Credit and Commerce's collapse in
1991, the government came under pressure to legislate for deposit
protection. A period of public consultation found little support for the
idea.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA is facing a slowdown in investment as new opportunities open in
China and elsewhere in the Asia region.
According to the government, proposed foreign and domestic capital
investments in the manufacturing sector last year fell by nearly 30 per cent
to MDollars 22.4bn (Pounds 5.65bn).
Total foreign investment approvals in 1992 increased by 2 per cent, with the
US, Australia and France making sizeable increases in capital outlay, but
these investments related to a small number of petrochemical projects.
Other foreign investment showed a steep decline. Investments by Taiwan, at
one stage Malaysia's biggest foreign investor, fell from MDollars 3.6bn in
1991 to MDollars 1.5bn in 1992. Meanwhile Taiwan's investments in China have
been surging.
Vietnam is also believed to be attracting investment funds away from
Malaysia and other countries in South-East Asia. Japan's investments in
Malaysia declined last year by 30 per cent to MDollars 2.6bn.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the minister of trade and industry, said Malaysia
continued to attract sizeable foreign investments but she admitted that the
government was concerned over the decline in domestic investment which, in
terms of projects approved, had fallen by 33 per cent last year to MDollars
9.6bn.

<TEXT>
MR Lal Krishan Advani, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
party (BJP), yesterday demanded immediate elections in India, claiming that
the government had lost the mandate of the people as violence in Bombay, the
country's commercial capital, continued for the ninth day running.
Fourteen more people were killed yesterday, raising the death toll in the
latest round of violence in the city to 200.
Life in Bombay continued to be paralysed, as troops marched through deserted
suburban streets, unable to contain the looting and burning.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister who has been directing the security
clampdown, said he expected the city to return to normal by today.
The radical BJP plans to intensify its campaign for early elections by
despatching leaders throughout the country after announcing its programme on
January 15.
Mr Advani said he was 'not ashamed' of the demolition of the mosque in
Ayodhya by Hindu fundamentalists - the incident that sparked the communal
violence - saying it was a 'dilapidated and abandoned' structure and not a
mosque at all.
The Congress (I) yesterday ruled out the possibility of a change of
leadership in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the states worst hit in the second
phase of violence following the destruction of the mosque.
Mr VN Gadgil, the party's spokesman, said there was no question of the
government declaring a partial emergency.

MR Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebel movement was yesterday massing troops near
four Angolan cities to counter-attack a government offensive, diplomats
said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
A government communique said Mr Savimbi had fled his headquarters in Huambo
for an unknown destination. Angolan state radio said Mr Savimbi was in
Zaire. But the rebel leader told Portugal's TSF radio he was still in
Huambo.
He offered to meet Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Geneva for
talks as suggested by UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali.
The government communique said Unita forces were grouping near the coastal
cities of Lubito and Benguela and the provincial capitals of Lubango and
Cuito in central and southern Angola.
A western diplomat said Unita's aim now was to launch counter-attacks
against government troops after its forces were forced to withdraw from
Huambo.
He said Unita was also massing around Huambo, despite Mr Savimbi's
declaration it was still in Unita hands, and Luena, capital of the western
province of Moxico.
There was considerable confusion over events in central and southern Angola,
with each side contradicting the other in reports of fighting.
Angolan rebels have destroyed five oil wells owned by Fina Oil, Angola's
state-run radio said in a report monitored by the BBC.

The proposed measures, presented to parliament yesterday, will produce total

FT  13 JAN 93 / French inflation rate falls to 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S inflation rate fell to 2 per cent last year, the lowest rate of
price increase for 36 years, and well below the forecasts made by the
government.
Insee, the state statistics agency, said yesterday the improvement, which
compares with inflation of 3.1 per cent in 1991, leaves the French rate 1.8
percentage points below Germany's. This is the biggest inflation rate
advantage over Germany since the 1940s and leaves France with one of the
lowest inflation rates of countries in the European monetary system. This
will reinforce the French government's view that there is no economic reason
to devalue the franc against the D-Mark.
Prices were stable in December for the second month running, as a fall in
food and oil prices was wiped out by higher costs in other sectors.
Economic analysts yesterday predicted that monthly inflation would pick up
again to stabilise at around 2 per cent a year for the rest of this year.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said hourly wages grew by 1.5 per cent in
real terms last year, thanks to low consumer price inflation, representing
the biggest rise in purchasing power since 1982. Including bonuses, real
wages grew by 3.5 per cent last year.
Earlier, the government confirmed that rising unemployment payments and
falling tax revenues would cost an additional FFr20bn (Pounds 2.43bn) in the
social security budget. This brings to FFr36bn the amount of extra budget
spending announced, increasing the likelihood that France will overshoot its
FFr165bn budget deficit target for 1993.
Paribas, the French investment bank, forecasts a conservative FFr270bn
deficit this year, equivalent to 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product,
while Mr Edouard Balladur, former RPR finance minister who has emerged as
the Gaulists' leading policy spokesman, fears it could rise above FFr300bn.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK's minority government yesterday laid plans to prevent its possible
downfall over the 'Tamilgate' affair, the scandal alleged to involve
deliberate delays in granting entry visas to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka.
Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister, held the first cabinet meeting of the new
year to discuss the likely fall-out from a 6,000-page judicial report to be
published tomorrow.
The report investigates charges that Mr Schluter knowingly misled parliament
over the visa restrictions which legal experts argue were introduced in 1987
in breach of Denmark's liberal immigration law.
A damning report could seal the fate of Mr Schluter's conservative liberal
coalition, which has held power for 10 years, and prompt an early general
election, an embarrassment for Denmark, which holds the EC presidency.
An election campaign could also complicate plans for a second referendum on
the Maastricht treaty, which Mr Schluter said yesterday could be held on
April 27.
But Danish officials and politicians yesterday insisted a switch of
government would not harm prospects for Maastricht since seven out of
Denmark's eight parties now supported the treaty under a special deal agreed
at the Edinburgh summit last month.
Mr Helvig Pedersen, leader of the Radical Liberals, who hold the swing
position in parliament, said one reason voters rejected Maastricht last June
was their concern about losing Danish citizenship in a European political
union. 'We are a homogeneous population with almost the same race and the
same religion. We are not used to black people coming in,' he declared.
In the past, most immigrants in Denmark came from Scandinavia, Germany and
the UK, but the collapse of the Soviet empire and the Yugoslav civil war has
raised migrant pressures on Denmark's 5m population. Last year, 15,000
asylum seekers came to Denmark, including 9,000 from Yugoslavia.
As in Germany, Danish politicians are considering tighter laws on asylum
seekers. Visas are required for people coming from Serbia, but broader
controls are provoking opposition from the Liberal and Social Democratic
parties.
One option is to introduce 'temporary refugee status', offering shelter
without incurring the obligation of taking in relatives of refugees. This
would probably have prevented the 'Tamilgate' scandal which turns on whether
the then justice minister broke the law by denying Tamil refugees the right
to bring their close relatives to Denmark.
Iceland voted narrowly yesterday to join the European Economic Area (EEA),
closing the longest debate ever in the world's oldest parliament, Reuter
reports from Reykjavik.
After bitter arguments over sovereignty, the Althing accepted the agreement
reached between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
Voting was 33 in favour and 23 against with seven abstentions.

IRELAND'S new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government, which formally took
office last night, will tackle the crisis facing the punt at its first
cabinet meeting today.
Mr Albert Reynolds, who has been re-elected prime minister by parliament,
said in announcing his new cabinet that the coalition was committed to
defending the existing parity of the punt within the ERM 'and we are ready
to implement the domestic policies necessary to underpin (this)'.
'We are looking to our European partners for assistance in fighting off the
currency speculators. The future of the EMS itself and economic and monetary
union is at stake if countries can be successfully picked off one by one,'
Mr Reynolds said.
The Labour party has been allocated six of the 15 cabinet posts, with its
party leader Mr Dick Spring being given the posts of deputy prime minister
and foreign minister. It also has been given the big-spending Health and
Education ministries and a new Ministry of Enterprise and Employment, which
will replace the existing Industry Ministry.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the outgoing finance minister, has retained his portfolio.
Interest rates in the Dublin inter-bank money market continued their
roller-coaster ride yesterday, falling sharply as the central bank dropped
its overnight lending rate from 100 per cent to 30 per cent.
It also offered limited amounts of one-month funds on tender to the clearing
banks at 14 per cent in an effort to improve liquidity in the market and
head off commercial interest rate rises.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Rover faces EC fine over discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER may be fined by the European Commission for restricting the discounts
some of its dealers could offer customers in 1989 and 1990.
The British car maker has offered to pay compensation.
The restriction breaches EC competition policy and could lead to prosecution
under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.
However, the Commission said yesterday no formal charges had yet been
brought against Rover over the discount restrictions. It therefore dismissed
suggestions that Rover could be facing a fine of Pounds 2.5m and a bill for
compensation of up to Pounds 65m.
The British Aerospace subsidiary is already involved in a dispute with the
Commission, which wants repayment of Pounds 44.4m government aid granted to
BAe when it bought Rover in 1988.
Rover Group refused to comment on the discounts issue yesterday. But it does
not dispute that the restrictions occurred. It has offered compensation of
Pounds 500,000 but this so far has proved unacceptable to the Commission.
The Commission acknowledges that Rover itself brought the matter to
Brussels' attention in 1990.
Whether the Commission does decide to institute proceedings is expected to
depend on the outcome of discussions over compensation. The Commission
cannot compel Rover to pay compensation, but an offer from the company which
it regarded as inadequate could have a bearing on the size of any fine it
might impose.
Any decision on proceedings will be in the hands of Mr Karel Van Miert, the
new competition commissioner.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Russian minister attacks price curbs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Fyodorov, Russia's new deputy prime minister for economics and
finance, was yesterday trying to persuade Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to
reverse controversial price curbs which he described as impracticable and
politically inappropriate.
Mr Fyodorov, in Washington when the curbs were adopted last week, said he
believed Mr Chernomyrdin had been 'misled' by other advisers in taking a
decision 'contrary to market reform'. The government ordered enterprises to
restrict their profit margins to 10-25 per cent, widening the scope of
existing restrictions.
'Economically speaking, it is not possible to implement. . . from the
political point of view, it is just wrong,' Mr Fyodorov said in Moscow. 'We
will fight to neutralise it or repeal it for good.' He was later due to meet
Mr Chernomyrdin. Mr Fyodorov, 35, revealed he would propose measures next
week for 'further reform, make the rouble stronger, and stabilise the
situation'. This would include a sharp rise in interest rates, measures to
try to stop the rouble being spurned in favour of the dollar as a means of
payment within Russia, and promote a bond market to help finance the budget
deficit.
He would also propose creation of escrow accounts in Russian-owned banks
abroad, such as Moscow Narodny in London. These would hold a portion of
profits from Russian enterprises in hard currency, giving foreign investors
the guarantees they sought, while enabling the Russian authorities to
monitor the flow of capital in and out of Russia.
Asked if he was intruding into areas previously managed by the central bank,
he claimed the central bank was failing to defend the national currency.
'The central bank cannot operate in a vacuum. The government has a certain
priority. If the central bank were fulfilling its function, we would not
worry. But if it is not, then I have to worry,' he said, promising to take
his case to the public if necessary. 'If the rouble rate falls and inflation
increases, people should know it is because the central bank is not
performing its role.'
'I believe that without a strong rouble it is not possible to stop a fall in
production and living standards.' He was against the indexation of
enterprises' working capital carried out until now by the central bank and
finance ministry.
Money should instead be spent on social security payments for those in need
or who stood to lose their jobs as enterprises closed. He wanted to ensure
the central bank 'did not interfere' in areas such as industrial production,
which it has sought to prop up by providing cheap credit for struggling
state enterprises.

The depth of the slowdown in the Italian economy was underlined yesterday
with figures showing that gross domestic product declined 0.6 per cent in
the third quarter of 1992, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The quarterly
figure means GDP was growing at an annual 0.8 per cent to the end of
September. This is the lowest annual growth rate in a decade, although the
economy has slowed each year since 1989. The government had projected zero
growth in the third quarter and expected GDP to grow by more than 1 per cent
over the year. The main cause for the sharper drop in growth was the
slowdown in the industrial sector. The only positive note in the
third-quarter figures was a 4 per cent increase in exports.

FT  13 JAN 93 / NedCar to axe 1,200 jobs

   ABOUT 1,200 jobs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
nearly one quarter of the work force - are to go by the end of this year at
NedCar, the Dutch car maker owned jointly by Volvo, Mitsubishi of Japan and
the Dutch government.
The job cuts form part of a company restructuring, both to combat dwindling
sales of its current Volvo 400 models and to prepare for production of joint
Volvo/Mitsubishi models from the mid-1990s. NedCar makes about 100,000 cars
a year.
The company told unions yesterday the measures were 'essential if the
continuity of NedCar was not to be seriously jeopardised'.
About 800 job losses will be compulsory.
NedCar's management said a drop in European car demand, increased
competition and adverse currency shifts had made 'far-reaching economies'
necessary.
Vehicle production is to be concentrated at the group's main manufacturing
facility at Born.
The company's engineering and development would be shared between Born and
the company's administrative headquarters at Helmond.
In an attempt to increase revenue, NedCar is exploring the possibility of
selling its research and development skills to outside companies.
The Dutch government had held a 70 per cent stake in NedCar up to end 1991,
when Mitsubishi was invited to take a 33 per cent stake.
The government is committed to selling its remaining one-third stake by 1998
equally to Volvo and Mit-subishi.
The new car range to replace the 400 will be badged both as Volvos and
Mitsubishis but are to be mainly engineered by Mitsubishi.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Sapin gives warning to speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, yesterday warned speculators
they would be making a 'big mistake' if they thought France's monetary
policy would change in the coming months.
At a dinner of the Group of Seven Council, a private think-tank that brings
together policymakers from the industrial countries, Mr Sapin said
Franco-German co-operation in defence of the franc was unflinching and
operating under the best of conditions.
He said the monetary authorities of both countries had reaffirmed their
support for the franc-Mark parity. 'I can assure you they will take other
measures should it prove necessary,' he said.' Franco-German co-operation is
very close, it will grow deeper in the coming period; you will soon once
again see some tangible signs of it.'
Mr Sapin said that maintaining the franc's stability did not mean the
government would not support economic activity. He pointed out that France
had deliberately accepted an increase in its budgetary deficit to sustain
the economy and had taken several measures, such as tax relief for
companies, to help activity.
'We shall keep up that policy of selective support for a given sector, but
in the framework of a global strategy we set for ourselves,' he said.
He underlined that the strong franc policy enjoyed wide support in France
and had drawn backing from 'all the major political figures in our country'.
Mr Sapin, however, acknowledged that France was facing problems. Interest
rates were 'too high' and the unemployment level was of concern.
He said the European monetary system was not perfect. But this was why the
European Community had to move on quickly towards a single currency and
economic and monetary union.

MR Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist leader, was last night
on the point of being released from prison after the Berlin constitutional
court ruled he was too sick to stand trial.
Mr Honecker has been charged with responsibility for the fatal shooting of
13 East German refugees trying to escape to the west across the Berlin Wall.
The move is likely to end a case originally billed as the most sensational
political trial since Nazi war criminals were tried at Nuremberg.
It will allow the former East German dictator to emigrate to Chile to join
his wife and daughter, and it is unlikely the government will stop him
going. He is expected to die of liver cancer within a matter of months.

FT  13 JAN 93 / New Irish cabinet to tackle punt crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government, which formally took
office last night, is likely to tackle the crisis facing the punt at its
first cabinet meeting today.
Interest rates in the Dublin inter-bank money market continued their
roller-coaster ride yesterday, falling sharply as the central bank dropped
its overnight lending rate from 100 to 30 per cent. It also offered limited
amounts of one-month funds on tender to the clearing banks at 14 per cent in
an effort to improve liquidity in the market and head off commercial
interest rate rises.
The punt traded above its ERM floor yesterday.
However, the fall in money market interest rates appears unlikely to avert a
threatened increase of 3 percentage points in mortgage rates later this week
by the main Irish building societies.
Mr Michael Torpey, treasurer at the Irish Permanent Building Society, said:
'We will need a substantial cut in wholesale money market rates if we are to
hold off a rise in mortgage rates. We are now assessing the situation on a
day-by-day basis.'
In the inter-bank market, one-month rates fell from 60 to 40 per cent
yesterday. Mr Mike Lennon, the head of treasury and funding at the EBS
building society in Dublin, said the one-month rate would have to fall to
between 15 and 20 per cent 'and have a prospect of remaining there', if the
mortgage rate rise was to be avoided.
A rise of 3 percentage points in mortgage rates to 17 per cent, while price
inflation is projected to be less than 2 per cent this year, would be a blow
to the new coalition in its first week in office, and could undermine its
stated resolve to maintain the punt at its present parity within the ERM.
Interest rate management has become the central bank's main weapon in
defending the punt since exchange controls were lifted on January 1.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Fianna Fail party leader, was formally re-elected as
prime minister by parliament yesterday, with the support of the Labour
party's 33 deputies, thereby sealing the new coalition pact. Labour is to be
allocated six of the 15 posts in the cabinet.
Mr Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, will take charge at the Foreign
Ministry.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the outgoing finance minister, is widely expected to retain
his portfolio.

FT  13 JAN 93 / The world tries to end horror of poison gas: More than 100
nations have agreed to sign, but the ban on chemical weapons could go
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 90 years of efforts to eradicate poison gases as instruments of
war culminate in a treaty being signed in Paris over the next three days.
The first signatures will be put this afternoon to a convention outlawing
the use, manufacture, storage and transfer of chemical arms.
Under the Chemical Weapons Convention stockpiles and production facilities
will be destroyed, and procedures set up to verify compliance and monitor
production of chemicals that could potentially be used for weapons.
By Friday it is expected that foreign ministers or their representatives
from well over 100 countries will have signed.
But the high profile given to the occasion cannot disguise the treaty's
compromise nature. Officials in the UK, which sought tougher policing of the
ban, admitted it would not provide a final answer to proliferation of
chemical weapons. 'There are no final answers in this business,' they added.
It will be at least 10 years before the world gets rid of stockpiles
reckoned to include about 5m chemical munitions, and the convention will
leave important gaps, at least initially. Most Arab governments are expected
to boycott the Paris ceremony. Egypt, hosting an Arab League meeting on
Monday, said there was a unanimous decision not to sign. It and other Arab
nations have made their assent conditional on Israel's joining the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty; chemical weapons are seen as providing a
counterweight to Israeli nuclear weapons.
The US and other western governments hope Arab countries will eventually
join. But this may have to await the outcome of the Middle East peace
process.
North Korea, another suspected possessor of chemical arms, is also expected
to stay out of the treaty.
The watering-down of verification rules is seen as another weakness. In
1984, then US Vice-President George Bush proposed a draft treaty subject to
inspection 'any time, anywhere'. But in the later stages of negotiation the
US took a very different stance, worried that the treaty might be used to
pry into other secret military installations. The final text allows a
country up to five days to negotiate terms before opening a site to
inspectors.
The treaty will not take effect until early 1995, assuming that at least 65
countries have ratified it by the middle of next year.
However, western officials believe it will create a significant impediment
to would-be proliferators. It will reinforce the controls which
industrialised countries in the so-called Australia Group have been
exercising over chemical exports, and provides for the destruction of all
declared production facilities - including, most importantly, Russia's.
The US and the then Soviet Union agreed in 1990 to stop making chemical
weapons and scrap most of their holdings. The US is now discussing
assistance to help Russia with the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) cost of
destroying its 40,000-tonne stockpile.
A number of countries alleged to possess chemical weapons are expected to
join the treaty. These include Iran, Israel, China, India and Pakistan.
The treaty caps 24 years of negotiation on a global ban, undertaken for the
last 12 of those years in an ad hoc committee of the UN's 39-nation
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The impetus for concluding this
notoriously tedious process came from the ending of the cold war, the
flagrant use of chemicals during the Iran-Iraq war and the threatened use by
Iraq in the 1991 Gulf conflict. Although Iraq will not be a signatory,
destruction and inspection of its extensive facilities is being undertaken
separately under UN resolutions.
Early last year the talks appeared in danger of losing momentum if not
completed quickly. Working from an Australian draft, negotiations were
declared closed in August. A subsequent resolution supporting the treaty at
the UN General Assembly was co-sponsored by 144 nations.
It has taken the international community 67 years to extend the ban on the
use of chemical weapons - the Geneva Protocol - to outlawing the weapons
themselves. The only precedent for an outright ban of this kind is the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention, but that failed to provide for verification.
Verification, including challenge inspections without right of refusal,
brought up the greatest problems in the talks, and occupies much of the
192-page document. Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, argues that it is 'the most intrusive inspection regime
ever established in an arms control agreement'. UK officials say that
despite the compromises it should deter 'all but the most determined
evaders'.
An Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is to be set up in
The Hague to oversee compliance. Each signatory will also have to set up an
authority to deal with chemical producers and incoming inspections. Dr Tamar
Posner, an expert at the UK Chemical Industries Association, estimates that
preparation and training for inspections could cost producers Pounds 90,000
per inspection.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Dutch announce Pounds 5bn defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Netherlands is to abolish conscription by 1998 and cut its armed forces
by nearly 45 per cent over the next seven years, as part of wide-ranging
measures to adapt its security apparatus to the end of the cold war and the
growth in peacekeeping operations.
The proposed measures, presented to parliament yesterday, will produce total
spending cuts on defence of around Fl 14bn (Pounds 5bn) between 1994 and
2003 and will involve the closure of many military barracks across the
Netherlands.
The proposals, to be debated by parliament in March, go significantly
further than a government white paper in early 1992 which had called for a
30 per cent reduction in the Dutch armed forces.
Under the Defence Ministry's 'priorities review' paper, the Netherlands'
combined armed forces will drop to 70,000 personnel around the turn of the
century, from more than 125,000 at present, with the army scheduled to face
the biggest cuts because of the move to an all-volunteer force on January 1
1988. The Netherlands now has 48,000 conscripts who each serve 12 months.
Mr Relus Ter Beek, defence minister, said the sweeping cuts had been agreed
with the Netherlands' Nato partners. The Netherlands would remain prepared
for large-scale conflict but its armed forces would concentrate mainly on
readiness to handle crisis management, along with humanitarian and
peacekeeping operations.
If a serious conflict blew up the Netherlands would be able to swell its
70,000-strong forces to about 110,000 by calling up reserve personnel.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Italy to press on with state sell-offs: Minister pledges
move to join mainstream of competitive countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY will join the mainstream of competitive European countries with its
planned privatisation of a large swathe of state-owned industry, Mr Piero
Barucci, treasury minister, predicted yesterday.
Launching a presentation of prime companies to be sold to private
shareholders, he told London bankers that privatisation would curb the
'anomaly' of the undue size of Italy's public sector. 'The path we are
following is full of problems. There will be a lot of dissent. But the
government doesn't have any alternative.'
Yesterday's one-day conference was the first full-scale presentation to
foreign investors of the disposal programme formulated by the government of
Mr Giuliano Amato. A line-up of heavyweight Italian government and corporate
representatives attracted an audience of about 500.
Mr Barucci stressed the government would approach the problem pragmatically,
learning from other countries' experience in dismantling the public sector,
above all the UK and France.
But yesterday's session failed to clear up some important details about the
privatisation programme.
Mr Barucci confirmed that the government would sell off 51 per cent or more
of some state groups. He also announced that a package of incentives to
increase private investors' interest in share flotations, delayed at the end
of last year, would be passed by ministers on Friday.
But he could not dispel doubts over whether Italy's relatively thin stock
market will prove adequate to cope with the large amounts of equity likely
to be sold in coming years. 'The great question is how to encourage retail
buying of shares in a country which relies on large private purchases of
bonds to finance the budget deficit,' one banker at the conference said.
The government plans to raise L7,000bn (Pounds 3bn) in privatisation
revenues this year, followed by L10,000bn each in 1994 and 1995.
Mr Barucci refused to countenance having to lower this target if Italian
economic sluggishness persisted.
Asked whether Italy might face deflation if it tried to cut its budget
deficit in line with the Maastricht economic performance targets, Mr Barucci
said anyone who predicted such a 'desperate' outcome should fly to the moon.
'You must be optimistic. This is the only way.'
Mr Franco Bernabe, managing director of ENI, the state oil and petrochemical
concern, admitted that the recession was a 'large problem' for efforts to
privatise groups hit by lack of demand. But he said hidden reserves in ENI's
balance sheet of an estimated Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn (Pounds 6.5bn-Pounds
9.7bn) represented a powerful attraction for investors.
There was also some confusion about possible safeguards to prevent foreign
shareholders building up controlling interests in strategically important
Italian companies.
Mr Bernabe said Italy would bring in a 'softer version' of the so-called
'golden share', designed to pre-empt control of certain companies by foreign
shareholders.
But Mr Michele Tedeschi, managing director of the industrial and banking
holding group IRI, said there would be 'no prejudice' against foreign
investors.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Rover faces EC fine over discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER may be fined by the European Commission for restricting the discounts
some of its dealers could offer customers in 1989 and 1990.
The British car maker has offered to pay compensation.
The restriction breaches EC competition policy and could lead to prosecution
under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.
However, the Commission said yesterday no formal charges had yet been
brought against Rover over the discount restrictions. It therefore dismissed
suggestions that Rover could be facing a fine of Pounds 2.5m and a bill for
compensation of up to Pounds 65m.
The British Aerospace subsidiary is already involved in another dispute with
the Commission, which wants repayment of Pounds 44.4m government aid granted
to BAe when it bought Rover in 1988.
Rover Group refused to comment on the discounts issue yesterday. But it does
not dispute that the restrictions occurred. It has offered compensation of
Pounds 500,000 but this so far has proved unacceptable to the Commission.
Rover's case is that the restrictions were imposed between late 1989 and
early 1990 by several UK regional offices which were unaware they breached
EC rules; that they were imposed without the knowledge of Rover's board;
that they affected relatively few transactions; and that they were stopped
as soon as the board became aware of them.
The Commission acknowl-edges that Rover itself brought the matter to
Brussels' attention in 1990.
Whether the Commission does decide to institute proceedings is expected to
depend on the outcome of discussions over compensation.
The Commission cannot compel Rover to pay compensation, but an offer from
the car company which it regarded as inadequate could have a strong bearing
on the size of any fine it might impose.
Any decision on proceedings will be in the hands of Mr Karel Van Miert, Sir
Leon Brittan's successor as competition commissioner.
Mr Van Miert will also decide when and if there is to be further EC action
to make BAe repay the Pounds 44.4m government 'sweeteners' for BAe to take
over Rover in 1988.

FT  13 JAN 93 / PM rejects statutory controls on press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR statutory controls on the press were rejected by Mr John Major
yesterday amid disclosures that at least one member of the Royal family had
sanctioned leaks about their personal life to tabloid newspapers.
Downing Street officials said the prime minister would not support the
creation of a tribunal with legal authority to impose sanctions against
newspapers judged to have breached strict new privacy rules.
His stance was revealed as ministers tacitly confirmed reports that the
Princess of Wales had played a behind-the-scenes role in press coverage last
year of the break-up of her marriage to Prince Charles. There was no
confirmation that Prince Charles had done likewise.
The disclosures were judged at Westminster to have delivered another
damaging blow to the standing of a monarchy which has been plagued by
controversy for more than a year. They had also undercut much of the recent
criticism of the press by those MPs seeking tougher controls.
Mr Major's opposition killed the central recommendation of the report on the
press drawn up by Sir David Calcutt, QC, even before it was officially
published.
According to leaks of the report - confirmed as accurate by officials - Sir
David calls for the replacement of the present Press Complaints Commission
by a statutory tribunal with the powers to impose large fines on newspapers.
The report was handed to ministers last week and will be considered by the
full cabinet tomorrow but one senior minister commented bluntly last night:
'There is not a hope in hell of a statutory body.'
Lord McGregor of Durris, the chairman of the PCC and a fierce opponent of
statutory regulation, said last night that it was 'game, set and match' to
opponents of the Calcutt report. He described the section of the report
devoted to the PCC as 'reeking with prejudice and malice'.
Downing Street stressed that the prime minister's judgment had not been
affected by the latest revelations concerning the role played by Princess
Diana in the sensational reporting of her marriage problems.
Mr Major and other senior colleagues still backed the idea of new
legislation to outlaw electronic eavesdropping and other 'intrusive'
practices which involved trespass on private property.
The aim would be to protect all individuals from unjustified invasions of
privacy rather than to shield specifically the Royal Family and other
prominent public figures.
But the reports that close friends of Princess Diana fed information on her
behalf to the tabloids to ensure her case was present in stories about the
marriage break-up caused acute embarrassment in Downing Street.
It also raised new question marks among MPs about Mr Major's insistence last
month that the subsequent separation of the Royal couple would not prevent
Princess Diana at some stage being crowned Queen.
The disclosure was made in a letter sent by Lord McGregor to Sir David as
part of his inquiry. Lord McGregor revealed that Buckingham Palace had
apologised to him after first denying and then, in effect, admitting that
Princess Diana had actively collaborated in reports. Officials confirmed
that Mr Major and other senior ministers had been kept informed last year of
the charge laid by Lord Mc-Gregor.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commissioner aims to broaden scope of EC competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's competition policy will be exercised in a
determined, pragmatic and even-handed way 'without ideological
preconceptions', the new competition commissioner said yesterday.
Strict competition principles will not be the sole guidelines for EC
anti-trust and subsidy decisions over the next two years, Mr Karel Van Miert
told the Financial Times.
Mr Van Miert, a Flemish socialist who took over the portfolio a week ago,
indicated he would model EC competition policy on the German and Japanese
approaches, taking into account other influences, including industrial,
environmental, regional and social pressures.
'I'm inclined to look at the whole picture. Since I've received specific
responsibility for competition I will look after that element first. But I
will not lose sight of the other considerations and other interests
involved,' he said.
Mr Van Miert, 50, formerly commissioner for transport and consumer policy,
replaced Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's new trade commissioner, who was known as
a hardliner on competition policy. The move was quietly welcomed by EC
members like France and Italy, which bore the brunt of Sir Leon's campaign
against illegal state subsidies.
But Mr Van Miert warned yesterday there would be no change to existing rules
and pragmatism would not be 'a way of putting off things and being relaxed
about (competition)'.
Mr Van Miert has already won his free market spurs: as transport
commissioner, he pushed through liberalisation of the EC air transport
sector, which should bring down European air fares.
He said state aids would provide the biggest challenge of his term in
office, which will last only two years, assuming the Maastricht treaty is
ratified. In the past two years, he has approved state aid to Sabena, the
Belgian airline, and Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, on condition that
the companies were restructured and government did not inject more
subsidies.
Mr Van Miert indicated he might be more flexible than his predecessor about
the timescale for reducing state subsidies to individual companies, although
the objective - to avoid distortions of the EC single market - would be the
same.
'I don't share the view that the only credo should be less and less state
intervention. But if there is still state intervention it needs to be
efficient,' he said.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Serb leader agrees to peace plan for Bosnia: Assembly's
approval needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic last night accepted a
constitutional framework that could end the war in the republic, subject to
approval within seven days by the Bosnian Serb parliament.
In a dramatic reversal of his earlier rejection of a plan put forward by
international mediators, Mr Karadzic's decision came only hours after talks
in Geneva had been brought to the brink of collapse.
His agreement to the constitutional principles was announced in a communique
issued by the spokesman for Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of the rump
Yugoslav federation, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro.
According to Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, it should open the
way to adoption of the overall peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the conference, which includes an ending of
hostilities and division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into a state with 10
semi-autonomous provinces.
Mr Eckhard said: 'Our assumption is that the constitutional agreement is an
icebreaker.' He added that the negotiations on the other two agreements
would now go forward with a 'certain momentum'.
He expected the military agreement to be the easiest to complete since it
was 'already 95 per cent done'.
It was clear from the communique that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, and Mr Cosic, who had been asked by the co-chairmen to join the
negotiations between the warring factions in Bosnia, had played a crucial
role in swaying Mr Karadzic.
The communique spoke of 'the insistence' of the two presidents 'proceeding
from the interests of the Serbian people for a peaceful solution to the
crisis'.
Mr Milosevic said on leaving the talks: 'I must say that we have realised a
very essential, very important step towards peace.'
The draft constitutional principles accepted by Mr Karadzic recognise 'three
constituent peoples' in Bosnia - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - and state that
the proposed provinces into which Bosnia would be divided would not be able
to formulate foreign policy.
Mr Karadzic made clear he had been persuaded that the provinces would have a
wide measure of autonomy. 'You could say there will be many states within a
state. We are going to present it (the deal) honestly to our assembly and I
do think it is going to pass.'
Mr Karadzic told BBC radio last night that he would resign if the Bosnian
Serb parliament rejected the plan. However, he said he still objected to the
proposal to place all heavy weapons under UN control.
Earlier, any prospects for a peaceful solution seemed to have disappeared.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen said that Mr Karadzic had resisted pressure from all
sides to accept the constitutional principles.

changing the status of SA-2 and SA-3 missiles in the zone north of the 36th

FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: The Game of Love and Chance - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The title of Pierre Marivaux's play is teasingly misleading. There are
delectable games of love in The Game of Love and Chance, but the only chance
is the accident of birth. The upper middle class may pose as servants, and
vice versa, yet in the end no-one marries beneath or below their station and
the servants know their place.
The production at the Cottesloe, in a sparkling new translation by Neil
Bartlett, looks like Pirandello with a touch of Noel Coward. The Italian
connection is not surprising: Marivaux (1688-1763) belonged to the Italian
rather the Comedie Francaise wing of the Paris theatre. He rejected the more
formal approach of Moliere, wrote mainly in prose and went in for
knockabout. Where he foreshadows Pirandello is in playing games with
illusion and reality.
Noel Coward is thrown in as a bonus. Stefan Bednarczyk, as the bachelor
brother Maurice, even looks like him. He does a lot of languid
piano-playing. The period is Coward, too: the men in elegant dressing gowns,
the women constantly smoking, often with cigarette-holders. At least one
reference in the text is a direct parody of the famous line in Private
Lives: 'Funny how eloquent cheap emotions can be,' goes the new version.
The coup de theatre, however, is something quite different. It consists of
making Silvia, the principal girl, look a good deal older than one would
expect. Here is a triumphant performance by Maggie Steed. It is no
disrespect to her to say that she looks as if she has been in her upper
thirties for several years. In presenting her as a mature woman Bartlett,
who also directs along with Mike Alfreds, adds immeasurably to the feeling
that sometimes surfaces above the comedy. It is much more interesting to
watch an older, experienced woman fall in love than a strip of a coquette.
Unless I imagined it, Ms Steed's achievement goes beyond that. She looks
younger, with fewer lines on her face, when she is playing the society woman
she is than when she is posing as her maid Lisette. Then she appears
slightly haggard, bowed down by the troubles of the world. Is this a social
comment on the poor? Possibly, for The Game is a very social play in which
the prevailing hierarchy is never seriously challenged by the participants.
Take just two examples. Silvia, acting as the maid though with the audience
knowing precisely who she is, explains that she could certainly marry the
man she believes to be a chauffeur, if he were higher born and rich;
otherwise not, however much she loves him. The chauffeur-suitor, after
revealing that he has both those attributes, tells her that a man in his
position could not possibly offer more than to be faithful to her as his
mistress. Only at the end does he decide he can marry beneath himself, which
fittingly turns out not to be necessary.
There is a delightful, and totally related, sub-plot of two servants posing
as master and mistress. Played by Caroline Quentin and Marcello Magni, they
too make it to the altar, or at least to the final champagne.
If the plot in general sounds complicated in print, it is ever so simple on
stage. Besides, Ms Steed in particular frequently steps out of it and makes
her own comments to the audience. A minor criticism might be that Peter
Wingfield as the suitor looks a bit young for her, almost as if he was just
down from say Cambridge, but perhaps that is part of the fantasy. Pirandello
would have loved it.
The production is mounted jointly by the Cambridge Theatre Company and
Gloria in association with the RNT. It owes a lot to Bartlett's liberal
translation.

The Mafia can usually be relied on to make a good story. Most promising
programme of the evening is Allied to the Mafia (BBC 2, 8.10), in which the
historical documentary series 'Timewatch' examines the nuts and bolts of the
mutually rewarding relationship which the Americans struck up with the Mafia
ahead of the Allied landings in Sicily, 50 years ago.
Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century (BBC 1, 9.30) is a series which
thus far threatens to make no demands on anyone's grey cells. Tonight
James's survey of people in the limelight looks at the late 'twenties and
early 'thirties, the period which saw the arrival of the 'talkies', the
reluctantly famous Charles Lindbergh, and the infamous Al Capone. But if you
are looking for something more taxing the nature of scientific research is
explored in the concluding part of Culture Clash (BBC 2, 11.15).
Unless your New Year's resolution was to wade through Richardson's enormous
novel, there is much to be said for watching Clarissa (BBC 2, 9. 25), the
well-made TV adaptation in three parts which tonight returns for its second
run.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: Germany on the couch - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Generalising about nations and races is a tricky and not entirely
respectable business, even though whole careers are built on it. The
superior view is that using national stereotypes is vulgar and mentally
lazy. Yet much depends on how sophisticated the generalisation is or, at the
very least, on how it is phrased. 'What one should remember about the French
is . . .'; 'The key to the Finnish character is . . .'; those are the
conversational markers which initially suggest the wisdom of the well-read,
well-travelled observer, rather than - although it may indeed be the case -
the bar-room bigot.
The Essential History of Europe: Germany (BBC 2 on Thursdays) was an
extraordinarily interesting programme which brandished the sophisticate's
version of the national stereotype. We were presented with a classic
definition of the German as someone obsessed by the 'vices' of obedience,
discipline, order, and gripped by an exaggerated sense of dedication and
perfection. Germans fear the outsider. Germans are always looking over their
shoulder at the past.
Just the stuff, one might think, to fuel the prejudices of bar-room bigots
everywhere. However, observations which would have sounded highly dubious
from the mouth of a non-German sounded respectable when spoken as
pessimistic home-truths. The cleverness of this film was to put Germany on
the couch and, apart from an English narrator (perhaps a mistake), to make
German speakers and the German language itself stand as witnesses to the
troubled state of the German soul.
Most prominent among the speakers was a psychotherapist from Halle in former
East Germany called Hans Joachim Maaz. Author of a recent book about the
psychological trauma of reunification for East Germans, Maaz proposes an
ominous view of the national psyche which few foreigners would feel
comfortable about expressing at a German dinner table.
According to Maaz, the German suffers from the lack of a clear point of
view, the consequence of being the obedient child produced by an
authoritarian state. Democracy has been no more than imposed like a mask, a
mantle, on a people whose history has created deep within them an 'inner
fascism'. Setting fire to the homes of Auslander is an all-too typical
manifestation of 'the hidden destructive forces which can emerge any
moment'.
The film was intelligently structured around conceptual signposts;
Zerissenheit, meaning 'a condition of inner strife'; Vergangenheit
Bewaltigungs or 'overcoming the past', Heimat, 'homeland', and so on. We
heard the terms spoken and, in a hopeful attempt to make them stick, were
shown them written. That kind of didacticism would probably have made your
average bar-room bigot switch off long before the grim forebodings of the
programme's conclusion, about Seelischer Emfremdung and what will happen
should western capitalism ultimately fail to deliver the material goodies
which currently compensate for the Germans' spiritual bankruptcy.
But does this kind of analysis, which to many a British person would seem
merely pretentious, actually take us near what real, live Germans worry
about? I suspect that it may do, to judge from the experience of learning
German at London's Goethe Institut. Even though we are mere babes attempting
to get our feeble intelligences around the subjunctive tense, Teacher has
already introduced the resonant concept of Vergangenheits Bewaltigung. Only
this week she was exhorting us to attend a public seminar on VB, to be
addressed by a minor government minister. Which suggests to me that
Essential History did get it right, and that the Germans really do revel in
discussing their collective psyche in public.
Now Americans, I fondly believe, possess an innate conviction that the world
can always be shaped to accommodate their wishes. So it was gratifying on
Horizon's Cheating Time (BBC 2, Monday) to hear a 53 year-old singer called
Jonie Mosby Mitchell state, 'We don't have to accept the menopause any
longer. You can do anything you want'. And so Jonie ignored the ineluctable
onset of ageing, the age-freckles on her hands and crowsfeet, and the
withering of her womb four years previously with the menopause. She went
right ahead and had herself a nice little baby boy which she loves very
much.
However, to be accurate, it is only 50 per cent her baby, and genetically
not hers at all - and if you are watching Channel 4's absorbing series on
sociobiology, The Sexual Imperative on Thursdays at 9.00, you will
appreciate what an unnatural thing that is. New techniques being practised
in the US implant the eggs of donor mothers, fertilised by a woman's
partner, into the womb of post-menopausal women which have been rejuvenated
with hormones. It costs around Dollars 11,000.
Well, frankly, I do not hold with it. However, implantation looks a rather
different matter when you see a young woman in her twenties who has already
experienced the menopause. Should she just bow to fate? But there again, why
should any of us women accept the menopause which one doctor described as
'one of nature's design faults.'
We are the only animal to have this particular design fault, and to lead
such long lives after we become reproductively useless. Already the
technology exists to freeze the eggs of fruitflies and return them to their
aged mums which then buzz about like youngsters and live many days longer
than they should. So it stands to reason, does it not, that some women are
going to want to have babies in order to live into their hundreds? Is that
kind of selfishness really possible? I would say yes. After all, Jonie
Mitchell admitted she had never asked herself what it would be like for the
child of her autumnal years to have such an antique mum. But that is not
really part of the picture, is it, if your creed is, 'You can do anything
you want?'

FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: Punch and Judy - Opera in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pierre Audi, for ten years (1979-89) director of London's Almeida Theatre,
developed during that time an enviable reputation as a deviser of programmes
 -what was today discovered (or re-discovered) at the annual Almeida
Festival tended to become tomorrow's musical fashion. Since 1989 he has been
artistic director of the Netherlands Opera; and, notwithstanding the
differences of style and substance between a small London avant-garde
enterprise and one of Europe's most important opera companies, Audi has
swiftly settled in to demonstrate the same skills in Amsterdam.
The blend of fare, casts and production teams has been balanced with
imaginative flair. Audi regularly directed both plays and operas in his time
at the Almeida; at the Muziektheater he continues to stage works (his recent
Monteverdi Ritorno d'Ulisse was highly praised on this page by Andrew
Clements). This season features, for instance, the first Dutch performances
of Harrison Birtwistle's and Stephen Pruslin's Punch and Judy (1968), in an
Audi production conducted by Oliver Knussen.
To my mind Birtwistle's first opera, a 'tragical comedy or comical tragedy',
stands as one of the key works, one of the extraordinary, unrepeatable
outbursts of iconoclastic vitality in postwar British music. Its productions
have been few - it is a chamber opera at once robustly entertaining and
knottily complex - but almost all have etched themselves deep in the memory
of their devotees (the 1982 Opera Factory version was a peak of that
company's achievements).
Alas, on the evidence of its opening night, this new Amsterdam Punch and
Judy may well be remembered for rather different reasons: it seemed to me,
in several key respects, a flop of depressingly large proportions.
With hindsight it becomes clear that the attempt to do the opera in this
theatre at all was on Audi's part a rare miscalculation. The stage, that
huge Cinerama space, caused the tightly mapped formal patterns of
Birtwistle's angularly lyrical vocal lines and Pruslin's elaborately witty
verbal sallies to be spread out and, almost all of the time, to become
hopelessly blurred. Then there is the matter of the Muziektheater acoustics,
a modern disaster of uncommunicative dryness. (Only the Paris Bastille's are
worse.) The physical unsuitability and acoustical limitations of the space
managed, between them, to achieve the previously unimaginable - the blunting
of the famously abrasive edge to Birtwistle's chamber-ensemble
instrumentation.
Word-inaudibility was a constant; admittedly, composer and librettist built
in a pretty considerable Comprehension Problem in the first place, but it
needs to be grasped, not comprehensively evaded. Audi's production, which
forsook the puppet-show setting and props specified in the stage directions,
had as its background four gigantic inflatable dolls, hung on wires and
slowly moved around. This was a stupendous feat of design (by the celebrated
German artist Baselitz) whose qualities of monumental primitivism added to
the general feeling of lethargy and deadened dramatic purpose.
Individual roles were characterised by costume (brilliant
punk-cum-Beckettian invention by Jorge Lara) and by physical motions
carefully routined - Punch jerks, slides and stumbles as if himself operated
on wires, the Choregos prances about as a mixture of the clown Grock and
Little Lord Fauntleroy. There was much well-crafted theatrical imagery on
show, which was translated into particularly vivid action by Robert Poulton
(Punch) and David Wilson-Johnson (Choregos), outstanding members of the
six-strong cast.
But the confrontation in the opera of ancient and modern, ritual and
burlesque, seemed entirely to escape this staging, which substituted instead
an all-purpose air of Art. In the pit, at least, Knussen and the players of
the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra managed to convey a much more lucid and
idiomatic command of the work (but what were they all doing down there? The
score calls for the disposition of the players into stage and pit bands).
The number of audience members that I could see fast asleep in their seats
by the three-quarter point of the unbroken 100-minute stretch suggested - as
did much else in the performance - that the opera's cause will not have been
greatly advanced by its first showing in Amsterdam.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Arts: New Park Lane series - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the week when the Park Lane Group, each January, presents a pair of
Purcell Room concerts by 'Young Artists' every week-night.
As usual the musical fare is all 20th-century, most of it recent, and two
composers are specially featured, Nicholas Maw and the Scot Edward
McGuire(the latter born, according to the programme-book, variously in 1948,
1958 and 1984).
On Monday Maw was represented by the second of his six inventive Personae
for piano, delivered with gleaming clarity by Thomas Ades. Ades boasts a
masterly control of touch and colour. In Gyorgy Kurtag's three In Memoriam
pieces and their prefatory 'Chorale', he balanced the notes of chords with
phenomenal subtlety, as well as flawless sympathy with Kurtag's individual
manner.
His command of more flamboyant, rhetorical music by the early Messiaen
(another elegiac piece, for Paul Dukas) and by Paul Ruders seemed effortless
 -though the grip of Ruders' Sonata No. 2 slackens after its strong,
promising first movement.
Ades is also a composer, and his new Still Sorrowing - a lament which is
also a homage to Romantic sentiments - proved to make the most ingenious use
of a 'prepared' piano that I have heard in a long time. While a recurrent
plaint tintinnabulates at the top the piano's range and deep chords resonate
at the bottom, some muffling device allows intricate figures and rhythms at
mid-keyboard to rattle hollowly; a haunting sound-scape and too strikingly
musical to seem tricksy.
In the second recital, the Chione Oboe Trio were crisp and well-tuned in
pieces by McGuire, James Macmillan and John Lunn - all efficiently designed
for the medium, which has its limits but none so fetchingly as Joseph
Landers' recent Echo Dancers.
More potent stuff was heard from a splendid cellist, Paul Watkins, keenly
and forcefully partnered by the pianist Elizabeth Upchurch.
They did sweeping justice to Elliott Carter's 1948 Sonata, a work that
cannot fail to thrill when performed with such intelligence and fervour.
And Philip Cashian's new Dancing with Venus (a PLG commission) is a winner;
inspired by an Angela Carter short story, the cello enacts a series of
little dances or poses, sexy or ironic or mocking, and they add up to
something considerably more than a string of vignettes.
Cellists with the advanced technique that Cashian requires should fall upon
the piece without delay.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Unsung heroes of the sea -
When a shipping disaster strikes, the salvors step in. Deborah Hargreaves on
how they limit the damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First light over the Shetland Islands yesterday finally dashed the salvage
experts' hopes of saving some of the oil from the stricken tanker Braer
before it leaked into the sea. Early flights over the tanker showed it had
broken into four sections after being pounded by mountainous waves on
Sumburgh Head where it ran aground a week ago.
Most of its cargo of 85,000 tonnes of Norwegian crude oil has now been
discharged into the sea. Geert Koffeman from the Dutch company Smit Tak,
which is handling the salvage operation, said there could still be some oil
on board, 'but we are no longer talking of thousands of tonnes  - just
hundreds'.
Until Monday, Smit Tak, the world's largest salvage company, remained
sanguine about being able to pump out oil from the stricken tanker's cargo
hold. But some of the worst weather ever experienced in the Shetland Islands
hampered the operation so that salvors could not even board the ship.
'The first thing to do is to get on board so that you can at least assess
the state of the tanker and the amount of oil left,' said Net Lindquist at
Smit Tak. But in hurricane-force winds which have battered the islands in
the past week, attempting to board the tanker has proved hazardous.
Smit Tak has had two teams of six salvage experts in the Shetland Islands
since late last week accompanied by two tugs. The company sent out a special
salvage barge from Rotterdam on Friday which could be used for storing the
oil if it is pumped off the broken tanker.
Salvage companies have strong financial incentives to rescue as much oil as
they can, thereby keeping pollution to a minimum. Revisions to salvage
contracts which took place in 1989 mean a company is now paid for limiting
environmental damage even if it cannot save the ship.
The salvors are the unsung heroes of many a shipping disaster. Shipowners
can have a tendency to regard them as vultures since they position their
salvage tugs at strategic points around the globe so they can be on hand in
case of a disaster. But if they move in swiftly, they can often preempt
great environmental damage by removing dangerous cargoes quickly.
The difficulties experienced by Smit Tak in the Shetland Islands highlight
the dangers and frustrations of a salvage operation which is always
performed in the worst conditions. In the same way that Red Adair and other
US companies hasten to raging oil well fires, salvors are at the sharp end
of the international shipping industry.
The salvage industry is one dominated by a few important international
companies which has found itself under increasing financial pressure in
recent years. It can cost up to Pounds 1m a year to keep a fully-equipped
salvage tug on call to attend a disaster at hours' notice, but the rewards
paid for a salvage operation are declining amid fierce competition.
Some countries such as France, Spain and Italy fund salvage tugs from
government money, but these cannot prevent tanker disasters and are not even
a guarantee against widespread environmental pollution.
Although all disasters are different, salvors will attempt at first to
assess the state of a tanker's cargo tanks in the hope they can bring in
pumping equipment to pump out the oil either on to land or to an
accompanying barge.
Smit Tak was hoping to pump out the oil from the Braer to an awaiting barge.
But salvage operations must usually begin within hours or, at the very
least, days of a disaster, otherwise fuel tanks rupture and much of the oil
escapes.
Once the cargo has been pumped from a stricken tanker, salvage crews will
try to lift the ship up and tow it to port where it can either be repaired
or scrapped. Smit Tak is now considering towing sections of the Braer out to
sea and sinking them or saving parts of the vessel for their salvage value.
Under previous international conventions, Smit Tak would have risked
receiving no pay at all if the ship went under. But new contracts prepared
by Lloyd's, the insurance market, reward the companies for expenses incurred
in trying to minimise environmental damage even if the ship sinks.
As salvors have assumed more responsibility for pollution, and tanker design
has become more complex, the industry has complained that its resources to
respond are limited. The International Salvage Union - a group of the chief
companies - commissioned a report into the industry which it said was 'in a
perilous state'.
The report published in April last year by the consulting group, Tecnitas,
pointed to a decline in the availability of salvage services worldwide. This
is chiefly because the increasing safety of tankers has given few
opportunities for salvage companies to make money.
However, the consultants pointed out that, although the number of serious
shipping disasters had declined from 938 in 1981 to 712 in 1991, the number
of incidents rose by 30 per cent in 1991. It raises the concern that the
industry may become so run down that it will be unable to cope with a rise
in demand for its services in future.
The tanker industry itself is also strapped for cash and does not have the
funds to renew its ageing fleet. With salvors facing financial pressures and
the UK so far unwilling to fund its own salvage tugs, another disaster of
the scale of the Braer could prove even more problematic to clean up.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Life after Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DID WE really save the earth at Rio?' asks environmentalist Stanley Johnson
in the introduction to The Earth Summit*, the first full compilation of the
documents from last year's green jamboree in Brazil.
Too soon to say, is the short answer. Rio was certainly not a triumph
because it fell short on all its chief aims. On the other hand, it was not a
disaster either because it attracted more than 100 heads of government and
produced two international treaties.
Johnson, who attended the summit and edited this book, argues that it is
wrong to blame Rio for failing to achieve the much hoped for 'global
bargain' on saving the environment for the simple reason that this bargain
was never even on the table. The positions of the various interest groups -
the industrial countries, the Third World, the US and the EC - were too far
apart to permit agreement.
The rich countries could have helped Rio by offering larger financial
inducements for poorer countries to co-operate on a global clean-up. On the
other hand, nothing could induce the US to lower its opposition to a firm
timetable to reduce greenhouse gases, or to the treaty on bio-diversity.
The positive result of Rio, Johnson believes, lies in defining terms of the
global environment debate, and in initiating a negotiating process. That
process will continue and should eventually produce more concrete results,
particularly with the arrival of the greener US president.
Not that Rio's results were thin, judging, at least, by the contents of this
book. Its 500 densely packed pages contain all the major documents from Rio,
including the whole of Agenda 21 with its global clean-up plan, providing an
essential reference for anyone with an environmental interest.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Stamping out Greece's pine
fires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few trees so inflammable as the resinous Aleppo pine that provides
a green backdrop for summer villas and tourist resorts along much of
Greece's coastline. When fire breaks out, exploding pine cones shoot out in
all directions.
Last year, a record number of fires devastated more than 50,000 hectares of
forest, scrub and grazing land around Greece. The forestry service logged
2,100 fires - almost double the average for the three previous years - in a
season marked by prolonged hot weather and fierce winds.
Despite increased spending on firefighting aircraft, communications systems
and hiring several thousand temporary forest guards for the summer,
governments have failed to establish an effective fire protection system.
Indeed, as firefighting methods grow more sophisticated, it becomes harder
to enlist public support for the forestry service. 'People just sit in the
cafe watching the fire and waiting for the aeroplanes to start dropping
water,' says Dimitris Katsoudas, the government's secretary general for
forestry.
However, the disastrous fires in 1992, including blazes on Rhodes and Crete,
Greece's two most popular tourist islands, prompted a switch in policy. The
government says it will shortly seek bids from private companies to set up a
nationwide fire protection service.
Greece's pine forests have grown more vulnerable to fire because of steady
depopulation of the countryside, together with the encroachment of tourism.
Access to forest areas became easier as the coastline was opened up for
development. Villagers who return home for the summer to cater for tourists
no longer make use of the forest.
'Woodland isn't considered a resource. The charcoal-burners and
resin-tappers are gone. Dry branches and undergrowth aren't collected for
fuel so when a fire starts there's a wealth of combustible material,' says
George Mavrommatis, head of the Forest Research Institute in Athens.
What Greece needs is better prevention techniques and improved co-ordination
in firefighting, according to Conair, a Canadian company that has studied
forest fires in Greece and operates fire protection services in other
Mediterranean countries.
'Communications and training are crucial in firefighting. Aircraft should be
used with discrimination - after all, you have no guarantee the fire is out
without people on the ground,' says Jim Dunkel, Conair's vice president.
Without better prevention, the coastal forests will go on shrinking.
Regardless of the law on reforestation, only about 10 per cent of burned
acreage is replanted in an average year, mainly because the forestry service
is chronically short of funds. This year, the figure will rise to 20 per
cent thanks to support from the European Community, which will cover 75 per
cent of the Dr8bn (Pounds 24m) cost of replanting 10,000 hectares.
Although Aleppo pine is often used for replanting as it grows quickly, the
Forest Research Institute has pioneered cultivation of less inflammable
trees. It recommends planting spiny varieties of oak similar to those that
covered Greek hillsides in ancient times.
Yet the chances of restoring forest cover are sharply reduced unless
barriers are built to stop soil erosion and water loss. And even if the
water-table remains high enough to support tree growth, young saplings are
often eaten by roaming goats.
'The biggest enemy of forest regeneration is the huge goat population in
Greece of about 6m. Goat herds are in short supply these days, but EC
subsidies encourage farmers to keep goats, who let them run free much of the
time,' says Katsoudas.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Jobs: We have ways of turning you off - If managers can't
accentuate the positive, they could at least try eliminating the negative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH doubtless still full of zest, you readers will mostly be old enough
to have forgotten how it felt to leave your teenage years behind. So you are
unlikely to remember the anxiety about impending adulthood, which - mingled
with pride, of course - the Jobs column feels on passing its 20th birthday.
Fortunately my confidence received a boost during a visit to Ivan Robertson,
Professor of Occupational Psychology at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology. He reported that, while watching his
young son playing football, he'd been approached by another spectating dad
who'd handed him a strip of pink paper and urged him to read it there and
then. 'It turned out to be one of your articles,' the professor intoned, as
though he were recounting some inexplicable dream.
Even so, a column surely can't be all that bad if it gets bandied about at
football matches. And if the clearly most intelligent but alas un-named dad
in question is ever in the FT's vicinity, I owe him several drinks.
My reason for calling on Ivan Robertson was that among the things on which
he's an authority is a subject that has proved of keen interest to readers
down the years: people's motivation to work. Indeed, he is the leading
author of the book* on the topic published by Britain's Institute of
Personnel Management.
As the book makes clear, expert views on motivation have changed since this
column's babyhood. Two decades back, there was an optimistic belief abroad
that all human beings will become well motivated if their jobs are properly
designed. So provided that organisations set up the jobs appropriately - by
'enriching' them with suitable challenges, for example - everyone who came
to work for them would have high motivation.
That pleasant notion has now given way to a more pessimistic view. It is
that far from being alike in capacity, some people are intrinsically and
perhaps even genetically more motivated than others, and so put greater
effort into anything they are called upon to do. Hence there is no
'universal motivator' in the sense of a formula for galvanising the whole of
a workforce.
On hearing of the changed view, however, the Jobs column recalled the
logician's gag about the converse not necessarily applying, enshrined by
Lewis Carroll's immortal dormouse's dictum that although he breathes when he
sleeps, it's not true that he sleeps when he breathes.
By the same token, the fact that companies have no way to turn everyone on,
needn't mean they have no ways of turning everyone off. So I asked Professor
Robertson whether there might be any universal de-motivators.
On reflection, he replied he could think of several. For a start, since
research had shown that people need to know their efforts are paying off in
terms of expected results, one good off-turner would be to give them no
feedback. Even better might be to provide feedback, but scramble it so the
links between effort and rewards appear entirely random.
The same end would be served by work-goals that are vague, if not downright
contradictory, especially if imposed from on high without explanation, let
alone consultation.
Still further potential lay in arbitrary controls, he went on, as
exemplified by management reacting to an obviously isolated incident by
clapping a permanent straitjacket on everybody. I rejoined that a case in
point had happened at an army training camp miles from anywhere in the days
of national service.
When a 48-hour leave came up, one recruit who lived too far away to get home
was left all alone with nothing to do. So he scraped the black enamel off
his iron bedstead and polished the metal until it shone like silver. It so
impressed the commanding officer that he ordered the whole camp to do
likewise. Thereafter, the pioneer polisher spent all his free time climbing
out of the emergency water supply tank only to be thrown back in by the next
set of waiting squaddies.
Ivan Robertson felt that the commandant had missed a trick. A truly skilled
demotivator would have promoted the pioneer to sergeant-major. 'But
seriously,' he added, 'once you think about ways of turning everyone off,
you suddenly realise what an awful lot of managers use them.'
NOW to the table below which sheds some light on a query often posed by
people considering going to work overseas - 'if I went abroad, how much
would it cost to keep up the same living standard for the family?'
The figures are provided by the Employment Conditions Abroad consultancy
which keeps check on pay-rates and cost-levels in more than 150 countries.
Since I have room for only nine of them, however, anyone wanting information
on the others will need to contact Barry Rodin of ECA at 15 Britten St,
London SW3 3TY; telephone (0)71-351 7151, fax (0)71-351 9396.
The pattern for the exercise is a middle management job, such as the head of
marketing in a medium sized company. Taking managers of that kind from each
of the nine countries covered, the table shows their typical gross salary
and outlays at home, and the cost of keeping up the same buying habits in
the other eight lands. The cost figures relate solely to spending on
consumer-type goods and services, no account being taken of housing.
Other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates
prevailing at the close of London markets last Friday night. The ranking of
the countries is determined by how much their native executive spends when
based at home.
By that yardstick, the Swiss with Pounds 19,721 worth of purchases make the
Brits with Pounds 11,232 look relatively cheese-paring, although the Dutch
and Australians are thriftier still.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Management: Short cut to the top - Adrian Furnham assesses
the value of rigorous outdoor training courses in developing better
executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does getting wet, cold and generally miserable in the countryside help you
to become a better manager? Supporters of outward bound courses believe it
does, but critics question the value of having highly-paid and specialised
executives tramping around the woods honing boy scout-level skills.
Is outdoor training not just a way of keeping ageing physical exercise
teachers, sadistic ex-corporals and overpaid consultants employed? And is it
just an expensive fad in training, no better or worse than classroom
teaching?
Cynics demand proof of success in the form of a cost-benefit formula.
Finding none, or at least nothing that satisfies them, they reject the
notion of outdoor training altogether.
Some sceptics argue that the more realistic the training in terms of what,
where and how you learn skills, the more effective it is. And because
outdoor training is hardly a simulation of business life, it cannot really
work.
So what is the philosophy of outdoor training? Essentially there are three
good arguments:
Experimental versus theoretical learning. Since the 1960s, when encounter
groups thrived, trainers have claimed that real learning occurs when people
are put in difficult, novel and problematic situations and not when they
study elaborate theories or abstract ideas.
In trainer jargon, 'unfreezing' needs to take place before people really
learn about themselves and others.
The philosophy of outdoor training is that people learn most about
themselves, their teams, and their limitations, by 'doing'.
'No gain without the pain' is the catchphrase, and the pain is not the cold,
damp and discomfort but dealing with performance issues in an unfamiliar
setting.
Emotions not ideas. Most training courses are about ideas, concepts, skills
and models. They involve brain work and traditional classroom activities.
But outdoor trainers claim that modern management is as much about
self-confidence and courage.
Most training, they point out, aims at the head but not the heart, whereas
outdoor training is unashamedly about emotional learning.
Anyone who has been on an outdoor training course will tell you immediately
about the emotions they experience: from blind fear to anger and fury; from
depression and self-doubt to tension-releasing humour.
An important aim of outdoor training is to teach people that when pushed to
the limit of their ability, they can call on extra reserves of commitment.
The great Victorian virtues of self-reliance, fortitude, even stoicism, can
be, and need to be, learned if you are to be a successful manager.
This does not take place with the cold learning experience of the classroom
but in the stressful experience of physical discomfort or even danger.
Team membership not leadership. There are plenty of leadership courses but
not too many for those who have to follow. Despite mouthing platitudes about
teams and team work, Anglo-Americans come from an individualistic, not a
collective, culture. Team work does not come easily or naturally.
But learning to sail a yacht in choppy seas or to cross a gorge using a
pulley, sling and ropes requires real co-operation. Teams engaged in
difficult physical tasks need to be inter-dependent: you need your
colleagues and they need you. You cannot survive on your own.
Managers also need to learn how to be effective members of a team but this
is rarely learned in the classroom, making paper models or being
video-taped.
Of course, not all outdoor training provides all the benefits. And certainly
outdoor training is not always appropriate. Indeed, it can backfire in
unusual ways.
Rather than gaining self-confidence, some people can experience nothing but
self-doubt. They can return broken, not built-up. Others, discovering
new-found strengths and abilities, pack up their briefcases and go to other
organisations believing they can improve their career prospects.
The problem lies in measuring the effectiveness of training. How can one
show conclusively that the time and money spent on outdoor courses is well
spent?
That is a fiendishly difficult question because although one can easily
think of many possible measures, nearly all have problems.
But more importantly, perhaps, any training is unlikely to succeed if the
organisation is not prepared to allow employees to apply in everyday
practice the lessons they have learned.
For example, if a risk-averse organisation sends managers who it has
rewarded for their caution and prudence on a course designed to make them
more adventuresome and then punishes them for the very behaviour they learn,
it is no wonder the course is seen as a waste of time.
Outdoor training is, however, neither a panacea nor a total waste of time.
If, as a company, you know what you want and what a good course can offer,
you may be able to provide for your employees an enriching, even invaluable
experience.
A bad course with no planned outcomes may result in increased employee
cynicism, let alone colds, scratches and occasionally very badly bruised
egos.
It should not be dismissed as nonsense nor embraced as the only solution.
Chosen judiciously, and run well, outdoor training can provide a unique
learning experience.

FT  13 JAN 93 / People: Keeping R-R's show on the road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mid-1980s, to visit Rolls-Royce's car plant at Crewe, Cheshire, was
to step back into a bygone, labour-intensive manufacturing age.
Today the Vickers subsidiary is almost unrecognisable, with the old labour
demarcation lines gone and heavy investment made to integrate manufacturing
and engineering.
At 39, Charles Matthews has the job of keeping this entire modernised
manufacturing show on the road through his newly created post as director of
manufacturing operations. Matthews, formerly Rolls' director of personnel
and systems, assumes responsibility for manufacturing, engineering,
purchasing, personnel and quality.
A close familiarity with them all is seen as essential for an integrated
manufacturing operation targeted at slashing the luxury car maker's
break-even production to 1,400 cars a year. Last year, as recession bit
deeper in its major markets, Rolls' sales fell by a further 20 per cent to
only 1,348 compared with about 3,000 in the 1980s.
Matthews' ride with Rolls has been an exciting one, his arrival coinciding
closely with the collapse of luxury car markets worldwide and making an
abrupt change from his three-year tenure at food group Nabisco, where he was
factory general manager.
However, Matthews is no stranger to the ups and downs of the car industry.
The Nabisco sojourn was in fact his only foray outside car making in a
career which began with the then-British Leyland back in 1975.

FT  13 JAN 93 / People: Johnson crosses the Square to Pictet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Johnson, who quit as boss of Invesco MIM's non-North American
interests on Christmas Eve, has resurfaced in short order as chief
investment officer of the London end of Swiss private bankers, Geneva-based
Pictet. Relocating only across Devonshire Square in the City of London,
Johnson is, however, moving to an institution whose ethos is likely to be
very different.
Johnson, formerly joint deputy chairman of Invesco, effectively lost out
last July when Charles Brady took over from Lord Stevens as group chief
executive - even if the clash in management styles between Johnson and Brady
did not come to a head until a board meeting last month after which Johnson
resigned.
Pictet, a distinguished Swiss private bank founded in 1805 and wholly owned
by its partners, two of whom are Pictet family, manages around Dollars 30bn
in assets worldwide. Former colleagues, who pointed out that Johnson's early
field of particular expertise had been the Far East, surmised that Johnson
would be happy to return to the world of pure investment - after the thorny
management issues, including the Drayton Consolidated affair as well as the
Maxwell debacle, with which he had to deal while at Invesco.
Still only 39, Johnson joined Samuel Montagu 16 years ago as a management
trainee - after graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford, aged 19 with a
history degree, as well as a subsequent degree in the history of art from
the Courtauld Institute.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boardroom upheaval continues at B Elliott as the streamlined engineering
group tries to restructure its way out of the recession and reduce its
exposure to the depressed machine tool trade.
The group has announced that Trevor Smith, group human resources director,
resigned on January 8 'as a result of the recent restructuring'.
Smith was not being replaced, because the smaller size of the group no
longer warranted his position. His departure follows Jim Martin's
resignation as director last week.
In September last year, Eddie Addison resigned from the board to enable him
to concentrate on subsidiary Addison Tube Forming.
B Elliott is looking to sell its remaining machine tool operations, once its
core business, to concentrate on specialist and electrical engineering. The
group's market value has shrunk from Pounds 45m in mid-1991 to Pounds 11.1m
after shares were relisted last month following the announcement of a
refinancing package including a Pounds 16.3m debt-equity swap.
Following the resignation of Sir Norman Fowler as non-executive director
last May, the company has appointed another three non-executives to the
board with effect from the beginning of the year. They are Neil Falkner, 65,
chairman and chief executive of Falkner Moller Partners, an investment
management company that after the restructuring holds 46.7 per cent of the
equity; Chris Wood, 51, an executive director of FMS who was in the past on
the board of Renold; and William Eccles, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial
Ventures which now holds a 16.8 per cent stake in B Elliott.

Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Eugene Freedman, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the US, has just been
appointed chairman of the international Coopers &amp; Lybrand network.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand (International) is an association of autonomous national
professional accountancy and consulting firms, with 733 offices in 121
countries.
Freedman replaces Brandon Gough, chairman of the UK firm who has completed
his two-year term. He was selected by what he calls 'informal consensus'
among the executive committee of the network.
Freedman sees his role of chairman as 'setting the agenda, leading the
business and causing things to happen. We want a heavy market client focus
in the aggressive pursuit of business,' he says, focusing particularly on
western and eastern Europe and the Far East. The firm will also concentrate
on organising around 'world clients'.
He hastily adds that profits for the partnership are also important, but
will follow from his priorities for Coopers: 'Relevant, responsive, timely,
efficient, value-added services. The provision of services is where the
rubber hits the road,' he says.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Flood of recriminations after leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE power of the newspaper leak has rarely been deployed to greater effect.
On Friday a report by Sir David Calcutt QC, advocating the creation of a
statutory Press Complaints Tribunal, was delivered to Mr Peter Brooke, the
National Heritage Secretary.
By yesterday, thanks to two devasting leaks, Sir David's report was sinking
almost without trace before it had even been published.
'It looks to me like game, set and match (to the press),' Lord McGregor,
chairman of the Press Complaints Commission said yesterday with a certain
glee.
Lord McGregor, who denies all knowledge of or involvement in the leaks, was
particularly scandalised at yesterday's leak: his own letter to Sir David,
which was printed verbatim in The Guardian. It suggested that, far from
being exploited by the press, the Prince and Princess of Wales had recruited
national newspapers to carry their own accounts of their marital rifts.
In the letter, Lord McGregor said his information had been obtained at a
private dinner with Lord Rothermere, the proprietor of the Daily Mail, and
asked that, whatever happened to the rest of the letter, that paragraph
should not be published.
'I am absolutely scandalised that the letter was circulated all over
Whitehall. It must have been circulated through Calcutt's office,' Lord
McGregor said.
The PCC chairman is still fuming at the second and third chapters of the new
Calcutt report, devoted to the work of the self-regulatory body.
'It was reeking with prejudice and malice,' said Lord McGregor, who was not
prepared to discuss it with Sir David.
He insists: 'But I didn't leak a word about it.'
Someone who has seen the new Calcutt report insists that the leaks in the
Sunday newspapers are 'close but not that close.'
While there is little doubt that Sir David has recommended the replacement
of the PCC with a statutory tribunal, it will probably be Friday before
details become available when the report is published.
Thanks to high-level briefings on the leaks - which may or may not have been
politically inspired - it is now clear that Mr John Major, the prime
minister, has no intention of introducing a statutory tribunal chaired by a
judge with or without the power to impose fines on errant newspapers.
All that is good news for Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun.
He told a radio phone-in show: 'I don't fancy a month in the Scrubs
(prison), but if it was something that we believed in then I can see editors
going off to jail - no doubt about it.'
Legislation against electronic eavesdropping and recording private telephone
calls without serious public interest is now considered inevitable.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Adequate safety requirements for BR
train operators after privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to privatise British Rail will increase the number and severity of
railway accidents unless adequate safety requirements are imposed on train
operators, the Health and Safety Executive warned in a report published
yesterday, John Willman writes.
The HSE, the independent, government-funded safety watchdog, said that
current safety standards on the UK railways were high but could be raised
further. But maintaining current standards depended on the close integration
of BR's operations, which privatisation will split between many different
organisations.
'Companies with little or no previous experience of operating on the railway
and managers with limited experience of railway safety issues will enter the
industry,' the HSE said.
New controls will be needed to curb the risk of accidents, the HSE said. The
list of 38 recommendations - all accepted by the government - includes a
mass of new regulations covering matters such as the transport of dangerous
substances by rail and the assesment of the competence of train drivers.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Commons prepares for clash on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs WERE bracing themselves last night for the possibility of an all-night
sitting when the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty returns to the
Commons today, David Owen writes.
As leading figures on both sides of the Euro-divide finalised preparations
for resumption of battle, there was talk at Westminster that the government
might opt to force a trial of strength with Euro-sceptics and Opposition
tacticians by moving tonight that the debate continue beyond 10pm.
Labour has called a running three-line whip but will not say whether they
would oppose any motion to have tonight's sitting extended. All sides are
playing their cards close to their chest in what is expected to be a tense
and exhausting war of nerves lasting at least until June.
Euro-sceptics remain determined to force an embarrassing reversal and are
making every effort to retain their discipline.
A meeting on tactics was scheduled for last night. Euro-sceptic leaders have
produced a series of detailed briefs on subjects to be covered as the debate
proceeds, aiming to allocate specific briefs to specific people.
The cross-party Commons' members interests committee spent more than two
hours last night agreeing a report on Pounds 18,000 received from an unnamed
donor by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to help evict an unwanted tenant
from his London house.
The report, expected to propose tighter rules for MPs on declaring anonymous
gifts, will be published on Monday.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs rap Maxwell lawyers over cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS social security committee yesterday harshly criticised the
lawyers and accountants responsible for recovering assets stolen from the
pension funds of the late Robert Maxwell and urged that no further
government funds be spent on pensioners until the advisers distributed the
funds they had collected.
Mr Frank Field MP, the Labour chairman, said: 'We are anxious that the
government does not increase (funding) further or the whole wretched process
will drag on for another year.'
The committee released a report on its hearings into the operation to
recover more than Pounds 440m stolen from the pension funds. Administrators
to the various pension schemes are disputing each other's claims to some of
the assets recovered, preventing them from being paid to pensioners.
The MPs recommended that Sir John Cuckney, who is heading a
government-sponsored trust raising voluntary contributions from City
institutions, be appointed to act as mediator among the various parties and
set a six-month deadline for the parties to reach agreement.
The Department of Social Security called the report 'timely' and said
ministers had already expressed concern about the delay in returning funds
to the Maxwell Pension Schemes.
A Pounds 2.5m government 'drip feed' allocated to pay pensions last year is
shortly to be exhausted.
Mr Field said that in the past year, almost none of the Pounds 150m
recovered on behalf of pensioners had been distributed. In that time, Pounds
34.1m had been spent on solicitors, accountants and others charged with
recovering money. That sum might rise to Pounds 100m, he said.
The committee singled out for special criticism Mr Peter Phillips, partner
at Buchler Phillips and joint receiver to the estate of Mr Maxwell, whom it
accused of needlessly pursuing 'claims to property of a fanciful nature'.
Mr Field said the committee was drawing up a schedule of representatives of
investment banks, including Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, Bank of America,
Capel-Cure Myers and Invesco MIM to question how those banks came to be in
receipt of pension fund assets.
The banks had claimed they had received the assets in good faith as
collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Mr Field said that refunds to the
pension schemes might be forthcoming after those hearings.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: BR sell-off may take a decade -
Proposals for railway safety arrangements and pension provisions outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor announced more details of the government's rail
privatisation proposals yesterday, while appearing to acknowledge for the
first time that the process might take at least a decade to complete.
Using a Labour-initiated debate to refute recent charges of a rail
privatisation U-turn, the transport secretary undertook to implement all 38
recommendations in a Health and Safety Commission report published
yesterday, examining the safety implications of the government's plans.
Mr MacGregor also announced proposals for a joint industry pension scheme
for rail workers to succeed the British Rail arrangement.
He said: 'There is not a shred of a policy that is dead and buried and not a
shred of a U-turn in this.'
But in responding to taunts from Labour backbenchers of 'twelve years',
relating to the expected time frame of the recently announced German rail
privatisation, Mr MacGregor seemed to concede that reform of the railways in
Britain would also be a slow process.
'Our timescale to complete our whole privatisation process will be about the
same,' he replied.
The transport secretary declined Labour's invitation to give an assurance
that no lines would be closed as the proposed reforms took effect.
Mr MacGregor said BR's existing safety organisation would be maintained as a
unit and transferred to Railtrack, the proposed track authority. He said
Railtrack would also be responsible for providing a national timetable.
He said the planned joint pensions scheme should not be compulsory for
future industry employers for all time but future pension benefits should be
no less favourable than in the present scheme.
The portion of the current fund relating to railway pensioners would either
be set aside and administered separately with no guarantee as to future
benefit levels or taken over by the government, which would undertake to pay
index-linked pensions.
He undertook to publish the main privatisation bill 'just as soon as' the
paving legislation secured royal assent 'which I hope will be very soon.'
Mr Robert Adley, Tory chairman of the cross-party transport select
committee, criticised the government's plans on a number of counts, claiming
the bill was on 'a political timetable based on purely electoral
considerations.
He urged a plan which would end the freight monopoly, then the passenger
monopoly, then create integrated railway companies, and introduce private
sector capital and management, if appropriate.
A buoyant Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, opened proceedings
for Labour said privatisation would mean the doubling of fares.
The issue at stake was not ownership but the modernisation of the rail
system, he said, warning that the cost of the new bureaucracy would be paid
by sacking 'professional railwaymen desperately trying to provide a
service.'
A Labour motion opposing rail privatisation fell by 309 votes to 270, a
majority of 39.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM pledges pressure for Bosnia
settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night agreed to reinforce its 2,400-strong military
force in Bosnia in the event that the peace talks designed to end the
conflict in the former Yugoslav province again break down.
Mr John Major and senior ministers last night agreed in principle that the
ground troops - sent to support the United Nations humanitarian aid effort -
should be supported by further forces operating heavy artillery.
Officials refused to comment on their conclusions, which will be reported to
the full cabinet tomorrow. Downing Street suggested earlier that the
reinforcement would also include the despatch to the Adriatic of the
aircraft carrier Ark Royal.
A senior official from the prime minister's office said the aim was to
ensure that British troops remain secure once the United Nations agrees to
sanction military action to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia. Other
Whitehall officials said that ministers were also reviewing contingency
plans to evacuate the troops in the event of serious ground battles with
Serbian forces.
Earlier Mr Major warned publicly that further pressure would be applied by
the international community if the Bosnian Serbs rejected the peace formula
devised by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
Speaking in the Commons before the dramatic reversal by the Bosnian Serb
leader of his earlier rejection of a constitutional plan for Bosnia, the
prime minister said that sooner or later there would have to be a negotiated
settlement.
'The only question is whether that comes now or following further
repression, further suffering and further difficulties,' he insisted.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, underlined the concern caused by
a deliberate artillery attack, 'from what appears to have been Serbian
positions' on British troops fulfilling their humanitarian mission in the
area around Sarajevo.
He said: 'We are giving urgent consideration as to what should be the proper
response to ensure the fullest protection for our forces.'
Anxiety was expressed from the Tory backbenches about the escalating dangers
facing British troops, and Mr Peter Viggers (C Gosport) underlined the risk
that UN forces might end up being 'the fourth side in a civil war'.
He urged that the option of withdrawing British troops if they continued to
come under fire should be kept open.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges oil tanker ban as
Braer breaks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, called on the government yesterday to ban
oil tankers using routes close to environmentally sensitive areas around
Britain's coastline until the cause of the Braer disaster had been
established.
Amid mounting concern about the extent of the environmental and economic
damage inflicted on the Shetland Islands as the wrecked vessel broke up, he
insisted that the practice followed by aviation authorities when serious
accidents occurred should also apply to oil tankers.
To Labour cheers, Mr Smith emphasised that it was customary for aircraft to
be grounded pending the outcome of accident inquiries.
Such interim action should also be available in respect of oil tankers in
view of the 'acute anxiety' around Britain's coastline resulting from the
damage caused to the Shetland Islands by the Braer disaster.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised to consult Mr John MacGregor,
the transport secretary, about Mr Smith's proposal.
When Labour MPs demanded 'action now', he said the proposal had many
ramifications which needed to be examined before a concrete answer could be
provided. Mr Smith pressed the prime minister to involve himself in the
matter and not leave it to Mr MacGregor.
Mr Major said Mr MacGregor would report to him and 'we will report back to
the House'.
The battle to salvage anything from the stricken tanker was finally lost
yesterday as it became clear that overnight the ship had broken into three
sections in continued battering by near-hurricane-force winds.
Most of the remaining oil on the ship, which was carrying 84,000 tonnes of
light crude when it went aground near Sumburgh Head early last week, has
spilled out since the ship's tanks suffered further serious damage on
Monday.
The oil does not appear to have spread far from the wreck, though, and is
either being confined along the shore by storm force winds or dispersing
rapidly in ferocious waves.
The European Commission yesterday approved more than Ecu 1m (Pounds 800,000)
of emergency aid to help the Shetland Islands and their inhabitants recover
from the aftermath of the oil spill.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: New regulations on 'policy' adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVERTISING by central government and local authorities will for the first
time be subject to a self-regulatory code of practice, the Advertising
Standards Authority said yesterday.
Regulations covering the advertising industry will be expanded to include
public policy statements, but the ASA has stopped short of scrutinising
'advertisements whose principal function is party-political' for honesty and
truthfulness.
The decision was criticised yesterday by the Labour party and the Trades
Union Congress. Mr David Hill, Labour's director of communications, said the
code should cover advertising such as the Conservative campaign during last
year's general election which highlighted what it called Labour's 'tax
bombshell'.
The TUC, which drew up a submission for the revised code, said the new rules
were 'inconsistent'.
Sir Timothy Raison, chairman of the ASA, said yesterday it had decided to
exclude direct party political advertising from the code of practice
because:
Political parties are involved in appealing to the electorate and Sir
Timothy questioned whether the ASA should 'have the right to judge those
appeals'.
There was already scope for a right of reply by opposing parties.
The practicalities of the political arena would make it difficult for the
ASA to intervene with sufficient speed.
Mr Richard Wade, outgoing director-general of the Advertising Association
and chairman of the ASA committee that drew up the extended code, said
yesterday: 'We started out by wanting all political advertising brought
within the code, but came to the view that party political advertisements
are different in kind.'
Advertisements promoting government policy - such as those from the Central
Office of Information, one of the UK's largest-spending advertisers - will
fall under the new rules.
The expanded regulations, which come into effect on April 15, will also
cover charities, lobbying groups, trade unions and other advertisers
expressing opinions on issues in the public domain. Previously, the code
excluded such advertising unless it made a direct appeal for funds.
Advertising claims made by non-commercial bodies will now have to be
supported by documentary evidence to back up facts, figures and assertions
used in support of their causes.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confusion over newspaper VAT plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's intentions towards the extension of value added tax were
shrouded in confusion last night after a Treasury minister gave an apparent
pledge not to end the zero-rating on newspapers.
In a letter to Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat MP, Sir John Cope said
he could assure him the government 'has no present plans or proposals to
extend the scope of VAT to newspapers'. Sir John added: 'I hope that this
helps to clarify the position.'
The unusually reassuring tone of the letter prompted Mr Carlile to claim
that the government had now ended weeks of speculation by making a
'categorical assurance' that newspapers would retain their present
zero-rating.
But amid some embarrassment at the Treasury, officials later claimed that
the letter had done nothing to narrow Mr Norman Lamont's options for his
Budget in March.
The letter, dated January 6 1993, had been written before Mr Lamont began
his official Budget preparations at a meeting in Chevening two days later.
Any subsequent Treasury replies would include a standard statement that no
comment could be made on possible tax measures ahead of the Budget.
There was private acknowledgement, though, that Sir John's letter - framed
months earlier in the light of the commitments given by Mr John Major in the
general election campaign - would create political embarrassment for the
government if the chancellor did choose to raise additional tax revenue at
the expense of the newspapers.
Mr Lamont will today give Mr Major the broad conclusions of his discussions
in Chevening, setting out the option of extending VAT to areas such as
domestic fuel and transport as well as to newspapers and books.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Part-time work for managers increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PART-time work is making inroads into managerial jobs and seven out of 10
private-sector companies have at least one part-time manager, according to a
survey published yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants.
Part-time work has traditionally been concentrated in junior service-sector
jobs. Of the 5.7m part-timers in the UK, only 2.3 per cent (136,000 people)
are classified as managers. If public-sector professionals (mainly teachers)
are included, the proportion rises to 7.6 per cent, still low compared with
some Continental countries.
The survey of more than 100 companies found that the trend is growing,
especially among women managers with children in service-sector businesses
in the south-east. The survey says employers have found that productivity
gains and savings from the retention of trained staff makes employment of
flexible managers a 'good deal' for them.
It also finds plenty of scope for more part-time work among managers, but
warns that part-timers are less likely to be promoted. Job sharing, where
two managers share responsibilities, is comparatively rare. Most employers
and managers prefer individuals in self-contained jobs to work between two
and four days a week.
Two and three-day patterns are more common in retailing, while general
services financial services and hotels use part-time managers most.
There are more than twice as many women part-time managers as men, with most
men concentrated in the 65-69 age group and in the financial services
sector. Many women do not have children - 54,000, compared with 76,000 who
do.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Hatton denies charges of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK HATTON, the former Labour deputy leader of Liverpool City Council,
yesterday pleaded not guilty to three charges of conspiracy to defraud the
local authority.
Appearing at the preliminary hearing of a trial that might last six months,
Mr Hatton denied the charges before Mr Justice Waterhouse began the process
of selecting a jury at Mold Crown Court, north Wales.
Mr Hatton and his four co-defendants were asked to plead to amended charges
of conspiracy to defraud the local authority over two Liverpool carpark
sites and the site of a cinema complex in the city.
Mr Hatton and the four other defendants - former councillors Ms Hannah Folan
and Mr John Nelson; Mr John Monk, Mr Hatton's personal tailor; and Mr Roy
Stewart, managing director of Rogersons Developments - all denied the
charges against them.
The court was told that legal argument might last for the next four days.
The trial is expected to start on Monday.
Mr Justice Waterhouse warned the jury: 'If any of you have been involved in
dealings with Liverpool City Council or concerned in the business of
Liverpool City Council it is obviously undesirable that you should serve on
the jury.'

FT  13 JAN 93 / House price fall accelerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices fell 4.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year following
the reimposition of stamp duty on house purchases and Britain's exit from
the exchange rate mechanism, Halifax Building Society said yesterday.
Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said in its quarterly index that
prices fell much faster in the last quarter than in the previous two. It
said much of the fall came in September as buyers' confidence was damaged by
the devaluation and the reimposition of stamp duty.
The biggest quarterly fall came in the East Midlands, where house prices
fell by 7 per cent. In the south-east, prices fell 5.9 per cent, taking the
fall in the average house price in the region to Pounds 31,800 in the past
three years.
In the year to December, UK house prices fell 7.8 per cent on average,
compared with a fall of 3.5 per cent in the same period of 1991 and a rise
of 0.5 per cent in 1990. The peak of house prices nationally was in July
1989.
The Halifax said house prices in East Anglia were now almost a third down on
the region's peak level in the fourth quarter of 1988, while prices in the
rest of the south had fallen to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent below
the peak.
The society said that although the housing market remained weak in the
fourth quarter, there had been evidence of more interest towards the end of
the year as prices became more affordable.
It said the increase in interest should be reflected in higher numbers of
house purchases this year, which would also be boosted by a more general
increase in confidence as the economy started to grow again.
It predicted that house prices would stabilise in the spring and then show
some increase in the second half of the year, giving way to a sustained
recovery next year.
The society's Halifax Property Services estate agency subsidiary said that
most agents had been 'pleasantly surprised' by business in December.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Industry squeezed as input costs rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES OF raw materials and fuels rose again last month as the devaluation
of sterling continued to put upward pressure on manufacturers' costs.
Input prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in December, a smaller
month-on-month rise than expected. Compared with a year ago, prices rose 5.2
per cent, the highest rate of increase since 1979. Before September - when
sterling was devalued - raw material and fuel prices were falling.
The sharp jump in input price inflation since autumn has not yet led to a
corresponding increase in output prices.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that, in December, prices
of goods leaving the factory gates rose by 0.2 per cent, taking the annual
rate of output price inflation to 3.5 per cent - compared with 3.3 per cent
in the year to November. That suggests that manufacturers are reluctant to
pass the higher input costs on to consumers. Raw materials and fuels account
for about 40 per cent of expenditure.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburgs, said output prices were being
held down by sluggish unit wage costs. The latest figures from the
Department of Employment show they rose by only 1 per cent in the three
months to the end of October. 'It is going to take a while for the latest
cost increases in raw materials to come through,' Mr Gardiner said. 'Output
prices are being held at bay by unit wage costs that are going nowhere.'
The underlying rate of output price inflation, excluding volatile food,
drink and tobacco prices, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in
December compared with the previous month, and 2.4 per cent in the year to
December. That was unchanged from the November figure.
The latest monthly increase in input prices of 0.1 per cent followed much
bigger rises in October and November, when they rose by 2.2 per cent and 2.5
per cent respectively.
Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said December's figure
was a brief respite for input prices: 'Dollar-denominated commodity prices
now appear to be moving upwards after the excessive deflation of the past
year.'

FT  13 JAN 93 / Foreign companies report easier staff recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the 450-plus foreign companies that have moved into the Yorkshire
and Humberside area appear to be finding it easier to recruit managerial,
professional and skilled staff than their homegrown competitors, a survey
released yesterday says.
They have also carried on investing throughout the recession and many have
created jobs. More than 90 per cent say productivity is 'excellent' and has
increased in recent years. Further investment is planned by 95 per cent of
them during the next 18 months.
The survey of inward investors' workforces was carried out by Acas, the
conciliation service, for the Yorkshire and Humberside Development
Association.
The region has about 200 north American companies, 80 from Germany, more
than 40 from Sweden, 40 from France, 35 from Switzerland and nearly 30 from
the Far East. Between them they employ 50,000 people.
Only one in five of the 100 foreign companies surveyed said there was poor
availability of managers, technical and skilled labour. Similar figures from
all companies in the area are usually higher - sometimes by more than twice
as much. Such surveys have also shown falling investment and few plans to
increase it. The number of companies seeking graduate recruits during the
'milk round' at universities is likely to fall sharply this year, according
to the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services.
Almost 30 per cent fewer companies will attend this year's spring round of
presentations to students, the association said yesterday. The survey of 77
higher-education institutions found a drop of 5 per cent in the number of
companies attending the smaller autumn round last year, mainly because
accountancy firms reported an overall 20 per cent fall in vacancies.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Safety mechanisms at Sizewell B n-power station may need
strengthening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFETY mechanisms at the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk might
need strengthening because of doubts over the efficiency of a computerised
fault-detection system, according to the British Computer Society, David
Green writes.
The primary protection system for the plant, which is due to start
generating electricity next year, involves 300 microprocessors and 98,000
lines of computer code.
The society says it doubts whether the existing programme of testing will
prove the efficiency of the system because of its complexity and it is
suggesting that either the testing programme or the secondary protection
system should be enhanced.
The society has made seven recommendations it wants Nuclear Electric, the
state-owned nuclear power generator, to carry out before the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate approves the system. Nuclear Electric said
yesterday that the existing test programme was capable of demonstrating the
efficiency of the primary system and there would be no need to enhance the
secondary system.

FT  13 JAN 93 / West Midlands business confidence at new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER West Midlands companies expect to take on more workers over the next
six months than at any time since the start of the recession, a survey of
1,200 businesses has disclosed.
The survey, by Wolverhampton and Warwick business schools and accountants
Price Waterhouse, published today, shows a sharp drop in business confidence
and a marked change in corporate attitudes towards government policy.
Concern about keeping down inflation has been replaced by estimates for
increased government expenditure coupled with lower interest rates to
provide new economic impetus.
Expectations for jobs go together with gloomy predictions about business
conditions. The latest survey shows that 56 per cent of companies expect
conditions to deteriorate over the next six months. Only 13 per cent expect
them to improve.
A third of companies expected to take on more labour last summer: that
proportion has dropped to 16 per cent. Over the past six months, 45 per cent
of companies have reduced their workforce, more than three times as many as
had expected to do during the summer.
Manufacturing was affected worst by the recession in its early stages, while
services remained buoyant.
Now, the survey says: 'The service sector is starting to experience the
employment shedding which has been taking place in the manufactur-ing sector
for some time.'
Recent analysis of official figures by the West Midlands Enterprise Board
showed that people out of work for more than a year made up 40 per cent of
the total jobless in Birmingham, the Black Country and Coventry.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Businesses confident that economy will start to recover in
1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BUSINESSES are confident that the economy will start to recover in the
first half of this year, but business failures will remain at a high level,
Emma Tucker writes.
A survey by Lloyds Bank and forecasts for business failures from Trade
Indemnity, the independent credit insurance group, gave mixed signals on the
outlook for the economy yesterday.
The survey from Lloyds, which covered almost 1,500 businesses in
manufacturing and services, shows a sharp variation in optimism by region
and industry.
London and the south-east have the highest expectations, as does the north
of England. The Midlands is relatively pessimistic.
Trade Indemnity is forecasting total business failures of 1,780 for the
final quarter of 1992, 1 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. That
would bring the total number of failures for 1992 to about 7,525 compared
with 7,807 in 1991. The outlook for this year is for a further decline of
about 10 per cent.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Trouble in store for nuclear waste processor: The debate
over BNFL's Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuel's unpublished report to the government claims that up
to Pounds 200m a year of overseas revenues would be lost in the next 10
years if its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant were abandoned, with a total cost to
the UK of more than Pounds 900m.
The quarter-mile plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which has taken nearly 10
years to build and is ready to start operation, is designed to reprocess
'spent' or used fuel from nuclear reactors in the UK and overseas into
reusable plutonium and uranium, with a smaller amount of waste.
Since the plant received the go-ahead from the 1977 Windscale inquiry, the
environmental, economic and political arguments for reprocessing have
changed, leading to fierce debate about whether Thorp should start
operation. Without Thorp, state-owned BNFL has little long-term future. It
has been anxious to argue in recent months that cancellation would also be a
loss.
Its claims are based on a complex model commissioned from consultants Touche
Ross, which weighs up Thorp's costs in the first decade of operation against
loss of revenue and extra expense if Thorp were abandoned.
According to the model - which BNFL has refused to publish on grounds of
customer confidentiality but which has been seen by the Financial Times -
cancellation would cost the UK nearly Pounds 2bn in lost overseas income
over the next 13 years.
BNFL has said customers have signed contracts worth Pounds 9bn, but
according to the model those in the the first decade are worth only Pounds
6bn. Of that, foreign customers represent some Pounds 4bn, mainly Japanese
and German, but also Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and
Canada. They have paid about Pounds 2bn in advance, which BNFL has spent on
building Thorp.
The model has no provision for repaying that money if Thorp were cancelled.
The model also estimates that if customers pull out or reduced shipments
they would have to compensate BNFL fully. Environmentalists suggested
recently that the Germans and Japanese are less committed to reprocessing
than in the past - a claim BNFL rejects.
A second politically controversial point, should Thorp be cancelled, is the
fate of the several thousand tonnes of fuel from overseas customers stored
at Sellafield. Thorp's critics have argued that the countries may be
unwilling to have it returned. The report assumes that the costs of storing
it would be Pounds 15m a year for most of the next decade. The costs of
transporting it back would be millions of pounds a year more.
The model shows that if the plant were cancelled, the UK would save - it
estimates that Thorp's operating costs will range from Pounds 120m to Pounds
170m a year in 1993 prices over the next decade, comprising the wages of the
1,200 staff, energy for heating, and acid needed to fill pipes.
The UK would save the costs of eventually decommissioning the plant, which
becomes radioactive as soon as it starts operating. In its audited accounts,
BNFL puts the decommissioning costs of the central Thorp plant at Pounds
750m. The model says Pounds 70m of that has already been incurred because
4,000 tonnes of fuel from customers has contaminated the storage ponds.
Economists and environmentalists yesterday attacked many of the assumptions
behind the Touche Ross conclusion of an overall Pounds 900m loss to the UK.
They argued the figure would be lower if:
Decommissioning costs rose.
Some operating costs rose. Customer contracts for the first decade are
believed to allow BNFL to pass on increases, but in some cases customers
might challenge that, for example where costs have been caused by delay in
starting Thorp.
Foreign customers pulled out or reduced shipments and challenged their
obligation to repay BNFL in the courts.
Storage costs for unprocessed fuel proved cheaper than BNFL's assumptions.
A higher discount rate than the model's 8 per cent was used to reflect
higher risk. A figure of around 8 per cent is standard in Treasury models of
state-owned companies, but lower than rates typically used in commercial
projections.
Mr Willian Walker, of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University,
said: 'Touche Ross seem to have assumed either that Thorp starts and runs at
full capacity or it doesn't start. But I believe that if it goes ahead it
could prove very difficult to send plutonium and waste back to overseas
customers for political reasons, and Thorp would have to keep storing it -
who knows what those costs would be?' He added: 'The decommissioning costs,
and the costs of the ultimate storage of reprocessed waste are drawn from
the air - no one knows with any precision'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR in 10 Britons feel less financially secure than they did two years ago,
according to a survey published yesterday. The main reasons cited are fear
of unemployment and the effect of increased prices on those with low
incomes.
The Mori survey, conducted for the insurance company Scottish Amicable, also
found that Britons felt less financially secure than the French or Germans.
Mori interviewed 2,017 adults in Britain, 1,000 in France and 1,028 in
Germany. The interviews were conducted in September.

<TEXT>
BIFU, THE banking union, called a second one-day strike of its 19,000
members in branches of TSB Retail Banking and Insurance yesterday, and said
there might be separate lightning strikes in TSB computer centres.
The one-day strike called for January 22 follows what the union claimed was
a successful one-day strike in the TSB's branch network last Friday.
Bifu said it had agreed with TSB to cancel negotiating meetings scheduled
for this week to discuss issues including the annual pay round. It said it
was willing to talk to the bank about the dispute at the Acas conciliation

<TEXT>
BIFU, the banking union, called a second one-day strike of its 19,000
members in branches of TSB Retail Banking and Insurance yesterday, and said
there might be separate lightning strikes in TSB computer centres.
The one-day strike called for January 22 follows what the union claimed was
a successful one-day strike in the TSB's branch network last Friday. The
strike stopped cheque clearing and closed at least 366 branches.
The delay until the next strike allows time for the union and the bank to
resume negotiations over 840 redundancies - some of them compulsory  -
caused by the merger of TSB's branch banking and insurance sales operations.
Bifu said it had agreed with TSB to cancel negotiating meetings scheduled
for this week to discuss issues including the annual pay round. It said it
was willing to talk to the bank about the dispute at the Acas conciliation
service.
Mr John Townsend, Bifu assistant secretary, said the union believed it could
achieve a better response from its members than last time because the delay
allowed it more time to organise action in the TSB's 1,369 branches.
He added that the union might call action at short notice in TSB's five
computer centres and two cheque clearing centres.
TSB disclosed its own estimates of the effect of action on Friday, which
were disputed by the union. TSB said 1,003 of its branches had remained
open, and computer operations and cash machines had operated as normal.
The union said TSB's estimate of branches that remained open during the
strike included those which were staffed by a single manager. The union
added that about half the bank's branches had been either wholly closed, or
were opened by a manager.
TSB said that it was willing to negotiate with Bifu over the redundancies at
any time, and it hoped the union would approach any talks 'in a constructive
manner'. The bank added that it regretted that further industrial action had
been called.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Fewer groups seek graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of companies seeking graduate recruits during the 'milk round' at
universities is likely to fall sharply this year, according to the
Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, Catherine Milton writes.
Almost 30 per cent fewer companies will attend this year's spring round of
presentations to students, the association said yesterday. The survey of 77
higher-education institutions found a drop of 5 per cent in the number of
companies attending the smaller autumn round last year, mainly because
accountancy firms reported an overall 20 per cent fall in vacancies.
Overall demand for graduates last year was down 14 per cent on 1991,
according to a separate survey published by the Association of Graduate
Recruiters. The survey, of 304 recruiting organisations, was conducted by
the Institute of Manpower Studies.

FT  13 JAN 93 / US warning as Iraq taunts allies: Missile alert and third
incursion into Kuwait prompt threats from west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US delivered a strong warning to Iraq yesterday over its tactic of
'going to the brink' as President Saddam Hussein continued to taunt the
United Nations and western allies.
The threat to Baghdad was echoed last night by the president of the UN
Security Council, Mr Yoshio Hatano of Japan, who said after a meeting with
Iraq's ambassador to the UN that he was losing his patience.
The Iraqi ambassador, Mr Nizar Hamdoon, said after handing over a letter to
Mr Hatano that Baghdad wanted to defuse the crisis by discussing a range of
issues with the Security Council.
However, Baghdad had no specific proposals and Mr Hatano said there had been
no mention at the meeting of an intention to open a dialogue.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Saddam changed the status of surface-to-air missiles
to operational in the northern air exclusion zone and, for the third
consecutive day, sent men across the border into Kuwait.
General John Shalikashvili, US supreme allied commander of Nato forces in
Europe, described Iraq's behaviour over the past few days as brinkmanship.
He warned that Baghdad could provoke a 'dangerous accident' by changing the
status of SA-2 and SA-3 missiles north of the 36th parallel where only
non-operational missiles are allowed.
Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, said on Monday that Iraq had resumed
moving missiles in and out of the southern no-fly zone.
Mr Hamdoon said he was worried about a US attack but saw no way to prevent
such action.
Iraqi had also ignored the Security Council's condemnation on Monday of
incursions across the newly demarcated border into Kuwait. Mr Hatano said he
had told Mr Hamdoon that, in view of this condemnation, the council took
'very seriously' the continued removal yesterday by about 150 Iraqis of
warehouses and equipment near the port of Umm Qasr.
The UN has demanded the return of missiles and other military equipment
removed by 500 Iraqis from four weapons bunkers on Sunday.
In Britain, Downing Street said its impatience with Iraq was growing and
that further defiance of UN resolutions would be met by 'whatever action is
deemed necessary - and that includes military action'.
Officials recognise that Iraq is testing the UK, US and other allies with
small-scale incursions into Kuwait. But Downing Street signalled that any
reaction need not be proportionate to individual violations and could
reflect the cumulative impact of a succession of 'flea-bites'.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, repeated that the Iraqis would
get no further warnings. 'They cannot continue to violate UN resolutions and
there is a clear pattern to the violation, whether it is missiles or these
raids into warehouses, or other actions they have taken. It remains to be
seen what may come of that but, as we said, there will be no warnings.'
Mr Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said the US had the ability to take
action, if called upon to do so.
Newspapers in Baghdad said that western military forces would not deter Iraq
from challenging the restrictions imposed by the allies.
The two no-fly zones were created by the allies in the aftermath of the Gulf
war. The zone north of the 36th parallel was set up in 1991 to protect the
Kurdish population.
This was followed last August by one south of the 32nd parallel designed to
give the Shia population some relief against attacks by Baghdad forces
seeking to quell the remnants of the 1991 rebellion.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Minister warns of 'electronic pollution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ELECTROMAGNETIC pollution' can kill, a UK industry minister warned
yesterday.
Mr Edward Leigh, trade and technology minister, has not been converted to
the controversial theory that electric fields, for example from power lines,
directly damage human health. But spelled out a catalogue of accidents
caused by radiation leaking from electrical and communications equipment and
interfering with sensitive electronic components.
The minister was launching a campaign to help companies satisfy a new
European Community directive on 'electromagnetic compatibility'. Among the
disasters he listed were: A UK worker died when a computer-controlled crane
dropped its load prematurely.
In Japan, robots went out of control and killed two human operators in a
robotics factory. In Germany, anti-lock braking mechanisms suddenly came
into operation on cars speeding along an autobahn as a result of
interference from a powerful radio transmitter five miles away.
Mr Leigh said the EC directive was intended both to remove technical trade
barriers and as an environmental measure to combat 'electronic smog'. Every
electrical and electronics manufacturer will have to ensure that its
products meet strict limits on electromagnetic interference.
The complex rules become mandatory in January 1996. For the next three
years, as the electronics and communications industries continue to grow,
European governments are hoping that voluntary compliance will prevent the
electronic smog becoming any more dense.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Treasury to forge business links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 100 top officials at the Treasury have been told to spend at least one
day a year visiting industry as part of a scheme by Sir Terry Burns,
Treasury permanent secretary, to build better links with business.
The programme is starting after widespread criticism of Britain's top
government department for being too remote from industry and failing to
understand the forces behind Britain's longest recession for 60 years.
The notion of Treasury awaydays was received enthusiastically by some of
Britain's biggest companies, although a few businesses said the scheme did
not go far enough.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, said: 'It's
an excellent way to foster better relationships. Treasury officials will be
welcome to come to Dixons and get their hands grubby.'
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of the food manufacturer Northern Foods,
said: 'Any effort by Treasury officials to leave the isolated cocoon in
which they live is to be applauded.'
Sir Terry launched his proposals without publicity just before Christmas, On
top of the industry visits, the 100 top officials have been told to arrange
at least three annual 'contacts' - such as lunches  - with industrial
representatives.
The scheme - which will encourage outings to factories, as opposed to
commercial offices - is expected to lead to a substantial increase in
Treasury meetings with industry. The Treasury said the scheme was intended
to make officials 'better informed' about business, particularly
manufacturing.
Mr Neil Gracey, employee services manager at chemical company Associated
Octel, welcomed the plan but said it was 'too little, too late'. Mr Paul
Lester, chief executive of Graseby, the electronics group, said: 'One day a
year is not enough.'
The Treasury yesterday hosted the first meeting of its new panel of private
sector forecasters which will report next month on the medium-term economic
outlook. The seven-member panel is to meet again on February 9 after a
discussion yesterday, mainly about the procedures to be adopted in
assembling the report.

FT  13 JAN 93 / SIB warning for investment body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, NORMA COHEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Personal Investment Authority has been told by the Securities and
Investments Board that it will not receive authorisation to become the new
super-regulator of retail financial businesses unless it can prove it will
radically improve the regulation of the market.
A confidential letter from Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, to Sir Gordon
Downey, chairman of the authority, says the board wants a 'step change in
regulatory standards across the whole marketplace'. If the authority is
unable to deliver the necessary improvements, SIB warns, 'we will look to
other ways of achieving them'.
The letter represents the toughest action to date by Mr Large to try to
improve standards of financial regulation since he became SIB chairman last
summer.
Senior life insurance and financial services company officials warned
yesterday that SIB's tough stance might make it impossible for the PIA to be
formed as the regulator, because of opposition from the financial industry.
'This is the end of the PIA,' said one member of the authority's formation
committee.
The authority is intended to be formed by the merger of two self-regulatory
organisations - Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for
financial intermediaries. As the letter says, it is intended to be the lead
regulator for firms selling 'life, pensions and unit trust products'.
Mr Large says: 'We now need to deliver a higher standard of investor
protection in this market place than has been possible hitherto.' The
seven-page letter sets out detailed conditions the authority must meet if it
is to gain SIB approval. The letter emphasises the authority cannot
automatically accept all members of Lautro and Fimbra, saying: 'SIB expects
members of the PIA to be subjected to a rigorous assessment of fitness,
properness and financial standing.'
The process of vetting the potential 7,000 members must start now and ought
to be largely completed by the middle of the year, SIB says. SIB also says
the authority must demonstrate that it will have the resources for improved
monitoring of retail financial businesses and for more effective enforcement
of rules governing the industry.
'We are looking for a substantial commitment of top-quality resources and it
is obvious that this will be expensive,' the letter says. 'SIB is aware that
this will be unwelcome to PIA members, particularly the smaller ones.'
The letter also criticises the authority's proposal to have a board of 30
directors. It says that number should be halved.
In response to complaints from consumer groups that the authority would put
the interests of financial firms above those of investors, the SIB says that
a majority of the PIA's board members should be 'public-interest directors'
rather than representatives of the financial industry.
The SIB has responded to consumer complaints in a second respect. It is
insisting that the authority unify its procedures for handling complaints
from the public immediately, rather than continuing to operate the existing
complaints procedures of Fimbra and Lautro in tandem.
The Consumers' Association welcomed the letter's position on public-interest
directors and on the tough procedures for admitting members to the
authority.
However, Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumer Association's money group,
criticised Mr Large's vision of the scope of the authority for not including
mortgages and deposit-based products.

FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Commerzbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be too much to expect a German bank to consider shareholders when
launching a rights issue. That yesterday's DM500m Commerzbank offering
includes no earnings forecast, though 1992 has closed, is about par for the
course. One has to hope last year's figures contain no nasty surprises on
provisions, despite the bank's large exposure to the likes of Russia,
Olympia &amp; York and Hafnia. Even so, the timing raises questions both about
the urgency of the bank's need for capital and its perception of its share
price.
Commerzbank has long been the least well capitalised of the big three German
banks. After the issue it will have a tier one ratio of 4.5 per cent - too
tight for comfort for the tougher version of Germany's new capital
requirements. It does allow some latitude under the alternative - which
Commerzbank has chosen - whereby a minimum tier one ratio of 4 per cent is
acceptable at banks prepared to refrain from using valuation reserves to
meet their tier two obligations.
Under this formula the need for capital was present but less urgent, so the
bank seems to have picked its moment carefully. Commerzbank's shares have
climbed some 12 per cent since last September's low. Perhaps the bank is
hinting that they may not rise much further even when the Bundesbank starts
cutting rates. By then recession will be hitting with a vengeance and,
though banks are normally interest sensitive stocks, investor attention will
turn to losses on domestic lending. Other banks will be in the same boat.
Paradoxically Commerzbank may not be the worst affected. It is already on a
low rating and has been boosting its operating return. The rest have yet to
disappoint.

FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The odds seem stacked against Italy's privatisation programme raising much
enthusiasm abroad. On a gloomy view of the cycle, the government has chosen
a poor time to offer up its industrial assets. The complexity of the state
holding companies and the restructuring required to knock them into shape
hardly promise a smooth transition to the private sector. Since the
government soaks up the lion's share of domestic savings, attracting
overseas investors could be more than a matter of convenience. All the more
reason for the government not to shirk the issue of majority control.
Concern over the treatment of minority shareholders extends beyond Italy.
Few investors would want a minority stake in any company viewed as
strategically important by government. But the experience of creditors to
Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last July,
has left the international financial community especially suspicious of the
Italian public sector.
Outright trade sales of the smaller and juicier assets - such as ENI's
mechanical engineering side - should go well enough. However, the jury is
out on the next stage of the process until the government has declared a
firm policy on golden share holdings and the like. If the government really
wants international support, it must convince investors that it is after the
wider benefits of privatisation rather than just the cash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After two months of worryingly sharp rises, December's producer price
figures show that the upward pressures on industry's raw material costs
appear to be abating. With fingers firmly crossed, the Treasury cites this
as evidence that sterling's depreciation has done its worst to input prices.
Doubters will retort that the full effects of devaluation take time to
materialise, but the crucial question will be how soon the recent spurt in
industry's input costs feeds through at the factory gate. This seems likely
to be a slow, if inexorable, process. Yesterday's figures on output prices
show the pressure is not yet that great. Slowing labour cost increases may
be helping to stall the inflationary impetus. In addition, although recent
CBI surveys suggest companies are itching to raise prices to restore
margins, they will find it hard to do so while demand remains weak. This
must cast further doubts over the prospects for improved corporate
profitability.
The good news is that the chancellor appears for a while at least to have a
touch more leeway than previously in contemplating further interest rate
cuts. He may find the going harder in the summer if UK inflation is picking
up and his targets are under threat. With the Bundesbank cutting rates by
then he would need determination to take an opposite line.

FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Whisky sours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However much Guinness protests that its rationalisation is prompted by
internal efficiency considerations, it is clearly a sign of excess capacity
in the whisky market. Bulk prices weakened in the second half of 1992, and
expectations of other distillers' profits are falling. Perhaps the only
consolation is that conditions are not as bad as in the early 1980s. Prices,
though, may remain soft for some time, particularly at the commodity end of
the market, and there will be knock-on effects to Guinness' premium
products.
So it is unfortunate Guinness' efficiency measures will not bear substantial
fruit until 1995. Worldwide recession is curbing consumption of spirits and
slowing the drift to upmarket brands, dulling Guinness' profits growth. Even
when recession lifts, low inflation may limit the ability of distillers to
raise their margins as they did in the 1980s. The glamour of whisky may just
be souring slightly.
Yet despite the immediate below-average earnings outlook, Guinness' strong
market position and capable management can justify its rating in line with
the market, so the risks are limited. Equally, the tactic of waiting until
late in the day to squeeze the provision into last year's figures should at
least ensure the charge is quickly forgotten.
Guinness' cut in grain distilling capacity also casts an interesting
sidelight on another drinks fight. Invergordon's grain distillery attracted
Whyte &amp; MacKay's interest in 1991. The softness of the whisky market might
be expected to deter a bid, but, with reduced capacity in the industry,
Whyte may be tempted to exploit the weakness and return with a lower renewed
lower bid later in the year. The Invergordon board could then have missed
the best price.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Patten's progress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST OCTOBER'S proposals to widen Hong Kong's democratic base by Mr Chris
Patten, the governor, angered China's hardline communists. They demanded
complete withdrawal. Mr Patten then challenged Beijing to suggest a better
framework for the 1995 Legislative Council (LegCo) elections. This fruitless
exchange left Hong Kong people, who will fall under Chinese sovereignty in
1997, worried about their future. China's threats and hostility seemed to
put at risk the 'one country, two systems' principle which they had been
promised.
But Mr Patten's proposals have had another effect. They have sparked
precisely the kind of political debate in Hong Kong which, presumably,
Beijing abhors. This healthy development may offer a way forward.
Mr Patten has repeatedly said he can only go as far as the people of Hong
Kong want him to. For him personally, this approach offers a political
escape route - he does not need to go down with the ship of his proposals.
But it also means that Hong Kong's legislators have to assume the higher
degree of responsibility for Hong Kong's future that greater democracy
implies. If democracy is to mean anything, disagreements must provoke a
public debate which can change things.
Such debate is now under way in Hong Kong and may well produce workable
alternatives to Mr Patten's proposals. The time for deliberation has been
extended by the decision of the Executive Council, Mr Patten's appointed
advisory body, to spend the next month discussing the issue. Then the
governor's proposals, amended or not, will go to LegCo, which will also
debate them at length. Suggestions for amendments have begun to emerge. The
leading conservative faction on LegCo says it will table amendments
withdrawing the elements most objectionable to China. Ranged against it are
those who back Mr Patten's proposals as the best they are likely to be
offered.
The battle-lines are still rudimentary. The essential point is that debate
within Hong Kong is under way on determining the colony's future. This is
the best guarantee of the 'one country, two systems' approach and thus the
one most likely to maintain business confidence. It would not necessarily be
easy for China to scrap electoral arrangements determined by the Hong Kong
people after it took over - and it might not even want to.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Quiet coup at the Linoleum Palace: Reforms are under way at
the Treasury, but some critics believe they do not go far enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under attack for being too isolated, the UK's most important government
department, the Treasury, yesterday took the unusual step of opening its
doors to outsiders. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser,
presided over the first meeting of its new forecasting panel of seven
private-sector economists.
The meeting is part of a more widespread exercise in engineering an open
debate on how the government reaches decisions on economic policy and on how
to improve them. 'The panel is a rare opportunity to have a structured
public debate about the economy,' said one member, Professor Wynne Godley of
Cambridge University. 'The creative possibilities are enormous.'
Some critics complain the moves towards openness are largely cosmetic. Even
so, nobody can dispute the number of initiatives set up by the Treasury in
the wake of its recent misjudgments about the UK economy and Britain's exit
from the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
Today, the Treasury is to issue the second in its new series of monthly
monetary reports, which are supposed to shed more light on its thinking in
areas such as interest rates and inflation - until now a mostly secret
process.
In recent months the Treasury, which besides controlling interest rates also
has the final say on public spending and tax policy, has set up a panel of
representatives from big companies, which meets three times a year to give
the department views about economic trends.
Reacting to criticism that the Treasury has an inadequate understanding of
business, Sir Terry Burns, the department's permanent secretary, last year
called in Mr Howard Davies, the former Treasury official who is now
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, to advise on ways
to foster more contacts with the outside world. Sir Terry has since
instructed his top 100 Treasury officials to spend at least a day a year
visiting British companies.
The Treasury has also indicated it wants to attract more outsiders to work
within the department on a part-time basis. One example is Professor Charles
Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics, who is working at the
department for a day a week and said his role would be 'in-house academic'.
The Treasury - dubbed the Linoleum Palace by irreverent outsiders - is a
stimulating place for an academic to work. Such is the range of issues it
deals with that many areas of activity in the UK, from buying houses to the
design of nuclear missiles, are influenced to some degree by Treasury
policies.
Partly because of this range of responsibilities, the department is often
the butt of criticism from groups that feel their views have been left
ignored. Though the most important decisions are taken by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, much of the power rests with often-anonymous Treasury
officials.
In the past year, critics from industry, the City and other government
departments have become more vociferous. That has been mainly because of the
Treasury's failures in monitoring the recession and its lack of preparedness
for the currency storm which swept Britain out of the ERM.
Many business leaders are perturbed by the Treasury's recent poor record. Mr
Clive Thompson, chief executive at the Rentokil pest-control and
environmental services group, said: 'The Treasury's economic forecasts have
been misguided, and so have many of its decisions.' Mr Christopher Haskins,
chairman of food manufacturer Northern Foods, argues that many of the
Treasury's failures in judging the economy stem from a 'disastrous' lack of
understanding about the needs of industry.
Although the Treasury appears to recognise the problems, it is moving only
slowly to a new policy of forming better links with industry, commerce and
the academic world. One difficulty is that, under civil service convention,
Treasury officials' advice to ministers is normally considered secret,
letting ministers consider privately a range of possibilities, before a
final policy decision.
According to Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, the shift so
far does not add up to much. 'We still have the Treasury having its own
debate about economic policy and another, unconnected debate going on
outside.'
Any changes in the Treasury's way of working which result from the new
initiatives will relate to two important areas: people and organisation.
Most of the top officials are Oxbridge-trained and have spent all their
careers either in government or other public-service jobs. Exceptions are
Sir Terry and Mr Budd, who both worked together as economists at the London
Business School in the 1970s.
Sir Terry came to the department in 1980, initially as chief economic
adviser. He stepped up to the top job nearly two years ago. Since then he
has lost much of his early reputation as an outsider wanting to shake up
Whitehall. Mr Budd, who joined the Treasury in September 1991 from Barclays
Bank, where he was economic adviser, has emerged as a force for change
within the organisation.
A frequent criticism by business leaders and politicians is that Treasury
employees, however bright, have too narrow an understanding of the world
outside government. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench
finance committee, who runs a family wine business, said: 'I'd like to see
more people at the Treasury with a gut feeling about how industry works.'
Although self-confidence has been a feature at the Treasury for decades  - a
result of its role at the centre of power - Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury
permanent secretary from 1974 to 1983, reckons that the current long spell
of Conservative government may be a factor behind the Treasury's
difficulties. He said that the Treasury had not employed enough 'mavericks'
who would question ministers' own judgments about the economy.
Mr Richard Tolkien, a former Treasury official who is now head of corporate
finance at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, said: 'Inside the Treasury in
the early 1980s, if you did not go along with ministers' views, you
prospered less than those who did.'
One way forward has been proposed by Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool
University, another member of the forecasting panel, who would like to see
officials attaching their names to specific initiatives. That, he believes,
would eventually encourage the promotion of officials with good ideas.
A separate criticism is that the Treasury is simply too powerful. Mr Graham
Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, a research group, said the
Treasury had an important job in restraining growth in public spending. But
the effort it puts into this deflects from other equally important tasks,
such as establishing the right relationship between central and local
government, and attracting more private capital into roads and railways. Mr
Paul Lester, chief executive of the Graseby electronics group (formerly
Cambridge Electronic Industries), said: 'The Treasury spends too much time
asking how it can cut spending, rather than asking how to spend money on
useful projects.'
Following on from suggestions that the Treasury is doing too many jobs, many
 -including the CBI's Mr Davies and Mr Andrew Britton, director of the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a private sector
think-tank - have called for it to be split up. Mr Britton said: 'The
Treasury is trying to be both an Office of Management and Budget, and a
Council of Economic Advisers (the two US institutions supervising public
spending and overall economic policy). It ends up being neither.'
Such ideas are not on the agenda at present. And no one pretends that a
'devolved' Treasury - with its functions scattered around other government
departments, possibly with monetary policy being handed over to a newly
independent Bank of England - would by itself guarantee better times for the
UK economy. But if the Treasury's new initiative fails to deliver more
successful policies, pressure for more radical changes will mount.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Reviewing the regulators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME is ripe for reviewing the British system for regulating privatised
utilities. This is partly because it is over eight years since Oftel, the
first of the new watchdogs, was set up to regulate a privatised British
Telecommunications. Since then, the gas, electricity and water industries
have been privatised and there has been a lively debate on whether the
regulators have been too weak to stop these companies earning excess profits
or have expropriated shareholders' wealth through over-zealous action.
Time has also revealed some of the structural defects of privatised
industries. Such defects are behind both the current Monopolies and Mergers
Commission's investigation of British Gas and the government's energy
review.
The regulatory system is working reasonably well. It is certainly much
better than the old approach which encouraged constant ministerial
interference in nationalised companies. But there is room for improvement.
Given the overall economic importance of the utilities, the prize of a
better system is well worth aiming at. But, unless the government initiates
a review soon, the future shape of regulation may be set by precedents
established on a piecemeal basis at the MMC, without any attempt to learn
wider lessons.
The experience so far is summarised in a report published this week by the
European Policy Forum, a UK think-tank. Although the report contains much
interesting detail, its overall tone - that investors are being treated
unfairly as a result of arbitrary actions by over-mighty regulators - is
questionable.
The pitched battles between utilities and their regulators are largely a
result of the government's decision to privatise industries as
quasi-monopolies. Lacking the discipline of effective competition, it is not
surprising that some of these companies have used their muscle to the
detriment of customers and fledgling rivals. The regulators would not be
doing their jobs if such abuses of monopoly power went unchallenged.
A review of utility regulation would need to examine at least the following
issues: the accountability and discretion of the regulators; whether the
current system needs streamlining; and how structural changes to utilities
should be brought about.
The clearest issue is accountability. Too often the process by which
regulators reach their decisions is opaque and they themselves
insufficiently accountable. Possible solutions could involve requiring
regulators to hold public hearings and/or to give detailed reasons for their
decisions. Parliament would also have a greater incentive to oversee their
actions if a select committee had the right to veto top appointments.
But the need for greater accountability does not necessarily mean that the
regulators' discretion should be curtailed, as some suggest. A case can be
made for a more legalistic framework on US lines. But the US system has
proved costly and too open to regulatory capture.
A case can also be made for streamlining the current patchwork, in which
each regulator has somewhat different powers, and even for merging the
various bodies into one or more 'super-regulators'. But, while greater
harmonisation has its attractions, so does the present diversity.
Even more important is how structural changes to the utilities, such as
breaking them up into smaller competing units, should be engineered. This is
not now the exclusive province of the regulators and nor should it be.
Regulators can refer companies to the MMC, which then makes recommendations.
Although this system of checks and balances has merit, it is a rough and
ready approach not clearly understood by investors.
Given the complexity of the issues, what is needed is not hasty reform, but
a thorough review. Since many of the current problems stem from
privatisation decisions taken by ministers and their civil servants behind
closed doors, such a review should be both open and independent.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Housing choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT wishes to encourage the revival of the private rented sector
of the UK housing market to improve choice. It also wants to reduce tax
subsidies for homeowners, to reduce public expenditure.
Progress towards both aims could be achieved by sweeping away mortgage
interest tax relief at the next Budget. Not only would this save over Pounds
5bn of public spending next year, it would help restore the fiscal balance
between different types of housing tenure. Modest investment incentives for
landlords might also be considered to stimulate the private rented sector.
However, instant abolition of mortgage interest tax relief is inadvisable
economically and infeasible politically. The loss of this subsidy would
almost certainly depress house prices further and thus impede the hoped-for
recovery. Politically, the most obvious problem is that the Conservatives'
election manifesto promised to maintain mortgage interest tax relief. The
government is unlikely to overturn such an unambiguous pledge, especially
since the extension of home ownership in the 1980s is seen as one of its
greatest achievements. However, the absence of any qualification insisting
that mortgage interest tax relief be retained in its present form offers
some scope for manoeuvre.
First, the tax relief could be capped at its present level. It has already
been restricted to the first Pounds 30,000 of loans for over a decade. Since
1991, it has also been limited to the basic rate of tax of 25 per cent.
Meanwhile falling interest rates have reduced its value to around Pounds 600
a year per mortgage. Capping would prevent the bill rising if interest rates
rise in the future.
Second, the rate of tax relief could be trimmed from 25 per cent to 20 per
cent, the new lower rate of tax introduced in the last Budget. This would
cost homeowners not much more than Pounds 10 a month, an amount unlikely to
depress house prices further. The level of tax relief could be further cut
once the housing market recovers.
Neither step would do much to help improve the government's fiscal position,
saving perhaps Pounds 1bn at most. But by capping the cost and beginning to
ratchet it down, progress would at last begin towards abolishing a subsidy
which has distorted the housing market for too long.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Personal View: The missing link in Britain's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial strategy is the vital missing component of the UK's market
economy. It is not possible for market forces to allocate resources
efficiently unless the markets know and understand what they are doing.
Macroeconomic and financial policy alone are not enough. Industrial strategy
means developing a common understanding about the role of industry in the
economy and the direction of technological and industrial progress.
Despite Britain's success in improving productivity during the 1980s, there
is an urgent need to rebuild confidence in UK industry. The nation has a
chronic trade deficit, a persistent recession and rising unemployment. There
is not enough productive capacity in UK manufacturing and too much capacity
in financial services.
The country has expectations for living standards which the economy will be
unable to deliver in the immediate future. It will be unable to deliver them
at all unless industry is rebuilt.
The UK is reaping the results of 20 years of myopic complacency. Too many
political and business leaders were misled into believing that manufacturing
industry had become unimportant. In truth, prosperity depends more than ever
on technology and industry.
Service industries are rarely able to improve their productivity or service
quality by their own efforts alone. They usually need new and improved - or
more affordable - equipment.
Many people seem to think that 'technology' means machines and equipment.
But machines and equipment - and the software for their operation - are only
the products of technology. Technology is the practical capability to
produce goods or services. It is therefore about people, their skills and
knowledge and the ways they are organised. 'High technology' businesses are
the ones which require high levels of specialised skill, knowledge and
organisation.
It takes time for industry to accumulate expertise, to build cohesive teams
and to establish a strong market position. Therefore, to achieve industrial
competitiveness normally requires decades of persistent activity, not just a
few years. Strategic vision and consistency of policy by companies, by their
financial investors and by government are crucial.
This cannot be achieved by macroeconomic policy alone. Hence the need for a
coherent and sustained industrial strategy. Achieving it, though, will
require a new approach by industry, government, education and the financial
world. That is why the Engineering Employers' Federation published its
industrial strategy proposals in late November.
The federation argues that industry must develop its own strategic thinking
and look for organic growth, not just acquisitions. Government must
stimulate and co-ordinate strategic thinking and take the lead in developing
a 'vision' of how technology can be developed to national advantage. Neither
the ideas nor the action to develop them need originate with government, but
it has an essential role as catalyst and stimulant.
The government's active role must include shifting the policy emphasis from
scientific research to technological development; and maintaining support
for technology through to full commercial development. This involves not
only government-funded R&amp;D but also many other governmental activity,
including public purchasing; the regulation of telecommunications, energy
and transport industries; provision of infrastructure; and provision of
education and training.
These needs are not met by existing government policy and departmental
structure. There is much to welcome in the detail of recent government
actions, but as yet there is no sign of strategic thinking. There needs to
be a powerful unit with overall responsibility for industrial strategy,
backed by the willing and active co-operation of all government departments.
Otherwise, the present over-emphasis of the short term and fragmentation of
policy will continue.
The federation hopes that the Department of Trade and Industry's
competitiveness unit is now 'benchmarking' the UK's performance, including
that of government, against its successful competitors. Merely gathering
information on what other countries do is not in itself a strategy.
This, and much other information, must be used for industry and government
jointly to develop strategic thinking in the context of the country's own
situation and its own creative energies. Only then would it have the
essential background of knowledge and understanding for market forces to
function effectively.

Feelers are being put out to find an occupant for one of the City's more
accident-prone jobs - the chairmanship of financial services group Guinness
Mahon Holdings. Ex-Schroders man Geoffrey Bell has been doing the job since
November 1987 and is keen to return to his New York firm.
The affable Bell is the latest in a long line of chairmen - ranging from the
prickly Sir Alastair Morton and the politically astute Edmund Dell to the
interfering Lord Kissin - who have found that the job is trickier than it
looks. The group is now Japanese-owned, has been recapitalised yet again,
and a reinvigorated management team is trying once more to prove that it has
a worthwhile role.
One intriguing suggestion is that British Nuclear Fuels' chairman, John
Guinness, the former civil servant masterminding electricity privatisation,
might be offerred the job. He is, after all, a descendant of the founding
family.
Another possibility would be Anthony Loehnis, 56, the former Bank of England
director responsible for international matters. After a surprisingly short
stint as a vice-chairman of merchant bankers SG Warburg, Loehnis has
decamped to Jacob Rothschild's empire, where he has been given a
directorship at J Rothschild International Assurance.
Of the two, Loehnis would seem the more obvious choice. An ex-diplomat and
former personal assistant to Gordon Richardson during his Schroder days,
Loehnis helped smooth the entry of Japanese firms into the gilt-edged market
during his time at the Bank. But chairing a subsidiary of the Bank of
Yokohama is not quite the same as being the London figurehead of the Bank of
Tokyo.

The organisers of the UN-sponsored Somalia peace talks that ended in Addis
Ababa yesterday did their best to put the bitterly divided delegates at
their ease. Warlords attending the UN cocktail party in a grand ballroom at
the Hilton Hotel rubbed shoulders with the secretary-
general, dipped into huge trays of smoked salmon and hors d'oeuvres, and
made polite noises about a huge ice sculpture in the centre of the room
depicting not a swan, but the letters 'UN'.
But most appreciated was a homely touch when business got under way. Qat,
the leaf which when chewed releases a mild amphetamine, is to Somalia what
tea is to Britain or coffee is to Europe. Every day large quantities were
purchased in Ethiopia, wrapped up in large banana fronds, and delivered into
the conference room by waiters in white tails.

What does one make of Burton's latest management gimmick? Only a week after
the retailer announced that it was cutting 2,000 full-time jobs and creating
3,000 part-time ones, Burton has issued 250 of its retail store managers
with About Time, a new book on part-time working by Patricia Hewitt, deputy
big cheese of the Institute for Public Policy Research, Lord Hollick's
socialist think-tank.
Burton stresses that the Pounds 9.95 tomes are not intended as farewell
presents but are meant to educate. No doubt Hewitt will be chastened by the
fact that the biggest interest in her book so far has come from a pillar of
the capitalist establishment seeking an alibi for getting rid of people.

30th anniversary of the death of Hugh Gaitskell, the former Labour leader
who tried in vain to heal the party's internal divisions over disarmament
and nationalisation.
So far all we know is that Tony Clarke, chairman of Labour's National
Executive Committee and former postal workers' union boss, will be there,
but Glenda Jackson, the actress and newly elected Labour MP for Hampstead,
will not. She has a prior engagement.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Observer: Wall Street kite-flying
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Well, well. According to the Wall Street rumour mill, Salomon Bros may
rehire John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman and legendary bond-trader,
sacked in 1991 as part of the management shake-up in the wake of the US
Treasury auction 'irregularities'.
Neither Salomon nor Meriwether is commenting, but it is believed the firm's
hugely successful group of bond-traders and arbitrageurs, who generated
several billion dollars in revenue for Salomon last year, are lobbying for
his return. Their case is easy to understand. Salomon is first and foremost
a bond-trader and if someone of Meriwether's talents, and popularity, were
to pop up on the other side of Wall Street, it could be bad for business.
Although Meriwether was fined and suspended from the securities business for
three months by the SEC for failing to supervise properly the trader who
submitted false bids in the 1991 treasury bond auctions, it is argued that
he had little to do with the events that led to the scandal. His only fault
was his naivety, say his fans.
There is one formidable obstacle to his return, however, in the shape of
Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who cleaned up Salomon in the
immediate aftermath of the scandal. Perhaps he's going soft. But it's hard
to believe that he would want to see such a highly visible symbol of
Salomon's much-criticised past rejoining the firm.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Cold war warmed over: Militant Islam has become the west's
new evil empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago this week the Algerian army deposed President Chadli Bendjedid
and cancelled the second ballot of parliamentary elections, due to take
place a few days later.
It was, on the face of it, an outrageous thing to do, just after the
decisive political victory of liberal democracy over Soviet communism in
eastern Europe and the decisive military victory of the western democracies
over the army of an Arab dictator in the Gulf war. Surely the same western
democracies that had put great pressure on governments elsewhere in Africa
to accept multi-party elections would not tolerate such a blatant abortion
of the electoral process on the very fringe of western Europe?
They did, of course, and the reason is no secret. The Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) was virtually certain to win an overall majority if the second
ballot had gone ahead. During the cold war, the west would turn a blind eye
to authoritarian practices if the alternative seemed likely to be a
communist or pro-communist government. Now, it seems, the same rule applies,
only for 'communist' read 'Islamic fundamentalist'.
In the case of communism, there was a double rationale for this attitude. On
the one hand, the expansion of communism, by whatever means, was seen as
threatening western security. On the other, it was argued that a communist
victory, even through the ballot box, would in fact be a defeat for
democracy, since a communist government would not allow any more free
elections.
This second argument has been used explicitly in the Algerian case by a
senior US official, Mr Edward Djerejian, who said there would be no
overwhelming merit in a system of 'one person, one vote, one time'.
It has some plausibility, in that some of the FIS leaders had said openly
that they did not believe in multi-party democracy, and it was doubtful
whether the discredited Mr Chadli would have been strong enough to hold them
to the constitution once they were in office.
A year later, however, the claim by the army to have saved democracy from
itself is looking thin. Thousands of Islamic militants are in prison (and
Amnesty International has again begun to receive regular reports of
torture), but there are enough still at large to carry on nightly gun
battles with the security forces in many parts of the country. There is no
sign of new elections being held. Even in economic policy the regime has
reverted to 1970s-style dirigisme.
The west's willingness to support such a regime suggests that Islamic
fundamentalism has also replaced communism in the other half of the cold war
rationale. It is seen as a threat not only to Algerian liberties but also to
western security. John Esposito, a leading US specialist on Islam, shows in
a new book, The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? (Oxford, Dollars 22), that
this view is indeed held by many influential people in the US.
It is probably even more widely held in Europe. The normally sober Economist
magazine, in its imaginative history of the 21st century published last
month, sees a new Arab-Islamic superpower, with Iran and Pakistan as
satellites, conquering Turkey and south-east Europe, and going on in
alliance with China to subdue large parts of Russia.
The Economist imagined this superpower starting with a coup in Saudi Arabia
in 2011. But it also assumes that an isolationist US will confine its
interest to a 'tranquil, fairly prosperous and almost wholly democratic'
western hemisphere, while western Europe, protected by its nuclear
deterrent, suffers only an influx of Russian refugees.
Tragic as such a scenario might be for Turkey and eastern Europe, a cynical
west European (and still more a cynical American) may be tempted to wonder
what all the fuss is about, if that is the worst that 'resurgent Islam' can
do to him. The most plausible part of it is that western Europe's 'disaster'
takes the form of a bungled Anglo- French military intervention in the
Middle East, not an Arab or Moslem invasion of western Europe itself.
Mr Esposito takes an optimistic view of Islamic revivalism, concluding that
'guided by our stated ideals and goals of freedom and self-determination,
the west has an ideal vantage point for appreciating the aspirations of many
in the Moslem world as they seek to define new paths for their future'.
The French scholar Olivier Roy is much gloomier about what Islamic movements
have to offer their own people. But the title of his book, The Failure of
Political Islam (L'echec de l'Islam politique) (Seuil/Esprit, FFr130), is
also implicitly reassuring from a selfish western point of view.
Mr Roy, who was an admirer of Islamic politics in its revolutionary phase,
recounts sadly how such movements have retreated during the 1980s into what
he calls 'neo-fundamentalism', or even 'lumpen-Islamism', led by less
well-educated people who interpret Islam as an austere and joyless
life-style rather than a recipe for social liberation.
Mr Roy takes it for granted that the FIS will come to power in Algeria
sooner or later. But, he says, it would change only the law and les moeurs -
not so much actual morals as the code of public, or publicly admissible,
behaviour. 'It no longer offers any model of a different society or a better
tomorrow.'
Algeria under such a government would be more like Saudi Arabia than Iran.
Not perhaps the ideal neighbour one would wish for, but hardly a significant
threat to European security.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Tough middle age for lifetime jobs: Charles Leadbeater
examines the pressures facing Japanese employment during recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was going to call 1992 our annus horribilis,' remarked one of the Bank of
Japan's senior officials, 'but I think we had better reserve that term for
1993.'
It is certainly how this year will be remembered by 35 hapless older
managers at Pioneer, the manufacturer of compact discs and video recorders.
They have been offered an ignominious choice: accept early retirement or
face the sack.
Until this year, they would have counted themselves among the beneficiaries
of the Japanese system of lifetime employment at large companies, which
guarantees male, full-time workers continuous work until retirement at 60.
The system is an exchange of loyalty for trust. After years of dedicated
grind in the company cause, workers trust their employers to take care of
them until retirement, even if they do barely productive jobs in their
twilight years.
Pioneer's move has shocked its own staff and many other companies, because
it casts doubt on whether that bargain still holds good. Moreover, it is not
alone in taking a tougher line with older managers.
Nippon Carbon, the ceramics group, recently introduced a system under which
section chiefs and general managers lose their titles once they reach the
age of 57. With the title goes about a third of their pay packet.
Yamaichi, the securities company, has dispatched 200 senior managers to
relatively unglamorous jobs in its retail securities business. Mitsukoshi,
the department store, is slimming its managerial workforce to give younger
managers more influence. Other companies, particularly in the steel and
electronics industries, are taking similar actions.
Taken together, these moves have prompted concern that the severity of
Japan's economic downturn may put its lifetime employment system under
threat. But how great is that threat?
Employers are under mounting pressure to reduce wage bills. Most Japanese
companies are facing their third successive year of falling profits, despite
cutting costs such as advertising and investment. Labour costs, which make
up about 43 per cent of fixed costs for the average company, are an obvious
target, particularly as many employers say they are overstaffed.
According to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business attitudes,
conducted in November and published last month, there was a gap of 8
percentage points between the number of companies reporting an excess of
labour over those reporting a shortage.
Two years ago there was a gap, in favour of labour shortages, of 46
percentage points.
The financial pressures upon Japanese companies have fuelled speculation
that they may be on the verge of adopting more western methods of
management, by aggressively cutting labour costs to raise profitability.
As yet it is little more than speculation. For the most striking
characteristic of the Japanese labour market during this downturn has been
its resilience. In the recession of the mid-1980s, caused by the yen's
appreciation, the unemployment rate rose to 3 per cent. Nine months into
this downturn, unemployment has stayed constant at just over 2 per cent.
The ratio of job offers to job seekers has fallen to 0.96, which means that
for every 100 job seekers there are only 96 job offers. However, this is
still well above the ratio's low of 0.6 in the mid-1980s.
In the current downturn, 75 industries have applied for government subsidies
to help them pay the wages of laid-off workers. In the recession of the
mid-1980s, about 161 industries applied for such subsidies.
Employers are strongly resisting reductions in their staff. Japan's low
birth rate means the workforce is likely to grow by less than 1 per cent for
the rest of the decade. Employers fear that, if they lay off workers now,
they will face a labour shortage once the economy recovers.
In an attempt to retain workers, many Japanese companies are going to
extreme lengths. Nikko Securities estimates that between July and September
last year 900,000 manufacturing workers, about 6 per cent of the workforce,
became 'unemployed within their company'. Most are being paid to stay at
home, others are doing jobs of little value within their offices or
factories.
Many older workers are being shuffled off to subsidiaries and suppliers. A
European banker recalls how the president of a leading Japanese bank
described its plans to cut employment costs without sacking anyone: 'The
president explained that the bank was fortunate because it had plenty of
clients who were facing a labour shortage who were only too happy to take
extra staff. What that probably means is that each of the clients was told
to take some of the bank's 55-year-old managers or they would not have their
overdraft extended.'
It is only when companies have exhausted all the alternatives - reduced
overtime, cut part-time workers, frozen recruitment, transferred staff to
subsidiaries, paid them for months to stay home - that they consider more
radical action.
Even then, moves such as Pioneer's do not mark the start of Japan's
conversion to western approaches to cost cutting. The company's 35 managers
represent less than 0.5 per cent of the company's workforce, and the scale
of the cuts pales in comparison with the redundancies announced by some US
and European companies. In December, for example, IBM, the US computer
group, announced it would cut its workforce by 25,000 or 8 per cent of the
total. General Motors, the US car manufacturer, and Daimler Benz, the German
engineering group, have also announced big cuts.
In addition, most Japanese companies regard Pioneer's move as an aberration.
Nippon Steel's response was typical: 'Our policy is to protect employment.
We do not fire anyone, we transfer them to new business areas.'
Mr Jason James, equity analyst at James Capel, explained: 'It is very bad
for a company's image to fire people, because for Japanese companies
sackings are still taken as a sign that the company is in trouble.'
Yet the downturn is unlikely to leave the lifetime employment system
unscathed. It will undergo reform rather than revolution. The system itself
is not under threat, but companies are demanding more in return for the
security they provide, particularly for older, white-collar workers. In past
recessions, blue-collar workers bore the main burden of adjustment. Now,
early retirement programmes for managers, which were rare a decade ago, are
becoming commonplace.
Clarion, which makes loudspeakers for audio systems, plans to eliminate 300
jobs by March primarily by encouraging early retirement among production
managers in their 40s and 50s.
Sanyo Electric last month adopted what could well become a model for other
companies in the hard-pressed electronics sector. Between the ages of 50 and
54, employees now have three options: remain a Sanyo employee and accept
they may be compulsorily redeployed; leave Sanyo to join an affiliate at a
lower salary but with a higher retirement allowance; or accept training and
finance from the company to help set up their own businesses.
Such schemes have two main aims. They reduce the ranks of highly paid middle
managers within large companies, and provide opportunities for younger
managers. They also send a powerful signal to younger workers: security of
employment after 50 will increasingly depend on their performance and cannot
be taken for granted.
The foundations of the lifetime employment system may yet be shaken by a
sharp decline into outright recession. Such a decline, brought on by a
renewed collapse of the fragile Tokyo stock market, cannot be ruled out.
Electronics companies, which face a prolonged slump in demand, would be
particularly vulnerable.
However, most companies are expecting that last year's emergency Y10,700bn
(Pounds 55bn) public spending package will help revive industry. The
government forecasts that the economy will recover in the third quarter of
this year and achieve 3.3 per cent growth in the year to March 1994. As a
result, most companies should probably be able to avoid deep cuts in their
workforces.
That would allow the lifetime employment system to survive, albeit in
amended form. But for some poorly-performing managers, the victims of that
amendment, the promise of lifelong security may prove increasingly illusory.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: Retention of status quo at BBC the only sensible
option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ROBERTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Sawers argues (Personal View, January 6) that the proliferation
of TV and radio channels will make it increasingly hard to justify a licence
fee to pay for the BBC. Events since New Year suggest quite the opposite is
the case.
Though we were warned by the FT's unfailingly perceptive television critic
in advance of the new ITV regime that more would mean worse, I wonder if any
of us really appreciated how worse. The awfulness of GMTV, for example,
seems to have surprised even those who listened to the clear warnings of its
director of programmes, Lis Howell, not to expect anything 'innovative'.
The decision to award franchises on the basis of money rather than quality
means that - except for those companies which gambled successfully on having
no credible opponents - the new franchise-holders must make big returns
quickly.
Hence cheap programmes will be preferred to expensive ones: no mission to
explain when you can build a tower of toast for the price of a sliced loaf.
And in the race to maximise audience share, the Hollywood cliche that no one
ever went broke underestimating public taste still holds good.
Since there is only so much advertising revenue to go round, the result of
having even more channels will inevitably be that standards fall even
further.
Against this background, there is an overwhelming argument for retaining the
BBC at roughly its present size and with its present range of output. This
means it must have access to adequate, secure and predictable funds. None of
these objectives could be secured by sponsorship, subscription or any of the
other models proposed by David Sawers.
There is of course an element of rough justice in charging everyone the
same, but the sum involved is unbelievably small in relation to the extent
and quality of the BBC's output; and the costs of varying the charge
according to income or use of BBC services would surely not justify the
possible benefits.
As Chris Dunkley passionately and correctly argued when the government
issued a discussion paper on BBC finances, ministers must constantly be
reminded that the status quo is an option. I suggest it is the only sensible
one.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: Myth of inefficient use of accountancy information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAMANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his accountancy column (January 7), Andrew Jack refers to the
responsibility of financial journalists when commenting on financial reports
and accounting issues. One way in which this responsibility could be
correctly exercised is in recognising that the stock exchange is in fact
rather good at discounting accounting information correctly and is not
misled by simplistic devices.
Nevertheless, Mr Jack refers to the way in which company share prices 'seem'
to drop after purely presentational accounting changes: and it may be true
that this is the appearance. But in fact it is difficult to make money out
of the marketmakers, assuming the announcement of the results was not in
itself confusing. The article also refers to the attention paid by analysts
and investors to short-term returns and bottom-line earnings, where all the
evidence - overwhelmingly - is that the market takes the long view and takes
account of a wider information set. But it is true that the short-term
picture is often the best new evidence about the long-term picture.
The constant repetition of these myths about the inefficiency with which
accounting information is used is exceptionally dangerous and this is not a
secondary question. There are two serious consequences. The first is that
the setting of accounting standards and their implementation is affected by
a misapprehension of how the information is discounted in share prices - a
point which is relevant to your Lex column of January 7. Second, and more
seriously, if a company management believes these myths, the directors may
take action in the real economy which will be detrimental to the national
interest. Thus, for example, management may make short-term investment
decisions because they believe that that is what the market is looking for,
whereas in fact they could take long-term investment decisions for which, if
those decisions were correctly made and accounted for, the market would give
the company full credit.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps the most interesting statement in the Virgin/BA affair is that
of Sir Colin Marshall that Richard Branson's allegations were 'wholly
without foundation and unjustified' ('Virgin's honour remains intact',
January 12).
There seem to me to be three possibilities: Sir Colin may have deliberately
lied; he may have investigated the allegations and found no evidence; or he
may have not bothered to investigate them.
I think that the shareholders in BA are entitled to know whether their chief
executive is venal, incompetent or merely arrogant.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: International trends point to an uncommercial future
for Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD LE COYTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, British Nuclear Fuels' denial of the economic and political reality
surrounding the future of its Thorp plant (Letters, January 6) does not mean
the facts will disappear.
BNFL's two largest foreign customers, Germany and Japan, are reconsidering
the wisdom of reprocessing nuclear waste. The chairmen of the German
electrical utilities are engaged in discussions with politicians to reach a
consensus on energy policy.
These discussions include ceasing reprocessing in favour of the cheaper
option of direct storage. BNFL's contracts include clauses enabling its
customers to withdraw from reprocessing.
The Japanese government has been rocked by international protest surrounding
the recent plutonium shipment from France - a taste of things to come if
Thorp begins operation.
Technical problems with the Monju fast breeder reactor and widespread fear
of regional political instability caused by Japan's plutonium surplus, has
prompted a reappraisal of its commitment to the plutonium path.
For these and other reasons, not limited to Germany and Japan, the
likelihood of BNFL obtaining contracts beyond the first decade of Thorp's
operations is remote. Further, it is doubtful whether existing contracts for
the first decade will run according to BNFL's plan.
The UK government's refusal to underwrite BNFL's contracts with Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear is a sign that BNFL's optimism is unwarranted.
Thorp's profit seems destined to change from meagre to negative.
The question facing the UK government is whether to operate Thorp and create
a costly decommissioning problem (even using BNFL's minimal estimate of
Pounds 900m) or to recognise that times have changed since 1977 when the
go-ahead for Thorp was given. The only rational conclusion is to scrap
Thorp.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak warns of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Dalepak, the frozen foods and ready meals group, dropped 66p to
317p yesterday when it warned that difficult trading conditions and higher
raw material prices would cut full-year profits.
Interim results, for the period to October 31, showed a fall from Pounds
1.7m to Pounds 1.6m at the pre-tax level, although sales rose 0.9 per cent
to Pounds 21.4m and trading profits were unchanged at Pounds 1.7m.
Heavy capital expenditure, which will reach Pounds 3.6m in the year,
increased interest charges from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 125,000.
Mr Michael Abrahams, chairman, said the full year would show 'a modest
decline at the trading level' against last year's Pounds 4m. Analysts
expected that higher interest charges would mean a larger decline in pre-tax
profits, which were Pounds 3.9m in the previous year. Gearing would be about
40 per cent by the year end.
However, Mr Chris Ivory, chief executive, said that the year was hard to
predict because the group's fourth quarter was usually the strongest trading
period and this year the benefits of new capacity would begin to be seen as
well.
He said sterling's fall had increased prices of imported meat by between 5
and 10 per cent, although vegetable prices had been more stable because of a
glut of produce. About 70 per cent of Dalepak's raw materials are imported.
Price increases were beginning to be made now.
Consumers traded down from Dalepak's frozen meat grillsteaks, while
supermarkets pushed their own label products aggressively. Although Dalepak
makes these too, margins are tight. Next month Dalepak is re-emphasising its
brand with a new logo and packaging.
Earnings per share fell 8.2 per cent, from 10.13p to 9.3p, and the interim
dividend is unchanged at 1.5p.
COMMENT
The share price fall may look alarming, but probably reflects earlier
over-optimism rather than deep concern now. Since Mr Ivory joined in 1988
profits have risen strongly, but recession and the power of the supermarkets
have caught up with Dalepak. Next year should see the benefits from the
factory expansion - sales of frozen vegetable grills were held back by lack
of capacity in the first half but a new line was installed over Christmas -
and a lower level of spending, so profit growth should resume. This year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m would give a p/e of about 15.5 times, still a
little high.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Recovery at Howden continues with 4% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern that was brought low by
a Danish tunnelling contract, continued its recovery in the first half of
the year.
Pre-tax profit rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 6.05m (Pounds 5.81m) in the six
months to October 31 after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.46m, the final
loss on the infamous Great Belt contract for four tunnelling machines.
Last month's settlement of the long-running dispute with the client, MT
Group, helped the shares rise from 34p in mid-October to 67p ahead of the
results. They eased 4p yesterday on profit-taking.
Operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 9.9m on sales of Pounds 156.2m
(Pounds 138.3m). Earnings per share, affected by a Pounds 30.6m rights issue
in 1991, slipped back to 1.8p (2.2p).
Mr Ronald Watson, finance director, said the growth came from a healthy
opening order book of more than Pounds 300m and from overseas business,
which accounted for roughly 60 per cent of sales. The largest division, air
and gas, had shown a strong profit increase.
Construction and mining, however, had been held back by delays on big
contracts such as the Jubilee underground line in London and a project for
British Coal.
These two contracts, plus delays on a power station for Iran, lay behind a
reduction in the order book to less than Pounds 300m by the half-way stage.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 3.31m to Pounds 1.39m.
Debt rose from Pounds 24.9m to Pounds 40m after Pounds 6m of spending on
acquisitions and the translation impact of sterling's devaluation.
Mr Watson said payments from MT and working capital improvements had brought
debt down to Pounds 32m by December 31 and it should fall below Pounds 30m -
giving gearing of less than 30 per cent - by the year-end.
The interim dividend goes up to 0.75p (0.7p).
COMMENT
After the Great Belt horror story - it trebled debt to Pounds 76m and nearly
wiped out profits in 1990-91 - it is a relief for Howden to return to the
normal level of uncertainty that surrounds contracting companies. The order
book could do with confirmation of some of the big delayed contracts,
although overheads have been cut in the meantime. There is also some
uncertainty overseas because of the downturn in Germany. With the second
half traditionally stronger, Howden is forecast to hold pre-tax profit at
about Pounds 18m for the full year, giving a prospective p/e of nearly 12.
The absence of the Pounds 2.5m exceptional charge lays the basis for resumed
earnings growth of perhaps 15 per cent next year, although the late-cycle
nature of the business keeps the outlook tough. Contracting uncertainty and
MT memories lie behind its discount to the market. After a good run, the
price looks about right.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING reversion to its core activities, Jacques Vert, the women's
fashion wear group, returned to the black and the dividend list in the six
months to October 24, though Mr Jack Cynamon and Mr Alan Green, joint
chairmen, said that 'a level of concern must be expressed as to prospects in
the immediate future'.
Mr Malcolm Heald, finance director since April, said the group had had a
good August and first half of September, but that there had been 'a 30 per
cent dive in sales between Black Wednesday and Christmas'. The first week of
the current sale had been good, he said, but the second had fallen off.
Pre-tax profits in the half were Pounds 186,000 (losses Pounds 125,000).
Turnover slipped by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 19m, though the cost of sales
fell more steeply to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 11.9m), giving gross profits up at
Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 7.78m).
Gearing was cut from 79 to 49.7 per cent through the reduction of stocks and
improved debtor collection. Net bank overdrafts at October 25 were down at
Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 6.11m on April 25), resulting in interest payable
falling to Pounds 304,000 (Pounds 402,000).
Below the line a tax credit of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 48,000) eased the
board's decision to pay an interim dividend of 1p, according to Mr Heald.
Last time the interim was 2p, though the final was passed. Earnings were
4.2p (losses 0.8p) per share.
On the retail side - 10 per cent of the group's business - the number of
concessions rose from five in July to 25 in October, 32 now and, said Mr
Heald, '36 by the end of the week if all goes well'.
JV Plus, the line for larger women, continued to expand, the Grace
collection was launched, while Alain Cannelle was closed, the 51 per cent
stake in L'Anglaise was sold, and Mr Ben de Lisi bought out Vert's share of
their joint venture.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Barbour Index shows 2% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARBOUR INDEX, the specialist information services group, yesterday reported
a 2 per cent decline in half-year turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per
share, but is increasing its interim dividend.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31 slipped to Pounds 2.71m
(Pounds 2.78m) on turnover of Pounds 7m (Pounds 7.17m), reflecting the
depressed state of its primary market, professionals in the construction
industry.
Earnings per share at 10.9p were down from 11.1p, but the interim dividend
is increased to 2.55p (2.4p) 'in view of the company's financial strength
and our confidence in the future,' said Mr Patrick Barbour, chairman.
The balance sheet remained strong with net cash increasing by Pounds 760,000
to Pounds 4.4m compared with a year ago.
Mr Barbour said the group's strategy under depressed economic conditions has
been to increase its investment in the development and launch of new
services, while keeping tight control on costs.
In the past 12 months the company has launched five new services, three for
health and safety and two for construction.
Mr Barbour said this had helped the group replace lost construction
subscribers, where many architects were either out of work or
under-employed.
Health and safety now accounted for about 25 per cent of Barbour's business.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Resort and 3i settle dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels and 3i, the venture capital group, have reached an out of
court settlement of a dispute about whether 3i had an option or an
obligation to subscribe for 800,000 new shares in the leisure company at 50p
each.
Resort's shares have fallen sharply over the last 12 months from a peak of a
little less than 90p to about 30p recently.
The two companies said the dispute 'arose out of a misunderstanding' during
negotiations last year.
Resort has withdrawn its litigation against 3i, and 3i has given an
undertaking to subscribe for the 800,000 shares as soon as Resort's share
price reaches 57p for a period of five consecutive days.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen chief defends shares buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE ROBB, chairman of Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday defended his
purchase of 500,000 of the company's shares following an approach from
Bellwether Exploration, the US oil and gas group, which was only disclosed
this week.
Mr Robb, who became non-executive chairman on January 1, bought the shares
between December 24 and January 4 at between 6 3/8 p and 7 1/8 p. Bellwether
had proposed an all-paper deal which it claimed would value Aberdeen shares
at 10 3/4 p. They closed last night at 8 3/4 p.
The chairman said he had consulted the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, and
lawyers Ashurst Morris Crisp, as well as the company before buying the
shares. However, action on such advice would not be a defence if the
purchase was found to transgress company law.
Mr Robb, who has been a director of the company since it was founded in
1981, said he bought the stock in light of the decline in the small oil and
gas sector Before the transaction he owned 100,000 shares.
He had waited until after a meeting with Bellwether on December 14, when the
board of Aberdeen and its advisers decided the merger proposal was 'a
non-starter' and did not need to be disclosed.
Mr Robb said he had also waited until Aberdeen announced its intentions
towards Brabant Resources, the USM-quoted company, which has been the
unwilling target of Aberdeen's own merger proposals.
When it appeared that Bellwether might make an announcement, Aberdeen drew
the Stock Exchange's attention to the already disclosed purchase.
Nevertheless, the Stock Exchange is likely to interview Mr Robb, the company
and its advisers about the transaction. Mr Robb said he would be happy to
co-operate.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Simon sells waste and water side to Thames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering has sold its water and waste treatment business to Thames
Water, the privatised utility.
Thames will pay Pounds 14.2m cash and assume Pounds 6m of debt.
Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive of Simon, said the sale price was in line
with expectations six months ago, when the group announced it would be
withdrawing from most of its environmental businesses.
Mr Kemp said he expected to be able to announce the sale of the
environmental consultancy division consultancy within the next few weeks.
Proceeds of the disposal announced yesterday will reduce gearing which stood
at 50 per cent at the last half year.
The sale ends a period during which Simon acquired the heady rating of an
environmental stock but subsequently fell from grace as results failed to
live up to expectations.
From a high of over 400p in 1990, the shares fell to 70p late last year.
They closed yesterday up 11p at 121p.
The Simon businesses will further reduce Thames Water's dependence on income
that is covered by the water regulators.
'It is a modest deal but it is an important element of our development
programme,' said Mr David Luffrum, finance director at Thames.
The business will be added to PWT, a water treatment design and contracting
business bought in 1989. Together they will produce sales of about Pounds
300m.
The Simon businesses made sales estimated in 1992 at Pounds 54m, and is
expected to have shown a small operating loss.
Profit before interest and tax in the previous year was Pounds 1.7m on sales
of Pounds 66.5m. At end-1991, the businesses had net assets of Pounds 9.1m.
Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive of Thames, said the acquisition completed
the plan 'for full capability in water engineering activities'.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Guinness announces Scotch shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the brewing and spirits group, is to cut 700 jobs in its United
Distillers' Scotch whisky production operations as part of a cost-cutting
and modernisation programme.
The group, which employs 5,000 people in Scotland, will close five
distilleries - a move that will also help to restore the balance between the
industry's output and estimated demand during the 1990s - and three bottling
plants.
Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, said: 'The
investment in new technology requires significant reorganisation to achieve
improved productivity, efficiency and profitability,' he said.
Trade union officials described the decision as 'devastating'. Senior shop
stewards, who claim job losses are likely to be more than 800, are to meet
in Glasgow tomorrow.
Mr Bob Thomson, Scottish secretary of the GMB union, said: 'We will be
demanding a meeting with the Guinness board to reverse the decision.'
Guinness will continue to operate two grain distilleries at Cameronbridge
and Port Dundas, and 26 malt distilleries, including Blair Atholl, Cardhu,
Dalwhinnie and Talisker. Efforts will be made to minimise the impact of the
job cuts through voluntary redundancy and early retirement.
Exceptional operating costs of Pounds 125m, covering the redundancies,
closures and reorganisation, will be charged in the 1992 accounts.
Guinness also announced that it plans to accelerate reorganisation at its
Cruzcampo brewing operations in Spain to improve productivity. The programme
is expected to include further job losses.
Though the group has increased its market share, the Spanish beer market,
previously one of the fastest-growing in Europe, fell 5 per cent last year
and a doubling of the excise duty on beer is expected to depress consumption
again this year.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Beginning of a difficult year for LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Guinness restructuring came as a blow to LVMH, the French luxury goods
group chaired by Mr Bernard Arnault, which is one of Guinness' biggest
shareholders with a 24 per cent stake.
Its shares were suspended in Paris yesterday pending the Guinness
announcement, as were other companies linked to Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH 's
chairman, including Christian Dior, the fashion house, and the Bon Marche
retailing group. LVMH warned in October that both net profits and sales
would be static in 1992 - at FFr3.7bn (Dollars 680m) and FFr22bn
respectively - but yesterday cut its profit estimate to FFr3bn, mainly due
to the shortfall in its contribution from Guinness.
LVMH, which owns some of France's most famous brand names such as Moet et
Chandon champagne and Louis Vuitton luggage as well as its stake in
Guinness, is already struggling in the sluggish luxury goods market.
A year ago it seemed poised for a robust recovery from 1991, when it was
badly affected by the Gulf war. Analysts anticipated a sharp increase in net
profits to as much as FFr4.4bn for 1992.
Forecasts fell steadily throughout the year as the problems posed by the US
recession were aggravated by the economic instability of Japan and the
European slowdown. By the final quarter prospects were clouded by the
relative strength of the French franc after the September currency crisis
and by the threat of a Franco-US trade war.
LVMH said yesterday that its own interests showed a slight decline in 1993,
when the downturn in wine and spirits offset growth from perfume and
luggage. However it is confident of an improvement in 1993 due to the US
recovery and more favourable currencies.
Mr Regis Aubert, analyst at Cholet Dupont in Paris, is waiting for more
details on LVMH's fourth-quarter performance before reviewing his estimate
of FFr3.9bn net profits for 1993. He said: 'It will still be a difficult
year, but it's too soon to judge how difficult.'

FT  13 JAN 93 / Dutch bank sells 400 tonnes of gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH central bank surprised the gold market yesterday by revealing it
had sold one quarter of the gold in its reserves - some 400 tonnes,
equivalent to about 20 per cent of all gold mined in the western world last
year.
This intensified fears that the central banks, with 35,500 tonnes of
official gold in their vaults - or 15 years' output from today's mines  -
would become important suppliers of the metal to the market and hold back
price rises.
The market, already plunged into gloom because the gold price in US dollars
started 1993 at the lowest level for seven years, initially reacted with
relief that so much gold had been absorbed without causing more disturbance.
At yesterday's prices the gold sold by the Dutch central bank was worth
Dollars 4.3bn. The gold price closed in London at Dollars 330.05 a troy
ounce, up Dollars 2.70. 'There is a strong, steady demand for gold that
ought to take the price higher, but this supply from a non-traditional
source is limiting the upward potential,' said Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst
at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said the Dutch
central bank had acted 'after several months' deliberation' so 'this was not
a panic sale. It was premeditated. It was strategic, not tactical, yet the
bank sold when the price was near seven-year lows. The gold market will be
asking: which bank will be next?'
The Dutch bank was following the example set by Belgium which sold 127
tonnes of gold from its reserves in March 1990, and 202 tonnes last June.
A Dutch central bank official said the gold was sold last year through the
London market to bring Dutch gold reserves into line with those of other
main gold-holding countries. Permission for the sale was received from the
Finance Ministry at the end of October and the price was an average of Fl
18,000 a kilo. Analysts said this suggested the dollar price was between
Dollars 324 and Dollars 334 an ounce. They believed some of the Dutch gold
was bought by another central bank.
The sale reduced gold from 59 per cent to 40 per cent of the Dutch bank's
total reserves.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Japanese equity purchases reduce after market fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors reduced their net purchases of Japanese securities
last year by 85 per cent to Y841bn (Pounds 4.3bn) against a background of
steep declines for Japan's three main stock markets, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said yesterday.
The fall in purchases on the three largest exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka, and
Nagoya, came in spite of government attempts to steady the markets in
August, when the Nikkei stock average in Tokyo fell to a low for the year of
14,309.41.
The government emergency package in August included a promise to invest more
public funds in stocks.
This is reflected in the relatively steady level of net purchases by
Japanese banks during the year which at Y1,120bn was only slightly lower
than the Y1,273bn of 1991.
That figure includes public funds invested through trust banks, and
disguises the selling by banks attempting to streamline their strategic
holdings in corporate customers.
It is known that banks have sold some cross-holdings, while industrial
companies have sold stakes in banks which were not their main bank.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, in its annual survey of trading on the three
exchanges, said non-financial companies were net sellers of stocks worth
Y905.8bn, compared with sales of Y1,861.9bn in 1991. Both figures are a
turnround from net purchases of stocks, on the TSE first section alone, of
Y776bn in 1990.
Investment trusts, which sold a net Y1,515.6bn of securities in 1991, slowed
their disposals last year to Y4.2bn net.
The net sales of individual investors also slowed, falling from Y2,531bn to
Y117bn last year. The 26.4 per cent fall in the Nikkei average last year
left many individuals with unrealised losses on their stock portfolios,
prompting them to sit on the shares until prices improve.
However, life and non-life insurance companies, whose net purchases totalled
Y234.8bn in 1991, posted net sales of Y64.6bn last year, while securities
houses trading on their own account sold Y561bn in stocks, after net
purchases of Y62.7bn in 1991.
There was increased selling last year when the Tokyo average rose above
18,000 after the announcement of the August emergency package, suggesting
that many investors are looking to offload stocks as soon as willing buyers
reappear.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Cut in whisky intake will restore balance - The implications
of the reorganisation at United Distillers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE Guinness bought Distillers in 1986, it has devoted much of its energy
to reorganising the distribution and marketing of Scotch whisky. With great
success.
Brands such as Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, White Horse and Haig, which
represent 35 per cent of the Scotch whisky market, have been pushed
up-market with redesigned packaging, new-look advertising and hefty price
increases.
Guinness's whisky arm, United Distillers, now handles the distribution of
more than 90 per cent of its products compared with 20 per cent six years
ago.
Profits have more than doubled as a result from Pounds 357m to Pounds 749m.
Now, though, with the industry worrying about a return of the 1970s' whisky
glut, Guinness is switching its management emphasis to rationalising
production.
Yesterday Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, announced
700 job cuts, the closure of five Scottish distilleries, and Pounds 100m of
investment in modernising whisky production facilities in the next three
years.
Overall world production of Scotch grew slightly last year, but demand fell
in the UK and in other important markets such as the US and Japan.
Mr Alan Gray, industry analyst at Charterhouse Tilney, the securities house,
estimates that the industry cut production of malt whisky last year by 15
per cent and reduced grain whisky output by 3 to 5 per cent.
'I believe further cuts are needed this year - probably 10 to 12 per cent in
malt and 7.5 per cent in grain - to restore the balance between supply and
demand in 1994,' he says.
The closure of UD's four malt distilleries - at Pittyvaich, Balmenach,
Rosebank and Bladnoch - will take out about 9 per cent of UD's capacity and
2.5 per cent of industry production.
Closing the grain distillery at Cambus will reduce UD's capacity by 18 per
cent and that of the industry by about 7 per cent.
The group's growth has slowed dramatically in the past 12 months under the
impact of recession, leading several analysts to suggest that progress from
now on would be more pedestrian.
While it remains committed to its marketing strategy, adverse trading
conditions have increased the pressure on the group to cut costs - not least
to free more resources for its expensive marketing programme.
Together with the distillery closures and their conversion into warehouses
or museums, bottling and packaging operations are to be concentrated in
three centres - Glasgow, Kilmarnock and Leven - reducing the group's
bottling lines from 100 to 68.
Operations at Perth will cease next year with the loss of 300 jobs; the
Broxburn and Leith plants will be closed in 1995 with the loss of another
230 jobs.
Efforts will be made to minimise the impact of unemployment through
voluntary redundancy, early retirement and natural employment turnover.
Mr Greener said: 'The investment in new technology requires significant
reorganisation to achieve improved productivity, efficiency and
profitability. These moves will further equip us to take advantages of the
opportunities through the 1990s and beyond.'
While yesterday's announcement focused on the Scotch whisky industry,
Guinness also took steps to accelerate productivity improvements in its Cruz
Campo brewing operations in Spain. The Pounds 533m acquisition of Cruz Campo
in 1990, followed by that of Union Cervecera, has not brought the expected
rapid rewards.
One of Europe's fastest-growing beer markets at the time of the takeover,
Spanish consumption declined 5 per cent last year in spite of tourist
attractions such as the Olympic Games and Expo 92. A recent doubling of the
excise tax on beer, increasing the retail price by about 20 per cent, is
expected to depress demand further.
Cruz Campo, since the integration of Union Cervecera, has increased its
market share from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, but regards further
productivity improvements as urgent.
Though one brewery has been closed, further rationalisation of production
has been restricted by the costs of distributing beer from centralised
plants.
The group plans to accelerate the reduction of people employed at its nine
breweries but seems unlikely to close any of the plants.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Investors drift from health sector to engineering, hotels
and leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sectors of the London stock market currently most favoured by
institutional investors are engineering, hotels and leisure and other
industrial companies, according to a survey by Smith New Court, the
stockbrokers.
Sectors least favoured by investors are oil and gas, health and household,
contracting and construction, and property.
The survey of 97 institutional investors, collectively managing Pounds 610bn
of funds, was carried out by Gallup last week as the FT-SE 100 index was
close to a record high.
The biggest swing in institutional attitudes since the last survey in July
is reserved for the health and household sector which was then most favoured
by the investors.
While the contracting and construction and property sectors remain deeply
out of favour, both have swung back in relative terms and are now only
marginally less favoured on balance than the food manufacturing, telephone
networks, electricity and water sectors.
On broader economic issues, the institutions overwhelmingly believe there
will be a net increase in taxation in the spring budget to help fund the
public sector borrowing requirement. Some 45 per cent think the net increase
in taxation will be between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2.5bn.
The report is in line with City opinion that suggests VAT may be extended to
cover books, newspapers, fuel and possibly public transport.
A growing number of the institutions also believe that the general UK
economy will improve over the next year. They expected growth in GDP of 1.2
per cent in 1993 and 2 per cent in 1994.
Base rates are expected to be 6.5 per cent in 12 months time; annual
inflation is forecast to be 3.7 per cent in December and 4.4 per cent at the
end of 1994.

shares on the same terms.
In the six months to March 31 turnover at West came to Pounds 3.76m (Pounds
7.74m) and profit to Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 36,000). Earnings per share were
0.02p (0.06p).

Pounds 2.8m to repay loans made by Hanson in 1988 at the start of the
conglomerate's life.
One of the conditions on the loan to Mr Miller, a former personal assistant
to Lord Hanson, and his colleagues, was that the loan should be repayed as
soon as the Wassall share price exceeded 200p.
The share price jumped above that level during Wassall's bid for Evode, when

memo of understanding.
Final detailed negotiations are now under way on the precise level of
investment needed to secure LBC's future, although it is certain to be
several million pounds.
As a result of the deal it is believed that Chelverton and the LBC
management will hold a majority of the London radio station. Much of the
rest of the equity will be owned by Crown's banks in exchange for debt.
Little will then be left of Crown.
The investment is likely to come in two tranches. The first will be risk
capital designed to secure LBC's future until the re-advertising of its
franchise next year. The most substantial amount will be in the form of
longer term commitments to enable the station to retain its franchise.
It is also possible that other members of the Porter family may invest in
LBC.
Mr Christopher Chataway would remain chairman of LBC for the foreseeable
future but Mr Porter's mother, the controversial politician Dame Shirley
Porter, might eventually succeed him.
The main thrust behind the injection of new money into LBC, which has been
increasing its market share in London, is coming from Mr Porter.
The LBC deal is expected to leave the present management team in place
including Mr David Haynes as chief executive.
If LBC regains its franchise the Porter family may decide to use it as a
base from which to bid for the third national commercial radio licence. This
will be a speech station.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rank quashes film sale rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RANK ORGANISATION, the leisure and enter-tainments group, yesterday moved to
quash speculation over the fate of its film interests.
'Recently these rumours have increased in numbers and decibels,' a statement
from the board read. 'We believe . . . it is in the shareholders' interests
to say clearly and unequivocally that our film and television interests are
not for sale.'
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, reinforced the statement: 'The
businesses are not for sale - end of story.' Rank knew of no creditable
offers, he added.
However, the consortium which has sparked the recent speculation issued a
statement of its own which threw some doubt on Mr Gifford's exact meaning.
Premier Media, which is being advised by Chemical Bank, said it was aware
the businesses had not been put up for sale, but 'if a realistic offer is
made, the board of Rank would have to consider the proposal seriously'. Mr
Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, has agreed to become a
non-executive director of the new company if a sale is agreed.
Analysts tended to agree with Premier's interpretation, in light of Rank's
efforts to reduce its roughly Pounds 1bn debt through a series of asset
disposals.
'I bet if you came along and said there's Pounds 450m . . . Michael Gifford
would not say go away,' said one analyst. 'I just think he does not fancy
the chances of this consortium getting the money together.'
Rank announces its results tomorrow with analysts expecting profits of
between Pounds 233m and Pounds 245m, against Pounds 254m last time. Smith
New Court estimates that the film businesses will have contributed Pounds
29m, after some Pounds 12m losses in the video distribution operation.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Modest gain for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR appreciated about  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in European
trading yesterday, but was pushed down again after Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury Secretary Designate, said the US had to reassert leadership in the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations, writes James Blitz.
Mr Bentsen may have depressed the US currency at his nomination hearings,
because his statement gave some strength to recent speculation that the G7
might act to put a cap on the recent rise in the dollar at a time when the
US is trying to boost its trade position.
At the start of European trading, the dollar made modest headway against the
German currency, partly due to the relative calm in the exchange rate
mechanism. The US unit peaked at DM1.6350 in London, also helped by
continuing tensions in the Middle East, which tend to be positive for the
dollar.
However, an analyst sugg-ested that the dollar will probably be confined to
tight range-trading in the run-up to Mr Bill Clinton's inaugur-ation as US
President later this month. There is growing uncertainty as to whether Mr
Clinton will announce a major fiscal package at the start of his presidency
to stimulate the economy.
The US currency's recent gains had partly been the result of expectations
that a fiscal stimulus would bring higher US interest rates, but recent
signs of strength in the US economy are starting to undermine this view.
The dollar ended in London slightly firmer at DM1.6320 compared with a
previous close of DM1.6305. It finished unchanged from the London level in
New York at DM1.6320.
The D-Mark again showed little new strength inside the European exchange
rate mechanism. The French franc rose to a six-week high against the German
currency, helped by news that France's inflation rate was at its lowest
level since 1956.
With the year-on-year inflation level down to 2.0 per cent, the franc moved
as high as FFr3.3924 per D-Mark, a point not seen since the end of November.
However, the currency later lost some ground to the D-Mark, finishing at
FFr3.395, up  1/2 centime on balance. An analyst pointed out that the low
inflation figure makes short-term interest rates in France, which are still
between 11 and 12 per cent, look very punishing.
There was less tension surrounding the Irish punt, which traded above its
floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder for the second day
running.
The only significant loser yesterday was sterling, which suffered a
2-pfennig fall against the German currency to close at DM2.5125. Speculative
selling orders from Scandinavia were cited as a factor behind the currency's
fall. After last week's 6-pfennig rally against the D-Mark, a technical
correction was to be expected.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell for the second day running yesterday after
a Bundesbank council member raised new doubts in the market about the speed
and scale of future interest rate cuts in Germany, writes James Blitz.
The March Euromark contract opened yesterday at 92.08, a level which prices
three-month D-Marks at 7.82 per cent by the spring. Three-month money was
trading yesterday at around 8.55 per cent.
The assumption that there will be a fall in rates of around 70 basis points
over the next two months was considered by one dealer to be 'fair value' for
the contract at the start of trading.
However, Mr Helmut Hesse, the Bundesbank council member for Bremen, dampened
sentiment by saying that the German central bank should not make big, rapid
interest rate cuts in view of the current inflationary trends in Germany.
The release of his speech, due to be delivered in the city of Bremen, helped
to push the March contract down to a close of 92.03 after it had risen as
high as 92.13 at one stage.
The June contract was worse hit, perhaps because, as one dealer put it, it
was far too bullish on rate cuts. The contract was finally 10 basis points
down at 92.88, at which level it prices three-month money at 7.12 per cent
in June.
There was little other news to affect the German market. Dealers already
know that the Bundesbank will intervene in the market today using a fixed
rate two-week repo of 8.60 per cent.
However, a dealer suggested that there will be interest in whether the
Bundesbank uses a variable rate repo below 8.60 per cent, when lending money
for one month.
French franc futures also fell back yesterday after a bullish start to
trading, which saw the March contract as high as 90.53.
The contract retreated to close at 90.35, pricing three-month French francs
at 9.65 per cent by the spring. Three-month French cash remained far higher
than this, however, finishing yesterday at around 11 3/8 per cent.
Short-dated sterling futures were slightly weaker after the Bank of England
announced the date for the next gilt auction as January 27. The March short
sterling contract declined 3 basis points to end at 93.26.

self-sufficiency in vegetable oils
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA HOPES to be self-sufficient in vegetable oils in the 1992-93 season,
which began in November, thanks to bumper domestic production of oilseeds.
Last year the country spent Dollars 68m of precious foreign exchange on
importing 160,000 tonnes of oils.
This year's optimism stems from an oilseeds production forecast of about
21.56m tonnes, up from 18.32m tonnes in 1991-92. Both the summer and winter
crops have turned out to be highly satisfactory. As a result oil
availability should rise to 6.11m tonnes from 5.24m tonnes.
The federal government's claim that the country has at last achieved
self-sufficiency in oils is being contested, however, by experts who point
out that Indian per capita consumption of oils and fats works out at about 7
kg, compared with the world average of nearly 15 kg.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize harvest at record
level up 27%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AGRICULTURE Department estimated yesterday that the 1992 US maize
harvest at a record high 9.48bn bushels, AP reports from Washington.
That amount would be more than 27 per cent above the 1991 crop and 2 per
cent above the Nov. 1 forecast.
The record-breaking yield of 131.4 bushels per acre exceeded the previous
record of 119.8 bushels per acre set in 1987. The 1992 yield was 22.8
bushels above the 1991 yield.
Farmers harvested 7.48bn bushels in 1991.
As livestock feed, maize is the largest and most important farm crop and is
essential for the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Production
of soyabeans, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated
at 2.2bn bushels in 1992, up 11 per cent compared with 1991 and one per cent
above the November forecast. Yield per acre averaged a record 37.6 bushels
per acre, up 13.5 bushels from 1991.
Sorghum for grain production was estimated at 884m bushels, up 51 per cent
from 1991.
Rice output totalled 179m cwt during 1992, 14 per cent above the 1991 total.
The Average yield was 5,722 lbs per acre, 48 per cent above the 1991
average.
Kevin Brown reports from Sydney: Australia reacted angrily yesterday to US
plans to sell 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan under the
Export Enhancement Program, which Washington claims is intended to combat
European Community export subsidies.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said Australia intended to
register 'very strong concern and anger' with Washington, which also sold
800,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan in October. He said the US
decision had been made on the basis of incorrect information that Australia
would be unable to meet a Pakistani order for 600,000 tonnes of wheat
because of the effects of bad weather on the Australian crop.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Power cuts hit aluminium
smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO ALUMINIUM smelters on the Pacific west coast of America are cutting
output because of power supply problems and the industry expects others to
follow.
Their supplier, the Bonneville Power Administration, is suffering from the
drought in the area and has told smelters it must cut their supplies by 25
per cent until the end of February. Analysts suggest that any smelters that
make cuts would not restore production for at least six months because of
the cost and complexity of shutting down pot lines.
There are 10 aluminium smelters in the area with a total annual capacity of
1.5m tonnes, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the western world's primary
aluminium output. However, one, Reynolds Metals' Troutdale smelter, has
already been temporarily closed because of low aluminium prices.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that, if all the remaining smelters
cut production by one quarter for six months it would take 150,000 tonnes
out of the market this year. 'That is not enough to sustain a price rally in
these markets and at a time when LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks are at
record levels.'
Mr MacMillan suggested that the possibility of production cuts in the
Pacific north west was already 'partly factored into the market price'. On
the London Metal Exchange yesterday the price of aluminium for delivery in
three months fell by Dollars 5 to Dollars 1,237.50 a tonne.
First to react to the power problems was the employee-owned Columbia
Aluminium Corporation, which said that by Friday it would shut down 45,000
tonnes of annual capacity at its 180,000-tonnes-a-year Goldendale,
Washington, smelter. Amax quickly followed by saying output would be cut by
25 per cent at its 272,000 tonnes-a-year smelter at Ferndale, Washington.
Alcoa said it would make a decision today about its 210,000-tonnes-a-year
Wenatchee smelter, which obtains half its power supply from the BPA. One
option would be closure of a 42,000-tonnes-a-year potline.
Kaiser, with two smelters - Mead (200,000 tonnes) and Tacoma (73,000 tonnes)
 -supplied by the BPA also said it was 'weighing the options'. The BPA said
its own problems were compounded by the recent decision to close the Trojan
nuclear power station, in which it has a 30 per cent interest.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton nominee worries the
midwest grain barons - A look at Mike Espy's credentials for the agriculture
secretaryship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MIKE Espy, the presidential nominee for the US agriculture secretaryship,
is one of the new breed Clinton Democrats, an articulate moderate, who
straddles the centre on the Democratic party's ideological spectrum and
promotes catfish farming as readily as grains, rice and cotton.
The free traders at the American Farm Bureau hailed his nomination by
President-elect Bill Clinton on the grounds that Mr Espy 'stood up for
agriculture against excessive environmental restrictions during his six
years in Congress.' They view it as a good sign that he attended the Uruguay
Round negotiations in Geneva, journeyed to Mexico to discuss the North
American free trade agreement, supported a balanced budget amendment, and
opposed grazing fee increases.
At the same time, Mr Espy won a 90 per cent rating for his support of
liberal farm programmes from the American Agriculture Movement. His
nomination - as the first black agriculture secretary in more than a century
 -was greeted with glee on the left, which considers the department he will
head as one of the most racist in the government for its dealings with both
black farmers and its own employees.
Ms Kathy Ozer, a spokesman for the National Family Farm Coalition, praised
Mr Espy's efforts to raise farm prices and shift the sector into
'sustainable agriculture'. Although he supported an extension of the
president's 'fast-track' authority to continue negotiations on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement -
which many liberal farm groups opposed - he also voted for their amendment,
declaring that no trade pacts would be accepted by Congress unless they were
in the interest of workers, farmers and the environment.
Any grumbling about the appointment has been muted. But midwesterners, who
have come to regard the US Department of Agriculture as their own, are
seriously worried about the nominee's commitment to grains. One aide to a
north-western senator said the crops grown in the US south - like peanuts,
cotton, tobacco and rice - were among the most protected by the entrenched
southern senators and congressmen and needed the advantage of a sympathetic
agriculture secretary the least.
Agribusiness interests are concerned about Mr Espy's lack of experience with
export-oriented agriculture. Aside from catfish and family farms, 'he has no
track record in agriculture', says Mr Daniel Basse, an Illinois grain
analyst and farm consultant.' He's an unknown. . . The farm community
doesn't know what he will do for farm income and farm exports.'
The fiercest of Mr Espy's critics in the midwestern agribusiness community
are gossiping that he might be eliminated in the confirmation process,
eagerly offering off-the-record comments about his personal life. Having few
allies in large-scale agriculture and facing Senate republicans who might
pounce on the rumours as revenge for the rejection of Senator John Tower,
President Bush's first nominee for the defence secretaryship, on the grounds
of his personal conduct, Mr Espy may face an uphill confirmation battle. One
farm consultant said: 'If the republicans are going to derail anyone, they
might well try Espy, but the Democratic majority is strong enough to
withstand anything but a major attack'.
Mr Garland West, spokesman for Cargill, the Minnesota-based agribusiness
conglomerate, said midwesterners were waiting to see other USDA appointments
before making judgments about Mr Espy's impact. 'The USDA is a bureaucracy,
and we expect there will be a strong cast of supporting players,' Mr West
said. 'Everyone in agriculture is waiting to see the whole picture, which
you don't get from one appointment.'
Mr Espy, 39, from the Mississippi Delta, has represented one of the poorest
regions in the country in the House of Representatives. His family was
prominent and comparatively wealthy, and, as he said in his acceptance
statement, his father, 'fresh out of college with a degree in agriculture',
served as an USDA extension agent in Arkansas.
He has had little to say about the most controversial issues in US
agriculture - the desirability of high farm supports, export subsidies and
agricultural trade liberalisation within Gatt. But he has noted that with
new technologies, globalisation of trade and economies of scale in farm
operations, 'things never will really be the same down on the farm'.
The USDA bureaucracy has grown, while the number of farmers has dropped, he
said. It 'frustrates' rather than 'advocates'. Its factual information must
be improved and its priorities shifted towards the eradication of hunger and
finding new overseas markets for 'our incredible agricultural production'.
Although increased farm exports will be a goal under Mr Espy, he shares Mr
Clinton's passion for new ideas.
He intends to work for the development of community development banks in
rural areas, to encourage more crop diversification and to promote more
value-added production in the US.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yeltsin appoints energy
minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has finally filled the vacancy of fuel and
energy minister by appointing Mr Yuri Shafranik, the powerful governor of
Tyumen, Russia's richest oil-producing region.
The president's office said last night that Mr Yeltsin had made the
appointment on the recommendation of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, himself deputy
prime minister responsible for energy policy until he was elected prime
minister last month. The fuel and energy post had been vacant since Mr
Vladimir Lopukhin was sacked last June.
Mr Chernomyrdin, manager of the Gasprom gas monopoly until he joined the
government in June, has made a shrewd choice in that Mr Shafranik had always
fiercely defended the right of the regions to determine policy rather than
simply follow Moscow's commands. As a poacher turned gamekeeper, Mr
Shafranik will have a head start in supervising the country's fragmented oil
industry and getting on with the so-called 'oil generals' who run
state-owned enterprises whose size rivals the biggest western oil companies.
The centralised and more successful gas industry will continue to run itself
as a single monopoly concern encompassing gas production in other former
Soviet republics.
Mr Shafranik's main task will be to try to stem a fall in oil output, which
has continued for more than three years, despite preliminary ministry
figures showing a 22 per cent increase in lucrative hard currency exports
last year to 66.2m tonnes. Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, deputy minister for fuel
and energy, said yesterday that production of oil and gas condensate in 1992
had fallen nearly 15 per cent to around 393m tonnes. In contrast, gas
production had fallen just 0.5 per cent to 640bn cubic metres.
Mr Shafranik will also have to grapple with a complex programme for the
limited privatisation of oil enterprises preserving state control of a key
Russian source of foreign exchange. The coal industry meanwhile is badly in
need of restructuring and a political tinder box. The miners were
instrumental in undermining the rulers of the old Soviet Union with
political strikes.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vietnamese rice exports up 30
per cent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VIETNAMESE RICE exports rose by about 30 per cent last year to 1.4m tonnes,
consolidating the country's position as the world's third largest rice
exporter after Thailand and the US, official figures show.
Total Vietnamese rice production in 1992 rose by 1.6m tonnes to 21.5m
despite the floods that damaged crops in some areas, according to an
official newspaper.
The figures suggest that Vietnam has overcome problems caused by the
disruption in fertiliser supplies that followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union, once Hanoi's principal foreign backer and aid donor.
The report in the Sunday Vietnam News said farmers had boosted rice
production by planting high-yield varieties and using more modern farming
techniques, as well as by drawing on government credit lines to the tune of
about Dollars 100m.
More than half the loans went to farmers in the fertile southern Mekong
delta, and they produced about 11m tonnes of the year's output.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Depressed oil market resumes
slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES slid further yesterday amid heavy selling from North Sea
producers. North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery declined by 45
cents from Dollars 17.55 to Dollars 17.10 a barrel and traders saw little
prospect of any uplifting news in weeks to come.
Much of Norway's crude output is still shut in because of severe storms and
tankers are facing difficulties loading oil in the UK sector of the North
Sea. But these shutdowns have failed to lend any strength to prices while
traders keep their sights fixed on overproduction by the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects Opec's January
output to be the same as its December level of over 25m barrels a day. He
estimates that the producers' club will have to cut back by at least 1m b/d
in February to bring oil prices back into line. 'The only thing the market
can hope is that prices drop far enough to frighten Opec into action,' he
said yesterday.
Mr Pyne believes North Sea prices will drop to Dollars 16 a barrel within
weeks.
Prices for Brent crude have lost over Dollars 1 a barrel since the beginning
of the year as even token Opec cuts in production have failed to
materialise. There could be some modest increases in demand towards the end
of the year - of around 1.5 per cent in the US and 1 per cent in Europe.
Added to low levels of demand, stocks of oil products remain high. The
winter has not been cold enough for producers to work off the high stocks
they built in the fourth quarter of last year.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US wheat sale plan angers
Australia

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA REACTED angrily yesterday to US plans to sell 500,000 tonnes of
subsidised wheat to Pakistan under the Export Enhancement Program, which
Washington claims is intended to combat European Community export subsidies.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said Australia intended to
register 'very strong concern and anger' with Washington, which also sold
800,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan in October. He said the US
decision had been made on the basis of incorrect information that Australia
would be unable to meet a Pakistani order for 600,000 tonnes of wheat
because of the effects of bad weather on the Australian crop.
Australia supported US attempts to reduce the distorting effect of EC export
subsidies and owed a debt to Washington for securing a breakthrough against
European opposition in the Uruguay Round talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, Mr Crean admitted. However, he said it 'makes no sense'
for the US to sell subsidised wheat to Pakistan because the EC was not a
significant alternative supplier.
Mr John Lawrenson, director of the Australian Wheat Board, said the deal was
'a cynical attempt by the US to capitalise on the current problems in the
Australian wheat harvest'.
He described the deal as 'needless, senseless blow to Australian wheat
farmers', which 'calls into question the US commitment to free trade and to
Australia's export earning capacity'.
The wheat board said recently that more than 40 per cent of the Australian
crop might have to be downgraded because of damage caused by severe weather
in late December. The board said sufficient milling wheat would be produced
to meet the Pakistani order, but it expected Pakistan to accept the offer of
cheaper US grain.

COPPER prices ended an active and volatile LME session weak, but above the
lows of a wide range. Copper also unsettled the other metals, which closed
lower. Dealers said the steep falls in copper, following Monday's decline,
reflected heavy Chinese selling that became a deluge of long liquidation and
speculative sales as the market's recent uptrend came to a halt. Some GOLD
dealers on the London bullion market saw news that the Dutch central bank
sold 400 tonnes last year as slightly bullish. 'If a substantial element of
it went to the market, then it may well be felt that the market held up
surprisingly well,' one dealer said. On Comex gold futures were firmer in
late trading but below the key Dollars 330 a troy ounce level breached
earlier. London COCOA futures finished with gains of up to Pounds 16 a tonne
with the market boosted by the weakness of sterling against other leading
currencies. Dealers said Ivorian sellers' were further from the market
following the pound's slump.

FT  13 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Further setback for gilts as Bank
announces auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK gilts market was dealt a further setback yesterday, when the Bank of
England announced a gilt auction for January 27.
Despite the fact that the auction was widely anticipated, the market fell
back on the news, ending about  1/4 point lower. Dealers said that at recent
auctions the margin by which bids have covered the gilts on offer had
narrowed, exacerbating concern about the government's ability to meet its
heavy funding needs.
The amount and terms of the auction of stock maturing between 2005 and 2013
will be announced next Tuesday.
Supply remains the main focus for the gilts market, which continued to
underperform other European bond markets yesterday.
However, prior to the auction news, the market had appeared more buoyant.
The release of the December producer price index proved mildly positive for
the market. The year-on-year rise of 3.5 per cent was broadly in line with
inflation, while the 0.1 per increase in import prices in December was not
as bad as had been feared.
'Inflation is not the problem at the moment. The market would rather see
growth, even at cost of some inflation,' as it advances the prospect of an
easing in the government's funding needs, according to Mr Michael Burke,
economist at Yamaichi International.
THE French market recovered some of Monday's losses in a largely technical
rally, but the performance of the French bond market so far this year,
widely tipped to be the strongest European market in the early 1993, remains
rather disappointing. The spread between French government OAT and German
bund yields is still above 90 basis points, defying expectations that it
would narrow substantially.
Dealers say nervousness over the forthcoming election accounts for the
underperformance of the market.
However, sentiment was slightly raised yesterday by news that in December
inflation fell to 2 per cent year-on-year, and is widely expected to fall
further. However, dealers said that good news on the inflation front would
not be enough to support the market.
THE bund market ended virtually unchanged, with prices caught in a narrow
range due to uncertainty over interest rate movements.
There was little comfort in news that average inflation for 1992 reached 4
per cent, the highest for 10 years, up from 3 1/2 per cent in 1991.
THE pressures of fresh supply and reports of strong retail sales depressed
US Treasury securities yesterday, with prices falling across the maturity
range.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at
101 3/4 , yielding 7.471 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was also lower, down  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.456 per
cent.
Although dealers reported that the downward pressure from heavy issues of
new corporate debt had eased somewhat from last week, prices remained
restrained by supply concerns.
In addition, securities sold by the Province of Ontario and North Carolina
Easter Municipal Power, which together totalled Dollars 4.6bn in new
fixed-income debt, have come to the market, weakening seven-year and 10-year
paper as dealers sold the Treasury securities to hedge against long
corporate positions.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Equity Issues: Grupo Carso plans to test
investors with Dollars 350m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO Carso, the Mexican holding company with interests ranging from tobacco
to telecommunications, is preparing to raise about Dollars 350m with an
international equity offering.
The deal will prove an important test of investor appetite for Mexican
shares after several companies were forced to abandon plans for equity
offerings in the summer due to market conditions.
Grupo Carso, a listed company, has stakes in several Mexican companies,
including Cigatam, which manufactures and sells cigarettes, Condumex, which
makes wires and cables, Nacobre, which makes copper and alloy products, and
Sanborns, a retail store and restaurant group. It also owns 5.5 per cent of
Telmex, the telecom group. Baring Brothers and Merrill Lynch will act as
joint global co-ordinators.
Investment bankers expect the issue to be quite well received now that stock
market conditions have stabilised. Last summer, several Mexican companies
shelved plans for equity offerings following a steep fall in the Mexican
stock market and weak demand for Mexican paper from international investors
who had witnessed heavy losses on their Mexican investments.
Banamex - otherwise known as Banco Nacional de Mexico - was forced to
abandon a Dollars 1.4bn international equity offering last June. Banamex,
which is one of the leading banks in Mexico, was the first to test the water
again with a convertible bond issue last month.
Demand for its convertible bond issue was very strong and the deal was
increased from Dollars 350m to Dollars 565m, making it the largest
convertible bond issue from an emerging market. Banamex issued seven-year
subordinated exchangeable debentures which can be exchanged into shares in
Banacci, the quoted Mexican holding company which owns Banamex.
Gemex, the biggest bottler of Pepsi-Cola in Mexico, raised Dollars 186.5m
last month with an international equity offering, but Goldman Sachs, the
global co-ordinator, said the international tranche was scaled back while
the US tranche was increased in order to reflect investor demand.
Desc, an industrial conglomerate, is understood to be reconsidering tapping
the international equity markets with a Dollars 250m offering.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Italy takes advantage of
strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy took advantage of continuing strong international
demand for the D-Mark by increasing the amount of its five-year Eurobond to
DM5bn yesterday. Investors were attracted by the high coupons available and
the currency's strength, say bankers.
Italy, which priced the bonds near the bottom end of the indicated range at
47 basis points over German government bonds, increased the amount from
DM4bn.
Professor Alberto Giovannini, an adviser to the Italian Treasury, said he
was delighted with preliminary information on the geographic spread of
investors. Italy wanted to attract international investors rather than rely
on purely German demand.
Lead-manager Deutsche Bank, which took half of the paper on to its books,
said it sold only one-third into Germany, and that there was particularly
strong demand from UK institutions and central banks. The spread tightened
to 45 to 46 basis points by the end of the day, it said.
The most recent nearly comparable sovereign borrowing was the DM3bn
seven-year issue from the Republic of Finland, also rated AA+ by Standard &amp;
Poor's but one notch higher than Italy by Moody's, at AA2. Launched with a
spread of 53 basis points, it was increased from the original DM2bn at a
lower spread of 50 basis points. By yesterday, Finland's spread had widened
again to 53 basis points, said traders.
Of the five-year issues by Finland, Sweden and the UK last autumn, only the
UK's spread has widened while the others have narrowed. Traders say that in
retrospect the UK's launch spread of 10 basis points was too tight for a
DM5.5bn deal.
Deutsche Bank's active start to the year as a lead manager continued
yesterday, with two other new issues in dollars and D-Marks. Set for pricing
today is Credit Foncier de France's DM1.5bn 10-year issue, also led by
Deutsche Bank. The indicated spread is 20 basis points over German
government bonds.
DG Bank described the DM100m 10-year reverse floating rate notes it led for
Nordic Investment Bank as a speculative product targeted at retail investors
who believe German interest rates are set to be cut. It offers a coupon of
10 per cent for the first year and 19 1/2 per cent less two times six-month
Libor thereafter. While some bankers say that the D-Mark market now needs
time to absorb the recent heavy supply, others say there is no sign of
indigestion yet.
In the dollar sector, Deutsche Bank admitted that KfW's Dollars 500m
five-year issue was tightly priced at a launch spread of 18 basis points
over comparable US Treasuries, but said a shortage of quality paper at that
maturity helped the bonds sell well.
European Investment Bank's latest borrowing came in two tranches from S. G.
Warburg Securities, one for Dollars 400m over three years, the other for
Dollars 300m over seven years. Bankers thought it was wrong to give both the
same spread of 15 basis points over Libor. Interest, they said, was much
stronger in the three-year slice, which was fairly priced, than in the
seven-year, which was seen as expensive.
Goldman Sachs said the spread on the Province of Ontario's Dollars 3bn
10-year global issue tightened to 72 basis points, after being set at 76,
the bottom end of the indicated range. Goldman said that the deal was
oversubscribed, and confirmed that demand for around 60 per cent of the
paper came from the US market.
Yesterday saw the year's first batch of equity-related issues by Japanese
borrowers this year, the biggest of which was for Dollars 180m over four
years by Tokyo Construction Co. The cost of such issues is very low in yen
terms, say bankers, and many more are planned in the Japanese domestic
market and the Euromarkets to refinance the Dollars 75bn or so of warrant
bonds arranged in the late 1980s and maturing this year.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Beijing serves up red-hot chips
 -Citic's HKDollars 11.6bn asset shuffle to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER or not you believe some brokers' talk about Citic Pacific being the
'hong of the future', there is no getting around the fact that the Hong
Kong-listed subsidiary of Beijing's most important investment vehicle is the
reddest of 'red chip' stocks listed in Hong Kong.
Last Thursday, Citic Hong Kong injected a 12 per cent stake in Hongkong
Telecom, together with a controlling interest in two mainland power stations
and a 20 per cent share of a Hong Kong chemical waste management plant into
its 45 per cent-owned Citic Pacific.
The HKDollars 11.6bn (USDollars 1.5bn) deal - financed by a HKDollars 7.1bn
placement and HKDollars 3.7bn in loan facilities - should see Citic
Pacific's ranking in the colony's top 100 companies rise from 22nd place to
around 10th.
The deal has met with general approval. The sale of the stake in Hongkong
Telecom was done at HKDollars 7.8 a share - a near 20 per cent discount to
Hongkong Telecom's prevailing share price of HKDollars 9.70 at the time.
This has ensured that the acquisition for Citic Pacific will be broadly
neutral in terms of its earnings per share and makes good a promise by Citic
Hong Kong that any sale it makes to its listed subsidiary will not put
minority shareholders at a disadvantage.
But last week's transaction has raised some questions in the Hong Kong
market as to the deal's timing and the impact the acquisitions will have on
Citic Pacific's desire to be seen as a manager and operator of businesses
rather than just a passive investor in blue chip stocks. Along with Hongkong
Telecom, it also owns 12 per cent of Cathay Pacific, nearly half of Dragon
Air, and 20 per cent of Macao's telecommunications monopoly.
Citic Pacific is an unusual company by most western standards. It is the
listed subsidiary of China International Trust and Investment Corporation -
the first green shoot of China's economic revolution initiated by Deng
Xiaoping in 1978 and arguably the most important western-style company in
China today. Citic's chairman, Mr Rong Yiren, is also the father of Mr Larry
Yung, the head of Citic's operations in Hong Kong.
The Beijing parent's main aim is to assist in the modernisation of the
Chinese economy through investment primarily internationally which will lead
to the transfer of technology and management know-how to China. Citic Hong
Kong, and its listed vehicle, Citic Pacific, has a different role.
As Mr Yung explains: 'Citic Hong Kong is different from Citic Beijing. The
main difference is independence. I can invest in China: I have the power,
the money and the people.'
Mr Yung has deployed these enviable resources with the aim of building up
Citic Hong Kong and Pacific into a conglomerate that is arguably the most
exposed of any leading company in Hong Kong to the Chinese market.
He believes that, in some quarters, last week's transaction was
misunderstood. As to timing, he maintains the moment was propitious because
of the relative performance of both Hongkong Telecom and Citic Pacific in
the wake of the stock market's reaction to the row between the UK and China
over democracy in Hong Kong.
He also scoffs at any suggestion that his superior connections in Beijing
gave him any foreknowledge of destabilising rows to some. 'If the future
held no hope, why do a new issue? Citic Hong Kong has increased its stake in
Citic Pacific and I also personally subscribed to 30m shares,' he says.
More seriously, he suggests that the question of the company's focus is
largely based on ignorance. Firstly, Citic Pacific is not a passive
investor. Its purchase of Cathay Pacific led, he claims, to the creation of
Dragon Air - a Citic/Cathay joint venture which services mainland air routes
out of Hong Kong and some regional destinations.
Mr Yung agrees that Hongkong Telecom is likely to account for around 40 per
cent of Citic's market capitalisation and around 30 per cent of profits in a
full year. But the relationship with Cathay shows that new businesses can be
created. If China were to relax its rules on foreign participation in its
domestic telecommunications market then Citic/Hongkong Telecom would be well
placed to exploit it, he said.
In Hong Kong, the company most associated with privately-owned power
generation in China is Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings. Citic Hong Kong's
transfer of its interest in two power stations in China - one in Henan
province the other in Jiangsu province - may lead to a re-evaluation of that
view.
Mr Yung - who from 1964 until 1978 worked as an engineer with the Ministry
of Water and Power - believes that Citic's capabilities in power generation
are unparalleled in China. It has 46 executives - six in Hong Kong and 40 in
its Beijing office - working on power plants in China.
'As (China's) minister of water and power told me, it is a star team. Our
engineers, construction people and plant managers are the best in China.
Many are previous class mates of mine and my former bosses.'
Citic Pacific acquired the interests in the two power stations at cost. It
will pay HKDollars 530m for 56 per cent of the Jiangsu Ligang power station
 -located in Wuxi, Mr Yung's ancestral home town - and HKDollars 360m for 50
per cent of the Xinli power station in Henan province. Both are expected to
come on stream this year.
Ownership of these facilities lasts for 15 years, at which time they are
transferred to the state. But Citic Pacific has the right to participate in
future expansion plans which envisage the doubling in size of both
facilities and would give it a further 15-year interest.
Citic Hong Kong is currently negotiating with the Shanghai authorities to
build in Pudong four 300MW coal-fired units as the first stage of a 3,200MW
facility.
Mr Yung is also keen to point out that through Da Chong Hong, a trading
company it acquired a year ago, he has expanded car sales to China and is
expanding its retail activities as well. With this sort of involvement in
China, Mr Yung can be forgiven for feeling aggrieved by the accusation that
Citic is just a corporate rentier.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Black's bid to raise Fairfax
stake is delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday deferred for 90 days a decision on
whether to allow Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group to increase its
stake in the Fairfax newspaper chain from 14.33 per cent to 25 per cent.
The deferral means the government may not have to rule on the
politically-sensitive application until after the next federal election,
which is likely to be called within three months.
The application is believed to have support from some ministers, although it
is unclear whether Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, is sympathetic to
Mr Black's claim that Fairfax requires a strong main shareholder.
There is strong opposition in the ruling Labor party's parliamentary caucus
to any relaxation of the existing foreign investment guidelines, which limit
overseas ownership of newspapers to 20 per cent.
The guidelines were imposed by the caucus before the sale of Fairfax to a
consortium led by the Telegraph in December 1991. Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US
investment bank, owns 5 per cent of Fairfax.
Mr Dawkins is expected to produce a report to the federal Cabinet arguing
that ministers should put their collective weight behind a request to the
caucus to relax the rules. But Mr Neil O'Keefe, chairman of the caucus
transport and communications committee, said the government would have
difficulty in winning backbench support. 'There certainly would be
substantial opposition to it,' he said.
Mr Barry Jones, federal president of the Labor party, urged Mr Dawkins to
take into account the 'broader issue' of the need to reduce the
concentration of media ownership in Australia.
Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and
the Australian Financial Review, is responsible for about 20 per cent of
daily newspaper circulation. About 70 per cent is controlled by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Kodak stock up sharply on
outside appointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company with a lacklustre
earnings record, rose sharply yesterday following news that it had appointed
a chief financial officer from outside the group with a reputation for
turning around poorly-performing businesses.
He is Mr Christopher Steffen, 50, who resigned before Christmas as chief
financial officer of Honeywell, the controls business. He will succeed Mr
Paul Smith, 57, who retired last month.
Honeywell's stock fell substantially on his departure, while Kodak's soared
Dollars 3.25 to Dollars 45 on Wednesday following his appointment. It rose a
further Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 at close of trade yesterday as Wall
Street analysts raised their ratings and earning estimates for the group.
This is the first time in two decades Kodak has gone outside the company to
fill a senior executive position, and analysts took this as a sign it will
start taking a more aggressive approach to its difficulties.
The group has suffered for years from stagnant demand in its core
photographic products business, while diversification into new fields,
notably its Dollars 5.1bn 1988 takeover of Sterling Drug, has failed to give
revenues and earnings a sustained lift. The company has taken six
restructuring charges in the past seven years.
However, under Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman since 1990, Kodak has started
demonstrating a more urgent pace of change in recent months.
In November it announced plans to sell three non-core businesses, including
its Atex computer systems operation, as part of a scheme to divest 10
operations. The company has declined to comment on market rumours that it
may be preparing a substantial round of job cuts.
Mr Steffen, who joined Honeywell in 1989, is credited with playing a
significant role alongside Mr James Renier, the chairman, in improving that
company's performance. He had previously worked in senior positions at
Chrysler,the car manufacturer. He will start at Kodak on February 8.
Mr Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said he had raised
his earnings estimate for the company in 1993 from Dollars 3.65 a share to
Dollars 3.85, and in 1994 from Dollars 4.10 to Dollars 4.40. Analysts
forecasts for 1993 are currently pitched around Dollars 3.85.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T steps up dispute with MCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph has broadened its technology patents dispute
with MCI Communications by filing a patent infringement suit against the
rival telecommunications company, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The AT&amp;T suit follows MCI's earlier action seeking a court ruling that
certain AT&amp;T patents were not enforceable.
AT&amp;T said it had been negotiating with MCI since 1988, seeking a two per
cent royalty on some of the patents. These cover 800 (toll-free) service
enhancements, credit card processing and verification techniques, and
techniques for controlling toll-fraud abuse and branding several types of
telephone calls with an audible company slogan.
AT&amp;T is seeking royalties and damages for MCI's allegedly unauthorised use
of patented technologies over the past five years, as well as prospective
future use.
'We simply will not allow MCI to continue to get a free ride on our Dollars
3bn annual investment in research and development,' said Ms Judith Maynes, a
lawyer for AT&amp;T.
The dispute first surfaced after MCI announced an alliance with Stentor, the
Canadian telecommunications consortium, in November.
AT&amp;T informed MCI and Stentor that their proposed use of MCI's intelligent
network technology in Canada would infringe upon AT&amp;T patents.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US paper group which has been expanding fast in
Europe, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 176m, after
taking a Dollars 263m after-tax charge for a productivity improvement
programme.
The company said the results worked through at a loss of Dollars 1.46 a
share and were struck on sales of Dollars 3.4bn. Without the charges,
earnings totalled Dollars 87m, or 71 cents a share.
In the fourth quarter of 1991 the company earned Dollars 107m, or 96 cents a
share, before special charges and Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share, after
charges.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said the company had achieved fourth-quarter
sales comparable to the second and third quarters, despite difficult
conditions in both the US and European economies.
'Weak prices continued to hamper earnings in pulp, coated and uncoated
printing and writing papers.
'Ongoing strong performances were seen, however, in timber and wood products
businesses.'
Pulp and paper saw sales up from Dollars 970m to Dollars 995m, while
paperboard and packaging rose from Dollars 870m to Dollars 895m and
distribution from Dollars 685m to Dollars 735m. Specialty products ware up
from Dollars 485m to Dollars 545m, while timber and wood products were
unchanged at Dollars 350m.
For the full year, International Paper reported net earnings of Dollars 86m,
or 71 cents a share, after special charges and Dollars 405m, or Dollars 3.34
a share, before charges.
Sales totalled Dollars 13.6bn, up from Dollars 12.7bn in 1991.
Net earnings in 1991 totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after
special charges and Dollars 452m, or Dollars 4.09 a share before charges.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Buoyant Paramount lifts net
income to Dollars 261.4m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG recovery in movie and television profits helped Paramount
Communications, the publishing, entertainment and theme parks group, to
achieve a 21.7 per cent rise in its net income, to Dollars 101.4m, in the
fourth quarter of its fiscal year, ended October 31.
For the whole of Paramount's fiscal 1992, net earnings were more than
doubled - from Dollars 122.2m to Dollars 261.4m. Earnings per share for the
full year were Dollars 2.19, against Dollars 1.03 last time.
The company stressed yesterday that while it expected earnings momentum to
continue in fiscal 1993, comparisons with its exceptional motion picture
results in the early part of last year would prove to be unfavourable.
Last year's earnings, struck on Dollars 4.26bn of total revenues, up from
Dollars 3.9bn, benefited from substantial operating income from box office
successes such as Wayne's World. Paramount said it also had a sharp
improvement operating income from television programming.
Results from theatre operations declined, while Madison Square Garden did
better in 1992 thanks to proceeds from The New York Knickerbockers
basketball team as well as income from last July's Democratic National
Convention.
The publishing division, which includes Simon and Schuster, turned in
operating income of Dollars 182m, against Dollars 156.2m in 1991.
Although a breakdown was not supplied, Paramount also said results were
sharply higher in the business and professional publishing sector, primarily
due to contributions from Prentice Hall Computer Publishing, acquired in
November 1991.
Last summer, Paramount signalled plans to diversify its holdings when it
agreed to pay Dollars 400m to buy a string of US theme parks.

TWO of Europe's satellite television sports channels, Eurosport and Screen
Sport are to merge.
The deal, signed yesterday, unites companies such as TF1, the French first
channel, Canal Plus, the French subscription channel, and ESPN, the US

will be a separate shareholding structure for the French channel with Canal
Plus owning 34 per cent, TF1 31 per cent, Generale D'Image 25 per cent and
ESPN with 10 per cent.
The new channel will concentrate on sports such as football, tennis,

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zenith chief executive in
surprise move to Digital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Enrico Pesatori, formerly president and chief executive of Zenith Data
Systems, is taking charge of the personal computer division of Digital
Equipment Corporation.
The move reflects an abrupt change of culture at the US minicomputer maker
as it fights to return to profitable growth.
He will be replaced at Zenith by Mr Jacques Noels, president of Nokia
Consumer Electronics of Finland.
Mr Pesatori, 52, has been at Zenith for the past two years, joining after
its acquisition by Groupe Bull of France. An accomplished technologist, he
is widely credited with having refocused Zenith's product line and creating
partnership deals, including an agreement with IBM through which the US
computer group is marketing Zenith's portable computers.
His move to Digital comes as a surprise; it is understood he was made a
tempting offer to become general manager of DEC's personal computer business
unit.
Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's newly-appointed chief executive, said Mr
Pesatori would be responsible for establishing Digital as a 'growing and
profitable force in the world PC market'.
To date, Digital has been comparatively unsuccessful in PCs. It came into
the market late with uncompetitive products and has only recently started to
recover lost ground.
Mr Palmer's appointment of an outsider to such an important position would
have been unlikely under his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Olsen, and is an
indication of a sea change at Digital.
Last week, Mr Palmer appointed Mr John Klein, an IBM employee of 25 years'
standing, to head Digital's consumer business unit.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Record earnings at Fannie Mae
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
record fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 1992, and forecast the US
residential property market would rebound strongly during 1993.
The company, which is the largest mortgage provider in the US, reported net
income of Dollars 426.4m for the final quarter of 1992, the 20th consecutive
record-breaking quarter for the company.
In the corresponding three-month period of 1991, Fannie Mae earned Dollars
361m.
The latest results meant Fannie Mae's 1992 profits reached a record Dollars
1.62bn, up 19 per cent on the Dollars 1.363bn earned in the previous year.
Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman, said 1992 had been an 'exceptional'
year for the company, but added 1993 should be even better, forecasting that
it would be the strongest year for home sales since 1979.
A number of factors were behind Fannie Mae's earnings last year, including a
big increase in the size of the company's net mortgage portfolio, which
jumped 23 per cent to Dollars 156bn, and a 20 per cent increase in the
balance of outstanding mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to Dollars 445bn.
During the year, Fannie Mae issued a record Dollars 194bn of MBS, almost
double the previous year's total.
The company was also helped by record fees from sales of Remics (real estate
mortgage investment conduits), which reached Dollars 87m and by its
long-standing practice of issuing callable debt, which boosted earnings at a
time when portfolio liquidations were running high.
Net interest income for the year was Dollars 2.05bn, up 16 per cent from
1991, despite the fact that Fannie Mae's net interest margin fell from 142
basis points in 1991 to 137 basis points, primarily because of a big
increase in short-term investment balances.
Provisions set aside for losses were Dollars 320m last year, down from
Dollars 370m in 1991 because of accounting changes. Charge-offs to the
company's allowance for loan losses rose 29 per cent to Dollars 244m - the
result of the growth in MBS and portfolio balances and weak economies in
California and New England.

301m and a 21 per cent rise in fee income to Dollars 228m. Bad debt

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Chrysler, the financially-stretched US car manufacturer, dipped
yesterday morning in reaction to its plan to bolster its balance sheet by
raising some Dollars 1.4bn through an international offering of 40m new
shares. Chrysler announced the share issue after the New York Stock Exchange
closed on Monday night.
It wants to take advantage of its buoyant share price, which has more than
trebled since the start of 1992, thanks to a line of new products which has
won widespread praise on Wall Street and an enthusiastic response from
consumers.
The new shares will mean a 14 per cent addition to the 295m Chrysler shares
outstanding, so the company's stock dropped Dollars 1 1/2 in morning trading
yesterday to stand at Dollars 34 7/8 at midday.
However, the issue was welcomed by the leading US credit rating agencies,
Moody's and Standard and Poor's, which both upgraded the company's debt,
citing both the new equity and Chrysler's more competitive product range.
However, Chrysler's debt still ranks below the investment grade rating given
to the most financially-secure companies.
Chrysler's last share issue was in the autumn of 1991, when it raised
Dollars 354m through a sale of 35m shares.
Chrysler's ability to sell shares contrasts with its position three years
ago, when it was in such strained financial health heading into a severe US
recession, that analysts questioned if it could survive as an independent
company.
It has bounced back thanks to its new products, a re-organisation of the way
it makes cars, a strenuous attack on costs across the group and the disposal
of peripheral interests.
However, the company's finances remained stretched. Chrysler said last night
the new shares were part of a plan to strengthen its financial condition,
increase its liquidity and add to its equity base.
Analysts said that without new equity the company had looked unlikely to
generate sufficient cash from operations during the current upswing in the
business cycle to meet two ambitions. Firstly, to cut its unfunded pension
liabilities, which stand at around Dollars 4bn, by around Dollars 2bn, and
to build up a Dollars 5bn cash reserve which will enable it to keep funding
its product development programme - expected to total Dollars 17.3bn over
the next five years - even if the market turns down again.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank unveils details of
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, the smallest of Germany's big three commercial banks, yesterday
unveiled the details of its long-awaited rights issue.
This will be Commerzbank's first rights issue since 1986.
The bank said it would be offering one new share for every 11 held at a
price of DM200 per share.
Yesterday, the company's shares responded by falling DM1.9 on the Frankfurt
bourse to close at DM241.10.
The rights issue - which is likely to raise DM500m (Dollars 314.4m) cash for
the bank - has been expected since last May when shareholders gave
Commerzbank the right to raise nominal capital by DM400m.
The rights issue is worth a nominal DM125m, or 2.5m new shares.
In spite of strong growth in profits last year, the bank has lower capital
ratios than its competitors.
Analysts said yesterday that this issue would take core equity capital above
the threshold set for new capital adequacy ratios which took effect at the
beginning of the year.
Total equity capital of the bank will be DM9.7bn after the issue.

SWISS VOLKSBANK, the object of an agreed SFr1.5bn (Dollars 1.04bn) share
exchange takeover bid by CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse,
has appointed Mr Kurt Widmer, until now a member of the executive board of
Credit Suisse, as its chief executive.
The move follows the sudden resignation of Mr Walter Ruegg after the
takeover was announced last Wednesday.
Mr Ruegg said then that he supported the takeover, because the future of
Volksbank as an independent bank looked bleak.
However, since he had committed himself to trying to keep Volksbank
independent, he felt he should resign and make way for a Credit Suisse
appointee.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: KIO bid to sell Ebro stake runs
into difficulties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BID by the Kuwait Investment Office to sell its controlling stake in the
profitable domestic food company Ebro ran into difficulties yesterday when
Mr Javier de la Rosa, the KIO's former chief Spanish executive, threatened
to block the deal.
Mr de la Rosa, who owns 12 per cent of Ebro and is at the centre of a
lawsuit over the KIO's troubled investment in Spain, issued a writ claiming
he hadthe right to buy the 36 per cent stake in Ebro.
Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company which applied for
receivership last month claiming debts of Dollars 1.5bn and losses of
Dollars 4bn, has awarded the mandate to sell its Ebro stake to Credit Suisse
First Boston and hopes to realise more than Dollars 340m from its disposal.
A spokesman for Mr de la Rosa said the Barcelona-based financier had
obtained a written agreement from Torras in April last year for a first
option on its stake in the food company.
Mr de la Rosa, who was the architect of the Ebro stake, severed his links
with the KIO in May last year when new management took over at the KIO's
London's headquarters and at Torras.
Torras said: 'de la Rosa's writ cannot be considered legal.' According to
Torras, Mr de la Rosa's right over the stake was agreed between him and Mr
Jorge Nunez, then Torras's managing director. The agreement came days before
both men severed links with the KIO, Torras claimed.
Last Friday, Torras initiated criminal proceedings against Mr de la Rosa and
six other former Torras and KIO executives, including Mr Nunez, alleging
that they had committed financial irregularities which had involved Torras
in losses of more than Dollars 860m.
Most of Torras's shareholding in Ebro is pledged to creditor banks as
collateral for outstanding loans.
The main creditors, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, Sumitomo and Spain's
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, will have to wait for three to four for Credit Suisse
to conduct due diligence of Torras's stake in Ebro.
The Torras equity is worth about Dollars 200m at market prices because
Ebro's share value has been penalised by Torras's difficulties as well as
the market depression. Independent analysts put the value of a controlling
stake in Ebro at close to twice that amount.
It is not clear whether the Spanish government will allow Ebro to be
acquired by a non-Spanish company. The company, the biggest food group in
Spain, controls 54 per cent of the domestic sugar market and is held to be
Europe's leading rice producer.

FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Italy keeps tougher watchdog on
a leash - The belated and controversial move to stricter financial
supervison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BY pushing privatisation harder than all its predecessors combined, Italy's
new government has raised the profile of Consob, the country's companies and
stock market watchdog, beyond all previous expectations.
Much of the privatisation programme, which received broad parliamentary
approval last month, involves the stock market. The government is keen to
promote popular capitalism by encouraging Italians to buy shares.
Even when disposals look set to take place via auctions or tenders, rather
than flotations, Consob has been forced to take a stand when the companies
on the block are quoted.
Based in Rome, the agency, chaired by Mr Enzo Berlanda, had its first taste
of battle late last year after suspending the shares of a number of
public-sector companies following conflicting reports about their fates.
More discreetly, it has investigated sharp price movements which have in
some cases taken place ahead of market-sensitive information on
privatisation.
Consob showed signs of having sharper teeth even before the arrival of the
government's ambitious privatisation drive. The change stemmed from new
legislation, which has belatedly brought Italian bourse rules closer in line
with tougher regulations in many other western markets and personal factors
at Consob.
Laws reforming share trading through the creation of the societa di
intermediazione mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new breed of securities dealing and
fund management hybrids, have been the main impetus behind the change.
Consob is responsible, with the Bank of Italy, for policing a much tougher
stock market rulebook than was previously applied. Strict disclosure
requirements for the Sims have created greater transparency, while the more
exacting capital adequacy standards now operating have eliminated some
marginal players from the business.
New laws banning insider trading and setting out rules for takeover bids
have further boosted Consob's role. It now looks more closely for erratic or
inexplicable price movements, which could result from the illegal use of
privileged information.
Last year's introduction of a highly complex takeover code, based on
individual trigger levels for when companies should be subject to a full bid
from potential raiders, further raised Consob's role and responsibilities.
Consob has also been boosted by the removal of barriers to the free movement
of capital within the European Community, which has increased the role of
regulators across the EC. Harmonisation of national regulations on financial
services means new Italian regulations have had to be shaped with Brussels
in mind.
Personalities have helped. The agency's more interventionist approach has
been influenced by an increase in its resources and the arrival of more
forceful and, some say, better informed staff.
None more so than Mr Berlanda, who took over the chairmanship in March from
his predecessor Mr Bruno Pazzi. A former politician and senator for 13 years
for the northern city of Bergamo, Mr Berlanda was deputy chairman, then
chairman, of the senate's finance committee.
It was there a number of the reforms, now laws being policed by Consob, were
drawn up. Mr Berlanda gained additional experience of the complex links
between financial markets through the committee's work on various banking
scandals, including the affairs of Mr Michele Sindona, the Mafia-linked
financier, and the unauthorised loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro.
For critics of Italian equities, the reforms have come not a day too soon.
Only slowly is the Milan bourse shaking off its reputation for
unreliability, poor transparency and even the occasional bankruptcy of a
financial intermediary.
However, Italy's belated move to tougher rules and stronger supervision has
brought considerable controversy. Nowhere is this more so than with the Sims
law, which has triggered a chorus of complaints from foreign financial
institutions, which claim it discriminates in favour of Italian competitors.
The objections, echoed in various European capitals, as well as Washington,
have brought Italy into conflict with the European Commission. In a clash
building up through 1992, the Commission's competition directorate, then
headed by Sir Leon Brittan, argued the Sims law contravened the Treaty of
Rome on free competition.
The Commission has issued a formal procedure against the Italians, who have
so far failed to amend the Sims law as required. It remains to be seen
whether the new Commissioner taking over from Sir Leon will push the dispute
up to the European Court of Justice, or whether the Italian government will
be prepared to show greater flexibility.
Insider trading rules and the new takeover code have also brought their
critics, although in both cases from within Italy, rather than abroad. Some
brokers argue the insider rules are too broad to be effective, yet are also
too legalistic, in preventing Consob from acting independently.
Even writing newspaper articles based on 'privileged' information could put
the author and source at risk. Yet Consob lacks the legal powers to
investigate suspected insider traders in its own right.
Once it is has adequate evidence, Consob must pass on its findings to local
magistrates. However, the snail's pace of Italian justice and the fact that
most prosecutors are probably unfamiliar with the intricacies of financial
markets makes the chances of convictions extremely slim, critics say.
Mr Berlanda admits the new takeover code is flawed. 'We've seen that those
countries which have the most complex takeover laws are in the biggest
difficulties, while those with the simplest rules tend to function best,' he
says. 'By setting individual trigger levels for what constitute controlling
stakes in Italian quoted companies, Consob has created a set of rules which
are so complex as to be almost incomprehensible,' agrees one analyst.
Meanwhile, plans to boost Consob further by improving its financial
resources are at an early stage. Hopes for more staff, particularly for its
Milan-based markets division, could be thwarted by government spending cuts.
However, new laws to boost popular share ownership, due to be approved by
the cabinet this week, could also contain measures to secure independent
funding for Consob.
Failing such action, many fear it still lacks the muscle adequately to
police its new powers.

ASKO DEUTSCHE Kaufhaus, the German retail group which is majority-owned by
the Swiss-based Metro group, is planning to hive off four of its operating
subsidiaries through partial stock market flotations, the company's chief
executive said yesterday.
Mr Klaus Wiegandt, speaking at the first press conference since Germany's
Federal Cartel Office gave approval to Metro to proceed with the Metro
purchase at the end of November, said the plan was to reduce the group's
debt by DM1.5bn (Dollars .920m) from its level of about DM4.5bn over the
course of the year.
This would be achieved through a mixture of outright sales, rationalisations
and partial flotations. The first subsidiary to be floated is to be the
Praktiker DIY business. Mr Wiegandt said that Morgan Grenfell, the merchant
bank subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, was working on a plan to float 25 per cent
of the company.
The other subsidiaries to be spun-off in this way are: Adler, which includes
the group's fashion and textile businesses; its Ungar and Roller furniture
chains grouped under a company called Mobel; and Deutsche SB-Kauf, which
will include the SB supermarket chain. The Massa supermarket chain, another
Asko subsidiary, is publicly-quoted.
Asko's parent company lost DM269m in 1991 after a profit of DM106m in 1990;
sales this year are expected to be in the region of DM20bn. The high debt
balances reflect a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s, culminating
with the purchase of Co-op in 1989. Analysts said the company would have to
sell off at least one large stake, possibly its holding in the AVA
supermarket chain.
The fusion of Asko with the privately-owned Metro will create one of the
world's largest retailers, with combined sales approaching DM70bn. Mr Erwin
Conradi, Metro's Dusseldorf-based chief executive, said that the acquisition
was motivated by the need to strengthen both companies' food-retailing
business. Mr Conradi said that the companies' combined turnover in this
sector would be DM23bn-DM24bn, making the group the sixth largest retailer
in this sector.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Geevor's future in balance as benefactor
fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEEVOR, the UK mining company with an 85-year history, has seen its main
hopes of survival collapse with AF Budge, the privately-owned civil
engineering group which was forced into re- ceivership by its banks last
month.
Budge provided Pounds 330,000 with no strings attached during the past year
to keep Geevor afloat.
The companies were working on a scheme to inject Budge's North American
gold, silver and coal mining assets into Geevor, which began as a Cornish
tin mining company.
Geevor was nearly killed off in 1991 when the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce withdrew banking facilities in controversial circum- stances.
Some Geevor shareholders took up Pounds 1.25m of loan notes shortly
afterwards, partly so the company could pursue the bank through the courts.
Geevor's Stock Exchange quotation was suspended in January last year and its
advisers, Smith New Court, still hope that another company will be
interested in it as 'a relatively clean shell'.
Mr Richard Osmond of SNC said yesterday two companies were showing interest.
'Geevor has some very supportive shareholders - they have put up money three
times in the past two years with very little to show for it - and it has
some tax losses to offer.'
He said it would be preferable if a company with mining-related interests
took over because many of Geevor's institutional shareholders held the
equity in mining funds.
Geevor disposed of its Cornish tin mine some time ago and it had been closed
down previously. Its present assets, gold interests in Costa Rica and the
Mainband colliery in the UK, are not being operated.
Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, the former chairman, said yesterday Geevor still
owed money to its advisers and auditors, but all trade creditors had been
paid.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: 'Good housekeeping' behind advance at Nobo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBO GROUP, the visual aids and office products supplier, announced a
tenfold increase in pre-tax profits in the half-year to October 31 in spite
of losses from its office furniture operation which has been sold.
Pre-tax profits came to Pounds 622,000; they compared with Pounds 62,000
which was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 227,000 as compensation
for a senior director who left the group.
Turnover increased marginally from Pounds 9.92m to Pounds 10.2m, but Mr
Roger Colvin, chief executive, said sales at Nobo's continuing operations
improved 6.5 per cent.
Mr Colvin said 'good housekeeping' and lower interest rates, which saw
interest charges fall to Pounds 281,000 (Pounds 369,000) were the key
factors behind the improved profitability.
Sales of its overhead projectors, white boards and notice boards were strong
in the first quarter.
In contrast, operating losses at Budgie, the furniture-making subsidiary
sold in October, rose from Pounds 137,000 to Pounds 371,000.
Earnings per share improved to 3.92p (0.06p). The directors have declared an
increase from 1p to 1.5p in the interim dividend.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ratners cautious on annual results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS, the heavily- indebted jewellery retailer, said yesterday that its
UK operating profits rose more than 20 per cent in December, despite a 27
per cent fall in sales in the month. Christmas 1991 had been a time of heavy
price cutting.
This was a more positive trading statement than had been expected and the
group's shares rose 1 1/4 p to 13p.
However, Ratners warned that the financial year to the end of this month
would show pre-tax losses at about the same level as last year's Pounds
24.4m, before exceptional charges, which were Pounds 98m last time. The loss
forecast disappointed analysts, who were expecting a lower figure.
Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, said the figures for December showed
the trading strategy of going for margins rather than volume was working. Mr
Gerald Ratner, the former chief executive who left suddenly in November, was
thought not to have agreed with this strategy.
Mr McAdam said the group's results were within limits agreed with its
bankers last summer, when they promised to maintain borrowing facilities
until June this year. He was confident that new arrangements could be
reached with bankers.
Mr McAdam said savings of Pounds 50m had been achieved in 1992-93 and stocks
had been cut by Pounds 60m. But he warned of a provision in the year's
figures for further rationalisation of about Pounds 20m.
The annual figures would show an operating profit in the US and a loss in
the UK, Ratners said. In the US sales in December fell 8 per cent. Group
sales in the 11 months to the end of December were down 18 per cent.
Mr McAdam said group debt would be about Pounds 250m at the year end at
constant exchange rates, but would rise when the dollar debt was translated
at actual exchange rates.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Finding security in an open market - The
export drive at Kenrick &amp; Jefferson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS penetrating the West Bromwich fortress which is the headquarters of
Kenrick &amp; Jefferson do not just sign a book to acknowledge their presence.
They sign a declaration of security and secrecy.
They will make no disclosure about customers' orders they might see being
processed, or, indeed, about the plant's technology or the general strategy
of the company.
If this seems at odds with the greater openness associated with the European
single market, it is simply because the kernel of the Kenrick business is
security print and systems.
Kenrick is pitting its skill against the counterfeiter, adding special inks,
holograms, magnetic stripes and so on to the special papers used in items
like building society pass books, passports and labelling packages for the
freight business.
The company is interested in any security printing, short of currency
production.
But the privately-owned company is also pitting its skill against European
competitors. Executives acknowledge that it has drawn some benefits from the
moves towards a single European market. Mr Stephen Adams, director of
Kenrick's security print and systems division, listed three.
There is a spin-off from the development of common standards, documentation
 -'the physical things in shipping goods' - is easier and the more open
trading procedures which 'allowed us to compete on a flatter playing field'.
The trading procedures which interest Kenrick are the tendering regulations
for public sector contracts. It was a public sector contract which took
Kenrick into the European market. It is public sector contracts which remain
crucial.
After Kenrick had supplied the British Post Office with a documentation
package for the start in 1986 of a new express mail service, it heard that
the French Post Office was interested in a similar product and won a
contract.
It then began to look for others and found them with the post offices of
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland. It went into
Tahiti and Gabon on the back of the French contract. It has expanded into
Argentina, Cyprus and Russia, but it has not yet managed to do business with
the Bundespost in Germany.
'We are competing mainly now on open tender,' said Mr Adams, but, he added
with a nod towards twisting the terms of tender to the company's advantage,
'if we can encourage a particular specification, we will.'
Security print and systems account for about Pounds 10m, or a third of
turnover and of that 40 per cent comes from direct and indirect exports.
Such exports go beyond labelling packages for express mail systems
including, for example, the printing of passports for east European
countries, citizens of which are adjusting to new travel freedom.
But maintaining a steady growth in the overseas market became more hazardous
immediately sterling left the exchange rate mechanism and devalued. Dealing
with a fluctuating currency, coming to terms with a new instability, is of
more immediate importance to the company than the moves to the European
single market.
'It is difficult to quote prices. We now have to look at each case
carefully,' said Mr Adams, noting that quotations were made in the currency
of the customer.
Kenrick has been forced to revert to the practice it adopted before sterling
joined the exchange rate mechanism. It is covering its currency exposure by
taking forward contracts on the foreign exchange markets. 'So we know at the
outset what we are going to get.'
The devaluation gave the company a competitive edge, but said Mr Adams,
'customers are saying they want some benefits of that devaluation.' They are
wanting price cuts giving them a slice of the extra margin Kenrick might
have obtained.
At the same time devaluation 'will make raw materials more expensive. It
hasn't done yet. But it will,' asserted Mr Adams.
He gave as an example the specialised papers the company uses, which might
be based on Portuguese pulp with a special coating provided in Italy or
Belgium. In addition the cost of plastics, which cover Kenrick labelling
packages, is linked to the price of oil, which, in turn, is quoted in
dollars.

FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Scrip issue move buoys Burndene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Burndene Investments yesterday leapt 110p in a thin market to 355p
after the Hull-based caravan and hosiery group accompanied a 34 per cent
preliminary profits increase with a sharply increased final dividend and an
imaginative scrip issue.
Mr David Caldow, chairman, said the scrip issue, on an uncommon 10-for-1
basis, would increase the issued share capital 'to a level which will more
appropriately reflect the increased scale of the group's activities'.
He said the company was concerned that its modest capital would fall foul of
moves late last year by Stock Exchange marketmakers to reduce the number of
stocks on their books.
'We looked at a 1-for-1, then a 2-for-1 and a 3-for-1 and thought 'Why not
make a fist of it?''
The increase at the pre-tax level for the 53 weeks to October 3 - from
Pounds 4.33m to a record Pounds 5.78m - was achieved on turnover ahead 21
per cent to Pounds 57.1m (Pounds 47.3m).
A final dividend of 10p is recommended, lifting the total for the year by 53
per cent to 13p and maintaining dividend cover at just over three times.
Despite an overall reduction in sales in the caravan holiday market, the
Willerby Caravan manufacturing side together with the small mobile park
operating division contributed an adjusted Pounds 3.64m to profits, up from
Pounds 2.98m last time, on turnover of Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 38.6m).
The Pretty Legs hosiery offshoot raised profits to Pounds 760,802 (Pounds
685,721) on turnover slightly higher at Pounds 8.57m.
A merchandising division is being developed to increase distribution of the
brand through retail outlets.
Order books at Willerby were 'a little higher' than the same period of the
previous year, Mr Caldow said, while sales at Pretty Legs were slightly
higher than the comparable first quarter.

FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hints of switching in BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUGE turnover in both classes of BT shares dwarfed the rest of the London
market yesterday and prompted renewed speculation over institutional
manoeuvring ahead of the expected sale of the remaining tranche of shares
held by the government. Broker Smith New Court conducted the business, which
saw three blocks of 9m shares and one of 4.5m in the partly-paid traded at
285 1/2 p. Turnover reached 35m as the stock added 2 at 285p.
In the fully-paid, 4 blocks of 9m traded at 399p, a large premium to the
then ruling market price, which closed 2 up at 390p after volume of 36m.
There were suggestions of switching from the partly to the fully-paid. The
government announced its intention to sell its remaining 21.8 per cent stake
 -1.34bn shares, dubbed BT3 by the City - two months ago. Speculation has
been made about a July sale date, which at yesterday's price would raise in
the region of Pounds 5bn for the government.
Guinness tumbles
The surprise announcement by Guinness of a Pounds 125m provision to fund
rationalisation sent its shares tumbling and reinforced nervousness
surrounding current trading, due to be detailed to analysts from tomorrow.
While the provision is to be made against the year ended December 1992,
analysts were preparing to reduce estimates for 1993 and predicted that the
shares would remain weak for the next 18 months. Yesterday they dropped 21
to 473p in turnover of 7.9m.
Further pressure came as news broke that Spanish beer sales fell 5 per cent
last year. That will increase the gloom surrounding Guinness's Spanish
subsidiary. In addition, LVMH, in which Guinness has a 24 per cent
crossholding, had its shares suspended yesterday on the Guinness
announcement and said 1992 sales would be 'slightly lower' than in the
previous year.
Reckitt tussle
A clash of views erupted in the market over health and household goods group
Reckitt &amp; Colman. Agency broker James Capel decided it was time to buy the
shares, while Smith New Court wanted little to do with them.
The Capel view was based on the stock's recovery potential. It said the
company's price-earnings ratio was at a 25-year historic relative low and
argued that Reckitt, which derives about 70 per cent of its profits from
overseas, will have currency-related gains in 1993 but will also see
underlying growth in 1993 and 1994.
Meanwhile, Smith New Court decided that there was more value to be found in
SmithKline Beecham. Pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Paul Woodhouse shaved his
1992 Reckitt profits forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 248m and advised
clients to switch their investments into SmithKline, which he feels offers
better growth potential.
Reckitt showed a healthy 12p gain at one stage but the tightly traded shares
were sold down later to close only 4 higher at 642p. SmithKline 'A' ended 6
ahead at 475p and the Units 4 up at 416p.
A trade press report that German group Knauf was expanding its first
plasterboard production plant in the UK hit shares in rival BPB Industries,
which supplies 90 per cent of British plaster. Details of the Knauf plan
remain sketchy and analysts downplayed the significance of the move. The
shares fell 13 to 187p.
The shares were also said to be suffering after a good run and fears that
the French economy will be slow to emerge from recession. BPB has
significant French interests. Also dragged down with BPB were RMC Group, off
6 at 557p, Redland, down 9 at 422p, and English China Clays, 18 adrift at
449p.
Rank Organisation's categorical refusal to consider any offer for its film
business disappointed some in the market and the shares retreated 10 to
701p.
A consortium had been put together to mount a bid, which some analysts
thought Rank might consider given its debt position. Although a deal looks
unlikely, leisure specialists said Rank may consider a Pounds 100m-plus
offer for its Odeon chain of cinemas.
Weakness in Thorn EMI was attributed to talk of poor UK music sales figures
for December, although analysts pointed out that the more important US
market had had a good Christmas trading period. Thorn is said to be due to
start briefing analysts next week on its overall trading position and rumour
has it that sales are slightly ahead of market expectations. The shares
retreated 11 to 840p.
Conglomerate Hanson was slightly firmer against the trend following meetings
with about 165 analysts in New York on Monday. Hanson observer Mr Jack L.
Kelly of Goldman Sachs said the company had moved from being 'cautiously
optimistic' to 'optimistic' on the potential in the US, where it generates
half of its earnings.
It had also signalled a commitment to returning to its core businesses, a
move expected to make the company more comprehensible to US investors. The
shares firmed 1 3/4 to 237 3/4 p.
ICI slid 11 to 1087p after falling on Wall Street.
Shell Transport eased 3 to 530p, with both NatWest Securities and Strauss
Turnbull issuing bearish notes.
Reports in an authoritative US trade journal that the State of California
planned to stop reimbursements for ulcer drugs gave an opportunity for heavy
selling of Glaxo shares. The stock opened higher on the back of heavy buying
on Monday but turned round to record a fall of 17 at 723p with unusually
heavy turnover of 11m shares.
UK analysts said the Californian decision was worth about Dollars 50m in
total and substantially less with regard to Glaxo's key drug Zantac.
Most specialists said worries that the West Coast move would start a
nationwide trend were groundless. However, they suggested that UK
institutions were looking for an excuse to sell the shares.
High Street bank Lloyds fell 12 to 506p on speculation that it might be
poised to take up the remaining stake in its Abbey Life subsidiary when it
announces results in early February. Profit-takers were also at work.
Hong Kong bank HSBC saw heavy turnover with investors switching from the
ordinary to the Hong Kong registered. The latter advanced 7 1/2 to 505p with
9.7m traded, while the ordinaries closed 4 up at 523p on volume of 12m. The
nature of the shares means that UK institutions are automatically under
weight and selling is easily mopped up.
A warning from Dalepak Foods that this year is likely to be worse than last
year sent the shares plunging 66 to 317p.
Asda shares edged forward 2 1/4 to 65 1/4 p in steady volume of 13m. Talk of
executive moves was again heard.
Tomkins added 4 at 249p in the wake of a recommendation from NatWest
Securities.
British Airways declined 6 to 268p on US selling. Lehman Brothers became the
latest house to reduce current year estimates, shaving Pounds 50m off its
previous forecast to reach a new figure of Pounds 240m. However, Mr Chris
Will, European airlines analyst at Lehman, said: 'It is time to buy BA
again.'
The Pounds 14.2m disposal of its water and waste treatment helped Simon
Engineering to bounce 11 to 121p.
Swiss Bank Corporation was a big seller of British Aerospace amid
suggestions of problems with the proposed deal between Taiwan Aerospace and
BAe on its regional aircraft division. The shares relinquished 9 to 176p,
with selling of the stock in the traded options also a feature.
Shares in Rolls-Royce gave up 6 to 108p, with Henderson Crosthwaite said to
have downgraded profits expectations. Vosper Thornycroft was wanted and
among a handful of stocks that bucked the market trend, climbing 8 to 457p
to set an all-time high.
Strong bid speculation returned to Lucas Industries. The shares moved
forward 6 to 144p, with suggestions of an offer in the near future at around
175p.
Radio station GWR advanced 12 to 310p after a 12.6 per cent placing of the
company's shares at 310p apiece.
Property development group Shaftesbury was one of the few property stocks to
gain ground, finishing 6 stronger at 45p after recent news that Lloyds
Investment Managers had increased its stake in the company from 17 per cent
to 21 per cent.

FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES ABOUT the poor economic outlook led to a dull day in both stock
index futures and traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
Early firmness for the March FT-SE future contract, which opened at 2,797,
faded and the contract fell to 2,784 at around 10.30am as profit-taking
became the order.
March regained momentum to trade uneventfully for the next few hours, before
traders caused another sell-off at around 2.30pm as they focused on the
weakness in the gilts market due to the imminent auction and a lack of
strong support from Wall Street.
Sellers continued to emerge for the rest of the session, sending the
contract further into retreat and pulling the underlying cash market lower.
March fell to the session's low of 2,770 just ahead of the close.
Light bargain hunting helped the contract recover a little to finish at
2,774, down 21 from Monday's close and some 2 points above its estimated
fair value premium to cash of around 14. Turnover fell to 6,542 lots.
Volumes were also down in the traded options. The day's total of 26,739 was
well below Monday's 34,506 lots. Some 10,929 contracts were dealt in the
FT-SE 100 option, although the Euro FT-SE 100 option only saw 311 lots
transacted.
J. Sainsbury was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,211 lots traded,
followed by Grand Metropolitan with 1,106 contracts.

FT  13 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie frets over funding pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no let-up in the downward pressure on London's equity market,
which moved significantly lower for the sixth consecutive trading session,
still fretting over the massive PSBR funding programme needed this year, the
prospect of big cash calls from companies and niggling worries about the UK
Budget.
Sentiment was given an additional blow very late in the session by reports
that the Bundesbank had indicated that there was little scope for any early
cuts in German interest rates. International markets had been expecting an
early move by the Bundesbank to lower its Lombard and discount rates after
the recent reduction in its Repo rates.
The market was further shaken by news in the mid-afternoon of a substantial
restructuring of Guinness's distilling interests which will lead to a charge
of Pounds 125m in this year's figures.
The day's economic news, detailing input and output prices for December, was
said to have been in line with market expectations and failed to produce any
substantial reaction in either the equity or foreign exchange markets.
Dealers marked share prices higher at the outset of trading, reflecting the
modest improvement on Wall Street overnight and hopes that five successive
days of selling in UK equities could have left the market oversold. The
first couple of hours of trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index edge higher to
record a rise of around five points, with much of that coming from the
pharmaceuticals sector.
Here, Glaxo, with a significant weighting in the Footsie, made good early
progress, as did SmithKline Beecham, another of the market's heavyweight
stocks. Both were lifted by renewed heavy buying from domestic and overseas
sources, although Glaxo later turned off sharply to end lower on balance
amid worries about its Zantac anti-ulcer drug.
There was little real impetus in the market upturn, however. Strong selling
of the March Footsie future developed, upsetting the cash market.
Thereafter, support for the market virtually evaporated and the FT-SE 100
gradually gave ground to touch the day's low point of 2,757.4, some 16
points off, before closing a net 15.5 down at 2,757.9. Over the past six
trading days the index has fallen 103.6, or 3.6 per cent.
The Footsie Mid 250 index was riddled with big losers and continued its
recent steep decline, settling a further 10.7 lower at 2,879.2 for a
three-day decline of 61.1, or 2.1 per cent.
Turnover yesterday was a healthy 666.4m shares, continuing the strong run
since the turn of the year. The 666.4m included exceptionally heavy activity
totalling around 70m shares in the two classes of BT stock. Towards the end
of the session some 36m of the fully-paid and 35m of the partly-paid changed
hands amid hints of switching.
Figures released by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of market
turnover continued above the crucial Pounds 1bn level on Monday, when
business worth Pounds 1.29bn was transacted.
Some marketmakers continued to take the view that the market has now
overreacted on the downside to worries about gilts funding, rights issues,
the turbulent international situation and nervousness about the Budget.
Others, however, maintain that the market was overbought on the prospect of
big takeover bids.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp Dow fall amid Gulf
fears is recouped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
LATE BUYING helped US share prices recover from large losses yesterday at
the end of a volatile session, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.89 on balance at
3,264.64. Having spent all morning no more than 5 points above or below
Monday's close, the Dow plunged more than 20 points in mid-afternoon before
retrieving all of its loss in the final 30 minutes of trading.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion,
ending a net 0.09 firmer at 431.04, while the American SE composite finished
0.83 off at 396.41 and the Nasdaq composite down 2.95 at 679.45. Volume on
the New York SE amounted to a heavy 239.4m shares.
News that Iraqis had entered Kuwait for the third time increased tension in
the Middle East. It also made investors even more cautious about buying
stocks ahead of what might turn out to be a resumption of hostilities in the
Gulf.
Uncertainty about the direction of domestic economic policy also contributed
to the market's lack of direction. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury
secretary designate, appeared before Congressional hearings yesterday but
provided few specific details on the likely policies of the Clinton
administration.
Among individual stocks, Chrysler dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 34 5/8 in
volume of 2.8m shares as investors reacted to the news released late on
Monday that the financially stretched car manufacturer plans to bolster its
balance sheet by raising nearly Dollars 1.5bn through an international
offering of shares.
Elsewhere in the auto sector, Ford eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 and
General Motors held firm at Dollars 34 1/4 , largely untroubled by a report
from brokerage house SG Warburg which said Ford has been gaining market
share at GM's expense.
IBM continued to regain some of the ground lost over recent weeks. After
hitting a low last week of Dollars 45 7/8 , the stock has since risen
steadily. Yesterday it added Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 3/4 in busy trading.
The first batch of 1992 fourth-quarter earnings reports trickled in
yesterday, with Paramount softening Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 in spite
of news of a 22 per cent jump in the entertainment group's final quarter net
income to Dollars 110.2m.
Investors appeared equally unimpressed with record earnings from the Federal
National Mortgage Association, which reported an 18 per cent rise in
October-to-December profits to Dollars 426.4m, but saw its share price edge
Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 77 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Rexon weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 8 and Marcam
plunged Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 21 1/4 after the two companies issued
profits warnings.
Canada
TORONTO ended marginally firmer, lifted by a recovery in Canada's heavily
weighted gold shares and strength in the utilities sector due to a jump in
the shares of BCE Inc. Some of the smaller oil and gas issues also found
favour.
The TSE 300 index gained 4.4 at 3,314.5 but declines held an edge over
advances by 312 to 298 after volume of 49.2m shares valued at CDollars 357m.
BCE jumped after Bear Stearns initiated coverage on the company with a buy
recommendation. Strength in BCE, up CDollars 1 3/8 at CDollars 42 1/4 on
749,058 shares, boosted Northern Telecom, which is 52.6 per cent owned by
BCE. Nortel gained CDollars 1 1/4 at CDollars 53 1/4 .

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv pauses after an outstanding
year in 1992 - More modest gains lie ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a breathtaking year in 1992, investors on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
(TASE) may have to settle for more modest gains in 1993. But there is still
some confidence in the market that the graph will continue to point upwards
this year.
A potent combination of strong economic growth, rising corporate
profitability, low interest rates, falling inflation, liberalisation and
optimism over the Middle East peace talks made the TASE an outstanding
performer in 1992, outstripping markets in North America, Europe and the Far
East.
The general index climbed more than 74 per cent on the year, while the
narrower index of the 94 most-traded stocks was up in excess of 95 per cent.
Volume rocketed to Shk37bn (Dollars 14.8bn) for the year, compared to
Shk19bn in 1991, and for the first time, equity market capitalisation of
Shk77bn at the year-end was greater than that of the government securities
market, which has traditionally dominated the TASE.
All this came on top of a strongly rising trend in the previous 18 months,
broken only by a dip during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91.
Mr Saul Bronfeld, managing director of the TASE, attributes this remarkable
bull run to confidence that the economy, fuelled by mass immigration from
the former Soviet Union, is in a period of real growth not seen since the
early 1970s: real GNP growth for 1992 was 6.4 per cent.
Confidence was enhanced, perhaps prematurely, by a spreading belief in the
market, following the election of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led government
in mid-year, that the Middle East peace talks, begun in late 1991, would
ultimately yield the political stability that the economy has always lacked.
In addition, liberalisation in the capital markets, including a relaxation
of foreign exchange controls and a rise in the proportion of funds that
providential funds can invest in equities, has fuelled demand in what
remains a tightly held market, in spite of a flood of new issues over the
past 18 months.
In November and December, issues worth a total of more than Shk1bn by IBD
Holding, a big investment group, and First International Bank of Israel were
oversubscribed respectively 120 and 400 times. The first foreign-based funds
for investing in Israeli securities were set up last year.
To soak up this demand, the market is clamouring for the government to
fulfil its promise to accelerate privatisation of the state's big industrial
holding companies such as Israel Chemicals, Bezeq, the telecoms monopoly,
the electricity utility and El Al, the national airline.
'We feel the market can absorb a lot of new issues. If things continue as
they have in 1992 there is certainly big scope for privatisation issues,'
says Mr Bronfeld.
Some 25 per cent of Bezeq and Israel Chemicals have been sold off on the
TASE and the government plans to float a 20 per cent stake in each of the
country's two biggest banks, Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim, in February,
raising up to Shk2bn. Mr Bronfeld says that the pace should be stepped up in
case an opportunity to sell off the companies - and deepen the market - is
missed.
But as 1992 ended, some of the excitement had tempered. Economic growth may
slow this year and the outlook for the peace talks has been clouded by the
crisis over the deportation in December of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon.
So far in January, the market has been steady and some analysts believe that
with an average price-earnings ratio of around 20 times, a period of
consolidation is now desirable.
Mr Mark Meiras, managing director of Pacific Mediterranean Investments,
which provides independent market analysis, foresees a solid, but calmer,
year. 'I think the market can maintain something like 25 per cent growth.
That is slow compared to the last 2 1/2 years; but in my opinion this market
needs to take a breather,' he says.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris weakens on poor LVMH
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continent was mixed yesterday as tension in the Gulf generally kept
activity subdued, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was disappointed by the unscheduled 1992 earnings report from LVMH,
which was prompted by a bearish statement from Guinness, the UK drinks group
with which LVMH has a cross-shareholding. The CAC-40 index fell 21.05 to
1,793.53 in steady turnover of FFr2.1bn.
Shares in LVMH and its affiliated companies, Christian Dior, Au Bon Marche,
Agache and Arnault et Associes were suspended pending the statement. They
are due to be re-quoted today.
LVMH later said that 1992 net group profit would fall 20 per cent to FFr3bn
from FFr3.74bn the previous year, due in part to the restructuring costs at
Guinness. The UK company disclosed that it would take a Pounds 125m
exceptional charge in its 1992 accounts to fund a three-year
re-organisation.
TF1, the television station, rose FFr18.60 to FFr405.50 amid reports of a
change in its programming structure which should lead to lower costs.
FRANKFURT continued to play a waiting game, moving Volkswagen and and
Siemens ahead of meetings today and tomorrow as the DAX index ended 1.77
lower at 1,530.19. Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM4.2bn.
VW recovered another DM6.40 to DM262.90 ahead of today's extraordinary board
meeting, on a report that it plans to cut 30,000 jobs by the end of 1994.
Siemens, which led the market down late last week, rose DM5.10 to DM577.80.
Analysts expect the electronics group to report a slight fall in
first-quarter profits at its annual news conference tomorrow.
Commerzbank ended DM1.90 lower at DM241.10 and, after the close, announced a
one-for-11 rights issue at DM200 a share.
AMSTERDAM advanced on selective buying, with the CBS Tendency index rising
0.4 to 96.4. Nedlloyd, which saw a day's high of Fl 29.40 as buyers returned
after Monday's 10 per cent fall, closed 20 cents ahead at Fl 27.60.
Publishers showed activity with Elsevier up 80 cents at Fl 123.90 and VNU
rising Fl 1.10 to Fl 92.60 on recent positive brokers' forecasts.
MILAN staged a late recovery from earlier lows thanks to gains in Generali
and Credito Italiano, and the Comit index rose 1.9 to 451.11 in turnover
estimated at not more than Monday's L196bn. The launch of the Republic of
Italy's DM5bn Eurobond also boosted sentiment.
Generali rose L5 to settle at L30,000 lire but then gained a further L800
after hours. Credito Italiano rose L142 or 4.8 per cent to L3,117 on a
newspaper report that its privatisation was well under way. The
state-controlled food group Sme, another privatisation candidate, rose L63
to L5,883.
ZURICH recovered from Monday's decline, the SMI index closing 29.8 higher at
2,079.3. Lower interest rates lifted financials, UBS bearers rising SFr15 to
SFr875.
Adia bearers rose SFr19 to SFr220 and certificates by SFr3 to SFr27.50 on
rumours that the temporary employment group planned to swap its certificates
into bearer stock.
MADRID featured a 5.5 per cent gain in Ebro, up Pta75 to Pta1,425, on news
earlier in the week that Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment division of
the KIO, is putting its 36 per cent stake up for sale. The general index
lost 0.26 to 219.11. BRUSSELS saw continued interest in Delhaize which fell
BFr12 to BFr1,266 on profit-taking after recent strong gains. The Bel-20
index closed 1.90 higher at 1,146.01 in turnover of BFr933m.
STOCKHOLM closed lower in a continued reaction to the presentation of the
government's budget proposal for the fiscal year 1993/94 on Monday. The
downgrading of six Swedish banks and financial institutions by Moody's, the
US credit rating agency, also weighed on sentiment, with the banking sector
slipping 3.1 per cent. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 7.9 to 935.2 in
turnover of SKr708m.
HELSINKI closed lower for a third straight session as government plans to
lower the nominal value of bank shares in compensation for state support
sent the sector's shares lower. The bank and finance index fell a further
6.7 per cent while the HEX index lost 10.0 to 878.20.
OSLO was encouraged by rises in Norsk Hydro and Hafslund as the all-share
index gained 6.14 or 1.6 per cent to 392.0 in turnover of NKr185m.
Hafslund's B-shares advanced NKr7 to NKr159 on news that the US Food and
Drug Administration had granted approval for the marketing there of Omniscan
which is used in magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Norsk Hydro gained
NKr2.5 to NKr165.5.
VIENNA fell back after data showed unemployment at its highest level in 39
years. The ATX index lost 5.12 to 716.23 with OMV falling Sch7 to Sch587.

FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises slightly as
HK holds on to gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARKET indices gave a mixed picture of the mood in Tokyo yesterday. The
Nikkei average climbed a little after a week of consecutive falls, but the
more broadly based Topix index eased slightly, writes Bethan Hutton in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 91.50 up at 16,681.05, opening at a low for the day of
16,585.53 and reaching a high of 16,734.02 before receding later in the
session.
Volume continued to be very low, estimated at 150m shares, the same as the
previous day. Declining stocks marginally outnumbered gainers by 441 to 421,
with 212 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares ended
1.95 off at 1,281.98, having remained in a narrow range all day. In London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.35 to 1,039.97.
Mr Chris Newton, at James Capel, described the Nikkei's moderate rally as
unconvincing and largely technically based. 'We saw virtual paralysis today.
Only a certain amount of investment trust buying was going on,' he said.
There was also some buying by small public pension funds.
Victor Co of Japan (JVC) climbed Y50 to Y890 in volume of 1.7m shares after
Matsushita Electric Industrial said it would adopt JVC's new W-VHS standard
for its own high-definition television video recorders. The rest of the
sector continued to weaken, with the exception of Pioneer Electronic, which
gained Y20 at Y2,580. Matsushita shed Y10 to Y1,100, Sony Y50 to Y4,110 and
TDK Y10 to Y3,490.
The likelihood of lower profits estimates pushed Tokyo Steel down Y160 to
Y2,610. Nippon Housing Loan was traded actively, putting on Y6 at Y295,
after a newspaper report suggested that the company's restructuring
programme would be more extensive.
Gold-related shares continued to do well out of uncertainty in the Middle
East, and the expectation that gold commemorative coins will be minted to
mark the wedding of the Crown Prince later this year. Sumitomo Metal Mining
appreciated Y9 to Y658 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting Y14 to Y471.
Shiseido, the cosmetics sector leader, lost Y30 to close at Y1,330 in active
trading related to the issue of a warrant bond. Odakyu Electric Railway was
the most heavily traded stock, ending Y1 firmer at Y662 after volume of
3.69m shares.
In Osaka the OSE index rose 11.45 to 18,321.18 in high volume of 97m shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday. Bombay remained closed
as riots in the city continued.
HONG KONG held on to Monday's gains, created by renewed interest from
overseas institutions. The Hang Seng index finished just 1.84 down at
5,671.26 in turnover of HKDollars 2.45bn.
Hongkong Telecom was unchanged at HKDollars 9.70, HSBC 50 cents lower at
HKDollars 58.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 55.
SINGAPORE ended little changed but the underlying tone softened as sellers
started to emerge. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,545.02, up
1.06, in volume of 67.2m shares.
SIA Foreign was ahead 5 cents at SDollars 9.10, ex a one-for-one scrip
issue.
SEOUL lost ground for the second day in a technical correction. The
composite index closed 5.37 lower at 703.05 in turnover of Won653.95bn,
against Won836.66bn.
NEW ZEALAND recovered most of what it lost on Monday, the NZSE-40 index
ending 20.76 higher at 1,520.71.
The market had been worried about prospects following base rate increases by
the ANZ and BNZ banks last week, but several banks have declined to follow
this lead and sentiment has improved.
BANGKOK reported rallies in four major banks and two big property companies,
and the SET index climbed a further 6.9 to 933.6 in turnover of Bt8.21bn.
The index has risen by 5.2 per cent in the past six trading days and, over
the past two days, some traders said that banks were looking overbought.
TAIWAN rose on a technical rebound and on hopes of a cut in the stock
transaction tax. The weighted index closed 46.31 ahead at 3,217.55 but
turnover contracted to TDollars 6.4bn from TDollars 8.3bn.
KUALA LUMPUR finished lower on further selling as talk of lower than
expected economic growth in the last quarter of 1992 continued to affect
sentiment. The composite index fell 5.0 to 616.5 in volume of 63.2m shares.
JAKARTA reported active trading at the close after initial lethargy, but
prices ended mixed and the official index eased 0.45 to 278.07.

HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer group, is to invest Fl 30m (Dollars 16.5m)
in building production lines for laser printers at its European distribution
centre in Amersfoort, in the Netherlands.
When completed in March, the expanded facility will have two production
lines with a combined capacity of 80,000 printers per month. The site, which
is set to double in size to 20,000 square metres, may eventually house up to
five production lines, depending on demand.
HP has two other European printer production plants in Spain and Italy.
The printers assembled in the Netherlands are destined for customers and
resellers in Europe, where the market for laser printing is less mature than
in the US, opening up prospects of healthy growth in demand, HP said.
The Amersfoort production site will create up to 200 jobs over the next few
years.
The production lines will be operated by a subsidiary of Van Ommeren, the
Dutch shipping and storage group, which also runs HP's distribution centre.

The Dutch investment is part of HP's attempts to reduce the time it takes to

distribution in one location, the company also aims to cut costs and enhance
flexibility, enabling it to produce tailor-made printers for customers
requiring specific configurations.
The Amersfoort production site will create up to 200 jobs over the next few

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carclo advances 28% as order book improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering Group, the Leeds-based card clothing, wire and
engineering products group, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in
profits and earnings and stronger order intake in the past three months.
Interim pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 3.68m in the six
months to end-September on sales up 5 per cent at Pounds 40.7m.
Earnings per share jumped from 4.9p to 6.3p and the interim dividend is
increased by 5 per cent to 1.8p.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the group was expanding its wire division and
was moving the card clothing operation.
The group finished the period with Pounds 3m of net cash, a position which
is likely to prevail at the end of the year.
The core card clothing division - which grew from the traditional family-run
wool-carding industry in Yorkshire in the last century - increased profits
by 46 per cent. On sales of Pounds 9.8m boosted by an acquisition in
Belgium, operating profits rose to Pounds 1.5m. Part of the increase
followed a greater level of sales to OEM manufacturers which bought very
little in the same period in 1991.
Mr Ewart said this relatively inexpensive product had a high gross margin;
any increases in sales fed quickly through to the bottom line.
Profitability in the wire division jumped by 78 per cent to Pounds 800,000
from a low base. In particular Joseph Sykes Brothers, which makes
nylon-covered wire for products like the bindings of notebooks and
paper-clips, remained a strongly growing market.
Carclo has decided not to sell Bruntons, a maker of wire rope products,
having failed to negotiate a satisfactory price. This company lost Pounds
300,000, a Pounds 100,000 improvement over the previous period.
The general engineering division enjoyed a 27 per cent increase in profits
to Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 11.5m. The division benefited from sales
of cable controls to companies such as Ford and Vauxhall and from strength
in bronze and aluminium components, but the remainder of the division faced
difficult trading conditions.

Singer &amp; Friedlander, the investment banking firm, is setting up a capital
markets subsidiary to be headed by Timothy Lyons and Jonathan Stolerman.
Lyons and Stolerman both worked at Prudential-Bache, where they set up a
'special transactions group' in 1988-89, working on international arbitrage
deals. In 1990, the duo moved to Sec Pac Hoare Govett, and in August 1992
they set up their own business called Marlborough Corporate Finance.
Lyons and Stolerman will initially work with two other associates, in
addition to their support staff. Singer &amp; Friedlander Capital Markets aims
to specialise in structured finance, including debt securitisation.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Swiss acquire 11.9% holding in HunterPrint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWISS Company has taken an 11.9 per cent stake in HunterPrint through
the specialist printer's refinancing exercise.
The share price rose 7p yesterday, closing at 50p - the same level as
the placing price in December's Pounds 18.3m rescue issue.
Ferag, which has supplied binding machinery to HunterPrint's Corby
factory, becomes the largest shareholder with 6.9m shares. Its interest
in the UK group, which lost Pounds 12.2m pre-tax last year, is described
as friendly.
Ferag is one of several new shareholders to emerge following the rescue
issue, HunterPrint's second in two years. The first involved Sir Ian
MacGregor, who was ousted as chairman in August. The take-up of
December's issue by established investors was only 22 per cent. (*)
The proceeds were mainly devoted to reducing lease obligations on
printing machinery at the Corby factory. The lessors, who took part in
the ordinary share placing, also received Pounds 5.2m of new convertible
preference shares.
Through the placing, three leasing companies have gained stakes of
between 3 and 4 per cent. They are Summit Leasing, W &amp; G Equipment
Leasing and Norwich Union Equipment Finance. The total number of shares
held by these and three other leasing companies is 7.7m, or 13.3 per
cent.
In the refinancing Barclays agreed a new credit facility of Pounds
14.9m.
(* A further 31.1m shares were taken up under the terms of a placing,
12.3m of them by established shareholders who therefore in total took
52.9 per cent of the new shares. A further 27.8 per cent were taken up
by new investors and 19.3 per cent by lessors.)

FT  12 JAN 93 / Technology: Cheaper HDTV in view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two products aimed at breaking through consumer resistance to
high-definition television for home use were unveiled by Victor Co of Japan
(JVC) last week. The company plans to launch a low-priced HDTV set and
HDTV-compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by
autumn this year.
Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies,
and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far
translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the
prohibitively high cost of models already on the market.
The cheapest HDTV set so far on sale in Japan is a Y1.3m (Pounds 6,800)
model from Sony. Other versions, labelled 'Hi-Vision', are half-way houses
between HDTV and conventional TV, using simplified decoders which produce
picture quality better than ordinary TVs but not up to full HDTV standards.
JVC says production costs for its new HDTV will be much lower because of the
development of a smaller, simpler but fully-functional decoder requiring
fewer integrated circuits. The new sets will go on sale in Japan later this
year, priced at less than Y1m, the level at which industry analysts have
predicted that sales for home use will take off. However, supplies will
reach the shops too late to take advantage of the boom in HDTV sales
predicted in the run up to the wedding of the Japanese crown prince this
summer.
The HDTV video recorder is also to be sold cheaply enough to break into the
mass market, at around Y600,000. Using technology known as W-VHS, the
machine splits HDTV signals to record them on double-track metal tape. The
company stresses that in addition to making high-quality HDTV recordings, it
can also play back existing VHS format recordings, and can record two
conventional TV programmes simultaneously on the double-track tape.
JVC claims the videos will also be compatible with the next generation of
HDTV broadcasting systems being planned around the world, not just with the
current Japanese Muse format.

FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Inchcape loses family ties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The retirement of Lord Tanlaw, 58, as a non-executive director of Inchcape,
means that the direct ties between the company and the family of James Lyle
Mackay, the first Lord Inchcape, have been almost completely severed.
Lord Tanlaw, the current Lord Inchcape's half-brother, joined the family
firm the year after its shares were quoted on the London stock market. After
six years in Calcutta and the Indian subcontinent, Simon Tanlaw was
appointed a director in 1966.
He became a non-executive director in 1971 after he was elevated to the
peerage. During his time at Inchcape he was involved in the group's merger
with the Borneo Company, which took it into vehicle distribution (now
Inchcape's biggest business) and also the creation of the Gray Dawes Bank.
Lord Tanlaw has decided to retire in order to devote more time to the
development of Fandstan Electric - his own group of railway engineering
companies. The current Lord Inchcape, 75, who headed the company between
1958 and 1982, remains life president but no longer has a seat on the board.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE within the IRA for an end to violence is growing, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
Leaders of the republican terrorist organisation knew no British government,
either Labour or Conservative, would talk to those who resort to violence,
Sir Patrick said.
He added: 'There is no way out. I believe the Provisional IRA's leaders
increasingly realise this, and many of them wisely want to stop.'
Sir Patrick's comments, which voiced publicly what the Northern Ireland
Office has long sought to argue in private, followed a speech before
Christmas setting out the benefits that would arise if terrorists in the
province renounced violence.
He wants to portray himself as a neutral referee between aspirations of
Unionist and nationalists aspirations while keeping pressure on terrorists.
Sir Patrick said fresh political talks on the province's future would
re-start once the new Irish government was in place. The last initiative
collapsed in November.
Speaking at the Belfast Rotary Club, Sir Patrick said that security forces
had to strike a balance. Those calling for even tighter security, had to
consider, whether, 'they are content to see all normal, commercial life
strangled, to say nothing of the implicit but unjustifiable condemnation of
the entire Catholic community.'
But he said the IRA faced, 'further fruitless years . . they feel driven by
their dead and by those 'behind the wire'. I must tell them that unless they
abandon violence there will be more dead, more lives spent behind the wire,
and another blighted generation.'

Cook Travel, the Massachusetts-based travel business that used to be
wholly-owned by Mr Maxwell.
The buyer of the company - which last year had Dollars 1.7bn of turnover -
is Mr David Paresky, the chairman who since 1989 has owned 50 per cent of
Thomas Cook Travel. Mr Paresky and his wife now own 100 per cent of the

Mr Maxwell bought Thomas Cook Travel in 1988, and a year later agreed to
link the business with Crimson Travel, Mr Paresky's company, with the pooled
operation trading under the Thomas Cook name.
Thomas Cook Travel, the third-largest US travel agency chain, employs 3,000

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Electric to pull out
of mainframe computer production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday confirmed
that it was planning to withdraw from mainframe computer production and
concentrate on smaller machines amid a continuing downturn in the domestic
computer industry.
A further sign of the severe conditions facing Japanese electronics
companies came with an announcement by Moody's Investors Service, the US
rating agency, that it has placed the long and short-term ratings of NEC
under review for possible downgrading.
Meanwhile, the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers said
yesterday industrial machinery orders fell 39.4 per cent in November,
compared to a year earlier, while consumer electronics sales over the first
10 months of 1992 were down 17 per cent.
Each of the announcements confirms the industry's fear that an expected
recovery will not come until late this year. Moody's said the review of NEC
follows 'concern that profitability, liquidity, and free cash flow may be
impaired over a longer period than previously expected due to severe
competition in its core businesses'.
Over the next few weeks, Japanese electronics manufacturers and other
leading industrial companies will review profit forecasts for the full-year
to March, as many had counted on an early upturn in domestic demand.
Mitsubishi reported a 73 per cent fall in first-half profits, NEC 71 per
cent, and Matsushita Electric Industrial 51 per cent.
However, demand is continuing to weaken. Production value of the mainframe
computers was down 21 per cent over the first 10 months of last year,
prompting Mitsubishi Electric to stop the development of new products,
leaving Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi the remaining Japanese makers.
'It would cost us more than Y100bn to maintain our mainframe development. We
didn't feel that we had gained sufficient market share to risk continuing in
that market,' Mitsubishi said yesterday.
The company is concentrating on computer systems between a workstation and
personal computer in size, trying to keep a distance from the heavy
discounting in the Japanese personal computer market. But Mitsubishi said
'our sector is difficult too'.
Mitsubishi's decision to streamline its product mix is typical of other
consumer and computer electronics makers.
Video camera sales fell 30 per cent in the first 10 months last year,
financial terminals 18 per cent, integrated circuit testers 38 per cent and
telecommunications equipment 7.5 per cent.

MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese consumer products group, is to set up a
Pounds 12m factory in Livingston, West Lothian, to make air conditioners.
The 95,000 sq ft plant will employ 200 people.
It will open early next year, bringing to 1,700 the number of people
Mitsubishi Electric employs in Scotland. The Japanese company makes video
recorders at Livingston and televisions at Haddington, East Lothian. Its
Apricot Computers subsidiary manufactures personal computers at Glenrothes,
Fife.
Mitsubishi Electric's other European plants are in Dublin and Croydon,
Surrey.
The plant will manufacture air conditioners for the European market. As
Britain is not a strong market for air conditioners the Scottish inward
investment body, Locate in Scotland, regards Mitsubishi Electric's decision
to choose Scotland as a coup.
Sir Peter Parker, chairman of Mitsubishi Electric UK, said Scotland had been
chosen 'because we feel at home here'.

Mr Paddy Galvin, chairman and chief executive of Waterford Crystal, said
yesterday that he has been 'terribly encouraged that we have had an almost
unanimous acceptance by the workforce'.
Last November, the unions at the company's three plants in Ireland rejected
the rescue package, which initially called for 500 voluntary redundancies
out of the workforce of 1,900, across-the-board wage cuts and an industrial
peace agreement for five years.
The proposals then went to the Labour Court for arbitration, which
recommended that the voluntary redundancy scheme should go ahead, as well as
a series of wage cuts as high as 25 per cent for some workforce categories,
but that the industrial peace agreement be reduced to three years and that a
12-month moratorium be placed upon any further outsourcing of crystalware
from European manufacturers.
Mr Galvin warned last week that a rejection by the workforce of the Labour
Court recommendations would result in the closure of Waterford's Irish
plants, and that all of its crystalware sold under the Waterford brand name
would in future be sourced overseas.
In the past six years the crystal division has suffered losses in the region
of IPounds 90m, due to rising costs and declining markets, exacerbated by
the recession in its two principal markets in the US and UK.
Rationalisation has resulted in 1,400 redundancies since 1987, while
short-time working over the past 18 months has further enabled losses to be
trimmed.
However, in the company's interim results in September, it appeared that a
16 per cent increase in crystal sales failed to lift the division out of the
red.
It reported increased losses of IPounds 3.2m for the half year.
The company blamed the deficit on 'unabsorbed overheads' related to
increased short-time working.
The rescue plan is expected to facilitate a return to full-time working in
the coming months.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Six Swedish banks downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG-TERM debt ratings of six Swedish banks were downgraded yesterday by
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, while two others were
upgraded.
Moody's said the downgrades reflected a view that the banks are likely to
emerge solvent, though not financially robust, after measures agreed in
December to shore up the Swedich banking system. The package was not the
equivalent of a permanent guarantee, though it provides protection for
creditors over the medium-term, Moody's said.
The senior debt ratings of two banks - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and
Nordbanken - were reduced by two notches, from AA3 to A2, while Svenska
Handelsbanken was reduced one notch to A1.
SBAB was also cut from AA1 to AA3, Spintab from AA2 to AA3 and Swedbank from
A to A2.
However, the short-term obligations of both Gota Bank and Industrikredit to
Prime-1 from Prime-2, reflecting the fact that the December package reduced
the uncertainty concerning these two banks after their serious financial
deterioration.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Watchdog's assessment of coal costs attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL CLARKE, chairman of British Coal, yesterday took public issue with
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, accusing him of
misleading the public over the cost of generating electricity from coal.
In an unusual step Mr Clarke publicised a letter he sent to Prof Littlechild
highlighting what he described as 'serious shortcomings' in a report on
electricity prices last month. By using 'a very selective and dubious
example' Prof Littlechild had created the mistaken impression that coal was
an expensive way of generating electricity.
In his report Prof Littlechild examined electricity pricing to determine
whether the regional electricity companies were purchasing power
economically. He concluded that they were, but in the process indicated that
coal-based electricity contracts were the most expensive, followed by
nuclear power and gas.
Although Prof Littlechild's report was only a prelude to a full study to be
published at the end of this month it caused a furore because it coincided
with the coal review being conducted by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary.
In his letter yesterday Mr Clarke said that Prof Littlechild failed to
compare like with like and used 'arbitrary' assumptions about the role of
various fuels in meeting electricity demand. He also complained that Prof
Littlechild stressed the positive features of gas without examining those of
coal, and that he portrayed coal as permanently high-cost in spite of steady
improvements in British Coal's productivity.
Mr Clarke said examination of Prof Littlechild's findings showed that coal
was competitive with other fuel sources, including coal imports, and offered
advantages. He stressed doubts expressed by Prof Littlechild about whether
electricity generators were passing the full benefits of lower coal prices
to their customers.
Mr Clarke said the press seized on a key sentence in the press release on
the report which said coal contracts were the most expensive. 'I fear that
the misconception about the fundamental economics of generation from coal
and gas, created by misreporting of your study, has served to confuse rather
than inform those making vital decisions in the coal review (who will not in
general read the detailed document).'
A spokesman for Prof Littlechild said officials would discuss the points
raised in the letter with British Coal and they would be taken into account
in the final report.
British Coal's operations should be licensed to the private sector rather
than be privatised, according to Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal
commercial director. He said yesterday mines would be publicly owned 'but
the private sector would be able to show whether it could do better'. Work
started yesterday on 23 workshops and offices, costing Pounds 850,000 and
funded by British Coal, at Seaham Grange industrial estate in the East
Durham coalfield. The area is to lose its last two pits under the latest
closure plans.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Squeezing Suez down to size: The streamlining of the French
holding company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the cerebral ranks of the French financial elite, Mr Gerard Worms,
chairman of Suez, one of France's largest financial and industrial holding
companies, is noted for his cheerful temperament and unflappable air.
Mr Worms has, over the past few months, needed every ounce of cheerfulness
as Suez has been hit by crisis after crisis. Its banking, insurance and
property interests have been badly affected by France's economic slowdown.
It has had to spend FFr2.4bn (Pounds 279m) to recapitalise Indosuez and La
Henin, its banking subsidiaries. Suez has also clashed with Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), one of its largest shareholders.
The outlook for 1993 looks little better. Mr Worms faces a bracing 12 months
in which he must get to grips with Suez' operational problems and make the
peace with UAP, while trying to complete the long-term restructuring of the
group.
'This is the first time in our history that every area of the business has
hit the bottom of the cycle,' said Mr Worms. 'The worst is probably behind
us, but 1993 will still be tough.'
The economic squeeze came just as Suez was absorbing the motley assortment
of industrial interests it acquired in the bruising battle for Societe
Generale de Belgique. The integration of La Generale has been unexpectedly
difficult, not least because Suez was a classic French holding company with
stakes in dozens of different companies.
Mr Worms' main objective since becoming chairman in 1990 has been to
streamline the group by selling peripheral interests. By last autumn Suez
had made FFr11bn of disposals, FFr5.5bn of which came from SGB. In theory it
should now be nearing the end of its restructuring. Instead Suez is
struggling to adjust to the depressed state of its investment banking and
insurance interests and to the crisis in the Paris property market where
average rentals have fallen 20 per cent over the past three years.
Suez has already announced a steep fall in 1992 interim net income from
FFr1.8bn to FFr500m. Indosuez and La Henin have had to be recapitalised
after making hefty property provisions. Indosuez last week raised around
FFr400m from the sale and leaseback of its Paris headquarters. However
Paribas, the French bank, still predicts a fall in net profits from FFr3.8bn
in 1991 to FFr1.4bn in 1992.
Mr Worms expects to reduce the level of provisions this year, but does not
anticipate any improvement in the property market. However he does hope for
a modest recovery in insurance, and possibly investment banking, in the
second half.
In the meantime the cost cutting and disposals will continue. Suez has
already made FFr1.5bn of disposals since last autumn and Mr Worms plans to
raise another FFr3.5bn over the next 12 months. By the end of 1993 he hopes
to have finished the restructuring. 'We will be less like a conglomerate of
independent companies, I want to see more co-operation,' he said. 'Suez must
operate as a group.'
Paribas expects Suez' profits to settle at FFr2bn in 1993 before
strengthening in 1994. 'The restructuring has been very complicated,' said
Mr Pierre Flabbee, an analyst with Paribas in Paris. 'But the management is
sound. They have been very honest about their problems and have the right
strategy for the future.'
However Suez still has to resolve the row with UAP. The two groups fell out
late last year when Suez broke off negotiations to sell control of Colonia,
a German insurer, to UAP. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP chairman and one of Mr
Worms' predecessors at Suez, had refused to pay the extra FFr1.5bn that Suez
wanted for the controlling stake.
So far Suez has held a winning hand. UAP has made no secret of its eagerness
to control Colonia, but Suez has no real need to sell. The affair has also
helped Mr Worms to show he can stand up to his old boss.
Mr Peyrelevade is now putting pressure on Suez. UAP recently invested in
Nordstern, the most profitable part of Colonia. It could now step up the
pressure through its stake in Suez itself, 6.3 per cent of the shares and 10
per cent of the votes.
Mr Worms is unflappable. 'There is no real problem with UAP,' he said. 'Jean
Peyrelevade and I understand each other' he said. 'The only difference
between us is price - and isn't that always the case in business?'

SIEMENS, the German electronics group, is to meet with Skoda Pilzen of the
Czech republic today to talk about possible co-operation in the transport
business, Reuter reports from Erlangen.
A Siemens spokesman said the talks between Mr Lubomir Soudek, the Skoda
chairman, and Mr Wolfram Martinsen, a Siemens management board member in
charge of the transport business, were initiated by Skoda.
Earlier talks between the groups about joint ventures in power generation
and transport have run into difficulties about the terms.
Siemens has said it was fundamentally interested in co-operating with Skoda,
but the joint ventures had become financially unfeasible due to the demands
from Skoda.
The spokesman said the two groups would focus on the possible co-operation
in the transport sector today and talks on energy co-operation would be a
secondary issue.

BFG BANK should make a profit this year, according to Mr Michel Renault,
managing director of France's Credit Lyonnais, Reuter reports from Paris.
The French state-owned bank took a stake of 50 per cent plus one share in
the troubled German bank at the end of last year for a cash and equity
injection totalling DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m).
'The new team has . . . put in place measures over two years, which should
allow BfG to return to profitable business from this year,' Mr Renault said.
BfG made a group operating profit, adjusted for extraordinary items, of
DM144m in 1991 after a loss in 1990.
*****
A CONSORTIUM of four creditor banks and the state-owned Ferunion Foreign
Trade Co has acquired Salgglas Rt, the troubled Hungarian glassmaker, Reuter
reports from Budapest.
Ms Eva Botlik, managing director of Inter Europa Bank, said the consortium,
called Glasunion Kft, planned for Salgglas to supply windshields to the
Suzuki factory in Hungary and was seeking markets in Ukraine, according to a
local news agency.
Salgglas, which declared bankruptcy in May 1992, made a 270m forint (Dollars
3.2m) loss in 1991 on sales of 2bn forint. It has not yet reported 1992
results.
*****
COCKERILL SAMBRE, the Belgian steelmaker, will continue its investment
programme to modernise key facilities despite poor earnings, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
Mr Jean Gandois, the chairman, met union representatives yesterday and told
them the main investments in 1993 will be carried out. These include
modernising one blast furnace. Another furnace was due to be modernised in
1994. The company said said last week that it was likely to show a 1993 loss
in its steel business.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P sees improved quality of US
credit in certain areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, one of the largest Wall Street credit rating agencies,
yesterday maintained that the slump in credit quality in the US had reached
its nadir, and was now improving in certain areas.
But it suggested that a declining trend was still underway outside the US,
and that credit standings of non-US corporations could worsen further this
year.
Mr Leo O'Neill, S&amp;P's chairman, attributed the improving US picture to four
factors:
the improving economy;
the restructuring of corporate balance sheets, which produced record levels
of debt and equity issuance last year;
better capital ratios and improving asset quality in the banking sectors;
and on the municipal front, efforts by state and local governmental
organisations to balance their budgets.
The improved US situation is relative, however. S&amp;P revealed that, in 1992,
it still made 492 downgrades, representing Dollars 383bn of debt, compared
with 252 upgrades, representing Dollars 126bn worth.
But the margin between down and upgrades narrowed significantly. In 1991,
for example, there were 695 downgrades overall, covering Dollars 504bn of
debt - and for US industrial corporations, upgrades and downgrades were
roughly similar in number last year. S&amp;P said there were 189 downgrades
representing Dollars 141bn of debt, compared with 150 upgrades, covering
Dollars 66bn-worth.
Looking ahead, Mr O'Neill suggested that S&amp;P saw continued pressure on
credit ratings in some sectors of the US economy, notably retailing,
airlines, computers, publishing, and the property-casualty insurance sector
where the costs of Hurricane Andrew are still taking a toll.
But he also forecast improvements for the banking, telecommunications,
environmental waste, supermarket, and electric utilities sectors.
Outside the US, S&amp;P painted a bleaker picture.
Mr O'Neill forecast a further year of rating downgrades for Europe
generally, including the banking and corporate sectors.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Swiss acquire 11.9% holding in HunterPrint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWISS Company has taken an 11.9 per cent stake in HunterPrint through the
specialist printer's refinancing exercise.
The share price rose 7p yesterday, closing at 50p - the same level as the
placing price in December's Pounds 18.3m rescue issue.
Ferag, which has supplied binding machinery to HunterPrint's Corby factory,
becomes the largest shareholder with 6.9m shares. Its interest in the UK
group, which lost Pounds 12.2m pre-tax last year, is described as friendly.
Ferag is one of several new shareholders to emerge following the rescue
issue, HunterPrint's second in two years. The first involved Sir Ian
MacGregor, who was ousted as chairman in August. The take-up of December's
issue by established investors was only 22 per cent.
The proceeds were mainly devoted to reducing lease obligations on printing
machinery at the Corby factory. The lessors, who took part in the ordinary
share placing, also received Pounds 5.2m of new convertible preference
shares.
Through the placing, three leasing companies have gained stakes of between 3
and 4 per cent. They are Summit Leasing, W &amp; G Equipment Leasing and Norwich
Union Equipment Finance. The total number of shares held by these and three
other leasing companies is 7.7m, or 13.3 per cent.
In the refinancing Barclays agreed a new credit facility of Pounds 14.9m.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB and Nickelodeon in channel joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting and Nickelodeon, the children's channel owned by
Viacom, the US media group, yesterday announced a joint venture to produce a
children's television channel for the UK.
The channel, which will include original British programmes for children, is
the first example of BSkyB's policy of extending the range of channels on
offer through joint ventures.
The new channel, managed as an independent business, will be launched in
October. This is the first move into the UK by Nickelodeon, which claims to
be the largest producer of children's programmes in the world. In the US the
Nickelodeon cable channel is available in 58m homes.
Ms Anne Sweeney, senior vice-president of Nickelodeon's Program Enterprises,
said yesterday one of its main goals was to create a worldwide network for
children combining US programmes with programmes produced with local
partners.
The UK Nickelodeon channel will be part of BSkyB's planned 'basic tier' of
channels. These are free but will later be included in a subscription
package costing about Pounds 4 a month.
An agreement in principle has already been reached between BSkyB, in which
Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a 16 per cent stake, and TCI,
the US cable group, to add three channels to the basic package. They are
Bravo, the classic film channel, The Children's Channel and Discovery, the
factual and documentary channel.
The Nickelodeon deal makes it more likely that MTV, the pop music channel
that is also owned by Viacom, can be enticed into the subscription package.
By the autumn, BSkyB could be entirely a subscription service so that only
those who pay for a special card will be able to view. BSkyB hopes to keep
the cost of all the channels below Pounds 20 a month.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Certified accountants' audits rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER THAN half of the certified accountants registered to conduct audits of
British companies performed satisfactorily, their regulatory body's first
annual report said yesterday.
Of the 297 firms and sole practitioners visited by the Chartered Association
of Certified Accountants 139 were judged to have poorly developed quality
controls or to have produced work which failed to support the opinions they
gave.
A further 23 firms - 8 per cent - were considered potentially in breach of
audit regulations or professional conduct rules to an extent sufficient to
justify immediate action.
Only 134 firms - 45 per cent - were found to be satisfactory, with only
minor deficiencies identified.
The figures are contained in the first annual report submitted by the
association to the Department of Trade and Industry since a new system of
self-regulation of auditors was introduced in October 1991.
The association found that many firms did not have systems in place that
allowed their audit work to be assessed by regulators. Most firms were in
the course of updating their auditing methods and documentation as a result
of the new regulatory regime.
One of the most common problems was that many auditors kept too much work in
their heads, rather than recording it so it could be assessed by independent
inspectors.
Mr Anthony Booth, under-secretary of the association, said regulation had
brought a 'dramatic improvement in standards of auditing' by the end of the
first year.
He said that problems identified early in the first year of monitoring had
been declining and that any disciplinary cases had been dealt with 'firmly
and swiftly'.
The report shows that one fifth of practices visited need to be revisited
within two years to ensure that any deficiencies were corrected.
The association received 350 complaints during the year, including 245
concerning practising members. Most referred to disputes over fees, and
there was found to be no case to answer for almost half the total. But eight
complaints have ended in disciplinary action, including one against a member
who went into partnership with a convicted fraudster, one declared bankrupt
and one who had been disqualified as a company director.
Two individuals were expelled, four firms had their auditing certificates
withdrawn and five agreed to stop audit work while a further 59 will be
revisited within two years.
The association represents 39,000 members around the world, and 3,412
separate practising units have registered to conduct audits in the UK. The
association plans to visit all registrants within five years.
The report shows that the cost of audit regulation to the association was
Pounds 362,500 last year against about Pounds 115,000 in the previous 12
months in development costs.

JAPAN'S prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, arrived in Jakarta yesterday on
the first leg of a south-east Asian tour and was immediately urged to open
up his country's economy, Reuter reports.
An editorial in the Jakarta Post yesterday called for stronger Japanese
assurances backed by action to remove tarriff barriers.
President Suharto was expected to raise the issue of high tariffs on
Indonesian plywood, one of the country's biggest exports, in formal talks
with Mr Miyazawa today.
Tokyo officials said Mr Miyazawa would stress the importance of a continuing
US military presence in the region in his talks in Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Brunei. This would be the thrust of a keynote speech he would
make in Bangkok on Saturday, they said. Sanyo Electric of Japan yesterday
announced a Dollars 27m (Pounds 17.7m) joint venture to manufacture
refrigerator compressors in Indonesia, Robert Thomson writes from Tokyo.
Sanyo will provide 90 per cent of the capital for PT Sanyo Compressor
Indonesia, to be based in West Java. The remaining 10 per cent will be held
by two local private investors.
'We will establish this company in response to growing worldwide demand for
small-sized reciprocating compressors,' Sanyo said. 'Indonesia is a large
market, and the labour resources are excellent so we decided to build the
new factory here.'
Production is expected to begin in June next year, with initial annual
production of 400,000 units, rising to 1.2m over five years. The new company
will eventually have about 440 employees.
Sanyo already has compressor plants in Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan, and
three subsidiaries in Indonesia manufacture televisions, batteries, and
electronic components.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Austrian right in row over foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jorg Haider, leader of Austria's right-wing Freedom party (FPO), has
launched a controversial anti-foreigner initiative with a harsh attack on
the country's political establishment.
In a weekend speech in Graz, capital of the province of Styria, Mr Haider
attacked the broad coalition of politicians, church leaders, journalists,
intellectuals and artists formed in recent weeks to thwart his drive for an
anti-foreigner petition.
Austrian voters will be able to sign the petition, which calls for stricter
immigration laws and other measures directed against foreigners, in the week
beginning January 23.
Mr Haider is counting on as many as 1m signatures, about a fifth of
Austria's electorate. But all the other main political parties, as well as
the Austrian president, Mr Thomas Klestil, have appealed to the voters to
ignore the petition, which they say is designed to incite hatred against
immigrants.
A broad anti-Haider platform, 'SOS Neighbour', has attracted wide support
and is planning a demonstration against xenophobia to coincide with the
start of Mr Haider's petition-signing week.
The strongest opposition to the right-wing initiative has come from the
Roman Catholic church. On Sunday, leaflets calling for tolerance and ethnic
harmony were distributed to church-goers across Austria.
The petition's success is seen as a test of Mr Haider's appeal. Less than
500,000 signatures would be a big setback.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Irish coalition prepares for a short honeymoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE coalition government which takes office in Ireland today can hope to
enjoy only the briefest of honeymoon periods.
The first Fianna Fail-Labour party coalition in the history of the state, it
has set itself the immediate task of reversing the upward trend in
unemployment figures, which indicate that almost one in five of the
workforce are now without a job.
How it sets about that task, with interest rates at record high levels, the
punt coming under daily pressure in the foreign exchange markets, and one of
the toughest budgets in years having to be prepared over coming weeks, is
likely to lead to some thorough soul-searching within both parties and tough
negotiations at the cabinet table.
When the cabinet is announced later today, the government purse strings are
expected to remain in the hands of Mr Bertie Ahern, the current finance
minister. His commitment to the budgetary discipline laid out in the
Maastricht treaty, necessary to keep Ireland in the fast track to monetary
union within the EC, is being supported by the Labour party, as is his
commitment to a 'no-devaluation' policy and to keeping the punt within the
narrow band of the ERM.
This implies an exchequer borrowing requirement capped in the region of 3
per cent of GDP, and the government debt/GDP ratio being reduced gradually
to 60 per cent by 1999, from its present level of 94 per cent.
The question of agreeing on ministerial spending targets within the broader
budget framework, however, has still to be resolved.
The joint programme of government, painstakingly negotiated over the past
six weeks, contains commitments to create 30,000 jobs a year, to take the
low-paid out of the tax net, to maintain social welfare spending at current
levels, to initiate a new public housing programme and to make new
investments in health, education and public transport.
The programme also aims to put new government equity into the state airline,
Aer Lingus, and to provide subsidies to mortgage holders and employers who
are suffering from high interest rates.
But the tentative figures pencilled in during the recent negotiations may
have to be drastically revised, if one of the consequences of continuing to
hold the line against devaluation is that commercial interest rates undergo
a sharp rise this week.
Banks and building societies have recently been sounding warnings that they
can no longer cushion retail customers from the present wholesale money
market rates.
One-week funds are at present incurring interest rates in the region of 100
per cent.
The most likely response of the new government would be to put in place a
series of temporary interest rate subsidies. At the same time it may mount a
diplomatic offensive around the EC to secure a commitment by the stronger EC
central banks to sustain the punt at its present parity within the ERM.
Encouragement has been drawn from the strengthening of the dollar and
sterling in recent weeks, and the Bundesbank's reduction of its repurchase
rate last week, which is being viewed as an indication that German interest
rates as a whole might start coming down in the weeks ahead, thereby easing
pressure in the ERM as a whole.
If that scenario does not come about, however, Ireland's first Fianna
Fail-Labour coalition is going to face some very tough and politically
unpopular decisions.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Genentech expects fall in
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE president of Genentech, the California-based biotechnology company that
was taken over in 1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday said the
company expected to report more than Dollars 18m of net profits for 1992.
The forecast, while sharply down on the Dollars 44.3m of net earnings
recorded in 1991, is in line with industry estimates.
Revenues were expected to rise above Dollars 540m for 1992, compared to
Dollars 515.9m in 1991, according to Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief
executive of the company. Mr Raab said 1993 revenues could reach Dollars
560m.
The company's last reported earnings - for the third quarter of 1992 -
showed a 43 per cent drop in net income to Dollars 7.7m. Revenues in the
third quarter were 2 per cent improved at Dollars 137.3m.
Genentech's net profits for the first nine months of 1992 amounted to
Dollars 14.6m, down from Dollars 44.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues
for the first nine months were Dollars 402.3m, up from Dollars 396.4m.
Mr Raab attributed the expected 1992 earnings decline to flat sales of
Activase, the heart disease drug, and a steep rise in spending on research
and development. Among the most expensive research projects are the clinical
trials of Activase and a related product for the treatment of cystic
fibrosis.
On Wall Street, Genentech's stock price closed Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars
38 3/4 .

FT  12 JAN 93 / Sharif worried over relations with India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday expressed concern
about deteriorating relations with India following an upsurge in
Hindu-Moslem violence prompted by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque.
'This tension is not good for either country,' he said in an interview with
the Financial Times.
India has cut Pakistan's consular staff to retaliate for a similar reduction
in India's diplomatic presence in Karachi, in the latest row between the two
long-term rivals.
Mr Sharif was speaking in the wake of a sharp upsurge in violence in
Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling against Moslem
insurgents, and in Bombay, where Moslems and Hindus are fighting in
incidents provoked by the sacking of the mosque in Ayodhya, northern India,
by militant Hindus.
Mr Sharif denied Indian charges that Pakistan was helping Moslem Kashmiri
insurgents with money, arms and training. He also dismissed a warning from
the US that, if Pakistan persisted with such aid, it risked being branded as
a terrorist nation and put on a blacklist consisting of Cuba, North Korea,
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Mr Sharif said Islamabad was explaining to
Washington that Pakistan was not involved in Kashmir.
The prime minister said Pakistan's help was limited to moral and diplomatic
support. He added that Pakistan was also concerned about 'the sufferings of
India's Moslems' following the Ayodhya incident but there would be no
interference in India's internal affairs.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has appointed a liberal to head the
former Soviet television network and an official from the Gasprom gas
monopoly as the government's chief of staff.
The chief of staff is considered more powerful than any minister, including
the numerous deputy prime ministers remaining in office from the previous
government of Mr Yegor Gaidar.
The former Gasprom official, Mr Vladimir Kvasov, replaces Mr Alexei
Golovkov, a technocrat who took over the job a year ago.
The appointment of Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, the head of the Russian
parliament's media committee, to run the Ostankino television network,
following Mr Yeltsin's summary sacking of its previous director, is intended
to reassure liberal opinion in the country.
The appointments are part of a reshuffle in which Mr Yeltsin is trying to
balance forces favourable to himself following his confrontation with the
conservative Russian parliament and his reluctant appointment of Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
But Mr Yeltsin's transfer of his allies in parliament to senior government
posts means that he now has very few senior friends left in parliament
itself, which is under the control of his most dangerous political rival, Mr
Ruslan Khasbulatov.

FT  12 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy selling hits second-line stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market retreated for the fifth successive trading session,
dragged down by some exceptionally heavy selling of the Footsie future and a
growing list of bearish economic and political factors at home and abroad.
The only glimmer of light during a gloomy trading session came with a better
than expected opening by Wall Street, which enabled London to edge up from
the day's lowest levels.
Nevertheless, the FT-SE 100 Index suffered another substantial setback,
closing 25.8 off at 2,773.4, while second-line stocks, represented by the
Footsie Mid 250, ran into a welter of selling which drove the latter down
about 43 points.
The market opened on a tentative note, with marketmakers looking for signs
of a technical rally after the previous week's sell-off. Little buying
developed, however, and share prices began to wilt in the face of steady
selling.
Pressure came from the gilt-edged market, which reeled from talk that today
might bring details of a Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction. Also, dealers were
increasingly aware of persistent market stories of a growing list of rights
issues in the pipeline.
The heat on the market was turned up a notch in mid-morning when a big
seller of the Footsie future, rumoured to have been on behalf of an overseas
fund, appeared in the derivatives market. The big player was thought to have
sold upwards of 3,000 contracts, triggering waves of index arbitraging, or
buying of the future and selling of stocks in the cash market.
The FT-SE 100, up 2.2 at its best, some 30 minutes after the opening,
subsequently reversed to trade at the day's lowest point, 2,761.5, or 37.7
points down, just before the opening of Wall Street. The latter kicked off
level and gradually edged higher, injecting a much-needed note of confidence
into the London market, which responded by rallying almost eights points by
the close of trading.
There was less confidence in second-tier stocks, where the Footsie Mid 250,
which has outperformed the FT-SE 100 since its inception last October, ended
a net 42.8 off at 2,889.9, having been down around 45 points at worst.
Consumer lending figures for November were viewed as slightly disappointing
and bearish for a retailing sector still feeling the effects of poor
quarterly sales figures announced last week by Boots. Yesterday saw a bear
raid launched against retailer Alexon and poor performances from some of the
UK's leading store groups, such as GUS, WH Smith and Dixons, the last-named
due to release interim figures this morning.
Composite insurers were targeted as likely candidates to raise money via
rights issues. Commercial Union was heavily sold, as was General Accident.
There was consolation for market operators in the continuing high levels of
turnover in UK equities. Last week saw daily turnover comfortably above the
Pounds 1bn level all week, reaching Pounds 1.49bn on Friday. Volume
yesterday picked up strongly after a rather sluggish start, eventually
reaching 592.7m shares.
Some strategists still view the equity market as overvalued, pointing to a
historically high price/earnings ratio of around 17. Senior marketmakers,
however, continue to see the recent retreat by equities as a healthy
correction.

FT  12 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call worries hurt CU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurer Commercial Union fell 16 to 618p on turnover of 2.8m
shares amid renewed speculation that the company might be considering a
rights issue.
Analysts said a cash call by Commercial Union was possible given its aim for
growth in new business, the general pressure on margins and the recent rise
in its share price to an all-time high of 644p. In 1992, CU announced Pounds
100m preference share placings.
Both Kleinwort Benson and Credit Lyonnais Laing were reinforcing their view
that the stock was overvalued. Kleinwort's insurance analyst said the shares
were at an 8 per cent premium to net asset value at the start of trading
yesterday, and he also cited weekend press comment on the possibility of
impending rights issues.
Elsewhere in the sector, General Accident lost 16 at 558p and Sun Alliance
fell 7 to 351p. Royal Insurance, which is particularly in need of extra
cash, was 8 lower at 283p.
HSBC supported
A strong overnight performance by Hong Kong's Hang Seng index prompted HSBC
Holdings to buck the dreary trend in London and the shares received further
support from a recommendation by Robert Fleming Securities.
Fleming published a buy note arguing that the bank will produce profits of
Pounds 1.6bn in 1992 and Pounds 2.2bn in 1993. It also announced a Pounds
131.8m warrant issue. HSBC ordinaries were 10 higher at one stage and closed
3 up at 519p. The Hong Kong registered added 1 1/2 at 497 1/2 p and combined
turnover was 11m shares.
Institutions have taken additional heart from comments on Friday by Chinese
leaders on the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's plans for political reform.
Cable and Wireless, which is also heavily influenced by market activity in
Hong Kong, gained a penny at 708p. However, Standard Chartered, one of the
Footsie's best performers in recent months, shed 9 to 581p on profit-taking.
Alexon raided
Further evidence of the fragile state of the consumer recovery was shown
with a bear raid on Alexon ahead of an expected cautious trading statement
this week. Shares in the clothes retailer dived sharply as the market
opened, losing around 20 per cent of their value before steadying. They
closed at 82p, a fall of 17 on the day. The drop was at first blamed on a
downgrade by Morgan Stanley, but the broker later denied this.
If the bears are to be believed, Alexon will join a growing list of
retailers to report flat pre-Christmas sales - taking the shine from earlier
talk that the much-heralded consumer recovery was gathering pace. Analysts
said they expected Alexon to reveal no improvement at its Dash chain, where
sales had been under pressure, resulting in downgrades last quarter.
Nervousness over the strength of the retail revival also undermined the
stores sector. Ratners, due to announce the level of its Christmas sales
shortly, ran into the bearish sentiment and the shares slipped 1 1/2 to 11
3/4 p on turnover of 18m. So too did Body Shop, off 10 at 164p.
The hangover from last week's trading statement from Boots, in which the
retailer revealed poor sales at its Do It All subsidiary, continued.
Analysts reported that the DIY group's owners - Boots and WH Smith - were
hinting that losses this year could reach Pounds 30m, double most market
estimates. This comes on top of reports that the two groups will need to
invest a further Pounds 15m into Do It All to fund a new distribution
centre. Boots fell 10 to 500p and WH Smith 'A' 13 to 456p.
A number of brokers advised profit-taking in Dixons, whose shares have
surged in post-Christmas trading on reports of strong computer games sales
and buoyant US electronics demand. However, neither of these factors
satisfied BZW, which said Dixons' US subsidiary Silo is still in
difficulties and the effect of sterling devaluation has still to be felt.
Nomura was also negative, arguing that the shares had run too far. Yesterday
they fell 12 to 262p.
Conglomerate Hanson held steady among weak internationally traded stocks on
reports that it had swapped its US gold mining operations for the coal
business of railroads and minerals group Santa Fe Pacific.
If it proceeds, the swap would make Hanson the world's second largest
privately held coal producer, while placing Santa Fe among the top 10 US
gold producers. The stock also received some support ahead of a presentation
to analysts in New York yesterday. Hanson shares eased 1 1/2 to 236p.
Profit forecast upgrades for BAT Industries by Hoare Govett failed to
counter the impact of a weaker dollar and the shares fell 12 to 968p. Hoare
has raised its figure for the year to March 10 by Pounds 60m to Pounds
1.63bn and that for the following year by Pounds 35m to Pounds 2.175bn. The
house is basing its reassessment on a better than expected output from the
tobacco side and a faster turnround for Eagle Star.
Among other dollar stocks, Reuters Holdings receded 14 to 1388p in spite of
announcing the launch of a new real time service for global money and
capital markets.
Shell lost 10 to 533p after a good run as investors switched into Royal
Dutch.
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham stood out firmly in a weak market as investors
took advantage of last week's price decline among big pharmaceutical
companies. A 1 per cent rise in Merck in New York also helped the shares.
Salomon Brothers was heavily on the bid again. Glaxo rose 8 to 740p and
SmithKline a penny to 469p in the 'A's and 3 to 412p in the Units.
Wellcome was 9 lower at 925p, however, following weekend press reports of
patent issues surrounding its two leading drugs. AAH retreated 18 to 597p
after a recent run. Broker Hoare Govett, although still a buyer of the
shares, shaved its forecasts.
The decision by Associated British Foods not to proceed with the purchase of
a US sugar processing group disappointed some in the market and the shares
fell 8 to 505p. Strong second line stocks from last week met profit-taking.
Among these, Booker fell 12 to 415p, Unigate 10 to 320p and Hillsdown, which
is hosting a series of institutional meetings this week, 10 to 134p.
Iceland Frozen Foods slipped 13 1/2 to 651p. Kleinwort Benson was said to
have moved from a buy to a hold position.
Rights issue talk again stalked Stakis and the hotel and casino group lost 3
to 41p.
Profit-taking hit the engineering sector, which has outperformed the market
by around 15 per cent over the past month. Siebe gave up 21 at 430p, further
affected by vague talk of a rights issue, while IMI dipped 12 to 266p.
Vickers 8 to 114p, Simon Engineering 9 to 110p and Meggitt 5 to 92p.
Reports of a US investigation into a subsidiary hurt TI Group and the shares
weakened 10 to 298p. However, Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais Laing said:
'Given that the contract under investigation is only worth Pounds 1m, I
think the fall has been overdone.'
Smiths Industries eased 4 to 376p, with BZW shifting its recommendation from
buy to hold. However, the house stressed it was a long-term supporter of the
stock.
Although Tomkins reported a 7.6 per cent improvement in interim figures to
Pounds 47.1m, the meeting with analysts disappointed and the shares fell 11
to 246p in trade of 3.6m.
Trafalgar House softened 2 to 87p after the chairman told the annual meeting
he foresaw no upturn in 1993.
Profit-taking and switching sent BICC down 8 to 334p. Dealers reported
switching into Delta, steady at 435p.
A downgrading in Rugby took the shine off the building materials sector. The
shares retreated 15 to 219p and pulled down Blue Circle 9 to 196p in their
wake.
USM-quoted aromatic oils company Treatt advanced 10 to 118p on healthy
annual profits.
Chemicals group Laporte rallied 4 to 587p following its bid for Evode, a
penny firmer at 120p, as a buy note from Williams de Broe landed on clients'
desks.

FT  12 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION about a large gilts auction, along with poli-tical and economic
worries, led to strong selling in the derivatives and heavy turnover, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The March futures contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,822, and after a brief
few minutes of buying at the beginning of the session, it fell on selling by
independent traders. A sell order for around 3,000 contracts executed by a
leading independent firm, together with further mid-morning selling by a US
house as talk on the gilts auction surfaced, led to more weakness in March.
It reached the session's low of 2,780 just before the opening of Wall
Street.
The firm start in New York helped the March contract briefly regain some of
the earlier loss before another bout of selling led to a further retreat.
March finished at 2,795, down 28 from Friday's close and around 8 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 14. Turnover was
heavy, reaching 12,210 contracts.
In traded options, an active session in the index options led to total
volume of 34,506 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 15,322 lots,
against Friday's figure of 8,073, while 4,509 contracts were transacted in
the Euro FT-SE option. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total
of 2,257 lots, followed by British Steel with 2,140 contracts dealt. Shell
Transport had 705 lots traded.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up despite further
tension in Gulf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices posted modest gains across the board yesterday as investors
traded cautiously against a backdrop of increased tension in the Middle
East, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.08 at 3,262.75, its
high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended
firmer, up 1.90 at 430.95, while the Amex composite finished 1.40 higher at
397.24. Secondary stocks outperformed the rest of the market, with the
Nasdaq composite climbing 5.19 to 682.40. Trading volume on the New York SE
was 218m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,097 to 707.
News that Iraqi officials had called for an 'honourable holy war' against
the UN allies, and that Iraqi troops had crossed the border into Kuwait for
the second time in a day set the tone for an uneasy opening to trading
yesterday.
Investors have been unsettled by the tension in the Gulf because they fear
that a renewal of hostilities between the US and its allies, and Iraq could
shatter the fragile confidence consumers have regained since the
presidential election and cast a cloud over the first few days and weeks of
the Clinton presidency.
Bargain buying in the wake of the Dow's 1.1 per cent decline last week, and
a continued influx of new investor funds into equities, however, ensured
that stock prices rebounded from an early decline, and stayed in positive
territory for the rest of the session.
Among individual stocks, IBM rallied from the previous week's losses, rising
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 in volume of 2.7m shares. Other big
technology stocks were also firmer, with Motorola up Dollars 3 1/4 at
Dollars 112 3/4 , Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 2 at Dollars 72 3/4 , Digital
Equipment Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 35 1/4 and Compaq Dollars 2 1/4
higher at Dollars 50 1/2 .
Sunbeam-Oster fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 on the news that Mr Paul
Kazarian, chairman of the consumer products company, had been unexpectedly
sacked by the board of directors over the weekend. At least one broking
house, PaineWebber, immediately downgraded the stock on the news, citing the
short-term uncertain outlook for the company following Mr Kazarian's
departure.
EXEL fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44 in response to a disappointing set of
fourth quarter profits, slightly below the Dollars 76.7m the Bermuda-based
insurance company earned a year ago.
Nantucket Industries dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 12 on the American
Stock Exchange after the company reported fiscal third quarter earnings of
18 cents a share, only slightly higher than a year ago and below market
expectations.
Canada
TORONTO SHARE prices ended steady in active trading. The 300 composite index
was down 1.57 points, or 0.05%, to 3,310.2, as advances led declines by 323
to 290.
The volume of 44m shares was below Friday's 52m shares. Trading value was
CDollars 371m compared with CDollars 386m.
BioChem Pharma, which rose CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 20 3/4 , was one of
the top picks for 1993 by a Hambrecht &amp; Quist biotechnology analyst. The
analyst also believes that 1993 will be a banner year for the industry in
terms of product development.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens as Hong
Kong gains 2.6 per cent

THE NIKKEI average traded in a narrow range yesterday before slipping
slightly towards the close, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo.
The index closed down 45.14 at 16,589.55, its fifth consecutive fall, having
seen a low of 16,532.06 and a high of 16,698.30.
Declines outnumbered advances by 577 to 277, with 226 unchanged.
Participation weakened, and volume dropped to an estimated 120m shares after
221m on Friday. The Topix index of all first section shares lost 5.59 to
1,283.93 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.13 to 1,042.42.
Weekend reports that the ministry of finance had requested banks not to sell
stocks, hoping to enhance balance sheets in time for the end of the
financial year in March, were not enough to improve sentiment. Arbitrageurs,
public pension funds and investment trusts continued to be the main players,
with few individual buyers attracted to the market.
Ms Kathy Matsui, a strategist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, predicted that
the Nikkei would continue to drift above the 16,000 mark in the first
quarter. 'We really do need some measures on behalf of the government to
stimulate confidence. There is nothing further that can be done from the
corporate sector or the financial sector to boost the economy,' she said.
Profit-taking continued to weaken many shares which had made gains on news
of the crown prince's engagement late last week, particularly in the paper
and printing sectors. Oji Paper lost Y4 to Y862, Mitsubishi Paper Mills fell
Y12 to Y545, and Kanzaki Paper dropped Y18 to Y606.
However, department stores and television companies continued to do well out
of the imperial wedding. Mitsukoshi gained Y1 to Y731, Takashimaya advanced
Y6 to Y902 and Marui put on Y20 to Y1,120. Nippon Television Network rose
Y1,100 to Y14,800.
The banking sector was generally weaker. Industrial Bank of Japan dropped
Y20 to Y2,350, Bank of Tokyo fell Y30 to Y1,250, Mitsubishi Bank lost Y40 to
Y2,210, and Daiwa Bank closed down Y34 at Y916. Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sakura,
Fuji and Sumitomo banks experienced similar declines.
Kawasaki Steel and Nippon Steel both closed unchanged after heavy trading.
Victor Co of Japan (JVC) eased after recent gains, closing at Y840, down
Y20.
In Osaka the OSE index dropped 89.25 to 18,309.73 in volume of 49.7m shares.
Roundup
WEAKNESS on Wall Street gave some of the region's markets a poor start to
the week, but a number made gains. Bombay was closed due to violence in the
city.
HONG KONG ended 2.6 per cent higher on overseas buying which some local
analysts viewed as over-optimistic. The Hang Seng index closed 143.54 higher
at 5,673.10, its day's high. Turnover was more than HKDollars 2.3bn, well
above the depressed levels of last week.
UK institutions led the buying on apparently conciliatory comments by
Chinese leaders on Friday on the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's plans for
political reform. Among the most active stocks, HSBC was HKDollars 3.00
higher at HKDollars 59.00.
AUSTRALIA bounced back after three days of heavy losses. After sinking below
1,500 in the morning on heavy futures selling, the All Ordinaries index
closed 11.8 higher at 1,514.1, off a low of 1,487.6.
Thin trading contributed to the market's volatility. BHP and CRA led the
recovery, both rising to ADollars 13, up 18 cents and 30 cents respectively.
TAIWAN, which had extended its recovery on Saturday with a 2.6 per cent gain
on hopes that parliament would vote to cut the stock transaction tax as
early as this week, focused on Finance Ministry opposition to the move and
fell 2.6 per cent, the weighted index closing 82.81 lower at 3,171.24.
Brokers said that investor confidence remained very weak ahead of a cabinet
reshuffle expected by early February.
NEW ZEALAND blamed the Dow and a thin summer market as the NZSE-40 index
closed down 26.90 at 1,499.96. Volume was a very thin NZDollars 10.2m.
SINGAPORE looked for a first-quarter rally, but failed to get it as
sentiment was dampened by a weaker Malaysian market; the Straits Times
Industrial index fell 12.20 to 1,543.96. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index fell
8.05 to 621.46, weakened by talk that Malayan Banking is planning a
one-for-four rights issue.
BANGKOK's banks slowed down after last week's gains but the SET index was
still 5.91 higher at 926.70 in turnover of Bt8.80bn. Thai Farmers Bank
gained Bt8 to Bt772, Bank of Ayudhya Bt2.50 to Bt28.75 and Krung Thai Bank
Bt10 to Bt348, while Bangkok Bank was unchanged at Bt101.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland rises as door opens to
foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland stood out with a 9.1 per cent gain in local currency terms, while
poor performances in Japan and on Wall Street left the FT-Actuaries World
Index 1.1 per cent lower in the first trading week of 1993.
The abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership of Finnish shares and a
change in the tax regime in favour of equities have provided further reasons
to buy into the Helsinki stock market. It received a boost late last year by
the devaluation of the markka, which should greatly improve Finland's
international competitiveness.
Mr Christian Diebitsch at Kleinwort Benson also points to the successful
conclusion of the 1993 wage round and the government's survival in recent
local elections for his house's positive stance towards Finland. The country
is also expected to enjoy modest growth in GDP this year after two years of
falls.
The prospect of a devaluation in the punt prompted a 6.8 per cent rise in
Ireland in local terms, though in sterling terms the rise was only 3.6 per
cent. Other gainers on the week included Norway, up 4.9 per cent in response
to a cut in interest rates, while South Africa added 4.1 per cent thanks to
a strong rise in De Beers in the wake of better-than-expected 1992 diamond
sales.
Japan declined 1.5 per cent in spite of the announcement on Thursday of the
engagement of the Crown Prince Naruhito which raised hopes that the royal
wedding would have some positive impact on the economy.
Analysts at Nomura Research Institute say that even if there is a rush of
copy-cat marriages in Japan, say of 10 per cent, creating an extra Y500bn
(Dollars 4bn) of demand, this would only account for about 0.1 per cent of
GNP.
US equities suffered a similar fall, weighed down by unease about
developments in the Middle East and unexpectedly weak employment figures for
December.

FT  12 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Middle East fears put bourses
in cautious mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street's fall on Friday and weakness in London yesterday contributed to
the cautious mood on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS fell on Middle East jitters which made fund managers reluctant to
commit themselves either way to the market. The CAC-40 index fell 38.05 to
1,814.58 in modest turnover of FFr2.1bn.
Lafarge Coppee fell FFr6.90 to FFr330 on news that its US unit will record a
Dollars 62m exceptional loss on 1992 accounts due to new US accounting rules
regarding post-retirement benefits and income tax expenses.
Air Liquide, which also has a US subsidiary, lost FFr21 to FFr754, on fears
that it might have to do the same thing.
Weak oil prices weighed on Total, down FFr5 to FFr235 and Elf, down FFr15.20
to FFr341.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by weakness in the transport sector while Royal
Dutch shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 147.40 after Hoare Govett downgraded the stock to a
'sell' after forecasting dividends in 1992 and 1993 of Fl 8.35 after Fl 8.20
in 1991. The CBS Tendency Index lost 0.6 to 96.0.
Nedlloyd lost Fl 3.00 or 10 per cent to Fl 27.40 as selling accelerated on
last week's news that Mr Torstein Hagen had reduced his stake and had
resigned from the supervisory board. KLM weakened Fl 1.20 to Fl 24.40 on
unsubstantiated reports that it was losing some Fl 2m a day while Frans Maas
shed Fl 2.50 to Fl 44.50 after forecasting sharply lower earnings in 1993.
Hagemeyer went against the trend with a gain of Fl 8.00 or 6.2 per cent to
Fl 136.00 on better than expected 1992 results and a positive 1993 forecast.
MILAN fell in technical trading ahead of the expiry of options contracts
tomorrow. However, dealers reported that the lira's weakness was encouraging
some buying by foreigners. The Comit index fell 7.48 or 1.6 per cent to
449.21 in turnover estimated at around Friday's L225.9bn.
Domestic political worries, as the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left
prepared a vote of no-confidence in the four-party coalition, also weighed
on the market.
Fiat was fixed L110 lower at L4,155 and slid to L4,065 after hours on a
newspaper report that Italian car sales fell 8.5 per cent in December from
the year-ago period. After the close, the trade group, Anfia, said that car
deliveries fell 6.36 per cent year-on-year in December.
FRANKFURT saw mark-ups among carmakers, mild weakness in banks and an
average performance from chemicals as the DAX index closed a mere 0.44
higher at 1,531.96.
Turnover was said to be thin again, after Friday's DM3.7bn. Daimler led the
carmakers higher with a rise of DM6 to DM538.30 but analysts said that this
was merely a reaction to last week's losses in the shares after a hefty 1993
earnings downgrade by brokers James Capel.
In the same sector Volkswagen ended DM2 higher at DM256.50. Analysts expect
its management to discuss a programme to cut costs significantly at a board
meeting tomorrow.
MADRID ran into selling pressure in the afternoon and the general index
closed down 0.79 at 219.37. Endesa slipped Pta110 to Pta3,900 on
profit-taking.
FG Inversiones Bursatiles said at a presentation in London yesterday that it
was recommending defensive stocks 'with clear overweightings in the
electricity sector and motorways'. The Madrid broker continued to believe
that the first-half of the year was unlikely to see much of a market rally,
and that investors should reduce positions above 220 on the general index.
ZURICH dropped and rumours about Nestle were mainly to blame in spite of a
denial by the food company that it was planning a rights issue. Nestle
bearers fell SFr50 to SFr1,080 and the SMI index closed 25.4 lower at
2,049.5.
Bearers in the arms and engineering group, Oerlikon-Buhrle, rose SFr35 to
SFr400 after a Sunday newspaper report that first payments had been received
on an arms deal announced last March.
BRUSSELS concentrated on Delhaize, up BFr50 or 4.8 per cent to BFr1,278
after it reported a better than expected 5 per cent increase in 1992
earnings and a rise in the dividend after Friday's close. The Bel-20 index
closed just 0.14 ahead at 1,144.11 in turnover of BFr1.1bn.
STOCKHOLM fell, but closed above early lows after publication of the budget
for the fiscal year ending June 1994. Rising money market rates also weighed
on prices. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.2 to 943.1 in turnover of
SKr602m after Friday's SKr946m.
Astra attracted more profit-taking, its A shares falling SKr10 to SKr716.
OSLO continued its downward correction, pulled down by losses in Kvaerner
and Norsk Hydro. The all-share index shed 3.41 to 385.86 in light turnover
of NKr147m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr1 to NKr163, while Kvaerner ended down NKr4
at NKr156.
HELSINKI was pulled down by the bank index which dropped 17.8 per cent on
government plans to cut the nominal value on bank shares in compensation for
state support. The Hex index fell 16.79 or 1.9 per cent to 888.3, closing
above its early lows.
ISTANBUL closed at its highest level since late September on expectations of
good 1992 company results. The 75-share index improved 24.85 to 4,163.13 in
turnover of TL195bn.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Money Markets: A less bullish tone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market dealers started the week believing that another cut in German
rates was certain to come before the spring, but the tone of yesterday's
trading was noticeably less bullish than last week's, writes James Blitz.
Last Thursday's 15 basis-point reduction in German money market rates has
led many operators to believe that the Bundesbank could aggressively ease
policy as early as next month.
However, even before Christmas the market was pricing more than 100 basis
points off three-month money by the end of the first quarter of this year.
There were limits, therefore, to the extent that last week's small easing by
the Bundesbank could boost sentiment in markets.
In a day devoid of any news in terms of indicators or policy, the March
Euromark contract fell back 16 basis points, bottoming out at 92.05. It
later closed at 92.06. At this level it prices three-month money at 7.94 per
cent in mid-March, some 60 points below the current level.
One London-based dealer was not at all surprised that the market had failed
to consolidate last week's rally. 'We were setting a new high of 92.32 for
the March contract last Tuesday,' he said. 'Yet, when the Bundesbank cut
money market rates on Thursday, the contract failed to break through to a
new level.'
He suggested that the contract had failed to go any higher for want of any
news.
The fall in Euromarks had a depressive effect on French franc futures. The
March contract declined 14 basis points to finish at 90.45, a level that
assumes that three-month money in March will be at 9.55 per cent.
French cash rates were softer for the third day running. Three-month money
ended at 11 7/8 per cent, down from a previous close of 12 per cent.
In the sterling market, the Bank of England's forecast of a shortage of
Pounds 200m was far smaller than some dealers had expected, although it was
revised to Pounds 300m in the afternoon and was fully removed.
Three-month money closed slightly softer at 7 1/8 per cent, from 7 1/4 per
cent on Friday night. The March short sterling contract finished 4 basis
points down at 93.29. Dealers said the market remained uncertain about the
timing of the next move in UK rates.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Punt returns to ERM bands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR was more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark at one stage in
European trading yesterday as currency dealers continued to respond to last
Friday's disappointing employment report in the US, writes James Blitz.
The US currency's weakness yesterday was not the product of D-Mark strength.
The German currency was virtually unmoved against the French franc in quiet
markets.
Indeed, the Irish punt, which is still seen by some dealers as a devaluation
candidate, enjoyed some firmness in Europe's exchange rate mechanism against
the D-Mark bloc of currencies.
Instead, last Friday's US non-farm payroll report, which rose by 64,000 in
December when the market had been expecting a 100,000 increase, continued to
cast a shadow over the dollar.
The market is more confident about the prospects for US economic recovery.
But the dollar has risen by around 10 pfennigs since December 18, when it
was around DM1.55, and such a rise needs to be accompanied by very strong
data if it is to be sustained.
'A period of profit-taking after such a rise was inevitable,' said Mr Steve
Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.6305, down from a previous close of
DM1.6375. But in New York it later improved to finish at DM1.6340.
In Europe, the main focus continued to be on the Irish punt, which traded
below its ERM floors against two currencies last week. For most of
yesterday, the Irish currency was back inside its ERM bands against the
Belgian franc and Dutch guilder.
Having avoided a devaluation at the weekend, as many had feared, the
currency enjoyed some renewed confidence. Any speculator borrowing punts
overnight at the current rate of 100 per cent must hope for an imminent
devaluation if a profit is to be made.
The punt appreciated to about BFr54.30 to the Belgian franc and NFl 2.9595
to the Dutch guilder towards the end of European trading. Rates for lending
overnight money softened a little from the heights of 100 per cent seen last
Friday.
Attention was also focused on the Italian lira, which continued to
appreciate strongly against most other currencies. At one point yesterday it
was trading at L907 to the D-Mark, some 4.8 per cent higher than its level
of L950 last Tuesday.
The Italian government's DM4bn bond issue had a good response, as did
statements that the lira could re-enter the ERM this year. Mr Avinash
Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, pointed out that the
net yield on Italian bonds is currently running at 13 1/2 per cent. 'The
high yields on Italian paper go some way to explaining this recent
appreciation in the currency,' he said.
The French franc enjoyed another quiet day against the D-Mark, ending at
FFr3.400 to the German unit after a previous close of FFr3.402.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian project 'is dead, but
won't lie down' - Bernard Simon explains reluctance to mothball the troubled
Hibernia development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY INVESTOR interested in a cheap but potentially troublesome stake in
Canada's most ambitious energy project should get in touch with the
government in Ottawa. A warm and generous welcome is assured.
The authorities have been scouring the international oil industry for
someone to take up to 25 per cent of the Hibernia field, now under
construction off the south-east coast of Newfoundland. The stake became
available last summer when Gulf Canada Resources decided to walk away from
Hibernia to concentrate on projects in western Canada with faster and more
certain returns. Despite an array of financial incentives, the response from
other investors has so far been less than enthusiastic. Those wooed have
ranged from the big US oil companies to Mitsubishi of Japan and Finland's
Neste Oy. Texaco showed some interest but then backed away, citing
prohibitive insurance costs. Latest reports suggest that Arkansas-based
Murphy Oil may buy a small shareholding.
Should no one step forward to take the full 25 per cent (as seems probable),
the project is likely to survive only if the government itself becomes a
shareholder. The Ottawa government thus faces the unpleasant choice between
pulling the plug on a high-profile mega-project or pumping even more
taxpayers' money into a commercially and technologically risky venture.
Hibernia seemed a viable proposition when it was first discovered in 1979
during the days of soaring oil prices. More recently however, the CDollars
5.2bn (Pounds 2.65bn) project has been propelled more by the politics of
regional development than by sound commercial judgment. Handsome government
incentives, including CDollars 1bn in grants and CDollars 1.7bn in loan
guarantees, lured a four-member consortium led by Mobil Oil Canada to start
developing the field in 1990.
Even with these subsidies however, the partners require an oil price of
between USDollars 18 and Dollars 21 a barrel (at 1990 prices) to earn a
reasonable return from Hibernia's expected output of 110,000 barrels a day.
World oil prices are at present hovering around Dollars 18 a barrel.
Gulf's financial contributions come to an end this week when total spending
on Hibernia passes the CDollars 1bn mark. The Calgary-based company has sunk
about CDollars 200m into the project in the past three years and still faces
a write-down of up to CDollars 300m on its investment.
The company failed to find a buyer for its stake and after an exhaustive
study, it urged the government and the remaining three partners - Mobil,
Chevron and Petro-Canada - to mothball Hibernia. But the others chose to
press ahead, although construction work was slowed down, delaying initial
production from 1996 to 1997.
The advantages of Hibernia for Mobil and Petro-Canada include deductibility
of future outlays from their rising tax liabilities. Furthermore, the
Geological Survey of Canada estimates that the Hibernia field contains only
about 15 per cent of reserves in the area. Mr Jim Doak, analyst at First
Marathon Securities in Toronto, says the remaining partners may have an eye
on future participation in other fields, such as Avalon and Terra Nova.
Avalon's reserves are thought to be substantially higher than Hibernia's
685m barrels. Terra Nova is smaller, but could probably be exploited from a
floating production platform rather than the costly and risky concrete
gravity-base system being built for Hibernia.
The pressure to stick with Hibernia is most intense on the government. Not
only is a general election looming later this year, but the offshore
development is at present one of the few generators of economic activity in
Newfoundland. The province's economy has shrunk by more than 3 per cent in
the past two years, largely as a result of a moratorium on cod fishing
designed to replenish depleted stocks in the North Atlantic. The government
estimates that cancellation of the Hibernia project would push the
province's real domestic product down by 3 per cent between 1992 and 1996.
According to the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, Hibernia 'is almost
indispensable to the provincial economy'. At a time when unemployment in
Newfoundland is running at almost 22 per cent, Hibernia has created about
1,100 jobs, mainly related to construction of the concrete production
platform.
Not everyone is convinced however, that Hibernia is the best way of securing
the province's long-term prosperity. Mr Wade Locke, an economics professor
at Memorial University in St John's, is convinced that Newfoundland could
have generated more economic activity simply by investing the CDollars 1bn
government grant in the bond market and spending the interest on
job-creation schemes.
Much of the engineering and construction work for Hibernia is taking place
outside Newfoundland, mainly in Paris and Montreal.
Mr Locke also questions whether technology used for Hibernia's concrete
gravity base or the site where the production platform is being assembled
will be of much use for future oilfields off the east coast.
Whatever the economic arguments in favour of killing the project, Hibernia
has built up so much momentum that it would take a brave politician to try
to stop it now. In response to an editorial titled 'Hibernia Death Watch' in
the Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister
and Newfoundland's most vociferous supporter in the government, declared
that 'she's dead, but she won't lie down'. Mr Crosbie asserted bluntly that
'one of this century's great frontier projects will go forward despite the
difficulties and obstacles'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago lumber prices soar as
weather cuts supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL constraints on logging in the US Pacific north-west have
gradually slowed lumber deliveries to the US housing industry, and now heavy
snows and frigid weather in logging and saw mill regions have cut lumber
supplies to a trickle.
Tight supplies of Canadian spruce turned up the heat in the lumber futures
pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week, with prices hitting their
highest levels in the 15-year life of the contract. Lumber futures for
delivery this month reached an all-time high of Dollars 304.60 per thousand
board feet Friday, and climbed to Dollars 315.50 yesterday morning.
The normally sleepy lumber futures pit at the CME has long been a barometer
of US economic health. Strong lumber demand generally reflects a healthy US
housing market. Lately, low interest rates and slow but steady economic
growth have helped set a bullish tone in lumber prices as traders have
anticipated a revival in home-building.
However, volume and volatility caught fire in late November as logging
channels in Oregon and Washington state timber regions were hit by extreme
winter weather. The freeze continued through the Christmas holidays, with
temperatures so cold that saw mills could not operate at full capacity even
when they had timber on hand. The weather caused a supply squeeze just as
demand was perking up.
Mr Curt Cunningham, an analyst with Pacific Futures Trading in Seattle,
Washington, said lumber wholesalers started the winter season with low
stocks. 'Dealers depleted inventories all through the fall, and then in
November had to buy up enormous amounts of wood to keep up their stocks,' he
said. And while adverse weather in the Pacific north-west was shutting down
lumber production, in most of the rest of the US it was warmer than usual,
and conducive to building, stepping up lumber demand. Wholesalers are
reporting that the normal three-week order backlog has grown to five weeks.
Mr Cunningham thought the recent price run-up in lumber futures might be
reaching its peak, as the January contract goes off the board this week.
While some may worry that the lumber futures price may be distorted by its
relatively small size - only 1,252 contracts were traded on Friday  -
analysts say futures prices have been tracking underlying cash indices
faithfully.
Analysts say a fundamental shift in north-west logging practices may
continue to keep the heat on in the lumber futures pit in Chicago. The US
logging industry depends heavily on federal timber lands. Pressure from
environmentalists and outdoorsmen has limited availability, with sales of
federal timber down 51.6 per cent in 1992 from 1990.

The London GOLD price moved to a fresh 7-year low in late trading, following
the trend in New York, where the tone was undermined by Middle East selling.
Earlier steadiness in European markets had been attributed to central bank
activity. 'No-one wants to buy gold,' commented one New York analyst;
'there's no inflation to speak of.' At the London Metal Exchange COPPER
prices reversed the uptrend of late last week with cash metal ending Pounds
46.50 down at Pounds 1,492.50 a tonne. Dealers said this reflected the
presence of China, which last week had been a persistent buyer, as a net
seller. ALUMINIUM prices rose in late trading on widespread talk of US
production or smelter power problems. The three months price closed at
Dollars 1,242.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35.75 from Friday, and moved on to
Dollars 1,248 in kerb (after hours) trading. Earlier news that International
Primary Aluminium Institute producer stocks fell by 28,000 tonnes in
November was only marginally supportive as some dealers had expected a much
larger fall. Other metals were mostly lower.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market steadier despite
Opec worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES moved up slightly yesterday, but the underlying tone remained
weak as traders saw no evidence of output cuts from the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and demand in Europe stayed low.
North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery was 10 cents higher at
Dollars 17.65 a barrel in a fairly quiet market. Severe storms in the North
Sea continued to affect oil production and Statoil, Norway's state oil
company, said Norwegian production was half its usual 2.3m barrels a day.
In addition, Mobil, an offshoot of the large US company, said it had cut
production from its 110,000 b/d Beryl field by a half. Production has been
reined back because of the difficulties in docking tankers in the gales to
pick up the oil.
But in spite of problems in the North Sea, market observers say there is
still too much oil in the world market. Traders have seen few efforts on the
part of Opec countries to staunch their flows of oil in accordance with a
plan to cut output agreed in November.
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the industry newsletter, estimated last month
that Opec had produced more than 25m b/d compared with the agreed ceiling of
24.58m b/d. It said yesterday that the only cuts evident were price cuts.
However, Saudi Arabia has signalled its willingness to reduce its own output
at the organisation's February meeting if others cut back too.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norilsk manager reveals nickel
ouput
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S GIANT Norilsk Nickel company produced 240,000 tonnes of nickel in
1992, according to Mr Sergei Korneyev, the sales and purchasing manager,
reports Reuter from Moscow.
He said the Interfax news agency's report that the company exported between
60,000 and 65,000 tonnes of nickel in 1992 was correct 'plus or minus 10 per
cent'.
He gave no comparisons for 1991 production or exports.
It is the first time the traditionally secretive plant has outlined
production figures. Officials said last year they expected 1992 output to
fall by 15 per cent in line with a general decline in Russian industry, but
they gave no absolute figures.
Data on output of precious and strategic metals were traditionally kept
secret in the former Soviet Union and Russian producers have also been
reluctant to release figures. But information has been trickling out in
recent months, providing important clues to Russia's role as an exporter and
producer on world markets.
Norilsk, with plants in Siberia and on the Kola peninsula, accounts for
about 80 per cent of Russian nickel production.
It is also an important copper producer, but Mr Korneyev said Interfax's
figures of 1992 output of 450,000 tonnes copper were 'slightly exaggerated'.
Interfax said nickel exports from the whole of the Commonwealth of
Independent States probably totalled 120,000 tonnes, up from 100,000 tonnes
in 1991. But Korneyev said it was impossible to determine total CIS nickel
exports because the metal was being exported by other companies and from
stocks as well as by Norilsk. 'The full figure for exports will come later
from customs data,' he said.
There have also been complaints that large amounts of nickel and other
non-ferrous metals have been smuggled out of Russia, mostly via the Baltic
states.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia expects bigger
coconut crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COCONUT production is expected to rise by 3.4 per cent this year,
leading to an increase in the exports of coconut products such as oil, copra
meal and copra, according to the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community. The
APCC, whose members account for over 80 per cent of the world crop, estimate
1993 production at 9.2m tonnes copra equivalent, up from 8.9m tonnes last
year.
Indonesia is expected to remain the largest producer with a crop this year
of 2.4m tonnes copra equivalent, followed by the Philippines with 2.2m
tonnes and India with 1.5m tonnes.
World exports of coconut oil are forecast to rise less than 2 per cent this
year to 1.5m tonnes, although much depends on how Indonesian producers react
to the decline in the world price, which fell 26 per cent last year to end
1992 at Dollars 470 a tonne.
Indonesia exported an estimated 300,000 tonnes of coconut oil in 1992, up
from 197,633 tonnes in 1991 but, industry officials say, producers can
switch back to the domestic market, which consumes up to 800,000 tonnes a
year.
APCC officials say the world price of coconut oil will also depend on world
production of palm kernel oil, its main competitor, which has risen steadily
from 1m tonnes in 1987 to 1.48m tonnes by 1991.
World exports of copra meal, used for animal feed, are forecast to reach 1m
tonnes this year, up from 952,000 in 1992. APCC officials say European
Community toxin regulations have curtailed EC imports of copra meal and the
world price of copra meal fell 10 per cent last year to Dollars 143 a tonne.
World exports of copra are forecast to rise 14 per cent to 255,500 tonnes
this year, whilst those of desiccated coconut are expected to reach 203,000
tonnes, up 3 per cent on last year.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minister sparks row over
Zambian copper finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURIOUS row has been sparked by Mr Mathias Mphande, Zambia's deputy
minister of mines, who has suggested that Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines,
which accounts for about 5 per cent of western world copper mine output, is
in a perilous financial position.
The company, the world's second-largest quoted copper producer after Phelps
Dodge of the US, is preparing to refute Mr Mphande's remarks and in the
meantime the London-based Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services group
yesterday rushed out a note to clients about ZCCM's finances.
This included a statement that, after seven months of the present financial
year, the company's attributable earnings of Dollars 89m were 400 per cent
ahead of those for the same months in 1991-92 and it had enjoyed a cash
inflow of about Dollars 60m.
CLL has a vested interest in the affair because its clients own about 8.5
per cent of ZCCM's shares. Another 27 per cent is owned by Zambia Copper
Investments, in which Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo
American Corporation of South Africa, has a substantial interest, and 60 per
cent is owned by the Zambian government.
In remarks quoted by Zambia's Weekly Post, Mr Mphande called for the rapid
privatisation of ZCCM to free it, he said, from the political interference
that contributed to its troubles. He was quoted as saying ZCCM could face
closure if it failed to raise Dollars 2bn. 'ZCCM has no money and, since it
is not making money, it is unable to service its loans,' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at CLL, pointed out yesterday that, under the
new regime in Zambia, ZCCM operated independently and the government
exercised influence only through its three board directors. He said he had
contacted ZCCM and had been told that copper production after seven months
was running 10 per cent ahead of last year's level. (In the year to March 31
ZCCM produced about 387,000 tonnes of copper.)
Mr Coulson said ZCCM's pre-tax profits, at about Dollars 168m after seven
months, were 100 per cent ahead of budget. He added: 'Additionally,
virtually all the company's financial ratios are comfortably within
internationally accepted norms'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts ease at long end on funding worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds lost three-quarters of a point at the long end as
funding worries dominated the gilt market yesterday.
Dealers expect the Bank of England to announce details of a gilt auction
shortly, with the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007 emerging as the expected
auction stock. The 15-year gilt is already fairly liquid, with about Pounds
3bn of existing stock.
However, there is already an overhang of gilts as the Bank of England
announced a Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 at the end
of last month, and dealers estimate between half and a quarter of that has
been sold.
The market took little cheer from weekend press reports which suggested the
government was unlikely to raise taxes in order to cut the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement. 'The gilt market would like to see a hike in taxes to
reduce the PSBR', said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds.
Economists forecast the Bank of England will have to issue about Pounds 50bn
of gilts in 1993-94.
The Liffe gilt future, which closed on Friday at 100.20, fell to a low of
99.24 before ending the day at around 99.28. In the cash market, the 11 3/4
per cent gilt due 2003/07 dropped from 119 7/8 to 119 to yield 8.85 per
cent.
THE Swedish bond market suffered from a crisis of confidence yesterday. Mr
Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor was quoted at the weekend as saying
there would be no interest rate cuts in the foreseeable future. Yesterday's
budget announcement did little to reassure traders. The 1992-93 budget
estimate of close to SKr200bn is widely believed to be over-optimistic.
Finally, at yesterday's auction of SKr3bn of 2001 bonds and 1999 bonds,
there were insufficient bids to cover the amount of 2001 bonds on offer.
Ten-year bond yields rose 14 basis points to 10.27 per cent, as the yield
curve steepened further. With a new 16-year bond due to be auctioned on
January 26, the market is becoming increasingly nervous, according to Jouni
Kokko, an international economist at S. G. Warburg.
GERMAN government bonds slid a  1/4 -point on fears that the recent rally
had been exaggerated. The bond market has already discounted substantial
German rate cuts and traders are becoming rather nervous that, if these
interest rate reductions do not start to materialise, there will be little
to underpin the market at current levels. However, the poor state of the
German economy continues to fuel hopes that the discount rate will be cut
soon, following last week's trimming of the German repo rate.
THE French bond market suffered from a bout of profit taking, losing a 1/4
 point following gains last week. Uncertainty over the currency and the
general election in March have undermined confidence in the market following
last week's rally, traders said.
US Treasury prices posted modest gains across the maturity range yesterday
as investors kept a nervous eye on developments in the Middle East. In late
trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 5/32 at 101 29/32 ,
yielding 7.458 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was also slightly firmer, up  3/32 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.423 per cent.
Trading was described as cautious by dealers, with investors apparently
encouraged by the market's rebound from last week's heavy losses, but
concerned about the crisis in the Middle East, where Iraq continued to
challenge the US and its allies. Prices were also constrained by supply
issues, with new corporate, municipal and federal government debt weighing
heavily on the market.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Warm response for Ontario's Dollars 3bn
global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Province of Ontario's third global bond received an enthusiastic welcome
in the international bond markets yesterday. The 10-year issue, which will
be priced today to yield between 76 and 79 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries, was increased to Dollars 3bn after being launched at Dollars
2.5bn. That makes it one of the largest fixed-rate dollar issues to date,
equalling the UK's last December.
Bankers said the indicated pricing looked very fair. Salomon Brothers,
leading the issue with Goldman Sachs, agreed the spread was high, but said
it is not out of line with secondary market prices. The increase reflects
the relative shortage of dollar supply in the Euromarkets and the
re-weighting by fund managers towards dollar assets, it said.
This completes the province's budgeted 1992-93 borrowing programme and
prefunds part of its 1993-94 requirement. Ontario plans to borrow CDollars
9.2bn (USDollars 7.6bn) in the next fiscal year, to cover a projected
deficit of CDollars 8.1bn and CDollars 1.1bn of refinancings. Of the total,
it will raise around 60 per cent internationally.
Deutsche Bank in London's Dollars 100m, 10-year collared floating rate note
issue for the Province of British Columbia offers a minimum coupon of 5 1/2
per cent, an indication that such rates are edging up. Deutsche Bank said
the issue is structured as senior debt rather than subordinated debt, and
was based on orders from investors switching out of existing collared
floaters with lower minimum coupons. Much of the demand came from Germany,
said Deutsche Bank, which kept 70 per cent of the issue on its own books.
Portugal is set to become the latest European sovereign to borrow in the
international bond market, writes Richard Waters.
Portugal is under little pressure to raise the Dollars 3bn ceiling it has
set for foreign borrowing this year, said Mr Manuel Pinho, director of the
Treasury, in London this week to brief investors on the country's borrowing
plans. It has a budgeted government deficit of around 4 per cent in the next
fiscal year, and foreign exchange reserves standing at Dollars 20bn, up from
Dollars 7.5bn three years earlier. However, it sees foreign borrowing as a
way of reducing overall borrowing costs and opening up the market for other
Portuguese public sector borrowers in future.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: LCH seeks Pounds 120m
guarantee from holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LACK of insurance cover and an unwillingness by enough banks to back it,
has forced the London Clearing House, which clears all transactions on
London's futures and options exchanges, to turn to shareholders for a Pounds
120m (Dollars 180m) guarantee facility.
The clearing house has been unable to renew its Pounds 170m insurance policy
from Trade Indemnity, which runs out at the end of January.
The policy is available to settle transactions if both margin payments put
up by members of the exchanges and a Pounds 30m guarantee from LCH's
shareholders, prove inadequate.
Mr David Hardy, LCH managing director, said the clearing house was not alone
in seeing cover withdrawn, but it reflected an unwillingness by reinsurers
to take on financial guarantee business.
The clearing house also tried to arrange a syndicated bank guarantee
facility through Commerzbank, paying banks a fee of 65 basis points a year
for providing the backing.
Too few banks came forward, however, and LCH has now turned to its six
shareholder banks: Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster, Midland, Royal
Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. The fee to be paid on the facility
has not been disclosed, but is believed to be more than 65 basis points.
Mr Hardy said yesterday that the reduction in cover would not lead to any
reduction in the level of security on the exchanges and the Pounds 170m
insurance cover had only been raised to that level from Pounds 120m a year
ago after underwriters had indicated a willingness to provide the extra
cover at little extra cost.
Banco Espanol de Credito has set a Dollars 1bn Euro-commercial paper
programme which is backed by corporate loans to prime Spanish names, Reuter
reports.
JP Morgan, the arranger, said that the securitised deal is the first of its
kind in Europe.

DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank, the big Japanese bank, is closing its representative
office in Bombay after seven years of operation.
The closure of the office, which has a staff of three, is part of a
restructuring of Dai-Ichi worldwide.
The move partly reflects the fall in the volume of Indian government
commercial loan issues following the downgrading of India's credit rating 18
months ago by Standard and Poor's, the US rating agency.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy may consider Dollars
15bn borrowing programme this year

ITALY yesterday returned to the Eurobond market, after a two-year absence,
with a DM4bn (Dollars 2.5bn) issue in what could be the start of a Dollars
15bn international borrowing programme this year.
Pricing for the five-year bond, which marks the second biggest D-Mark
Eurobond issued and Italy's borrowing debut in the German currency, will be
revealed this afternoon.
Bankers expect the transaction to offer a yield spread of between 45 and 50
basis points (0.45 to 0.5 percentage points) over the yield of five-year
German government bonds.
Pricing is likely to be a sensitive issue. Italy has seen its credit rating
tumble following last year's political and currency turmoil, plus
international banking dissatisfaction with the government's attitude to the
debts of the Efim state holding company, now in voluntary liquidation.
Having benefited from the triple-A rating until the early 1990s, which
allowed it to borrow at the cheapest rates, Italy last year suffered a
two-notch cut in its rating by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit
rating agency.
Political approval for major budget cuts, principally a L93bn (Dollars 62m)
budget reduction package this year, has been among the prime factors in
influencing Italy's return to the Euromarkets.
Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the Italian treasury, said the
government would like to borrow between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn this
year, subject to investor demand and market conditions. That would be two
and a half times the level of borrowing at the peak of Italy's Euromarket
activity in 1990.
Future issues would be in a range of currencies and at either fixed or
floating interest rates. Italy also retained its commitment to the Ecu
market, he said. Italy's last Euromarket issue was a Ecu2.5bn issue in
February 1991.
The D-Mark bond is likely to involve around 30 banks, comprising German,
Italian and leading international financial institutions.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank board member responsible for corporate
finance, indicated the response had been good so far and a 'good share' of
the paper had been placed already.
Borrowing in D-Marks should help Italy reduce its large debt-servicing costs
in the long-term. Five-year German interest rates are currently more than 5
percentage points below equivalent rates in lira, while demand for D-Mark
paper has opened a substantial window of opportunity for many borrowers to
issue at attractive spreads.
Last November, the UK took advantage of the market by launching a DM5.5bn
issue, also led by Deutsche Bank, at just 10 basis points over equivalent
German paper.
The new issue will strengthen the reserves of the Bank of Italy, which were
sorely depleted in defending the lira prior to its 7 per cent devaluation
and subsequent departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September. The
issue should also help to create a Euromarket benchmark in D-Marks for other
Italian borrowers.

MELLON BANK of Pittsburgh yesterday reported a 56 per cent jump in its
full-year 1992 net profits, to Dollars 437m. Earnings per share for 1992
were Dollars 6.96, against Dollars 4.66 in 1991.
Fourth-quarter net income was 46 per cent higher at Dollars 105m, or Dollars
1.62 a share against Dollars 1.11 in 1991.
Mr Frank Cahouet, chairman and chief executive, said the bank's credit
quality improved during 1992, a year that also saw the acquisition of The
Boston Company and 27 branches from Meritor, the former Philadelphia-based
savings bank.
The fourth quarter saw 17 per cent higher net interest income of Dollars
301m and a 21 per cent rise in fee income to Dollars 228m. Bad debt
provisions were Dollars 35m, down from Dollars 75m in the same quarter of
1991. For the whole of 1992, Mellon's bad debt provisions were Dollars 185m,
down from Dollars 250m in 1991.

THE joint administrators of the private side of the empire of the late Mr
Robert Maxwell have sold their remaining 50 per cent shareholding in Thomas
Cook Travel, the Massachusetts-based travel business that used to be
wholly-owned by Mr Maxwell.
The buyer of the company - which last year had Dollars 1.7bn of turnover -
is Mr David Paresky, the chairman who since 1989 has owned 50 per cent of
Thomas Cook Travel. Mr Paresky and his wife now own 100 per cent of the
business. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Mr Maxwell bought Thomas Cook Travel in 1988, and a year later agreed to
link the business with Crimson Travel, Mr Paresky's company, with the pooled
operation trading under the Thomas Cook name.
Thomas Cook Travel, the third-largest US travel agency chain, employs 3,000
and has 500 offices across the US. It also has a relationship with the
worldwide Thomas Cook network.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: GFSA to sell assets of
lossmaking gold mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's largest mining
houses, yesterday announced that it planned to sell the assets of the
lossmaking Doornfontein gold mine, which is likely to cease production
within the year.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said that in spite of the mine's improved
performance during the December quarter, production was insufficient to
cover working costs at the current gold price.
Doornfontein reduced its loss to R5.87m (Dollars 1.9m) during the quarter,
from R17.34m during the previous three months.
The announcement was not unexpected, and forms part of a trend in the
industry to close marginal mines whose profitability has been squeezed by
the combination of rising costs and a stagnant gold price.
The weaker rand during the fourth quarter helped group profits, with GFSA's
four gold producers lifting after-tax profits to R270.2m from R226.8m during
the September quarter.
A 2.3 per cent fall in production to 30,661kg from 31,375kg, was more than
offset by a 3.6 per cent increase in the average gold price received.
This rose to R31,988 per kg from R30,865 per kg. The lower production was
largely attributable to disruption caused by underground fires at the Kloof,
Driefontein and Deelkraal mines.
Although working costs were virtually flat at R679.9m, compared with
R676.4m, working costs per kg gold produced rose by 3 per cent to R22,175
from R21,558, on account of the lower production. The average yield was 9
grams per tonne of ore milled against 9.1 grams.
After-tax profits at Driefontein, the group's largest producer, rose to
R137.4m from R115.7m.
Profits also rose at Kloof, the other large mine, to R125.2m from R115.3m.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Electric to pull out
of mainframe computer production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday confirmed
that it was planning to withdraw from mainframe computer production and
concentrate on smaller machines amid a continuing downturn in the domestic
computer industry.
A further sign of the severe conditions facing Japanese electronics
companies came with an announcement by Moody's Investors Service, the US
rating agency, that it has placed the long and short-term ratings of NEC
under review for possible downgrading.
Meanwhile, the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers said
yesterday industrial machinery orders fell 39.4 per cent in November,
compared to a year earlier, while consumer electronics sales over the first
10 months of 1992 were down 17 per cent.
Each of the announcements confirms the industry's fear that an expected
recovery will not come until late this year. Moody's said the review of NEC
follows 'concern that profitability, liquidity, and free cash flow may be
impaired over a longer period than previously expected due to severe
competition in its core businesses'.
Over the next few weeks, Japanese electronics manufacturers and other
leading industrial companies will review profit forecasts for the full-year
to March, as many had counted on an early upturn in domestic demand.
Mitsubishi reported a 73 per cent fall in first-half profits, NEC 71 per
cent, and Matsushita Electric Industrial 51 per cent.
However, demand is continuing to weaken. Production value of the mainframe
computers was down 21 per cent over the first 10 months of last year,
prompting Mitsubishi Electric to stop the development of new products,
leaving Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi the remaining Japanese makers.
'It would cost us more than Y100bn to maintain our mainframe development. We
didn't feel that we had gained sufficient market share to risk continuing in
that market,' Mitsubishi said yesterday.
The company is concentrating on computer systems between a workstation and
personal computer in size, trying to keep a distance from the heavy
discounting in the Japanese personal computer market. But Mitsubishi said
'our sector is difficult too'.
Mitsubishi's decision to streamline its product mix is typical of other
consumer and computer electronics makers.
Video camera sales fell 30 per cent in the first 10 months last year,
financial terminals 18 per cent, integrated circuit testers 38 per cent and
telecommunications equipment 7.5 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Toray bucks trend and expands
overseas - The Japanese textiles group sees room for more global growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic downturn has prompted a wave of Japanese companies to withdraw
from their overseas investments. Toray Industries, the large textile maker,
however, is bucking this trend and still expanding overseas.
'The real survival game has just started,' says Mr Hiroshi Maeda, managing
director. For Toray, overseas production of textiles is essential to hold
down prices to competitive levels. It is also investing in other sectors for
sales in overseas markets.
The company, which supplies Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, plans to
start production at its new Y15bn (Dollars 121m) textile plant in Mansfield
this year. In the US, Toray recently added a Dollars 100m manufacturing line
in its plastic film plant in Rhode Island, and last year started
construction of a plant in Seattle to supply Boeing with carbon fibre
resins.
The rush back to domestic markets by other Japanese companies is similar to
what happened in the recession of the mid-1970s. Although many Japanese
textile companies ventured overseas in the early 1970s, the recession
triggered by oil price rises prompted a quick change in plans. 'After the
oil shock, we were the only ones left in south-east Asia,' says Mr Maeda.
Diversification into non-textile products in the mid-1980s prompted Toray to
invest in Europe and North America as its customers, trying to minimise
inventories, demanded swift supplies. Meanwhile, in the textile sector,
Toray bought the polyester-filament weaving operations of Courtaulds, the UK
chemicals group, in 1989.
Toray expects overseas capital investment for the first six months to
September 1993 to rise 27 per cent to Y23bn and it hopes to maintain this
growth rate during 1994 and 1995.
Unlike electronics companies and carmakers, which rushed to increase
production capacity in the late 1980s, analysts point out that Toray's
investment decisions had little to do with the 'bubble boom' of the late
1980s. Its plans to increase overseas capacity were triggered by successful
sales of newly-developed synthetic fibres.
Ms Madoka Umetsu, analyst at brokerage UBS Phillips and Drew in Tokyo, said:
'Toray's domestic textile business was restructured in the 1980s after the
company was hit by the endaka - high yen - recession.'
The company's belief that fibres and textiles still comprise a growing
sector has given it the confidence to develop its innovations. In the late
1980s, annual textile consumption, including industrial use, per capita
totalled 27kg in the US, 19kg in the UK, 15.2kg in France, 9.3kg in Spain
and 5.4kg in China. The company believes the global textiles market still
has more room to grow.
The rising yen, high labour costs and growing competition from south-east
Asia, also provided the incentive for Toray to develop high value innovative
fibres and textiles, which have supported its profits.
In addition, the need for strong fibres which can withstand advanced high
speed weaving machines has lead to the development of microfibres.
Synthetic silks and other woven fabrics offer new creative possibilities for
leading Japanese and western fashion designers. Toray also supplies European
sports goods makers like Killy and Ellesse with its high-technology fibres
which are used to make moisture permeable waterproof fabrics.
However, Toray is not unscarred by the effects of Japan's 'bubble economy'.
Industrial textile sales have started to fall due to lower demand from the
Japanese automobile and electronics industries, while cheaper clothing
imports are entering the domestic market.
Losses at Toray Construction, a construction affiliate, are also depressing
the group's profits. Although Toray is faring better than other leading
Japanese textile manufacturers, it expects consolidated pre-tax profits to
fall 7 per cent to Y60bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,000bn, in the
year to March.
The company remains cautious over investments in Vietnam and eastern Europe,
however. It is still trying to assess the feasibility of setting up plants
in such areas. Mr Maeda said: 'Places like east Europe seem too unstable to
make large commitments.'
Toray needs to see steady returns on overseas investments before planning
further spending programmes which justify the fall in profits due to
increased borrowing costs. But, with the south-east Asian economies in good
shape and the US emerging from recession, the medium-term outlook is
favourable.
Toray is also hopeful of potential profits in high value applications of
high-technology textiles, in markets yet to be exploited.

THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) has once again crossed swords with
Magnum and Dunlop Estates, two listed Malaysian companies which are chasing
potentially highly-lucrative gaming projects in China.
The KLSE has directed each company to submit fortnightly progress reports on
the status of their proposed China ventures. Last September, Magnum and
Dunlop, both part of the Multi-Purpose Holdings group, had announced that
the authorities in China's Guangdong province had approved 'in principle'
the operation of a lottery by the two companies.
Subsequently, the KLSE insisted on more information. Magnum and Dunlop then
said that though Guangdong had approved their project, other 'relevant
authorities' had still to give their endorsement.

equity sell-off by banks

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has instructed banks not to sell stock market
securities as a means of shoring up profits ahead of the March 1993
year-end.
The ministry is reviving a directive, issued last August, when it announced
a package of measures aimed at restoring confidence in the banking system
and the stock market. These included guidelines for banks not to sell stocks
ahead of the half-year.
Despite brief euphoria over the crown prince's engagement last week, the
leading Nikkei stock index has fallen 2.3 per cent on meagre volume since
the new year, and investors are growing increasingly worried over a
potential sell-off as an increasing number of companies have started to
liquidate shareholdings ahead of March.
Corporations not under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry are selling
stocks in an attempt to prop up faltering profits in the current economic
downturn. Japanese companies sold a net Y210bn worth of stocks last month,
rising above the Y200bn level for the first time since October 1991.
Selling pressure is also expected to increase in March through a potential
Y650bn in unwinding of stocks bought on margin, and Y1,000bn in investment
trust redemptions.
Stock sales by companies may undermine efforts by financial authorities to
prevent a 'vicious circle' such as last year when the Nikkei average plunged
on stock selling by banks to realise profits on holdings. This eroded
unrealised gains on share investments, and created a further need to raise
profits by selling shares.
Aside from public money from postal savings and the national pension,
genuine buying interest seems to have dried up. Nikko Securities said the
market now hoped for buying by foreign investors, who in the past have been
leading buyers of Japanese shares.
The ministry's guidance is likely to prompt criticism from the country's
ailing brokers. One securities house official complained that additional
regulatory interference to help the banks could further undermine investors'
appetite for Japanese shares, which remain expensive at an average
price/earnings ratio of 52 times.
Last year's trading volume was the lowest since 1975, with activity
declining after the government implemented emergency measures to restore
investor confidence in August.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chrysler to raise Dollars 1.5bn
through global share offer

<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the financially-stretched US carmaker, last night announced plans
to bolster its balance sheet by raising nearly Dollars 1.5bn through an
international offering of 40m new shares.
The company will be taking advantage of its buoyant share price, which has
more than trebled since the start of 1992, thanks to a line of new products
which has won widespread praise.
Chrysler has 295m shares outstanding. They closed last night - before the
announcement of the offer - at Dollars 36 3/8 , up Dollars   3/8 , compared
with around Dollars 10 at the start of 1992.
Its last share issue was in the autumn of 1991 when it raised Dollars 354m
through a sale of 35m shares.
The company's ability to sell shares contrasts sharply with its position
three years ago, when many analysts questioned whether it could survive as
an independent company.
It has bounced back thanks to new products, a re-organisation of the way it
makes cars, a strenuous attack on costs, and disposals.
Chrysler said last night that the new shares were part of a plan to
strengthen its financial condition, increase its liquidity and add to its
equity base.
Analysts said that without new equity, the company had looked unlikely to
generate sufficient cash from operations during the current upswing in the
business cycle to meet two ambitions.
The first is to cut its unfunded pension liabilities, which stand at Dollars
4.4bn, by around Dollars 2bn. The other is to build up a Dollars 5bn cash
reserve which will enable it to keep funding its product development
programme.
The equity offer will also help the company's credit ratings, which have
been languishing in 'junk bond' status.
Moody's Investors Service last night raised Chrysler's senior notes to Ba2
from Single-B1.

THE US Department of Transportation has given its final approval to an
anti-trust immunity request from Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US
carrier, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the Dutch flagship carrier.
The Dutch airline already holds a minority share interest in the US airline
 -a move that could herald integration of the two carriers' operations.
The approval will provide the two airlines with immunity from anti-trust
suits as they link up operations.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Restructuring of O&amp;Y debt begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Olympia &amp; York have begun approving proposals which are likely
to lead to a gradual dismemberment of what was once the world's biggest
property developer.
Three of O&amp;Y's 33 creditor groups set the process in motion yesterday
morning, quickly passing debt restructuring plans for relatively minor
properties in Toronto and Ottawa partially owned by O&amp;Y. Three meetings were
adjourned to consider 'technical amendments'.
At five meetings later in the day, four groups approved plans , while a
fifth voted to adjourn until later this week. Another 22 meetings are
scheduled over the rest of the week. The meetings are being held behind
closed doors.
The proposals being voted on this week involve about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's
CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 10.5bn) debt. They do not include the Canary
Wharf project in London, which is in the hands of administrators, nor O&amp;Y's
US properties.
Negotiations are continuing separately with lenders to the US buildings, the
only part of the O&amp;Y empire which remains outside bankruptcy protection.
Under the proposals, creditors with loans secured by individual buildings
will generally be free to seize their collateral. O&amp;Y has already handed
over one Toronto building, the 45-storey Aetna Centre, to the mortgage
holder.
It is expected to lose control in coming months of several other properties,
including First Canadian Place, its 72-storey flagship in the heart of the
city's financial district.
Most of the remaining Canadian assets of O&amp;Y Developments, the present
holding company, will be transferred to a new management and leasing
company, called O&amp;Y Properties. In a circular to creditors, O&amp;Y last month
described O&amp;Y Properties as a 'viable, self-financing entity'.
Although the Reichmann family will continue to be represented on the boards
of directors of both companies, control will be in the hands of a
court-appointed administrator.
Loans secured by O&amp;Y's stakes in papermaker Abitibi-Price, energy producer
Gulf Canada Resources and property developer Trizec, will be serviced out of
available cash-flow from the pledged shares. These loans will be treated as
unsecured to the extent of any deficiency in debt-service payments.
Payments to unsecured creditors will ultimately depend on the course of the
North American real estate market and on O&amp;Y's ability to re-establish
itself.
A five-person 'monitoring committee', nominated by the unsecured creditors,
will be set up to safeguard their interests.

HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer group, is to invest Fl 30m (Dollars 16.5m)
in building production lines for laser printers at its European distribution
centre in Amersfoort, in the Netherlands.
When completed in March, the expanded facility will have two production
lines with a combined capacity of 80,000 printers per month. The site, which
is set to double in size to 20,000 square metres, may eventually house up to
five production lines, depending on demand.
HP has two other European printer production plants in Spain and Italy.
The printers assembled in the Netherlands are destined for customers and
resellers in Europe, where the market for laser printing is less mature than
in the US, opening up prospects of healthy growth in demand, HP said.
The Amersfoort production site will create up to 200 jobs over the next few
years.
The production lines will be operated by a subsidiary of Van Ommeren, the
Dutch shipping and storage group, which also runs HP's distribution centre.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro awaits the big
stick - The tough task facing the utility's new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MAURICE Strong, United Nations globe-trotter and organiser of the 1991
Earth Summit in Rio, has taken on what may prove to be one of his toughest
challenges.
The 63-year-old millionaire must get Ontario Hydro's costs under control,
cap its CDollars 36bn (USDollars 30bn) debt, and force power rates in
Canada's most populous province into line with the national consumer price
index.
Ontario Hydro, he says, is 'a corporation in crisis, and it is absolutely
critical that we get our fiscal house in order'.
Ontario Hydro, along with Hydro Quebec, are among North America's biggest
electric power utilities. They are controlled by their provincial
governments and each has total available capacity of about 30,000MW.
Ontario Hydro's biggest headache is the soaring costs of its nuclear
generating capacity - some of which has become surplus because of slow
economic growth.
Ontario Hydro, with assets of about CDollars 50bn, is more than half
nuclear-based. Its plants near Toronto are the showcase for the Canadian
heavy water-type reactor. But operating costs at its Pickering and Bruce
plants have proved much higher than expected.
A retubing programme now planned at Bruce would cost CDollars 2.5bn. Similar
work at Pickering burdened the budget proportionately during the 1980s.
But Ontario Hydro is now struggling with the Darlington nuclear plant,
originally estimated to cost CDollars 2bn for 4,000MW of installed capacity
in 1977, but now carrying a total cost of CDollars 14bn. Darlington was to
have been completed in 1988, but has contributed little to the Ontario grid.
The three-year recession and a severe shake-up in Ontario's manufacturing
industry have resulted in stagnant growth in demand for power. In the 1970s,
it was growing at an average of 7 per cent or more annually.
What incenses Ontario industry and consumers is a 30 per cent climb in power
rates in the past three years. The utilities' debt has now reached CDollars
36bn and rates, legally, must rise in step with debt.
Industrial users say the province has lost its comparative advantage of
cheap power, making it more difficult for them to compete with the US.
Consumers complain the rate rises are proof of the utility's inefficiency
and mistakes in forecasting demand.
Mr Strong, a westerner who made his first million in oil and gas, later
headed Power Corp of Canada, the Montreal conglomerate, and then set up
Petro-Canada, the national oil company, in the 1970s.
He was recently confirmed in his new job as Ontario Hydro chairman at
CDollars 425,000 a year, following Mr Marc Eliesen, who, appointed only 14
months ago by Ontario premier Mr Robert Rae, only had time to make a start
on cutbacks.
Mr Strong has confirmed his predecessor's cuts of up to CDollars 10bn in the
utility's 10-year capital spending, About 2,000 will be cut from Ontario
Hydro's payroll and retirement offers made to several thousand of its 28,000
workforce.
A CDollars 13bn multi-year power purchase agreement with Manitoba has been
terminated, requiring a penalty estimated at between CDollars 150m and
CDollars 300m. A complete hydro electric project in Manitoba has now been
delayed indefinitely. Critics charge that Ontario Hydro is in a 'death
spiral' and threatens the province's whole economy.
'All through the post-war growth period, people thought Ontario Hydro could
do no wrong,' said Mr Tony O'Donohue, director of the Toronto Hydro
Commission, the utility's biggest single customer. 'But that was before
these double-digit rate increases. Municipalities are forced to consider
other sources or even producing their own power.'
Some argue the only effective way to avoid disaster would be to break up and
sell the utility. But the nuclear generating side would remain a millstone
around the province's neck because it can never make a private-sector rate
of return. And the distribution grid would remain provincially owned.
Asked whether Mr Rae would allow him to wield the big stick, he replied: 'I
can't do it alone, but Ontario Hydro is saveable. In a few years we'll be
looking back to 1992-3 as a key transition point.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banesto sells corporate loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Espanol de Credito (Banesto) yesterday became the first bank in
continental Europe to remove corporate loans from its balance sheet through
securitisation.
Securitisation allows banks or companies to repackage assets and sell them
to investors, thus removing these assets from their balance sheets for
accounting purposes, and, in the case of banks, reducing the amount of
capital they need to hold.
This is the latest innovative financing used by Spanish banks to raise new
capital, following a series of preferred share offerings and subordinated
debt placements.
Banesto has set up a Dollars 1bn Euro-commercial paper programme, backed by
loans to Spanish companies. The first Dollars 30m tranche of one-month
commercial paper, backed by a three-year loan, was issued under the
programme yesterday. As the commercial paper matures, more paper is issued
throughout the life of the underlying loan. In case no investor can be found
for the new paper, a liquidity facility is provided by JP Morgan, the
arranger of the programme.
According to JP Morgan, the structure allows Banesto to fund the loans at a
cost below the London interbank offered rate, which is cheaper than their
normal cost of funds.
Loans to companies are considered the most difficult assets to securitise.
Because of their large size, risk is much more concentrated than in the
securitisation of, for example, mortgages. Unlike consumer loans, they are
individually negotiated transactions.
A number of UK banks, which have been experiencing difficulties in the
corporate loan market during the recession, have been eyeing the structure.

manufacturing operations

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TANDY, one of the largest US consumer electronics retailers and
manufacturers, is to split into two independent companies by spinning off
its manufacturing operations.
The new manufacturing unit, to be called TE Electronics, will produce
personal computers, audio equipment, office furniture and other consumer
products. It will be publicly traded.
Tandy, meanwhile, will continue operating its chain of 7,000 Radio Shack
consumer electronics stores as well as expanding its Computer City and
Incredible Universe superstores.
The company said about 100 of its 413 McDuff's and VideoConcepts specialty
stores in the US that are unprofitable would be closed.
'The proposed separation of retail businesses from our manufacturing
business will permit Tandy to focus on retailing and its new retail concepts
and broaden its product line,' said Mr John Roach, Tandy chief executive.
For the year ended June 30, Tandy recorded earnings of Dollars 184m on
revenues of Dollars 4.68bn. The previous year, the company earned Dollars
195m on Dollars 4.56bn in revenue.
TE Electronics will include all 25 of Tandy's manufacturing operations world
wide. In fiscal 1992, the combined sales of these units as a separate
company would have been about Dollars 1.5bn. TE Electronics expects to take
a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m related to the spin-off.
The sales of Tandy's retailing operations during calendar year 1992 were
approximately Dollars 3.8bn, the company said. Tandy's US retail sales for
the month of December were Dollars 604.6m, a 7 per cent increase over the
same month last year.
Tandy will take a Dollars 47.5m charge for restructuring its retail
operations, including the closure of 100 unprofitable specialty stores. Mr
Roach said most of Tandy's 6,300 employees would not be affected by the
restructuring.
Tandy stockholders will receive shares of TE in the form of a tax-free
dividend, pending approval by the company's board of directors and the
Internal Revenue Service.
Tandy said yesterday it had agreed to resolve all outstanding litigation
between itself and Texas Instruments.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Saudi prince buys stake in Saks
store group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SAUDI prince who acquired a sizeable minority stake in Citicorp two years
ago has become a large investor in Saks Fifth Avenue, the US department
store group which was bought by Investcorp, an Arab-led investment
consortium in 1989.
Investcorp said yesterday that United Saudi Commercial Bank had arranged for
some of its Saudi clients to buy a stake of approximately 11 per cent in the
retail group, for Dollars 100m. The principal investor in the transaction
was said to be Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, United
Saudi's chairman.
Prince Alwaleed became chairman of the Saudi bank after he bought a
controlling interest in 1987. But he is probably best known for his stake in
Citicorp, the largest US commercial bank.
The prince surfaced as an investor in the US bank in early 1991 when he
snapped up Dollars 590m-worth of convertible stock, one of the largest
placements of stock with a private individual in the history of US banking.
However, he was already a large ordinary shareholder in the bank, and is now
reckoned to have invested about Dollars 800m in Citicorp's preferred and
ordinary shares.
United Saudi Commercial Bank said yesterday that the Dollars 100m investment
did not represent new money for Saks, but the placement of a portion of an
additional Dollars 300m investment which Investcorp made in Saks last year.
Investcorp, which acquired Saks from Britain's BAT Industries for Dollars
1.6bn, disclosed the Dollars 300m injection last February.
Although the capital infusion came at a time when adverse rumours about the
condition of Saks' finances were circulating, Saks maintained that it was
essentially a refinancing, designed to help the retailer shed its highly
leveraged transaction status, and borrow funds more easily and cheaply.

FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sandoz awakens from slumber to
rejoin global chemical leaders - The group is closing the gap with its
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION the name Sandoz, and those who recognise it are likely to remember
the large escape in 1986 of toxic chemicals into the Rhine at Basle.
The pharmaceutical and chemicals group was responsible for that ecological
disaster, and its directors remain deeply scarred by the experience.
However, Sandoz, formerly known as the slowest and most inward-looking of
the big three Swiss pharmaceutical groups, is suddenly beginning to look
like one of the more dynamic international players.
In the past decade, it has slashed large sales and profit gaps with its
Basle neighbours, Ciba-Geigy and Roche, and put together an impressive
portfolio of innovative drugs.
Its biggest-selling product, Sandimmun, or cyclosporin A, is the drug of
choice to suppress immune reactions to transplanted organs; its Clozaril, or
clozapine, has achieved success in treating schizophrenics. Analysts agree
that it has an impressive list of new products in the pipeline.
Sandoz, the world's eighth-largest pharmaceutical group, is at the forefront
of the new trend to tie up with leading edge research institutes and
companies to sharpen their research efforts.
Last month, it announced a collaboration with Scripps Research Institute, a
leading US medical research organisation, under which it would spend more
than Dollars 300m over 10 years on jointly-agreed projects. In 1991, it
splashed out Dollars 392m for a 60 per cent stake in a biotechnology
start-up company in California, and another Dollars 100m for a research
tie-up with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
To top things off, it is deliberately moving away from its Swiss base. 'We
are, of course, a Swiss multinational, but we are above all citizens of the
world,' Mr Marc Moret, the group's 69-year-old chairman said in an
interview. 'We have 4 per cent of our sales in Switzerland, 96 per cent
abroad. That is a good mirror of our priorities.'
Mr Moret, a craggy, shy Swiss industrialist with a reputation for being
autocratic, is the man most identified with these transformations, and he
does not suffer from false modesty about it.
The turning point was when he was promoted from finance director to chief
executive in 1981.
Even though the group was healthy, he demanded the authority to cut out fat.
'This was not a common thing to do in continental Europe at that time. But
it was the beginning of a phase of rapid expansion, and you can see the
results.'
A more radical shake-up two years ago put all the main Sandoz divisions into
incorporated subsidiaries. The idea was not only to decentralise
responsibility but also to make it easier to divest a laggard division if an
opportunity arose.
'We now say to the division heads, 'You are part of this Sandoz club. You
must prove that you have the people, the organisation and the results that
make you worthy of continuing among Sandoz activities',' Mr Moret says.
Sandoz long lagged behind its neighbours in moving production out of Basle
and in appealing to foreign managers and investors.
Until recently, more than 90 per cent of its chemicals for drugs were made
in the city. Its goal is to bring that down to 50 per cent as soon as
possible.
And the first non-Swiss has just been appointed to the group managing board.
'In the group management, we have too few foreigners. The difficulty is
language. We speak German and sometimes French.
'Thank God, more and more British - more British than Americans - are
beginning to take up languages.'
The group no longer restricts foreign ownership of its shares. 'We cannot on
the one hand be multinational and on the other remain little egotistical and
jealous Swiss,' Mr Moret says. Foreign ownership has soared to more than
one-third in the past two years.
But probably the most important changes are in the group's research and
development policy. Whereas the entire R&amp;D effort used to be carried out
in-house in Basle, the group has recently set up several centres outside
Switzerland and formed alliances with external research institutes, such as
Scripps.
These deals are aimed at getting closer to the leading edge of technologies
than is likely in-house. 'We multiply the potential for success by a
considerable margin,' Mr Moret believes.
He does not deny that the company gives up some control by handing fistfuls
of money to thrusting young scientists, although the amounts are still
modest relative to its SFr1.4bn (Dollars 0.97bn) annual R&amp;D budget. 'Perhaps
we lose in precise and efficient management, but it is more important to let
some researchers have their freedom,' he says.
He cites the discovery and development of Sandimmun, a story book tale of a
Sandoz scientist, Jean-Francois Borel, toiling in an almost clandestine way
in the mid-1970s after the company had officially given up immunology
research. The product now accounts for about one-third of Sandoz
pharmaceutical revenues.
Other big pharmaceutical companies are following the same route. Roche two
years ago bought a 60 per cent stake in the US biotechnology group,
Genentech, and in 1991 Glaxo, the leading UK pharmaceutical group, set up a
joint research programme into diabetes and obesity treatment with Amylin, a
California biotechnology company.
'It is an increasing trend in the industry,' says Mr Peter Smith, a
pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers James Capel in London.
'It is like a day at the races. You back a number of 10 to one shots, and
probably one of them is going to come in.'
It is thus a strategy that lessens the risk of being left without any good
new products coming to market, although if that did happen, Sandoz has the
financial power for a larger acquisition.
Mr Moret said last year that he could put together 'a few billion Swiss
francs' in a hurry if he wanted to.
'Who says we will not do a big thing some day,' he said in the interview.
There was no urgent need, but things moved quickly in the pharmaceutical
field these days. 'Scripps was not on the programme nine months ago,' he
said.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Failure to act on surplus distorts
companies' behaviour - Advance corporation tax is threatening the UK's use
as a multinational base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCE corporation tax has not been popular with companies since its
introduction in 1973. But the problem of unrelieved ACT is now posing a
threat to the UK being used as a base for multinational companies, whether
originating in Britain or abroad, and deterring UK companies from investing
overseas.
With 40 per cent of the earnings of quoted companies coming from abroad, the
tax, which effectively penalises the payment of dividends out of non-UK
profits, is a serious issue for the stock market. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and
sweeteners group, said recently, 'as it stands, this tax acts as a deterrent
to overseas investment'.
Companies are being required to overpay tax, in the form of ACT, to the tune
of Pounds 500m a year. And the total of surplus ACT which had piled up is
now approaching Pounds 6bn, according to some estimates.
There is concern that higher tax rates caused by surplus ACT which reduce
earnings, and hence share prices, is making it more expensive for them to
raise equity capital needed to finance their way out of recession.
Such is the concern at the Department of Trade and Industry about the loss
of competitiveness the ACT problem is creating that Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the Board of Trade, has lent his support to lobby groups which
are tackling the Treasury on this ticklish subject.
Representatives of the 100 Group, formed by the finance directors of 100 top
companies, have had discussions with Mr Heseltine. He promised the DTI would
support them in finding proposals acceptable to the Treasury, which would at
least partially relieve the surplus ACT liability.
But there appears to be a split between the DTI and the Treasury.
Although Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, mentioned the
question of surplus ACT in the budget, the government's current shortage of
funds appears to have pushed the topic down the agenda again.
One finance director said: 'All the signals from government are that they
cannot give any hand-outs whatsoever. They have said they are prepared to
listen to recommendations from industry on surplus ACT provided they are tax
neutral in corporation tax terms. They put in that proviso to show willing
but give absolutely no help.'
One academic remarked: 'The way the revenue has managed to introduce the
neutrality of a proposal as a prerequisite for consideration is scandalous'.
Meanwhile, the Inland Revenue is becoming more zealous in its attempts to
stop companies trying to get round the tax, for instance by acquiring other
companies with a record of mainstream corporation tax payments against which
they can offset ACT.
ACT is a method by which the Inland Revenue passes to companies the
responsibility of collecting basic rate income tax on dividends. When a
company pays a dividend it must pay the basic rate income tax due to the
taxman.
If the recipient of the dividend is a non-taxpayer, such as a pension fund,
it can then reclaim the tax. When the company comes to pay its UK
corporation tax it can deduct the ACT paid from the bill. The ACT cannot be
offset against corporation tax paid in other countries.
The system works well so long as the company's UK corporation tax bill is
greater than the amount of ACT it has paid. If it is not the company has to
pay the ACT and the corporation tax. As Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, who
writes on ACT for the Adam Smith Institute, said: 'In certain circumstances
ACT is not an advance tax but a final tax.' In effect some companies are
being penalised by paying a higher rate of tax than other companies.
Those with a large proportion of profits from non-UK sources and a dividend
in line with normal UK pay-out ratios, are unlikely to have sufficient UK
corporation tax to mop up the ACT liability. Companies paying uncovered
dividends are also hit.
Surplus ACT is partly a cyclical problem as the recession hits UK profits.
But it is increasingly regarded as structural as more companies develop
international businesses.
Many industrialists and academics believe ACT is having a distorting effect
on how companies behave, which, they say, is bad for corporate UK.
While few will admit to doing anything solely for tax purposes, a survey by
the London Business School found that of companies with a surplus ACT
problem, a third said it influenced their dividend payments, and three
quarters said it was a factor in deciding where to borrow. More than half
admitted it influenced decisions on investing abroad and a quarter that it
affected the location of research and development.
These corporate consequences of the tax system can be detrimental to the UK
economy, leading to the loss of jobs and business opportunities in the UK,
and driving skills overseas. As for the incentive to make acquisitions, Mr
Bracewell-Milnes said that having 'a built-in fiscal incentive for acquiring
other companies is not a good way to run an economy'.
The DTI is not just concerned about UK companies, though. The ACT regime is
such that it can deter foreign groups setting up a holding company in the
UK.
Take a US company wishing to group its European businesses under one holding
company. Profits from the subsidiaries in each country would be passed to
the UK group, which would then pay them to its US parent in the form of a
dividend. The UK holding company would have to pay ACT on the dividend, but
would be unlikely to have paid enough UK corporation tax to offset that ACT.
Such a company could find a much more sympathetic tax regime in the
Netherlands or Belgium, for example.
The loss of such companies from the UK has an adverse effect on providers of
services such as banks, accountants and lawyers.
There are almost as many proposed solutions to the question of surplus ACT
as there are companies troubled by it, ranging from doing nothing to
overhauling the entire tax system. However, most ideas would involve a loss
of revenue for the government or an increase in tax for the shareholders.
The government might simply choose to address the holding company issue,
perhaps by creating 'international holding company' status and giving that
category exemption from ACT. But this would cause an outcry among the many
UK-owned groups facing the same problem.
At present some companies such as Unilever and Shell with dual corporate
status pay ACT only on the dividends paid on the UK shares.
Mr Roger Wood, finance director of Wimpey, the construction group, is
chairman of the 100 Group's working party on surplus ACT, which has put
forward three other proposals.
He said it had suggested a change in the rules to allow a pound-for-pound
offset of ACT against corporation tax. The difference in basic income tax
rate and corporation tax rate means that a company must pay Pounds 33 of
corporation tax to offset Pounds 25 of ACT. If there was a pound-for-pound
offset it would only need Pounds 25 of corporation tax. This appears to be
the most likely idea to find government acceptance in the short term.
He also said that companies should be allowed to pay ACT on only a
proportion of their dividends. For instance dividends paid out of foreign
profits would be paid free of ACT. The Inland Revenue would then have to
collect tax on the remaining percentage.
Offsetting ACT against overseas tax would give the Treasury a problem as
shareholders which do not pay tax would be able to reclaim tax although the
Treasury had not received it. It would take new tax treaties with other
countries to solve the problem.
The Ruding Committee, which reported earlier this year, suggested that
within the EC it should be possible to offset ACT, and its variants in other
countries, against corporation tax paid anywhere within the community.
However, the committee's recommendations are not expected to come into force
in the foreseeable future.
The 100 Group's third suggestion is that the market in companies with spare
ACT capacity should be allowed to flourish, in the same way that tax losses
can be bought and sold.
Other lobbyists go further and argue for a fundamental reform of the UK
corporation tax system, going back to the pre-1973 arrangements or even to
before the introduction of corporation tax itself in 1965.
Hopes of radical change are unlikely to be realised. If the government does
agree to reform the system at all, it is more likely to be a matter of
tinkering. However, if companies are given a way to offset ACT written off
in previous years they may enjoy low tax rates, and thus higher earnings,
for some years to come.

How ACT works: Companies pay the basic rate of income tax on the gross
dividend to the Exchequer - In the example above a gross dividend of
pounds 33.3 million yields ACT of pounds 8.3 million and a net dividend
of 25 million. The company can then offset ACT against its mainstream UK
corporation tax charge, as companies A and B do.
But ACT cannot be offset on a pound-for-pound basis because of the
difference between corporation tax and basic income tax rates.
Companies must pay pounds 33 of corporation tax to relieve pounds 25 of
ACT. Thus company C is unable to relieve part of its ACT bill. Company D
is unable to offset any.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: How companies can relieve the problem of a
substantial tax burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES CAN boost UK profits to furnish more corporation tax to relieve
the ACT by moving costs - such as R&amp;D and borrowings - abroad, while
bringing more revenue to the UK.
Pilkington, the international glass group which shoulders a substantial
burden of ACT, decided last year to move its R&amp;D facility to Brussels. The
group's ACT problem cannot but have been a consideration.
Most companies offer shareholders the choice of taking dividends in shares
rather than cash, as ACT is not payable on scrip dividends. But they are
unattractive to tax-free institutional investors who cannot reclaim the tax
credit, and generally have a low take-up rate.
Some companies have gone to the extent of making acquisitions in order to
buy capacity to relieve ACT. This can be a by-product of a normal
acquisition, but there are schemes which appear to be simply moves to avoid
tax.
The purchasers are naturally reluctant to discuss such schemes - one finance
director when asked if his company had employed one said: 'Let's just say I
am familiar with how they work'.
The sellers are also secretive. One said: 'It does no one any good to have
these things talked about'.
Recent sellers include Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathroom group which
sold four subsidiaries with net asset values totalling Pounds 1.6m for up to
Pounds 11.3m.
In May, Farnell Electronics, the electrical components distributor, sold a
subsidiary with net assets of Pounds 6.2m for Pounds 12.7m.
The unofficial market in subsidiaries, organised by tax consultants, allows
companies with a subsidiary which has paid corporation tax over the previous
six years in excess of its own ACT requirements to strip the subsidiary of
its trading activities and sell it.
The buyer then passes dividends through the subsidiary and offsets the ACT
on those dividends against the corporation tax paid by its former own-ers.
The Inland Revenue is understood to be looking at such schemes carefully,
and may apply Sections 703 and 704 of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes
Act - which require that there is a genuine commercial reason for the
transaction.
One finance director of a large, international public company, says: 'We
receive suggestions on ACT regularly and look at them carefully. We discard
98-99 per cent of them either because they are inappropriate or of doubtful
legality.
'The key is whether you can genuinely say there is a valid reason for the
transaction other than avoidance of tax, otherwise the Inland Revenue will
challenge it. We have done one or two which the Inland Revenue will
challenge but we believe we can say there is a genuine commercial reason.'

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hadleigh reduces deficit to Pounds 0.36m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The implementation of a cost savings package enabled Hadleigh Industries,
the USM-quoted specialist supplier of transport and storage products and
services, to reduce losses from Pounds 535,000 to Pounds 357,000 pre-tax for
the half year to September 30.
The group has been trading profitably since the period end and its forward
order book is 'healthier' than for some time. Directors believe this will
lead to a 'significant' improvement in the second half.
First half sales amounted to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 14m). The pre-tax figure
was struck after taking account of interest charges of Pounds 366,000
(Pounds 296,000) and exceptional provisions of Pounds 98,000 (Pounds
288,000).
Losses per share emerged at 3.3p (4.87p) and the interim dividend is omitted
 -1.25p was paid previously but the final was passed. At September 30
gearing stood at 83 per cent (74 per cent).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MITIE Group, the Greenock-based building services company, made strong
headway at the interim stage despite what Mr David Telling, chairman,
described as 'even more difficult conditions than last year'. On turnover
ahead 60 per cent to Pounds 35.6m, pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 30 amounted to Pounds 943,000 - a rise of 30 per cent on the
comparable Pounds 726,000.
Earnings per share, however, expanded by a more modest 12 per cent to 5.7p
(5.1p) reflecting a 36 per cent tax charge, up from 33.5 per cent, and
increased minority interests. The interim dividend goes up from 1.25p to
1.5p.

Cannon Street Investments is withdrawing from the double glazing segment of
its operations.
For the year to December 31 1991 these activities incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 3.3m. The directors believe that losses from this source for the 12
months to January 3 1993 will be 'significantly' higher than 1991's.
Olivers Windows, the group's principal double glazing business, is calling
for the appointment of a liquidator and the boards of the other double

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Treatt, the USM-quoted supplier, blender and distiller of
essential oils and aromatic chemicals, showed an 8 per cent advance, from
Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.27m, in the year to end-September.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 15.1m.
Earnings per share rose to 9.37p (8.53p) and an improved final dividend of
2.6p is proposed, making 3.6p (3.4p).
Mr Geoffrey Bovill, chairman, said the result included a Pounds 107,000 loss
at Florida Treatt, the US offshoot. That was disappointing, but represented
a 52 per cent improvement.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum receives unwelcome
approach from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLES have been turned on Aberdeen Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and
gas group, which yesterday became the focus of a surprise announcement of an
unwelcome approach from a US company. This follows last month's announcement
of its merger proposals with Brabant Resources, which were rejected.
Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached
the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen
shares for each of its own.
Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's
share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10
3/4 p.
Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made
in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the
approach had first been made.
He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate
North American assets.
If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM
quotation.
Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on
Nasdaq in the US.
It has a market value of about Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per
cent held by three UK institutions and Torchmark, the US insurance company.
The Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the
tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: EIO close to victory in bid for St Andrews
Trust
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECCLESIASTICAL Insurance Office is close to victory in its bid for St Andrew
Trust, the smaller companies' investment trust, despite institutional
opposition to the offer.
At the first closing date last Friday, EIO had acceptances of 7.8 per cent.
Together with its existing stake of 40.27 per cent, that lifts its interest
to 48.07 per cent.
The bid is technical, designed to give EIO a 50 per cent plus stake in St
Andrew so that it can equity account the holding for EC capital adequacy
purposes.
However, institutions such as British American Film Holdings have argued
that the offer, at 93 per cent of formula asset value, does not pay a
sufficient premium for control. 'If EIO wins control, it won't have the same
interest as the rest of the shareholders,' argued Mr Jonathan Woolf of BAFH.
Mr George Prescott of EIO said yesterday: 'We've been associated with the
trust for a number of years. We believe we've always taken the interests of
all shareholders into account.'
The offer has been extended until January 22.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Savings help AG Barr advance 80%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST SAVINGS derived from the 1991 restructuring of its production and
distribution helped AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company whose
brands include Irn-Bru and Tizer, to lift pre-tax profits 80 per cent to
Pounds 5.97m in the 53 weeks to October 31.
The result, up from a restated Pounds 3.31m for the previous 52 weeks -
where the extraordinary restructuring costs were brought above the line -
was struck on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 94.7m (Pounds 90m), though
this translated into a 3 per cent rise when adjusted for the extra week.
The pre-tax line was also helped by the reduction of interest charges from
Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 1.07m - borrowings fell by Pounds 3.75m over the
year, according to Mr Robin Barr, chairman. There was also a Pounds 409,000
gain from the sale of the stake in Taveners, the sugar confectionery maker.
With operating profits up 17 per cent at Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 5.66m), Mr
Barr said it had been 'a strong year' for the company, adding that in a
static soft drinks market Barr brands had outperformed competitors, and this
in a year of recession when the weather had been unseasonal in the
traditionally strong-selling months of August and September.
In Scotland, Irn-Bru commands 18 per cent of the branded market, against
Coca Cola which has 25 per cent and Pepsi 8 per cent. In the other flavours
segment of the UK carbonates market, it has an 8 per cent share, behind
Tango with 12 per cent. Tizer, which Mr Barr said was returning to TV
advertising after a three-year absence, has 2.5 per cent.
Mr Barr warned that the first two months of the current year had been
affected by price cutting on commodity flavours and that sugar prices had
risen 16 per cent between September 1992 and January 1993 because of the
fall in the value of the green pound. He reckoned this would result in price
increases on brands of about 6 per cent, rather than the 2 per cent planned
two months before Black Wednesday.
Earnings grew to 21.67p (12.2p) per share and the final dividend is lifted
to 4.75p (4.3767p) to make 6.5p (5.46p) for the year, a rise of 19 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard slips 13% to Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELLIS &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, announced a 13 per cent fall in
interim profits as recession continued to affect its main markets in the UK
and US.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 6.5m in the six months to
October 31, in line with market expectations. Mr Peter Wood, chief
executive, said business remained difficult and chemical prices had
continued to slip in the US. 'But we've held our own in our major markets,'
he said.
Turnover fell from Pounds 198m to Pounds 190.1m reflecting disposals and
lower average dollar exchange rates. US sales increased 8 per cent in volume
terms but after the effects of price decreases and sterling conversion, the
US contribution was 4 per cent lower.
The UK performed well and recorded volume gains and slight price increases,
Mr Wood said. But the swimming pool chemicals division, which made a
promising start to the period, tailed off badly and saw profits dive to
about Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 700,000). Preymer, the company's 70 per
cent-owned Spanish subsidiary, remained in the red.
Rationalisation in the swimming pools division cost about Pounds 150,000. Mr
Michael Marshall, the former executive chairman who resigned in July,
received compensation of Pounds 350,000. Mr Wood said the company hoped to
announce a replacement for Mr Marshall before releasing full year results in
July.
Net borrowings almost doubled to Pounds 18m, taking gearing to 27 per cent
compared to 14.3 per cent at the year end. The increase was due to currency
translation changes and seasonal factors; interest costs fell to Pounds
700,000 (Pounds 1m) due to lower borrowing levels.
Earnings fell to 5.5p (6.7p) per share. The interim dividend is maintained
at 2.25p.
COMMENT
Times remain tough for Ellis &amp; Everard and, despite a glimmer of hope in the
US, it is difficult to see much recovery flowing through to the results
until well into next financial year. Meanwhile, the swimming pools and
European operations remain disappointing, especially after the company
highlighted pools' strong performance last year. This suggests full year
profits will remain flat with analysts pencilling in Pounds 12.5m. Despite
yesterday's 7p fall to 188p, the shares are on an expensive multiple of 18.
After a strong run since November - along with other second line chemicals
companies - the market may need further signs of recovery before allowing
the shares to go higher.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tables turned as Aberdeen Petroleum becomes
the subject of an unwelcome US approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLES have been turned on Aberdeen Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and
gas group, which yesterday became the focus of a surprise announcement of an
unwelcome approach from a US company.
Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached
the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen
shares for each of its own.
Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's
share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10
3/4 p. The shares last night closed  1/8 p higher at 8 5/8p.
Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made
in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the
approach had first been made.
He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate
North American assets.
If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM
quotation.
Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on
Nasdaq in the US. It has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 11.5m
(Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per cent held by three UK institutions and
Torchmark, the US insurance company.
It is extremely unlikely, however, that Aberdeen would accept the initial
proposals from Bellwether.
Both companies have been in informal discussions for more than a year, said
one observer close to Aberdeen.
Yet the Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the
tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings.
The irony of yesterday's announcement was not lost on Aberdeen, which last
month received short shrift from Brabant Resources, another USM-quoted
company, to its own surprise merger proposals.
Last week Brabant issued a strong statement stressing that Aberdeen's plan
did not have the support of the board.
Brabant said its North Sea assets and focus on exploration did not fit with
Aberdeen's largely American base.
Mr George Robb, the new chairman of Aberdeen, said his company was meeting
with financial advisers to determine an appropriate response.
The announcement would not alter the situation with Brabant, he added.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke to open 70 shops in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE RACING, part of the hotel, DIY, property development and betting
group, said yesterday that it plans to open at least 70 off-track betting
shops in Argentina over the next five years.
The move, which represents another indication of the improving commercial
links between Argentina and Britain highlighted by the visit last week to
Buenos Aires by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, could provide the
group with an important entry into Argentina's lucrative betting business.
Ladbroke has reached an agreement with Hipodromo Argentino de Palermo which
runs the Palermo racecourse in the heart of Buenos Aries close to the River
Plate - one of the country's two premier race tracks. Racing is held at
Palermo three times a week throughout the year.
Under the agreement, the group has acquired exclusive rights throughout
Argentina for the distribution and marketing of Palermo's pari-mutuel
(tote-style) betting to both the existing small number of off-track betting
shops and its own facilities.
Racing is extremely popular in Argentina but the betting industry is
relatively undeveloped. Currently there are just 34 off-track betting shops,
but the biggest of these take about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in bets each
week.
Mr Peter George, Ladbroke's joint managing director, said: 'Our racing
operations have been following the situation in Argentina closely for two
years. Horse racing and betting occupy a prominent and well-established
place in the country's leisure industry and we are delighted to have gained
the opportunity to be the leading off-track betting operator in the
country.'

in San Francisco refiner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
British Sugar, the beet processing and marketing division of Associated
British Foods, has called off talks to buy a stake in a San Francisco-based
cane sugar refiner.
The discussions with Californian and Hawaiian Sugar Refinery, which were
disclosed in March last year, appear to have failed over the price British
Sugar was prepared to pay.
C&amp;H is a co-operative owned by the Hawaiian cane sugar growers who send
their raw cane to the refinery for processing and distribution. It is the
leading brand of sugar in the west of the US.
However, C&amp;H's co-operative status meant that all the growers had to agree
the deal and this seems to have proved impossible.
C&amp;H would have been British Sugar's first non-UK investment apart from two
factories it owns in Poland.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Regional press tipped as growth industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DETAILED analysis of the UK regional press predicts strong growth in the
sector once economic recovery gets under way.
Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon,
recommends no less than 12 regional publishing groups as either buys or
holds. Five of the com-panies are picked as buys for both the short-term and
the long-term.
The five companies are: Johnston Press, the Scottish local newspaper group
which has expanded into England; Southern Newspapers, pub-lishers of the
Southern Evening Echo in Southampton; The Daily Mail and General Trust,
owners of the Northcliffe group of regional newspapers; Reed International,
owners of Reed Regional Newspapers; and United Newspapers, owners of United
Provincial News-papers.
Mr de Bellaigue, in his last publishing study before his retirement, says
investors should look at the regional press because 'it is a classic
recovery sector with 70 per cent of revenues coming from advertising.'
Apart from high operational gearing, which means that higher advertising
revenue converts mainly into profits, regional papers have strong
cash-generating properties and have 'the enviable margins' of companies
dominating their markets.
Panmure Gordon does however issue a health warning in the shape of the
danger that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, might impose
value added tax on newspapers and books.
Mr de Bellaigue argues that regional newspapers will inevitably face
increased com-petition from the electronic media.
The longer term strengths of the industry include the conservatism of many
of its customers and the scope for further improvement of margins.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Trencherwood agrees refinancing package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRENCHERWOOD, a USM-quoted housebuilder and property company, yesterday
announced a refinancing package under which Pounds 35m of bank debts and
claims have been swapped to ordinary and preference shares.
The proposals will dilute existing shareholdings to 30 per cent of the
enlarged capital. They will be further diluted to 15.9 per cent if the
conversion of the preference shares takes place in full.
The restructuring agreement involved 10 banks and building societies. The
main lenders to the parent company were Midland Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland
and Schroders, who have taken the preference shares. The project lenders,
which accounted for about Pounds 14m of debts, received ordinary shares.
Midland will be issued with 16.25m new preference shares in exchange for
releasing the company from its guarantees of Notiondial, a business park
subsidiary which will be sold for a nominal sum.
The banks also agreed to provide five-year term facilities of Pounds 22.4m,
overdraft and engagement facilities of Pounds 7m and a standby facility of
Pounds 1m.
On November 30, the company had net debts including claims and bonds of
Pounds 25m and net assets of Pounds 7m.
Mr Richard Brooke, finance director of Trencherwood, said the company had
prepared a five year business plan which had won the support of its banks.
'The banks have been very supportive towards the company.' he said.
The refinancing arrangements depend on shareholders' approval, which will be
sought at an extraordinary meeting.
In the half year to April 1992, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 16.4m after exceptional items compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.3m
the previous year. At that date, the group had a deficiency of net assets of
Pounds 29m.
Losses per share were 65.6p, compared with 9.3p the previous year.

Newton, the fund management group, has bought out the 35 per cent stake
previously held in it by Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, the US insurance
broking and management consultancy company.
The company was founded in 1977 as a joint venture between Mr Stewart Newton
and Stenhouse, which was acquired by Alexander &amp; Alexander in the 1980s.
Management acquired 65 per cent of Newton in a buy-out in 1986.
Newton is also acquiring the management of Stenhouse Exempt Fund and
Stenhouse Exempt Gilt Fund from A&amp;A. These pooled pension funds have more
than Pounds 530m under management. Newton had previously been investment
manager but will now take over functions such as administration and
marketing.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carclo advances 28% as order book improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering Group, the Leeds-based card clothing, wire and
engineering products group, yesterday announced a 28 per cent increase in
profits and earnings and stronger order intake in the past three months.
Interim pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 3.68m in the six
months to end-September on sales up 5 per cent at Pounds 40.7m.
Earnings per share jumped from 4.9p to 6.3p and the interim dividend is
increased by 5 per cent to 1.8p.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the group was expanding its wire division and
was moving the card clothing operation.
The group finished the period with Pounds 3m of net cash, a position which
is likely to prevail at the end of the year.
The core card clothing division - which grew from the traditional family-run
wool-carding industry in Yorkshire in the last century - increased profits
by 46 per cent. On sales of Pounds 9.8m boosted by an acquisition in
Belgium, operating profits rose to Pounds 1.5m. Part of the increase
followed a greater level of sales to OEM manufacturers which bought very
little in the same period in 1991.
Mr Ewart said this relatively inexpensive product had a high gross margin;
any increases in sales fed quickly through to the bottom line.
Profitability in the wire division jumped by 78 per cent to Pounds 800,000
from a low base. In particular Joseph Sykes Brothers, which makes
nylon-covered wire for products like the bindings of notebooks and
paper-clips, remained a strongly growing market.
Carclo has decided not to sell Bruntons, a maker of wire rope products,
having failed to negotiate a satisfactory price. This company lost Pounds
300,000, a Pounds 100,000 improvement over the previous period.
The general engineering division enjoyed a 27 per cent increase in profits
to Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 11.5m. The division benefited from sales
of cable controls to companies such as Ford and Vauxhall and from strength
in bronze and aluminium components, but the remainder of the division faced
difficult trading conditions.

FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Alexon falls on profits fear - More bad
news awaited from demerged women's wear company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS OF a second profit warning in six weeks led yesterday to a 17p fall in
the share price of Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer.
The 82p closing level represented a new low since its demerger from
Claremont Garments (Holdings), the Marks and Spencer supplier, in July 1991.
A couple of months after that move the price hit 444p, but it has slid
downhill since under the weight of slack trade in the high street and
management mistakes on stock.
The shares were undermined yesterday as analysts anxiously awaited a
statement about Christmas trading and the January sales. If the news is bad,
annual pre-tax profit could fall to a little more than break-even, compared
with Pounds 11.3m in 1991-92.
Balance sheet worries also emerged, with the focus on the possibility of
further stock write-downs. Net debt at the January year-end may be as much
as three times last year's level, pushing gearing above 60 per cent.
The forecast increase in borrowings from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 20m or more
is only partly accounted for by a delayed tax payment of Pounds 4.5m. Stock
build-up is suspected of having played a part.
Meanwhile Claremont - once the cash cow of the combined group - last week
saw its share price soar to a new high of 337p with the help of a confident
statement from M and S. Yesterday it eased 11p to 326p - still twice its
opening level in July 1991.
Profit forecasts for Alexon had already been knocked back from Pounds 7m to
about Pounds 4m after a profit warning in early December. That announcement
stressed disappointing sales at the Dash leisure wear chain.
Two months earlier Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, had warned that unsold
spring and summer stock, mainly from the Alexon women's wear ranges, would
lead to a stock write-off at the end of the year. Analysts pencilled in a
profit reduction of about Pounds 2m to account for that.
Criticisms levelled at Alexon include that it was slow to change its classic
women's wear formula, for instance remaining wedded to co-ordinates for too
long, and that Dash was vulnerable to competition, deferred spending on
leisure wear and the high fixed cost of prime locations.
Only Eastex, the revamped range for older women, has escaped the scepticism.
Like the Alexon collection it is sold mainly through concessions in
department stores.
In the first half of the year, the group's pre-tax profit fell 46 per cent
to Pounds 2.08m on reduced turnover of Pounds 48.7m. Both the Alexon and
Dash brands suffered like-for-like sales falls of about 10 per cent.
Although the autumn ranges got off to a good start, Dash proved the most
vulnerable to a further sagging of consumer confidence after 'black
Wednesday' on September 16.
The ensuing profit warning also led analysts to forecast a cut in the final
dividend from 7.6p to as little as 2p. This is reflected in the historic
yield of 17 per cent. Claremont is now on 2.58 per cent historically,
significantly below the market average.
At yesterday's closing prices, Claremont's market value was Pounds 131.2m,
Alexon's Pounds 23.7m.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Abbey shores up French arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the mortgage lender and retail bank, yesterday announced
that it had been forced to more than double the capital of Abbey National
France after the subsidiary incurred a large loss last year.
Abbey said it had injected FFr300m (Pounds 36.5m) of additional capital into
the offshoot to meet capital requirements and support future growth. It said
the subsidiary's anticipated loss for 1992 was less than FFr300m.
The group made a Stock Exchange announcement of the loss after the
information was disclosed in press advertisements in France last week. This
was in spite of Abbey being in the close season before its full-year results
in March.
The company said it had put measures in place to ensure that price-sensitive
information would not be disclosed again in this manner.
It said it had made the announcement in order to clarify the loss to the
Stock Exchange.
The anticipated loss means Abbey is likely to have to raise provisions for
France in the second half of the year. It provided a total of Pounds 30m for
bad loans in France, Spain and unsecured British lending in the first half.
Abbey National France, which had capital of FFr207.5m before the injection,
is operating as a mortgage lender on private residential property in France
for both British and French home buyers.
The subsidiary was previously called Ficofrance, and was acquired by Abbey
in 1990. It has mortgage assets of Pounds 700m, and has been badly affected
by the slump in the French property market.
Abbey said that part of the subsidiary's assets was loans to property
developers. It stopped all such lending last April after the extent of the
problems became clear.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Tomkins ahead in spite of sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMKINS, the conglomerate, yesterday reported an 8.2 per cent increase in
earnings per share in the last set of figures before it includes Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the milling baking and grocery product group it acquired last
month.
Earnings per share in the six months to end-October grew 8.2 per cent to
4.87p and pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 43.75m to Pounds 47.07m. The
interim dividend is to be increased 12.1 per cent to 1.805p.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said that the earnings increase was the
product of 'pure organic growth' and demonstrated Tomkins ability to grow
without acquisitions.
The six-month period had been 'one of the toughest six-month periods we have
ever had in Tomkins', Mr Hutchings said. Nevertheless, nearly half its
companies had managed to increase profits in spite of these recessionary
pressures.
Mr Hutchings said little about the integration of RHM other than that it was
'a great opportunity to develop the profitability of a company that has lost
its way'. The group expected to end up with net cash in the bank after the
RHM acquisition. At the end of the reporting period and before the bid,
Tomkins had Pounds 184m of net cash.
Mr Hutchings was cautious about economic recovery even in the US where a
number of its companies, particularly in the industrial products division,
performed well.
The overall operating profit rose to Pounds 39.01m from Pounds 37.04m on
sales 3.2 per cent lower at Pounds 575.5m. The sales reduction was partly
due to the stronger dollar and partly because Tomkins was controlling the
level of activity on both sides of the Atlantic.
This in turn meant operating companies were returning cash to the centre,
allowing interest income to rise 51 per cent to Pounds 6.29m in spite of
falling rates.
Recreational vehicles and bathware helped the industrial products division
to Pounds 14.75m of operating profit, a 33 per cent increase. Operating
profits of Pounds 9.20m, in fluid controls, and Pounds 7.44m in services to
industry were both down, although margins were more or less maintained.
Professional, garden and leisure products were marginally ahead at Pounds
7.63m.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Government urged to look at ACT issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE lobbyists are again pressing the government to find at least a
partial solution to the problem of surplus advance corporation tax before
the Budget this spring.
They hope that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will go further than last
year's budget speech when he merely promised to look at the issue. Since
then no changes have been made.
In aggregate, companies are estimated to be paying Pounds 500m a year too
much in tax because their mainstream corporation tax bill is too low to
offset fully the ACT paid on their dividends.
However, the government is expected to be reluctant to agree to any solution
that would reduce revenues given the size of the budget deficit.
The ACT issue is regarded by many as a structural rather than a cyclical
problem as UK companies expand abroad and earn a higher proportion of
profits internationally.
UK companies argue that they are increasingly at a disadvantage to rivals
based elsewhere, as the ACT system effectively penalises companies which pay
dividends out of non-UK profits. One British finance director said: 'If the
government wants industry to have a level playing field against
international companies then it would be a great help to have some relief
from ACT.'
There is a fear that companies, whose earnings are depressed because of high
tax charges caused by unrelieved ACT, will find it more expensive to raise
new equity capital needed to finance expansion. Another concern is that ACT
deters international holding companies from setting up in the UK.

FT  12 JAN 93 / KIO's Grupo Torras puts 36% holding in Ebro up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO TORRAS, the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled Spanish investment
arm, has put its controlling 36 per cent stake in Ebro, the profitable
domestic food company, up for sale.
Ebro was a successful part of the KIO's Spanish portfolio, which includes
holdings in chemicals, paper, property and financial services. The sale
forms part of the KIO's plan to reduce involvement drastically in Spain. It
last month put Torras into receivership with losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn).
'Each and every one of the top European sugar companies is going to be
interested in the Ebro memorandum,' said a senior US investment banker in
Madrid. The company, which closed its financial year in September with
estimated net profits of Dollars 54m and a Dollars 96m positive cash flow,
has 54 per cent of the domestic sugar market and is Europe's biggest rice
producer. Government officials confirmed yesterday that Torras had awarded
Credit Suisse First Boston the mandate to sell the holding in Ebro, which
could raise more than Dollars 340m.
Much of Torras's stake in Ebro is pledged to creditor banks. Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank, has outstanding loans of Dollars 22m to
Torras guaranteed by about 5 per cent of Ebro stock, Bank of America's
Ebro-pledged loans to the holding company are believed to total more than
Dollars 86m and Chase Manhattan and Sumitomo also hold Ebro equity as loan
collateral to the holding company.
A spokeswoman at Spain's economy ministry, which is supervising Torras'
receivership application, said the government had requested Torras to make a
bloc sale of its Ebro holding.
She denied market rumours in Madrid that the government would prod
Tabacalera, the government-controlled tobacco monopoly that already owns
just under 5 per cent of Ebro, into bidding for the Torras stake.
Analysts said Tabacalera, which is part-owner with Italy's Ferruzzi group of
Elosua, the domestic edible oil group, is the sole Spanish group close to
the agribusiness sector that could approach a deal as big as the one offered
by Torras' disposal of Ebro.
Without a bid by Tabacalera, Ebro is likely to fall to one of the big
European groups. Ferruzzi is viewed as a front-runner among potential
buyers, although analysts speculated it might be ruled out by the EC
Commission because it already has large sugar interests across Europe.
Sudzucker, the German sugar group, is thought to be too busy in eastern
Germany and Belgium to want to take on the Ebro stake. Tate &amp; Lyle, the UK
company with a 6.4 per cent stake in Azucarera, Spain's other main sugar
producer, is rumoured to have decided against involvement.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Trafalgar House's auditors criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL shareholders at Trafalgar House's annual meeting yesterday surprised
the board by voting against the reappointment of its auditors, Touche Ross,
in protest at the company's decision to restate its 1991 accounts.
Trafalgar immediately fell back on the support of its institutional
investors by calling a proxy vote which overwhelmingly backed its decision
to reappoint Touche Ross.
But Mr Alan Clements, chairman, acknowledged the criticism from small
shareholders. He said: 'The question of auditors is one we will have to
return to. We will have a beauty contest on this matter later in the year.'
Shareholders repeatedly voiced their anger that Trafalgar's pre-tax profits
of Pounds 122.4m for the year ending September 30, 1991, had been restated
as a loss of Pounds 38.5m.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel decided that property write-downs
should be taken through the profit and loss account and not through the
reserves.
Mr Alec Spurway, a small shareholder, asked to loud applause: 'What did the
auditors think they were doing when they signed off the 1991 accounts?'
Another accused Touche Ross of acting as the 'directors' poodle' instead of
representing shareholders' interests.
After repeated calls for Touche Ross to defend its performance, Mr David
Jenkins, the partner responsible, argued that the 1991 accounts were true
and fair before the company was forced to restate them. His comments were
greeted with shouts of 'resign'.
In defence of the auditors, Mr Clements said the 1991 accounts 'were right
at the time'.
But Mr Peter Jent, another small shareholder, asked him how he could
reconcile what was said by the company in 1991 and what was going on now.
'It is very disturbing that we have been so badly misinformed,' he said.
Others called for the company to be more open with their investors. Some
shareholders argued that new faces were needed on the board after the
present directors had made such a 'hash of the accounts'.
Mr Clements concluded by saying: 'We are fully aware of what you think of us
. . . and that some of you would like us to go as speedily as possible.'
Trafalgar's ordinary shares fell 2p to 87p; the A shares fell 1p to 85p.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Birt launches big shake-up at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the new director general of the BBC, yesterday embarked on a
fundamental reorganisation of the corporation and its management, designed
to improve its efficiency and accountability.
The changes, Mr Birt promised, would make sure that in the 1990s the
corporation would be able to 'build on its best programme traditions,
enhance its creativity and absorb the best of contemporary management
practice'.
Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will become
deputy director general with special responsibility for bringing together
BBC World Service radio and television. He will also oversee a new
directorate combining the corporation's resource, engineering and services
departments.
In the second big outside appointment, Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes
at Channel 4, will become managing director of BBC Network Radio. She will
also lead a year-long review to define the kind of programmes the BBC should
produce.
The corporation will also set up an annual performance review in every area
to measure performance against stated targets, particularly for programmes.
The blueprint for the future was produced after Mr Birt met with senior
executives in both public and private sector industries.
Mr Birt declined to discuss yesterday whether the BBC had repaid Channel 4
'golden handcuff' money paid to Ms Forgan to encourage her to stay at the
channel. It is believed about Pounds 70,000 has been paid.
Asked about overspending at BBC Television, Mr Birt repeated that Pounds 38m
had been overspent in 1991-92 and his 'best guess' was that Pounds 21m might
be overspent this year. Some senior BBC managers suggest the figure may be
higher.
The new plans include important changes to the way programmes are
commissioned and made. For the first time channel controllers who commission
and schedule programmes will be separated from the departments which produce
them. Both will report to Mr Will Wyatt, who remains network television
managing director.
A study will also be held into the extent to which programme departments
should unite radio and television programme making. Mr Birt said he believed
'bi-media' was the future of the BBC but judged it to be 'too far for one
leap'.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Clinton's budget deficit target may fall short of election
pledge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration's budget deficit reduction goal might fall short
of the targets set during the election campaign, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget
director-designate, hinted yesterday.
Mr Panetta told a Senate confirmation hearing that the administration would
set a credible and enforceable deficit goal.
An important requirement was to stabilise the federal debt as a proportion
of gross domestic product and then try to get the ratio moving down again,
he said. Such a formula would represent an easier target than the goal of
halving the deficit over four years that President-elect Bill Clinton set in
the campaign.
The ratio of debt to GDP is about 50 per cent, having doubled during 12
years of Republican presidential rule.
Mr Panetta also signalled that Mr Clinton would not retreat on plans to
increase federal investment. 'We have to achieve multi-year deficit
reduction that is real and make targeted investments in areas such as
healthcare, education and infrastructure.'
He said Mr Clinton had not yet made any final budget decisions. A short-term
stimulus to accelerate recovery was still under consideration. The pace of
deficit reduction would depend on a judgment of the economy's strength and
it might not be wise to do too much 'up front'.
Mr Panetta indicated that tax cuts for middle-income families, another
Clinton campaign pledge, were a low priority. The administration wanted to
create a more progressive tax system but the immediate task was to make the
'very difficult choices' needed to control the deficit while also addressing
the nation's 'investment deficit'.
He told members of the Senate government affairs committee that all areas of
the budget would be scrutinised for savings, but refused to make specific
pledges. Mr Clinton would present an economic plan to the nation next month.
A full-scale budget would follow in mid-March.
Healthcare costs were 'increasing dramatically', Mr Panetta warned, and if
unchecked would push the deficit towards Dollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) by the
start of the next century.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something disconcerting about watching Sweden grapple with its
economic problems from the vantage point of the UK. Both countries tried in
vain to control inflation by linking their currencies to the D-Mark. Both
are grappling with the consequences: deep recession, a surging budget
deficit and debilitating bad debt problems in the financial sector. Problems
are markedly worse in Sweden's case. But its efforts to extricate itself,
exemplified in yesterday's budget, may hold some lessons for the UK.
Sweden has little room for higher taxes. Raising VAT would only add to the
upward pressures on prices from last year's devaluation. As in the UK, the
chances of seriously cutting the budget deficit may depend on harsh
decisions on benefits. This is hard in a recession. Yesterday's spending
cuts, though in line with expectations, still gave markets pause for thought
about whether they were adequate. Next year's projected deficit of SKr162bn
assumes an optimistic growth expectation of 1.6 per cent.
The question is how such deficits can be financed. One answer, doubly
seductive because it might bring export-led recovery, could be to encourage
capital inflows by allowing the krona to depreciate further. The central
bank worries about the inflationary consequences, but this approach would
allow lower short-term interest rates which, at over 10 per cent, are still
an impediment to recovery. If the budget deficit proves truly intractable,
Sweden may have no choice. Ultimately the same could turn out true of the
UK. In which case arguments about the PSBR undermining equity prices would
take on a very different tone.

FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: D-Mark bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That Italy plans to join the roster of European governments borrowing in
D-Marks comes as no surprise. A large budget deficit, a weakened currency
and depleted foreign currency reserves are features in common with other
recent borrowers - notably Norway, Sweden, Finland and the UK. The Italian
issue will doubtless be seen as a signal of the government's belief that the
depreciation of the lira against the D-Mark has run its course. The lira
rallied yesterday on such sentiment. In fact, the timing looks pragmatic.
The demise of the Ecu bond market last year has narrowed the field for
governments seeking overseas funds. Aside from dabbling in the likes of
sterling and yen, serious borrowers are restricted to D-Marks and dollars.
Since the Bundesbank stoked expectations of lower interest rates again last
week, the German currency was a natural choice. All the more so since last
year's events established the D-Mark as the most potent weapon in the
European central banker's armoury. Intervention in dollars is hardly a reply
to speculators betting in D-Marks. The Bundesbank will doubtless have mixed
feelings about the enhanced international status of the D-Mark bond market.
Given its preoccupation with controlling the money supply, it can hardly
welcome an overhang of off-shore D-Marks. It might equally be enjoying some
quiet satisfaction at the downfall of an Ecu market of which it was always
suspicious.

FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much is made of Tomkins' similarity to Hanson given that is where Mr Greg
Hutchings cut his business teeth. But Hanson seems increasingly interested
in resource-based industries. Perhaps the more apt comparison is with BTR,
which has a canny ability to manage a rag-bag of mature low-technology
businesses. In fact, so resilient has been Tomkins' organic growth that one
wonders where the share price would now stand without Ranks Hovis McDougall.
With 75 per cent of sales in the US and operating companies highly-geared to
economic uplift, an RHM-less Tomkins would surely have topped many
investors' lists of recovery plays.
It thus remains perplexing that Tomkins should sink Pounds 925m into a
seeming quagmire of a non-cyclical UK foods business. One clue lies in BTR's
recent treatment of its Hawker Siddeley acquisition, where rationalisation
provisions now amount to about a quarter of the purchase price. Tomkins
promises its reserves will be on a far lesser scale. Nevertheless, Tomkins
should still be able to reap all the profits gains from rationalisation
without taking any pain above the line.
The market may thus have been wrong to view RHM as a fallible food business
rather than a flabby chunk of Pounds 1.4bn of costs. Tomkins can enhance
profits without selling even one more Mr Kipling cake. When this becomes
apparent, it may recoup its premium rating, notwithstanding growing grumbles
about its quality of earnings.

FT  12 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Called to account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perhaps a pity that yesterday's coup against the auditors at the
Trafalgar House AGM was overturned by the big battalions' proxies.
Shareholders were, to say the least, bemused by the way a Pounds 122m profit
in 1991 had been transformed to a Pounds 38m loss at the stroke of an
accountant's pen. They may also have been irritated that it took the
Financial Reporting Review Panel to encourage the board to second thoughts.
Still, the chairman, Mr Alan Clements, and the auditor, Touche Ross,
doubtless got the message.
Such desire for the ritual sacrifice of auditors grows out of concern about
the abuse of accounting rules and unease over the independence of auditors.
The new financial reporting standards go some way towards providing a more
robust framework, though the irritation of Professor David Tweedie at firms
which ignore the spirit of his changes shows that no structure is proof
against determined creativity. And while the Cadbury committee seeks to
encourage the independence of auditors by strengthening audit committees,
that may not be enough. Even the alternative - rotation of audit firms -
could degenerate into an elaborate Buggin's turn.
Possibly the best way to distance auditors from finance directors is to
widen the auditors' duty of care to shareholders. To balance the increased
risks of legal action against them, auditors might bear limited penalties.
Such economic pressure would undoubtedly focus minds. It would however,
require the Caparo judgment, which severely limits the liability of
auditors, to be overturned. That might prove the hardest task of all.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Hopes rise at Bosnia peace talks: Serb leader makes first
substantial concessions on future constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday made his first
substantial concessions in the Geneva peace talks, raising hopes that
agreements on a future constitution for Bosnia-Hercegovina and a halt to
fighting may be reached in the next few days.
But as Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, joined the talks
officials warned it was still not clear whether the Bosnian Serbs were
prepared to accept the international mediators' most vital conditions for an
agreement.
Although Mr Karadzic said in a radio interview that the Bosnian Serbs were
prepared to sign an agreement that they would not secede from a future state
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, he maintained his demand that the Serbian parts of
the country should be allowed to forge their own international relations.
The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, have proposed the
creation of an independent, sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina, divided into 10
semi-autonomous provinces, which would not, however, have the power to
decide on their own international relations. Specifically, the mediators
have rejected Mr Karadzic's demands for 'a state within a state', which
could later join a greater Serbia.
Yesterday, Mr Karadzic, who has proved to be a master of imprecision and
contradiction when it comes to translating his political demands into the
language of international law, said: 'We don't demand a state within a
state, in the proper sense of the word. What we can't give up is our
identity and personality within Bosnia-Hercegovina.'
As an example of the kind of status he wanted the Bosnian Serbs to have, he
cited the position of Quebec in Canada, 'which has more than 1,000 contracts
with France'.
Significantly, however, the Bosnian Serb leader said more negotiations were
required to provide the Serbs with additional guarantees which would protect
their specific identity in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Later Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, said that despite Mr
Karadzic's reservations, the Bosnian Serb leader was 'leaning very far
towards acceptance'.
Mr Karadzic has been given until 10am today to give his final reply to the
co-chairmen's proposals.
President Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, who is due to rejoin the
talks today after attending the conference of Islamic states in Dakar, will
make sure that the wording of the final constitutional agreement will be as
close as possible to that proposed by the mediators.
Mr Milosevic, after meeting Mr Karadzic separately, gave the impression that
he was anxious to help the conclusion of a peace settlement.

Oh dear, what can the matter be? Yesterday Observer praised the civilised PR
man who, needing to use his portable phone while on a train, made the call
from the lavatory because he was 'too embarrassed to be seen taking the
thing out in a public carriage'. Alas, readers should beware of doing
likewise.
A man who happened to be travelling in the adjacent coach reports that he
and everyone else present overheard not only the remark quoted, but
everything else the would-be discreet caller said in the conversation.
As if that isn't enough evidence that British Rail's lavatories are
leak-prone, its new Class 456 trains' toilets have been locked up for the
winter because they are apt to overflow and affect the brakes.

Expect musical chairs at Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium and
packaging group, where chairman Jean Gandois is rebuilding his recently
depleted executive team.
The top slots in French business and politics are becoming almost as
peppered with ex-Pechiney executives as with alumni of Saint Gobain, the
glass and pipes group, long regarded as the training ground for France's
industrial elite.
Last week Jean-Louis Vinciguerra quit as finance director to become a
managing partner of the Paris arm of the Rothschild banking empire. He is
just the latest in a distinguished list of Pechiney defectors. Martine
Aubry, daughter of Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, left
as Pechiney's social affairs director last year to become labour minister,
while the year before that saw the departure of former managing director
Jean-Martin Folz to become general manager of Eridiana Beghin-Say, the
Franco-Italian food group. And don't forget that other old Pechiney hand,
Bernard Pache - the new boss of Bull, the state-owned computer maker.
So the new faces on Pechiney's executive committee will be worth watching in
the years ahead. No clues yet as to who they will be, though the word is
that they will be insiders.

If yesterday's stormy Trafalgar House annual meeting is anything to go by,
the group should speed up its search for a new chairman to replace poor old
Alan Clements who has been left holding the helm.
Clements, an ex-ICI finance director, may be jolly good at adding up the
figures but he is not the best of persons to control a rowdy AGM and restore
the confidence of small shareholders, still smarting from a slashed
dividend. His diffident and often defensive performance allowed the meeting
to drag on for over two and a half hours - well past lunch time. As any
seasoned chairman should know, it is not wise to keep small shareholders
waiting such a long time for their customary refreshments.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a depressing lesson of history that no matter how much governments say
they are in favour of greater openness, they instinctively try to stifle
legislation designed to achieve it.
Take Harold Macmillan's Conservative administration. Barely a year after
being elected in 1959 with a manifesto promising more openness, the
government sabotaged a private member's bill to open local authority
meetings to the press.
The revelations, published today by the tireless Campaign for Freedom of
Information, gain piquancy from the identity of the backbencher who was
forced to accept a watered-down bill . . . Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the newly
elected MP for Finchley.

Brian Basham's involvement on the murkier side of British Airways' row with
Virgin is not the first time that the best known 'street fighter' in City
public relations has been in a spot of bother. Nor is it likely to be the
last. Although he has come off worst this time, he isn't going to retire
from the trade. He enjoys it too much.
The workaholic son of a south London butcher, he is one of the more enduring
features of the topsy-turvy world of City PR. His nose for a good City story
 -first spotted by the Daily Mail's former city editor Sir Patrick Sergeant
 -has proved valuable over the years to countless journalists who often used
him as a discreet source.
He served his apprenticeship under John Addey, the ex-barrister who invented
modern financial PR. That was nearly 20 years ago and since then Basham has
invariably had a view, and often a role, in many of the City's juicier
stories. In his heyday in the 1980s he was the 'best bid man around', says
one rival. Indeed, some nervous companies hired him to stop him working for
a predator.
A changing City climate has meant that demand for his special
influence-peddling skills is not what it was. But whatever the concerns
about his business methods, and there is an element of sour grapes in some
of the criticisms, he is a street-wise survivor. If he has a fault, it's
failing to follow the motto of one of his proteges, Brunswick's Alan Parker:
'Never get between the client and the footlights'.
Basham's problem is that he frequently does.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROUT of British Airways in its legal battle with Virgin Atlantic raises
some curious questions of business morality. By its own tacit admission, BA
employed some very dubious tactics in trying to overwhelm a smaller
competitor. Are we to suppose that such behaviour is general in the
corporate world? Again, BA technically came to grief not over dirty tricks,
but because it had libelled Mr Branson. Suppose the rest of its behaviour
were within the law. Does that make it acceptable?
The answer to the first question is not wholly simple. The principal charge
against BA boils down to the fact that it sought to divert business from a
competitor. In itself, that is commonplace. If an engineering company hears
a competitor is about to land an order, it will call the customer and try to
change his mind. It is less usual in consumer markets: we might be
surprised, on buying a tin of beans in a supermarket, to find another
bean-maker pressing his own wares upon us at a discount. But that would not
be illegal, simply uncommercial in the context of the price of a tin of
beans. A first-class air ticket might be another matter.
BA's position, in fact, was in many ways exceptional. Despite its apparent
market dominance, it found Mr Branson able to make surprisingly rapid
inroads into some of its most lucrative routes. The airline market is also
unusual in that competitors routinely take on each other's customers and
that their order books are relatively transparent. BA may have been guilty
of arrogance or stupidity in allowing itself to be needled by Mr Branson,
who comes out of the affair as much the better tactician. But perhaps not
every company in BA's position, possessing both the motive and the means,
would have behaved much better.
The second charge against BA is that it sought to blacken Virgin's name
through the press. As any journalist who has covered a contested takeover
can attest, this is not unprecedented behaviour either. In both cases, the
question is not so much what is done as what means are employed to do it. If
a company can be shown to have broken the Data Protection Act, or abused its
market dominance in suppressing competition, or made slanderous allegations,
it can be prosecuted accordingly. But that brings us back to our second
question. Suppose none of these things happened. Does that make it all
right?
The answer, obviously, is no. It is not even necessary here to appeal to
business ethics. The point can be made on practical grounds. If BA has
offended the sense of natural justice in the world at large, its business
will suffer. Its customers may, at the margin, take their business
elsewhere. If it has compromised its reputation for straight dealing in the
eyes of governments, it may find its global ambitions harder to pursue. The
message of the affair, in short, is that dirty tricks have a price of their
own.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Virgin's honour remains intact: Michael Cassell and Paul
Betts track the acrimonious battle between British Airways and its smaller
rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It was the sort of stunt calculated to get right up the nose of Lord King of
Wartnaby, the gruff, tough chairman of British Airways.
Early morning passengers arriving at London's Heathrow airport on July 1
1991 watched in disbelief as a man dressed in pirate clothes, complete with
cutlass and parrot, led an assault on the sleek model Concorde gracing the
exit tunnel.
Within minutes, its BA livery was swapped for that of Virgin Atlantic,
Britain's precocious long-distance airline which that day began flying from
Heathrow.
The man with the parrot was Richard Branson, the bearded, swashbuckling
chairman of Virgin Atlantic, dubbed a 'pirate' by Lord King after Virgin's
success in winning, at BA's expense, extra flights into Toyko's Narita
airport.
The escapade was pure Branson, one in a series of marketing skirmishes
between the two airlines which included the mystery appearance of Virgin
leaflets in BA first-class cabins and the timely arrival of Virgin staff to
wave off the press corps on BA promotional trips.
As one of the Virgin raiders put it: 'We got them very steamed up and
thoroughly enjoyed doing it.'
But, beyond the jolly skirmishes, Virgin was by the summer of 1991 becoming
convinced it was embroiled in a battle for survival with a goliath. Its
competitor daily carried 20 times more passengers in an aircraft fleet
nearly 30 times larger than its own.
The cheeky 'cherry picker' airline knew it was in BA's firing line. It was
already successfully muscling in on some of BA's most profitable,
long-distance routes and had now won its battle to break out from Gatwick
airport.
Virgin was well aware of BA's reputation for seeing off small-fry
competitors. No one could have envisaged, however, the extraordinary
succession of events ending yesterday with BA's climb-down before Mr Justice
Drake.
As the judge heard, Virgin was to find itself the target of a damaging
campaign. Its customers were to be sent a series of extraordinary offers and
questionable initiatives intended to lure them away.
There would be evidence that BA employees shredded documents relating to
Virgin activities and that the airline retrieved passenger information held
on Virgin computers. According to one Virgin executive: 'They knew our
loading on every flight and even where our passengers lived. They knew
everything before Richard Branson.'
A series of mysterious thefts from the vehicles and homes of senior Virgin
personnel, never in any way directly linked to a 'dirty tricks' campaign,
served to heighten fears that the business was under attack.
Whatever the reality, both camps were to become convinced each was being
spied upon by the other.
Branson, the awkward, consummate self-publicist who has narrowly escaped
death in speed boats and hot-air balloons, had managed to survive longer in
the cut-throat airline business than many others
But he realised just how big a foe BA might be as early as 1987, following
BA's Pounds 250m acquisition just before Christmas of British Caledonian,
the Gatwick-based airline.
Under the deal, BA had to honour agreements between BCal and other airlines
for the servicing of aircraft, including Virgin's two 747 jumbos. Within
weeks, BA said it would not service any additions to Virgin's expanding
fleet. Servicing charges rose from Pounds 153 an hour to Pounds 544.
Throughout 1990, Virgin ran into other problems. The BA night simulator at
Heathrow became almost impossible to book for Virgin pilots. But when Virgin
telephoned pretending to be British Midland, training slots became
available.
By the autumn of 1990, Lord King's irritation with Virgin became clear when
Branson, in a burst of publicity, flew UK hostages out of Iraq before the
Gulf war erupted. BA's chairman had harsh words with the Foreign Office.
Almost at once, Virgin fell victim to a price war in which tens of thousands
of cheap BA economy tickets, targeted on Virgin's transatlantic routes,
flooded bucket shops.
At the start of 1991, Virgin won its extra slots at Tokyo, and was roundly
criticised in a BA press release for its expansionist ambitions. Branson
wrote to Lord King saying he resented the level of personal abuse being used
by BA.
In a rare exchange between the two men, Lord King replied: 'As I said to the
Sunday Times, I run my airline, Richard Branson runs his. Best of luck to
him. I do not wish and do not intend to say anything more on the subject.'
Behind the scenes, BA hammered away at the theme that Virgin was a
whingeing, small-time competitor. 'The image,' said a BA man, 'is supposed
to be big bad British Airways and poor little Virgin.'
By now, Virgin had compiled for the EC Commission a draft file of complaints
about alleged anti-competitive action by BA. Branson would also discover for
himself a BA 'switch-selling' programme.
On board a flight to the US, Virgin's chairman was scanning the log in which
upper-class passengers registered their comments, and was intrigued at one
which ran: 'No wonder BA tried to get me to switch flights.' Branson
introduced himself to the passenger and heard of BA's impressive efforts to
woo his customer. Other cases quickly emerged. Travellers were telephoned in
New York hotels at all hours, offered first-class BA seats, free flights or
Concorde trips in return for their Virgin tickets.
An executive from Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, was
approached in the Heathrow lounge, given all the details of his itinerary
and invited to change to BA.
Yvonne Parsons, another regular customer, was telephoned three times to be
told her Virgin flight had problems but that she could fly BA. The names of
genuine Virgin employees, obtained simply by telephoning Virgin offices,
were being used by the mysterious callers.
On both sides of the Atlantic, Virgin upper-class passengers were being
accosted by smartly dressed personnel wearing buttonholes. Virgin dubbed
them BA's 'carnation brigade'.
By the spring of 1991, a former BA marketing department employee disclosed
that documents relating to Virgin, held within BA as part of operation
'Mission Atlantic', had been shredded and dispatched in plastic bin-liners.
Another former BA employee at Gatwick provided evidence that, using BA's own
computer system, specially deputed 'Helpline' staff had systematically
recovered information on Virgin activities and passed it, in plain
envelopes, to superiors.
As information continued to leak out, BA stepped up efforts to find the
'moles' within its own organisation. Virgin claims there were none, with all
its evidence coming from the public or former BA employees.
In March 1991, Branson gave an interview at Gatwick after securing landing
and take-off rights at Heathrow. The breakthrough was bad news for BA,
though Branson emphasised he did not want war with Lord King.
But by the autumn, Virgin had its hands on a copy of a report on Virgin
Atlantic prepared for BA as part of 'Operation Barbara' by Brian Basham, a
City public relations consultant. The document gave a full analysis of BA's
competitor.
It outraged Branson. But Basham has always insisted that the report was a
legitimate study of the airline's strengths and weaknesses. His campaign for
BA had been 'perfectly decent and straightforward'.
As 1991 ended, Virgin received calls from journalists pursuing rumours about
the airline's state of health. Was it true that fuel was having to be paid
for in cash, that the airline was losing Pounds 50m a month? Headlines
asked: 'Will Branson's balloon burst?'
Two weeks before Christmas 1991, Branson wrote to the airline's
non-executive directors, claiming 'black propaganda' was being used to
discredit his airline.
Sir Michael Angus, BA's deputy chairman, replied on behalf of the
non-executives, saying it was inappropriate for him to act. Sir Colin
Marshall, BA deputy chairman and chief executive, said Branson's allegations
were 'wholly without foundation and unjustified'.
Early in 1992, the controversy ignited with the screening of a Thames
Television programme investigating Virgin's 'dirty tricks' claims. Even
before it appeared, BA accused Thames of 'having fallen into the trap of
being used as a vehicle for Richard Branson's propaganda'.
The programme provoked letters of complaint from the public to BA. In
response Lord King again rebutted Virgin's claims, labelling the exercise a
publicity stunt.
An attempt at peace talks between lawyers from both camps collapsed. BA
issued another press release again criticising Virgin.
In March 1992, Branson finalised the sale of his Virgin Music business to
Thorn-EMI for Pounds 560m. Lord King said the Virgin boss was evidently 'too
old to rock and roll and too young to fly'.
But Branson was not too young to sue. On March 14, The Sunday Telegraph
telephoned Virgin to say it might run a story that the airline had hired a
private detective to investigate BA and Lord King.
At the same time, John Thornton, an executive at investment bank Goldman
Sachs who had been involved in the Virgin sale to Thorn-EMI, was asked by
the newspaper if his company had been authorised to hire investigators on
behalf of Virgin.
Enough was enough. Branson believed the avalanche of innuendoes and
falsehoods had gone too far. After a meeting at Branson's Holland Park home,
libel proceedings began, based on written attacks on Virgin's good faith and
integrity in BA News, the airline's staff newspaper, and in a press release.
According to one of those present: 'We couldn't take it any more. It is
tough enough out there but we were convinced BA wanted us out of the
business.'
Though some might believe otherwise, Branson is said not to have enjoyed his
battle with BA and is anxious to concentrate on building the business.
Virgin intends by 1995 to expand its fleet from eight to 18 aircraft and to
be flying into the world's top 12 cities. By then, it wants 30 per cent of
Britain's transatlantic traffic.
As BA tries to put yesterday's unpleasant proceedings behind it, the
airline's management concedes it underestimated Branson's determination and
business cunning and that, surprisingly for an airline with a good
management record, made a series of misjudgments which allowed it to be
outwitted.
Although BA is going to ground in the aftermath of the libel settlement, the
important question remains of how the airline allowed events to spiral out
of control.
Did the top management really know what was happening? Yesterday's court
statement claimed it did not, although an affidavit served on the two
airlines by Basham says he never acted without the knowledge or approval of
the BA board. On occasions, he says he tried to stop the airline spreading
disparaging rumours.
But how were some BA people given freedom to pursue a series of highly
questionable initiatives, placing at risk BA's hard-won reputation? Or was
BA blinded by arrogance, encouraged by the company's commercial success?
In retrospect, BA's tactical error in its tussle with Virgin was to give
Branson the chance to invoke libel proceedings. On any other legal grounds,
Branson could have found it hard to extract retribution.
Although some senior BA managers wanted to fight Branson all the way, Lord
King decided that a prolonged and theatrical libel case would have been a
public relations disaster. BA would pay up.
Damages apart, BA can ill afford to see its reputation further undermined at
a time when it is set upon becoming a global carrier by acquiring stakes in
international airlines.
The fiasco is not expected to claim any immediate victims among the higher
ranks of BA management. 'A few ties may be tightened around a few necks but
heads will not roll,' according to an executive.
In a few months' time, however, BA sees the end of an era when Lord King,
the architect of the airline's success, steps aside to become president. He
will no doubt be hoping that the embarrassing saga will by then have been
largely forgotten.
In the meantime, he has more immediate priorities. With the retirement of
his butler, the 75-year old BA chairman is searching for an attentive,
professional and caring replacement. An experienced, first-class cabin
attendant could fit the bill, though it might be unwise for any Virgin
employee to apply.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Leading Article: New BBC broom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the new director-general of the BBC, has moved swiftly to
assert his style. The announcement yesterday of senior managerial changes
and the accompanying statement of vision are intended to chart the
organisation's path in a rapidly changing broadcasting world.
Mr Birt's game plan has the merit of being clear. He wishes to persuade the
government to continue for another decade to fund the BBC with the proceeds
of a licence fee payable by those who own a TV set.
The argument, initiated at the end of last year in the BBC's response to the
government's green paper, is that an expanding commercial sector in
broadcasting still needs to be supplemented by a substantial public
corporation. To support the case for a new charter and licence fee, Mr Birt
has also recognised that the BBC must become more efficient and more
accountable. It has, after all, just mislaid over Pounds 50m.
There are two hallmarks of the Birt approach. The first is that he intends
the BBC to be a managed institution, rather than an agglomeration of
committees and warring baronies. This is sensible. It is barely credible
that, prior to these reforms, the BBC had no top-level management forum to
discuss programme priorities.
The second is that Mr Birt envisages the BBC withdrawing from areas crowded
with commercial competitors. Many wasted words have been spent on which soap
opera or game show might fall into this exclusion zone but, in principle, Mr
Birt is right. The public does not need the BBC to do everything and the BBC
cannot afford to do everything well.
However, it remains to be seen whether Mr Birt's 'producer choice', a
complex administered market which seeks to devolve managerial power, will
work. Mechanisms like this, which seek to create artificial markets without
permitting those involved to set prices or take true risks, have a history
of freezing into the same kind of bureaucratic inertia as the command
economies they seek to replace. But there is no doubt that Mr Birt's radical
recasting of the BBC's central bureaucracy is a step in the right direction.
Equally, the intention of the plans announced yesterday to improve
accountability cannot be faulted, although they ignore the fact that the BBC
is already burdened with a creaking apparatus of advisory and regulatory
bodies.
The approach, in short, is in tune with these Majorite times, applying an
earnest, schematic pragmatism to the modernisation of a large public
service. The BBC hopes that it thereby strikes less comfortable questions
from the agenda, such as: is it sensible to have such a big organisation
cornering all the public funding for broadcasting? Will the licence fee
still be defensible when, in 10 years' time, the BBC's share of the TV
audience is down from almost 50 to perhaps 30 per cent? Those who think
these questions pertinent will want to see a more vigorous debate than a
dull green paper has yet stimulated.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A last task for Mr Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS the Gatt's Uruguay round had been given up for dead, US and European
Community trade negotiators have rushed to Geneva in a last effort to bring
the six years of negotiation to a conclusion. They are right to do so. Mr
Bush, in particular, has nothing to lose by pushing them hard in his
remaining week in office. He would, on the contrary, be doing a favour to
his own reputation, to his successor, to his country and to the world.
It is not that a completed Uruguay round would resolve the world's trading
problems, nor even that any deal reached in the US president's remaining
days could ensure success for the round. But without such a deal, failure
would seem certain. If nothing has been decided by January 20, when Mr
Clinton takes over, the conflicting priorities of his administration,
combined with the looming expiry of the 'fast track' authority, are likely
to make agreement too difficult and, above all, too late.
First evidence of a last push came when the EC commissioner newly
responsible for trade policy secretly met Mrs Carla Hills, his US
counterpart, outside London on January 2. They agreed that time was too
short to continue pressing for a complete Uruguay round package, and decided
to focus, instead, on more limited objectives. A substantial US-EC agreement
on market access - that is, on lower tariffs on manufactured goods - was to
be the focal point of these negotiations.
The US wants the EC to join in abolishing a number of tariffs altogether.
The sectors proposed are pharmaceuticals, non-ferrous metals, wood and paper
products, and - most controversially - electronics, where EC anxieties about
Japanese exports remain high. For its part, the EC wants the US to tackle
its tariff peaks. These include glass and ceramics, but the most sensitive
is textiles, where some US duties approach 40 per cent. The EC's case is
strong. Lowering high tariffs is economically far more important than
reducing low ones.
Negotiators talked yesterday of 'exceedingly difficult' talks. But these are
at least within traditional areas of Gatt activity. Negotiators must also
remember what is at stake. Success will recreate momentum. Failure would
risk all that has been achieved in six weary years, including the package of
farm subsidy cuts agreed in Washington a month ago, which narrowly averted
an international trade war.
Market access negotiations between the US and the EC would not be the end of
the story. Other countries must participate and other areas of the
negotiation need to be resolved. Japan and Korea should, for example, open
their markets to rice imports.
The round is now on borrowed time. An outline agreement on most issues needs
to be on the table when President Clinton takes over. If he vetoes it, so be
it. But at least the round would not have perished by default.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That rattling you heard over the weekend was the sound of pea-sized ideas
shaking about in the brainboxes of our politicians. There is no new song.
There is only the rhythm of maracas. This is not our leaders' fault. They
strive to think big, but are obliged by circumstance and their own intrinsic
qualities to think small.
Mr John Major is the puppet of events. He does well to stand straight when
fate pulls his strings. Mr John Smith is constrained by the antiquated
mechanisms of the Labour party. He could point it in a more auspicious
direction, if he knew what that was. Whether it would then move forwards is,
shall we say, open to doubt.
We must not deride these well-meaning souls for their inability to create
new visions. The prime minister was not elected to the post of
visionary-in-chief, nor is he suited to such a post. The leader of the
official opposition is not a philosopher. He is a Scottish lawyer. On the
basis of his track record since last summer, he has become the uninspiring
manager of a decaying party of the left. The hard truth is that, while both
Mr Major and Mr Smith are 'nice', neither is extraordinary. Ordinary men
have no option but to make the best they can of small-print politics, and
the roll of the dice. It would surprise us all if either of them emerged as
the progenitor of a grand new mission for Britain.
In any case, the intellectual climate is not conducive to such a project.
Before the 1980s, it was respectable to argue that society could be
restructured by a reforming government. The left talked of 'building
socialism'. Progress was assumed to be inevitable. The establishment of the
welfare state after 1945 was seen, correctly, as a permanent improvement in
the British polity. Other wheezes were harmful. Nationalisation was the
consequence of a postwar delusion about the efficacy of planning by
officials. Nonsense about a permanent and irreversible shift of power to the
working classes was seriously debated. All politicians promised peace,
prosperity, full employment and the warm embrace of welfare. The voters,
poor suckers, believed them.
The then Mrs Margaret Thatcher was history's corrective mechanism. The
mission she discerned in 1979 seems obvious in 1993. She denationalised
industries, rolled back the frontiers of the state, crunched the trade
unions and, most memorably, insisted that public enterprises keep proper
books. 'Value for money' may be a tired slogan, but it is the most precious
legacy of the Thatcher years. Before the former prime minister came along,
public sector managers could not count pennies. It did not occur to them
that they should. To instil in their heads the idea that they must tailor
expenditure to income was a worthy project.
Today there is nothing on offer as striking as the revolutionary idealism of
the 1960s or the counter-revolution of the 1980s. Until Black Wednesday,
when sterling was withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism, both
Mr Major and Mr Smith rested on the proposition that Britain's mission was
to be a successful European state. Their attitude to this was bipartisan.
Our governing purpose was to become 'the best in Europe'. Only the social
charter divided the parties. The ERM and, by implication, monetary union
were the lodestars. Thus guided, we would achieve non-inflationary growth.
The European project still has merit, but it will no longer serve as a
theoretical underpinning to justify the careers of the Conservative or
Labour leaders. As such, it was blown out of the water on September 16.
The weekend's deliberations by the two main parties were therefore less than
elevated. The principal concern was how to win votes. Designing a blueprint
for a better society was not on the agenda. In Labour's case, the greatest
heat was reserved for an argument about whether the official opposition
should stay as it is, and lose a fifth election in a row, or learn the
lesson of US President-elect Bill Clinton's appeal to the middle classes.
Taken to its logical conclusion, an emulation of the new Democrats'
transatlantic success would place Labour alongside or slightly to the right
of Mr Major's Conservatives. Don't scoff. That could be Mr Smith's only
hope.
I was not present at, nor did I bug, the private conversations between Mr
Major and the Conservative chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, at Chequers on
Sunday and yesterday. The prime minister's staff is reported as saying that
the talks were about improving choice, opportunity, responsibility and
enhanced ownership. The agenda included the promotion of business and
enterprise, particularly through de-regulation; health and education
reforms, especially widening opportunities for 16 to 19-year-olds; the
Citizen's Charter; and tackling crime. Meanwhile the Treasury's parallel
meeting discussed how to get out of the fiscal hole into which the
government has dug itself. Wonderful stuff, but it hardly replaces the
empire, or the heart of Europe, or zero inflation.
Great themes do exist, but only in the abstract. It is possible to put
constitutional reform at the head of the agenda. The Liberal Democrats have
done so; Labour might. There is plenty to say about the dangers of one-party
rule, the systematic destruction of local government, the emergence of the
patronage state as powerful appointed bodies proliferate and, indeed, Celtic
nationalisms. I suspect that little of this would win many votes in England.
A slightly more electorally profitable approach might be to debate the
effect of growth on the environment, and environmental protection on growth.
The new Clinton administration will probably lead the way. It is bound to be
green, and bound to promote growth.
When prosperity returns, green politics will again become fashionable, as Mr
Major's Conservatives know well. But their immediate ob-jective is to
recover from a terrible autumn. Their medium-term mission is to win again.
The consequence is clear. Britain is destined to be governed as what it is -
a middling country muddling along, with no particular place to go.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Personal View: Italy fudges privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICCARDO GALLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks the Italian government has won approval from parliament for
the privatisation of four state-owned holding companies - Iri, Eni, Enel and
Ina. Each of these giants is an industrial or public services sector leader
and, respectively, they embrace oil supply, refinery and distribution,
electrical energy, and insurance. However, a closer look reveals that this
is not a real privatisation process.
In 1991, the global group turnover of Iri, Eni and Enel exceeded Pounds
67bn, but the net income was scarcely Pounds 450m and financial debts were
Pounds 50bn. Employees totalled 650,000, thus accounting for 3.6 per cent of
Italy's total workforce. In 1992, the performance of all these companies
worsened. Meanwhile, the Ina insurance group's net premium was Pounds 2.3bn
in that year.
In the 20 years to 1990, the growth of the Italian economy was among the
highest in the western world, second only to Japan in the Group of Seven.
This spectacular growth was supported by a massive injection of public funds
into the economy which helped to overcome the energy crisis and to keep the
economy growing during the most severe world slumps. At the same time,
though, it created the headache of an enormous public debt, requiring a
debt-service cost of more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product per
year.
Simultaneously, an industrial structure grew up resembling that of a
developing country rather than that of the US or Germany. For example, small
and medium-sized firms account for the great bulk of Italian industrial
production. Only seven Italian companies (Iri, Eni and a few other private
companies) are included in the Fortune 500 world list, as compared with 43
in the UK.
The present management of the companies controlled by Iri, Eni, Enel and Ina
has a strong political orientation - particularly towards the Christian
Democrat and Socialist parties. The former has been present in government
for the last 45 years without interruption, and has required management to
pursue both technical and political goals. As a consequence, the political
influence of management has grown to a point where it is able to obtain
unusually favourable financial and legislative choices from parliament and
government. Since parliament and government act on behalf of the companies'
stockholder - the state  - the management's stockholder relationship has
become contrary to normal practice.
In recent weeks, Italy may seem to have been influenced by the wave of
privatisation sweeping the rest of Europe. However, the Italian government
merely wishes to strengthen the state-owned corporations and collect new
risk capital through partial privatisation, without selling companies to
private industrial investors, or liberalising monopolistic services. In
other words, the government wishes to maintain state shareholding control,
as does management, which is strongly opposed to complete privatisation.
In the UK or the US, privatisation is partial when a public entity retains
ownership of assets or infrastructure while operation and maintenance are
carried out by private interests. In Italy, partial privatisation mostly
means that a shareholder, such as Iri or Eni, sells a minority holding in
its subsidiaries to private investors who have no interest in company
administration or management. This explains why the Italian treasury
minister is currently looking for partners among Arab investors, with the
approval of the present management.
The only complete privatisations in Italy are to be the sale of the Iri
bank, Credito Italiano, and the Eni mechanical company, Nuovo Pignone. As
such, they will be of interest to British investors. They also explain why
the same minister is coming to London this week.
The Italian government cannot be expected to do much better with its
privatisation programme, for it is still based on the political alliance
between the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, both of which are
losing votes with every election and are traditionally suspicious of the
private sector. Moreover, the government is precarious and somewhat weaker
than the management opposing it.
For this reason, a precondition of any real privatisation process in Italy
will be a wholesale change in politics. A new government will be able to
liberalise public services and sell ownership of state companies only if it
is based on forces, or groups of people, free from old Christian Democrat
and Socialist power.
There are in Italy some liberal political groups and new growing forces
which have condemned the old alliance and wish to break their exclusive
right to control the supply of goods, services and politics. These groups
and forces favour the reduction of public expenditure, the opening of all
markets to small and medium-sized firms, and the linking of pay to
performance.
As the government is currently in financial difficulties, the wholesale
change may be achieved more rapidly than people think.

engineering faculty of the University of Rome and a former vice-chairman of

FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: Supertanker companies should assume burden of
liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a grim truth that is not even denied by international shipping
organisations: operating supertankers will always cause disastrous oil
spills ('Shipping bodies say oil spills 'inevitable' ', January 7). Of
course these risks can, and have to be, minimised by a more careful planning
of tanker routes in order to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and
better shipping standards. But the level, and type, of supertanker activity
has to be questioned as well. Unfortunately, your editorial, 'Oil spill in
the Shetlands' (January 7) completely misses the latter point.
Common economic wisdom tells that economic efficiency can only be hoped for
if all market participants are forced to take account of each and every cost
arising from their activities. With supertanker operations this is not the
case. Owing to limited liability, only a fraction of the damage to the
environment has to be paid for by the operator.
A compensation fund like the one set up by the International Maritime
Organisation, even if liability were not limited, does not help either, as
from the viewpoint of a single operator and/or oil importing country it
requires only a lump-sum contribution irrespective of the kind and level of
its activities. The question is not whether 'a pay-out is guaranteed in a
reasonable period of time', but whether he who has caused the damage has to
pay for it.
In contrast to your dismissal, the 1990 US oil pollution act enacted in the
wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster is the most sound answer to this problem
yet. There is just one simple device missing. In addition to unlimited
liability insurance should be mandatory in order to avoid the 'corporate
veils' which you correctly identified as the main obstacle to the
workability of the act. Then, in a competitive insurance market, premiums
would roughly equal the expected damage and thus force the
internationalisation of all external costs. Such a system would even provide
incentives for better shipping standards, as any reduction of the risk of an
accident would be neglected by lower premiums.
If, with such a scheme, supertanker operations would cease to be
commercially viable, the consequence is and should be obvious; society would
have to dispense with them, and should have done so long ago. Limiting
liability is but a subsidy and, as with all subsidies in the absence of
public good effects, creates economic inefficiency. Supertanker operations
can hardly be described as a public good.

FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: Cues that are still holding back women in management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms EILEEN M O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I found it refreshing to read that it is recognised, at least across
the Atlantic, that women continue to encounter the impenetrable glass
ceiling in the workplace in the US ('Women take stock of Wall Street',
January 6). This issue is one of attitude that will take some time to
remedy.
Perhaps management is only taking its cues from the general population. My
favourite memory is one of a call I received that had been transferred from
the receptionist. Upon answering the phone I was immediately asked: 'Are you
the secretary?' It took great restraint for me not to reply 'No, are you the
plumber?' I do not understand what it is about the tone in one's voice that
indicates a profession. Perhaps I should have studied voice psychology
rather than economics.
Also ironic was that in the three-quarter page 'Who's News' section of the
Wall Street Journal (January 6) there was not a single mention of a female.
In a country this size I find it difficult to believe that there was not one
corporate move or appointment of a female that was newsworthy. Ah, but alas,
the chocolate-chip cookie has already been perfected. What more is there for
us to do?

FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: NHS and cost of consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY HASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to thank Dr Draper ('Look to consultants for NHS
efficiency', January 5) for acknowledging the important role of independent
hospitals in providing facilities in London. In fact, the King's Fund report
acknowledged that the proportion of elective surgery taking place in
independent hospitals is at least 33 per cent.
At a time when the government is emphasising choice for patients, one in
five of London's population is so doing in opting for independent
healthcare. Why should Dr Draper wish to restrict consultants' choices?
It could be that he raised valid points for discussion; however, could the
National Health Service afford to pay consultants the market rate which
would more than double the NHS medical consultants' bill? In fact,
independent hospitals are subsidising the NHS by allowing consultants to
achieve their earnings expectations and significantly contributing to the
health of the capital.
