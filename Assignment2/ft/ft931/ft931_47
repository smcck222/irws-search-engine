FT  07 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Weaker tone in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a much weaker tone to trading in both European cash and futures
yesterday as pressures inside the exchange rate mechanism eased, writes
James Blitz.
Cash rates in the French franc market fell as the currency strengthened
against the D-Mark, moving above FFr3.41 per D-Mark. There was continuing
tension in the Irish punt money market, with the authorities announcing that
overnight rates will be set at 50 per cent from today.
The effects of Tuesday's Franco-German communique supporting the franc
continued to be felt in markets, and there was a little more confidence
about the prospects of the franc surviving the current crisis without the
need to devalue.
Three-month money fell to 12 7/8 per cent from the 14 per cent rate of the
day before, and the overnight rate was down to 12 1/2 per cent from
Tuesday's 15 per cent.
The more positive tone was felt in French franc futures, where the March
contract finished 17 basis points higher at 90.46.
Euromark futures enjoyed a minor rally yesterday following rumours that the
Bundesbank was planning a 50 basis-point cut in the Lombard rate to support
the French franc. The March contract rose 7 basis points to a high of 92.25
on the rumour, but fell back to close unchanged on the day at 92.18 after it
failed to be substantiated.
Indeed, what hard news there was from the Bundesbank tended to be bearish.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said inflation continued to
be the central bank's top priority. It was also disclosed that there would
be no news conference following today's meeting of the central bank's
council, which was interpreted as implying that there will be no rate cut.
In the sterling markets, dealers ignored the sharp appreciation of the pound
against both the D-Mark and dollar. Cash and futures prices implied that
there will be no imminent cut in UK base rates.
The March short sterling contract slipped 10 basis points to a low of 93.30,
but partially recovered to end at 93.35.
In the cash market, three-month money was unchanged at around 7 1/4 per
cent. One dealer said base rates were probably going down, but that the next
reduction may not be until after the spring.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Huge harvest tests strength of
Chicago bulls - The supply of cheap feed grains is also fuelling a boom in
US livestock production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO grain futures are starting the year burdened by the huge harvest
that has just been completed and by the uncertain status of a key export
market - the former Soviet Union. Still, poor harvests in other areas of the
world and prospects for smaller US crops next autumn should provide ample
speculative opportunities in the futures markets through the year, analysts
say.
The supply of cheap feed grains is also fuelling a boom in livestock
production, a factor that is likely to weigh down Chicago cattle and hog
futures prices as the year wears on.
Mr Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers, says
the very sharp drop in animal feed costs virtually ensures that total US
meat output in 1993 will be a record. He projects overall production of US
beef, pork, and poultry at 68bn lbs this year, 3 per cent above the 1992
record.
Despite the output boost, Mr Levitt says prices will be lower, 'but there
will be no train wreck'. Larger meat exports, lower retail pork margins and
expanding meat processing capacity in the US will help to absorb the
surplus. He projects prices for choice fed cattle on the southern plains at
about Dollars 70 a hundredweight by the third quarter, about Dollars 4 below
last year's price. For hogs, he expects average prices to be Dollars 1 to
Dollars 3 below 1992 levels.
The biggest event for US meat and grain markets in 1992 was the enormous US
maize crop. The US Department of Agriculture is scheduled to release its
final maize production figure on January 12, but for now the harvest is
estimated at a record 9.3m tonnes. Despite reported crop losses in northern
states, where foul weather delayed harvesting, prominent analysts say record
yields in other states will cause the production figure to be revised
upward, to about 9.4m tonnes in next Tuesday's report. If that happens,
traders expect the price of maize for March delivery at the Chicago Board of
Trade to drop below the current Dollars 2.14 1/2 a bushel contract low.
However, Mr Dale Gustafson, senior grains analyst for Smith, Barney, Harris
and Upham, believes the same report will show heavy US maize use. Despite
its abundance, the 1992 maize crop has been low in protein, encouraging
heavier consumption for livestock feeding.
'My bias is that next week's report will suggest more domestic maize
consumption in the first quarter (of the crop year) than the trade
perceives,' he says. Prices are already near the low for the year, Mr
Gustafson points out, and he expects that domestic and export demand will
gradually pull futures prices higher, though not much above the Dollars
2.30-a-bushel level.
Analysts are not counting on Russia as an export market for US feedgrains in
the first quarter, given its credit problems. Still, other importers are
expected to fill the gap; South Africa, for example, is expected to be a net
maize importer this year because of its own poor crop.
With the US government requiring farmers to set aside 10 per cent of their
maize acreage next year in order to receive price supports, the 1993 harvest
is expected to be considerably smaller. Mr Dick Loewy, an analyst with
AgResource, projects the yet-to-be planted 1993 maize crop at 8.3m bushels,
about 1m lower than 1992's. Prospects for a smaller new crop could drive
maize for December delivery up to Dollars 2.60 by the summer.
An unusual aspect of the US maize situation is that most of the 1992 surplus
is being held by farmers, rather than the government. Low market prices have
discouraged commercial sales of the grain. In other years, farmers would
have surrendered the grain to the government loan programme, but this year
the loan price is so low that they have chosen to keep their maize - a
factor that could prompt a flood of grain on to the market as prices begin
their projected summer recovery, putting a lid on the advance.
On the surface, the US wheat situation is more conducive to a rally. The
USDA projects stocks of US wheat at a mere 498m bushels at the end of this
marketing year, compared with more than 2bn bushels of maize. However,
market watchers are enthusiastically recommending selling Chicago wheat
futures for March delivery every time the contract bumps above Dollars 3.60
a bushel.
'I expect the (USDA) will have to cut their estimates for domestic wheat
consumption and export demand. I think our carryout is moving closer to 600m
bushels than 500m,' says Mr Warren King, an analyst with Cargill Investors
Services.
Although Canada had a poor wheat crop, and there has been talk of troubles
with the Australian crop this week; China's purchases of US wheat have been
disappointing; and Russia, on the of largest US wheat importers, is being
counted out of the market at least until March, leaving about 2.5 million
tonnes of projected demand in limbo. Russia is more than Dollars 120m in
arrears on its US-backed loans, with refinancing dragging on in
multinational negotiations.
Unlike maize, wheat prices will get little solace from new crop plantings.
Winter wheat sowed in southern plains states has received plentiful moisture
and promises a bumper crop. More acres have been planted to wheat for 1993
than last year, because the government eliminated all wheat acreage
set-aside requirements. Analysts are already projecting wheat futures for
July delivery to trade at Dollars 2.85 a bushel or less, more than 30 cents
per bushel below the present price.
Analysts project some boom and bust pricing for soyabean futures and for
soya oil and soya meal. Troubled Canadian, Chinese and European Community
oilseed crops have left the US as the only global oilseed and meal supplier
until southern hemisphere crops are harvested this spring.
'The EC upped its import volume to make up for its own poor harvest, plus
the dollar was very weak and the protein in oilseeds was priced cheaper than
its grain equivalents. All that resulted in frontloading (bringing forward)
EC imports from the US,' says AgResource's Mr Loewy.
As a result, 67 per cent of projected US soyabean exports has been sold only
4 months into the crop year. The export pace tailed off in November, but Mr
Loewy and other analysts are projecting that US soyabean prices will rise to
Dollars 6 a bushel or more by March. Very quickly after that, however, the
realities of a record-breaking Brazilian crop are likely to stall any rally.
Mr Loewy forecasts a 10.2 per cent increase in Brazilian soyabean acreage,
with Brazilian officials estimating a crop between 2m and 3m tonnes higher
than last year's 19.2m tonnes.
Until the Brazilian harvest however, the markets will shift on every rumour
of crop conditions, fuelling flurries in the Chicago soyabean futures pit.

said it would destroy all substandard beans whenever they were discovered,
reports Reuter from Abidjan.
The 60 tonnes was only a test batch to find the best way of burning the
beans and more would be burnt tomorrow, officials said.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean miners plan to dig
deeper for gold profits - Two big projects are set to reverse the region's
output decline of recent years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD PRODUCTION in the Caribbean Basin, which has been declining in recent
years, is set to increase significantly through two major projects at
opposite ends of the region.
The government of the Dominican Republic is soon to approve one of three
competing bids from foreign companies to construct facilities for mining
low-grade transitional gold deposits sandwiched between now exhausted oxide
layers and the richer sulphide deposits below.
To the south, production has started this month at a major gold mine owned
by two Canadian companies and the Guyana government. Production from the new
mine will see Guyana's national output increasing four-fold next year.
Production in the Dominican Republic has been declining steadily over the
past decade as the country's oxide deposits have approached exhaustion. The
state-owned producer, Rosario Dominicana, invited bids from the foreign
companies for constructing facilities for exploiting transitional deposits
at Pueblo Viejo in the country's north.
From an original slate of six, the government has short-listed three
companies - Davy McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering of Australia, and
Paulo Abib/Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil. They have estimated the cost of the
project between USDollars 200m and Dollars 248m, and anticipate gold
production between 1,100 and 1,200 troy ounces a day.
Government officials say that the fall in gold production from 412,991
ounces in 1981 to 110,000 ounces last year, caused by exhaustion of the
traditional oxide deposits, has created the need for access to the lower
sulphide ores. They say that exploiting the transitional zone, which will be
worked for about three years, will allow access to sulphide deposits which
will be exploited for the subsequent 25 years.
About 5m tonnes of ore will be worked in the transitional zone, and the
anticipated yield is put by Rosario representatives at three times that of
the traditional oxide zone. These sulphide deposits have recently been
estimated to be 100m tonnes.
The mining of the transitional deposits is also expected to reverse the
decline in the country's silver production. The three companies bidding for
the contract estimate that silver production could be between 2,300 and
3,500 ounces a day.
In Guyana, production has started at the new mine in Omai District, said by
Guyanese officials to be among the larger mines in South America. The mine
is expected to produce 1.9m ounces of gold over the next 10 years.
Cambior of Montreal owns 60 per cent of the Omai mine, with Golden Star
Resources, also of Canada, holding 35 per cent and the Guyana government the
remainder. The mine's milling rate will be 13,000 tonnes a day, with gold
output next year projected at 280,000 ounces. Annual production in the first
three years is expected to average 255,000 ounces a year, with the mine's
operating cost averaging Dollars 185 per ounce.
Production is projected to fall to 40,090 ounces in 2003, the last
operational year of the mine.
The capital cost of the project is Dollars 152m, and Cambior reported that
Dollars 120m of this was raised by the company through a syndicated 330,000
ounce gold loan. There was apparently concern initially among the Canadian
investors about the investment climate in Guyana, although the government in
recent years has moved dramatically from a policy of state control of the
economy and has invited foreign investors. Cambior said it had obtained
foreign investment insurance coverage of Dollars 163m from the Export
Development Corporation of Canada.
The Omai mine is working the deposits with open pits over a 40 square
kilometre (16 square mile) area.
The Guyana Geology and Mines Commission is anticipating national gold
production this year at 385,000 ounces, which is almost four times last
year's output.
The commission said the projected increase was based on the start of
operations at the Omai mine, and increased output from alluvial deposits in
the Madhia District and from 'sustained production' from small and medium
scale producers.
'Guyana will then rank fifth in gold production in South America behind
Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador,' the commission said. 'It will also
rank fifth in gold reserve status in Central and South America and the
Caribbean as exploration by foreign mining companies has put current gold
reserves in excess of 3.9m ounces.'
Cambior is a relative newcomer to the Omai venture, having replaced Placer
Dome, also of Canada, which pulled out of the project, arguing that it would
not be feasible at the market price for gold.
It is not the first time deposits at Omai have been exploited. Just after
the turn of the century, German, Dutch and Guyanese gold miners abandoned
their works at Omai, after extracting 136,000 ounces over several years.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's oil output cut as
storms rage
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEGIAN North Sea crude oil production fell sharply yesterday as raging
storms forced the closure of one field and threatened to halt production at
others, according to Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company.
Norway's total output of 2.3m barrels per day dropped by 25 per cent before
the sea calmed, allowing tankers to dock and full production to resume last
night.
Production from the Statfjord field, Norway's biggest oil field which is
operated by Statoil, was cut to 190,000 barrels a day from 700,000 while the
100,000 b/d Snorre field, operated by Saga Petroleum, was briefly closed.
The Snorre floating tension leg platform also suffered some minor damage.
Last night three tankers were docking at Statfjord, said Statoil. Storage
tanks of the three platforms at Statfjord had been virtually full because
tankers had been unable to dock for several days. Each tanker can suck out
more than a day's output from the vast tanks.
Statoil added that a tanker was also loading oil at the Gullfaks field.
Production from Gullfaks had had just one day or so of production left due
to limited storage capacity.
Tankers load oil from storage tanks situated in the legs of the Gullfaks
platform substructure.
The Gullfaks field set a production record on January 1, when output hit
530,000 barrels. Gullfaks averaged 431,000 b/d last year.

COPPER prices fell in dollar terms at the London Metal Exchange in what
dealers described as a consolidation following recent strong gains. The
three months price ended Dollars 10 lower at Dollars 2,350 a tonne. The
dealers noted that the market was still holding support levels. A late
technical sell-off snuffed out a partial rally in ALUMINIUM, the three
months position closing at Dollars Dollars 1,232 a tonne, down Dollars
13.25. Trading in aluminium was fairly volatile, with the market under early
pressure from option-linked selling. But it moved off its lows when Dollars
1,200 call (buying) strikes were exercised. NICKEL was easier following
early losses, although prices held near the middle of the day's range. Three
months metal closed at Dollars 6,297.50 a tonne, down Dollars 115, and fell
another Dollars 17.50 in after hours trading. SILVER prices were firmer,
with the cash position closing 4 cents higher at 371.50 cents a troy ounce.
But dealers were not expecting further gains. 'We did actually see quite
good selling most of the way up, so silver has probably done enough for
now,' one said.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slide in coffee prices
continues as 'squeeze' ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COFFEE prices continued to fall sharply yesterday, decisively ending
the rally which had boosted the New York market by more than 70 per cent
between August and Christmas.
In London the March robusta contract closed at Dollars 930 a tonne, down
Dollars 44 on the day following a fall of Dollars 38 on Tuesday. New York's
nearby arabica contract, which went from 48.10 cents a lb in late August to
touch 83.55 cents in Christmas week, was hovering above 70 cents in late
trading yesterday after falling 3 cents on Monday.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said the
retracement in a market that was 'not rational' marked the end of a classic
squeeze. He believes that some roasters who were caught short as the market
soared are now fully covered.
However, Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man, said that the retreat
was mainly technical, following a sharp reduction in the long position held
by commodity funds and speculators in New York. Last week they were reported
to be holding 12,000 lots, equivalent to 3.5m bags (60 kg each).
London traders said the robusta market had followed New York down. 'I may be
over-simplifying, but it looks like New York is trying to find a foothold at
70 cents,' said one, adding that market confidence had 'taken a severe
bashing'.
Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said prices had been
hit by speculative liquidation, but she was convinced that the fall did not
mark the end of the recent bull run, which had been underpinned by good
fundamentals, especially an expected fall in Brazilian production.
Recent figures from Landell Mills Commodities Studies show world production
down to 87.04m bags last year from 1991's 93.87m bags. Consumption in
importing countries edged ahead to 73.73m bags from 73.5m bags the previous
year.
However, producer stocks at 46.65m bags and consumer stocks of 19.2m bags
add up to nearly a year's consumption in importing countries.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If trading conditions in wool consuming countries are taken as a guide to
what happens to wool prices when sales are resumed next week, buoyancy would
be very surprising. Information from the UK and Continental Europe indicates
negligible new buying interest, and quite often no great keenness to take up
deliveries where orders have previously been placed. Holidays have been a
major factor. Currency volatility has also injected uncertainties which
cannot always be evaded, and which tend to inhibit buyers who are often for
trade reasons already cautious.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank dashes hopes of imminent cut in
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets rallied yesterday on hopes that the
Bundesbank would cut German interest rates shortly in order to relieve
tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism.
Rumours that the Bundesbank could cut interest rates as early as today at
the central bank's council meeting helped to encourage buying of French and
German government bonds.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, later dashed hopes of
an imminent cut when he told industrialists in Oslo that the Bundesbank
'must continue to give priority in its monetary policies to limiting
inflationary risks'.
French government bond prices rose on the rumours. The French government
bond market has been troubled by speculation that the franc may be devalued
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
On Tuesday, the Bank of France raised its overnight rate to 12 per cent from
10 per cent to curb speculation against the currency, and both the French
and German central banks issued statements stressing their intention to
support the parity between the franc and the D-Mark.
The measures helped to relieve the pressure on the franc, which appeared
relatively stable yesterday. Dealers noted healthy buying interest in the
French government bond market as investors were attracted by the high yield
spreads over German government bonds. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond
due April 2003 moved from 8.12 per cent at the opening to 8.05 per cent by
late afternoon.
Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds edged higher as interest rate
speculation and some gloomy economic forecasts encouraged domestic investors
to buy bunds.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 92.86 and traded in a range of
92.68 to 92.98 before ending the day at 92.96. The yield curve flattened as
the short end of the market outperformed longer-dated issues.
The German Institute for Economic Research, a leading German economic
institute, said the economy would shrink in 1993, and criticised the
Bundesbank for not lowering key interest rates. In addition, the Economics
Ministry said industrial output in west Germany fell 1.1 per cent in
November from October and was down 5.1 per cent from a year earlier. Dealers
said the news led to hopes that the Bundesbank would be forced to ease
interest rates soon.
UK government bond prices closed higher after a volatile day, taking their
cue from the European bond markets. Dealers noted some switching out of
short-dated issues into medium and long-dated gilts.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly firmer after touching new highs,
helped by the combination of continued stock market weakness and investor
buying.
The futures contract climbed from its opening level of 108.41 to a four-year
high of 108.56, before closing at 108.45 in Tokyo. The yield on the
benchmark No 145 opened at 4.505 per cent and moved to 4.475 per cent before
ending at 4.48 per cent.
Dealers said bond market sentiment remains bullish, despite the prospect of
new supply today. The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about
Y800bn of 10-year government bonds. Dealers predicted the coupon would be
the same as for the December issue at 4.8 per cent, and that the auction
will be a reopening of the existing No 153 issue.
US Treasury prices remained trapped in narrow ranges as investors stayed on
the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's employment data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 103
5/16 , yielding 7.343 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 100 7/32 , to yield 4.491 per cent. Trading activity
was light.
Prices eased early, but recovered later amid sporadic buying. Attention
remained fixed on tomorrow's employment report for December - which should
provide the market with a clearer idea of how the economic recovery is
progressing - and on the likely impact on prices of fresh corporate and
government supply due out both this and next week.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it would sell Dollars 9.75bn of new
seven-year notes next Wednesday, slightly less than had been expected.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Currency turmoil drove
trading in futures to new highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST year's currency upheaval helped to drive trading on European futures
markets to new highs at a time when trading in some underlying cash markets
showed only modest growth, according to figures from the continent's futures
exchanges.
The shift of trading to futures markets came largely in the second half of
the year as investors sought to shift their exposure to European markets
quickly during periods of high currency volatil-ity.
'In volatile markets, it is easier to trade one generic security than lots
of underlying ones,' said the head of fixed income futures at one US
investment bank in London. The transparency of pricing on futures exchanges,
compared with the difficulty in times of market upheaval of obtaining firm
quotes for trades in underlying cash bonds, also explains the use of
futures, he said.
As a result, futures prices had a greater impact on prices in cash markets.
'The government cash markets were visibly driven by futures at more times
last year than they had been previously,' said Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of
fixed income research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
He attributed the switch to futures to the large number of investors who
sought to sell futures contracts to hedge their long positions in various
European currencies.
At the same time, many investors wanting to take positions in the European
fixed income markets chose to use futures contracts rather than cash bond to
reduce their exposure to currency movements.
A sharp increase in trading was recorded across all types of contract:
Government bond contracts. Trading in the main French, German and UK
government bond contracts in 1992 was up by around 50 per cent from 1991
levels. Most actively traded was the Matif's 10-year French government bond
contract, which turned over 31m lots, up by 47 per cent. The two German bund
contracts traded on Liffe in London and on the DTB in Frankfurt recorded
18.9m between them (13.6m of these in London), a growth of 52 per cent,
while the long gilt futures contract in London showed a 56 per cent
increase, to 8.8m contracts.
Growth in the cash markets was slower. Turnover in gilts in 1992, at Pounds
1,236bn, was up just over 10 per cent on 1991, although all of this increase
was due to more active trading of short-dated and index-linked gilts.
Turnover in bunds, together with bonds issued by the German rail and post
agencies, was up by around a third.
The Italian government bond contract was the fifth most actively traded
contract in London, after the main sterling and D-Mark contracts, turning
over 3.8m lots.
Short-term interest rate contracts. Turnover grew even faster, with a 154
per cent jump in London's Euromark contract, to 12.2m, and a 115 per cent
jump in Matif's Pibor contract, to 6.4m. The short sterling contract traded
11.3m, up 40 per cent on 1991.
One trader noted the absence of contracts in Europe covering medium-maturity
paper, except for the German Bobl futures contracts. Such contracts would be
of particular use to investors as Europe's yield curves shift from an
inverted to a normal shape, he added.
Equity indices. Trading increased by around a half in the futures on both
the FT-SE 100 and Cac 40 indices, which turned over 2.6m and 3.6m contracts
respectively. Turnover on the Dax index leapt from 1.3m to 3.3m.
In all, Liffe traded 72m futures and options contracts last year compared
with the 55.5m on the French exchange. Although the figures are not directly
comparable, due to different contract sizes, the numbers suggest a
comfortable margin compared with 1991, when both exchanges traded 37m-38m
contracts.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for World Bank's 30-year
global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank's careful preparation for its 30-year global bond paid off as
bankers reported strong positive feedback to the much-awaited Dollars 1.25bn
issue. Bankers say the indicated spread of 28-30 basis points over
comparable US Treasuries is generous, particularly as the bond is
strippable.
Detaching the coupons from the bonds and selling them separately will add
value, they say. Credit Suisse First Boston, joint book-runner with Goldman
Sachs, said the issue was oversubscribed by buyers worldwide. Final pricing
will take place today.
More large-scale activity is being forecast in fixed rate dollars, involving
borrowers with large requirements locking into the low fixed rates
available.
The durability of demand for collared floating rate notes continues to
confound expectations, say bankers, noting that of all the issues so far
this week only the Republic of Austria's has so far broken syndicate.
Austria increased to Dollars 300m the 10-year collared floating rate note
launched at the start of the week, in response to investor demand, said UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, the lead manager.
Salomon Brothers said Nordic Investment Bank's Dollars 100m 10-year issue
offers a slightly higher floor than some recent issues to reflect the
relative trading levels of NIB paper compared with other supranational
borrowers which are more traditionally considered to be retail names.
The run of Canadian dollar issues continued, bringing the total launched
this week to five, worth CDollars 850m. After General Electric Capital
Corp's CDollars 100m five-year 8 per cent issue went well and broke
syndicate quickly, lead manager UBS said the main attraction for the retail
investors targeted was the pricing.
Other bankers agreed the launch spread of 53 basis points looked generous.
It tightened to around 49 basis points towards the end of the day.
Electricite de France's CDollars 200m five-year deal was also attractively
priced, with a launch spread of 45 basis points, said bankers.
There was less certainty about Banque Nationale de Paris, which is tapping
the 10-year area. Lead manager Hambros said it had detected strong retail
demand, but the issue was thought to be moving rather slowly, given investor
preference for five-year paper and for corporate rather than bank names.
Hambros said the majority of the paper was sold, but conceded that the
volume of supply meant investors might find it difficult to choose. This is
BNP's first issue since its debt was downgraded to Aa1 by Moody's Investors
Service last December.
Credit Commercial de France described Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer's
FFr3bn 12-year 8 1/4 per cent domestic bond with warrants as a re-opening of
the French franc sector. It says around 55 per cent of the bonds were
distributed internationally. SNCF also raised SFr300m over 12 years at 5 1/4
per cent through Swiss Bank Corp, representing the lowest coupon achieved
for several years.

PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday extended the
deadline for its ADollars 86m (USDollars 58m) bid for Siddons Ramset, the
Australian hardware and fasteners group, giving substance to speculation
that the offer will soon be increased.
Pacific BBA said the cash and paper offer would remain open until January
27, nearly two weeks after the original deadline. It said that acceptances
had been received for 0.1 per cent of Siddons' stock.
The extention will give Pacific BBA time to consider whether to raise its
ADollars 1.81-a-share offer to match a rival ADollars 2 cash bid by WA
Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US
engineering group. The WA Deutsher bid values Siddons at ADollars 94m.
Mr Roger Flynn, Siddons' managing director, said the company was unsure
whether the extension would lead to an increased offer.

<TEXT>
BANCA del Gottardo, the Lugano-based bank in which Sumitomo Bank of Japan
has a 55 per cent interest, said net profit fell 9 per cent last year to
SFr42m (Dollars 30m) because of increased provisions for bad loans, writes
Ian Rodger.
But the directors described the result as 'satisfactory' in a year of
volatile financial markets and a fresh deterioration of the debt situation
in Switzerland and abroad. They propose to maintain the dividend at SFr20
per share and participation certificate.
Cash-flow rose 13 per cent to SFr125m, due to good results in foreign
exchange, the satisfactory trend of interest margins and an extraordinary
SFr17m dividend from Gotthard Finance International.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: UAL to axe 3,000 jobs in
cost-cutting scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, yesterday announced a
significant cost-cutting plan involving the axing of almost 3,000 jobs, a 5
per cent salary cut for some management, and reducing the company's flight
schedule.
The airline's parent company, UAL, said the measures were aimed at reducing
annual expenses by around Dollars 400m in the hope it can claw its way back
to profitability.
The Chicago-based company suffered an after-tax loss of Dollars 165.9m in
the first nine months of 1992, and warned yesterday it will also post 'a
large fourth-quarter' deficit.
There have been signs of a firmer pricing environment for the US airline
industry recently, and there are hopes the savage fare wars seen in the past
couple of years may be receding. However, Mr Stephen Wolf, United's
chairman, claimed yesterday 'the fundamental flaws in our industry are still
pervasive and threaten our long-term financial health'.
United's action echoes a similar announcement from Delta Air Lines last
month, when its Atlanta-based rival unveiled a pay cut for all non-contract
staff and cut its dividend to a nominal amount.
American Airlines, the third big US carrier, has also warned it expected to
shrink by the mid-1990s and has pruned administrative staff numbers.
All three airlines have slashed planned expenditure plans for new aircraft -
with United announcing in December it was in talks with Boeing to 'reduce
significantly' its 433 aircraft on order and option.
Yesterday's cost-cutting package by United will lead to a 2,800 reduction in
existing job numbers and another 1,900 people will not be hired this year,
as previously planned.
All United officers and affected US management will take a 5 per cent salary
cut, while other employees - in and outside the US - will be asked 'to
participate in similar sacrifices'.
United also said it would accelerate the retirement of its older aircraft,
leading to the grounding of around 40 aircraft in 1993, and reduce
non-aircraft capital expenditure across the board by an unspecified amount.
The airline will also reduce its domestic schedule and cancel plans to fly
certain previously-announced international routes.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Value of cross-border deals up
to Dollars 76.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE global value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions rose by one-third
in 1992, to Dollars 72.6bn from Dollars 54.4bn, according to accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick. This reverses the decline seen in 1991 in value terms,
but the volume of transactions fell for the fourth year in succession, to
1,810.
The EC reinforced its position as the most popular region for takeovers. In
1992, cross-border sales of EC companies grew to Dollars 41.6bn, accounting
for 57 per cent of worldwide cross-border transactions, compared with
Dollars 23.1bn and 42 per cent in 1991.
Most buying was in the UK, where 233 companies were sold to foreign buyers
for Dollars 15.1bn, compared with 269 deals worth Dollars 9.3bn in 1991. The
biggest deal worldwide was Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp's purchase of
Midland Bank, which KPMG valued at Dollars 7.4bn.
Germany and France were the next most popular EC targets for cross-border
buyers, each with deals worth Dollars 6.1bn.
US companies were the most active buyers of foreign companies, spending
Dollars 15.3bn on 342 purchases, compared with Dollars 8.2bn on 333
transactions in 1991. Cross-border sales of US companies fell to 282 deals
worth Dollars 9.7bn, from 422 worth Dollars 19.7bn in 1991.
KPMG forecasts that EC companies will continue to be active in international
mergers and acquisitions. In spite of recent restructuring, many industries
in the EC are still relatively fragmented, according to Mr Richard Agutter,
the firm's head of mergers and acquisitions.
Food and drink manufacturing and distribution, financial services,
telecommunications and leisure-related industries are sectors where he
expects further activity in 1993.
Mr Agutter also expects to see business increasing in the more advanced
former eastern bloc countries. 'Apart from east Germany, we see Poland,
Hungary and the Czech republic as the prime sources of privatisation
opportunities,' he said.
KPMG noted that, in spite of the signs of recovery, the value of deals in
the second half of 1992 was 30 per cent down on the first six months. While
there were more deals over Dollars 1bn in 1992 than in 1991 (10 worth
Dollars 25.7bn compared with two worth Dollars 5.8bn), there were no signs
of a return to the near hysteria which characterised some transactions in
the late 1980s.
Among the negative factors holding back the world economy are, says KPMG,
the continuing failure to conclude the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks,
Germany's move into recession and the fragility of some European currencies
following the exchange rate crises late in the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH American property investors are insisting on tighter safeguards to
avoid a repetition of the acrimony and financial loss which marked last
year's collapse of developer Olympia &amp; York.
The heightened caution among investors is reflected in a pioneering mortgage
bond issue completed recently by two Canadian securities dealers for Les
Terrasses de la Chaudiere, a 1.9m sq ft hotel and also a government office
complex near Ottawa.
The CDollars 135m (USDollars 112.5m) private placement, arranged by RBC
Dominion Securities and Scotia McLeod of Toronto, includes provisions to
ensure the owners of the building cannot hold up or divert rental income
which is required for debt-service payments.
The issue was distributed to about a dozen financial institutions, mostly
North American life insurance companies.
An official at ScotiaMcLeod said the agreement had been made 'as
bullet-proof as possible to ensure that there is no intervening party
between the government (the tenant) and the bondholders.'
Several similar deals are in the pipeline, including a mortgage on a large
new building in Toronto occupied by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
O&amp;Y raised funds for numerous projects in the US and Canada during the 1980s
by setting up 'single-purpose' companies which were supposedly insulated
from any financial problems which might be experienced by the developer.
However, rents were paid to O&amp;Y. Lenders discovered last year the developer
had siphoned cash out of healthy buildings to prop up the troubled parts of
its empire.
Investors in the Chaudiere development, owned by three limited partnerships,
have insisted that rents be paid directly to a trustee, which must
immediately make the required debt-service payments.
As a further safeguard, the trustee is obliged to disclose all information
on the project required by bondholders.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: De Beers' diamond sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND SALES by De Beers of South Africa, which controls 80 per cent of the
world's rough diamond trade, last year fell by 13 per cent to Dollars
3.417bn.
However, De Beers indicated yesterday that its grip on the market was as
tight as ever and that it had achieved its objective of balancing the supply
of rough, or uncut, diamonds with demand. It said rough diamond prices were
'firm', stocks at cutting centres were at 'reasonable levels', as were
traders' bank borrowings.
The diamond sales figures, announced by De Beers' London-based Central
Selling Organisation, were at the top end of analysts' expectations and
this, coupled with the group's estimate that world retail jewellery sales
last year would match the Dollars 39bn-Dollars 40bn in 1991, helped move the
share price up by Pounds  13/32 to Pounds 8 1/16 .
The CSO operates a buffer stock of rough diamonds to keep the market on an
even keel. It not only had to cope with recession in the US and Japan, but
also had to mop up an estimated Dollars 500m-worth of gemstones smuggled out
of Angola last year. This problem ended when the threat of civil war was
renewed in that country, the CSO reported.
De Beers passed on some of the financial pain to producers by cutting their
supply quotas by 25 per cent from September onwards. Nevertheless, analysts
suggested De Beers' finances took a hefty knock defending the diamond market
last year.
Mr Steve Oke, analyst at the Smith New Court financial services group, said
it was likely De Beers' earnings would fall by 30 per cent from the 1991
level and that the dividend would be cut by half.

SHARES in Citic Pacific, the large trading and investment company controlled
by China, were suspended in Hong Kong yesterday amid speculation that it
would make a large capital issue to fund acquisitions.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange said that the company had requested suspension
pending an announcement.
Analysts expect Citic to announce the acquisition from its parent, Citic
Hong Kong, of about 10 per cent of Hongkong Telecom, the colony's
telecommunications monopoly.
Citic Hong Kong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China International Trust and
Investment Corporation of Beijing, owns 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom.
Analysts said that Citic Pacific may also acquire an interest in one of
Citic Hong Kong's power stations in China.
As with past transactions of this type, Citic Pacific is expected to fund
the two acquisitions through the issue of new shares, although this would
require shareholder approval.

PACIFIC BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, yesterday extended the
deadline for its ADollars 86m (USDollars 58m) bid for Siddons Ramset, the
Australian hardware and fasteners group, giving substance to speculation
that the offer will soon be increased.
Pacific BBA said the cash and paper offer would remain open until January
27, nearly two weeks after the original deadline. It said that acceptances
had been received for 0.1 per cent of Siddons' stock.
The extention will give Pacific BBA time to consider whether to raise its
ADollars 1.81-a-share offer to match a rival ADollars 2 cash bid by WA
Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, the US
engineering group.
The WA Deutsher bid values Siddons at ADollars 94m.
Mr Roger Flynn, Siddons' managing director, said the company was unsure
whether the extension would lead to an increased offer.
'They have delayed to allow an extension to the bid, but whether they do or
not will be up to them,' he said.
'The bid is still unacceptably low, and the board stands by its decision to
reject it, particularly in light of the Illinois Tool Works bid.'
The Siddons board is pressing for an offer in line with an independent
assessment by Schroders Australia, which valued the company at between
ADollars 2.60 and ADollars 3.00 a share.
Siddons shares closed 4 cents lower yesterday at ADollars 2.01 in weak
trading on the Australian Stock Exchange.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Troubled Torras names new
executive board

<TEXT>
GROUP TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office,
has named a four-man board to run its troubled industrial empire in Spain.
This fulfils a pledge made to the Madrid government two weeks ago following
the KIO's decision to place Torras in receivership.
Two Kuwaitis, Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, Torras' current deputy chairman, and Mr
Al-Mousherji, were appointed to the new executive committee together with
two Spaniards, Mr Luis Vano, Torras' director general, and Mr Jose Luis
Lopez Sanchez, a lawyer.
The board will replace two partners of the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick who
had been placed in charge of Torras' management after the receivership
application, although both auditing consultants will remain close to the
holding company as administrators of its receivership process.
Spain's industry minister had requested a four-man board last month, equally
composed of Kuwaitis and Spaniards, in order to negotiate Torras' staged
withdrawal from Spain. Although the Madrid administration had hoped a
high-ranking official of the KIO would join the board - both Nr Al-Nouri and
Mr Al-Mousherji are external advisers to the office - the development was
viewed as positive and a prelude to the wind-up talks.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: CS aims to create a giant among
the gnomes - The group's agreed bid for Volksbank would strengthen its home
base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, appears to be creating a
new meaning for the term 'universal bank'.
If its agreed SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.14bn) bid for Swiss Volksbank is
successful, the group will have at least one significant,
independently-branded company for virtually every financial business.
Through this takeover, the CS group - long regarded as the most aggressive
of the big three Swiss banks internationally - would also considerably
strengthen its Swiss base. In terms of assets, it would be slightly larger
than the current number one, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), although not
in profitability.
At the end of June 1992, UBS had total assets of SFr258.8bn, Swiss Bank
Corporation SFr201bn, and CS Holding SFr241bn (of which roughly SFr4bn are
attributable to CS's share in its only non-banking subsidiary, Electrowatt,
an electric utility and engineering group). The Credit Suisse banking group
alone had total assets of SFr163.7bn.
The addition of Volksbank, with its total assets of SFr48.5bn at the end of
June 1992, would appear to put the enlarged CS banking group comfortably
into first place. But CS may want to make large provisions for bad loans and
the costs of rationalisation at Volksbank.
CS's profits, even including those of Volksbank, are still well behind those
of UBS. CS had net income last year of SFr980m and Volksbank SFr68.4m, while
UBS net income was SFr1.2bn.
CS made clear yesterday that, following the takeover of Volksbank, it would
accentuate the specialisation of its financial subsidiaries.
Credit Suisse itself would remain the flagship global bank, concentrating on
international activities, securities underwriting and major corporate and
institutional clients, while CS First Boston would maintain its investment
banking speciality.
These two would fulfil the group's main strategy, which was stated last year
by Mr Rainer Gut, the chairman, as 'building up global wholesale and
investment banking capabilities so that at least one of the group's
companies will be able to service any major banking transaction wherever and
whenever it may arise.'
Volksbank is seen as the group's domestic Swiss business bank, and will shed
its relatively modest international activities and put less emphasis on its
securities business in order to focus on lending to small and medium-sized
companies.
But both Credit Suisse and Volksbank, which will be managed and report
financial results together, will continue to operate retail branch networks
in Switzerland.
Perhaps CS believes it can win in this overcrowded field with a two-brand
strategy, although it may just be hesitant about breaking customer loyalties
for some time.
Bank Leu, active mainly in Swiss markets before CS acquired it in 1990, will
(with other CS subsidiaries) increasingly concentrate on private banking.
While this structure has a pleasing symmetry, analysts doubt that it will
work that way in practice.
Mr Michel Petitpierre, head of research at bankers Pictet &amp; Co in Geneva,
said he expected the group to rationalise aggressively and bring its banking
activities gradually under unified management.
Mr Hans Kaufmann, of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, noted that Credit Suisse
already carried out Bank Leu's data processing.
He said there were more than 100 locations where branches of Volksbank and
Credit Suisse overlapped, and he expected closures to proceed rapidly.
Redundancies among the 6,600 Volksbank staff would occur more slowly, he
added.
Mr Kaufmann predicted that, in the long term, Credit Suisse would probably
move out of retail banking.
CS claimed that the combined forces of Credit Suisse and Volksbank would
take leading market shares in many sectors in Switzerland.
In mortgage lending, for example, it would have a 14.3 per cent share, based
on 1991 figures. That is fractionally larger than those of UBS and Swiss
Bank Corporation, the current number two. Credit Suisse alone has only a 9.5
per cent share.
In clients' deposits, it would also move into first place with a 17.5 per
cent share, compared with 14.3 per cent at UBS and 11.3 per cent at Credit
Suisse now.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pfizer shares hit by court
ruling
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Pfizer fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/8 - about 3.6 per cent -
in active trading yesterday morning on news that a California appeal court
had opened the door to lawsuits from out-of-state recipients of the
company's Shiley heart valve.
Pfizer, one of the fastest-growing US pharmaceutical companies, has been
trying to put the Shiley litigation to rest for several years. About 50,000
people have received the heart valves made by Pfizer's California-based
Shiley unit.
The company had appealed against an earlier California superior court
decision to allow US recipients of Shiley valves to sue in California,
regardless of where they live. That decision has now been upheld by the
appeals court.
It was decided in the earlier ruling that foreign valve recipients did not
have the same constitutional rights to sue in California. Pfizer said it
would now seek relief in the California supreme court on the decision.
Last year, Pfizer put forward a comprehensive plan in a Cincinnati court
which included a Dollars 215m class action settlement and an additional
Dollars 300m in reserves to settle fracture claims. The plan, which was
accepted by the court, has been appealed and is waiting for a federal
appeals court review.
Mr Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said: 'California
courts have an image of being more pro-consumer than other courts. As a
result, Pfizer has been trying to keep Shiley out of California,
particularly for those patients who are not California residents.'
Mr Mehta noted the Cincinnati hearing was more critical 'for the
comprehensive settlement of the Shiley saga. If the Cincinnati settlement is
upheld by the appellate court, then I think Shiley can be thought of as
behind Pfizer even though hundreds of cases are pending'.

<TEXT>
MORGAN GRENFELL has lost the mandate to sell MEH, the state-owned Hungarian
recycling company.
The State Property Agency, Hungary's privatisation authority, announced it
had been unable to reach agreement with the UK merchant bank on fees and was
therefore not renewing the mandate.
The SPA expressed disappointment that two years of work on MEH had produced
no results. Mr Lajos Csepi, SPA managing director, described another Morgan
Grenfell transaction, the privatisation of Nagykanizsa Brewery, as 'a
complete failure.'
Morgan Grenfell confirmed yesterday the two sides had failed to agree, but
blamed conflicts within the Hungarian government for delays in transactions.
Morgan Grenfell's departure comes one month after a similar incident
involving Barclays de Zoete Wedd, another UK investment bank. The SPA sacked
BZW as adviser on the privatisation of Kobanya Brewery, alleging BZW had
ignored important instructions.
Tensions between the Hungarian authorities and western advisers have grown
as privatisation transactions have dragged on. SPA officials feel costs are
out of proportion to the proceeds, while western investment banks are
increasingly unwilling to work for uncertain success fees.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Motorola proceeds with Iridium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOROLA is to proceed with ambitious plans to build Iridium, a Dollars
3.37bn global satellite communications network for which it has been seeking
co-investors.
The US electronics group said it had received subscriptions and letters of
intent from a number of potential investors around the world. 'We are very
pleased with the worldwide interest being expressed in the Iridium
programme,' said Mr John Mitchell, Motorola vice-chairman.
The Iridium telecom-munications network would be designed to use hand-held,
wireless telephones that communicate through a constellation of 66 low-earth
orbit satellites. The network would offer subscribers voice, paging,
facsimile, data and radiodetermination satellite services (RDSS).
Motorola declined to identify its potential Iridium partners, and noted the
commitments were non-binding and subject to conditions, including approval
of certain government agencies and ratification by investors.
For more than two years Motorola has been seeking to establish an
international consortium which will own and operate the Iridium network. It
had set a December 1992 deadline to find funding for the project.
Among the parties reported to have signed letters of intent to acquire
equity stakes in Iridium are the Brazilian government and United
Communications of Thailand. Other companies said to have expressed interest
include DDI and Kyocera of Japan.
Motorola is developing the Iridium system and intends to be an investor in
the consortium and the prime contractor of the system.
Current plans estimate the launch of the satellites would begin in 1996,
with commercial service anticipated for 1998.
However, several regulatory hurdles remain as Motorola competes with other
proposed satellite telephone systems for approval from the US Federal
Communications Commission.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications company, has
formed an alliance with Novell, the leading supplier of computer networking
software, to develop and market products linking computer networks with
telephones.
Products resulting from the joint efforts will 'bring the power of
computer-telephone integration to desktop comp-uters,' the companies said
yesterday.
They aim to help businesses increase office productivity by integrating
existing telephone and computer networks to provide 'telephony services'.
Merged computer-telephone networks will eventually be accessible from all
types of desktop computers, the companies added.
The first product, called a 'telephony server NetWare loadable module', will
link Novell's popular NetWare computer networks with AT&amp;T's Definity
communications systems.
It will allow customers to use common telephone features, such as
auto-dialling, conference calling and message management, in combination
with information stored in their computer networks.
Users will be able to speed-dial numbers and take notes on their computers.
Notes from previous conversations will be available with each new call.
The companies also plan to develop products that integrate services such as
electronic mail, facsimile and voice mail.
Mr Ray Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said: 'Telephony
services are a powerful combination of technologies which will benefit
customers by providing integration between their existing voice and data
networks.
'The technology will simplify management and pave the way for delivery of
many new services.'
Mr Jerre Stead, president of AT&amp;T Global Business Communications Systems,
said: 'The market for computer-telephone integration is expected to almost
double each year during the next five years as customers discover its
productivity benefits. We intend to be leaders in this emerging market.'

Dollars 525m GNA buy

<TEXT>
GE CAPITAL, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric, is
to expand into the wholesale annuity and mutual fund business through the
purchase of GNA Corporation from forest products group Weyerhaeuser for
Dollars 525m in cash.
Weyerhaeuser will assume GNA's outstanding Dollars 225m of borrowings.
GNA writes and markets tax-deferred annuities and wholesales proprietary and
third-party mutual funds through financial services companies, such as
commercial banks and savings and loans.
Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said that GNA was a leader in
'one of the fastest-growing segments of financial services - pre-retirement
savings plans. As ageing baby-boomers augment their retirement savings, this
market could more than double in size before the year 2000.'
For Tacoma-based Weyerhaeuser, the deal is a further stage in the refocusing
of the company. It instituted a wide-ranging 'business improvement plan' in
1989, which involved shedding peripheral assets and raising the financial
returns of its core businesses.
GNA, founded in 1980 and bought by Weyerhaeuser three years later, sold
products last year with a gross value of Dollars 3.2bn. It contributed
Dollars 421m, or about 5 per cent, of Weyerhaeuser's 1991 group revenues.
Weyerhaeuser said yesterday it had not been offering the business around,
but was willing to sell because GE Capital would provide the financial
resources GNA needed to take advantage of its market position. Weyerhaeuser
was not planning to sell its remaining financial services operations, in
mortgage lending and real estate development.
With assets of more than Dollars 80bn, GE Capital is the second-largest
non-bank finance company in the US, with 20 businesses ranging from aircraft
leasing to third-party credit card services. Over the past two years it has
begun a significant expansion into the European and Asian markets.
Mr Patrick Welch, chief executive of GNA, will continue to manage the
company. He said yesterday GE Capital had assured him that the business
would remain an independent, stand-alone operation.
GE Capital declined to comment yesterday on market rumours that it is also
negotiating to buy the loan portfolio of Westinghouse Electric's troubled
financial services arm. Westinghouse announced plans to quit financial
services last November.

<TEXT>
PIERRE Premier, a French property developer, has been forced to cede
FFr3.2bn (Dollars 581m) of its property holdings to its banks in order to
retain its independence.
The Pierre Premier initiative comes as a number of France's most prominent
property companies are struggling. Earlier this week, Mr Michel Pelee
resigned from his eponymous property company and was replaced by Mr Henri
Caro.
Until yesterday's deal, Mr Christian Garrel, chairman and main shareholder
in Pierre Premier, faced the threat of losing control of his company. Pierre
Premier, which has been involved with restoring residential and office
buildings in French city centres, has been badly affected by the property
crisis and needed to find new capital.
Instead of a conventional recapitalisation deal, Pierre Premier has
transfered 19 properties, worth a total of FFr3.2bn and representing 80 per
cent of its portfolio, to its banks.
The problems of the French property sector, particularly in the Paris
region, have worsened in recent months. Average rentals in Paris have fallen
by 20 per cent in the past three years and there is a surplus of available
office space in the city.

before extraordinary items showed a rise of more than 12 per cent from the
Fl 109.9m (Dollars 60.0m) reported in 1991. The profit figure would have
been Fl 4m higher if it had not been for the fall in the dollar. Per-share
results before extraordinaries rose by nearly 9 per cent from Fl 6.47 in
1991, and Wessanen forecast a further, unspecified rise in 1993.

FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Property investors seek tighter
safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH American property investors are insisting on tighter safeguards to
avoid a repetition of the acrimony and financial loss which marked last
year's collapse of developer Olympia &amp; York.
The heightened caution among investors is reflected in a pioneering mortgage
bond issue completed recently by two Canadian securities dealers for Les
Terrasses de la Chaudiere, a 1.9m sq ft hotel and also a government office
complex on the outskirts of Ottawa.
The CDollars 135m (USDollars 112.5m) private placement, arranged by RBC
Dominion Securities and Scotia McLeod of Toronto, includes several
provisions to ensure the owners of the building cannot hold up or divert
rental income which is required for debt-service payments.
The issue was distributed to about a dozen financial institutions, mostly
North American life insurance companies.
An official at ScotiaMcLeod said the agreement had been made 'as
bullet-proof as possible to ensure that there is no intervening party
between the government (the tenant) and the bondholders.'
Several similar deals are in the pipeline, including a mortgage on a large
new building in Toronto occupied by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
O&amp;Y raised funds for numerous projects in the US and Canada during the 1980s
by setting up 'single-purpose' companies which were supposedly insulated
from any financial problems which might be experienced by the developer.
However, rents were paid to O&amp;Y. Lenders discovered last year the developer
had siphoned cash out of healthy buildings to prop up the troubled parts of
its empire.
Investors in the Chaudiere development, owned by three limited partnerships,
have insisted that rents be paid directly to a trustee, which must
immediately make the required debt-service payments.
As a further safeguard, the trustee is obliged to disclose all information
on the project required by bondholders. Existing lenders' permission will
also be required for any further debt secured by the project. In addition,
the bonds amortise over 20 years, with no bullet payment of principal at
final maturity.
Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto has assigned the bonds an AA Low
rating. DBRS said in a recent report the main risk of the Chaudiere project
is that payments may be delayed if the complex is included in a filing for
bankruptcy protection.
However, it concluded that investors have considerably more protection than
was the case in similar O&amp;Y financings.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US buy helps Bespak rise 68% to Pounds
5.01m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expansion in the US reaped rich rewards for Bespak in the half year to
October 30 as the specialist medical equipment manufacturer's pre-tax
profits jumped by 68 per cent, from Pounds 2.98m to Pounds 5.01m.
Turnover rose to Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 16.4m) of which Pounds 10.4m came from
Tenax, the US medical components maker, which Bespak bought for Pounds 32.8m
last March.
The interim dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4p. Earnings per share
improved from 11.1p to 13.2p, but were diluted by last year's Pounds 25.5m
rights issue.
Buying Tenax reduced the group's heavy reliance on its business with Glaxo -
Bespak makes the aerosol valves in inhalers used to project anti-asthma
drugs such as Ventolin - which accounted for 39 per cent of sales in 1991
but only 25 per cent last year.
Mr Alun Wicks, finance director, said the group's absorption of Tenax was
nearly complete and its performance was boosted by demand, growing by about
20 per cent a year, for components used in the burgeoning minimal invasive
surgery market.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Transformed Flextech Pounds 3m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEPARTURE from the oil services business left USM-quoted Flextech showing
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.9m for the half year to September 30.
For the opening half of the previous year the company returned profits of
Pounds 3.9m.
The announcement prompted a 5p fall in the shares to 81p.
However, they had risen sharply since January 1 following speculation on an
imminent deal with BSkyB for paid subscription of The Children's Channel,
which is indirectly 51 per cent owned by Flextech. No deal was announced,
although it has been reported that an agreement has been signed.
Flextech, which in recent years has been shedding its oil investments, has
been transformed into a company with interests in cable and satellite
television. In July it concluded the sale of Expro, its last oil services
subsidiary, to management for Pounds 55m.
The sharp decline in turnover from Pounds 27.9m to Pounds 2.14m and the
lapse into losses reflects the disposal.
Mr Roger Luard, a director, was enthusiastic about the future despite
continued losses at The Children's Channel. This incurred a deficit of more
than Pounds 3m for the whole of last year. The number of cable and satellite
users in the UK alone had grown by 70 and 40 per cent respectively from
October 1991 to October 1992, Mr Luard said. TCC had benefited from the
increase with a 30 per cent rise in overall revenues.
However, the improved performance had been offset by the increased costs of
renting an extra satellite for better and wider transmission.
Mr Luard said the need for an extra satellite, and therefore the additional
costs, would soon be eliminated by the transfer to an alternative Astra
facility.
Flextech's other investments - IVS, which operates local cable franchises,
and HIT, which distributes children's programming - had turned in
encouraging results, Mr Luard said.
The group also announced it intended to change its year-end from end-March
to December 31. It would also review its dividend policy in the light of the
altered business.
Losses per share worked through at 5.86p (earnings 6.34p).

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CUC Intl acquires Leaguestar for Dollars
70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAGUESTAR, the private company which runs the Worldex timeshare exchange
business and a chain of US travel agents, is being bought for Dollars 70m
(Pounds 45.5m) by CUC International, the US computer merchandising group.
The price compares with a value for the company of about Pounds 12m in 1988.
Leaguestar, a venture capital backed business, had originally aimed at a
flotation but found that a higher price could be obtained through a trade
sale.
It was formed in 1988 when TTI, an Isle of Man trustee company which acted
for timeshare companies, was merged with Worldex, with Pounds 6m of backing
from institutions led by Lloyds Development Capital.
As part of the sale to CUC, TTI has been bought by its management for about
Pounds 250,000. Mr James Edmonds and Mr Simon Bowen, who set up Leaguestar,
have sold their stakes and left the group.
Leaguestar's profits have grown rapidly. In 1991 it made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 25.8m. Profits in 1990 were Pounds 2.8m
and in 1989 Pounds 1.2m.
Lloyds Development Capital said it originally invested Pounds 1.5m but had
been repaid just over Pounds 1m, leaving it with an equity stake at a cost
of Pounds 450,000. Under the deal it received Pounds 3.45m for the shares.

PROFITS OF Hollas, the textile, garment importing and mail order group, rose
to Pounds 255,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30.
That marked an improvement of 8.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 235,000 and
came from turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 18.54).
The directors explained that the fall in turnover reflected direct or
commission business replacing conventional sales in the garment importing
division and did not reflect a lower level of overall activity.
The interim dividend is held at 0.6p from same-again earnings of 0.3p.
Mr Tony Lawson, chairman, believed the joint venture with Kleen-e-ze,
announced last October, was a 'substantial' step forward for Hollas.
The shares rose 2p to 16 1/2 p.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Quality Care's Pounds 1.8m beats placing
estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUALITY CARE Homes, the nursing homes operator, saw its share price rise 15p
to 225p yesterday after announcing a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds
781,000 to Pounds 1.84m in the year to October 31.
The figure exceeded the Pounds 1.75m estimate which accompanied the
company's Pounds 4.2m placing and stock market listing in July last year.
The placing price was 136p.
Profits were stated after exceptional costs of Pounds 152,000 related to the
listing.
Turnover was Pounds 6.2m, up 87 per cent on the previous Pounds 3.32m.
Mr Duncan Bannatyne, managing director, said the better than expected
performance had continued in the first two months of the current year.
Occupancy rates had been 98.4 per cent in established homes. Two homes
opened in May and July had filled up faster than expected.
Mr Bannatyne said the company was 'better placed than most to withstand any
competitive pressure on prices' which might result from the change in April
from central to local government funding of nursing care for the elderly.
During the year the number of beds rose from 440 to 540 and a total of 750
is expected by October, with three homes opening and one being extended. The
average capital cost per bed is Pounds 17,500.
Net interest paid in the 12 months was Pounds 458,000 (Pounds 425,000) and
after a 30.1 per cent (34.3 per cent) tax charge, earnings per share rose
from 5.13p to 11.77p, or 12.78p excluding the exceptional charge.
A final dividend of 0.75p is proposed, as forecast. A 0.15p payment was made
prior to the placing. Had QCH been listed for the whole year a total
dividend of 4p would have been paid.
Borrowings were cut to Pounds 2m, 15 per cent of shareholders' funds, from
Pounds 5m at the end of the previous year and Pounds 5.5m at the flotation.
Capital expenditure in the year was Pounds 3.06m, compared to cashflow
generated from operations of Pounds 2.58m.
Mr Bannatyne said gearing would rise this year - the rate depended on the
amount of land bought for development beyond the current year - but would
not exceed 50 per cent.

company

<TEXT>
GT MANAGEMENT, the fund management group, is launching an open-ended
investment company to invest in the debt of emerging markets. It initially
hopes to raise between Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m) and Dollars 40m.
The GT Emerging Markets Bond Fund will be authorised in Dublin and is aimed
at institutional investors in the UK and continental Europe. The launch
period will last from January 11 to January 22, with a minimum subscription
of Dollars 400,000.
Mr Robert Stirling, GT's senior global fixed income fund manager, said the
fund would aim to capitalise on small emerging markets as they removed
barriers to global trade. It plans to have a 40 per cent weighting in Latin
America, with holdings of 8 per cent in Asia, 24.5 per cent in Europe and
27.5 per cent in the Middle East and Africa.
Mr Stirling said the risk was higher than for other government bonds, but
that factors working in favour of emerging markets, such as
anti-inflationary policies and attacks on fiscal deficits, were favourable
for fixed-interest investors.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS Viyella, the textile group, is in talks which could lead to it making
an offer for the 28.2 per cent of Youghal Carpets it does not already own.
However, any offer for the County Cork-based company would probably be 'at a
substantial discount to the current market price' it said.
Youghal's shares were quoted yesterday at 13p, unchanged on the day, but
have risen from 2p recently, a rise which forced the announcement.
Coats made an agreed bid for Youghal in 1987 at 1p a share but a minority of
holders did not accept. At the time of the bid Jaykeel Investments, an
independent investment company based in the Channel Islands, had started to
build a stake in Youghal and now holds 18 per cent.
Youghal has suffered worsening losses in recent years. In 1991 pre-tax
losses were IPounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.88m) and in the first half of 1992 it
lost a further IPounds 2.2m.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stead &amp; Simpson considers buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEAD &amp; SIMPSON, the UK shoe retailer, is considering a buy-out from
Clayform Properties, the property development and investment group which
acquired it for Pounds 120m in 1988.
Rumours have been circulating in the shoe trade that S&amp;S believes it would
be able to operate more effectively and gain greater support from suppliers
if it separated from Clayform, and has been looking for a possible exit for
some months.
The shoe chain reported an increase in operating losses from Pounds 2.7m to
Pounds 3.2m when Clayform announced a half-year pre-tax deficit of Pounds
10.9m last September.
Mr Peter Gee, S&amp;S managing director, said yesterday he could neither confirm
nor deny that a buy-out was planned. 'I can make no comment at the moment.
If we had got something together then we would tell you. We have looked at
all sorts of things.' Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the chartered accountants,
are believed to be working on a deal with S&amp;S but also refused to comment.
Clayform first bid Pounds 89.5m for S&amp;S in 1988, but was defeated despite
raising its bid to Pounds 108m. The company retained a 41 per cent stake and
talks were reopened in May 1989. The two sides reached agreement on a
revised Pounds 120m cash offer the following month.
The acquisition created a heavy debt burden which Clayform found difficult
to service after the fall in property values with the onset of the
recession. Borrowings have, however, been reduced from Pounds 130m to about
Pounds 35m in the last two years.
S&amp;S profits peaked at Pounds 10.9m on turnover of Pounds 90.5m for the year
to March 1989, but has since has fallen into losses.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs push losses at Stanhope Props
to Pounds 215m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL items of Pounds 184m related to write-downs on the company's
property pushed pre-tax losses from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 215m at Stanhope
Properties in the year to June 30.
Net asset value fell from Pounds 391.1m to Pounds 42.2m.
The company has also concluded a refinancing of its bank debt, without which
the asset value decline would have resulted in breaches of loan covenants.
The agreement extends a revolving credit facility of Pounds 160m due for
repayment December 1993 to December 1996. It will be reviewed in 1994.
Interest will be capped for two years.
The share price yesterday fell 6p to 17p.
An extraordinary meeting will be held on January 29 to amend the articles
which restrict borrowings to two and half times the adjusted share capital
and reserves of the group.
The board is proposing a maximum specified amount of Pounds 300m to cover
existing borrowings.
The company has debt of Pounds 220m resulting in an increased interest
charge of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 11.6m).
Last November its banks agreed to a refinancing for its joint venture
company Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (RSD), which built the Broadgate
office complex in the City of London. Its net asset value has fallen from
Pounds 341m to Pounds 103m.
Stanhope's joint venture partner Rosehaugh went into receivership shortly
after the RSD refinancing was agreed.
Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive, said: 'We have tried to be realistic.
With hindsight it would have been better if the board had embarked on a
disposal strategy at an earlier stage in the business cycle.'
Since the year end, RSD has sold three buildings and Stanhope has sold its
building at Knowle Green, Staines.
The board said that the banks' support would enable it to undertake a
measured debt reduction programme over the medium term, in line with an
expected improvement in property values.
Turnover increased to Pounds 56.9m (Pounds 42.9m).
Annual costs have fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 8m. The number of
employees at the end of June was 83, but has since been reduced to 42.
Losses per share rose to 128.6p (40.09p). There is no dividend.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape invests Pounds 10m to expand Oman
motor side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, has expanded its motor
import and distribution operations in the Middle East.
It has bought a 49 per cent beneficial interest in Towell Auto Centre, which
has exclusive import and distribution rights for Mazda in Oman, for OR5.6m
(Pounds 9.6m).
It is paying WJ Towell, TAC's owner, Pounds 8.4m cash on completion and the
balance in equal chunks over three years.
Inchcape will manage TAC, which has a 7 per cent share of the car market in
Oman, selling 2,100 cars a year.
In addition, TAC distributes Castrol lubricants, Lucas parts and Suzuki
motorcycles in the Sultanate.
Mr Derek Whittaker, a director, said: 'Inchcape has a long-standing
relationship with Mazda.
'It is the exclusive importer and distributor of Mazda vehicles in France,
Hong Kong and Finland, has a 40 per cent share of the Mazda UK import and
distribution business and 50 per cent of the joint venture which markets
Mazda vehicles in South China.'
He added that Inchcape already had a number of joint ventures in Oman with
WJ Towell, which will control the remaining 51 per cent of TAC.
In March 1992, Inchcape bought TKM, funded by a Pounds 376m rights issue.
It now sells more than 350,000 vehicles a year in 26 countries.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wassall keeps its options open on Evode bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wassall, the mini-conglom-erate, yesterday gave itself the option of
increasing its Pounds 113.2m final offer for Evode, the chemicals and
plastics group, by withdrawing its recent statement in which it said its bid
would not be increased.
The Wassall board said this decision was taken following the competitive
situation which arose as a result of the announcement by Laporte, the UK's
second largest quoted chemicals group, that it was close to making a
recommended bid above Pounds 1 a share for Evode.
The news took Wassall by surprise. It had just announced its final offer of
95.2p a share.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac restructures housebuilding side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday unveiled details of a
restruc-turing which will mean the loss of 273 jobs from its 3,000-strong
housing division and reduce the size of its housebuilding operation by 20
per cent.
The group said it planned to shut four of its 20 operating units in the
south of England and the Midlands. It also said it planned to reduce the
number of sites and show homes, which adversely affect costs. The overall
target was to cut working capital by Pounds 100m and sharply reduce
overheads.
Analysts are estimating an overall reduction of Pounds 18m in overheads to
Pounds 54m, and working capital this year of less than Pounds 300m.
Mr Sean Bruen of Tarmac said the group aimed to sell just 7,000 homes in
1993, compared with last year's 8,000. The sales in 1992 had been achieved
on a total of 350 sites.
This was too high a ratio of homes to sites, he said. In 1988, for example,
Tarmac had sold more than 12,000 homes from just 270 sites.
The group also announced the intended sale of its joinery business, the 11th
of 19 planned disposals. Since announcing the disposal programme last
spring, Tarmac has sold 10 businesses, for a total of Pounds 150m.
The restructuring plan had been announced at the time of the interim results
in September, when the group warned of heavy provisions due to property
writedowns for the full year.
Analysts said the actions had been expected, although some suggested
yesterday's details might even dampen the per-sistent bid rumours which have
plagued Tarmac for some time.
'The window of opportunity for a bid was in September,' said one analyst.
'This announcement puts flesh on the restructuring.'
The housing division, which fuelled Tarmac's rapid growth in the boom years
of the 1980s, has been blamed for the group's falling profits in the past
two years. Analysts are expecting after tax losses of as much as Pounds 250m
for the year ended December 31.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Storm clouds facing tour bosses - Airtours'
hostile bid for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAYMAKERS heading for the sun this summer may never notice the
difference. But their tour operators are likely to be in the midst of one of
the most fundamental shake-ups in the holiday industry since Harry Goodman's
International Leisure Group crashed in 1991.
Yesterday, Airtours, the UK's third largest tour operator, launched its much
flagged hostile bid for Owners Abroad, the number two in the industry.
Should the deal go through, the enlarged Airtours will have nearly as large
a share of the UK market as Thomson, the dominant market leader for much of
the last decade.
Apart from any regulatory hurdles on competition grounds, the main obstacles
to this being a straightforward takeover battle is the presence of Thomas
Cook, once a subsidiary of Midland Bank but now controlled by Westdeutsche
Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based state bank.
Last month, Owners Abroad and Thomas Cook agreed a tie-up which would give
Thomas Cook a 10.3 per cent stake in Owners.
The German-controlled company said its wanted to be a part of Owners' plan
to develop a pan-European travel company.
In return, Owners would get access to the well known brand name for
marketing purposes and increased access to the extensive Thomas Cook chain
of retail outlets.
All eyes are, therefore, on WestLB, LTU, the rapidly growing German tour
operator in which the bank has a 34 per cent stake, and Thomas Cook.
'There is a big difference between putting Pounds 237m in a bid and what
they (the Germans) are proposing,' said Mr David Crossland, chairman of
Airtours. 'Are they really that serious or do they just want a tricky
arrangement.'
The proposed deal was not good for Owners' shareholders, when compared with
the benefits of accepting the Airtours share offer, he said.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners chairman, said yesterday that he still believed in
the commercial logic of the deal with Thomas Cook and that the Airtours
offer undervalued the benefits of the tie-up.
'The Thomas Cook deal is right for Owners shareholders; we are fully
committed and Cooks and LTU and Westdeutsche are fully committed,' he said.
'We believe it is a better deal.'
But there is little doubt that should WestLB and Thomas Cook want to push
through with the alliance, Owners shareholders may require a rather sweeter
deal to be put to them if they are not to be tempted by an Airtours offer.
That is not to say that Airtours offer is a knockout blow. The offer, worth
Pounds 221m at yesterday's close, represents a substantial discount to the
market's prospective earnings multiple. As one City observer said yesterday:
'The price does look a bit mean if Airtours is gaining control and doubling
its market share.'
But there again, Airtours boasts a substantially glossier track record.
In the five years since Mr Crossland floated Airtours, with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 27m, earnings per share have grown at a compound
annual rate of 59 per cent and market share in tour operations has grown
from 4 per cent to about 13 per cent, much of it at Thomson's expense. In
1990 and 1991, Airtours was among the fastest growing stocks in the London
market and now has a market capitalisation of nearly Pounds 300m after
issuing only Pounds 17m of new shares.
By comparison, Owners Abroad has not shone. In particular, it missed its
footing in the early marketting of its 1992 holidays, believing the market
would sustain a price increase, and did not take as much advantage of the
ILG collapse.
While Airtours' profits in the year to September last year rose 33 per cent
and sales grew 40 per cent, Owners' profits fell nearly 20 per cent on sales
that grew only half as quickly. In the real acid test for shareholders,
Owners' earnings grew only 6 per cent on a compound basis over the last five
years.
In announcing its deal with Thomas Cook, Owners said it would benefit from
Pounds 7m of cost savings in the first year of the tie-up.
Airtours said yesterday that its savings from a merger would be
significantly in excess of this. Mr Crossland said their combined marketing
operations would benefit as Owners was stronger in the south of England
while Airtours was stronger in the north and in Scotland.
The combined group would also be in a far stronger position in the buying of
40m bed nights a year in Europe - it did not take a calculator to see what
impact a 10p per bed saving would have on profits, Mr Crossland said. And
finally, Airtours would reduce what it sees as a confusing number of Owners
holiday brands.
Ultimately, Owners seems likely to maintain its independence if it can
convince shareholders that the commercial logic of developing a pan-European
holiday company is worth more than Airtours offer.
Potential shareholders in an enlarged group should remember, however, that
Thomson may well try to defend its relative market position by initiating
yet another price war.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Bankers force Lilley into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLEY, the UK contracting and construction group, last night asked to be
put in receivership, after a financial rescue package failed to obtain the
unanimous support of its bankers.
The Glasgow-based group, which employs 2,800 people, said that like many
other companies it had experienced very difficult conditions in its core
construction activities and had been over-exposed to property development.
Lilley recently announced a plan to reschedule its debts, inject Pounds
12.5m of new equity and in October appointed Mr James Hann to replace Mr
Robert Rankin as group chief executive.
Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said: 'Lilley is not alone among construction
companies in having moved into property in the eighties: indeed this was the
motivation of the Pounds 28m management buy-in of August 1988, headed by the
former chief executive.
'It is unfortunate the policies he spearheaded were pursued too long against
a changing economic background. The board addressed this situation and a
change of management produced a feasible way forward. I deeply regret that
the requirement for unanimity among the banks has frustrated this, despite
support from a broad front of investors and lenders.'
Lilley was founded in Scotland in 1918, and became a publicly-quoted company
in 1965. It grew to be one of the UK's biggest construction and civil
engineering groups, specialising in public works, the construction of
pipelines, water and sewerage treatment plants and tunnelling.
During the seventies it specialised in construction at oil and gas
terminals.
Lilley recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.05m in the six months
to June 30 on sales of Pounds 156m. In 1991, losses in housebuilding and
property development caused pre-tax losses of Pounds 5m on turnover of
Pounds 340m, compared with profits of Pounds 14.1m.
At its last year-end, Lilley had net borrowings of Pounds 30m. The shares
closed, before the announcement, unchanged at 7 3/4 p, giving the group a
market value of Pounds 16m.
Lilley Construction Scotland, MDW, Eden Construction and Robinson and
Davidson operate mainly in Scotland and the north of England; Lilley
Construction Midlands, Standen Construction and Piper Buildings in the
Midlands; and Lilley Construction Southern, Henry Jones Construction and
Hatfield Construction in the south of England.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Chesterfield reduces debt after Pounds 85m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHESTERFIELD Properties, a UK property company, yesterday announced the sale
of a building in London's Oxford Street for Pounds 85m to an overseas
investor.
The deal was the latest in a series of large acquisitions by foreign buyers,
which have given new momentum to the depressed London commercial property
market.
The deal, which sent Chesterfield's share price up 32p to 230p, will reduce
its net debt by Pounds 66m and nearly halve its gearing, which previously
stood at 200 per cent.
The sale price is 18 per cent less than the building's book value at the end
of 1991, but compares with a purchase price of Pounds 47m in 1987.
The buyer was Arrowhead Properties, a Jersey-registered private company
owned by an unnamed overseas investor. The sale was made by Anfield
Properties, which is 60 per cent owned by Chesterfield and 40 per cent owned
by Capital &amp; City Holdings, another property company.
Mr Mark Houslop of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnock, Arrowfield's property
adviser, said its client was attracted by the high yield of just over 10 per
cent and its long leases, which do not expire for another 20 years.
The high yield reflects poor prospects for rental growth. The rent paid on
the offices are between Pounds 40 and Pounds 43 per sq ft, which is roughly
double the rent a new tenant would pay.
The building, called United Kingdom House, has four shops and 160,000 sq ft
of offices.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Secured bonds to be repaid at discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Provincial, the West End property company, yesterday asked holders
of debentures, or secured bonds, to take a loss on their investment in what
would amount to the first failure in the debenture market since the 1970s.
The company will offer Pounds 95 for every Pounds 100 of bonds to the 76
insurance companies and pension funds which hold its Pounds 135m of
debentures. The move followed a halving in value since June 1990 of the
company's office and retail property investments in exclusive parts of
London.
Experts in the debenture market were hard-pressed yesterday to recall when a
secured bond issue last failed to repay at face value, although some pointed
to Mitchell Construction, whose bonds went into default nearly 20 years ago.
Companies that issue debentures - typically property companies - agree to
provide security worth substantially more than the value of the bonds,
giving investors a cushion against any fall in property prices.
London &amp; Provincial was due to make an interest payment to its bond holders
of Pounds 5m net of tax yesterday, but would have been unable to do so
without the support of its banker, Citibank. Instead, the company said it
was proposing to pay off the bonds at below face value, together with all
accrued interest, with facilities provided by the US bank.
The deal, if accepted by at least 75 per cent of the bond holders at an
extraordinary general meeting on February 1, will lead to Citibank putting
up Pounds 134m, on top of Pounds 7.7m it has already lent the company. In
addition, the bank has lent Pounds 216m to other parts of the Randsworth
Acquisition group, owner of London &amp; Provincial and itself in receivership.
Although yesterday's announcement brought grumbles from a number of
investors, the offer was better than most had expected.
The latest valuation of the properties backing the bonds shows them to be
worth Pounds 121m, with a further Pounds 22m in cash available to the
bondholders.
The offer has already been informally accepted by three insurance companies,
Prudential, Standard Life and Scottish Amicable, which between them own
Pounds 45m of the bonds.

FT  07 JAN 93 / CS details bid for Volksbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, is set to become
Switzerland's largest banking group in terms of assets following completion
of its agreed SFr1.6bn (Pounds 702m) bid for Swiss Volksbank.
CS is offering three of its registered shares for each SFr500 nominal
capital of the troubled Volksbank, which has been hurt in the past couple of
years by the slump in Swiss property prices and the depressed business
climate.
Mr Walter Ruegg, Volksbank chairman, said trading conditions deteriorated
last autumn just after the bank had set a rationalisation strategy, so the
board decided the best solution was to seek a strong partner.
Mr Rainer Gut, CS president, said the group was determined to maintain a
sufficient presence in its home market and, in particular, a dominant
position in the retail sector.
The takeover plan was welcomed by Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss
National Bank, as a step towards eliminating excessive capacity in Swiss
banking. According to a study by consultants McKinsey, one in every 67 Swiss
inhabitants is a bank branch employee. This compares with one in every 102
people in the UK.
Mr Gut was vague about rationalisation plans, saying only that 'disagreeable
measures are sometimes inevitable'. Analysts said branches of the two banks
overlapped in more than 100 locations.
Investors were unenthusiastic about the deal, and CS Holding bearer shares
fell from SFr2,170 on Monday before the group indicated its interest, to
SFr1,980 at yesterday's close. Analysts said the issue of shares to pay for
the takeover would dilute CS earnings this year by about 10 per cent. On the
other hand, the purchase price discount to Volksbank's net asset value of
SFr2.2bn would boost CS equity.
Both CS and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's largest bank, had
been invited by Volksbank last month to submit takeover bids. The Volksbank
board met on Tuesday to consider them after suspending trading in its shares
on Monday.
Volksbank must achieve shareholders' approval in March to convert itself
from a co-operative into a joint stock company.

FT  07 JAN 93 / GA announces higher payouts on 25-year endowment policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Accident, the composite insurance group, yesterday announced the
highest payouts so far this year for 25-year with-profits endowment
policies.
Several life offices this week announced cuts in the bonuses they pay to
policyholders, but GA increased its 25-year payout by 0.3 per cent to Pounds
65,464, using the standard industry assumption that policies are started by
a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month.
It altered its bonus structure in a way which reduced payouts for
shorter-term policies while increasing them for longer-term endowments.
This led to a cut in payout on 10-year policies of 6.2 per cent to Pounds
6,590, using the above assumptions. Norwich Union cut similar payouts 7.2
per cent to Pounds 6,992, but Sun Alliance cut its 10-year payout by almost
15 per cent to Pounds 6,005, the lowest so far announced.
Mr David Heslop, GA Life's marketing manager, said: 'Last year was actually
a very good year. We estimate the return on our fund for 1992 at around 18
per cent. In those circumstances we did not see any reason why we should
have to adjust our long-term maturity values.'
GA claims it has reached its current position because it conserved its
financial strength during the years of strong investment performance in the
mid-1980s, and did not 'strive to be one of the very top players'.
Several actuaries claim that payouts, particularly for short-term policies,
were too high for 1990, when the stock market dropped during the year. Many
firms assumed this was a aberration and raised payouts. For 10-year policies
this means that payouts on policies exceed the share of the fund's assets
allocated to them.
Mr Philip Scott, investment manager of Norwich Union, said that payouts for
NU exceeded their asset share by 'about 10 per cent', but he pointed out
that the figure was dependent on volatile stock markets.
Mr Charles Cannon, of actuaries Mercer Fraser, calculates that across the
industry, payouts on short-term contracts exceed their asset share by
between 10 and 20 per cent. GA admits its payouts are slightly in excess of
their asset share. Sun Alliance says its payouts are now fully backed by
assets.

FT  07 JAN 93 / UK property becomes the des res of foreign funds: Vanessa
Houlder reports on a spate of overseas investment in commercial buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The claim that the UK commercial property market is at a turning point gains
a certain credibility when sellers believe they are making disposals at the
bottom of the market.
'I suspect we did it at exactly the wrong time,' says Mr Roger Wingate,
chairman of Chesterfield Properties, which has been selling property to
reduce its borrowing. 'The changes that we would need to see in order for
the market to improve are starting to happen.'
The most striking of these changes is the emergence of buyers, mainly from
overseas, which are prepared to invest in UK property. The number of deals
has gathered pace since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism and
interest rates fell 3 percentage points.
Last year's investment by overseas buyers was more than Pounds 1bn. German
funds led the way, with some large acquisitions of buildings in the City of
London in the last quarter of 1992. These included DGI's acquisition of
Ropemaker Place for about Pounds 75m; DIFA's acquisition of Finsbury Circus
from MEPC, a UK property company, for Pounds 73m; and a Pounds 78m
acquisition of Plumtree Court by BfG Immobilien, from Norwich Union.
The increased investment activity is even allowing agents to claim that the
supply of good quality property is running out. 'From an investor's
perspective, there is quite a serious shortage of good investment
opportunities,' says Mr Stephen Mallen of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the
chartered surveyors.
An important reason for the increased activity is that interest rates have
fallen to well below property yields, which allows deals to be
self-financing. The devaluation of sterling has also made UK property
attractive to overseas investors.
But the overriding incentive to invest in UK property is the belief that
values have fallen far enough. Property yields are now well above gilt
yields, a situation unknown since the 1960s; and they are virtually double
equity yields. UK property yields are higher than in many other markets
which encourages buyers to believe that UK property values are coming to the
bottom of their cycle, while other European markets have only started their
decline.
However, the increased interest in UK property is directed at a small group
of properties, with long leases and secure tenants, which accounts for, at
most, a fifth of the market. Moreover, there are strong arguments for
believing that investors are misjudging the severity of the problems of the
UK market.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker, says property values will continue to
decline until the middle of 1994. It says prices will be depressed by the
likely rise in long-dated gilt yields, the large volumes of property that
are due to come on to the market and the banks' reluctance to make further
loans to property investors. Also, the weakness of the economy and the
record oversupply of offices in London, mean rental values will continue to
fall.
The disastrous record of foreign investors who had previously invested in
London might be another cause for caution. The late 1980s saw many overseas
buyers invest at the peak of the market, as restrictions on institutional
investment were lifted. North American investors have also been deterred by
the experience of Olympia &amp; York at Canary Wharf and the losses made by JMB,
a US fund which bought Randsworth, a London property company that later went
into receivership.
Kleinwort Benson, the broker, believes the new wave of overseas investors
will be as transitory as the last. The influx of overseas investors will dry
up once they realise they have overestimated future growth prospects in the
UK, it says. 'The risk is that once these large purchases are completed,
German funds will have their weighting in London and, as the German economy
and property markets deteriorate in the next two years, funds will no longer
be available for overseas purchases.'
It may be that the real significance of the current spate of overseas
purchases is that it provides a selling opportunity for overstretched
domestic investors, rather than indicating the end of the UK property crash.

FT  07 JAN 93 / TSB Bank union calls one-day strike tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL one-day strike by workers at the retail branches and computer
centres of TSB Bank, England's fifth largest bank, will go ahead tomorrow,
after talks broke down yesterday.
Bifu, the banking, insurance and finance union, forecast large-scale support
for the strike at the 1,400 branches but TSB said it was unlikely that
branches would close. TSB said it would do everything possible to minimise
disruption to customers.
Fewer than a third of employees are likely to be involved in the action. Of
Bifu's 19,000 members in the banking side of TSB - of a total of 25,000
employees - 10,000 voted in the ballot, with 7,000 in favour of strike
action. White collar employees generally are more likely than manual workers
to cross picket lines.
Bifu has been negotiating with TSB for the past two years over a large
restructuring programme that has involved the loss of about 5,000 jobs.
However, talks at Acas, the arbitration, conciliation and advisory service,
broke down after TSB refused to guarantee no compulsory redundancies among
the further 1,000 job losses. TSB said yesterday: 'The vast majority of the
losses should be voluntary but we can make no guarantees to Bifu.'
Bifu is in a stronger position at TSB than at other banks because it has a
greater percentage of members among the workforce than at National
Westminster, Barclays and Lloyds Bank, where there are staff organisations.
Most of the thousands of redundancies in the banking sector have been
achieved by voluntary means. The recent threat of compulsory redundancies at
a time of acceleration of job cuts at other banks has caused concern among
staff associations. In November, Barclays' group staff union said they
'would not remain impassive' if there were compulsory redundancies.
Bifu intends to follow tomorrow's strike with a rolling programme of
selective walkouts around the country.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Scanlon admits damage caused by unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABUSE of union power did more to destroy the British car industry than
any other factor, according to Lord Scanlon, one of the men most associated
with that power in the 1960s and 1970s.
As Mr Hugh Scanlon, he was a leftwing champion of the shop stewards movement
in the 1960s and president of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers
for the 11 years up to 1978 during which the car industry was plagued by
industrial strife.
Interviewed for a BBC Radio series The Brothers, about the unions since
1945, Lord Scanlon, 79, said his ideal had been a publicly owned,
British-based, car industry. But he conceded: 'Our actions probably did more
to hold back that ideal than any other single factor.'
Asked if that was because of too many unofficial stoppages, he added: 'Yes,
and on trivial things too. It's not easy for me to say this but in looking
back you can see just how much damage was done.' Until now, Lord Scanlon has
generally emphasised poor management and lack of investment for the
industry's failure.
Reacting to the programme, Sir Michael Edwardes, a former chairman of
British Leyland, where some of the worst disruption took place, said: 'Hugh
has told the truth and proved he's a big man. But his comments do not
surprise me, he was saying similar things in private in the late 1970s.'
In 1977, the year Sir Michael took over at British Leyland, 33m man hours
were lost in strike action and the principles of 'mutuality' and 'status
quo' meant that no changes in working practices could be made without the
consent of the unions.
Mr Geoff Armstrong, employee relations manager at British Leyland between
1979 and 1984, called Lord Scanlon's comments a 'significant recantation'.
However, Mr Armstrong, who was responsible for sacking the leading shop
steward at the Longbridge plant, Mr Derek 'Red Robbo' Robinson, said the car
industry's management was equally to blame.
'I think his comments place too much of the blame on the unions; the
management was also failing to think strategically about customer choice and
foreign competition,' he said.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Allies deliver ultimatum to Iraq over no-fly zone: Deadline
of 48 hours for removal of missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, France and Britain delivered an ultimatum to Iraq yesterday
demanding that it withdraw its anti-aircraft missiles and radar from the
protective zone set up by the United Nations in the south of the country.
The Gulf war allies, backed by Russia, issued their demand to Mr Nizar
Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations, yesterday evening,
insisting on the removal of the batteries within 48 hours.
Iraq was told the allies would 'respond appropriately and decisively' if it
failed to comply.
President George Bush briefed congressional leaders on the latest battle of
wills with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and White House officials said
the US was considering 'various options' for enforcing the UN resolutions
against Iraq.
Allied officials have been in close consultations over the past 10 days
since US fighters shot down an Iraqi aircraft which had encroached on the
no-fly zone established by the UN in August south of the 32nd parallel to
protect the Shia population.
Pentagon officials said Iraq had been moving missiles along the 32nd
parallel - not in itself prohibited by the UN resolutions - and 'teasing the
line' by flying near or just into the the no-fly zone. They said they could
not confirm any incidents of allied aircraft being 'painted', or targeted by
anti-aircraft radar.
Mr Bob Hall, a Defence Department spokesman, said 'painting' would be
regarded as putting US pilots at risk, and would not be tolerated. 'We have
made it very clear to the Iraqis that we are determined to enforce the
no-fly zones, we will enforce the no-fly zones, we will do it in the safest
possible way for our pilots and we will not allow them to be put at risk,'
he said.
Mr Hall said no significant activity had been observed in the no-fly zone
established north of the 36th parallel to protect the Kurdish population.
The test of wills between Iraq and the west is the latest in a sequence of
confrontations since Mr Saddam capitulated to the UN's ceasefire conditions
at the end of Operation Desert Storm.
So far, Mr Saddam has backed down after pushing the western allies to the
brink, in a pattern that US diplomats describe as 'cheat and retreat'.
In April, US, French and British diplomats issued an ultimatum to Iraq's UN
ambassador demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries from
the northern no-fly zone after battery radars had 'painted' allied aircraft.
In July, the allies again threatened a military strike in a showdown over Mr
Saddam's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors access to the agriculture
ministry in Baghdad, believed to house documents on Iraq's ballistic missile
programme.
It is not clear whether the movement of missiles is an attempt to test the
resolve of the incoming administration of Mr Bill Clinton.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: London &amp; Provincial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK mortgage debenture market took heart from yesterday's deal allowing
holders of the Pounds 135m London &amp; Provincial Shop Centres issue to exit
for 95p in the pound. That was much more than many had expected, but it
would be rash to conclude that a similar outcome awaits investors in any
future defaults. The size of the payment to stockholders depended on the
skill and determination of large institutions in negotiating with Citibank,
the company's main banker.
Citibank is acquiring the mortgage property at less than its 'willing buyer'
valuation but it is taking substantial additional risk. It could hardly
recover the price if it were compelled to sell in today's depressed market.
Other bankers in a similar position will see in yesterday's market relief a
good reason for being less generous.
The true lessons from London &amp; Provincial are, first, that defaults can
happen and, second, that better arrangements are needed to protect
stockholders when the value of the security starts to fall. Law Debenture
Trust, the trustee in this case, has been far too passive. It argues that an
earlier valuation of security would not have been in stockholders' interest,
because it might have led to a receivership. But its concept of stockholder
interests is a subjective one, resting heavily on confidential exchanges of
information with the borrower. Trustees need a better defined role giving
them clout and the obligation to exercise it if they are to help make the
market a safer place.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental European companies have long adjusted their accounts to show a
steady growth in reported earnings. The absence of hidden reserves in the UK
may limit the scope for smoothing, but not the desire. Until they were
curtailed by the Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS3), management latitude
to classify items as exceptional or extraordinary left opportunities to
massage earnings figures.
According to research by Vivien Beattie of the University of Southampton and
others, due to be published soon in the Journal of Business Finance,
particular types of companies have a weakness for smoothing. Those with
volatile earnings try to even out the figures to make their profits appear
more consistent and thus more highly valued by the market. If dividend cover
is low, smoothing may help generate the impression that the payment can be
maintained. And while managers with options might be thought to favour share
price volatility, their interest is better served by a smoothly rising share
price and high market rating. Ownership and control are also important. If
the shares are widely spread, managers are tempted to smooth and improve the
company's rating. Only when management owns a substantial equity stake does
the habit die out.
All of this is driven by the desire to remain in control and get richer.
Interestingly, although incentives such as share options are intended to
identify managers interests more closely with shareholders, they may not be
effective; managers seem to account differently when they actually are
owners. And if self-interest is one determinant of accounting policy, the
drive to smooth earnings is unlikely to be stopped by FRS3. The methods,
though, may get more crafty.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: CS/Swiss Volksbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding's offer for Swiss Volksbank has echoes of Lloyds Bank's ill-fated
bid for Midland. The difference is that CS has the support of the national
authorities, but the principle is the same - that rich pickings should
accrue to those who can rationalise a domestic retail network in an
overbanked market. Since CS is likely to carry off Volksbank at a discount
of nearly 30 per cent to stated book value, it seems on to an
extraordinarily good thing.
The doubts begin with uncertainty about the quality of Volksbank's loan
book. Volksbank was not only caught out unexpectedly last year with a
Dollars 73m exposure to the Maxwell empire. It is also heavily exposed to
small and medium-sized companies which have been particularly hit by
recession. If the bank is cheap, that may be because of substantial
provisions to come. Besides, the rationalisation could be slow, expensive
and painful in a country facing high unemployment for the first time in
generations.
The acquisition could thus be heavily dilutive, although the additional
Swiss assets may help offset the impact of the rising dollar on CS capital
ratios. In the longer term the benefits of eliminating a large player in the
local market will also accrue to the other two top banks which will not have
faced any of the costs.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Air raid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours has established a reputation as a highly efficient tour operator
which has successfully developed its business by means of solid, organic
growth. So it seems odd the company should depart so sharply from past
practice by launching a large hostile bid. The argument is that acquisition
of Owners Abroad would represent an unrepeatable leap in Airtours'
development. It would double Airtours' market share, provide a geographical
fit and yield substantial economies of scale. Coincidentally or not, it
would also forestall the emergence of a formidable adversary by wrecking the
proposed alliance between Owners and the German LTU Group.
But despite the obvious attractions, it is easy to see why the market
wobbled when considering the implications of the bid. Airtours is offering
only 10 times Owners' earnings and will probably have to raise its offer to
succeed, increasing the financial risks. If the bid succeeds, the aspiring
upstart can also expect to fly into considerable turbulence created by
Thomson. The industry leader's habit of launching aggressive price wars to
defend its market share would hit the expanded Airtours at a particularly
sensitive time.
There is also the ticklish question of the competition authorities. They may
conclude that two strong competitors would benefit consumers. Equally, they
may balk at Thomson and Airtours controlling 60 per cent of the market. In
short, the deal represents a big, if calculated, gamble in a sector notably
harsh on losers. Airtours still has some convincing to do that it has
correctly calculated the odds.

Why on earth wasn't London's Aldwych tube station closed before now if only
450 people a day were using it?
London Underground says it cost more than Pounds 200,000 a year to operate
the station and the spur line from Holborn, and yet the station only took
Pounds 53,000 a year in ticket sales. Leaving aside the fact that most
tickets would have been sold whether or not this particular station was
open, it seems that London Underground was happy to bear the losses.
A fleet of taxis could have conveyed the regulars the few hundred metres
down Kingsway more cheaply and probably more quickly, too. If London
Underground knew that these were the costs, why did they wait until the
present funding crisis to end this ludicrous subsidy to a few office workers
in the Temple and Covent Garden?
Sir Wilfrid Newton, the Underground's newly knighted chairman, has some
explaining to do.

So you want some venture capital? Knowing what not to do when seeking help
from a venture capitalist can be as important as knowing what to do,
according to Gresham Trust boss Trevor Jones, who has compiled his own handy
checklist.
You do not: ask your accountant to write the business plan; omit the last
set of audited accounts; forget to put in the management team's CVs; tell
the venture capitalist the terms you think he should offer; refuse to invest
in the business you run; talk about how much equity you are prepared to
'give away'; forget to say how much money you need and why; and assume all
investors want an exit in five years.
Observer offers Pounds 25 of 'seed capital' for an entrepreneur who can
suggest the seven best ways to persuade a venture capitalist to back you.

Hard to believe, but Lancashire seems set to become the holiday capital of
Britain. Admittedly, Blackpool doesn't attract the trippers like it used to,
and Southport and Morecambe have seen better days. But when it comes to
organising the holiday business, Lancashire is where it's all happening.
Airtours' Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad is just the latest example.
David Crossland, Airtours' 46-year-old chairman who works out of a
refurbished mill near Pendle Hill, left school with hardly an O level to his
name. Today, he is worth over Pounds 100m and carving up the package holiday
industry in much the same way as the cotton magnates of yesteryear used to
divide up the empire.
A few miles down the road at Chorley, Trevor Hemmings runs Scottish &amp;
Newcastle's fast-growing leisure division which owns Center Parcs and
Pontins. Hemmings started as a builder's apprentice in Leyland and is now
worth over Pounds 100m, tied up mainly in S&amp;N shares he took when he sold
Pontins.
Richard Atkinson, founder of Manchester's Eurocamp, is not yet as wealthy as
the other two but then he started later.
So what's the secret? Crossland, anxious not to be compared with fallen
leisure superstars, like Sir Freddy Laker or Harry Goodman, stresses that
unlike them he has 'stuck to his last' and brought in professional managers.
Anything else? 'It's a lot colder up there,' jokes Crossland.

Proof that the Bundesbank president is human after all? Officially in Oslo
yesterday to hold forth again on the subject of German monetary policy,

Ruud, the two-time double Olympic ski-jumping gold medallist.
A celebrity in Germany in the 1930s, Ruud had once recounted his tales to a
Bavarian audience that included the bright-eyed 12-year-old Helmut. Nearly
60 years later, Europe's monetary Cerberus requested another meeting. So
Ruud gave him the grand tour of his ski museum and presented him with a

There is nothing like a royal wedding to buck up the masses. Japan's Crown
Prince Naruhito has done his bit to reform the tradition-bound Imperial
Family by choosing a thoroughly modern, multilingual, 29-year-old diplomat
as his bride, and presumably the country's next empress.
The 32-year-old prince is to marry Masako Owada, a graduate of Harvard and
Oxford, and the daughter of vice foreign minister Hisashi Owada. As well as
much rejoicing by Japanese television hosts and newspapers, the announcement
was greeted with enthusiasm by business leaders such as Gaishi Hiraiwa,
chairman of the Keidanren.
Many Japanese had feared that the crown prince would be condemned to
bachelorhood, as potential brides balked either at the massive media
coverage that his attentions generated or at the thought of a life of
refined confinement behind the palace walls.
The present empress, Michiko, also a commoner, is known to have had a tough
time adjusting to the conservative ways of the Imperial Household Agency.
But the crown prince's choice of a tennis-playing environmentalist was
generally interpreted by ponderous Imperial Household-watchers last night as
a sign that he intends to make the family less cloistered and more
international, a not so easy task for the heir to a chrysanthemum throne
still ascribed supernatural powers by Shinto theology.

FT  07 JAN 93 / All things in moderation: Economic pressures are prompting
Iran to mend fences with the industrialised world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alongside the toll booths at the end of the three-lane highway from Tehran
to Qom, Iran's main centre for theological instruction, stands a huge
hoarding proclaiming in English, 'Israel must be destroyed'. The meaning
appears clear, but like so much else in Iran today it is now said to be
capable of a different interpretation.
According to Mr Javad Larijani, educated in Iraq and California, a member of
parliament and special adviser on foreign relations to President Ali Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the one thing it does not mean is that Israel should be
literally removed from the map. All it means, he says, is that the 'racist
and religious ideas' that lie behind the state of Israel, just like those of
apartheid which characterised the regime in South Africa, should be
destroyed.
Mr Larijani is regarded in Tehran as a prime example of the new breed of
younger politicians promoted by Mr Rafsanjani to foster a more pragmatic
Iranian view of the world. After more than a decade of revolution, war and
being painted as the maverick of international politics, Iran is in the
midst of a complex political adjustment. While remaining true to its Islamic
principles, it is trying to win the confidence of the industrialised world
to gain access to the technology and capital required for the reconstruction
and modernisation of the economy.
Much of the most visible fire has gone from the revolution that overthrew
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979. One foreign diplomat described the
country as in a state of national amnesia. Few people wish to recall the
bitter struggle for power between the clergy and their former allies, the
extreme left-wing Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, and the shocking toll of the
eight-year war with Iraq which, when it ended in 1988, had cost more than 1m
lives. Measured in terms of active domestic political opponents, the regime
has never appeared so secure.
Violent political challenges are still possible, but the durability of
Iran's clerics is rapidly being tested in more sophisticated and demanding
ways. Mr Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei, the country's
spiritual leader and successor to Ayatollah Khomeini, have yet to prove that
the world's only Islamic republican government can match the material
aspirations of about 60m people, that it can administer the machinery of
state, and ultimately that it can surmount the divisions within the
administration which threaten the modernisation process.
How the regime responds to these challenges will have an importance
stretching well beyond Iran. Its successes and failures will provide
ammunition for other struggles being mounted by fundamentalist groups trying
to overthrow existing governments. Regimes in the Middle East, such as
Algeria and to a lesser extent Egypt, accuse Iran of aiding Islamic
dissidents. In the newly created central Asian republics, Iranian envoys
have been building political and economic ties. In Sudan and in the West
Bank and Gaza, the Arab territories occupied by Israel, the role of Iran is
said to be becoming more influential.
America's Central Intelligence Agency and Mr Robert Gates, its director,
sharpened international fears last month by highlighting Iran's nuclear
ambitions, suggesting that it might have a nuclear bomb by the end of the
century. Some officials in Tehran believe that Iran and Islam are being set
up as the replacements for the Soviet Union and communism in the lexicon of
American demonology.
So diverse are the official voices heard in Tehran that there is evidence to
support almost any theory. Listening to Ayatollah Khamenei on the role of
the US and Britain it sounds as if Iran and other large parts of the
developing world are the continuing victims of the most pernicious
conspiracy. The Tehran Times, the English language daily sometimes seen as a
mouthpiece for moderation, recently provoked the withdrawal of Egypt's
senior diplomat in Iran by suggesting that President Hosni Mubarak should be
violently removed from office.
Mr Larijani, on the other hand, talks about international compromise,
understanding and mutual respect. He proposes a conference of British and
Iranian intellectuals to discuss the problems of Mr Salman Rushdie,
sentenced to death for purportedly insulting Islam in his book Satanic
Verses.
An hour with Mr Akhbar Tourkan, who must be a leading candidate for the
title of the Middle East's most conciliatory minister of defence, creates
the impression that Iran, so recently at war, has rarely felt less
threatened. 'We have no enemies,' says the minister. As a result, Mr Tourkan
says he can manage with one of the smallest military procurement budgets in
the Gulf of about Dollars 1bn a year.
One conclusion to be drawn from all this is that Iran, having defined itself
primarily in terms of what it is against, is having greater problems in
deciding what it is for. After the parliamentary elections last spring, many
international observers were confident that a new political trend had
emerged. Mr Rafsanjani had successfully eased out his most vocal, hardline
critics and had replaced them with MPs of relatively liberal orientation.
Iran's re-entry into international life would now accelerate in tandem with
its economic development.
This assessment has been proved at least temporarily wrong, not because Mr
Rafsanjani's objectives were incorrectly interpreted but because of the
changing pressures on the regime. A particular revelation last year was the
extent to which the government felt obliged to meet consumer demand, a
commitment reinforced by riots in Mashhad and other cities during the
summer. The immediate cause of the disturbances is said to have been harsh
official action against squatters, but there is no denying the pain that
inflation and unemployment, both running at about 20 per cent, are causing.
Sitting behind his desk in Qom, Grand Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi, a leading
Shia jurist, refuses to accept even the concept of a division between people
and the clergy. 'The government is Moslem and the people are Moslem. There
is no possibility that the people might revolt. They would understand the
problems and appreciate that the government is seeking to resolve them.' Mr
Rafsanjani and the members of the Majlis (parliament) appear less sure and
are taking serious risks with longer-term health of the economy to forestall
any further confrontations on the streets.
Even before the disturbances there was evidence that the authorities, and in
particular the central bank, had partially lost control of the economy.
Encouraged by the brief surge in oil prices which followed the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iran cast spending caution to the winds.
The trade deficit in the financial year to the end of March 1992 is
estimated at about Dollars 10bn, exacerbated by the central bank's decision
to allow the commercial banks to open letters of credit without supervision.
With oil revenues this year unlikely to top Dollars 17bn it is not
surprising that longer delays in payments are being experienced by foreign
suppliers. Officially the delays are described as technical hitches and it
is said that the payments backlog on letters of credit should be resolved
within three months. Central bank officials have been reassuring foreign
bankers that Iran has more than enough reserves to cover the payments
deficit, but needs the liquidity to support the rial when the official
exchange rate is floated later this year. Both assertions are open to doubt.
Some bankers fear that Iran has already done serious damage to its
international creditworthiness. More than Dollars 2.5bn is overdue on
letters of credit, some of it by up to four months, and unofficial estimates
suggest that there is another Dollars 7bn-Dollars 10bn in the pipeline with
particularly severe bunching at the end of the current Iranian financial
year. Several national export credit guarantee organisations are urgently
reviewing their policies towards Iran and there are possibilities that cover
could in some cases be withdrawn.
One avenue of escape for Iran would be to convert some of its short-term
commitments into medium and long-term debt, but this would have to be backed
by sovereign guarantees. The central bank and the Ministry of Finance are
balking at such a step, in large part because the issue would have to be
brought before the parliament which is politically sensitive to foreign
indebtedness. It is also probable that the parliament does not know how
substantial the debt arrears are.
Some Iranians argue that Mr Rafsanjani could force acceptance of sovereign
guarantees through the Majlis, but watching him deliver his two-and-a-half
hour budget speech last month was to appreciate how little he intimidates
the assembly. At most times the chamber was only two-thirds full, MPs
chatted among themselves as the speech was delivered, and a couple of times
the president was mildly barracked for taking so long.
The Ministry of Finance argues that the external payments situation will
ease soon because 50 per cent fewer letters of credit have been issued in
the current financial year. However all the visual evidence is that Tehran
and other cities are still caught up in a consumer boom of considerable
proportions. Shops are bulging with everything from perfumes to western
fashions, most of which can never be worn in public, and from BMWs to video
players, which are illegal but sold in their hundreds of thousands. Although
most of the population is too poor to do more than gaze at the shop windows,
the displays symbolise an end to the misery of the 1980s.
With Mr Rafsanjani due to face a presidential election in June it is not a
symbol that he wants to tarnish, whatever the consequences for Iran's
international credit rating and the negotiations to secure loans needed to
launch large-scale infrastructure projects.
He also is unlikely, or unwilling, to check the relentless quest for
additional sources of income from officials whose salaries alone are too
modest for them to participate in the consumer boom. Although this has
always been part of the Iranian way of doing business, those who have long
associations with the country say that it has now reached epidemic
proportions. One local businessman commented: 'In one sense it is worse than
before the revolution because so many more people are involved. Everyone is
trying to extract money from the system and too few people care whether what
they are doing is of any value to the country.'
Optimists who were chastened by the speed with which the political pendulum
swung against the liberal trend following the parliamentary elections, are
also watching anxiously the reappearance of the baseej, the irregular shock
troops of the revolution. Under the ultimate command of the Ayatollah
Khamenei, they are making their presence felt at checkpoints at night in
Tehran and their activities could be linked to the the re-emergence of what
some Iranians identify as hardline shadow organisations within government
ministries.
The complexity and obscurity of this continued jostling for influence in
Iran will continue to pose hard problems of interpretation for western
leaders and businessmen. With sustainable oil production targeted to reach
4.5m barrels a day later this year Iran's export earnings make it an
attractive market, but only among the most courageous can it yet be seen as
an investment opportunity. Its recently exposed lack of financial management
and its willingness to put consumer demand ahead of urgently needed
reconstruction projects underlines the need for caution.
It may also serve to put into perspective the more alarmist American
predictions about Iran's international ambitions. The revolution lives in
the rhetoric of the country's leaders, but there are no queues of young men
volunteering to fight in Bosnia. And as one senior official pointed out,
huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons did not save the Soviet economy from
disaster. In Tehran there seems a growing appreciation that the longevity of
the regime will be decided within Iran's borders, not by its success in
exporting revolution.
The new Clinton administration and western European governments will make
their own contribution to the evolution of Iranian politics. President
Rafsanjani suffered domestically from the west trumpeting its belief in his
moderation so loudly. Similarly, renewed efforts to cast Iran as a radical
threat to western interests and Gulf stability will assuredly strengthen the
most revolutionary elements in Tehran. Probably there is little the west can
do that is guaranteed to assist Iran's pragmatists. But there is much it can
do to sustain their enemies.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Oil spill in the Shetlands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WRECK of the Braer on the Shetlands is likely to become the worst
pollution disaster the UK has ever experienced. It has already produced
calls for tougher controls on ships in British waters.
But it would be wrong for the UK to act precipitately, or even to adopt
unilateral measures in an area which requires a high degree of international
co-operation. Although wrecked oil tankers have often been in the headlines
recently, the underlying trend in oil spills is downwards, and there is
already a body of international law covering shipping standards and
pollution liability.
Nonetheless, the increasing stresses on the oil industry caused by weak oil
prices and low profitability are rightly giving concern that shippers are
cutting corners in order to strengthen their margins. What we need to know
is whether this disaster was caused by culpable negligence, or whether it
was an unfortunate combination of bad luck and bad weather.
In either case, some form of regulatory response will be called for. An
obvious model for the UK to follow would be the US, which passed tough new
legislation in the form of the 1990 Oil Pollution Act in the wake of the
Exxon Valdez disaster. This set the toughest standards yet in existence: it
required ships to have double hulls for added strength, and imposed
unlimited liability on them for the costs of cleaning up any pollution they
caused.
At best controversial
But although this hastily enacted law has forced shipowners to take a close
look at their operations, it is at best controversial, and at worst
unworkable, judging by the widely held view in the legal profession that it
will have to be returned to Congress for redrafting. In particular, the
unlimited liability requirement has frightened off ship insurers, and
encouraged large companies to put 'corporate veils' between themselves and
their ships to insulate themselves from the liability.
In acting unilaterally, the US has also complicated efforts to create common
international regulations under the auspices of the International Maritime
Organisation. Given that the Braer was a US-owned, Liberian-registered
vessel with a Greek master and an Asian crew, travelling from Norway to
Canada, the need for well-defined standards is obvious. It happens that
Liberia has a good record both on ship safety and on incident inquiry, and
there is no immediate reason to suspect that the Braer was sub-standard. IMO
regulations will require all new ships built from next July to have double
hulls, and all existing ships to be upgraded by 1995. There are also moves
within the IMO to oblige shipowners to put safety on a par with profits in
the management of their operations.
Stricter policing
The problem with the IMO, however, is that enforcement of its regulations is
up to the signatory states - there is no international police force. If the
Braer disaster leads to stricter policing, that would be welcome. A second
weakness of the current approach is the emphasis on the responsibilities of
the shipowner rather than the owner of the cargo.
Under present IMO arrangements, a compensation fund financed by
oil-importing countries (excluding the US) will pay up to Pounds 54m for
environmental liabilities over and above the vessel's own insurance. This is
shortly to be increased to Pounds 120m. The IMO believes, probably rightly,
that this arrangement is preferable to unlimited liability since it provides
a much stronger guarantee of a pay-out within a reasonable period of time.
Any significant change in the existing arrangements would have to strike a
careful balance between the requirements of safety and the environment, and
the commercial need to ship oil. Braer may, after all, have shown no more
than that ships can break down, and that bad weather can then hamper a
clean-up.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Choosing a new governor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBACLE over the ERM has not led to a serious review of the role and
structure of the Bank of England. It has led, instead, to gestures in the
direction of greater openness that mask what amounts to a prompt return to
business as usual. What matters, it appears, is not what the Bank of England
is to do and how it should do it better, but who is to be responsible for
doing whatever it is to do. It is all too typically British.
In the view of both Whitehall and Westminster, the governorship is more a
dignified than an efficient part of the constitution. The Bank may be more
palatial. Its staff may even be better paid. But it is the Treasury that is
supposed to have the brains and certainly has the power. It is hardly
surprising therefore that the choice of a replacement for Mr Robin Leigh
Pemberton is being discussed more as if it were just another horse race than
as a matter of real policy importance.
It need not be this way and certainly should not be this way. Lord Justice
Bingham's scathing report on the supervision of BCCI raises pressing
questions about the Bank of England's management and its role as a banking
supervisor. The ERM saga raises still more questions about the Bank's role
in the formulation of monetary policy. The appointment of the new governor
should, above all, send a signal about how such questions are to be
answered.
The starting point must be the Bank's mission. 'Its core purposes are,' it
says, 'to maintain the value of the currency and the integrity of the
financial system and to promote the efficiency of financial markets.' This
may look logical enough, but the present Bank of England is, in fact, more
an historical accident than a logical construct.
Obvious task
Maintaining the value of the currency is, indeed, an obvious task for a
central bank. Yet the Bank of England has never held sole responsibility for
that function. It has either operated within a fixed exchange rate regime or
under Treasury tutelage.
This needs to change, not for merely theoretical reasons, nor because
central bank independence is at the heart of the Maastricht treaty to which
the government says it is committed, but because past monetary policy has
been so awful. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system,
the pound has lost 85 per cent of its internal value and the economy has
passed through three agonising go-stop cycles, for each of which monetary
policy mistakes were principally responsible. Calls for a more independent
central bank are a fully justified response to such failures.
While the Bank may not have responsibility for monetary policy, it has
collected several others, instead: as lender of last resort, as banking
supervisor and as the voice of the City. Yet there are potential conflicts
among these roles. Was one of the reasons for tolerating BCCI not the
assumption that the more institutions there are in London the better? Do
naive depositors not view supervision by the Bank of England as implying a
parallel commitment in its capacity of lender of last resort?
Managerial failures
If the Bank's functions need to be rethought from outside, it also needs to
be restructured from inside. If it is to have greater responsibility for
monetary policy, for example, it will need a new Court of Directors, one
with far greater policy-making expertise.
The new governor himself must be capable of representing and defending the
Bank's policy views both in the UK and abroad; he should be able to
contribute to a national debate on the proper functions and structure of the
Bank; he should be open to new ideas; and he should be able to tackle the
managerial failures of the Bank that have been revealed so starkly in the
case of BCCI. If such a paragon is not available in the UK, the government
should look abroad.
Yet too much must not be made of the appointment itself. Far more important
is the government's own attitude to the formation of monetary policy. It has
shown itself resolutely determined to persist with a structure in which
there are at most two votes that matter, those of the chancellor of the
exchequer and the prime minister. What the UK needs, instead, is a central
bank that is responsible for monetary stability and a governor who is
accountable for failure to achieve it. It would need that if sterling were
to rejoin the ERM. It would need it still more if it were not to do so. The
question, this time, must not be who sits in the Bank of England. It should,
instead, be what he will be responsible for doing.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Kenyan elections a significant move towards genuine,
multi-party politics (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M NGALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial of December 31, you appear to stand alone in your
conclusion that democracy lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll for 26
years. On December 29, Kenyans patiently and peacefully cast their votes to
choose their leader and party. All the observers have, with minor
reservations, accepted that this process is a significant step in Kenya's
transition to genuine multi-party democracy. You may not agree with the
choice or the margins by which the winner won, but that is what democracy is
all about.
President Daniel arap Moi and the Kenya African National Union won. The
democratic thing for the opposition to do is to take their seats in
parliament and make their contributions from there.
As you must have observed, defections and counter-defections affected all
the political parties, but it seems to me that when candidates defect from
Kanu it is acceptable to you, while the reverse is not.
In this particular election, civil servants have not been involved. However,
a few individuals, though they are civil servants, made compromising
political statements. In these cases, and in accordance with the code of
regulations governing the civil service, appropriate action was taken.

multi-party politics (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL POWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader of December 31 ('Flawed elections') cannot go unchallenged.
You say 'democracy has lost in Kenya's first multi-party poll in 26 years'.
You are too quick to judge.
Virtually no one claims that the Kenyan general election was perfect and
most observers concede that, at the margins, some disadvantage was probably
experienced by the main opposition parties. As a move towards multi-party
politics, however, the election was a remarkable achievement. Kenya can now
hope for an era of much more 'transparency, accountability and good
governance' in its politics.
With regards to the election results, the following facts need to be
recognised:
Mr Daniel arap Moi won the presidency by a wide margin of more than 530,000
votes; this was 40 per cent more votes than his closest rival and equivalent
to more than 10 per cent of the votes cast. His share of the national vote
was 37 per cent, not far short of the level achieved in 1992 by Mr Major in
Britain or Mr Clinton in the US, except that Moi faced three serious
opponents, of whom the weakest, Odinga, still managed to get 17.3 per cent
of the vote.
Moi was the only presidential candidate to achieve the required 25 per cent
in five of the eight provinces. Consequently, Moi's claim that he is the
only truly national leader as opposed to a tribal leader is not just secure;
it is enhanced.
In parliamentary terms, the simplest way of understanding the Kanu victory
is to note that, of the seven largest ethnic groups in Kenya, Kanu had a
convincing victory in four - the Kisii, Kalenjin, Mijikenda and Kamba - and
a narrow victory in a fifth, the Luhya. This achievement gave Kanu 60 seats
in parliament, and outweighed the combined seats of the Kikuyu and Luo
communities, which totalled 55. Kanu also did well among many of the smaller
ethnic groups. Indeed the only groups Kanu lost outright were the Luos,
Kikuyus and the latter's traditional allies, the Embus.
These are the hard psephological facts.
The frustrations of the Kikuyu and Luo communities in Kenya are largely
those related to two previously privileged ethnic groups who have discovered
that they are not the only 'kids on the block'.
The Kenyan election tells us that the vast majority of Kenya's ethnic groups
have the good sense to want to avoid getting caught in the crossfire between
the selfish ethnic ambitions of the Aideeds and Milosevics of this world.
The west should now restore Kenya to its good books and allow it to resume
its claim as the country in Africa which 'works' and which is determined to
lead by example the Dark Continent towards a brighter future.

<TEXT>
A LIFE
By Jonathan Aitken
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson,
Pounds 25, 633 pages
About eight years ago the 'Dear Bill' column in Private Eye, the UK
satirical magazine, referred to the Royal Commission set up to investigate
the Falklands war. The fictional Denis Thatcher wrote that it came as no
surprise to him when it concluded on page 864 'the Argies did it'.
If you believe Jonathan Aitken's encomium to Richard Nixon, the blame for
Watergate should be laid at the door of John Dean; or the press blew it out
of all proportion; or any tangential involvement of the 37th president of
the US was explicable by his understandable and compassionate desire to
protect John Mitchell, who was drinking too much.
Indeed, if you can struggle through Jonathan Aitken and if you are a member
of the insufferably superior British political classes, who - with the
exception of a handful of men like Denis Healey - never bother to understand
American politics, you will undoubtedly agree with the author's lofty
conclusion: 'that Richard Nixon, both as a man and a statesman, has been
excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his
virtues'.
The rehabilitation of Mr Nixon has become a fair-sized industry, pursued
with undiminished zeal by the former president himself. This is now extended
to a book by a Tory MP and former journalist. Mr Aitken concedes his oeuvre
was written with the full co-operation of Mr Nixon and his presidential
library. They met in 1966, renewed the acquaintance in 1975, and by 1978 Mr
Aitken was organising the first post-resignation trip to a western country.
Mr Aitken is honest enough to declare his biases whenever he feels
necessary. This should not be necessary. Nixon's achievements - not only in
foreign policy - are not in dispute by serious contemporary historians, like
Stephen Ambrose and Garry Wills. But what both do - and Mr Aitken does not,
beyond noting his awkwardness in discussing certain subjects - is to
acknowledge the dimension of his faults, which are profound.
Watergate may have been the apotheosis of these, but it was not the only
one. Only a blind Nixon adherent could seriously blame Pat Brown (Jerry's
father) for the bitterness of Nixon's notorious concession speech in 1962
after his defeat in the California governor's race. Only someone who shares
Nixon's perception of a world permanently arrayed against him could write
that the hapless George McGovern ran the more unprincipled campaign in 1972.
Only somebody under Nixon's spell could seriously believe that the high
crimes and misdemeanours for which Nixon would have been impeached had he
not resigned were no greater than JFK's links with the Mafia and LBJ's
financial corruption.
No passage more irritates this reviewer than the sub-chapter grandly
entitled 'Watergate Thoughts from Abroad'. Here are vacuities such as 'from
an international perspective, Watergate looked a tragedy of errors not a
catalogue of crimes'. Whose international perspective?
Finally, it should be noted that the rehabilitation does not even now go
unchallenged. An article in last month's New Yorker by Seymour Hersh quotes
from the as-yet unheard Nixon tapes, which have not been released for
general consumption because of the delaying tactics of Mr Nixon's lawyers.
Mr Hersh claims that, in 1972, immediately after George Wallace was shot,
Nixon discussed with Charles Colson sending Howard Hunt to Milwaukee to
plant McGovernite campaign literature in the apartment of Arthur Bremer, the
would-be assassin. Hunt only failed because the FBI had moved with dispatch
and sealed Bremer's apartment.
Was that the real Nixon, or could it be the pasteurised and authorised
version that Mr Aitken would have us believe? The debate will rage forever.
In the meanwhile, read Stephen Ambrose or Garry Wills for something closer
to the truth.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: A 'hole' should be kept for exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important problem facing the British economy is no longer whether
or when growth will resume. It is rather, how far and how fast will recovery
be able to go before it runs into some constraint?
The constraint that is seen by most analysts is that old bogeyman: the
balance of payments. Some readers will recall my scepticism about using this
aggregate as a guide to policy. The case for a more relaxed attitude to the
balance of payments depended on two assumptions. One was that the
government's own budget was in order. The other that there was in place an
anchor against inflation such as membership of the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) or at least public confidence in a firm exchange rate policy.
Neither of these conditions now exists. The payments deficit must therefore
be taken into account as a warning signal. The budget and the payments
deficits are not twins as some American economists used to think; but the
two together matter more than either would on its own.
What worries the mainstream pessimists is not the size of the UK payments
deficit itself but that it should be incurred in a recession which has been
much worse for the UK than for its trading partners. Usually, depressed home
demand discourages imports and intensifies the quest for exports.
Some quantification is provided by David Walton in the last Goldman Sachs UK
Economics Analyst of 1992. He has revised downwards his earlier estimate of
the gap between actual and potential output in the UK, which he now believes
is only about 3 per cent. For since mid-1991, although unemployment has
increased, the gap has stopped widening as companies have scrapped capacity.
Walton puts the British economy's potential growth rate at 2 per cent per
annum, slightly below the trend in the last cycle. If the slack is to be
absorbed and unemployment brought down as far as capacity permits, the UK
will need to grow at an average of 1 percentage point above trend, ie 3 per
cent per annum, over the three years starting in mid-1993.
On the Goldman Sachs diagnosis even this unambitious 3 per cent growth rate
is unlikely to be achieved, as it would soon lead to a continuing current
account deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product, equal to the peak
reached in 1989, a year of acknowledged excess demand.
Let us assume that such a large and continuing deficit could not be easily
financed and that the payments gap has to be held not too far above its
present levels. Assume too that output in the industrial countries that make
up the OECD were to grow by an average of 3 1/2 per cent per annum, which is
quite optimistic as it involves a fair degree of catch-up. On these
assumptions the UK could, it is said, grow by less than half the
international rate.
For Britain to be able to achieve 3 per cent growth a further '10 per cent
boost to competitiveness' is said by Walton to be required over and above
that achieved after departure from the ERM. There is a close similarity
between this figure and the 15 per cent further devaluation Wynne Godley has
declared to be necessary - a little erosion of devaluation by inflation
would bring the two together.
It is worth noting too that more optimistic assumptions about the amount of
unused capacity available to be taken up or, about the underlying growth
rate of the economy, might make the problem worse. For it would point to a
higher desirable growth rate and thus a higher potential payments deficit.
Throwing in the towel and accepting slow growth would not help either. Not
only would unemployment climb inexorably, but the budget deficit would
become unsustainable, with diminished tax revenues and increased calls on
social spending.
I am agnostic about the above analysis which I have cited mainly for its
clarity. Mainstream pessimists may have underestimated the responsiveness of
British exports to world market growth or overestimated the relation between
imports and GDP.
Econometricians may also underestimate the effects of improved price and
profit margin competitiveness on export and import volume. This last
sterling devaluation has occurred when inflation has been lower and
recessionary forces in the labour market more severe than on any past
occasion. It therefore has a better chance of sticking, and for a longer
period, than before.
It makes a great deal of difference whether one takes the flattening out of
import volumes towards the end of 1992 and the jump in exports seriously or
not. Quite small changes over quite short periods can radically alter
impressions of underlying trends. At this stage I only want to raise doubts
about the fashionable pessimism.
There are more controversial areas. The imperfections of the balance of
payments data - which will of course be worse this year, while the European
Community adjusts to a new recording system and we are deprived of monthly
trade figures - are no mere detail. Despite all the efforts of UK official
statisticians, there was still a 'balancing item' of unrecorded inflows of
more than Pounds 10bn, as large as the recorded deficit itself, during the
first three quarters of 1992. Moreover there is still a world 'black hole'
of more than Dollars 100bn per annum - the amount by which aggregate world
deficits exceed aggregate surpluses.
There are also analytical problems. We have no real idea how far the UK
current deficit is the mirror image of an inflow of long-term investment
which will produce future foreign exchange earnings. It is at least
suggestive that the surge in imports over the past few years has coincided
with a large inflow of Japanese investment and a trend towards
re-establishing the UK as a net exporter of cars.
To try to push sterling down further on the basis of fears of a future
balance of payments constraint and hopes of the benefits of yet more
devaluation would be foolhardy in the extreme. It is touch and go whether
the post-ERM devaluation will allow the chancellor of the exchequer's 1-4
per cent inflation guidelines to be met throughout the next financial year.
A further devaluation would put the objective quite out of reach and
entrench the UK in the third tier of EC countries, which not merely stay out
of the Franco-German hard core, but could not even hope to meet the
Maastricht criteria for convergence in the middle of the decade.
Yet it would be equally foolhardy to dismiss out of hand the payments
worries of Godley, Walton and others, and risk letting the economy run into
the buffers yet again in a few years. What is required is a medium-term
financial strategy which keeps home demand on a tight, but not recessionary,
rein. In terms made familiar in the post-1967 devaluation debates, a 'hole'
should be kept in the economy, which could be filled, if necessary, by
exports and imports saving.
The strategy needs, however, spelling out for a world in which the
government does not control resources directly, but merely influences money
flows. I have frequently urged a medium-term objective for the growth of
demand in nominal terms - that is in actual cash - at a rate sufficient to
sustain a reasonable rate of growth, but not to finance inflation.
The usual way of expressing this objective is in terms of nominal GDP, which
is simply the GDP figures as they occur without the customary conversion
into real terms. This, however, is only an approximation to the aggregate
the government and Bank of England can and should influence, which should be
a variant known as 'total domestic expenditure'. The latter includes all the
components of GNP with the exception of net exports. If it is kept to a
stable and modest path, there will be room in the economy for an improvement
in exports relative to imports.
Let us accept a 3 per cent per annum average annual growth objective for the
next few years and take 3 per cent as a reasonable inflation objective. If
there were no payments worries, this would point to an average of 6 per cent
per annum as an objective for domestic spending for the next few years.
But in view of payments worries this objective should be reduced to 5 per
cent. The difference is much more important than it looks. For if inflation
continues to average 3 per cent, unused capacity will not be taken up by
domestic spending, and will be available to meet overseas demand as that
recovers. If the gap is not so filled, the government will be able to take
another look at a later date.
The immediate implication is that the government should take the benefit of
the present upsurge in sterling, so long as it lasts, mainly in rebuilding
the reserves and further reductions in interest rates, even if the latter
have to be reversed before long.
If the interest rate cuts required to prevent a sterling overshoot prove too
much of a stimulus, so much the better. For it would give the chancellor the
perfect pretext to make an early start on the spending cuts and tax
increases which will in any case, eventually be required to put the Budget
into better shape. But I thought it better to go through the underlying
economy-wide arithmetic rather than simply just moan on about the Budget
deficit.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested in the article in your centenary issue ('Police hot on
the heels of Jabez Balfour', January 4) as Balfour was my wicked great,
great uncle. You refer to his talkativeness. His mother commented when he
was 10 that she had 'never heard anything like him'.
I am working on a biography of his mother, Mrs Clara Lucas Balfour, who
overcame illegitimacy and childhood poverty to become a travelling lecturer,
speaking on temperance, literature, history and the position of women. Her
contribution to adult education is now almost unknown. The scandal
surrounding her youngest son may be one reason.
Jabez was only five years old when she commented in a letter: 'There is very
much to fear as well as hope in his case. He will be either good or evil.'
If anyone has information on the Balfours, I should be interested to know of
it.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Independence would put principle at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AVINASH PERSAUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Norman's call for an open debate on the independence of the Bank
of England (Economics Notebook, January 4) is all the more pressing given
that the UK government remains without a credible, medium-term framework for
economic policy three months after sterling's departure from the exchange
rate mechanism.
What has passed for debate so far has been little more than the populist
assertion that politicians cannot be trusted to stand above their narrow
political interests. This insidious precept implies the electorate cannot be
trusted to make choices in its own interests. If the electorate is so
incompetent at making choices, why stop at an independent monetary policy;
why not an independent fiscal policy too?
Certain characteristics of monetary policy lead many to suggest that it
deserves special treatment. However, independence must be seen to pass
stringent tests of economic performance before being adopted.
The international evidence remains ambiguous as to the impact of independent
monetary policy on easing the burden of disinflation. The country with the
best inflation performance among the industrial economies in the past 15
years has one of the least independent central banks - Japan. One of the
most dramatic disinflations in the industrial world in the 1980s occurred in
a country notorious for politically motivated monetary policy - the UK. In
1992, the independent Riksbank in Sweden was unable to maintain its Ecu link
in the grip of intense currency speculation, while this year the G3 country
generally forecast to score highest on the 'misery index' (unemployment plus
inflation) has the most independent of central banks  - Germany.
Monetary policy independence is no panacea. The evidence suggests that, on
its own, central bank independence is neither a sufficient nor a necessary
ingredient of economic success. Independence, then, appears to offer little
compensation for the abandonment of an important principle of democratic
accountability in public policy.

Sir, Isn't moving the FT leader from a position on the left to the right of
the inside-back pages something of an overreaction to the criticism of your
(marginally pro-Labour) editorial last year?

Some say that cutting meat from one's diet induces a more pacific
temperament. I have a parallel theory for the cinema. What if Hollywood cut
all the Italian-American directors from its payroll? We would begin with
older bloodletters like De Palma and Scorsese. Then we would round up
newcomers like Quentin Tarantino, whose Reservoir Dogs has caused much
swooning and screaming in US cinemas. It is the tender tale of six hoodlums
running amok with guns and razors after a bungled bank robbery.
I jest, of course, about the ethnic expulsion: I like cathartic violence as
much as the next Aristotelian. Besides, Reservoir Dogs is overpowering not
for what it shows - here a lake of blood around dying Tim Roth, there a
severed ear brandished like a Christmas cracker novelty - but for the nervy
fear it sets pumping in us from its start.
We keep shuttling between the horrific and the ridiculous. The camera
circling six black-suited thugs as they chatter over trivia in a diner; then
the gang's post-heist explosion into a warehouse, plus hostage policeman;
then the flashback glimpses, jagged as broken glass, of the robbery; then
the Jacobean momentum with torments, quarrels and deaths mounting up,
cabined inside a single setting and scored to a dialogue track as
haywire-demotic as early Scorsese. 'Who'd you kill?'; 'A few cops'; 'Any
real people?'; 'Just cops.'
This is the end of the world seen as both bang and whimper. There is comic
nihilism even in the characters' Toytown job-names, bestowed on them by
their Mr Big (Lawrence Tierney) and used by Tarantino to chapter-head
sequences: 'Mr White' (bullet-faced Harvey Keitel), 'Mr Pink' (verminous
Steve Buscemi), 'Mr Blonde' (razor-wielding Elvis lookalike Michael Madsen),
'Mr Orange' (Britain's Tim Roth, superb as the dying crook).
The characters' interchangeability is the film's big, black joke. Out goes
the romantic Manicheism of traditional heist cinema: the loveably kooky
crooks versus the cut-outs from the cop shop. Here by the close every crook
is firing guns at every other crook - catalysed by the horrific scene in
which Mr Orange sets about the pinioned cop and his ear - and the exact
casus belli is lost in the chaos of identikit suits and dotty names. Cursed
by many for its vicious amorality, Reservoir Dogs seems to me, in its
apocalyptic contempt for the criminal mind-set, the most moral crime film in
memory.
Watching Brian De Palma's Raising Cain - another day, another
Italian-American bloodfest - is also a moral experience. Like Tarantino, De
Palma neither canonises the criminal mind nor portentously condemns it.
Better to shake the thing around in an absurdist Moulinex and see how
quickly and interestingly it comes apart.
For QT's reductionist verismo, though, substitute B De P's accretive rococo.
Disturbed psychologist John Lithgow has an imaginary evil twin (Lithgow with
a sneer) and a not-so-imaginary evil father (Lithgow with Kane-like white
hair). Dad once used Lithgow Jr as a guinea pig for experiments in childhood
trauma. Now Mrs Lithgow Jr (Lolita Davidovich) is worried her spouse is
doing the same. 'I go to work,' she exclaims, 'and the child psychologist
stays home playing house Dad]' She is concerned, you see, about their little
child.
Then there is more. An old flame of Mrs L's (Steven Bauer) turns up to
scorch the status quo; a murder is committed; a pair of odd detectives call
in an odder super-shrink (Frances Sternhagen); and finally a shopping bag of
oranges, a baby, a sun-dial and a black-wigged woman with a gun come
together to form the climax.
This wonderfully crazed thriller bears the same stylistic relation to early
De Palmas like Obsession and Carrie as The Tempest does to Hamlet. Be gone,
dull realism. Here the swags and flourishes of De Palma's last great
brainstorm Dressed To Kill are re-touched to create an other-worldly fable
about our world.
In De Palma films there is no such thing as terra firma. Every setting,
however humble from city park to motel bedroom, is queasily stylised by
colour or camerawork; and even life's simple certainties rebound or betray.
Nor, in the giddy drama of existence, do human beings quite know what roles
they are meant to be playing. Miss Davidovich might be lead victim or lady
detective. Mr Lithgow might be son, father or twin; doctor or demon. And
Miss Sternhagen - well, note the scene in which she walks one way down a
police corridor and is then pulled back another and tell me why you laugh
out loud.
Of course the film was rubbished in America. They have still not pardoned Mr
De P for The Bonfire Of The Vanities. And in any case cinema in the US is
fast becoming a branch of daytime soap opera. If it does not stand there
delivering platitudes in head-and-shoulders shots, it must be kinky or
corrupt. But Raising Cain's title dares to invoke a sound-syllable from
another great rococo title in the cinema, and how Orson Welles would have
loved this strange, beautiful descendant.
*****
Elsewhere, all is France. Bertrand Tavernier, Eric Rohmer and Alain Corneau
all steal into London bearing celluloid. Two and a half hours of it in
Tavernier's L627, a neo-realist cop drama whose exact purpose eludes me.
Surely it cannot be a rechauffage of the old chestnut about the police being
as bad as the criminals?
Perhaps it can, as the plain-clothes Paris drug squad led by plain-looks
Lulu (Didier Bezace, magnetic despite wearing what looks like joke-shop
nose, moustache and glasses) hurtle about town making busts. The film's
pattern is as follows. Out to the streets or subways to capture dealers;
then back to the portacabin-style HQ to have tea or do over the captives;
then out to the streets; then back to HQ . . .
Is this is a vivid picture of a monotonous, soul-destroying life - or a
monotonous, soul-destroying picture? Tavernier's humanism never takes short
cuts: hence its magnificence when it is in full motor order (Round Midnight,
Life And Nothing But). But L627 - the title invokes a French article of law
about the treatment of drug offenders - is by my watch two decades behind
what popular American cinema has been doing and saying, more interestingly,
about dodgy cops since The French Connection.
On to Alain Corneau's Tous Les Matins Du Monde, and not a cop in sight.
Gerard Depardieu's face in full close-up sighs out memories of his great
music master as a tear falls. We are in the late 17th century when baroque
music reigned and when, in extended Depardieu-recalled flashback, one
maestro called Sainte Colombe (Jean-Pierre Marielle) handed down viol de
gamba wisdom to one Marin Marais (Depardieu in youth played by his son
Guillaume).
Yet Monsieur SC, a stern and jealous widower with a love-starved daughter
(Anne Brochet), first welcomes MM into his country villa as one would
welcome a hatchet murderer. Moods are as high-strung as the music. Faces
glower through the half-light washing in from windows - cameraman Yves
Angelo's no-tricks period lighting is a joy - while tautest cat-gut sings
out pain and transcendence.
Pascal Quignard wrote the script from his truth-based novel. Yes, these
star-crossed musicians did live and love: although I question whether Sainte
Colombe was so deaf to non-musical sounds that he never heard his disciple
slither into the eavesdropping crawlspace under the master's garden studio.
Gem-like performances, though, in a dark jewel of a film.
A Winter's Tale has an almost terminal case of the chatters. Well-known
French winemaster Eric Rohmer removes the corks from three garrulous souls -
pretty Felicie (Charlotte Very) and the two lovers she must choose between -
and watches as they fizz like long-distance champagne bottles. Will the girl
go for middle-aged Max or pale, intellectual Loic? Or will she wait for
long-lost Charles, whom she met en vacances years before but gave the wrong
address to? (It could only happen in a Rohmer film.) Plato, Pascal and other
pensive matters are mixed in. Pleasant if non-vintage.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Arts: Rudolf Nureyev - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few dancers have so held the attention of the public, or so imposed their
image on the ballet of their time, as Rudolf Nureyev, who died yesterday.
From the moment of his leap for freedom at Orly airport in 1961, when he
fled his Soviet minders and made his sudden choice for the opportunities of
the West, Nureyev was headline news. He remained so for the rest of his
life.
He performed more, and more adventurously, than any other dancer in this
century. By force of will quite as much as by the magnetism of his stage
presence, he created a vogue for male dancing that was unprecedented in its
impact. His artistic shrewdness, blazing temperament, quick intelligence and
extraordinary physical allure were fused in an irresistible combination
which subjugated every audience. Above all else he was a star - with the
merits that attend upon such an identity, as well as the inevitable faults.
He was self-created, self-reliant. If the image was glamorous, the
dedication to dancing was unyielding, serious. When ballet companies could
not offer him the opportunities he sought, then he would generate work for
himself.
He initiated seasons and tours under the banner of 'Nureyev and Friends', in
which a sequence of guest companies and dancers revolved round the immutable
figure of Nureyev himself. He mounted the old classic ballets, in elaborate
stagings, throughout the world; starred in them, and was filmed in them. He
produced choreography - notably Romeo and Juliet; Manfred; Tancredi - in
which he was usually the star and the justification.
He danced with a multitude of ballet companies, and with modern dance
troupes, unrelenting in his quest for new roles, new challenges, new
audiences. He appeared in films - Valentino is the best known - and toured
in a revival of The King and I. As his dancing days ended, he made himself
an orchestral conductor.
Born in a train in 1938 near Irkutsk, of Tartar parentage, Nureyev became
obsessed with the idea of being a dancer while still a young boy. He
contrived to get himself to Leningrad for training, and against all the odds
of a late start as a student, he became a pupil of the great pedagogue
Alexander Pushkin. Pushkin shaped his native genius, and the rare excitement
that the young Nureyev generated on stage swiftly won him leading roles with
the Kirov Ballet.
His defection to the West in 1961 was symptomatic of Nureyev's vexed
relationship with Soviet authority, and more especially of his life-long
quest for artistic experience. He first appeared in London at a gala
organised by Margot Fonteyn in November 1961; three months later he joined
her in a performance of Giselle at Covent Garden. It launched a partnership
that was to give new impetus to Fonteyn's career (she was 20 years older
than Nureyev) and delight a world public for the next decade. The lasting
memorial to their stage relationship was Ashton's Marguerite and Armand
(1963), which captured that ardour and excitement which so thrilled
audiences.
No one company could satisfy Nureyev's eagerness for work. Throughout the
1960s and 1970s he danced with what must seem an insatiable appetite and
indomitable physical stamina, performing despite injury, racing from one
city to another to manifest himself before his worshippers. If his
interpretations remained, in some cases, mere displays of Nureyev mannerism,
his determination to honour classic dancing (he was an inspiring and
searchingly observant coach for other dancers) was an abiding virtue.
During the 1980s his obsessive performance schedule made it seem as if he
were determined to outface his own legend, his earlier self, as he battled
with roles for which he was no longer suited.
His greatest achievement during these years was his direction of the ballet
company at the Paris Opera - a notoriously intractable organisation - where
his force of personality was more than a match for the intrigues and
entrenched attitudes of the troupe. His programming was imaginative; his
leadership gave new life and lustre to a company that had seemed sunk in
arid traditionalism. In the five years between 1983 and 1988 Nureyev brought
the Opera ballet to world acclaim. His own performances, though, became more
laboured, and his final tours in 1990-91 suggested an artist unable to
accept the depredations of the years, showing a fraught presence to a public
which flocked to see what they believed was still Nureyev, but which was,
more exactly, a shadow of the great star in an unworthy setting.
Like Pavlova and Nijinsky, Nureyev captured the imagination of the world.
Countless thousands, who might otherwise never have watched ballet, saw him
dance, drawn by the magic of his name. His myth, and his manner, were
irresistible to audiences. His willingness to work unceasingly at his art,
to sacrifice everything for the rise of the curtain on a performance in
which he starred, was obsessive. He was driven by this daemon, but he served
ballet, and his vision of himself as a ballet dancer, with entire
dedication. Ballet was much richer thereby.
He was last seen in public in October, taking a curtain call after the first
night of his staging of La Bayadere for the Paris Opera ballet. He was then
clearly a very sick man but the enormous wave of admiration which came from
the audience seemed to fire his temperament yet again, and our last view of
him was of his saluting the public with a gesture of great gallantry.

An evening to suit most tastes, with sex, medicine and lashings of comedy.
The Trouble with Medicine: Code of Silence (BBC2, 9.30) explores the ethical
dilemmas raised by medical advances. Tonight the programme takes the old
dilemma, what should doctors tell patients, which has been given a sharper
edge by psychologists' claims that the success of a treatment is affected by
patients' relationships with their doctors.
The Sexual Imperative on C4 at 9.00 is the first of a six-part documentary
on sociobiology. Even if the 'selfish gene' picture of life on earth no
longer seems particularly novel, it is always useful to brush up answers to
questions like, what is altruistic behaviour? Why bother to copulate? And
are humans the only species which enjoys it?
But Thursdays ought to be really sidesplitting. The Brittas Empire returns,
a series set in a health club (BBC 1, 8.30). At 9.00, BBC 2 unwraps a new
series about marital strife in a media household, Joking Apart. A new series
of Dave Allen (ITV, 9.30) leads into Drop the Dead Donkey (C4, 10.00).

FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A patch in time to
save smokers - The race to help nicotine addicts give up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine trying to sell a product which is simultaneously highly addictive
and extremely poisonous.
Even if it doesn't sound immoral, it appears commercially absurd. After all,
sales would collapse as customers died.
Yet one of the world's best-selling products - tobacco - contains nicotine
which is both highly toxic and addictive. The cleverness of tobacco
producers has been to provide just enough nicotine to yield its medically
recognised benefits - such as stimulation of dopamine secretions in the
brain, alleviating anxiety - without fatally poisoning the addict.
No wonder then that while millions annually resolve to kick the smoking
habit, only about 10 per cent succeed in stopping for a year. Of the UK's
14m smokers, an estimated 10m want to stop. As many as 40 per cent of
British smokers try to stop the habit permanently during any one year; most
fail.
That is cheering news not just for tobacco producers but also for the newly
evangelising manufacturers of products - chewing gum and stick-on patches -
aimed at providing small doses of nicotine, enough to satisfy cravings, but
without the 2,000 or so other toxins contained in a typical puff of tobacco
smoke.
The patches are attached to the skin surface and slowly release nicotine
into the bloodstream.
In the US, with 50m smokers, the leading brands are Nicoderm (from Marion
Merrell Dow), Habitrol (Ciba-Geigy), Nicotrol (Warner-Lambert) and Pro-Step
(American Cyanamid).
Advertising Age, a trade magazine, calculates that their combined sales
could have reached Dollars 900m (Pounds 592m) in 1992, with advertising
support of Dollars 100m, 'the most ever spent on consumer advertising of a
prescription drug'.
In the UK three brands of patch have been available without prescription
since the end of 1992. Kabi Pharmacia is using the cartoon figure (below) to
market Nicorette, Ciba-Geigy is selling Nicotinell, and Marion Merrell Dow
is promoting its brand, Nicabate.
A three-month course for each retails from between Pounds 147.54 to Pounds
182.76, less than the daily price of 20 cigarettes.
Industry estimates suggest that this year's market could be worth Pounds
30m-50m. Kabi Pharmacia, which in 1991 gained UK approval to switch its
Nicorette chewing gum from prescription-only status to an over-the-counter
product, saw retail sales of the gum treble to Pounds 20m in 1992, which it
believes is partly a result of easier availability.
The US sales/advertising ratio is likely to be repeated in the UK; certainly
Ciba-Geigy and Kabi Pharmacia are spending in excess of Pounds 3m on their
current advertising campaigns.
Reports from the UK's 13,000 dispensing pharmacies are encouraging for all
three brands.
Some anti-smoking charities, however, are concerned that smokers may be
misled by the marketing and that, ultimately, they may remain nicotine
addicts.
Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, notes that 'they are relatively expensive,
particularly for the heaviest smoking groups which coincidentally are also
the lowest income groups, and their success rates are questionable.
'Stopping smoking requires willpower. US research suggests that 90 per cent
of successful ex-smokers quit without any formal help, because they have the
motivation to do so.'
Meanwhile, for those smokers who dislike both gum and patch, a further
weaning device is just around the corner; the nicotine nasal spray.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Aluminium industry
shows its metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium has been around since the early 1800s, but industry in general
remains woefully ignorant about the uses of the metal. It is a condition
which Brian Turner, president of the Aluminium Federation in the UK,
describes as 'one of the appalling educational failures of recent decades'.
The European aluminium industry is belatedly setting out to rectify the
position with a Pounds 1m programme aimed at educational institutions and
industries that use the metal.
Geoff Budd, the UK project manager, says the programmes should end the days
of lecturers telling students: 'Aluminium is roughly the same as steel, but
a bit more difficult.' He points out that undergraduate mechanical engineers
were provided with no information about aluminium 30 years ago and were
still not being taught about it last year.
Under a European Commission programme known as Comett ll, the aluminium
industries in nine EC and European Free Trade Association countries and 25
universities are setting out to put aluminium on the educational map. The EC
is providing about one third of the Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) cost, while
the universities are contributing their time. The industry is footing the
rest of the bill, mainly through the UK's Aluminium Federation, Germany's
Aluminium-Zentrale and SkanAluminium in the Nordic countries.
The Aluminium Training Partnership (ATP) provides the link between the
industry and the universities. The second and most important project is
known as Talat, an acronym for Training for Aluminium Application
Technologies.
Its objective is to produce 150 hours of teaching material covering five
aluminium application technology areas at three levels of attainment. The
subject areas being targeted are aluminium materials technology; design;
manufacturing and forming; joining technology; and surface technology.
For each subject one or more groups of university partners have been formed,
each with specialist contacts in the industry. They aim to produce lectures
suitable for courses in nearly all the relevant areas of technical
education.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Technology: To spray or not to spray - Should chemical
dispersants be used to clean up the Shetland oil spill? Clive Cookson
examines the debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the storm around Shetland begins to abate, arguments are raging about the
wisdom of using chemicals and biological agents to clean up the 85,000
tonnes of crude oil spewing out of the stricken tanker Braer.
On the one hand are environmental groups and local fishermen who argue that
the best policy is to let nature take its course, however slowly, because
materials introduced to break up the oil more quickly may do more harm than
the spill itself.
On the other hand, government agencies and the oil industry feel that public
opinion requires them to take action - a policy of doing as little as
possible would not be acceptable. They are encouraged by companies promoting
products and services designed to clean up pollution.
Official UK policy is to rely on chemical dispersants as a first line of
attack on spills, with mechanical methods of oil recovery playing a
secondary role. As the US congressional Office of Technology Assessment
pointed out in a recent report on oil spill policies, the British approach
contrasts with many other countries that rely primarily on mechanical
equipment. This includes floating booms to contain the slick, skimmers which
remove the oil from the sea surface and pumps to suck it back into clean-up
vessels.
But the Department of Transport's Marine Pollution Control Unit argues that
the rough seas and stormy weather typical of the British Isles make it
difficult to use mechanical methods. And recent advances in dispersants have
made them less toxic than 10 or 20 years ago, when such chemicals were much
more poisonous than the oil they were meant to break up.
Yesterday the MPCU's six Dakota aircraft sprayed the slick around Braer with
120 tonnes of dispersants - chemicals related to the surfactants
incorporated in domestic detergents and washing-up liquids.
Andrew Lees, Friends of the Earth campaigns director, condemned the spraying
as likely to aggravate the disaster. It would cause oil droplets to
agglomerate in the top few metres of the sea, where they could poison
organisms that would not be affected by an untreated slick. 'The glamour
factor shouldn't be overlooked - television pictures of the minister
standing on the cliff and Dakotas coming in to save the day,' he said.
Dispersants need to be sprayed within two or three days of a spillage if
they are to work effectively, because the oil becomes more viscous and
therefore less susceptible to chemical attack as its more volatile
components evaporate.
When it comes to the longer term strategy for cleaning thick black gunge off
Shetland's coastline, the main controversy is likely to involve
bioremediation - using micro-organisms to devour pollutants. The technology
has been developed over the last five years or so. It takes advantage of the
fact that some bacteria have evolved to convert the hydrocarbons in oil into
carbon dioxide and water (the microbes normally live off the seepages of oil
and tar which occur quite widely in nature).
Bioremediation was first applied on a large oil spill after the 1989 Exxon
Valdez disaster, when a 70-mile stretch of Alaskan shoreline was sprayed
with fertilisers containing phosphorous and nitrogen compounds in an attempt
to provide more nutrients for the natural oil-eating bacteria. The US
Environmental Protection Agency said last year that the exercise had
successfully speeded up the oil's disappearance without harmful side-effects
but it admitted there was no scientific proof that it had made any
difference. Much of the Alaskan clean-up was accomplished by mechanical and
manual methods; teams of volunteers and paid workers removed tonnes of
contaminated sand and scrubbed thousands of rocks by hand.
Then in 1990 bioremediation was used to combat the spillage of 5.1m gallons
of crude oil from the Mega Borg into the Gulf of Mexico. The clean-up team
sprayed a mixture of oil-consuming bacteria and nutrients directly on to the
slick in the open sea. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the Texas Water Commission said in a report two months
ago that the spill's environmental impact had been minimal but again there
was no clear evidence about the effect of bioremediation.
International Bioremediation Services, a UK company based in the West
Midlands, wants to use its cocktail of nine bacterial strains - shown in
laboratory tests at the University of Wolverhampton to have a voracious
appetite for Norwegian crude oil - on the Shetland coast.
Artur Haslimann, IBS chairman, says the product has successfully tackled oil
spillages of up to 65,000 gallons on land, lakes and rivers. It could clean
up beaches contaminated by the Braer 'within months' even if the oil had
sunk deep into the ground, he says. 'When their food source has gone, the
bacteria die and there is no further problem with them.'
However, environmentalists are not convinced that the benefits of
bioremediation outweigh its risks. They are concerned about the ecological
effect not only of increased microbial levels but also of the nutrients
applied with them, which could stimulate the growth of unwanted organisms
such as slimy green algae.
'We're wary too of the 'magic bullet' philosophy, according to which it
doesn't really matter what gets spilled because designer bugs can always
come in and sort it out for you.' Lees says. 'Far better to put more effort
into preventing the disaster happening in the first place.'

FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Weathering the storm
 -Boat builders must pay closer attention to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sailing and the sea may course through the British bloodstream, but UK
attempts to build and sell boats to the mass market have been anaemic at
best.
That is the opinion of Tony Beechey, the new executive chairman of the
British Marine Industries Federation, the trade group representing the
Pounds 1bn a year industry.
Beechey's own recent experiences of shopping for a middle-sized yacht at
last autumn's Southampton Boat Show have only reinforced his opinions. The
first boat he liked was all teak and brass fittings. But it cost three times
what Beechey wanted to pay.
The second was plainer but was over-specified and cost twice what he wanted
to spend. The third was well-designed, functional, just right for price -
and imported from the US.
Beechey is passionate in arguing that Britain's high international
reputation in the marine field must be grafted on to volume production of
affordable products.
Specialising in profitable niche markets as bespoke boat builder to the
world's wealthy does not appeal to this plain-spoken Midlander.
'All this Burberry and Jaguar approach doesn't employ many people, does it?'
he asks rhetorically. 'It's peripheral. As a nation we're wearing Pakamacs
not Burberrys. Since coming home six months ago, I've seen Britain as an
outsider and I don't like a lot of what I see in industry.
'We tend in Britain to build products that go beyond what is necessary. It's
very visible with cars. The last really good high-volume vehicle we produced
was the Mini,' said Beechey. 'We need to educate ourselves about what things
are really used for as opposed to what they stand for.'
He speaks as a businessman who has spent most of the past decade in American
industry. In 1980 he became managing director of Ward White Retail in the UK
and in 1986 was appointed president of Hofheimer, its largest US subsidiary.
Beechey's early career, after graduating in economics from Hull University,
was spent as a graduate trainee with Procter &amp; Gamble.
Living on the edge of the Chesapeake Bay at Norfolk, Virginia, it was
virtually inevitable that Beechey would buy a boat - a small Bayliner, the
Ford Escort of the floating world. Within a few years he was hooked,
changing vessels every few years.
'People scoff at the Bayliner but if you're a beginner you don't want to
spend big money on something complex in a hobby you might not take to,' says
Beechey. 'I don't yet see anyone building that entry-level boat in this
country.'
Overall, the BMIF's members have suffered a fall in turnover of close to 25
per cent since the recession began. Workboats and commercial craft have,
understandably, held up far better than the leisure sector.
Yet there are bright spots. In the waterless area around of Kidderminster,
Beechey recently stumbled across a small company working flat out on small
motor cruisers.
'That owner doesn't want to talk about being a boat builder. He's got a
production line that must build efficiently and cheaply,' enthuses Beechey.
'Britain has become deficient at understanding the relationship between
production and volume.'
Yet the BMIF's 1,400 members range from one-man brokerages to public
companies building multi-million pound motor yachts.
The industry has always attracted more than its quota of dreamers and
escapists. What man capable of holding a power-drill hasn't once dreamed of
escaping the rat-race to run a boatyard up some sun-dappled creek?
'It's certainly a very fragmented industry,' agrees Beechey tactfully. 'Some
of the smaller members, perhaps with a family business building a couple of
boats a year, don't want growth.' His philosophy will be simply to offer
resources to those that do.
These will range from offering additional export advice to new in-house
technical certification staff who should be able to help members get their
products through the official process more quickly.
One problem the BMIF does not have is the wretched situation of trying to
grow out of its members' pockets.
Subscription income is matched two-fold by revenue from leading boat shows -
including London and Southampton - which the Federation owns via its
National Boat Shows subsidiary.
'Someone back in the 1950s made a first-class decision to keep these assets
within the industry. Its our major shop-window as well as being profitable,'
explained Beechey. The BMIF's own annual turnover is around Pounds 7.5m.
This year will see the first boat show dedicated to inland waterways, held
at Nottingham.
Trade stand bookings have begun to outstrip supply, indicating the enormous
growth of the canal and river sector - despite the recession.
If it overturns the preconceptions of the 'blazeraati' as they sip pink gins
at Cowes and dream of varnished mahogany, Beechey could not be happier.
'It's way overdue and its going to be a huge success,' he chortles. 'We've
got to get the boats out of the south of England.'

FT  07 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Resolving to move towards a truer and
fairer view - Andrew Jack calls for further improvement among those
responsible for financial reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE 1993 gets too far under way, it is a good moment to reflect on the
disappointing state of financial reporting - and for those involved to
resolve to try harder this year.
After two years of corporate collapses against a backdrop of accounts that
provided their readers with all too few clues of what was to come, it would
be hard to deny improvements must be made.
The last few months have brought considerable change, notably through the
work of the Accounting Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Review
Panel, the Auditing Practices Board, the joint ethics committee of the
professional accountancy bodies, and the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance.
But more work needs to be done. Here are a few suggestions for those who
produce accounts - and for those who use them.
Finance directors and their boards. Both logic and the law - which do not
always correspond - suggest that directors are the individuals responsible
for preparing a company's accounts and ensuring that they show a 'true and
fair' view.
All too often, the question 'Where were the auditors?' is unfairly posed -
if only by those tempted to seek legal redress against professionals with
deep pockets - when blame should be more correctly focused on those within
the company.
Directors have the power, the access, the information and the responsibility
to act on behalf of shareholders as custodians of the assets of a business.
It is their actions which determine its direction and management.
Yet the level of financial literacy is often poor. A survey by KPMG Peat
Marwick last year suggested that one-third of managers did not understand
the meaning of the profit and loss account.
Auditors and accountants. The secretive world of the accountancy firms
becomes especially close-lipped at the mention of professional incompetence,
complacency or complicity. But accountants cannot be allowed to escape a
good share of the blame.
Legal obligations, professional guidelines and years of training should all
help them to ensure that accounts are accurately prepared and fairly
presented for the benefit of their real client: the shareholder.
Yet all too frequently auditors treat the directors of the company as the
client. It is the board which sacks, appoints and pays the auditors, meets
the audit partner, negotiates the wording of the audit report, receives the
management letter and hears details that never reach the ears of the
shareholder.
That places auditors under commercial and personal pressures that sit
uneasily with their impartial role, particularly at a time when accountancy
firms have become more business-oriented, marketing-driven and competitive
with one another.
Privately, auditors will talk about the fear of being sued or of losing the
client at least as much as about whether they agree with the treatment of
the accounts the directors request.
A tendency towards out-of-court settlements denies the public the details
surrounding auditors' judgments and actions. Even so, some embarrassing
evidence is now beginning to come to light.
It is more difficult for auditors to defend themselves when they have given
unqualified opinions on the growing number of accounts now being censured by
the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
The government. Accountancy is too important to be left to accountants. But
legislators seem to believe it is either too boring or too technical to
warrant their attention.
They have persistently turned their backs on the subject and left the
profession to draw up standards and to regulate itself. That may seem a more
efficient approach, but it risks pandering to self-interest.
There is little legislation covering financial reporting. What there is has
tended to be introduced only in response to compliance with EC directives.
It is inconsistent, incomplete and often inflexible.
There is also little case law to set precedents and give guidance. If
nothing else, clarification should be provided on what the Companies' acts
mean by 'a true and fair view'; and there should be a re-examination of the
Caparo judgment on the nature of auditors' responsibility. And too little
attention has been given to the question of whether it is desirable for the
profession to be the ultimate - and potentially unlimited - target of legal
action after every crash.
Analysts and institutional investors. Skilled readers of accounts cannot be
directly blamed for the figures that are presented to them. But they must
take responsibility for sloppy interpretation - particularly when they are
handling or advising on the use of other people's money.
There is little doubt that there are wide variations in analysts' ability to
read and understand accounts. Why else do company share prices so often seem
to drop after accounting changes - which are purely presentational - are
announced?
The attention analysts and investors pay to short-term returns and to the
bottom-line earnings figure has also played a strong part in encouraging a
superficial reading of accounts - and the manipulation of the figure by
companies.
Professional investors and analysts must also share blame for not lobbying
for reform more actively. Very few submissions for or against proposals
suggested by the Accounting Standards Board have come from City investment
institutions and brokers, for instance.
Standards-setters and watchdogs. Historically, standards have clearly
allowed far too much flexibility. All that is changing with the work of the
Accounting Standards Board, which has been widely welcomed. But the ASB's
honeymoon is coming to an end. This year will see how far it can face up to
opposition on controversial issues such as intangible assets, acquisition
provisions and valuations.
Critics have started to point out ambiguities with its new financial
reporting standards on cash flow and the profit and loss account. Companies
have begun to squeeze through loopholes in the recent rulings of the ASB's
urgent issues task force.
There are questions over the speed with which the ASB will be able to tackle
the vast number of topics demanding reform. It plans to introduce only two
new standards this year; its full agenda could well stretch through several
more economic cycles.
Financial journalists. Those who write and broadcast for a wide audience of
investors cannot escape from criticism. Time pressures and lack of
specialist training limit coverage of financial reports and accounting
issues.
The availability of comprehensive preliminary results has led to a tendency
to pay little attention to the final, audited annual accounts a few weeks
later. Often, vital clues to a company's subsequent problems can be found in
the notes to the accounts - yet these receive only cursory scrutiny.
Individual investors. Recent surveys of private shareholders have shown that
few have any faith in the quality of information published in accounts. Yet
an equally small proportion appears to understand the details that they
contain or to spend time studying the most important parts of the accounts,
such as the notes.
Large numbers of investors have elected to receive the grossly insufficient
information which is contained in the summary financial statements companies
are now allowed to circulate in place of full accounts. Does this really
provide a satisfactory basis for investing?

FT  07 JAN 93 / People: Zographos' new commercial break
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meridian Broadcasting, the new ITV company for the south and south east of
England is losing its finance director Stratis Zographos within days of
going on air.
He has been poached by Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Network
Centre, which will be responsible for commissioning ITV's network schedule,
to be its first commercial director. Stratis will be responsible for
programme budgets in excess of Pounds 500m a year.
Since 1984, Stratis, who was born in Eritrea of Greek parents but who has
lived in the UK for 30 years, presided with skill and humour over the
accumulating cash pile at TV-am. The breakfast station that lost its
franchise would have accumulated Pounds 50m by the end of the year had it
not been for last month's Pounds 26m distribution to shareholders.
The new job means that for a brief period Zographos, who is 48, will hold
three senior broadcasting jobs. Until the end of March he is still
technically director of finance at TV-am and then there will be the handover
period between Meridian and the ITV Network Centre.
Although Zographos says he is moving to the Network Centre because of the
challenge of helping ITV make more efficient and cost-effective programmes,
he also says: 'I'm not talking about cost-cutting. The last thing I want to
do is harm production values on the screen. The viewer has to come first.'
He worked a video editing machine during the dispute at TV-am.
Before moving to TV-am, Zographos worked for a range of companies including
Conoco, Valor Group, Muraspec and Fobel International. But television is his
business now. 'I really love this industry,' he says.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Power plan aims for stable prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY prices would become less variable from year to year and might
fall under 'system support' proposals announced yesterday by National Grid,
manager of the electricity system in England and Wales.
National Grid wants to set up a series of hedging contracts with the
generators and regional electricity companies that would stabilise the
'uplift' payments made by Recs - and indirectly by customers - to ensure
that electricity demands are met.
Uplift charges are a mark-up added to the price of electricity to pay for
the administration and running of the pool in which it is traded. They
accounted for Pounds 475m, or 3 per cent of electricity prices, last year.
Their unpredictability is one reason why bills to customers have been
adjusted retrospectively in recent years.
National Grid's proposals follow a report by Offer, the electricity industry
regulator, which ordered a review of the way the grid pays for electricity
from some power stations.
Offer identified 14 power stations that made Pounds 200m in extra profits in
the year to end March 1992, a 70 per cent increase on the previous year.
In the electricity pool system, power stations bid a price and National Grid
calls in the cheapest plants.
To keep electricity flowing in certain areas at times of peak demand, other
plants are occasionally required, even if they are not the cheapest
available. Those plants often levy high charges, contributing to uplift.
National Grid admits that it has no profit incentive to reduce uplift costs.
It suggests that from April it should set up a service under which regional
electricity companies would pay a fixed amount for expected uplift charges.
In turn, it could sign a series of contracts with generators. There would be
incentives for the generators to perform according to the grid's
instructions, in place of the present looser arrangements.
National Grid would make profits or losses on the service, although they
would be capped in the contracts. It would thus have an incentive to reduce
uplift, by, for instance, managing the load through contracts with large
customers, or through improving the transmission system.
Mr Tony White, National Grid head of transmission business development, said
expensive plant would be used less, potentially reducing charges.

FT  07 JAN 93 / People: Chairman for Aitken Hume Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Brown, who retired from Standard Chartered in 1991 having joined the
Chartered Bank back in 1954, is taking on the chairmanship of Aitken Hume
Bank; he also becomes a non-executive director of the parent, banking and
fund management group Aitken Hume International. He succeeds Stuart Graham,
a past chief general manager and group chief executive of Midland Bank, who
is retiring at 71.
Brown spent 30 years in the Far East, mostly in Hong Kong but with spells in
Japan, Singapore and Thailand. He returned to London when Rodney Galpin
moved from the Bank of England to become chairman and chief executive of
Standard Chartered in 1988. Brown's last executive role before retiring at
60 was as deputy chairman, but he is still on the board in a non-exec-utive
capacity.
He describes Aitken Hume Bank, which specialises in private banking, as a
natural fit for him. 'Most of my good friends are high net worth individuals
from overseas territories.' Aitken Hume International's major shareholders
are Lee Ming Tee of Hong Kong and Syrian-born businessman Wafic Said.
Since retiring, Brown has also taken up non-executive positions at the
Korean Export/Import Bank and at Hong Kong Investment Trust, part of the
Jupiter Tyndall stable. He will be part-time, spending two or three days a
fortnight there, according to the bank.
In the past the group has been beset by management upheaval; in the
mid-1980s Timothy Aitken was ousted from the board. His cousin and
co-founder Jonathan Aitken stepped down from the deputy chairmanship when he
became defence procurement minister after the last election. Brown says he
believes the group is back on 'an even keel - otherwise I wouldn't have
joined.'
He points to a new management team in place, including David Griffith, who
joined last February and took on the new role of managing director of the
bank in April, and Bruce Robinson, who joined as a director in June.
In November, Aitken Hume put out a statement that it was in talks with a
potential bidder - assumed at the time to be one of the principal
shareholders - but has not commented further. Brown, who says he was
approached by Graham about the job and had already agreed to take it on
before the bid announcement, reckons his position is unlikely to be affected
whatever the outcome.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Manchester Airport traffic grows 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASSENGER traffic through Manchester Airport grew by nearly 15 per cent in
1992, resuming the rapid development that made it Europe's fastest-growing
airport before the 1991 Gulf war curtailed air travel.
Official figures to be issued today are expected to show that about 12.4m
passengers used the airport last year compared with 10.8m in 1991.
'We think this is tremendous, considering the recession,' Mr Gil Thompson,
the airport's chief executive, said yesterday.
Its passenger figures compare with about 19m for Gatwick and 40m for
Heathrow, but controversial plans for a second runway within five years are
likely to push Manchester towards 30m passengers a year and about 12th place
in the world's airports league.
The second runway is being vigorously opposed by local residents and
environmental groups but the airport's owners - the 10 borough councils of
Greater Manchester - say up to 50,000 new jobs would be generated.
British Rail laid the last length of track this week to the airport's new
rail terminal, which starts operation in May, providing the airport's first
rail link with Manchester city centre.
Manchester's new Pounds 570m Terminal Two will open in March, the first step
towards increasing the airport's capacity to 23m people. All long-haul
traffic except British Airways services will transfer to the new terminal,
which will initially handle about 6m passengers a year.
The existing Terminals A and B will be renamed Terminals 1 and 1A. British
Airways will continue to use them for its domestic, Continental and
long-haul services alongside other short-haul UK and Continental operators.
The split between charter and scheduled traffic remains about 60-40 in
favour of the former, but the airport now boasts 94 airlines serving 165
destinations.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Boat industry takes hopeful soundings: Richard Gourlay
reports that traditional Earls Court optimism has a ring of truth this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past four weeks, Marine Projects of Plymouth has sold three 65-ft
motor yachts at Pounds 650,000 each to Dutch, German and French clients.
At the other end of the scale, Hunter Boats of Essex reports that sales of
yachts at about Pounds 40,000 have picked up in the past three months.
After two battering years, exhibitors descending on Earls Court for this
week's London Boat Show will cling to such anecdotes. For the first time
since the market peaked in 1990, though, the optimism that is a fixture of
the show carries a ring of truth.
'There is reason to believe that we have hit bottom in the UK,' says Mr
David King, managing director of Marine Projects. 'We do now have a market
in the UK, whereas going back three months there was no market at all.'
Such signs of recovery remain faint and are not evident across the industry.
Many chandlers are facing great difficulties and have not even enjoyed the
benefit of owners re-equipping rather than trading in their boats.
Marina operators, who have lost some of boating's 1980s newcomers - or were
too late attracting them - are continuing to suffer as much as any company
in the property sector.
But builders with export markets have received a boost from the devaluation
of sterling in September. The greatest beneficiaries are likely to be the
large motor boat builders - Sunseekers, Marine Projects and Fairline Boats.
Smaller operators, in what has always been a highly fragmented industry, are
less likely to be able to bear the cost of exporting and will have to wait
for UK demand to pick up.
Devaluation will also reduce import penetration from continental Europe, in
particular from Scandinavia and Belgium, and from US companies, which some
UK builders say took advantage of an overvalued pound.
Nevertheless, there are storm clouds gathering over the industry in the very
countries that have helped keep the builders afloat. Exports already
accounted for Pounds 139m of total leisure boat sales of Pounds 238m in
1991. Now the vitality of some of those foreign markets is threatened.
Japan's economic troubles have drastically cut demand that was beginning to
take off after a switch in fashion away from golf. The downturn in the
German economy is threatening UK builders' largest single export market,
although so far they have not seen any fall in demand.
The last two years of recession has brought one clear benefit from UK boat
builders' point of view. In the 1980s, French boat builders, led by Beneteau
and Jeaneau, made great inroads into the traditional UK builders' market
share. They appeared to provide what the new rich wanted from their sailing.
That new mass market has now disappeared and British industry watchers
believe that French market share has fallen with it. As one UK builder
disparagingly says: 'The newcomers were attracted by the kind of boats that
sold well at boat shows' - where the French flourished.
If the rot in the UK industry has indeed been stopped, it would not be
before time. Many builders, such as Fairline and Marine Projects, have
trimmed their work-forces.
Some have lost 40 per cent of production over the past two years. Many more
have either gone out of business entirely or, like Westerly of Portsmouth,
have returned via the liquidators in much slimmed-down form.
Fairline, the only quoted boatbuilder in the UK, made a Pounds 500,000 loss
in the year to September and halved its dividend, although it booked a
record number of orders in November.
Sales by the industry as a whole, including leisure and commercial
boatbuilders, marina operators, sailmakers and suppliers of electronic
equipment, has shrunk by more than 25 per cent in two years.
In 1991 sales fell 19 per cent to Pounds 1.122bn with motor and sailing
yachts falling 16 per cent, according to the British Marine Industries
Federation.
Mr Tony Beechey, the federation's executive chairman, believes the fall
continued last year but at a slower pace, while 1993 will see overall sales
on a similar level. Equipment sales, however, have remained buoyant with
sales in 1991 of Pounds 284m, much of it exported.
As the boating industry gathered in London yesterday, there was even a
degree of optimism surrounding the European Commission's closure last month
of the much-used loophole that allowed buyers of boats to avoid paying value
added tax. 'The worst part of the VAT issue has been the lack of decisions
from Brussels,' says Mr Beechey.
No one is quite sure how sales will be affected. Some of the more bullish
salesmen are using VAT as part of the sales pitch. In a classic
demonstration of clutching at straws, one builder says the chancellor could
solve his funding problems by raising VAT rates in the spring. To avoid the
increase, yachtsmen should buy now.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Labour PR campaign gains backbench boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR campaigners for electoral reform will receive a boost today with the
publication of a poll showing that two out of three of the party's MPs who
first took their seats after last year's election back some form of
proportional representation for the Commons.
The findings, taken from soundings by New Statesman and Society magazine of
52 of the 69 new MPs, appear to counter the view that the tide within the
parliamentary party is turning against change from the first-past-the-post
system.
The findings come on the eve of a two-day meeting in London of the party's
committee on electoral systems, which is set to examine elections to the
Commons for the first time.
The committee, chaired by Lord Plant, is divided over the issue, which PR
supporters are presenting as a litmus test of the party's readiness to take
radical steps to modernise and reform.
Last month Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader, came out for the first
time in favour of electoral reform after years of avoiding taking a public
stance on the question.
Some leading shadow cabinet figures closely associated with the modernising
faction in the party - including Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, and
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor - have appeared increasingly sceptical of
PR. Mr John Smith, the leader, has refused to state his position.
The Plant committee is expected to submit a policy recommendation on the
issue to the national executive committee, possibly by March. But senior
party officials have indicated that a definitive leadership position may be
unlikely until after the local government elections in May.
The poll shows that 34 of the 52 MPs back reform. Thirteen were against and
five undecided. It is accompanied by a passionately argued article by Mr
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and a long-time advocate of
PR, warning that reform is vital to Labour's bid to return to office.
'There is no long-term future for Labour as a party of government if it
cannot re-establish local representation in the areas of fastest population
growth in the south, and there is no serious prospect of doing so without
PR,' he writes.
While criticising the handling of the issue during the 1992 election
campaign, Mr Cook points out that Labour won more votes in southern England
than in its heartlands in northern England, Yorkshire and Scotland yet
'ended up with only three Labour MPs to show for it'.
Meanwhile, opponents of PR claim that a majority of Labour MPs are opposed
to change, particularly after the Liberal Democrats' failure to join them in
voting against the government in the Maastricht treaty 'paving' debate in
November.
Mr Jeff Rooker MP, chairman of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, is
planning to table a compromise proposal to the Plant committee aimed at
introducing a modified version of the Additional Member System, used in
Germany.
Under Mr Rooker's scheme, some 500 seats would continue to be elected on the
current basis, but 150 more would be allocated at regional level to 'best
losers' from other parties under a formula weighted to reflect each party's
overall electoral performance.
Any final decision on electoral systems will have to be approved by the
party conference in the autumn.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Supermarkets have good season's sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO and Kwik Save, the grocery chains, said yesterday they had traded well
over Christmas. They added to the growing belief among industry observers
that December was better than expected for food retailers.
Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco, said the group had seen
like-for-like sales growth in its existing stores of 1.5 per cent, and total
sales growth, including new stores, of 9.5 per cent, over the four weeks to
January 2.
That was a 1-point improvement on the 8.5 per cent sales growth disclosed by
the company in its interim results in September.
Analysts said Tesco's announcement followed reports of like-for-like sales
growth of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for J. Sainsbury; 3 per cent for
Argyll - owner of the Safeway chain - and 6.5 per cent for Wm Morrison.
Gateway is also believed to have surpassed its budget.
'From our point of view, it's very good news,' Mr Reid said. He added that
the figures would help to dispel rumours that performance had been
disappointing at Tesco's new stores.
Mr Reid added: 'But we would not want to over-hype things as to whether
recovery is on the way. You can get flurries at Budget time and at
Christmas.'
Mr Bill Currie, analyst with brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'It does
seem that food retailers saw a general pick-up over Christmas.'
BZW has upgraded its 1992 pre-tax profit forecasts for Tesco from Pounds
570m to Pounds 580m, and for J. Sainsbury from Pounds 735m to Pounds 740m.
Mr Keith Lovell, group finance and planning director with Kwik Save, the
discount food chain, said Christmas trading had been 'satisfactory, up to
expectations'.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Pound gives chancellor new year cheer: The reasons for
sterling's recent rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND'S rise this week has given Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, an
unexpected new year present.
It provides a more favourable background for further interest rate cuts,
which may be needed to generate UK growth, and helps in the Treasury's
battle against inflation.
Sterling's strength may also help Mr Lamont to claim that the currency is
regaining some of the confidence of international investors that was lost
last September as a result of Britain's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The pound closed in London last night at DM2.52 against the D-Mark, up 1
pfennig, and little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.542 after a
sharp rise on Tuesday. It was also much stronger on its trade-weighted
index, which measures it against a basket of currencies, and which rose from
81.2 to 81.7.
The longer-term outlook for the pound is still uncertain in spite of the
strong performance of recent days.
It is still too early to talk about the pound shrugging off the tribulations
of the past six months. Sterling enjoyed a similar rally against the D-Mark
in mid December, only to fall back a few days later. The outlook for
sterling's exchange rate against the dollar also looks much less favourable
than its prospects against the D-Mark.
Against the German currency there are predictions that sterling may rise as
high as DM2.70 later this year if the Bundesbank cuts German interest rates
to halt the country's slide into recess-ion. But the dollar appears well set
for a strong rally against European currencies in 1993. Given the large
fiscal deficit in the US, economic activity will probably be funded by large
inflows into the US currency. Against that background, Mr Ian Beauchamp,
chief economist at Hambros Bank in London, believes the sterling/dollar rate
might soon be back at Dollars 1.40.
Nevertheless, the main factors behind the pound's rise in recent days look
reasonably solid. Investors have bought sterling partly because of the
increasing turbulence inside the European exchange rate mechanism, and the
possibility that the French franc may have to be devalued.
The pound's weakness since Black Wednesday was caused partly by the UK
government's cuts in interest rates, which give investors a smaller return
for holding the UK currency. But the prospect of a devaluation of the franc
or a cut in German interest rates now makes sterling look like a temporary
safe haven in Europe.
'There is a small risk of a 5 or 6 per cent devaluation of the French
currency later this year,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at
UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'That devaluation would undermine the
higher return that investors now get for holding francs instead of pounds.'
Investors have also bought sterling for other currencies because of
increasing evidence that the UK economy may be recovering after its long-est
recession since the 1930s.
Indications of a significant rise in shop sales last month, together with a
large 3 per cent year-on-year rise in the M0 money supply in December, have
provided some support for theories about a modest rise in consumer spending.
In industry, concrete signs of any recovery are harder to spot. Order books
have remained thin in spite of the confidence-boosting measures announced by
Mr Lamont in the Autumn Statement.
However, many companies can reasonably expect to step up UK sales this year
as the economy benefits from the 3-percentage-point cut in base rates,
bringing them to 7 per cent since the pound's ERM exit.
Another factor attracting investors is that Britain's economy is starting to
look more robust than elsewhere in Europe, even though UK growth this year
is likely to be modest.
With German growth in 1993 expected to be no more than 0.5 per cent - and
with Italy and France also expect to see only a weak economic expansion over
the next 12 months - the increase in UK output of 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent
that many economists predict for this year looks reasonably healthy.

FT  07 JAN 93 / County Hall hotel proposal approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAMBETH Council has approved a planning application by Shirayama Corporation
of Japan to turn County Hall, the former headquarters of the Greater London
Council, into a hotel.
Lambeth's planning committee gave permission subject to further
consideration later this month of the community benefits the developer will
provide.
The developer plans to convert the main building, which is across the River
Thames from the Houses of Parliament, into a 600-bed hotel with conference
and leisure facilities.
Shirayama says it will keep all the historic rooms intact and 'brought back
to their original splendour'. There will be a chapel and a health club in
the basement and a 24-hour public restaurant on the riverside terrace.
The council was advised to accept the planning application for several
reasons, including the need for high-quality hotel accommodation in London
and the employment potential.

TRIPS to the UK by overseas visitors totalled 15.4m for the first 10 months

The number of visits from western Europe was the highest ever for the first

WORLDWIDE sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars fell by a fifth last year
from 1,723 to 1,378 - nearly 60 per cent lower than the record 3,300 sales
reached in 1990.
But their manufacturer, Crewe-based Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said yesterday
sales had begun to show signs of an upturn in the last quarter.
'Most markets are now showing signs of limited recovery after one of the
most difficult years in our company's history,' said Mr Peter Ward, chairman

THE IRA claimed responsibility yesterday for planting incendiary devices
that exploded in four central London stores.
The pre-dawn explosions caused serious damage to one shop and followed
telephoned warnings to the BBC and Sky TV of 'numerous bombs' in the
capital.
No one was hurt in the attacks and Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square, which
were closed while police searched for more devices, were re-opened before
yesterday's morning rush hour. Three devices exploded in stores in Oxford
Street, while another caused damage to a bookshop in The Strand.

CONTRIBUTIONS towards a Pounds 23,000 legal bill incurred by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, for evicting a 'sex therapist' from his London house
are to be scrutinised by two MP committees next week, David Owen writes.
On Tuesday, the committee on members' interests will consider a draft report
drawn up by Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, its Tory chairman, about the
handling of a contribution of more than Pounds 18,000 from an anonymous Tory
benefactor.
On Wednesday, the public accounts committee is expected to turn its
attention to aspects of a Treasury payment of Pounds 4,700 towards the bill.
Mr Robert Sheldon, the committee's Labour chairman, said yesterday he would
be 'putting a proposition' to the cross-party body next Wednesday. Committee
members expect to be handed a report by the National Audit Office on the
matter at that meeting.

NAMES ON two Lloyd's syndicates face significantly worse 1989 losses than
previously feared.
Spratt &amp; White syndicate 475 and Evennett syndicate 1035, both specialising
in catastrophe reinsurance business, have reported a signifi-cant
deterioration in their results as claims from hurricane Hugo and other heavy
losses continue to mount.
Syndicate 475, now part of the Knightstone Group, has suffered worst, with
losses for 956 Names - the individuals whose capital supports the market -
likely to exceed Pounds 125m, more than 500 per cent of the syndicate's
capacity. Capacity is the amount of premium a syndicate is permitted to
underwrite.
On Evennett syndicate 1035, 1,149 Names face losses equal to 150 per cent of
its capacity of Pounds 21.9m, or about Pounds 30m. The accounts of both
syndicates were left open last year - when Lloyd's declared overall losses
of Pounds 2.06bn - because of uncertainty about the level of future claims.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Unions move closer to merger ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN union in British Telecom and its opposite number in the Post Office
are expected to hold a merger ballot at the end of 1994 after several years
of talks.
The National Communications Union and the Union of Communication Workers
have been discussing since 1988 the formation of a larger union representing
more than 300,000 communication workers, but the talks have intensified over
the past few months.
A proposal recommending the ballot will be put to both unions at their
annual conferences this year, and if it succeeds, a ballot on the merger
will be held in autumn 1994.
The move comes among widespread union attempts to amalgamate to gain
financial and bargaining strength. Some have moved in the direction of large
general unions while others have sought mergers on industrial lines.
Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the NCU, said: 'Mr Alan Johnson, general
secretary of the UCW, and I see this as an opportunity to form a
communications-based union. Since our respective conferences last May and
June we have been finding areas of agreement on significant parts of the new
structure including the executive.'
He said although the majority of the NCU's members worked in BT and the
majority of the UCW's were employed by the Post Office, both had an
important group of members in each other's territory and faced common
issues. They included privatisation, liberalisation and new technology.
The UCW has about 180,000 members and the NCU about 130,000.
Mr Young said that if the existing executives merged, the new body would be
about 70-strong. He said both unions were looking to reduce their
executives' numbers.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Housing market shows stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE residential housing market showed signs of stabilising last month,
Nationwide Building Society said yesterday. Its house price index fell only
0.2 per cent in December.
That followed falls of 1.4 per cent in September, 2.7 per cent in October
and 2.0 per cent in November - which were interpreted as reactions to the
end of the government's stamp duty 'holiday' in August and to the
devaluation of sterling in September.
Nationwide said average house prices fell 8.4 per cent last year, from
Pounds 56,624 to Pounds 51,862.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'Transaction
levels have been low, as we would expect during the winter, but interest in
the housing market appears to be picking up.'
He said there had been a definite improvement in December compared with the
number of transactions usually recorded, but he was not prepared to say that
a recovery in the market had started unless it persisted for at least
another two months.
He added: 'We expect to see an increase in transaction levels during the
year, resulting in a stabilisation of prices in the first half of 1993.'
The Council of Mortgage Lenders was similarly cautious. It said: 'This seems
to imply that the market is relatively stable. But it is an indication that
the market is bumping along the bottom. Hopefully it could mean that there
will be an increase in transactions, but it is hard to draw any definite
conclusions from one month's figures.'
Halifax Building Society, which is not forecasting a rise in house prices,
concurred with that guarded reaction.

syndicates were left open last year - when Lloyd's declared overall losses

Mr Trevor Bradley, chairman of the Knightstone agency, is expected to meet
the members' agents who channelled Names into syndicate 475 today. He told
475 Names shortly before Christmas that their losses would be more than 200
per cent.
Both syndicates 475 and 1035, whose affairs are now being managed by the
Octavian Group, have ceased to trade.
Only about 230 syndicates are expected to underwrite at Lloyd's in 1993, a
reduction of nearly 50 per cent since 1990.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Number of new houses built last year fell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of new houses built last year fell to an 11-year low of 126,000,
the National House-Building Council of Britain said yesterday, Andrew Baxter
writes.
Its figures are for private housing starts and represent a 3 per cent fall
on the 1991 figure of 130,500. Starts during the fourth quarter were 26,400,
8 per cent lower than for the same period of 1991.
The council points out that about 25,000 of the homes started last year were
being built for housing associations, further demonstrating the depth of the
recession in the speculative housing market.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Conventions may restrict amount of
clean-up funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDS to meet the cost of cleaning up the oil spill from the Braer, and for
compensating Shetland islanders, are likely to be limited to Dollars 83m
(Pounds 54.60m) under two international conventions to which the UK is a
signatory.
Mr Jean Gaulin, chief executive of Ultramar, the north American oil company
that chartered the tanker, said insurance cover up to a maximum of Dollars
700m was available.
In order to win awards of more than Dollars 83m, claimants will need to
prove gross negligence - breaching the terms of the conventions limiting the
owners' liability.
Civil liability for oil pollution damage is governed by a 1969 international
convention and another in 1971 which set up a compensation fund.
Under the first convention, tanker owners are strictly liable for oil
pollution limited to 133 special drawing rights per tonne of oil carried, up
to a maximum of 14m SDRs.
Shipping lawyers said yesterday that in the Braer's case the liability of
the owners would be just over Dollars 8m, much less than the estimate of
Dollars 17m offered by marine insurers on Tuesday.
Skuld, the Norwegian protection and indemnity club that covers the Braer's
liability risks, would pay the first Dollars 2m, with the international
group of P&amp;I clubs paying the remainder through a mutual reinsurance
arrangement.
That would leave just over Dollars 74m to come out of the London-based
international fund for compensation to meet the remaining costs of the
clean-up and any claims for damages. The fund was set up by the oil industry
to supplement compensation available under the the 1969 convention up to a
maximum of 60m SDRs (Dollars 80m). It is financed by levies on oil
companies.
Yesterday Mr Mans Jacobsson, executive director of the compensation fund,
said he believed the fund would be sufficient to cover all claims.
Insurance cover for pollution clean-up and some other related pollution
costs is carried over and above the convention limits. The international
group of P&amp;I clubs has a reinsurance policy placed mainly with Lloyd's
syndicates and London market companies by Miller Insurance Group, the
brokers.
The policy provides cover up to Dollars 500m, with an additional policy
taking cover up to a limit of Dollars 700m.
For claimants to tap that extra source of funds, they would have to show
that the owners were directly to blame for the spillage or that they had
some knowledge of a defect in the tanker that was likely to result in
pollution.
Lawyers likened that to wilful misconduct by the owners and said it was
extremely difficult to establish.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Second disaster found Spanish port
prepared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AT SPAIN'S north-western port of La Coruna, tankers have twice in the past
16 years been impaled on the harbour's outlying rocks. But by the second
time, when the tanker Aegean Sea ran aground just over a month ago, damage
containment had demonstrably improved.
When the Urquiola created a spillage of some 100,000 tonnes in May 1976, La
Coruna's fishing community heaved oil out of the sea in buckets.
When the Aegean Sea, with a cargo of 570,000 barrels of crude, broke up at
the entrance of the port in thick fog on December 3, within hours 17
platforms were in position to start suctioning the oil.
The Urquiola spillage taught the authorities, for example, not to use
detergents. In 1976 they were used in La Coruna's estuary and all but killed
off the local mollusc industry. Some 15,000 kilos of clams used to be
collected every day, but the total since has rarely exceeded 2,000 kilos.
With the Aegean Sea's spillage, booms were on standby in addition to the
platforms and a series of container lorries equipped with suction apparatus
that were stationed on the shore. Booms, totalling 6km in all, were thrown
across the entrance to the estuary and across those of its adjoining fjords.
The booms broke because of the heavy swell - La Coruna's coastline has
barely 86 days a year of calm seas - but storms there last month helped to
disperse the slick.
The Aegean Sea was carrying, like the Braer, light crude that evaporates
more easily than heavy crude. Unlike the Shetland Islands tragedy, a fire,
which the authorities refrained from putting out, followed the shipwreck.
In all, between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of crude out of the Aegean Sea's
79,341-tonne load spilt out to sea. Some 6,500 tonnes were pumped out
directly from the stricken tanker and about 5,000 were suctioned from the
platforms and the shore. More than half the total load burnt itself out.
At the end of last week, with the pumping procedures virtually completed,
work began to clean up the beaches. Learning from the earlier disaster, the
authorities have opted to do the cleaning manually as far as possible, with
workers painstakingly scraping the crude-drenched sand with shovels rather
than using earth-moving equipment, which risks burying the oil more deeply
into the ground.
The rocks will also be scraped. High-pressure hoses employed after the
Urquiola spill were later found to have to have created unnecessary damage
to micro-organisms.
The effects of the Aegean Sea disaster on the surrounding fishing grounds
will take a long time to assess. The slick has already broken up into tiny
particles that are suspended on the surface but will eventually drop to the
ocean floor, where they will stifle plants and crustaceans alike. From the
beginning of this month, the local fishing fleets were authorised to return
to their traditional areas.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Shipping bodies say oil spills
inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIPPING organisations countered calls from environmentalists yesterday for
tougher regulations in the wake of the Braer disaster by pointing to the
virtual inevitability of oil spills so long as tanker trade continues.
Mr Chris Horrocks, secretary general of the International Chamber of
Shipping, said: 'It is a trade-off between how much the world wants oil and
the amount of environmental pollution it can put up with.'
The wreck of the Braer in the Shetland Islands, coming so soon after
December's oil spill off north-west Spain, is focusing attention on tanker
safety. But until the Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska in 1989, the amount
of oil spilled at sea had been steadily declining for almost a decade.
Much can be done to minimise the risk of oil spills and contain disasters
when they happen. The European parliament has called on European countries
to take unilateral action similar to that taken by the US after the Exxon
Valdez spill.
US legislation has concentrated on the introduction of double-hulled tankers
and the phasing out of older oil carriers with a single-skinned hull over
the next 15 years. But since about 80 per cent of oil spills are caused by
human error, there is an urgent need for harmonising training procedures
throughout the seafaring world.
Although tanker crew members must have internationally recognised
certificates of training, it is notoriously difficult to achieve sufficient
uniformity in institutions that award them. Training certificates can also
be bought and sold in the back streets of Hong Kong.
The Philippines provides the greatest number of the world's seafarers, with
India a close second. Although very high standards are achieved at some
colleges in those countries, there is a wide disparity, according to Mr
Horrocks, who is also director of the International Shipping Federation.
'There are indications that overall world training standards have
diminished,' he said.
Mr Horrocks' organisation is working to improve them by, for example,
helping the Indian authorities to find a way to pay instructors more in an
attempt to overcome the dearth of teachers in the sub-continent.
Legislation has been introduced to improve the safety of tankers themselves.
Even so, the world fleet of about 4,400 oil tankers is ageing fast and the
industry is severely underfunded.
The cost of a new tanker with the most up-to-date pollution control measures
is about Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.2m). In order to make a worthwhile return,
tanker owners need to make Dollars 60,000 a day on charter rates. Rates have
dropped this year to Dollars 15,000 a day.
Mr Kristian Fuglesang, head of Intertanko, the International Association of
Independent Tanker Owners in Norway, said: 'We feel charterers should be
prepared to pay for good-quality tonnage and shouldn't charter sub-standard
ships. That's the only way the world fleet will be renewed.'
Yet oil companies, which are short of cash because oil prices remain low,
are taking advantage of overcapacity in the tanker industry to strike very
hard bargains on freight rates.
Mr Fuglesang said that in 1991 the freight cost represented just 1 per cent
of the final price of petrol at the pump in the US and 3 per cent in
Germany.
Although freight rates have fallen, it is still more lucrative to run
tankers than to scrap them. The rate of scrapping old tankers - most of
which were built at the peak of the oil price boom in the mid 1970s - rose
last year, but at the same rate it would still take 200 years to scrap the
entire world fleet.
The International Maritime Organisation will require tankers more than 25
years old to be brought up to the standard of newly built vessels after
1995.
However, the RMT maritime union called on the government yesterday to ban
all bulk carriers and tankers that are more than 15 years old from entering
British waters unless they met UK safety standards.
That highlights the need to tighten the random inspection procedures of
vessels calling at UK ports. There have been calls for increases in
resources to step up the inspection regime.
The government appears to be moving towards extending the inquiry of the
Braer disaster to include tanker safety as a whole.
The Merchant Navy Officers' Union has criticised the use of flags of
convenience such as Liberia (where the Braer was registered) in UK waters,
saying it has led to a fall in standards. Shipping experts say, however,
that Liberia's safety record is better than average.
Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, who called for
an improvement in safety procedures in a letter to the government 18 months
ago, called on the government yesterday to designate a mandatory exclusion
zone around the Shetland Islands, giving coastguards the power to levy fines
on vessels that infringe it.
Mr Wallace also wants the introduction of transponders, a radio device
fitted to ships and aircraft that responds to a radar wave so that vessels
can be identified when in trouble as well as tracked.
Meanwhile, the Meteorological Office yesterday called for changes to
maritime law to compel ships carrying hazardous cargoes to receive regular
weather forecasts.
The UK is unlikely to act outside the International Maritime Organisation,
which requires international consensus to pass regulations. That means that
changing and updating the statutes takes many years. Until countries take
concerted action, the waters of the world will grow more polluted.

<TEXT>
CRITICS of the government's response to the disaster will seize on a report
about the Department of Transport's emergency provisions for oil and
chemical spills at sea conducted two years ago by the National Audit Office,
the government spending watchdog, Ivo Dawnay writes.
The report, which may influence the inquiry into the spill, underlined that
the department had not carried out a detailed evaluation of the costs and
practicability of responding to oil pollution involving more than 10,000
tonnes.
The report said the Transport Department had raised its stockpiles of aerial
dispersant. But it added: 'They (the department) did not carry out a
detailed evaluation of the costs and benefits of different levels of
airborne response capacity. Nor was consideration given to the clean-up
costs and environmental impact of larger spills.'
The Department of Transport said last night that it was unable to give a
detailed response but stressed that the NAO had no quarrels with its
capability for spraying.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Long-term fears 'may be unfounded'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHETLAND oil spill might kill thousands of birds in the next few months
but studies of past disasters show that some environmentalists' fears about
long-term ecological damage may be unfounded, scientists said yesterday.
Mr Peter Taylor, of the Oil Pollution Research Unit, the Dyfed-based
environmental consultancy, said: 'The Exxon Valdez (which foundered in 1989
off the Alaskan coast) shows that nature is a great recoverer.'
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said last night that the
bodies of 100 oil-covered birds had been recovered so far in Shetland and
that it believed 10,000 birds could be at risk.
The Shetland Islands are one of the UK's most important breeding grounds for
seabirds and marine mammals, including nearly 800 otters, one of the largest
groups in the UK. Many of the threatened birds are at sea but will return to
nest within two months.
The islands' 12,000 black guillemots, a third of the UK total, are beginning
to arrive already.
Mr Derek Niemann of the RSPB said: 'Guillemots are very competitive for the
best space on cliff ledges and get clobbered by oil more than most other
birds because they nest low down the cliffs.'
Since the wreck of the Torrey Canyon off the south-west coast of England in
1967, much scientific effort has been devoted to assessing the environmental
impact of oil spills, although US court actions have delayed the publication
of some research.
According to Mr Taylor, studies suggest that 'the effects last three months
to 30 years, depending on the type of oil, the weather and the type of
shoreline'.
Although the light crude oil carried by the Braer evaporates more quickly
than many other types, it contains complex hydrocarbons that are toxic to
wildlife in many ways.
Mr Paul Johnston, marine toxicologist at Exeter University, said: 'It
poisons them by affecting their lung tissue if inhaled, or it is absorbed
through the stomach into the blood and overwhelms the liver. Then between
six months and two years you get more subtle effects, such as fish
populations crashing because their larvae have been poisoned,' he added.
'Between two and 10 years you start to see more long-term effects - lesions
on the bottom of flatfish or abnormal shell development in shellfish.'
US studies of polluted waters such as the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay
suggest that some chemicals in oil may be cancerous or cause genetic
changes. A few may also bioaccumulate - they may stay in the organism's
tissues without killing it, and so might be passed up the food chain, with
eventual risk to human health, although several scientists emphasised that
the tendency was many times smaller than with pesticides.
Some long-term effects might be extremely hard to detect, Mr Johnston added.
Although the wildlife numbers would eventually recover, 'you cannot
obliterate that much of a community and expect it to regenerate exactly the
same. The gene pool will be smaller, reducing the community's long-term
ability to adapt to change,' he said.
However, several scientists emphasised that long-term effects might be very
small and the environment's own resilience underestimated. Waves and
bacteria eventually break down oil and 'the conventional wisdom is that in
10 years an oil-fouled beach has cleared', Mr Johnston said. But experts are
divided on the best techniques for treating the slick - and on whether
treatment is effective at all.
Greenpeace, the campaign group, last night criticised the decision to start
spraying the Shetland slick with detergent. Mr Jeremy Leggett, Greenpeace
scientific director, said that 'spraying just transfers the oil from the
surface of the sea to the floor', with the risk of prolonging the pollution.
While Mr Taylor agreed that 'the decision whether to use (spraying) can be
complex', he added: 'I'm not against it, as it helps break up the oil into
smaller particles.'
Exxon's own report into the environmental impact on the Alaskan coastline a
year after the spillage, which concluded that 'recovery was well under way',
attributed that partly to the extensive beach cleaning operation, in which
stones were individually scrubbed.

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Engine failure still a mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIPPING industry experts were reaching a preliminary conclusion yesterday
that the Braer suffered from a combination of mechanical failures and plain
bad luck before it struck the rocks at Garths Ness.
Mr Michael Hudner, chief executive of Bergvall &amp; Hudner Ship Management,
operators of the tanker, said last night that a tug was ordered up to assist
the stricken vessel at 5.19am, two hours before the first one subsequently
set out after receiving clearance from the coastguard in the interim.
There still should have been sufficient time for the ship to have been
saved, but when the tug Star Sirius arrived, the crew had all been winched
off, leaving no one aboard to fix a tow line.
B&amp;H said the Braer's crew had been urged by a rescue helicopter to leave the
ship. The captain chose to be winched off about half an hour before the Star
Sirius arrived.
Shipping industry experts defended the captain's decision to take the tanker
through the 22-mile channel between Shetland and Fair Isle. Mr Michael Grey
of Lloyd's List said: 'The ship would have been far more exposed had it
sailed north around the island.'
Mr Grey was uncertain as to exactly how the ship could have taken water into
its fuel system so comprehensively that the engine failed and could not be
revived.
He said the severity of the Braer's trouble suggested that water had entered
the engine itself. There are precedents for such an event, although rarely
with such catastrophic consequences.
Mr Grey speculated that water might have entered through a ruptured vent to
one of the fuel tanks or at the time the fuel was taken on board.
'Fuel contamination is actually quite common, but what isn't common is that
it leads to a ship being disabled for long enough for a ship to get washed
up on the rocks,' he said.
Fuel is drawn from settling tanks sited within the main tanks. Ordinarily -
to give time for impurities to settle - one tank is drawn down while the
other is refilled. In an emergency, it would be possible to take fuel from
the other settling tank or even from one of the main bunkers, Mr Alec
Bilney, a marine adviser at the International Chamber of Shipping said.
Ships' diesel engines work like those for road vehicles in that, if the fuel
supply runs dry, their feeder systems need to be bled or evacuated before
they can be restarted.
'Don't forget they were working under extreme conditions,' Mr Bilney said.
'It was force 11, with very low manning levels that all ships have.
'They were working in this cathedral of an engine room with the whole ship
lurching violently. The fact is that they kept on struggling for two or
three hours. I have enormous respect for them.'

FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Islanders see fears fulfilled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A DISASTER like this has been on everyone's mind for the last 20 years,'
says Mr James Moncrieff, a Shetlander. 'It's ironic that it turned out to be
a passing tanker that caused it.'
The Shetland islands have had a tempestuous relationship with the oil
industry since North Sea oil was discovered in the 1970s and it was decided
to bring it ashore at Sullom Voe at the north end of the main island.
For years the Shetlanders negotiated arrangements with the oil companies
that would make them one of the more prosperous parts of Britain, and which
would guard against the destruction of their environment.
The Shetlanders were concerned not just that their gaunt scenery should be
disfigured as little as possible by the oil industry's installations. They
were also deeply worried that at some stage there would be an environmental
catastrophe involving tankers using Sullom Voe.
In the event, there has been only one serious spillage, in an accident
involving a tanker at the oil and gas terminal, which opened in 1981. That
was not on anything like the scale of the Braer disaster, but because of the
constant awareness of the threat of an environmental tragedy, Shetland,
which has a population of 22,000, has always been prepared and well equipped
to deal with oil pollution.
As disaster has been a lingering nightmare, many people in Shetland have
reacted with resignation to the fact that it has now struck, albeit from an
unexpected quarter. But there has also been anger that the Braer was
travelling close to the islands and questions have been raised about the
standards of seamanship of the tanker's crew.
That surfaced at a press conference yesterday morning when Mr Willie Tait,
the Shetland Islands councillor for the Sumburgh area, blamed the crew of
the Braer for the disaster and said that a British crew would not have
abandoned its ship while it was in such danger of crashing with devastating
effect on to the rocks.
While many Shetlanders are dismayed by the threat to the birds and sealife
caused by the pollution, and by the casualties they have already suffered,
the biggest economic threat is to the fishing and fish farming industries.
In spite of oil wealth, Shetland still makes much of its living from fish.
Almost a third of the islands' 10,000-strong labour force works in the fish
industry, including fishermen, fish processors and salmon farmers.
Mr John Goodlad, secretary of the Shetland Fishermen's Association, said:
'We are more dependent on fish than any other part of the EC. Without
fishing, the future of this community is doubtful.'
Fortunately, with the oil slick so far confined to a fairly small area
around the wreck of the Braer, there has been no impact on the fishing
grounds and the islands' salmon farms have not been affected.
Salmon farming became an important industry in Shetland in the 1980s and
Shetland produces about a quarter of the 40,000 tonnes of salmon reared by
salmon farms in Scotland.
The Shetland salmon farming industry is reckoned to account for about Pounds
35m of the Pounds 80m turnover of the islands' fishing industry.
Mr Moncrieff, who is chief executive of the Shetland Salmon Farmers'
Association, said: 'We are very afraid of what would happen if the oil slick
entered the voes (inlets) on the west coast where most of the salmon farms
are.'
The cages in which the salmon are reared would be highly vulnerable to oil
pollution. The nearest voe containing fish farms is at East Burra, only 13
miles from the scene of the disaster.
The salmon farmers hope the emergency teams will erect booms to prevent the
oil entering the voes, but until it is clear where the oil will go there is
little to be done than prepare the booms. Two small booms have been erected
near the wreck so far.
About 1,500 metres of boom material is on the islands and a further 5,000 to
7,000 metres is arriving early today by ferry from Aberdeen, having been
rushed from England.
A more immediate worry for the fishermen and fish farmers is the chemical
dispersants that are being sprayed on the oil at and around the wrecked
tanker.
Mr Moncrieff said: 'The mixture of oil and dispersant creates an emulsion
which goes right down through the water, whereas without dispersant the oil
stays on the surface. This means that with the dispersant the oil may cause
more damage than if it had been left.'
Both he and Mr Goodlad believe that with Shetland being at the confluence of
the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, the best action to take where the oil
slick is outside confined waters is to leave the forces of nature to
disperse the oil.

on wide-ranging tariff cuts as part of a last effort to make headway in the
Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation before President Bush
leaves office on January 20, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor.
The commitment to focus on a market access settlement follows a confidential
weekend meeting outside London between Mrs Carla Hills, outgoing US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, who has just taken over responsibility
in the EC for negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The meeting was intended to define what was achievable between now and
January 20. It is understood that the Clinton administration will dedicate
its first 100 days to domestic economic reforms, possibly leaving Uruguay
Round negotiations to languish for several months.
While the EC will seek more sectors in which tariffs can be cut to zero, the
US has agreed to examine the reduction of a number of high tariffs. The most
controversial of these would be in the textiles sector. Sir Leon Brittan
said in Brussels yesterday that a deal by mid-January was 'a formidable
challenge for the Commission but not an impossible one.'

FT  07 JAN 93 / Brown wants to lead US trade policy

<TEXT>
MR Ron Brown, the commerce secretary-nominee for the Clinton administration,
yesterday moved quickly to assert his predominance over US trade policy and
promised to become 'a forceful advocate' for US technology and economic
development.
The man who, as chairman of the Democratic party, paved the way for the
election of a Democratic president, went on to demonstrate mastery of the
many trade and industrial issues.
Mr Brown is the first Clinton nominee to come up for confirmation hearings.
He said that his department would be 'the lead agency on trade policy,' by
implication defining the role of Mr Mickey Kantor, the nominee for US trade
representative, as the official who simply 'negotiates agreements'.
Unlike his Republican predecessors, Mr Brown clearly will not allow
ideological restraints to enfeeble him.
The department will fund 'targeted, innovative programmes' to spur
technology development, and he hopes to play 'a large role' in defence
conversion.
'The question before us is how best to design trade, technology and
development policies, not theoretical arguments about whether we ought to
have those policies,' he said. 'Action, not ideology, will be my watchword.'
He had tough words for trade law enforcement. 'I think we have to stop
getting rolled.'
In another departure from the Republican administration, he promised to back
barter 'as a vehicle for improving our ability to trade,' particularly with
Russia and other countries which have little hard currency.
More like his predecessors, he talked about a private-sector-led partnership
between industry and government, but he seemed to have the will and the
wiles to achieve this goal.
Mr Brown smoothly confronted questions about his career as a Washington
lobbyist, when his clients included American subsidiaries of Japanese
electronics companies and the government of Haiti.
Senator Trent Lott, the member designated by Republicans to make Democratic
nominees uncomfortable, asked Mr Brown if his work for 'special interests'
and his insider status did not 'perhaps send the wrong message as we begin
with this. . . administration?'
'I think it sends the right message,' Mr Brown shot back. 'I think it sends
the message that I'm someone who is a good advocate and gets things done.'

FT  07 JAN 93 / US film makers focus on Uruguay Round: The audio-visual
trade tussle has come to a head in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US film and television industries have long cast a covetous eye on
Europe's Dollars 30bn audio-visual market. For as long, Europe's governments
have fought a largely unsuccessful battle to protect local culture from US
'polluting' influences.
The tussle has come to a head in Geneva in the Uruguay Round negotiations on
world trade reform, where the US has put European concessions in
audio-visual services at the top of its EC negotiating agenda.
In Geneva the EC has called for the US formally to concede that audio-visual
services 'is not an industry quite like any other'. One official said: 'We
want some sort of recognition from the US that the sector needs to be
considered in more than just economic terms.' With a concession of this kind
on the table, he said, the EC could then start to talk market access
numbers. 'The overwhelming problem is that in the US, audio-visual services
are seen in purely commercial terms,' the official complained: 'In the EC,
the economic aspect is seen as much less important, and it is seen in
cultural and political terms.'
The US has good reasons for seeing the sector as it does: 'Audio-visual
services are our second-largest export, and while we are certainly sensitive
to cultural issues around the world, the facts are that they are a very
significant commercial undertaking for the US economy,' a US official said.
The US film and television industry has a turnover of about Dollars 40bn a
year - more than the industry of the EC member states combined, and about 40
per cent of the total world industry. Exports in 1990 to the EC amounted to
almost Dollars 3.8bn. After imports from the EC of about Dollars 250m, this
gave the US a surplus in trade in films, videos and television programmes of
more than Dollars 3.5bn.
'This is an enormous commercial market, notwithstanding any cultural
desirabilities,' the US official said. It is also a market that is highly
fragmented for both cultural and language reasons - making EC companies
minnows when compared to US giants such as Universal or Time Warner, and
making the markets comparatively easy prey to well-organised foreign
competition.
As with so many disputes within the Uruguay Round, this is essentially one
between the US and the EC. Japan supports the US since its own manufacturers
acquired some of America's biggest film-makers. But smaller players such as
Australia and India share EC concerns that their own film industries might
be hurt if US companies win unfettered access to their markets.
The most critical US target is the television industry, since US film makers
already account for 70 per cent of cinema box-office receipts across Europe.
Just 20 per cent of films are made locally.
US film makers would ideally like the EC audio-visual market to be wholly
open. In practice, negotiators aim to persuade the EC to open a minimum
share of the market to foreign companies, and to promise never again to
reduce that share. 'One problem is that they have no offer on the table at
all at present,' a US official said.
A problem for EC negotiators is that the Commission has no clear mandate
under the Treaty of Rome to negotiate trade in services on behalf of member
states. In France, the most fiercely independent and culturally sensitive EC
market, 60 per cent of all television programming is reserved for French
companies - with the exception of film channels such as Canal Plus. Forty
per cent must be in the French language. Other member states set a minimum
level of 50 per cent local content. In Germany, responsibility for cultural
policies rests with regional governments, making it tricky for the federal
government to be seen setting policy.
Another EC problem is the fragility of the domestic industries. Deregulation
and a proliferation of new television channels has led to increased US
programme content at a time when the total of programme hours has grown
tenfold.
The US giants have gained because of superior distribution across the EC
region, better marketing, and because they have been able to win marginal
sales in the EC at low prices that can be underpinned by sound profits
already earned in the large and vibrant domestic market.
This success by US film and television companies, coupled with the immense
and growing US trade surplus in the sector, make US complaints over EC trade
barriers ring hollow.
Another EC problem is the Broadcast Directive, which is due for review in
October next year, and which sets the framework for cross-border television
services throughout the EC. Brussels insists that the EC cannot have its
hands tied before the review.
In spite of these problems, it would seem possible that the EC could
compromise by offering foreign companies at least as much of the EC market
as they currently have. With the audio-visual market growing by almost 11
per cent a year across the EC, this binding alone would ensure steady export
growth for US producing companies.

THE Indian government is investigating whether funds moved out of the
country by Standard Chartered, the British bank, were being used to finance
terrorist activity, the parliamentary committee probing the Bombay
securities scandal was told yesterday.
Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, a Congress MP and chairman of the committee, said last
night that the Home Ministry's enforcement directorate was probing six
transactions in recent months totalling Rs40.1m (Pounds 899,000) - made
through accounts used for the remittance of money abroad, in violation of
foreign exchange regulations.
In London, Standard Chartered said it was aware of the speculation about
transfers from its Indian operations and that its internal investigation
into the Bombay scandal was looking into this. However, no evidence of
transfers to fund terrorist activities had yet been uncovered. Mr Mirdha
said foreign exchange had been remitted by Standard Chartered against rupee
cheques, violating Reserve Bank guidelines. The investigators had estimated
the exposure of the securities scandal at Rs53.41bn, up Rs7.64bn from the
assessment in October by the Reserve Bank of India.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Social Democratic party, Japan's largest opposition party, yesterday
chose Mr Sadao Yamahana as its new chairman, prompting criticism from the
party's younger members who think him incapable of introducing much-needed
reforms.
Mr Yamahana, 56, vowed to change 'my party and the political system', but
similar promises were made by his ineffective predecessor, Mr Makoto Tanabe,
who resigned after criticism that he did not attack the failings of the
ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Younger party members had hoped for a more radical appointment, and some
left-wing officials had wanted Ms Takako Doi to return to the post she
vacated for Mr Tanabe after admitting that she, too, had failed to make the
party a genuine alternative to the LDP.
The SDPJ, formerly the Japan Socialist party, has been unable to capitalise
on the scandals afflicting the LDP, even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, has a popularity rating of only 14 per cent.
Mr Yamahana is said to be from the party's 'soft left' and agrees with plans
to reform unpopular policies, such as denying the existence of the defence
forces and supporting the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung. He is also in
favour of developing a coherent economic policy in the hope of reassuring
voters that the party could lead the country out of recession.
However, for the past year Mr Yamahana has been secretary general, the
party's number two post, and there was little sign that he was spearheading
a reform programme deferred for more than a decade.
On hearing of Mr Yama-hana's elevation, Mr Miyazawa noted his opponent's
oratorical skills and suggested that he had taken on a heavy responsibility.
Other opposition party leaders said the new chairman must work with them
against the LDP.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Israel arrests 22 Hamas militants

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL, tightening its crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists in the occupied
territories, said yesterday it had arrested 22 members of an armed guerrilla
group and warned that a United Nations envoy due in Jerusalem today would
not achieve the return of 415 Palestinians expelled to Lebanon last month.
The army said the detained suspects belonged to the Qassam military wing of
the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and were responsible for at least
three attacks last year on troops in the town of Hebron in which one soldier
was killed. It said two more members of the group had been among those
expelled and presented the arrests as a significant breakthrough against
Qassam, whose mounting record of armed attacks on the security forces
precipitated the expulsions on December 17.
But the army admitted it had not yet caught those responsible for six fatal
shootings in December - including the man it described as the commander of
Qassam.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, meanwhile held out little prospect of
success for Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, a senior envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary general, who will today attempt to find a resolution to
the expulsion issue which threatens Middle East peace negotiations.
'Boutros Ghali asked to send an envoy. I agreed. It does not change even one
bit my decisive position that the 415 temporarily expelled will not return
to Israel before the end of their term,' Mr Rabin said.
Mr Rabin's office said yesterday that no talks had been held outside the
Washington Middle East peace framework, after the Jerusalem Post reported
that Israel and Syria had held secret talks in Europe within the past two
weeks, but that an Israeli attempt to find a breakthrough in negotiations
over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had come to nothing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday accused the European
Community of trade discrimination in a sharp attack on Brussels that stood
in stark contrast to the friendly tone which characterised relations after
he came to power last July.
Speaking at a conference in Tel Aviv on high-tech industry, Mr Rabin
bitterly criticised the imbalance in Israel-EC trade in which Israeli
exports to the Community in 1991 were worth only half of the Dollars 9bn
(Pounds 5.8bn) imported from EC members.
'(This was) not because Israel cannot compete in the European markets but
because in Europe there is high talk of a free economy, of a free market
economy, but when it comes to Israel there is discrimination,' Mr Rabin
said.
The EC welcomed the advent of Mr Rabin's Labour-led government. It rewarded
Labour's pledge to abandon the former Likud administration's uncompromising
stance in Middle East peace talks by agreeing to speed talks on enhancing
Israel's 1975 co-operation accord with the EC to possible inclusion in the
European Economic Area.
But Mr Rabin appeared to have been angered by EC reaction to the expulsion
last month of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, including a delay of further
talks on a new agreement. He said the 1975 accord was 'old and distorted'
and 'does not give us conditions of equal competition with East Europe and
North Africa.'
'It is time for Europe to change this because Israel too has the possibility
to buy elsewhere,' he added.
Reverting to traditional Labour positions, he said he was 'shocked' that
government agencies and companies often purchased from foreign suppliers for
the sake of 'two or three per cent' savings and supported moves to exclude
from government tenders foreign vehicle suppliers - mainly Japanese - which
refuse to enter counter-purchase deals to buy Israeli goods.

AUSTRALIAN trade unions yesterday forecast an industrial battle in Victoria
after the conservative state government announced plans to make 8,500
transport workers redundant over the next three years, writes Kevin Brown in
Sydney.
Mr Alan Brown, the Victorian transport minister, said the redundancies were
essential to reduce losses of more than ADollars 2bn (Pounds 900m) a year in
'Australia's worst performing government-owned business enterprise'.
Mr Brown said the shake-up would also include cuts in night-time transport,
replacement of many tram and train services with buses, and widespread use
of private contractors. The government claimed the proposals would save
taxpayers ADollars 250m a year.
The Victorian trades council, which groups most trade unions in the state,
said it would fight to maintain services and jobs.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Prosperity, as much as peace, eludes Cambodia: Attempts to
manage the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS IF they did not have enough on their hands, United Nations peacekeepers
in Cambodia have begun the thankless task of supervising the country's
shattered economy.
Among the first economic measures taken by the UN Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac) are moves to control the national budget deficit and to
reduce government corruption.
Cambodia faces accelerating inflation - consumer prices in Phnom Penh rose
284 per cent between January and November 1992, according to Untac figures -
and the country has experienced such a rapid decline in the value of the
riel, the local currency, that many prices are quoted in dollars.
Although some of the inflation has been blamed on Untac's own heavy demand
for services in the capital, the principal problem is that the
Vietnamese-installed government has been printing money to plug its budget
deficit.
This view was endorsed on Monday in a report from the UN's economic
directorate, which said Untac money has had a largely positive impact on
economic growth.
Even with public investment and maintenance spending cut back to what the
World Bank calls 'negligible levels' (roads, hospitals, power supplies and
telecommunications are in a parlous state) more than 45 per cent of
government spending budgeted for 1992 was unfunded.
Deprived of Soviet aid since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and reduced
to the status of one of the four Cambodian factions by the peace accords
signed in Paris a year ago, the lame duck administration of Mr Hun Sen, the
prime minister, has been struggling to pay soldiers, teachers and doctors.
Often it pays them late. Government officials, meanwhile, have enriched
themselves by selling state property to speculators and pocketing the
proceeds.
Untac, aware that spending can hardly be cut further, has prodded the
administration into increasing its revenues. A 10 per cent tax was imposed
on hotel room charges in October, and customs tariffs, which have lagged
behind inflation, are being brought into line with the real market value of
imports.
Corruption is also being targeted by UN officials sent to monitor various
ministries, the central bank and local authorities. 'Now that we are inside
and looking at the finances very closely we see a lot of corruption cases,
involving tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands in some
cases,' says one UN official. Some government officials have been fired.
Corruption and prostitution in Phnom Penh have given rise to a widely-held
theory that destitute, resentful peasants in the countryside will feel so
outraged by the goings-on in the capital that they will start to support the
puritanical Khmer Rouge, despite its reputation for having killed a million
Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1978.
The reality is more complicated. Most of the inhabitants of Phnom Penh are
themselves first-generation city dwellers rather than urban sophisticates.
And Cambodian peasants - like peasants throughout the developing world - are
more likely to want to join the migration to urban areas than to despise the
cities from afar.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that economic revival is not confined to Phnom
Penh. Throughout the country, people can be seen repairing their houses and
Buddhist temples. Meat and rice and imported beer seem plentiful. There is
even a video rental shop in the central town of Kompong Thom, in a province
hotly contested by the government and the Khmer Rouge.
It is true that most investment by foreign companies and Cambodians of
ethnic Chinese origin has been in service industries such as hotels, mobile
telephones and banking rather than industry, but that is neither surprising
nor necessarily undesirable in a country with such a potential for tourism.
There are small industrial investments from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia
and elsewhere, including a textile factory, a bakery, the renovation of the
brewery in Sihanoukville, now producing Cambodian beer, and the
rehabilitation of a tobacco processing factory.
Returning Cambodians, says one banker in Phnom Penh, 'are voting with their
cash in as much as they are renovating properties, buying properties and
starting small businesses'.
Cambodia's economic prospects have also been boosted by the sympathetic
attentions of the World Bank (which is planning a Dollars 75m emergency
rehabilitation loan), the International Monetary Fund (donors are likely to
arrange payment of Dollars 50m in Cambodian arrears to the IMF to allow
renewed IMF programmes in the country) and the Asian Development Bank (which
is to disburse a Dollars 68m loan for rehabilitation).
But neither World Bank programmes nor higher customs tariffs can provide
what Cambodians really need if they are to enjoy sustained economic growth:
peace.
So far, with the Khmer Rouge refusing to disarm or take part in the election
scheduled for May, the UN is not succeeding in its principal task of
bringing peace and democracy to Cambodia. Until it does, economic progress
and the confidence of investors will be undermined by exceptionally high
political risk.

FT  07 JAN 93 / West targets Russia's tobacco plants
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DONSKOI Tabak, the Russian cigarette plant at Rostov, is being wooed by the
west's tobacco multinationals.
The Interfax news agency reported earlier this week that BAT will 'take part
in a competition for the right to buy shares' in the plant, probably later
this month.
Interfax quotes Donskoi Tabak's general director, Mr Yevgeny Balala, as
saying that 'several Swiss and American companies' have now expressed
interest in the 4.5m cigarette-a-day plant.
BAT would not confirm the story, but did confirm that the three tobacco
majors - BAT, RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris - are 'head to head in
investment terms' in the former Soviet Union.
It is a potential bonanza: a market estimated at between 400 - 700bn
cigarettes a year and an unsatisfied craving for American tobacco has meant
that they, even more avidly than the energy companies and with greater
success so far, are scrambling to position themselves for future market
growth.
Furthermore, the Russian government's move to large-scale privatisation at
the end of last year - expected to be greatly extended later this month -
means that the foreign companies have a new way of buying in, other than
concluding joint ventures.
They can now bid for shares in the company at open auctions in competition
with Russians - a method which, according to Interfax, BAT has already
discussed with the Donskoi management at meetings last month.
Of the three, Philip Morris, with its Marlboro brand, is the best known. It
came in on the ground floor in Russia in 1990 (it had small production
agreements before) with the request by the then Soviet government to import
20bn cigarettes immediately to satisfy a cigarette famine which caused more
riots in that year than any other event.
Philip Morris had built on that entree and now has firm projects which
include a stake in a joint venture called Constellation in Samara involving
the city's main tobacco factory, where Marlboro will be produced under
licence.
It also has a prospective stake in the cigarette plant in Krasnodar, which
is about to be privatised.
This has a capacity of 6bn cigarettes a year and will produce Marlboro and
other Philip Morris and local brands; and an agreement to construct a
10bn-cigarettes-a-year capacity plant near St Petersburg, also for Marlboro.
The company says it has no overall figure for investment, but says that the
cost of the St Petersburg plant in the west would be around Dollars 100m
(Pounds 64.7m). 'We are in for the long term,' says Philip Morris's Michael
Parsons, 'and the investment will be significant'.
BAT has been the later runner of the big three: but towards the end of last
year, it signed a joint venture in Ukraine, with two plants at Priluki and
Cherkassy, both south of Kiev, and is in an advanced stage of negotiations
with the Java plant in Moscow. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said in
Moscow in November that 'the investments we are making are essentially long
term. . . we do not expect to be making profits for at least 10 years.'
RJ Reynolds, part of RJR Nabisco, last year acquired a controlling stake in
the largest cigarette plant in St Petersburg, AS Petro - now renamed
RJR-Petro.
The plant produces some 22bn cigarettes year - all local brands - the RJR
brand leader, Camel, nor any of its other brands, is not produced - allowing
it to claim the biggest output of the big three in Russia.
It also claims to dominate Ukraine, with majority stakes in plants in Lvov
and Kremenchug, with a combined capacity of around 20bn cigarettes a year -
again, all local brands.
This gives RJR around 25 per cent of the Ukraine cigarette market.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Turkey moves closer to EC on tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has moved a step closer to full customs union with the European
Community by announcing a substantial tariff preference for its European
trade partners under a new import regime published this week.
EC officials said the new two-tier tariff system, which took effect from
January 1, provides both the Community and countries of the European Free
Trade Association with real trade preference for the first time.
The reform, which has taken three years to prepare, ends a number of
non-tariff barriers and reduces effective protection rates for Turkish
industry.
The Community accounts for 43 per cent of Turkey's imports, worth around
Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn) in 1991, and 50 per cent of the country's exports.
Under customs union, by January 1996 Turkey is set to remove all trade
barriers to EC goods and adopt the Community's common external tariff for
third countries.
In line with a 1963 Association Agreement with the Community, Ankara
announced a further 10 per cent cut in the legal duty, on the so-called
10-year list and the more sensitive industrial items included in the 22-year
list.
The Turks have also gone some way to reduce non-tariff barriers to trade,
which in practice kept Turkish levels of protection high and were a
principal bone of contention in trade talks with Brussels in the past.
Of these, special levies such as the municipality tax and stamp duty are
scrapped.
In a further concession, Turkey announced tariff cuts in agriculture and
iron and steel products, which were not previously included in the
negotiations.
There remains some concern over the retention of the Mass Housing Fund, a
non-tariff barrier which in some instances has been increased and even
extended to products previously exempt, all in an apparent effort to make up
for the revenue shortfall implicit in the changes.

MR Charles Keating, one of the best-known figures in the US savings and loan
crisis, was found guilty yesterday on 73 counts of racketeering and fraud,
Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
The charges against Mr Keating and his son, Charles, who was found guilty on
64 similar counts, stemmed from the collapse of American Continental Corp
and its subsidiary, Lincoln Savings and Loan.
Sentencing was set for March 15. Mr Keating senior is already serving a
10-year state sentence for bilking investors out of Dollars 268m (Pounds
176.3m).

FT  07 JAN 93 / How to lead the world without becoming its policeman: The US
dilemma in a new world order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL of the Berlin Wall may have ushered in a 'new world order', but the
international community has not yet worked out how to meet its challenges.
For the US these are principally to do with when and how the world's only
remaining superpower should use its military might around the world.
Academics, diplomats and lawyers have been preoccupied by the issue since
the end of the cold war removed some of the certainties from international
relationships.
With US troops now patrolling Mogadishu, and with the suffering people of
Sarajevo on US television screens every day, it is an issue that is also
engaging public opinion.
President George Bush will have disappointed those who were looking to his
farewell speech at the West Point military academy on Tuesday for a cogent
articulation of his 'new world order'. Arguing that the US must be the
world's leader, but not its policeman, he said the relative importance of
America's interests could not determine when military force should be used,
and warned that there could be no easy formula for making this
determination.
'Anyone looking for scientific certitude is in for disappointment. In the
complex new world we are entering, there can be no single or simple set of
fixed rules for using force.'
General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agrees. 'Having
a fixed set of rules for how you will go to war is like saying you are
always going to use the elevator in the event of fire in your apartment
building,' he wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Few, in fact, argue for such a set of conditions to be rigorously met before
US military forces should be engaged - although some right-wing
intellectuals, such as Mr Andrew Cowin of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think-tank, warn ferociously against letting the United Nations
lure the US into 'military entanglements where Americans have no interests
at stake'.
Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary under President Ronald Reagan, spelt
out in 1984 a set of six tests for the use of military force:
The occasion must be vital to US interests.
There must be a 'clear intention of winning'.
Political and military objectives must be clearly defined.
The operation must be continually reassessed and adjusted.
Popular and congressional support must be assured.
Force must be a last resort.
But Mr Weinberger himself says he never used the tests as an inflexible
checklist. 'I didn't start with a pad of paper and check them off one after
another, but I certainly referred to them,' he says.
Today, when conflicts inviting possible US intervention are likely to be
regional in nature or even intra-state, the decision may be more blurred.
The decades-long struggle against the Soviet Union provided the US with an
invitation to virtually any conflict around the world, because of its
interest in combating communism wherever it arose; but it also provided a
curb, because of the threat that any local conflict could escalate into a
more global war.
Neither Somalia nor Bosnia, however, would pass all of Mr Weinberger's tests
without argument, although he favours intervention in both cases, and argues
for a general US interest in making it clear that aggression will not go
unpunished.
Nor does either case, or the protective zone established in Iraqi Kurdistan,
fit easily into the framework of international legal opinion  - principally
based on the UN charter - whose balance between the competing claims of
national sovereignty and human suffering has been gradually shifting.
Mr Richard Gardner, formerly a senior US diplomat and now professor of
international law at Columbia Law School in New York, notes that few
international lawyers would assert a unilateral right to intervene
militarily in another country to correct human rights abuses.
'The Security Council is more likely than it was before to deal with mass
repression when it can reasonably find a threat to 'international peace and
security'. . . .What the members of the Security Council will not do is
authorise military intervention in a country on human rights grounds alone,'
he writes in a recent paper for the Institute for Strategic Studies.
China, but also India and some African and Latin American countries - and,
for that matter, the UK - are particularly sensitive about setting
precedents for outside interference in their domestic affairs on human
rights grounds.
Some lawyers and diplomats, however, are looking for a framework that would
authorise swifter and more pre-emptive action.
Even where the political will and legal justification for intervention
exist, US military leaders, with the lessons of the Vietnam war reinforced
in their minds by the bombing of the US Marines barracks in Beirut, remain
chary of commiting their troops in any conflict where they cannot be assured
of a quick and crushing victory - as they were in the Gulf war.
The Pentagon's doubts about the wisdom of committing ground troops to Bosnia
have been shared by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of state. 'It's again
what got us into Vietnam. You do a little bit and it doesn't work . . . what
do you do next?' he said last year.
But Mr Les Aspin, chairman of the House of Representatives armed services
committee and Mr Clinton's nominee to be secretary of defence, argues that
the balance has tilted against this 'all or nothing' school.
This shift has come, he says, because the collapse of the Soviet Union has
'removed some of the pressure for escalation that accompanies any limited
military venture', but also because technological advances have made
possible effective air strikes with little loss of life either on the US
side or among the enemy's civilian population.
But Gen Powell says that 'when the 'surgery' is over and the desired result
is not obtained, a new set of experts then comes forward with talk of just a
little escalation'.
Military officers also warn that without forces on the ground to verify
strikes you run the risk that a bombed weapons factory can be transformed
into a children's hospital before the first television camera has arrived.
But the Pentagon has been hoist by its own petard: after letting the public
believe during Operation Desert Storm that they could drop a smart bomb down
a chimney pipe or make a cruise missile turn right at the traffic lights,
the generals are not believed when they say they cannot be sure to hit a
mortar battery on a Bosnian hillside.
Mr Aspin cautions that, with the decline of the Soviet threat, US public
opinion may not tolerate paying Dollars 250bn or even Dollars 200bn a year
for a military that is not very useful.
'It may be that to maintain a military for the extreme contingencies, it
will be necessary to show that it is useful in lesser contingencies,' he
says.
But US public opinion will also depend on the success or failure of military
intervention in Somalia and, perhaps in the months to come, in Bosnia; if
either turns into a Vietnam or a Beirut it would do more to shape America's
will to exert its might around the world than any presidential speech.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Peruvian economy minister sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SURPRISE removal this week of Mr Carlos Bolona as Peruvian economy
minister suggests significant changes in the austere economic stabilisation
programme he has masterminded for almost two years.
President Alberto Fujimori chose to remove Mr Bolona from his post when the
entire current cabinet, as is traditional at year's end, placed their jobs
at his disposition.
Differences had been growing between Mr Fujimori and Mr Bolona over the
economic programme. Mr Fujimori personally intervened in mid-December with
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, pleading for greater
flexibility and understanding of Peru's economic plight. He has also delayed
signing an IMF loan agreement Mr Bolona spent two months negotiating.
Mr Fujimori is thought to be seeking to cut 1993 external debt payments in
order to raise domestic spending to curb poverty while increasing public
investment and job creation.
In his resignation letter, however, Mr Bolona makes clear his opposition to
what he calls 'government with an eye on opinion polls and short-term
popularity.' He said he had come under repeated pressure to print money, to
concede subsidies and privileges to economic interest groups and to use
Peru's international reserves to finance private and public-sector credit.
Mr Bolona's economic fundamentalism has made him enemies - not least in the
military, an important influence on Mr Fujimori. Businessmen, wanting a more
growth-oriented policy, also joined the ranks of his opponents.
The minister was known to have been unhappy with Mr Fujimori's April 5
institutional coup, when Congress was dissolved and the constitution
suspended. But he decided to stay on 'to maintain the viability of the
economic programme and contribute to a return to democratic
institutionality'. Now the latter objective has been achieved - through
congressional elections in November - his fear, he says, is that the former
may 'remain half way down the road'.
Oxford-educated Mr Bolona was responsible for a frontal attack on the
hyperinflation inherited from the spendthrift Alan Garca regime. Last year's
57 per cent rise in consumer prices compared with 7,650 per cent two years
earlier. The cost last year was negative growth of 3 per cent.
Under Mr Bolona, Peru experienced a remarkable transition from statism to a
free market economy. He also orchestrated Peru's new relationship with the
international financial community. Quarterly financial targets agreed with
the IMF have largely been met - in some cases exceeded - and the government
kept its promises on reduced debt payments to foreign creditors.
However, plans to pay off arrears with international financial institutions
next month and to negotiate debt reschedulings with bank and government
creditors - temporarily derailed by the April coup - will be called into
question by Mr Bolona's departure.
In the next three months Peru faces important negotiations with the Paris
Club over relief of a total debt of Dollars 7bn. A new 'support group' of
friendly countries must be formed to help cover a projected Dollars 1bn
balance of payments deficit this year, and talks are also due with
commercial banks in New York.
But pleasing the multilateral organisations dented Mr Bolona's - and hence
Mr Fujimori's - popularity at home. Accusations of a lack of 'social
sensitivity' have surrounded monthly payments of about Dollars 60m to
creditors while less than that was spent in a year on alleviating poverty.

FT  07 JAN 93 / US budget casts Clinton's goal into doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton cannot fulfil his campaign promise of halving
the budget deficit within four years without imposing strict controls on
popular 'entitlement' programmes such as federal health care, according to
Mr Richard Darman, the Bush administration's budget director.
On unchanged policies, the budget deficit would not fall substantially below
Dollars 300bn (Pounds 194.8bn) for the foreseeable future, a final skeleton
budget from the Bush administration indicated yesterday.
Mr Darman's figures show the deficit rising to Dollars 327.3bn this fiscal
year, declining modestly to Dollars 266.4bn in fiscal 1996 and then rising
again to Dollars 319.8bn in fiscal 1998.
This compares with projections in last year's budget that the deficit would
decline to just over Dollars 200bn by 1996.
The difference reflects much less optimistic revenue projections in this
year's budget, partly as a result of more realistic growth assumptions.
Projected revenue over five years is more than Dollars 200bn lower than
assumed last January.
However, Mr Clinton's advisers said Mr Darman was still underplaying the
extent of the fiscal deterioration by assuming that discretionary domestic
spending would be frozen in cash terms from 1995 onwards, an unrealistic
assumption. They said prospective deficits were Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn
higher than assumed at last month's economic conference in Little Rock and
unless checked could soar above Dollars 400bn towards the end of the decade.
Mr Darman warned that efforts to curb the deficit by stimulating growth were
doomed to fail. On his figures, in the absence of tax and spending measures,
a halving of the deficit to about Dollars 150bn by fiscal 1996 would require
four years of real growth averaging 4.4-4.8 per cent a year, a 'heroic'
assumption.
Mr Darman noted that Mr Clinton had also promised not to raise taxes on
people earning less than Dollars 200,000 a year and to use any savings from
health care cost controls to extend benefits for millions of uninsured
workers. Health care savings thus could not be used to cut the deficit.
These constraints created 'a circle that cannot be squared'.
In the absence of tax increases on middle-income families, deficit reduction
required a cap on all mandatory 'entitlement' programmes, such as health
care for the elderly and poor, with most of the savings allocated to deficit
reduction.
If increases in mandatory spending were restricted to inflation plus an
allowance for population growth, Dollars 409bn could be saved over five
years and nearly Dollars 2,000bn over a decade, according to Mr Darman's
figures. There was no scope for similar savings in any other part of the
budget.
In a carefully phrased reaction yesterday, Mr Clinton said the 'endless
pattern of rising deficits must stop. . . . We must make the difficult
choices that will allow us both to close the budget deficit and the
investment deficit that together threaten our future.'
However, the latest gloomy figures underline his fiscal dilemma. He wants to
increase federal investment spending sharply without raising taxes on the
middle classes. Yet he has not yet shown any appetite for curbing popular
entitlement programmes.
The two fastest growing are Medicare and Medicaid, the health care
programmes for the elderly and poor. According to yesterday's budget,
Medicare spending is set to rise from Dollars 129.9bn this year to Dollars
235.8bn by fiscal 1998; Medicaid from Dollars 80.5bn to Dollars 156.4bn.
Mr Darman was at pains yesterday to emphasise the strength of the economy
the Republicans were handing over. Real output had risen for seven quarters
and was set to grow 3 per cent this year. Inflation would be just over 3 per
cent and unemployment would fall to 7 per cent by year end.

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN minutes of British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's arrival in
Argentina yesterday President Carlos Menem reiterated strongly his country's
claim to the disputed Falkland Islands.
Mr Menem said on TV that 'before the year 2000, Argentina' would be 'setting
foot on the Falklands, without any type of conflict.'
Mr Hurd, who is to meet Mr Menem today, repeated at Buenos Aires airport
Britain's refusal to discuss sovereignty of the Falklands, over which the UK
fought a 1982 war. 'We have no doubt of our position, so what we have to do
is build on progress already made.'
Mr Hurd said his visit will further consolidate relations with Argentina,
with which Britain resumed diplomatic links three years ago. The two have
reached temporary fishing agreements in the South Atlantic and on military
confidence-building measures.
One of Argentina's most cherished foreign policy objectives is to assume a
more prominent role in international affairs. Mr Menem and Mr Guido di
Tella, foreign minister, will hope Mr Hurd can help them advance this goal.
However, frequent reiterations of Argentina's claim to the islands has not
advanced Mr Menem's aim to make an official visit to the UK.

world and discord at home mark president's exit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME presidents go out with a bang and some with a whimper. In his final
days George Bush seems to be managing a bit of both.
On the one side of the ledger, he has authorised military intervention for
humanitarian purposes in Somalia, signed the Start 2 treaty in Moscow, given
a final push towards concluding a multinational trade agreement and become,
at least in words, more active in pursuit of a solution in the former
Yugoslavia. He is now also threatening further military action against Iraq.
In most of these moves he has enjoyed the sort of broad bipartisan support
at home that characterised the high days of his presidency. Mr Bill Clinton,
who takes over in two weeks, has publicly endorsed everything and Mr Bush
has repaid the compliment by saying the nicest of things in Moscow and in
Paris last weekend about his successor.
On the other side, in the starkest of contrasts, stands the pardon on
Christmas Eve of Mr Caspar Weinberger and five others for any charges
connected with the Iran-Contra scandals.
That act, and the defensive justification he gave for it, has brought a ton
of critical bricks on his head for having short-circuited due legal process,
as well as the threat of continued investigation into his own role in the
affair even after he leaves office.
Mr Bush was not president during Iran-Contra. But there are legacies of his
term, such as the courting of Iraq and the improper searches into Mr
Clinton's passport records, which have the capacity to haunt him in the
future and which, in part of the public mind, serve to offset whatever
warmth may be due him for having done the 'right' things in the last two
months.
Previous presidents have behaved variously in their final days. On the
reflective side, Mr Dwight Eisenhower, who came to the office from the army,
surprised many with his valedictory warnings about the dangerous growth of a
military-industrial complex in the US. Mr Jimmy Carter spoke, more
predictably, about the risks of nuclear proliferation.
Mr Lyndon Johnson's last act, however, seemed to some more vindictive as he
had his administration bring a massive anti-trust suit against International
Business Machines, which consumed US courts for a decade to come.
Mr Ronald Reagan and Mr Gerald Ford faded on to the speaking circuit and the
golf course respectively, though Mr Ford had begun office with the pardon of
President Richard Nixon for any Watergate crimes. Mr Nixon, consumed by
Watergate, never had the time for final thoughts or action from the White
House, though his subsequent reflections have been voluminous.
Mr Bush, a self-confessed unreflective man, has not so far tied together the
activity of his concluding weeks in any thematic way. Two speeches, in Texas
last month and at West Point on Tuesday, were no more than recitations of
the changes that had taken place in the world on his watch and some very
generalised thoughts on the use of force.
Indeed the common thread of the transitional activity is not easy to find.
Actions such as the Start 2 treaty and the continuing Uruguay Round talks
mostly represent a continuation of policies long in train, though -
especially in trade - not always firmly on track. Both constitute the 'old'
way of doing things, albeit, in the case of Moscow, with different partners.
Yet both Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin had their own good
reasons for pushing arms control and were active suitors of the president in
three arms agreements.
The Somali initiative and the harder verbal line on Bosnia were, in effect,
born after Mr Bush had lost the election and the constant and generally
cautious advice of Mr James Baker. Both can be said to have been created in
a policy and political vacuum, certainly influenced but not necessarily
critically, by the wave of publicity that the plights of both countries were
exciting.
Mr Bush has also had to be careful not to tie Mr Clinton's hands with
commitments at which the next administration might balk. But he seems to
have sensed that his successor is likely to be active in foreign policy,
though not necessarily always interventionist, in areas such as humanitarian
policies that were never accorded the highest priority in his own
government.
Mr Clinton could return the favours by calling the government investigative
hounds off Mr Bush's trail, much as Mr Ford sought to calm the country by
pardoning Mr Nixon. The difference is that neither Iran-Contra, nor
Iraqgate, nor any other attendant matter has quite reached the critical mass
that was Watergate: equally, no matter how charitable his inclinations, Mr
Clinton might not want to start his brave new administration by appearing to
condone secretive and possibly illegal practices in the one just past.
So Mr Bush goes out no longer feeling disconnected and with the
international strings playing sweet and fond farewells but the domestic bass
section rumbling in discord. This was the story of his presidency anyway.

FT  07 JAN 93 / New job for Mexican debt chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S chief debt negotiator for more than a decade, Mr Jose Angel Gurria,
is leaving the finance ministry where he is under-minister for international
finance. He will take over Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext),
the state-run export-import bank.
Known for his good humour, and outstanding sales talk, Mr Gurria will be
missed on the international finance circuit.
He was co-ordinator of Mexico's external debt in 1979, when the country was
borrowing money from any bank that would lend, and was still in the job
(with a progressively more senior title) when Mexico defaulted on its debt
in 1982, reached agreement with its creditors in 1989, and resumed borrowing
in the 1990s.
His transfer to Bancomext is technically a promotion. He will be given a
remit to expand its role, in line with the government's desire to boost
exports from medium and small companies.
His functions will be taken over by Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the finance
ministry's principal under-minister.
The international finance under-ministry is being wound up, a decision that
reflects to an extent the end of debt as an issue for Mexico. Its net
debt-to-GDP ratio is now about 29 per cent of GDP, against 62 per cent in
1988.
Mr Gurria's move marks the end of a series of ministerial changes that are
likely to be the last significant ones of President Carlos Salinas's
administration. On Monday the president replaced Mr Fernando Gutierrez
Barrios as interior minister with Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, governor
of Chiapas, and Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the attorney-general, with the
president of the National Human Rights Commission, Mr Jorge Carpizo.
This latter appointment has been well received by human rights groups inside
and outside Mexico, and may have been intended to deflect criticisms of the
country's human rights record in hearings on the proposed North American
Free Trade Agreement.
By contrast, Mr Gonzalez Garrido has a reputation as a tough governor. His
appointment may thus signify a change in policy at the interior ministry,
which, under Mr Gutierrez Barrios, has favoured negotiation with opposition
groups.
Mr Gonzalez Garrido is not considered a likely presidential candidate, and
the president may have decided to put him, rather than a better known
politician in the post, to ensure the all-important interior ministry is
free to make tough decisions in the run-up to next year's presidential
election.
Mexico's economy grew by 2.8 per cent last year, Mr Pedro Aspe, finance
minister, said yesterday. This was a little higher than the most recent
official forecast but well short of the government's original hopes. He
expected growth of around 3 per cent this year.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Domestic boost for Renault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, sold 2m cars and light commercial
vehicles last year, a 6.7 per cent increase on the previous year and the
highest figure since 1983.
Mr Patrick Faure, commercial director, attributed most of the improvement to
a strong rise in sales in France, where Renault increased its market share
nearly 3 points to 29.6 per cent, overtaking its private-sector rival
Peugeot.
French car registrations overall grew by 3.7 per cent last year to 2.1m, due
to a surge in demand in December, according to the French car makers'
committee (CCFA).
Renault increased its share of the European car market from 10 per cent to
10.7 per cent. Its European sales rose by 5.7 per cent in a market down by 1
per cent, making it one of the few producers, along with VAG and Opel, to
increase sales in the region for two consecutive years.
Renault's sales fell slightly in the depressed German market, although the
Clio and R19 remained the two most popular foreign models there. Sales also
fell in Italy, as the lira's devaluation hit price competitiveness.
The French group managed to shrug off the impact of sterling's devaluation
and increase car sales to Britain by 14.5 per cent.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Heads of Hungary radio and television resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE political dispute over control of Hungary's media came to a head
yesterday when the heads of the state television and radio tendered their
resignations in protest at government interference.
The two men made a joint announcement conceding their defeat by the
conservative government, which has long sought their removal.
The final straws, said Mr Elemer Hankiss, president of Hungarian Television,
were parliament's failure last week to pass a new law protecting the
independence of the media and the government's recent decision to bring
control of state TV finances directly under the prime minister's office.
'This means even the illusion of independence has gone,' Mr Hankiss said.
The resignations heighten the dispute between the government, the opposition
and journalists which has poisoned Hungary's political atmosphere since
elections in 1990.
Conservative coalition politicians and Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister,
repeatedly complain that the bleak picture of the government painted by the
media is unwarranted. Right-wing politicians also say many journalists are
hostile.
The opposition and most journalists claim that the government is overly
sensitive to criticism and tends to be authoritarian. The government's
opponents also maintain Mr Antall's coalition, which is languishing in
opinion polls, is trying to ensure more positive coverage in the run-up to
parliamentary elections next year.
Yesterday's resignations could lead to a constitutional crisis if Mr Arpad
Goncz, Hungary's president and a member of the opposition Alliance of Free
Democrats, becomes involved. The president and the premier have already
clashed over appointments of state media executives.
Mr Goncz rejected Mr Antall's nominations on the grounds they constituted a
threat to 'the democratic order'. The government's response was to label Mr
Goncz's actions unconstitutional and threaten to impeach him. The media
heads' departure is linked to the battle for control in the governing
Hungarian Democratic Forum between Mr Antall's moderate conservatives and
the far-right camp of Mr Istvan Csurka, a leading member of the party.
Dismissal of the media heads was one of the main planks of Mr Csurka's
extremist manifesto, alongside attacks on Jews, communists, liberals and the
Trianon territorial settlement of 1920, when Hungary lost two thirds of its
former territory, and a third of its population was left outside its new
borders.
Mr Csurka followed his attacks by leading demonstrations to the central TV
building to demand a purge. Mr Antall's advisers claim many of his moves
against Mr Hankiss were forced by the party's strong populist wing.
Political attention now turns to the Forum's party congress later this month
which will be a test of strength between the prime minister and his
extremist challenger.

<TEXT>
MR Cyrus Vance, one of the two international mediators on the former
Yugoslavia, met Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's hardline president, in
Belgrade yesterday to persuade him to press Bosnia's Serbs to drop their
opposition to peace proposals.
Mr Milosevic, whose co-operation is considered vital for any peace
initiative to succeed, said before meeting Mr Vance that he would 'support
any plan that would bring peace' to Bosnia-Herceg-ovina.
A spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the other co-chairman of the Geneva
peace conference, said that, during the meeting, the Serbian president again
expressed his willingness to support the peace effort. Mr Vance, asked later
if he believed Mr Milosevic would persevere with the peace plan, replied:
'That is what he said. I am reporting what he said.'
Lord Owen was due to join Mr Vance in Belgrade before flying to Zagreb for
talks with Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian
Serbs, and his military colleagues would accept a number of crucial
constitutional measures in the Vance-Owen plan, even if Mr Milosevic applied
pressure on them.
Mr Karadzic, who had talks with Mr Milosevic on Tuesday, was quoted as
saying: 'We would appreciate any suggestion of Mr Milosevic's, but only if
it is acceptable to us.'
At the Geneva negotiations between the warring factions Mr Karadzic rejected
the co-chairmen's proposals for an independent, sovereign state of
Bosnia-Hercegovina divided into 10 largely autonomous provinces.
Mr Karadzic made it clear that the Bosnian Serbs wanted to create their own
independent state within Bosnia, while the co-chairmen have specified that
the 10 proposed provinces would have no international legal identity of
their own. Mr Vance and Lord Owen have stressed that the international
community would not countenance an independent Bosnian Serb state, which
would aim to become part of a Greater Serbia.
In Belgrade Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia
and Montenegro, urged Bosnian Serbs to compromise or risk western military
intervention.
Meanwhile, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, told the cabinet in
Paris that the three warring factions in Bosnia had agreed in principle to
declare Sarajevo an open city and that forces besieging the capital would
withdraw 30km from the city after a ceasefire.
The city has been calm recently but last night Bosnian radio said fierce
fighting had broken out in many districts.

<TEXT>
SPAIN'S reserves, which were hard hit in the battle to secure the peseta
during the currency turmoil last year, improved by nearly Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) last month to finish the year at Dollars 50.4bn, writes Tom
Burns in Madrid.
Although Spain holds a relatively large volume of reserves by European
standards, the end-of-year figure represented a net fall in 1992 of Dollars
15.7bn. This was the first annual drop since 1985.
According to provisional figures released by the Bank of Spain, reserves
fell from Dollars 71.2bn at the end of August last year to Dollars 47.5bn at
the end of November.
The peseta was devalued by 5 per cent on September 17 and by a further 6 per
cent on November 21.
It now appears to be comfortable at its new parity within the exchange rate
mechanism of the EMS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, denied yesterday the outgoing
government planned to abandon its defence of the punt and said it would be
up to the new administration to review its exchange rate policy.
A new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is expected to be formed next week.
The minister said on Irish radio that the present government had
'unequivocally and consistently supported the existing parity of the Irish
pound and has done so simply because it is the best policy for the long-term
benefit of the Irish economy. I have. . . argued that since the Maastricht
treaty was defeated in the Danish referendum on June 2.'
Mr Ahern said he could not pre-empt or speak on behalf of the incoming
government. This would be 'entirely wrong'. He stressed: 'I have no reason
at this time to believe that the new government, if it is Fianna Fail and
the Labour party, would change that policy.'
He added that a report in the Financial Times on Tuesday had 'grossly
misinterpreted' statements made by him on Monday evening in which he said:
'I said I was prepared to hold the line until the end of the year. That has
now passed. If the system does not correct itself. . . the pressures on
industry are something that cannot be lived with indefinitely'.
He had emphasised his continued opposition to a unilateral devaluation, but
added this was an issue 'the new government will have to look at very early
on'.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, told parliament on Monday he hoped
to be in a position to form a new coalition government by early next week
'if budgetary matters can be agreed'. His Fianna Fail party and Labour have
been negotiating terms for forming a coalition since the November 25 general
election, in which no party won an overall majority.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Chernomyrdin's price controls are deceptive move: The new
Russian prime minister has not yet, as many assumed, proved himself an
anti-reformer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S new prime minister raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he announced
that price controls would be imposed on a number of basic foodstuffs.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, many were tempted to conclude, had begun his career
as Russian premier in the conservative manner forecast for him.
However, the announcement was both weaker than it appeared, and is beside
the main point of economic reform of this year.
He has not proved himself an anti-reformer yet.
First, the main fear of the government is not rising prices but rising
unemployment. People have been (relatively) stoic about prices: they are not
expected to be when cast adrift from the enterprises and institutions which
had guaranteed them a minimum living and a range of social benefits.
Mr Feodor Prokopov, the head of the Russian employment service, said
yesterday in an interview with a Russian newspaper that while the expected
high unemployment rates had not emerged in 1992, 'I fear that this time our
forecasts will become reality: the problem of unemployment might emerge as
the most serious facing Russia. In 1993 we predict that there will be 5m
unemployed'.
Coping with this will be hard: while much had been done in setting up
employment centres and training programmes, they are untested: and the
minimum dole is very close to absolute want.
However, at the same time, the government must also make sure the process of
privatisation of large companies becomes a reality - a matter which, Mr
Chernomyrdin agreed in his speech to business people on Tuesday, was at the
heart of the reform process.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation,
said on television on Tuesday evening that 'based on the experience we
already have (with the first large-scale privatisations) we intend to begin,
from the middle of January, mass auctions of big companies throughout
Russia'.
If unemployment and its discontents are not to overwhelm reform, the state -
as President Boris Yeltsin said last month in his speech to parliament -
must become stronger.
First, it must battle more effectively against crime: figures out yesterday
from the interior ministry showed now-familiar but shocking rises, with
crime up nearly 30 per cent over the year in Moscow and serious crime up
nearly 50 per cent.
Mr Chernomyrdin made a feature of that in his speech, too: but the law and
order agencies, so good in the past at repression, have yet to become
efficient in crime detection.
It must also develop an efficient tax collection system: as throughout all
of the post-communist world, the post-Soviet states have been strapped for
cash because they cannot collect it from their citizens and enterprises in
conditions of relative economic freedom.
From the first of this month, the tax system has been 'remoulded' towards
encouraging investment: 50 per cent of company income which is set aside for
investment will be freed from tax, and import duties cut on investment goods
and abolished on the necessities, such as grain and medicine.
However,the government must also give some concrete signs that it cares.
Hence the announcement on price control - though in fact, it amounted only
to a slight widening of already existing controls. Mr Chernomyrdin's decree
covers bread, macaroni, tea, salt, sugar, milk, butter, meat, children's
food and vodka: but these were already controlled where they were produced
by monopoly companies (as most were) and are anyway controlled not by
absolute price ceilings but by means of a restriction on enterprises profits
of between 10 and 25 per cent of sales.
It will not cause prices to fall, according to Mr Vladimir Safonov, deputy
head of the Price Commission - but would stop 'another jump in prices'.
The main cost to the state will be - as it already is - in bread subsidies,
running at between Rbs2-3bn a day, in order to keep the breads price at or
below Rbs48 a kilo.
Little more can be subsidised unless the budget is bust: and, as Mr
Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the parliament's budget committee, noted
yesterday, the government has submitted no law on extra subsidies to the
parliament and the present budget contains no room for such extra spending.
Mr Pochinok said that estimates of the total budget for this year would be
between the astonishingly wide margins of Rbs30,000bn and Rbs50,000bn: he
forecast a deficit of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent of gross domestic
product by the year end.
Total subsidies planned for 1993 would probably exceed Rbs1,000bn, Mr
Pochinok said. Bread subsidies alone would cost between Rbs2bn and Rbs3bn a
day.
Russian budget deficits are imprecise matters: but if Mr Chernomyrdin and
the cabinet he inherited from Mr Yego Gaidar is to remain in charge of
finances, it must be controlled.
This will be the major constraint: Mr Chernomyrdin is in no different
position from his predecessor, and so far shows every sign of knowing it.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Rise in jobless may bury French Socialists: Tensions grow
between Paris and employers as unemployment total heads for 3m

<TEXT>
THE latest job losses at Peugeot set the scene for increased tensions
between employers and a French government desperately seeking to save face
before the parliamentary election at the end of March.
The loss of almost 2,600 jobsat the French car maker this week is but the
most recent in a grim series of industrial job cuts expected to reach a
record 600,000 when the final toll for 1992 is counted. By the first 10
months of last year, the total had reached 436,000, 12 per cent more than
the same period in 1991.
Most of the big names in French business have been forced by the economic
slowdown to take an axe to their workforces, including Aerospatiale, the
aerospace group, Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truck maker, Bull and
IBM France in computers and Usinor Sacilor, the steel group.
All this could not have come at a worse time for the administration. The
Socialists' inability to turn back unemployment, now just short of 3m, will
be the big theme in the election, in which the latest polls indicate the
government is set for a thrashing.
The growing army of jobless, 10.4 per cent of the workforce at the latest
count, is the one issue that threatens the cross-party consensus on the need
to defend the franc and has been marked out by both right and left as the
main battleground for the election campaign.
'I think nobody would dream of attacking social achievements,' said
President Francois Mitterrand in his traditional new year address, a clear
bid to hold the high ground on social policy against an incoming right-wing
government.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, hit back by claiming
that social achievements had been 'deeply called into question for the past
several years,' and warned that he would fight to restore the balance.
Both right and left feel uncomfortably short of answers to unemployment,
their main political problem, on which fringe parties like the ecologists
and National Front have capitalised.
'Companies are making job losses too soon, too fast and too hard,'
complained Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister, on the day of the Peugeot
job losses. She inflamed the Patronat employers' organisation by accusing it
of being politically biased and calling on it to 'speak to companies which
abuse the use of job losses'. Her plans for increased worksharing, reviewing
high social charges and improved training have failed to impress employers.
A related irritant in relations between the state and private industry has
been the wrangle over who will bail out the Unedic unemployment pay system.
It is jointly funded by employers and unions and designed to pay redundant
workers for a period before they receive state benefits, but is nearing
bankruptcy partly because of a sharp rise in the number of people coming off
state-funded temporary work. Yesterday, Mrs Aubry unwillingly compromised by
agreeing to contribute FFr3.25bn (Pounds 390m) to Unedic's FFr23bn deficit.
The Patronat, already internally divided over the merits of the government's
tough exchange rate policy, is deeply worried over just where the debate
over unemployment will lead. Already the Socialists have taken practical
steps to clamp down on lay-offs, by passing a law just before Christmas
which significantly strengthened the employers' obligation to help redundant
workers find new jobs or risk having the job losses overturned by the
government.
The Patronat argues that France has almost returned to the rigid old system
whereby redundancies had to be cleared by the public authorities, abandoned
by the last Gaullist government in 1986. 'It is a major step backwards,'
said one Patronat official yesterday.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Domestic boost for Renault sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, sold 2m cars and light commercial
vehicles last year, a 6.7 per cent increase on the previous year and the
highest figure since 1983.
Mr Patrick Faure, commercial director, attributed most of the improvement to
a strong rise in sales in France, where Renault increased its market share
by nearly 3 points to 29.6 per cent, overtaking its private-sector rival
Peugeot.
French car registrations overall grew by 3.7 per cent last year to 2.1m, due
to a surge in demand in December, according to the French car makers'
committee (CCFA).
Renault increased its share of the European car market from 10 per cent to
10.7 per cent. Its European sales rose by 5.7 per cent in a market down by 1
per cent, making it one of the few producers, along with VAG and Opel, to
increase sales in the region for two consecutive years.
However, Renault's sales fell slightly in the depressed German market,
although the Clio and R19 remained the two most popular foreign models
there. Sales also fell in Italy, as the lira's devaluation hit price
competitiveness.
The French group managed to shrug off the impact of sterling's devaluation
and increase car sales to Britain by 14.5 per cent.
In a separate move, Renault and its Swedish partner Volvo yesterday
reinforced their links in the French market by appointing Mr Loc Caperan,
Renault's commercial director for France, as president of the administrative
board of Volvo Automobiles France.
Mr Hans Hoglund, vice-president of Volvo Car, in charge of commercial
relations with Renault, was nominated managing director of Volvo's French
arm.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Irish overnight rate raised as pressure on punt grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY TENSIONS inside the European exchange rate mechanism intensified
yesterday after Ireland's central bank was forced to announce a sharp rise
in money market interest rates to try to halt selling of the punt.
The Irish authorities announced that the overnight rate for lending punts
would be raised from 14 per cent to 50 per cent, effective from today. The
move came after the currency fell to its ERM floor against two of the
strongest currencies in the system, the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder.
The Irish authorities continued to pledge that there would be no devaluation
of the currency. Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, said yesterday
that he 'unequivocally and consistently supported the existing parity of the
punt'.
The announcement of the rise in rates came after official ERM trading had
closed at 4pm London time. However, it was not enough to stop the punt
trading below its floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder in late
trading in London.
By contrast, the French franc appreciated sharply against the D-Mark,
following a strong show of determination by the French and German central
banks earlier this week to defend the currency's existing ERM parity. The
franc rose by more than a centime against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.409 in
London. It closed at FFr3.40525 in New York. French money market rates also
eased, with the overnight rate falling to 12 1/2 per cent from 15 per cent
on Tuesday.
Dealers in the French franc and the punt were waiting to see whether the
Bundesbank would ease its interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting
today.
However, the Bundesbank announced that there would be no press conference
following the council meeting, which is sometimes interpreted as a sign that
there will be no change in rates.
Speculation of a possible easing in German rates continued to help sterling.
The pound gained another pfennig to close at DM2.52, after gaining nearly 6
pfennigs the previous day. But sterling was slightly weaker against the
dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5420 against Dollars 1.5455 on Tuesday. In New
York it closed at DM2.52025 and Dollars 1.5423.
The punt closed in London at BFr53.90 and Fl 2.9505 - levels broadly held in
New York.
The selling of punts followed two days of relative calm since Ireland lifted
its exchange controls at the beginning of the year. Mr Jim O'Leary of Davy
Stockbrokers of Dublin, said: 'The removal of exchange controls in their
entirety on the first of January has permitted a type of speculative attack
on the Irish pound that was hitherto not possible.'
Dealers said selling of the punt had been exacerbated by doubts about the
Bundesbank's intentions on interest rates and uncertainty about whether a
new coalition government due to be formed next week would continue to
maintain the punt's parity within the ERM.
Some also pointed to remarks made on Monday evening by Mr Ahern that the
coalition might have to review the country's exchange rate policy if
pressures in the EMS continued.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Bundesbank monetary policy criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has lurched into recession partly because the Bundesbank has made
wrong monetary policy decisions, the DIW institute in Berlin claimed
yesterday.
Unless the central bank cuts interest rates quickly, the economy will weaken
further until well into this year and the Europe-wide slump will drag on
into 1994, it warned. Continuing decline, underlined yesterday by news that
west German industrial output in November was almost 6 per cent down on a
year earlier, was unavoidable, said the institute, one of Germany's five
leading economics centres.
The causes lay in pay negotiators' reacting too late to early signs of a
slowdown and wrong monetary policy decisions since mid-1992.
Last year's wage deals led to a 5.4 per cent increase in west German unit
labour costs, according to DIW. The Bundesbank, which controls German
monetary policy, caused widespread dismay in July when it raised its
discount rate from 8 per cent to 8.75 per cent.
It responded to the European monetary crisis in September with a reduction
to 8.25 per cent and a disappointing 0.25 percentage point cut to 9.5 per
cent in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate.
The institute's criticism came as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the
central bank, repeated that it would be wrong to change tack too soon to
help resolve 'short-term' economic problems, either in Germany or elsewhere.
Monetary policy had to continue its role as a brake on inflation, he said.
'That task has not yet ended,' he told a conference organised by the
Norwegian Confederation of Business and Industry.
He could not anticipate a decision to reduce interest rates but claimed that
the central bank's 'ambitious' new money supply growth targets laid a
foundation to allow Germany's economic weakness to be overcome.
There has been growing domestic as well as international pressure on the
Bundesbank to cut rates. German industry has been more openly critical of
higher interest rates recently. Bonn has made no secret of its desire to see
rates reduced although ministers and officials are anxious not to be seen to
put any political pressure on the Bundesbank. Mr Schlesinger also told the
Oslo meeting that early relaxation would not be good for European monetary
integration. He said the D-Mark's role as an anchor of stability must be
maintained.
According to DIW, the Bundesbank must take the lead and allow other European
central banks to cut rates. Even rapid and substantial reductions would not
now produce benefits until the second half of this year.
The institute said it expected gross domestic product in the west to fall 1
per cent this year. Average inflation would remain high at 4 per cent,
double the Bundesbank's 'stability' target of 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, new industrial production figures added to the gloom. Seasonally
adjusted output from west German mining and manufacturing industries in
November was 5.8 per cent down on the same month in 1991, the economics
ministry reported. Total production was more than 1 per cent lower than in
October.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Airtours in Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest package holiday company, yesterday launched
a hostile Pounds 221m all-share bid for its larger rival, Owners Abroad, in
a move that could provide a substantial challenge to the market leader,
Thomson.
The bid, which Owners Abroad immediately rejected as inadequate, would, if
successful, leave Thomson and the enlarged Airtours with nearly 60 per cent
of the holiday tour market and might trigger a referral to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Airtours' offer is dependent on Owners Abroad's shareholders not accepting
the terms of a previously proposed link with Thomas Cook, the travel agent
and banking services chain now controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank of
Germany.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours' founder and chairman, said the proposed merger
would create 'a very significant force in the UK travel industry'.
The combined group would account for 26 per cent of the UK holiday market,
behind Thomson, which has 33 per cent.
Mr Crossland did not expect the deal to be referred to the Monopolies
Commission. Airtours had made 'exhaustive inquiries' about the possibility
of a referral.
The Office of Fair Trading is understood to have given Airtours non-binding
'confidential guidance' that the merger would not be referred.
The Airtours bid leaves open the question of whether Thomas Cook will want
to take a more substantial financial stake in Owners Abroad.
Under the current proposal, the company would make a net cash injection of
only Pounds 2m although it is taking a 10 per equity stake.
Owners Abroad yesterday postponed tomorrow's extraordinary general meeting
at which shareholders would have voted on the Thomas Cook deal.
Airtours is offering three new ordinary shares for every eight Owners Abroad
shares, valuing this part of the bid at 113p last night after Airtours'
share price slipped 19p to close at 302p. Owners Abroad shares closed up 11p
at 120p.
It is also offering 188.5 convertible preference shares for 100 Owners
Abroad convertible shares, valuing these shares at about 194p.
There is a partial cash alternative, fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd and The British Linen Bank.
Airtours is also proposing to raise Pounds 49.5m by way of a placing, with
clawback, of convertible preference shares.
BZW is advising Airtours and Samuel Montagu is advising Owners Abroad.

FT  07 JAN 93 / Tanker owner defends crew: Government plans inquiry as oil
continues to pour from stricken ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SUMBURGH, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPANY which operates the Braer, the Liberian-registered tanker which
lies wrecked and spilling oil on the coast of Shetland, last night defended
the master and crew of the ship against criticism of their handling of the
emergency.
Mr Mike Hudner, chief executive of the B&amp;H group, the New York-based
operator, said: 'Suggestions that the crew should have remained on board as
the ship went aground conflict with our belief that human life takes
priority over all other considerations.
'The safety of the crew must come first. The coastguard authorities are in
no doubt that the total evacuation of the ship was absolutely necessary to
guarantee their survival.'
He was speaking after critical comments from the owner of a tug sent to aid
the stricken vessel on Tuesday morning as it was being blown on to the rocks
by force 10 winds. The tug owner, Mr Barry Cork, had expressed anger that
when his tug had reached the Braer no one was available on the tanker for
two hours to try to take a tow line.
Mr Hudner also defended the route taken by the ship on its voyage from
Norway to Canada, which ran through the 22-mile-wide channel between
Sumburgh and Fair Isle where it was hit by storm-force winds.
Oil was continuing to pour from the Braer's punctured tanks yesterday as a
pollution control operation began. The wind had subsided since Tuesday but
it was still blowing from a westerly direction, confining much of the oil
slick to Quendale Bay where the ship lies.
The Braer had shifted slightly since Tuesday and though its stern is
underwater with the bow above the water it appears that its back has not
been broken. About half the oil on board may have already leaked out.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the Marine Accident
Investigation Branch would hold an inquiry. Lord Caithness, shipping
minister, said the inquiry would exceed the usual investigation of
shipwrecks.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office environment and agriculture minister, said
Shetland would not be 'out of pocket' as a result of the disaster. He was
studying possible compensation for farmers for damage to grazing caused by
oil from the tanker showering their land.
Yesterday, five Dakota aircraft of the Department of Transport's marine
pollution unit sprayed dispersant chemicals around the ship and on the
surrounding oil slick which is between four and five miles long.
But the sea was still too rough to deploy booms to prevent the oil entering
coastal inlets.
There was also criticism of the Braer's mixed Greek and Filipino crew,
sailing under a Greek master, after an apparent delay in summoning help from
Shetland coast guards when the tanker suffered engine failure.
Mr Hudner said the Braer was 'blacked out' - losing electrical power when
the engines failed - at 4.40am and was in touch with the coast guards at
5.05am. It ordered up a tug at 5.19am.
The delay between contacting the coast guard and ordering the tug was caused
by the master's need to contact B&amp;H in New York, which would in turn have
contacted the ship's insurance underwriter. But Mr Hudner did not regard
this as a meaningful delay.
Mr Jean Gaulin, chairman and chief executive of Ultramar, the oil company
which owns the Braer's 84,000 tonne cargo, said the ship had Dollars 700m
(Pounds 460.5m) of insurance cover, which he believed was sufficient to
cover the cost of damage.
In order to win awards of over Dollars 83m claimants would need to prove the
owner guilty of gross negligence - breaching the terms of international
conventions limiting owners' liability.
Robert Gibbens in Montreal writes: Ultramar has obtained a writ to seize the
Celtic, a sister ship of the crippled Braer, from B&amp;H Shipping. Ultramar
said it was a protective move to ensure that, as the owner of the Braer's
oil cargo, it would be reimbursed for any loss. It has also filed a Dollars
25m claim against the company.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Move to change Labour's electoral
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH BID to persuade a sceptical Labour leadership to adopt a policy of
electoral reform for the House of Commons will be launched tomorrow.
But there are signs that the tide is turning against changing the
first-past-the-post system.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, who is a long-time
advocate of proportional representation, will tomorrow put the case for
reform in an article in New Statesman and Society.
He will argue, in words that are certain to revive the controversy, that PR
is essential to Labour's long-term future, especially its ability to win
votes in the south of England.
There is growing controversy over the pace of the party's internal and
policy reforms, but Labour officials insisted last night that it was still
far too early to predict the final conclusions of the Plant committee on
electoral systems.
They added that present plans meant that no conclusion or recommendation was
expected until, at the earliest, after the local government elections, which
would be held in May.
But the committee's crucial two-day session, which begins in London
tomorrow, is expected to be influenced by a growing mood within the
parliamentary Labour party against any change.
This has been fuelled by anger at the Liberal Democrats' failure to join
Labour in voting against the government in the Maastricht treaty 'paving'
debate in November.
Independent observers increasingly believe that widely diverging views
across the party mean that in order to avert a damaging internal schism the
staus quo is unlikely to be changed.
They have noted that Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown, identified as
leading 'modernisers' within the shadow cabinet, have appeared less
enthusiastic about electoral reform in recent months.
Mr Jeff Rooker, the Birmngham Perry Barr MP, will take up the case for
proportional represention when he tables a compromise proposal to the Plant
committee aimed at introducing a modified version of the Additional Member
System, used in Germany.
Under Mr Rooker's scheme, about 500 seats would continue to be elected on
the present basis, but 150 more would be allocated to 'best losers' from
other parties under a formula weighted to reflect the party's electoral
performance at a regional level.
Any final decision on electoral systems will have to be approved by the
National Executive Committee before being put to the party conference in the
autumn.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pennzoil to use Chevron stake to
help raise Dollars 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNZOIL, the Houston-based oil company, is using part of a controversial
share stake it built up in rival oil group Chevron more than three years ago
to help raise Dollars 350m.
In an unusual convertible issue being launched simultaneously in the US and
the London-based Euromarkets, the company is selling bonds convertible into
around 3.6m shares in Chevron. This represents just over 1 per cent of
Chevron's ordinary share capital.
Pennzoil paid Dollars 2.2bn for nearly 9 per cent of Chevron in December
1989, prompting a fierce battle between the two oil companies. It agreed
last October to reduce its stake to just over 5 per cent, or 17.2m shares,
swapping the other part of its holding for some of Chevron's US oil and gas
reserves.
The deal also marked the end of a protracted legal dispute between the two.
Chevron had claimed that Pennzoil illegally disguised an intention to gain
partial control over it.
It remained unclear whether the convertible bond issue marked the beginning
of a move by Pennzoil to dispose of its entire Chevron stake.
Investors will be able to exchange the bonds at any time over the next 10
years into Chevron shares at a premium of between 18-20 per cent over their
current value, though Pennzoil will have the right to repay the bonds after
five years at their issue price.
The coupon of between 6 3/4 -7 per cent on the bonds, which are being issued
at par, is only fractionally above the current yield on 10-year US
government paper, though Pennzoil debt only just classifies as investment
grade. It is ranked BBB and BAA2 by the two big US rating agencies, Moody's
and Standard &amp; Poor's.
The terms, which will be finalised early next week, were generally thought
attractive yesterday, and the bonds were quoted at nearly a point above
their issue price in the grey market in London late in the day.
The joint lead managers to the issue, Lehman Brothers and Lazard, hope to
sell Dollars 225m of the bonds in the US and Dollars 125m internationally,
though these amounts may be varied depending on demand. The issue is one of
the largest equity-linked deals in the international market for some time.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Boeing in super jumbo talks with two Airbus partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, is negotiating
with Deutsche Aerospace and British Aerospace over joint development of a
550 to 800 seat super jumbo aircraft which could enter service early in the
next century.
The move poses a significant threat to the European Airbus consortium,
Boeing's principal rival, which is also studying the development of a large
capacity airliner.
Deutsche Aerospace, part of Daimler-Benz, and BAe are partners in Airbus
with 37.9 per cent and 20 per cent shares respectively in the consortium. If
successful, the discussions with Boeing could lead to a sweeping realignment
in the commercial aerospace industry and undermine the cohesion of the
20-year-old Airbus consortium.
Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing,
yesterday said the company expected to sign an agreement soon with Deutsche
Aerospace to launch a joint feasibility study for a new generation super
jumbo.
BAe said it would be 'a willing partner' to enter a broad dialogue with
Boeing and other manufacturers on the feasibility of a super jumbo, which
would be expected to involve more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in
research and development costs.
Mr Hayhurst said Boeing has also had discussions on the project with several
other companies including the three big Japanese manufacturers, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.
The three Japanese companies already co-operate with Boeing on the 777 and
767 widebody programmes but were approached by Airbus to consider joining it
in the development of a large capacity airliner.
Boeing started studying the development of a super jumbo 18 months ago. Mr
Hayhurst said preliminary studies suggested room did not exist for more than
one viable super jumbo project.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine maker, said last night it was in talks with
both Boeing and Airbus about powering future 550 to 800 seat aircraft. The
two big US aero-engine manufacturers, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney,
have also been studying new heavy thrust engines to power super jumbos.
By attempting to lure Airbus partners in the joint development of a super
jumbo, Boeing is seeking to consolidate its dominant position in the large
aircraft market. Mr Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, said: 'We'll take
whatever actions necessary to do that, whether that means making major
investments in research and development, or looking at possible
international alliances.'
Boeing has a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner market. Airbus, its
main competitor, has 26 per cent.
Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group with a 37.9 per cent
stake in Airbus, said it had not had talks with Boeing over a new large
aircraft. However, it indicated it was interested in taking part in any
industry-wide feasibility study to develop a super jumbo. The other partner
in Airbus is Casa of Spain with a 4.2 per cent stake.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Airbus hits crosswinds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVELATION that Boeing is in talks with half of the Airbus consortium
about developing a super-jumbo airliner should make the governments of
Europe sit up and take notice. Airbus is the EC's most successful example of
state-sponsored industrial planning. The Boeing deal could threaten its
ultimate dissolution. It would also raise questions of competition on a
global scale, since the proposed new consortium could end up as monopoly
supplier to the top end of the world market.
The deal might be blocked by the competition authorities on either side of
the Atlantic, since US or EC airlines would have a reduced choice of
supplier. But it is conceivable that a product with development costs of
Dollars 10bn is a natural monopoly, on the grounds that the market is not
big enough to support duplication of effort. Indeed, perhaps only a
transatlantic consortium of the type proposed could undertake it. If so, to
block the deal would be to deny the market the product. It might thus be
sensible to allow the consortium to proceed and submit it to some kind of
global regulation.
The separate question then arises of why such a consortium should not
involve Airbus as a whole, rather than only two of its members. It is
perhaps too early to rule that out. If Boeing secures the agreement of the
German and British partners, there will be considerable pressure on the
French and Spanish partners to fall into line. This would have the effect of
introducing US influence into a showcase EC project. But if Airbus's
partners are already breaking ranks, the alternative might be the ultimate
demise of almost the only serious competitor Boeing faces on the world
stage.
But other steps are needed as well. The apparent willingness of the British
and German partners to consider throwing their lot in with Boeing shows how
urgent it is that Airbus's shaky structure should be strengthened. In
particular, it is high time that Airbus moved forward to the status of a
conventional public company. The French government, which is a partner
through its ownership of Aerospatiale, might not relish its new status as a
mere minority shareholder. But to the extent that Airbus is an irrational
structure, it is the fault of governments. It is the job of governments to
sort it out.
Whether Airbus deserves nurturing as a beacon of EC industrial policy is a
more debatable question. The EC is not alone in identifying aerospace as one
of the key industrial growth areas of the future. Ultimately, though, it is
no more sensible to lose money in a growing market than in a declining one.
Airbus has been a huge drain on public funds for years, and its finances
remain opaque. If it is to serve as an example of industrial policy, the
minimum requirement is that it should make the kind of profits appropriate
to a public company. Not the least argument for a conventional corporate
structure is that taxpayers would be provided with published accounts to
help them judge that for themselves.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Seducer eyes a double prize: Boeing's approach to Airbus
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Europe's most successful cross-border industrial partnership
is under threat.
By luring two of the main partners in the European Airbus consortium to
study the joint Dollars 10bn development of a new 550-800 seat super jumbo
airliner, Boeing is attempting to consolidate its own global dominance of
the civil aircraft market by driving a wedge between the four Airbus
shareholders.
The US company, which controls a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner
market, yesterday confirmed it was close to signing an agreement with
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and possibly also with British Aerospace - two of
the four Airbus partners, which also include Aerospatiale of France and Casa
of Spain - to study the development of a super jumbo.
Although Airbus officials sought to play down the implications of the Boeing
move by suggesting discussions with Dasa and BAe were only at an
'exploratory stage', the outcome of any agreement is bound to have a
profound impact on the European aircraft industry. It could lead to a
radical realignment of the entire commercial aerospace sector.
'Boeing is clearly trying to seduce some of the Airbus partners with strong
north American aspirations in an effort to destabilise the consortium which
has now become its main competitor,' said an executive of one Airbus
partner.
Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing,
said the Seattle company had initiated discussions with Dasa over the super
jumbo last year. Boeing is also discussing future supersonic aircraft
development with the German company, part of the Daimler-Benz group, and has
already agreed to exchange some engineers with Dasa.
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, is expected to warn his
partners today, during his traditional new year presentation of the
consortium's prospects, of the risks of undermining Airbus at a particularly
delicate stage in its evolution.
Over the past 20 years, Airbus has developed a broad family of aircraft, has
captured 26 per cent of the world market, and is now starting to make
inroads in the big long-distance airliner market, traditionally dominated by
the Boeing 747, with its new A330/A340 widebody jets which will be delivered
to their first airline customers later this year. But if some of the Airbus
partners are tempted into joint development projects with Boeing, it could
seriously undermine Airbus's own longer-term aircraft development projects.
Airbus, like Boeing, has also been studying the development of a 600-seat
jumbo. It has already approached the big three Japanese aerospace
manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - to become risk-sharing partners in a super
jumbo project.
'The design and development of this giant aircraft represents the next big
challenge in commercial aviation,' said Mr Adam Brown, the Airbus director
of planning. The biggest demand for such an aircraft will come from the
fast-growing Asia-Pacific air transport market, according to Mr Brown,
making it all the more attractive for Japanese and other Asian manufacturers
to participate in the studies and development of a super jumbo. Both Airbus
and Boeing believe such an aircraft could be in regular airline service
early next century.
The problem for Airbus is not only that it is having to adapt to the
recession in the airliner market, scaling back production and rescheduling
aircraft deliveries of financially strapped airline and leasing company
customers. It is also contending with the conflicting ambitions of its
partner companies and their national governments.
The current system on which the consortium is based - a French partnership
called 'Groupement d'Interest Economique' (GIE) - has also made it more
difficult for Airbus to control its own future as all strategic decisions
must first be approved by a supervisory board of representatives of the four
partner companies. Plans to transform Airbus into a public limited company
have been put on ice. But the latest strategic manoeuvres in the industry
could now renew the impetus for such a change.
Boeing's move is not the first time US manufacturers have sought to unsettle
European efforts to establish a strong commercial aerospace industry. Since
the 1960s, US companies have regularly offered to co-operate with European
manufacturers whenever the Europeans have sought to develop a new aircraft
product.
When in the 1960s Sud-Aviation, now part of the French Aerospatiale group,
was considering developing the Caravelle, McDonnell Douglas discussed
co-operation but went on to develop its own, and much more successful DC-9
jet.
When Airbus was planning to develop a shorter version of its A300 widebody
jet in the 1970s, Boeing tried to persuade British Aerospace to co-operate
in development of its 757 twin-engine airliner.
Like Airbus, Boeing is not in a position to develop on its own a new
double-decker super jumbo aircraft at a cost of Dollars 10bn or more. The US
manufacturer is currently in the process of developing a new widebody
aircraft, the 777, and is also addressing the issue of renewing other
products in its range. These include the smaller 737 narrowbody jet which
competes against the newer Airbus A320.
Boeing has relied on the big three Japanese manufacturers as important
partners on projects such as the 777 and the 767. But Boeing, which has also
discussed Japanese participation in its super jumbo feasibility studies, has
been reluctant to give the Japanese companies an equity or profit-sharing
role in its programmes. Boeing has clearly been unhappy over Airbus attempts
to forge a close relationship with the Japanese manufacturers.
Boeing's Mr Hayhurst believes there will be room for only one super jumbo
programme. By attempting to secure the support of both Dasa and BAe, two
companies keen on expanding their presence in the US, Boeing is seeking to
steal a march on its European rival.
It has timed its move carefully and cunningly, taking advantage of a moment
when moves towards greater European political and economic unity are under
strain and the European aerospace industry is undergoing a new restructuring
phase. The fact that two of the four Airbus partners are even considering
collaboration with Boeing is a sign that the Airbus partnership may be
starting to waver.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Santos acquires AGL oil assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday consolidated its leadership
of the domestic onshore energy industry by acquiring most of the upstream
oil and gas assets of Australian Gas Light (AGL) for ADollars 177.5m
(USDollars 126.7m).
The deal was well received by the financial markets. Santos shares closed 12
cents higher on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.78. AGL also
closed 12 cents higher at ADollars 2.84.
However, analysts said the deal could reduce Santos' prospects of winning
court approval for a renewed takeover offer for Sagasco Holdings, the South
Australian oil and gas group. Santos was forced to drop a ADollars 560m bid
for Sagasco in November after the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), the
federal competition watchdog, ruled it would give the group an effective
monopoly over onshore gas reserves.
Santos, which bought 19.9 per cent of Sagasco shortly after abandoning the
bid, has indicated the offer may be revived if the federal court rules
against the TPC in a hearing expected to take place in April.
'Our advice is that the takeover bid did not breach (the Trade Practices
Act) so (the AGL acquisition) does not really change that situation,' said
Mr John McArdle, commercial general manager of Santos.
The deal will significantly increase Santos' presence in Queensland, where
it will acquire the Moonie oilfield, the Moonie-Brisbane pipeline, majority
ownership of the Jackson-Moonie pipeline, 50 per cent of the Denison Trough
gas project and 83 per cent of the Roma gas fields.
Mr Len Bleasel, AGL managing director, said the sale price was ADollars 7.8m
above the book value of the assets. 'We will be using the money mainly to
retire debt and strengthen our gearing ratios with an eye to expand
downstream gas operations,' he said.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: WestLB raises Thomas Cook stake
to 86%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the acquisitive Dusseldorf-based public-sector
bank, has increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business from 10 per
cent to 86 per cent.
Despite investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting
influence over the booming German travel industry, WestLB said yesterday its
holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary was to be combined with other
travel and tourism interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik
Beteiligungs.
These include a 17 per cent stake in the Walter Kahn Verwaltungs group,
which in turn holds 30 per cent of the equity in TUI, Europe's biggest
travel agent. According to WestLB calculations, the bank's interest in Kahn
gives it a 5 per cent share in TUI.
The deal appears to mark the end of a complex process which started in June
last year when LTU, the charter flight and holidays company of which WestLB
owns 34 per cent, agreed to buy 90 per cent of Thomas Cook from the Midland
Bank. WestLB simultaneously took an option on the remainder of the stock.
The sale was concluded in September, when the purchasers paid Midland Pounds
200m plus an undisclosed proportion of Thomas Cook's 1992 profits.
As WestLB explained yesterday, LTU is left with 14 per cent in the once
British group.
Meanwhile, the bank, which has built a similarly complicated web of holdings
and cross-holdings in many industries, remains under close scrutiny by the
federal cartel authorities which are concerned over its growing power in the
travel business.
They are examining its interests in Horten, a retailing group, which has a
50 per cent share in another travel-oriented holding company, HS Touristik
Beteiligungs, with a further 25 per cent in TUI.
Although WestLB holds only 25 per cent of Horten directly, the cartel office
claims it has an indirect majority share.
The authorities recently won a temporary injunction banning Horten from
exercising its voting rights at TUI meetings. A full court hearing has been
scheduled for January 11.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philips ahead in Europe's
semiconductor rankings

<TEXT>
PHILIPS of the Netherlands fended off Intel of the US in 1992 to maintain
its 15-year record as Europe's largest semiconductor supplier, according to
figures collated by Dataquest Europe.
The Dutch company had sales of Dollars 1.12bn, just Dollars 16m ahead of
Intel, the world's largest merchant semiconductor manufacturer with
worldwide sales in excess of Dollars 5bn. Intel's success is built on its
best-selling microprocessors, including the 386 and 486 chips used in the
majority of personal computers of IBM design.
In Europe, the company's revenues grew 45 per cent, taking it from fifth to
second place. Its US competitor, Motorola, moved to third with sales of
Dollars 976m, a 26 per cent advance on the year before. European companies
Siemens and SGS-Thomson slipped to fourth and fifth places respectively.
INTEL, the US chipmaker, became the world's largest semiconductor supplier
in 1992, overtaking NEC and Toshiba of Japan, according to a market survey
published yesterday by Dataquest, the US market research group, writes
Louise Kehoe.
Intel's revenues grew by 26 per cent in the year, a rise of over Dollars
1bn. NEC and Toshiba, ranked two and three, showed a modest 4 per cent
growth.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Computer survey confirms shift
from mainframes
</HEADLINE>

MAINFRAME computer sales declined sharply in 1992, with International
Business Machines taking the brunt of the decline, according to a market
survey. IBM's mainframe computer revenues were down 21 per cent on the
previous year, analysts estimate.
Dataquest, in its annual market survey, said world sales of all types of
computers fell by Dollars 2.5bn, to Dollars 104.5bn.
It said the decline reflected the sluggish worldwide economy; the shift from
mainframes to client/server networks; and a significant reduction in the
cost of technology, coupled with heavy discounting by manufacturers
struggling to maintain market share.
Mainframe computer sales fell almost 16 per cent from the previous year to
Dollars 22.5bn in 1992. But sales of mid-range computers, workstations and
personal computers increased, with PCs showing the strongest growth, up 7
per cent at Dollars 46.5bn.
Sales of mid-range computers, minicomputers commonly used as 'servers' in PC
networks, surpassed mainframe sales for the first time. 'However, this
should not be taken as the death of the mainframe market,' said Ms Nancy
Stewart, senior industry analyst in Dataquest's Worldwide Computer Systems
and Peripherals Group. Mainframes still account for 22.5 per cent of total
computer systems sales, she noted. 'It is expected, however, that the shift
in buyer preference away from mainframes . . . will continue to erode the
mainframe's share of the total worldwide computer systems market,' she
added.
The trend was recently acknowledged by IBM, which is cutting investment in
mainframe technology development and reducing its workforce.
But IBM still holds a clear lead in the mainframe market, with 1992 sales of
Dollars 11.8bn representing 52.2 per cent of the world market.
In the PC market, IBM also leads, although its winning margin has narrowed
over the past year. According to Dataquest, IBM's PC revenues were Dollars
5.8bn last year, with Apple computer gaining market share to reach Dollars
5.5bn.

FORD unveils today the Mondeo, a large family car, designed to be the US
carmaker's first 'world car'.
The Mondeo, which will be produced in Europe and North America, has been
developed at a cost of around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.86bn) in Ford's most
ambitious programme so far.
It will replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in March, and
the Ford Tempo/ Mercury Topaz in North America, where it will be launched in
the first half of 1994.
The Mondeo is being positioned in one of the most fiercely contested
segments of the European new car market, where it will compete with General
Motors' Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, the Volkswagen Passat and the Peugeot
405.
This is the segment targeted by Japanese carmakers for their first
European-built cars. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are all now producing the
Mondeo's competitors at their new UK plants. At the same time, Citroen, the
French carmaker, is launching its new Xantia range soon, to replace the BX
in this segment and Renault will also replace its ageing Renault 21 model.
In Europe the Mondeo will be built at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium, which
has a capacity to produce around 440,000 a year.
Ford claims the front-wheel-drive Mondeo will be the first car in its class
to offer features such as electronic traction control to eliminate wheel
spin and adaptive suspension damping to improve ride and handling.

FORD unveils the Mondeo, a large family car, designed to be the US
carmaker's first 'world car', today.
The Mondeo, which will be produced in both Europe and North America, has
been developed at a cost of around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.86bn) in Ford's
most ambitious programme so far.
It will replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in March, and
the Ford Tempo/ Mercury Topaz in North America, where it will be launched in
the first half of 1994.
The Mondeo is being positioned in one of the most fiercely contested
segments of the European new car market, where it will compete with General

405.
This is the segment targeted by Japanese carmakers for their first
European-built cars. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are all now producing the
Mondeo's competitors at their new UK plants. At the same time, Citroen, the
French carmaker, is launching its new Xantia range soon, to replace the BX
in this segment and, later this year, Renault will also replace its ageing
Renault 21. Rover is launching its new Rover 600 to replace the out-dated
Montego in the spring.
In Europe the Mondeo will be built at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium, which
has a capacity to produce around 440,000 a year.
In an important reform of its labour practices Ford is introducing for the
first time in Europe three-shift round-the-clock working on the Mondeo
assembly line at Genk. The Mondeo development programme has taken around 5
1/2 years and is the first time that Ford has developed a common, mainstream
car for manufacture and sale in Europe and in North America. Most of the
development has been carried out by Ford of Europe at its technical centres
in the UK and Germany.
The Mondeo will start production next year at Ford's Kansas City plant with
a capacity to produce 250,000 cars a year.
Ford claims the front-wheel-drive Mondeo will be the first car in its class
to offer features such as electronic traction control to eliminate wheel
spin and adaptive suspension damping to improve ride and handling.

FT  06 JAN 93 / A model to smash the mould: Ford's fortunes are riding on
the success of its new family car, launched today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the biggest roll of the dice in its history Ford today unveils a range of
large family cars, the Mondeo, which is destined to determine its fortunes
in Europe and north America during the 1990s.
The gamble comes with a price tag of about Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn), as Ford
seeks to demonstrate that, for the first time, it is capable of developing a
range which can be both manufactured and sold in the two continents.
The six-year Mondeo programme, code-named CDW27 since its conception in the
mid-1980s, is the most ambitious and costly programme undertaken by the US
vehicle maker. It marks a radical break with Ford tradition.
The Fiestas, Escorts, Sierras and Granada/Scorpios sold in Europe have
little, if anything, in common with the Ford Escorts, Tempos, Taurus and
Crown Victorias sold in north America. Traditionally, the north American and
European operations of the world's second-largest vehicle maker have
operated as independent fiefdoms, guarding the right to design, develop and
manufacture for their markets.
Below the top management level there has been an ingrained scepticism and
mistrust towards product ideas emanating from the other continent. The
Mondeo is supposed to break the mould.
For Ford of Europe the launch comes as the company battles against two years
of heavy losses and declining market share. It is cutting more than 10,000
jobs or 11 per cent of its workforce across its European operations. Largely
developed at Ford's European R&amp;D centres in Germany and in the UK, the
Mondeo is set to replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in
March, and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in north America, where it will be
launched in 1994.
Sales of the 11-year-old Sierra have been falling in the past two years.
Ford urgently needs a new product in the large family car market, which
accounts for about 20 per cent of the total west European new car market.
Competition in the segment is becoming intense, however. The Sierra has been
sidelined by more powerful rivals, General Motors' Opel Vectra/Vauxhall
Cavalier and Volkswagen's Passat. This is the market targeted by Japanese
carmakers for their first European-built cars, the Nissan Primera, Honda
Accord and Toyota Carina, now in production in the UK.
For Ford, the significance of the Mondeo project goes well beyond Europe. It
has reformed its engineering and manufacturing infrastructure in America and
Europe to break down entrenched barriers between the two, as it has set out
to develop a mainstream car acceptable in both markets. The Mondeo will be
assembled at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium - volume production started this
week - and at Kansas City in the US.
The same family of four-cylinder engines will be made at plants in Bridgend
in the UK and at Cologne in Germany for Europe, and at Chihuahua in Mexico
for north America. A top-of-the-range aluminium V6 engine will be made at
Cleveland, Ohio, for both the US and European-produced cars. Manual
transmissions will be made in Europe at Halewood, Merseyside, in the UK and
at Cologne, while an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic gearbox
will be made in the US. After a global search, common component producers
have been chosen to supply both the European and north American assembly
plants.
Ford's top management has long been tantalised by the holy grail of the
so-called world car, and by the savings that should be achieved by
developing a product once for both manufacture and sale in different
continents. It has tried before to develop a world car, but the Ford Escorts
launched at the beginning of the 1980s in Europe and north America ended up
with little more in common than the name and the blue Ford oval badge on the
bonnet.
Mr Philip Benton, Ford president until he retired at the end of December,
was one of the company's most outspoken champions of 'global car'
development. He claims that the Mondeo is 'writing a new chapter' in Ford's
world-car story, incorporating many lessons from the troubled Escort
programme, where the company set up two distinct product development teams,
one on each side of the Atlantic. 'When there were opportunities to deviate
from the shared engineering plan, both teams made the most of them,
protecting their own turf and defending their own ideas about what
constituted the 'right' product,' says Mr Benton.
For Mondeo, Ford has developed a global technical communications system to
gather critical engineering information and to distribute it to the group's
design and manufacturing engineers in a common language. Eventually the
network is supposed to unite 20,000 engineers in north and south America,
Europe, Australia and the Far East.
Ford claims that the most immediate advantage from a global programme like
Mondeo is in direct development and investment costs. 'A global company can
concentrate its resources where they will be used most efficiently,' says Mr
Benton. He says there is also an 'enormous' potential for improvement in
quality, and product options such as engine size can be simplified.
A global car programme also offers greater cost-effectiveness through the
worldwide sourcing of components, both from inside Ford and from outside
suppliers, Mr Benton adds. For the Mondeo programme alone Ford will be
spending Dollars 2.5bn a year on components bought from outside suppliers.
According to Mr Albert Caspers, Ford of Europe's director of manufacturing,
the share taken by north American suppliers of the European-built Mondeo has
jumped to 15 per cent from only 1 per cent to 2 per cent in Ford of Europe's
traditional programmes. 'We have also brought many European suppliers to
north America and some have made joint ventures in the US,' he says. 'The
philosophy was to develop a part only once from one supplier for the world.
This is the first project where we have done this. And we began to source
parts up to four years before the first car was due to be produced. That is
a radical departure.'
Ford estimates that about Dollars 140m worth of components will be exported
annually to north America from Europe with about Dollars 260m worth of
components coming from north America to Europe as part of the Mondeo
programme. Mr Caspers claims that the company has more than halved its
traditional number of suppliers to only 200 component makers, supplying
about 80 per cent by value of Mondeo parts and systems. 'We are also going
more than ever before to just-in-time delivery,' says Mr Caspers. About 14
suppliers have set up production within a 30km radius of the Genk plant to
ensure simultaneous delivery of parts to the assembly line with no stock
held in the car plant.
As Ford of Europe seeks to regain profitability, the Mondeo programme also
offers significant productivity gains in the assembly process. For the first
time at any of its European assembly plants Ford is moving to three-shift,
round-the-clock working at Genk, enabling it to catch up with the precedent
set by General Motors at the end of the 1980s. Production capacity for the
Mondeo at Genk has been increased to 1,970 a day or 400,000 a year, compared
with a maximum of 1,500 a day for the Sierra. The Kansas City plant will
initially have a capacity to produce 250,000 a year.
If the Mondeo gamble pays off, Ford will have taken a big step towards
closing the gap in cost and efficiency on its Japanese rivals. At six years,
the development programme was still too long by the best world standards,
but few vehicle projects have been so complex, and Ford has since lowered
its target for current projects to four years.
The programme has pioneered significant changes in Ford's engineering
organisation. It has introduced new methods of design for easier
manufacture, adopted more rigorously simultaneous engineering techniques and
formed new long-term R&amp;D relationships with Ford's leading suppliers.
After the Escort fiasco, the company appears to have crossed big hurdles
towards building an organisation capable of achieving a world car. The
question is whether world markets and consumer tastes will converge to allow
Ford to reap future cost benefits based on lessons learnt with Mondeo. Ford
will need to repeat this trick in other segments of the global car market.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UB buys into US own-label biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Biscuits, the biscuits and snacks group, is moving into the US
own-label cookie market through the acquisition of Bake-Line, a private
company. UB is paying Dollars 70m (Pounds 47m) and taking on Dollars 5m of
debt.
Sir Robert Clarke, UB chairman, said the purchase would not dilute UB's
earnings in the short term and there would be merger benefits further out.
Bake-Line should strengthen the position of Keebler, UB's branded cookie,
cracker and snack subsidiary in the US. Keebler suffered a sharp drop in
profits - from Pounds 29.7m to Pounds 12.1m in the first six months of 1992
 -because it met difficult trading conditions as consumers switched to
cheaper, often own-label, cookies.
Keebler had not moved into the own-label sector although this area has been
growing rapidly in the US in recent years, following a similar trend in the
UK. In Britain, UB, which has the McVitie's brand, is also the leading
own-label biscuit producer and makes the same margins on branded and
own-label biscuits.
Own-label now accounts for nearly 14 per cent of the US cookie market by
volume. Bake-Line has a 25 per cent share of the own-label sector.
Bake-Line, based in Chicago, has a modern factory with 40 per cent spare
capacity. Benefits should come from joint purchasing, distribution,
technology and the use Keebler can make of Bake-Line's spare capacity. A
longer term aim is to move into the own-label cracker market.
The purchase price compares with Bake-Line's net assets of Dollars 17m,
sales in the year to June 27 of Dollars 73.8m and trading profits of Dollars
5.2m. Bake-Line's profits are expected to be substantially higher in the
current year.
However, stockbrokers expressed concern about the effect of the deal on UB's
balance sheet, coming after the Pounds 200m acquisition of CCA Snacks in
Australia, which was completed on Monday. Sir Robert said that gearing,
excluding brands from the balance sheet, would be 88 per cent after the
deal.
He said UB had no plans to issue shares - a Pounds 80m placing of shares
helped finance the CCA deal - but added that it could make disposals. He
said interest cover would be 4.9 times after the Bake-Line acquisition.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices fall further as Opec
oversupply goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER fall in European oil prices yesterday underlined the tenuousness
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' hold on the market.
Brent crude for February delivery dropped 22.5 cents to Dollars 17.75 a
barrel. This followed a fall of similar proportions the day before.
In the US, where prices fell sharply on Monday, they were steadier
yesterday. In late trading the New York Mercantile Exchange's light crude
contract for March delivery was quoted at Dollars 19.18 a barrel, up 2 cents
from Monday's closing level.
Analysts said that the continuing high level of Opec production was
undermining market sentiment. Members of the producer cartel are between
them producing at 600,000-800,000 barrels a day above the 24.58m b/d ceiling
they agreed at their latest meeting in Vienna in November.
In particular, Saudi Arabia is determined to hold on to its market share, in
spite of the pressures created by Kuwait's rapid return to full production.
The Saudis are reported to have cut prices for February delivery earlier
this week, adding further downward pressure to the market.
Against this background, the unseasonally warm weather prevailing on the US
east coast has cut fuel demand. A sharp fall in heating oil prices on Monday
was the major factor behind the weakness of the US market. Earlier forecasts
of an exceptionally cold winter had encouraged dealers to lay in large
stocks.
Although the prospects are strengthening for an economic recovery, traders
doubt that these will provide a fillip to prices because of the high level
of stocks.
'The market needs colder weather, production cutbacks and cuts in crude
runs,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, an analyst at ED &amp; F. Man in New York. 'But it
will only get cuts in crude runs.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: News Corp shares
fall as Fox TV chief quits

Correction (published 8th January 1993) appended to this article.
SHARES in News Corporation tumbled Dollars 2 1/2 , or about 6 per cent, to
Dollars 37 7/8 in heavy trading in New York yesterday following the
unexpected resignation of Mr Jamie Kellner as president and chief operating
officer of the company's Fox Broadcasting television unit.
Although Fox moved quickly to calm investors by yesterday naming Ms Lucille
Salhany as Mr Kellner's replacement, the market was unsettled by Mr
Kellner's resignation, the latest in a series of high-level departures at
Fox.
In the past year, Fox has lost Mr Barry Diller, creator of the Fox network,
Mr Joe Roth, chairman of the 20th Century Fox studio, and Mr Peter Chernin,
president of Fox's network entertainment division.
Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, said: 'Jamie's leaving
is a negative because every senior executive has changed in the last 12
months. But Lucie is the absolute best person for that spot. Fox could not
have picked a better person.'
Ms Salhany, who was named Fox Broadcasting chairman, was previously chairman
of Fox's 20th Century Television.
Mr Kellner, 45, had been at Fox since its birth in 1985 and is credited with
helping to mastermind Fox's meteoric rise into the fourth-biggest US
network.
'When Fox Broadcasting first began it was a question mark in everybody's
mind,' he said.
'While there are still challenges ahead for the company, there is now no
question that the Fox network is here to stay.'
Mr Kellner said he would pursue other business opportunities but would
remain associated with the company as a board member.
Fox's television and film businesses contribute about 25 per cent of News
Corp's operating income.
Mr Kellner stressed that he was leaving Fox on friendly terms.
CORRECTION
Mr Peter Chernin moved from Fox Entertainment to replace Mr Joe Roth as head
of the 20th Century Fox. He did not leave the Fox group, as stated in later
editions of the FT on January 6.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian diamond samples
disappoint

SHARES OF companies involved in the diamond stampede in Canada's Northwest
Territories tumbled yesterday after a group of major players announced that
eight drilling targets have yielded only three tiny stones.
Aber Resources, Commonwealth Gold and SouthernEra Resources described the
results from their joint venture properties in the Lac de Gras area as
'encouraging.' They noted that micro-diamonds have been found in three of
seven kimberlite deposits and that 30 targets remain to be tested.
But SouthernEra's share price fell 70 cents on the Toronto stock exchange
yesterday morning to CDollars 4.10. Dia Met Minerals, whose discoveries
triggered the Northwest Territories' diamond rush last year, lost CDollars
1.50 on the Vancouver stock exchange to CDollars 37.50.
Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, said the latest
drilling results were 'clearly disappointing' and bore no comparison to Dia
Met's encouraging gem diamond discoveries. He noted however, that the
results were unlikely to quell the enthusiasm of companies that had flocked
to the remote Canadian Arctic in an exploration frenzy rivalling any in
North American mining history.
Exploration work is continuing at a feverish pace with international mining
groups such as De Beers and Teck Corporation continuing to stake new claims.
De Beers has declined to disclose the results of its work. Mr Lee Barker,
vice-president at SouthernEra, said he had been told that one of two targets
drilled by the South African group drilled last autumn intersected a
kimberlite pipe.
Mr Barker put a brave face on Aber and SouthernEra's latest results. He
said: 'We've proven that the cluster has the potential to host some
diamonds. I'm as bullish about this as I was a year ago.' The Aber group
plans to resume drilling in the spring.
Mr Hainey said that surface samples obtained recently by two other
companies, Pure Gold and Lytton Minerals, had also been encouraging.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: German banks ruling criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S public sector banks are getting 'free' capital worth DM10bn,
(Dollars 6.2bn) giving them significant competitive advantages over private
sector institutions, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, the association of
private sector German banks, complained yesterday.
The complaint follows the German banking authorities' decision to allow
Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and other public sector banks to
consolidate their housing finance subsidiaries. This decision should be
investigated by the European Commission, the association urged.
The Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Kreditwesen - the supervisory body for the
banking sector - ruled last week that public sector banks should be able to
treat the capital locked up in housing finance subsidiaries as core equity
capital under tough new European Community-wide capital adequacy rules which
took effect at the beginning of the year.
Private sector banks have had to hold expensive rights issues to meet the
rules and are bitter at what they see as the unfair advantage given to
public sector competitors.
The association singled out WestLB, the acquisitive Dusselfdorf-based public
sector bank, for special criticism as its capital would be bolstered by
DM4bn as a result of the ruling. The ruling allows WestLB, the strongest
public sector bank in Germany, to consolidate the assets acquired on the
acquisition of WFA, the housing finance subsidiary for the state of
North-Rhine Westphalia acquired in 1991.
WestLB is controversial in Germany as a result of its aggressive approach to
industrial investments and its determination to take the lead in the
restructuring of the public banking sector. Critics fear that access to the
new capital will allow chief executive Mr Friedel Neuber to pursue a more
aggressive policy.
On Monday, WestLB said it had increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel
business to 86 per cent from 10 per cent, in spite of investigations by the
Berlin cartel office into its mounting influence over the German travel
industry. WestLB said that its holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary
would be combined with other travel interests in a new wholly-owned
subsidiary, TCT Touristik Beteiligungs.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Laporte emerges as Evode's white knight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the UK's second largest quoted chemicals group, yesterday emerged
as a potential white knight for Evode, the chemicals and plastics group,
fighting off a hostile bid from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate.
Evode is in an advanced stage of discussions with Laporte, which is close to
making a recommended bid above Pounds 1 a share.
The news took Wassall by surprise. It had just announced its final offer of
95.2p a share.
Wassall's cash and share offer values Evode's ordinary and convertible
preference shares at Pounds 113.2m. It is also offering a cash alternative
valuing Evode's shares at 92p, compared with an original offer of 80p.
By last night Laporte had spent Pounds 4.45m buying 6.1 per cent of Evode at
Pounds 1 a share.
Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive, said: 'The worst thing for the UK
chemical industry is for it to be carved up like a dead rabbit. Evode
requires a combination of chemical expertise and the right management which
we are offering.'
After tracking Evode for seven years he said he recently concluded that two
companies would make an 'excellent fit' and started serious negotiations
about making a recommended bid for Evode before Christmas.
Laporte's expected bid would include a mixture of equity and cash aimed at
ensuring that Laporte's resultant gearing was not much above 50 per cent.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said: 'Evode will continue to defend the
company vigorously against any inadequate offers, into which category
Wassall's final offer firmly falls.' He declined to comment on the talks
with Laporte.
Wassall has asked Evode for any new information it might have given to
Laporte. Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said he was determined
not to overpay for Evode. 'We have walked away from private deals in the
past because the price was too expensive.'
Wassall updated its forecast for pre-tax profits for the year ended December
31, 1992, saying it would now make Pounds 17.5m for the full year.
It recently received more than Pounds 50m of its rights issue which it could
use on other deals if it fails to get Evode.

TWO MOVES were announced yesterday to fill the gap created by the closure on
Monday of the Dover-Boulogne ferry service operated by P&amp;O European Ferries.
The French company Opale Ferries, which operates a freight-only service
between Boulogne and Folkestone, indicated that it was likely to add a
second ship to the route in the near future because it was close to capacity
even before P&amp;O's withdrawal.
Boulogne's Chamber of Commerce said it was seeking shipping companies
prepared to invest in the passenger route.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Storms thwart clean-up strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHETLAND Islands Council yesterday activated its contingency plans to deal
with a Braer-type disaster but was thwarted by severe storms.
The storms may help the clean-up operation by breaking up the oil in high
waves - the Braer's cargo is a light crude which is easily dispersed. Mr Ian
White, managing director of the International Tanker Owners Pollution
Federation, estimated that up to 70 per cent of the oil would evaporate or
disperse naturally.
He said the severe weather rendered conventional methods of dealing with oil
pollution useless.
Aircraft were unable to spray chemicals and neither booms nor skimmers
stored on the island could be deployed.
He said the spill could not be compared with the Exxon Valdez disaster in
1989. In that spill, in Alaska, the oil was congregated in relatively still
water.
The Marine Pollution Control Centre at the Department of Transport, which
tackles pollution at sea, sent up six aircraft yesterday to track the slick
and spray dispersant, but all the aircraft were forced back by the weather.
One of the organisation's remote sensing aircraft, which has radar and
infra-red equipment to track an oil slick, managed to reach the shipwreck
but had to return because of the storm-force winds.
The aircraft were waiting in Inverness to try to reach the scene at first
light this morning.
Mr Michael Hudner, chief executive of Bermuda-based Bergvall &amp; Hudner Ship
Management, which operates the tanker for its Liberian owners, was due to
reach Shetland last night with a response team to co-ordinate the salvage
operation. He said yesterday: 'We regret this incident occurred.'
Smit Tak International, a leading ocean salvage company based in Rotterdam,
was awarded the contract for the salvage operation. The company's payment is
tied to the amount of environmental pollution it can contain.
The company said last night that the first aim would be to board the vessel
to assess the situation, but that has been impossible so far because of the
high winds.
The company is hoping it can pump the oil from the damaged tanker with
equipment aboard a salvage vessel on its way from Rotterdam.
Smit Tak will have two teams of six salvage experts in Shetland by this
morning with three vessels - one locally contracted salvage ship and two
from Rotterdam.

The railcars, to be made in Belgium, will be delivered from 1995 to the year
2000. GEC Alsthom will be responsible for all electrical and electronic
equipment and the motor bogies. The units will be equipped with the latest
technology, including computerised control. Some units will have
dual-voltage equipment allowing them to cross the Belgian-French border.
The order brings the value of work won by GEC Alsthom consortia from
European rail networks over the past three months to Pounds 2bn, including
options.

TELEVISA, Mexico's largest media group, has bought 50 per cent of PanAmSat
LP, the privately-owned US satellite company, for Dollars 200m. The deal has
received approval from the US Federal Communications Commission.
PanAmSat operates one satellite for broadcasting over the Atlantic region.
However, it plans to put into orbit another three covering the Atlantic,
Pacific and Indian oceans before 1996 which would make it the world's only
private global satellite communications network.
The purchase fits in with Televisa's strategy of becoming a global,
vertically integrated media company. Televisa is a large producer of
television programmes, and will now have full control of their distribution
across the world.
The acquisition will free it from Mexican government regulations on
satellite broadcasting.
The purchase is not expected to affect Televisa's earnings until 1996.

CONTROL of the world's largest ice hockey equipment manufacturer, Karhu
Canada, of Montreal, has moved from Finland to the US, writes Robert Gibbens
in Montreal.
A US investor group, led by New York investment bankers Mancuso, is buying
84 per cent of Karhu from Asko Holdings of Finland for CDollars 108m
(USDollars 90m).
Karhu's hockey sticks are used by half the National Hockey League players in
North America. The company recorded sales of around CDollars 110m and
employs 600 in North America and Europe.
The new owners will inject capital into Karhu with the aim of increasing
market share in the US and entering eastern Europe, said Mr Douglas Barbor,
president. Mr Barbor founded Karhu in 1976 and Asko bought control in 1981.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: WestLB raises Thomas Cook stake
to 86%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the acquisitive Dusseldorf-based public-sector
bank, has increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business from 10 per
cent to 86 per cent.
Despite investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting
influence over the booming German travel industry, WestLB said yesterday its
holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary was to be combined with other
travel and tourism interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik
Beteiligungs.
These include a 17 per cent stake in the Walter Kahn Verwaltungs group,
which in turn holds 30 per cent of the equity in TUI, Europe's biggest
travel agent. According to WestLB calculations, the bank's interest in Kahn
gives it a 5 per cent share in TUI.
The deal appears to mark the end of a complex process which started in June
last year when LTU, the charter flight and holidays company of which WestLB
owns 34 per cent, agreed to buy 90 per cent of Thomas Cook from the Midland
Bank. WestLB simultaneously took an option on the remainder of the stock.
The sale was concluded in September, when the purchasers paid Midland Pounds
200m plus an undisclosed proportion of Thomas Cook's 1992 profits.
As WestLB explained yesterday, LTU is left with 14 per cent in the once
British group.
Meanwhile, the bank, which has built a similarly complicated web of holdings
and cross-holdings in many industries, remains under close scrutiny by the
federal cartel authorities which are concerned over its growing power in the
travel business.
They are examining its interests in Horten, a retailing group, which has a
50 per cent share in another travel-oriented holding company, HS Touristik
Beteiligungs, with a further 25 per cent in TUI.
Although WestLB holds only 25 per cent of Horten directly, the cartel office
claims it has an indirect majority share.
The authorities recently won a temporary injunction banning Horten from
exercising its voting rights at TUI meetings. A full court hearing has been
scheduled for January 11.

THE French government said yesterday it did not plan to suspend Japanese car
imports, writes William Dawkins from Paris.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and trade minister, said France believed
in the EC-Japan car import accord signed in July 1991, which had been 'more
than respected' by Japanese car exporters to France.

FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP hurt by US selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVIVAL OF long-running market stories that British Petroleum could be about
to launch a massive rights issue, together with several other bearish tales,
left BP shares floundering.
However, BP dismissed suggestions of an impending fund-raising exercise. Oil
analysts agreed, arguing that, although the company might announce a rights
issue later in the year, a cash call now is unlikely. 'BP will not be forced
into issuing shares too cheaply, that is for certain,' said one broker. The
stock closed 9 1/2 down at 236 1/2 p on 9.7m traded.
Dealers said the weakness in BP developed just before US markets opened with
US brokers big sellers. US investors have been strong supporters of BP since
the middle of last year and now speak for around 21 per cent of the equity.
CJ Lawrence, one of the most influential US brokers in the oil sector and a
long-time bull of BP, was said to have turned a seller.
The latest slide in oil prices to below Dollars 18 a barrel, a weak dollar
and a story in the US press about US opposition to the sale of a BP
chemicals plant to Iran, brought additional pressure. Another suggestion was
that the apparently keen support for the shares last month might have
represented no more than end-year 'window dressing'. Strauss Turnbull,
long-time bears of BP, reaffirmed its downside target of 170p. 'Switch into
Shell,' said Mr John Toalster.
ICI stands out
Support from James Capel, the leading UK agency broker, ensured that ICI
stood out in a weakened FT-SE Index yesterday. The shares rallied 15 to
1085p in spite of negative comment from a rival house and falls in a number
of internationally traded stocks.
Mr David Ingles, Capel's chemicals analyst, raised his recommendation on ICI
to a buy from a strong hold. He has maintained his 1993 profits forecast at
Pounds 800m, around the top end of expectations, and is 'conscious that the
news from the company will be bad'. But he argues that most of that bad news
is already in the share price and there is little downside from present
levels.
He has the support of Nikko Europe, which is a buyer of ICI for its recovery
prospects. However, County NatWest issued a sell note and cut its 1993
forecast by 21 per cent to Pounds 600m. County believes weak demand in
mainland Europe, particularly Germany, is maintaining heavy pressure on the
group's materials and industrial chemicals businesses.
Redland firm
The market continued to register approval of the asset sales announced by
Redland on Monday, the shares outpacing both the building sector and the
overall market.
At the close, the stock was 10 higher at 433p, making a two-day advance of
26. Turnover was heavy, with 3.4m shares dealt.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss-owned stockbroker, was said to have been one
of the strongest supporters of the shares. Mr David Taylor, building analyst
at UBS, labelled the shares a buy because of growing confidence that the
1993 dividend would be paid. 'There are not many Footsie stocks offering an
8 per cent yield with the dividend likely to be maintained,' he added.
Redland's preliminary figures are expected in April.
Good pre-Christmas trading at Marks and Spencer helped the shares put on 8
to 333p. In briefings to analysts, the stores group said that second-half
sales were ahead of expectations, although no specific figures were given.
However, some in the market had feared that sales, and more crucially
margins, might have fallen in this period and had been ready to downgrade.
Turnover was a healthy 13m.
Positive sales figures from Circuit City, leading electrical retailer in the
US, sent Dixons sharply forward, raising hopes that Silo, its US subsidiary
and Circuit City rival, may return to profitability. Dixons shares closed 10
up at 274p. Boots tumbled on profit-taking after rising last week on US
approval for its Manoplax drug. The shares fell 14 to 545p.
Abbey National attracted selling pressure after hints of a profits
downgrade, the shares closing 11 off at 381p on turnover of 5.6m. Concern
about yet more provisions against property losses left Barclays 3 off at
386p. But Standard Chartered responded to a broker buy recommendation,
improving 15 to 603p, the highest since February 1990.
Extremely active markets and the prospect of a bumper year for rights issues
and takeover bids gave a boost to some merchant banks. Hambros appreciated
12 to 261p and Kleinwort Benson 7 to 329p.
Insurance brokers Sedgwick advanced 5 to 182p and Willis Corroon 9 to 201p,
reflecting the Kleinwort Benson buy recommendations.
Dollar-influenced stocks were generally affected by weakness in the US
currency, as well as the sidelining of defensive stocks. Glaxo was the main
casualty, with Lehman Brothers becoming the latest US house to point out the
stock's premium to its growth rate. Lehman was advising clients to switch
into companies such as Astra, Roche and Wellcome.
Glaxo fell 35 to 764p, accounting for more than seven points of the slide in
the Footsie. Wellcome improved 3 to 982p. Other internationals to suffer
included BAT, Rothmans International and RTZ.
Rights issue talk surrounded food manufacturer Unilever, although analysts
were sceptical, choosing to blame a large seller in Amsterdam for the fall
of 24 in the shares to 1093p.
United Biscuits spent Dollars 75m strengthening its US biscuit arm with the
purchase of Bake Line. UB added 2 at 364p.
A busy food retail sector shrugged off last week's price war worries as
strong seasonal sales talk continued to be heard. J. Sainsbury moved 3 ahead
to 577p, bolstered by upgradings from BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Rumours
that discount specialist Kwik Save would announce Christmas sales growth of
13 per cent helped the shares gain 8 at 786p. Tesco, expected to announce
similar news, firmed 2 to 258p.
Hoare Govett was positive on Iceland Frozen Foods and the shares rose 13 to
636p, but Hoare's downgrade of Morrison Supermarkets led to a fall of 6 to
161p in the shares.
There was no dimming of takeover speculation around Owners Abroad, which put
on 1 1/2 at 109p in turnover of 3.5m, with rival tour operator Airtours
still favourite to make a 120p-a-share bid. Airtours edged forward a penny
to 321p.
Thorn EMI fell 21 to 860p. Smith New Court decided the stock had overrun and
advised clients to take profits.
The SG Warburg media team sent out a review of the publishers which advised
clients to remain overweight in the sector. The house likes Carlton
Communications, which gained 5 at 783p. Among the second liners, Warburg
advised picking up Daily Mail, Emap and Trinity.
Newspaper group Ports-mouth &amp; Sunderland climbed 15 to 565p following a
substantial buy order from an institutional client carried out by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
Bank note printer De La Rue languished 12 lower at 645p after SG Warburg
Securities reviewed the paper and packaging sector. The house believes that
the stock is expensive in the short term. It feels the choice buys are
Bunzl, a penny firmer at 122p, and Bowater, steady at 480p.
Powell Duffryn rose 18 to 484p after the company announced a Pounds 3.5m
acquisition.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte fell 20 to 629p on fears that its
declared interest in adhesives group Evode might prompt some form of
fund-raising exercise. Laporte said it intended to pick up 10 per cent of
Evode shortly after conglomerate Wassall increased its offer to 95p a share.
Wassall fell 10 to 207p and Evode firmed a penny to 104p.
Index buying helped textile group Campari International recover 11 to 270p.

FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DAY split into two distinct halves saw the futures market reach a new
all-time high only to end the day in ignominious retreat, writes Christopher
Price.
The opening of trading on the March FT-SE future contract was dominated by
hopes of a cut in German interest rates at the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow.
March, which opened at 2,882, moved smartly forward on the speculation,
which raised hopes for a further easing of UK rates.
Strong short sterling and firm gilts also combined to squeeze March higher
through a busy morning period, before the contract reached an historical
high of 2,898 around midday.
However, the mood changed for the afternoon when the European interest rate
markets weakened and the German rate cut hopes diminished. A leading US
house led the way, selling the future down, helped by rumours of a large
rights issue from BP.
By late afternoon, March had dropped to 2,850, its low of the day, before
rallying at the close to finish at 2,856, a 10-point premium to its fair
value of around 15. Volume was a credible 9,549 contracts.
Volume was also healthy in the options market, where 33,322 contracts were
traded, of which the FT-SE 100 contract was responsible for 9,339 lots.
Marks and Spencer was the top traded stock option at 1,332, followed by Blue
Circle at 1,324.

FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking hits the FT-SE leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR fund managers yesterday took a closer look at the generous valuation
levels built up on the UK stock market over Christmas and decided the time
had come to take profits. They first showed their hands in the stock index
sector and a heavy fall in the March contract on the FT-SE Index soon
accelerated the setback in the underlying equities.
An early gain of 7.8, taking the Footsie to a new trading peak of 2,869.3,
was rapidly replaced by a loss which ranged to more than 31 points at the
day's low. The final reading of 2,833.6 left the index down 27.9 on the
session.
Profit-taking focused on the leading stocks, and the second tier issues were
slow to react to the change in market sentiment. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
closed 13.8 up at a new peak of 2,910.2, but the day's gain had been halved
by the end of the session.
The diversion between the two indices appeared to reflect separate pressures
from domestic and international factors. In the UK, early reports on
consumer spending over Christmas have been favourable, and received further
encouragement yesterday from Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer.
Darker clouds, however, have appeared overseas, where hopes that this week's
pressures on the French franc might spur a cut in German interest rates must
await tomorrow's meeting at the Bundesbank.
However, the London stock market had been bracing itself for a correction
after its powerful advance during the Christmas period. UK equities, and in
particular the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, were perceived as 'overbought on almost
any technical criteria', said Mr Richard Kersley at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
the UK investment bank.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull also saw UK share valuations of around 17
times historic earnings as expensive against other global markets, and
pointed out that problems facing UK equities could include tax increases in
the chancellor's March budget.
Determined selling of the March Footsie future set the pace for the fall in
share prices, but the blaze was fanned by a revival of the rights issue
worries already in the market before Christmas. Traders refused to be
impressed by suggestions that Unilever or some other blue chip planned a
rights issue, but believed a smaller name might attempt a fund-raising.
Losses across the range of the blue chip issues were emphasised by weakness
in dollar stocks, behind the US currency. A sharp rise in Seaq-reported
trading volume to 769.1m shares from Monday's 606.6m indicated a return to
more normal trading levels. More significantly, Stock Exchange data showed
that Monday's retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.01bn.
Equity volume has remained relatively high over the holiday period and now
appears to be establishing itself at the Pounds 1bn-plus daily levels
recorded since sterling's withdrawal from the ERM network.
Strategists suggested that, in the near term, the direction of the stock
market is likely to be driven by developments in stock index futures, the
instrument often used by fund managers to change an underlying stance in
equities. Share prices are expected to open cautiously this morning and to
await their cue from the futures.

FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trapped in narrow range
before jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices remained trapped in a narrow range yesterday as investors
cautiously awaited Friday's key December jobs report, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 1.35 at
3,307.87. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.04 easier at
434.34. The Nasdaq composite, however, rebounded from recent losses to add
2.54 at 674.34. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 241m shares,
while overall rises held a modest advantage over declines by 1,071 to 799.
For the second day, the market traded without a clear direction as investors
struggled to find an incentive to buy stocks.
Although underlying sentiment remained positive - economic growth and
corporate earnings are both forecast to improve this year - market
participants were nervous that expectations of a new year rally had become
overblown, and that disappointment about the failure of the market to post a
strong advance could trigger a sell-off in coming days.
The absence of fresh economic data was also a factor, as was investors'
wariness about committing large sums of money ahead of Friday's important
employment report for December. Analysts are expecting the report to show a
rise of about 80,000 in non-farm payrolls, and for the national unemployment
rate to have held at 7.2 per cent.
Philip Morris dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 73 1/2 in volume of 5.1m
shares and American Brands lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39 following reports
that Governor Mario Cuomo of New York was considering doubling the state tax
on cigarettes.
IBM once again came under selling pressure, weakening Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 48 7/8 in volume of 3.5m shares, as the share price continued to
reflect concern that the dividend payment may be under threat because of the
computer group's financial difficulties.
The ADRs in News Corporation fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 37 7/8 in busy
trading on news that Mr Jamie Kellner, the president of the company's Fox
Broadcasting unit, had resigned. Mr Kellner is the fourth member of Fox's
senior management to leave the company in recent months.
Chubb retreated Dollars 2 to Dollars 86 after Mr Ronald Frank, an analyst at
broking house Smith Barney, downgraded the stock and issued a general
warning about property and casualty shares, which he believed have probably
peaked in the short term. Other stocks affected were AIG, down Dollars 3 3/8
at Dollars 112 3/4 , General Re, Dollars 2 7/8 lower at Dollars 112 7/8 ,
and Continental Corp, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 26 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, Monday's declining technology stocks rallied strongly.
Intel appreciated Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 91, Oracle Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 29 3/8 and Sun Microsystems Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 36 3/8 .
Canada
THE TORONTO market finished modestly firmer, bolstered by a rally in
Canada's heavily weighted gold shares after bullion prices staged a recovery
from Monday's slide to a seven-year low.
The TSE 300 index improved 2.4 points to 3,353.4 as the gold shares index
picked up 8.8 to 5,162. Advances led falls by 294 to 288 after heavy volume
of 41m shares, up from Monday's 30.9m. Turnover value rose to CDollars
342.6m from CDollars 233.2m.

FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities welcome political
calm - But foreign investors are likely to be more circumspect in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil closed 1992 with a new president and a rise in share prices. But most
traders are circumspect about predicting a return to the boom of late 1991
and early 1992, partly because foreigners are likely to be much more
cautious this time around.
Large single day upswings were sandwiched around the Christmas holiday: the
Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index gained 13.3 per cent on December 23
and 13.0 per cent on December 27 in turnover of about Dollars 100m a day.
That movement was partly a reaction to a government decision to allow real
price increases for Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications holding
company that accounts for one-third of the index and generates about half of
the market's daily trading volume.
The upsurge also anticipated the removal from office of the president, Mr
Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned on December 29, just as his
impeachment trial on corruption charges was about to begin in the senate.
Having expected Mr Collor's demise, the Bovespa declined 1.4 per cent on the
day he stood down.
The year-end rally greatly improved the monthly figures for the Bovespa, but
was modest compared to the expectations held during the heady days before
May when the political corruption scandal involving Mr Collor first came to
light.
In spite of a December jump of 19.2 per cent in dollar terms, the Bovespa
closed the year showing a loss of 3.6 per cent, measured in the US currency.
By contrast, during the first four months of 1992 the index had outdistanced
the dollar by 65.7 per cent.
Traders seem content, if not completely satisfied, with the early policy
statements of President Itamar Franco and Mr Paulo Haddad, the plan-ning
minister. Official dec-larations have indicated a willingness to pursue
economic reform and fiscal adjustment, with greater concern for social
policy, even if they have been short on details.
Investors have been encouraged by the new administration's repeated promises
to eschew disruptive heterodox economic 'shock' programmes akin to those
periodically imposed by Mr Collor and his predecessor, Mr Jose Sarney.
To some extent, the market has lapsed into a mildly optimistic
'wait-and-see' attitude. Last Wednesday, when Mr Franco presented his
economic policy to the nation, the Bovespa index rose 2.1 per cent, while on
Monday, the first trading session after Mr Haddad had given details of some
of the proposals, it put on a further 5.4 per cent.
Yesterday the Bovespa jumped 5,766 points, or 8 per cent, to end at 77,238
in heavy turnover of Cr1.54 trillion (Dollars 123m), well above the average
of the last few weeks.
'I do not think we have seen any reaction yet to the macro policy
statements,' says Mr George Rexing, director and head of foreign banking
services for Banco de Boston, the local subsidiary of First National Bank of
Boston. 'That reaction will come from foreigners.'
It was foreign capital that was primarily responsible for the market's surge
in late 1991 and early 1992 following the decision in mid-1991 to allow
overseas institutions to operate directly in Brazilian bourses. During the
first four months of 1992, foreigners funnelled nearly Dollars 1bn in net
investment into equities. But this tailed off during the rest of the year,
so that by the end of November, figures for all foreign capital market
investment in Brazil showed a net inflow of just Dollars 1.9bn.
Telebras, by far Bovespa's most heavily traded stock, closed 1992 at Dollars
17.73 for a 1,000-share lot, down from a high of Dollars 36.29 in April. It
recovered steadily after the government announced that it would permit real
increases in telecommunications fees, reversing initial indications from Mr
Franco that public utility prices would be held down to fight inflation and
make services more accessible to Brazil's poor majority. Telebras should
continue to dominate trading in 1993, reflecting its liquidity and low
price.
Nevertheless, other publicly owned utilities began to attract interest after
the administration's decision to allow real increases in tariffs.

FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firm dollar helps to lift
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A HIGHER dollar helped to lift several bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT's buyers found empty books and small-lot buyers of blue chips like
Allianz, up DM39 to DM2,004, faced exaggerated share price mark-ups which
left the DAX index 25.09, or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,556.42.
Turnover rose from DM2.3bn to DM4.1bn. Most of the big rises came in
carmakers, retailers and steels, which had fallen on depressing news before
Christmas. Volkswagen rose DM9.40 to DM251.90, Kaufhof by DM11 to DM423 and
Thyssen by DM6 to DM164.50.
Some analysts were worried by the renewed interest rate speculation, since a
forced interest rate cut by the Bundesbank might well be accompanied by a
realignment of the franc to the further disadvantage of German industry.
PARIS shrugged off early weakness, caused by a sharp rise in overnight rates
to protect the franc. The CAC-40 index hit an early low of 1,831.07 but
recovered to close up 7.70 at 1,850.78, just off the day's high of 1,853.26,
in good turnover of FFr1.9bn.
Rhone-Poulenc CI's jumped FFr23 or 4.4 per cent to FFr541 after the finance
minister Mr Michel Sapin was reported as saying that shares in the
state-owned chemicals company would not be sold off cheaply in the
forthcoming partial privatisation.
Peugeot was another gainer, up FFr15 to FFr593, on news that its new car
sales in France rose 25.7 per cent in December from the same month in 1991
and on better-than-expected car matriculation data for 1992.
MILAN rose in surprisingly active trading before today's holiday. Traders
were excited by the news that the interministerial price committee had
recommended the convertibility of savings shares into ordinary shares in
public companies earmarked for privatisation, although the proposed ratio
was not known. The Comit index rose 0.86 to 453.72 in turnover estimated at
L150bn-L180bn after Monday's L143.7bn.
Credito Italiano, which is expected to be sold off soon, saw its savings
shares fixed L222 or 12.7 per cent higher at L1,970. By contrast, its
ordinary shares fell L89 to L3,180.
Fiat was active on renewed talk of an accord with a Japanese carmaker. The
stock gained L5 to L4,130 but then rose to L4,280 after hours.
AMSTERDAM was boosted by a stronger financial sector while Ahold stood out
with a gain of Fl 1.40 to Fl 91.30 on positive results from its wholesaling
division. The CBS Tendency index closed 1.0 firmer at 96.5.
VNU put on Fl 1.40 to Fl 89.40 on good 1992 net profit figures while
Elsevier firmed Fl 1.10 to Fl 121.90.
ZURICH saw CS Holding fall SFr70 to SFr2,100 amid speculation that Credit
Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank and CS Holding's main asset, could
take over Swiss Volksbank. Volksbank has been suspended at its own request
pending an announcement today.
Other stocks rose on lower interest rates and a firm dollar, Nestle bearers
putting on SFr15 to SFr1,165. The SMI index closed 10.8 higher at 2,128.5.
MADRID advanced on the prospect of lower German interest rates and the
general index closed 4.93 higher at 220.53. Turnover was strong at Pta13bn.
Endesa gained Pta215 or 5.7 per cent to Pta3,990.
STOCKHOLM rose in an active but shortened session ahead of today's holiday.
The Affarsvarlden general index added 21.5 to 951.5 in turnover of SKr494m.
Volvo's B shares climbed another SKr15 to SKr373, aided by the firm dollar
and figures which indicated that its US sales rose 50 per cent in December.
Astra A shares advanced SKr13 to SKr765, an all-time high. The dollar
contributed to the 4.9 per cent rise in the forestry sector.
OSLO soared 3 per cent, helped by the dollar and hopes of lower interest
rates. The all-share index climbed 11.43 to 390.81 in turnover of NKr306.8m.
HELSINKI extended its 1993 gains to 7.1 per cent, the Hex index closing 37.5
or 4.4 per cent higher at 887.6.
BRUSSELS was lifted by positive sentiment elsewhere and the Bel-20 index
finished up 13.07 or 1.2 per cent at 1,138.53.
VIENNA regained some of Monday's losses, encouraged by neighbouring markets.
The ATX index rose 13.31 to 736.33 with OMV up Sch25 to Sch615.

FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens as Hong
Kong jumps 2 per cent
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LACK OF fresh news and low volume in the first week of trading after the new
year holiday left share prices weak, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 151.50 down at 16,842.58. The day's high of
17,013.34 came shortly after the opening, and the index fell to a low of
16,688.47 in the early afternoon.
Volume, at 160m shares, remained at the low level set by Monday's half-day
80m. Declining stocks outnumbered gainers by 667 to 202, with 160 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.68 to
1,298.13, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.39 to 1,058.46.
Weak futures prompted arbitrage program-selling in the morning, and downward
pressure continued in the afternoon following reports that the Finance
Ministry would not allow investment trusts to postpone the redemption of
Y2.8 trillion (million million) worth of funds which are likely to mature
below their purchase price later this year.
Brokers are not expecting the market to pick up significantly until later in
the year, but support buying from public pension funds, which are expected
to return to the market later this week, could provide a temporary boost.
Mr Ueki Yasuo, general manager of Nikko Securities' equities operations
group, said the market would be pulled down by outstanding levels of tokkin
funds and investment trust funds in the short term, but that those factors
would be outweighed by buying by public pension funds and foreign investors.
He predicted a range of 16,000 to 24,000 for the Nikkei during 1993, with
the lower level prevailing in the early part of the year.
Mr Chris Newton of James Capel said: 'There is no obvious technical level of
support until we reach 16,000. If we breach 16,000 I would think we would
see fairly hefty buying coming from pension funds and also probably from
foreigners, who in the main are convinced that 16,000 is around the bottom.'
Isuzu Motors was the most actively traded stock for the second day running,
declining Y6 to Y338 on rumours about management changes. Nippon Housing
Loan hit a high of Y327 in active trading before falling back to Y308, down
Y10 on the day on profit-taking.
Mitsumi Electric climbed Y30 to Y1,140 on the expectation of growth in
component exports to the US as its economy recovers, and on news that
Mitsumi is supplying components to game software companies. Nippon Steel
shed Y4 to Y289 in arbitrage-linked selling.
In Osaka the OSE average finished 159 off at 18,424 in volume of 18.9m
shares.
Roundup
TRADING IN the Pacific Rim was active for the time of year.
HONG KONG finished 2 per cent higher on US buying. The Hang Seng index
jumped 110.23 to 5,548.03 in turnover of HKDollars 1.71bn, up from Monday's
12-month low of HKDollars 956m.
Brokers said sentiment was boosted by an interview with Governor Chris
Patten in Monday's London Evening Standard which suggested that there could
be a compromise regarding his democratic reform proposals for the colony.
SINGAPORE soared on foreign buying of blue chips, and dealers forecast
further rises to test the all-time high of 1,607.12 set in March 1990. The
Straits Times Industrial index closed 31.24 ahead at 1,562.35, the highest
level since June 1991 when it hit 1,565.58. Volume was an active 156.82m
shares.
KUALA LUMPUR finished lower after a heavy fall in Multi-purpose group shares
sparked selling across the board. The composite index lost 1.94 at 630.89 in
volume of 84.3m shares, compared with Monday's 72.4m.
Multi-purpose and its associates fell on a lack of news about approval from
China to start a gaming venture there. Dunlop Estates dropped MDollars 1.50
to MDollars 6.40 and Magnum was down 35 cents at MDollars 8.20.
Multi-purpose shed 21 cents to MDollars 1.69 in volume of 12.63m shares.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to end lower on this year's first day of trade.
Political worries ahead of a cabinet reshuffle, expected by early February,
weighed on prices.
The weighted index, more than 30 points higher at one stage, ended 34.88
down at 3,342.18 in moderate turnover of TDollars 8.7bn.
SEOUL retreated on profit-taking after Monday's sharp gain. The composite
index dipped 6.62 to 690.79 in turnover of Won667.62bn.
Construction issues were higher on hopes of a planned relaxation of
government restrictions on property development. Hyundai Engineering and
Construction finished the day's limit up, gaining Won800 at Won19,000.
AUSTRALIA ran into a late burst of profit-taking after opening sharply
ahead. The All Ordinaries index closed at 1,564.8, up 4.3 but after touching
1,574.7, in turnover of ADollars 454.7m. BHP dragged the market down in late
selling, losing 4 cents to ADollars 13.56.
NEW ZEALAND rose in the first trading session of the year, the NZSE-40 index
adding 16.59 at 1,583.43 in NZDollars 18.5m turnover. Fletcher Challenge
advanced 15 cents to NZDollars 2.60.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH cash rates moved up sharply again yesterday after the Bank of France
suspended the 5 to 10-day lending window and lifted overnight rates to 12
per cent, writes James Blitz.
The French move was the focal point of a rather bearish day in cash and
futures markets. French futures fell back sharply on the move, while
Euromark futures were temporarily depressed by the Bundesbank's decision not
to change money market rates, as had been expected.
Sterling money market dealers ignored a powerful rally by the pound against
the D-Mark. Sentiment in the cash market was depressed by the Bank of
England's decision to offer a longer-dated repurchase agreement.
France's decision to raise short-term rates was deemed a 'pre-emptive
strike' by some dealers. Although the franc has come under renewed pressure
in the European exchange rate mechanism since the new year, forex trading
volumes still seem very thin, and the move had not been expected.
The decision to suspend the 5 to 10-day lending window created thinner
liquidity in the market, and cash rates moved up sharply. The overnight rate
climbed to around 15 per cent from the previous day's 13 1/2 per cent, while
three-month closed at around 13 3/4 per cent. The March French franc
contract fell to 90.29 after ending at 90.48 on Monday.
Euromark futures fell back in the morning after the Bundesbank announced
that it would not push its repo rate below the previous fixed rate of 8.75
per cent as some had expected. However, it added a net DM5.5bn in an
allocation that was thought generous.
In the sterling market, three-month money firmed to 7 1/8 per cent from a
previous close of around 7 1/16 per cent, in spite of a strong rally by
sterling against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
The poorer sentiment may have been caused by the Bank of England's decision
to sell Pounds 210m in a repurchase agreement due on March 1 at a rate of 6
29/32 per cent. By asking dealers to tie up funds until then, the Bank
created the impression that there would be no chance of a cut in base rates
until the spring.
A strong feeling in the market was that this was a technical move, resulting
from the large shortages in the system. But the March short sterling
contract declined 6 basis points to end at 93.38.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc steady as pound surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of France yester-day reversed the French franc's recent slide
against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism by raising its
official short-term interest rates, writes James Blitz.
After closing at FFr3.4190 to the D-Mark in London on Monday, the franc
ended yesterday at FFr3.4140, more than a centime above its ERM floor
against the German currency.
However, it was unclear last night whether the interest rate change had done
anything more than buy time for the French authorities. 'A big question mark
remains over whether France can maintain the existing parities,' said Mr
Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London.
Sterling appeared to profit remarkably from the renewed crisis over the
French franc, and a growing feeling that the UK economy is set for an
economic upturn. The pound gained more than 5 pfennigs against the D-Mark,
finishing at DM2.5100.
France's decision to suspend the 5 to 10-day lending rate and raise the
overnight rate to 12 per cent will have made it prohibitively expensive for
dealers to borrow francs in order to speculate with them.
According to some dealers, the rise in rates was a pre-emptive measure by
the French authorities, who attempted to scare off speculators before the
franc came under significant pressure.
The authorities would also have been concerned that commercial banks could
'round trip', borrowing at the 5 to 10-day rate of 10 per cent and lending
at higher money market rates.
But money market rates rose even more sharply on the move, with the
overnight rate reaching 15 per cent yesterday. With French unemployment at
10.5 per cent and an election less than two months away, such high rates may
be unsustainable for long.
There was no overt intervention in support of the French currency yesterday
from either the Bundesbank or the Bank of France. But news agencies reported
a senior German government official as saying that the Bundesbank had spent
DM3.5bn defending the franc on Monday.
The figure, if true, may help to appease those dealers who believe that
German intervention is limited by fears of exacerbating money supply. A
dealer, however, suggested that it may indicate the worrying scale which the
crisis has already reached.
Sterling's spectacular rise to DM2.51 yesterday was partly attributed to
tensions in the heart of Europe. Mr MacKinnon of Citibank warned that it
would be premature to use the phrase 'safe haven' when referring to the
British currency. But he said there was a growing feeling that the British
economy was set for an upturn, a view underlined by good money growth
indicators yesterday. M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between
November and December.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian tar sands come of age
 -Synthetic crude has been made competitive by years of gradual improvement
of extraction technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S VAST Athabasca tar sands - where extraction plants last year
produced their billionth barrel of crude oil - have come of age, and promise
to be an even more important source of energy in the future.
Years of gradual improvement in extraction technology mean that synthetic
crude from the tar sands is now competitive with crude from more
conventional sources, particularly when exploration costs are included.
'Like the North Sea, the relatively lean price regime we have had over the
past eight years has been an incentive to cost reduction,' says Mr Campbell
Watkins, president of oil consultancy DataMetrics and an adjunct professor
of economics at the University of Calgary.
'The tar sands are close to competitive with the North Sea, and the
economics have improved and will continue to improve,' he says.
When the giant Syncrude complex at Fort McMurray in Alberta was planned and
built during the 1970s, it was widely regarded as a very costly white
elephant. Now it is seen as a quiet success, reliably producing synthetic
crude oil at a cost of just under CDollars 15 (USDollars 12) a barrel, while
continuing to improve a technology that would justify expansion at oil
prices not much above today's.
Both major tar sands plants passed milestones in September - Syncrude, which
has been operating since 1978, pumped its 600 millionth barrel; its older
and smaller sister Suncor, which started up in 1967 as Great Canadian Oil
Sands, reached a total of 400m barrels. Between them, the two plants produce
about 16 per cent of Canada's crude oil, and that proportion is expected to
rise as conventional production falls off.
Syncrude estimates that a further 200bn barrels, more than the reserves of
Saudi Arabia and its neighbours combined, are recoverable using present
extraction techniques. Estimates of total reserves run as high as a trillion
(million million) barrels.
This huge resource has inspired a large number of projects since the turn of
the century, most of which have foundered in the face of financial or
technical problems. The success of Syncrude and Suncor in bringing their
efficiencies up and costs down has inspired backers to consider a number of
potential projects in recent years, but oil prices have been a little too
low.
Mr Watkins says: 'It wouldn't take much more. If we had the prospect that
prices would be maintained at USDollars 25 per barrel, there might be room
for a new plant'. That prospect has receded recently, however, with Brent
blend, the North Sea marker crude, slipping below Dollars 18 a barrel.
The new facility would be able to benefit from a steady series of
improvements in the cost structure of the Alberta oil sands industry. In
1980, two years after Syncrude started production, it was producing
synthetic crude at a cost of about CDollars 25 a barrel in 1980 dollars. It
now has reduced the production cost per barrel to less than CDollars 15 in
1992 dollars, or about CDollars 20 when capital and royalty costs are taken
into account.
Mr Phil Lachambre, Syncrude's vice president of business and corporate
affairs, says that the improvement has come about half through a gradual
refinement of the processes and half through new technologies.
The raw tar sands are turned into oil by first mixing them with hot water;
the bitumen floats to the top and is skimmed off. The bitumen is then
converted into synthetic crude by a series of processes, including
extracting sulphur and adding hydrogen.
Improvements over the years have ranged from better techniques for mining
the raw mixture, to more effective processing of the separated bitumen,
producing increased yields and much higher labour productivity.
The synthetic crude produced by the plants is very marketable - 8 degree
gravity bitumen is turned into 32 degree gravity crude. This compares with
the 40 degree gravity of the best light crude produced in Southern Alberta.
But the tar sands product is particularly 'sweet', or low in sulphur, says
Mr Lachambre.
Production efficiencies at Syncrude are such that the plant, designed to
produce 50m barrels a year, has been bumping up against its permitted
ceiling of 63m. It has therefore applied to Alberta's Energy Resources
Conservation Board to have this limit increased to 79m barrels. In addition,
Syncrude has outstanding permission, granted in 1988, for a CDollars 4.5bn
(USDollars 3.6bn) expansion that would add a further 30m barrels of oil a
year to its capacity.
By way of comparison, another of Canada's energy 'megaprojects', the
development of the 650m-barrel Hibernia oil field in the Atlantic off
Newfoundland, is set to produce 40m barrels a year starting in 1997 at an
anticipated cost of CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.16bn).
However, in spite of the existing Syncrude plant's average annual return on
capital employed of 6 per cent over the past five years - twice the average
for Canada's oil industry - expansion plans are on hold until oil prices
recover.
In the meantime, Canada's oil industry keeps planning for the day when oil
prices rise again. In 1991 OSLO, a group of leaseholders in the tar sands,
including Imperial Oil, the Exxon subsidiary that owns 25 per cent of
Syncrude, shelved separate plans for a new Dollars 4bn (USDollars 3.2bn)
plant.
But nobody doubts that extracting synthetic crude from tar sands is a viable
business, and any decisive upwards move in the oil price could be met with a
torrent of production from Canada's north after a few years.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium output reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM producers outside the former eastern bloc countries reacted to the
continuing heavy flow of the metal to the west from Russia by cutting output
by more than 4 per cent last year compared with 1991, according to
preliminary estimates by the UK-based World Bureau of Metal Statistics.
At the same time, however, western nickel producers, which have also been
suffering severely from Russian exports, produced marginally more refined
metal.
According to the WBMS, western world consumption of aluminium, copper, tin
and zinc rose last year whereas lead consumption fell slightly and that of
nickel dropped sharply, by nearly 7 per cent, from the 1991 level.
Nickel's fall followed one of more than 10 per cent in the previous year
compared with 1990.
It was caused by a de-stocking and a drop in demand from the stainless steel
industry which consumes more than 60? per cent of the metal.
All six of the most heavily traded metals showed a deficit in western world
supply last year, the WBMS estimates. But net imports from the eastern bloc
are likely to have filled the gaps.
In the first nine months of 1992 net exports of aluminium from the eastern
bloc to the west rose from 507,000 to 540,000 tonnes, according to the
latest WBMS quarterly summary.
Net imports of nickel are shown to have fallen steeply, from 81,000 to
21,000 tonnes. However, this total does not include huge quantities of
nickel which is circumventing Russia's export controls by being sent to the
west disguised as scrap.
Net exports of copper from the former eastern bloc were marginally up after
nine months of 1992 - despite substantial imports by China.
The WBMS suggests they rose rose from 233,000 to 242,000 tonnes.
Net imports of zinc, at 113,000 tonnes after nine months of 1992 compared
with 73,000 tonnes, were above the 100,000 tonnes recorded for the whole of
1991.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk Marketing Board to slash
head office staff by 60 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OXFORD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILK Marketing Board is cutting its 560-strong head office staff by 60
per cent as it prepares for the end of its 60-year-old statutory monopoly.
Some time next year, the board, which serves 30,000 dairy farmers in England
and Wales, will turn itself into a voluntary co-operative to be known as
Milk Marque.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the MMB, told the Oxford farming
conference that Milk Marque would be starting out with zero market share.
The decision to cut jobs had been taken reluctantly, he said, but 'we mean
business'.
For dairy farmers the demise of the MMB would overshadow all other farming
upheavals including reform of the European Community's common agricultural
policy and the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But the reform was inevitable because of changes in both the political
climate and in the milk market, Mr Dare suggested. He pointed out that
doorstep milk sales were falling 8 per cent a year, while supermarket sales
were rising by 20 per cent.
'The trend is very clear,' he said.
Milk Marque would embrace the free market wholeheartedly - any farmer would
be able to supply any buyer and any buyer could source milk from any farm.
Total annual turnover would be about Pounds 2.5bn a year, which might appear
huge he said, but compared with Pounds 19bn for Nestle and was roughly
equivalent to Unigate's. Such a turnover was needed when four dairy
companies were buying two-thirds of the milk in England and Wales, Mr Dare
added.
It would give Milk Marque the necessary muscle to compete in 'the premier
league' of the EC, with its 350m customers.
The pressure brought by the UK's largest retailers on farmers and growers
has been very much for the good, Mr George Paul, chief executive of
Harrisons and Crosfield, told the conference. 'The quality of food,
particularly fresh vegetables and fruit, available in supermarkets has
improved out of all recognition over the last decade,' he said.
Mr Paul contended that producing to the fullest quality standards 'would be
sufficient to ensure the livelihood of most producers, providing that they
are wise in their choice of customer or intermediary'.

COPPER prices touched three-month dollar highs yesterday, in response to
further Chinese buying and the announcement of an unexpectedly-large fall in
London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks. The three months price reached
Dollars 2,372 a tonne before profit-taking trimmed it to Dollars 2,360, up
Dollars 6 on the day. The pound's strength against the dollar meant that
prices were down in sterling terms, however, the three months position
sustaining a Pounds 22.50 fall to Pounds 1,555.25 a tonne. Other LME markets
were depressed by big stocks rises. Three months ALUMINIUM fell Dollars
14.50 to Dollars 1,245.25 a tonne, while three months ZINC was Dollars 8.25
down at Dollars 1,077.50 a tonne. But NICKEL, again with the aid of Chinese
demand, defied a substantial rise in stocks to close at Dollars 6,412.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 175 on the day, taking the rise on the week to Dollars
389.50 a tonne. A wave of selling gave London COFFEE and COCOA prices a
battering, the former ending nearly Dollars 40 down in the March futures
position. Cocoa prices were up to Pounds 18 lower.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Overseas companies raise more
funds in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN companies have been tapping the US capital markets for funds in
greater numbers than ever before, according to a study released yesterday by
the Securities Industry Association.
Annualised data compiled by the SIA suggest that total foreign securities
sold in the US primary market in 1992 will approach a record Dollars 67.9bn,
24 per cent more than the Dollars 54.8bn sold the previous year, and seven
times the total sold in 1985.
The SIA said that a number of factors were behind the boom in foreign
issues, including low US interest rates, a favourable dollar exchange rate,
increased demand for foreign debt and equity from US investors, and the
lowering of some regulatory barriers, especially the introduction of rule
144a which has made it easier to sell securities in the private market.
Foreign issuers were also attracted by the size, liquidity and efficiency of
the US capital markets, which last year raised a record Dollars 381.4bn in
straight debt and equity for US and overseas companies.
Last year, foreign issuance of equity and debt was almost evenly distributed
between the public and private markets.
The SIA study, however, believes the use of public markets would be
significantly greater but for the costs and hurdles of registering
publicly-issued securities with the government, which it says remain too
onerous for many foreign companies.
Among overseas issuers of equity in the US, UK companies were the most
active last year, thanks primarily to the Dollars 1.1bn issue of American
Depositary Receipts in July by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group.
Mexico was the next largest foreign issuer. Again one company, Telefonos de
Mexico, which sold Dollars 758m of ADRs in May, dominated.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Bank of France acts to protect franc
against speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE European government bond markets continued to be driven by currency
movements yesterday, with the Bank of France forced to raise its overnight
interest rate in order to curb speculation against the French franc, while
both the German and French central banks stressed their commitment to
defending the D-Mark/franc parity.
Early in the trading session, the Bank of France suspended its 10 per cent
five-to-10 day lending rate and announced an overnight lending rate of 12
per cent.
The move was intended to halt speculation against the franc by making it
more expensive for speculators to borrow funds.
The Bundesbank revealed that it had spent DM3.5bn on intervention to defend
the franc on Monday, when the financial markets reopened after the holiday
break. The Bundesbank and Bank of France issued a joint communique, stating
their intention to defend the franc's parity against the D-Mark.
French government bonds ended the day slightly weaker, but some dealers
remained sceptical over whether the franc can avoid a devaluation.
GERMAN government bonds closed higher on the day on hopes that the
Bundesbank would cut interest rates to alleviate tensions within the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The Liffe bund futures contract rose from the opening level of 92.63 to
reach a high of 92.88 before falling back to around 92.85 by late
after-noon.
Dealers noted particularly strong demand for two-year and three-year paper,
leading to a flattening of the yield curve in that area, while in the
five-to-10 year area the yield curve steepened slightly.
Investors are continuing to flock to the D-Mark bloc due to its safe-haven
status.
UK government bonds closed as much as half a point lower as hopes of a cut
in base rate receded and investors took profits.
Dealers pointed to signs that the UK economy may at last be pulling out of
recession, citing yesterday's provisional money data for December which
showed M0 rising at 3 per cent on the year.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said that the Bank
of England's money market operations yesterday also suggested that a base
rate cut may be delayed until later in the spring. A delay in the next
interest rate cut may have contributed to sterling's strength.
In the cash market, the 9 per cent Treasury stock 2008 ended at 102 3/4 to
yield 8.67 per cent against Monday's close of 103 11/32 .
JAPANESE government bonds rallied strongly on the back of stock market
weakness and hopes of an easing in interest rates, with the cash and futures
markets touching their highest levels in four years.
The March futures contract climbed to a new high of 108.50 before ending the
day at 108.45, up from its opening level of 108.25. In the cash market, the
yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved to 4.495 per cent, corresponding
to the highest price level for the benchmark bond since December 1988,
before ending at 4.505 per cent.
US Treasury prices eased slightly across the board yesterday in the wake of
Monday's strong rally.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 103
9/16 , yielding 7.323 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/16 at 100 1/4 , to yield 4.475 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic news, prices slipped into negative
territory as the market set about consolidating the gains earned on Monday,
when the long bond advanced almost a full point.
The minor correction aside, the focus of attention was firmly fixed on
Friday's employment report for December. Analysts are expecting an increase
of about 80,000 in non-farm payrolls, and for the unemployment rate to
remain steady at 7.2 per cent.

JAPAN'S big four securities houses - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities,
Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are likely to establish trust
banking subsidiaries during the second half of this year.
The move is planned after the enactment of the financial reform law, which
will allow brokers and banks to partially enter each other's business. This
takes place in April.
Japan's brokers, however, are moving ahead slowly with plans to enter the
banking arena, as the merits are yet to be assessed. 'We're not quite sure
of the short-term returns,' said Nikko Securities.
Deregulation of financial barriers between the securities and banking
industries has decelerated substantially due to strong opposition from the
country's ailing brokerages.
The government's original schedule was to allow banks to underwrite
securities and eventually play a larger role in stock trading. However, the
ministry limited the banks' entry to the bond market.
In return for the banks' entry into the bond underwriting business,
brokerages' subsidiaries will be allowed to accept investment trusts,
operate fund trusts and engage in some banking activities.
Musashino Bank, the regional bank, plans a rights issue at Y2,880 a share.
The financing, which will increase the number of shares in issue by 14 per
cent, is aimed at strengthening the bank's management base amid the
increasingly severe market conditions. Musashino shares closed yesterday in
Tokyo at Y5,780.
Kawasaki Steel plans to issue sponsored American Depositary Receipts for
over-the-counter trade today through Morgan Guaranty Trust.
Sponsored ADRs are provided by a single sponsoring bank, with costs and fees
carried by the issuing company.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Issue flood tests investor demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW-ISSUE fever broke out in the international bond markets yesterday. Some
bankers expressed bewilderment about whether investor demand will match the
flow of issues, particularly with large transactions also coming soon from
the World Bank and the Province of Ontario. 'It's the new-issue shop going
mad again, just because it's the start of the year,' said one.
The credit quality of borrowers joining in the early year stampede remained
high, however, with top-rated supranationals featuring prominently.
Credit Suisse First Boston said the two US dollar straights it launched for
Toyota Motor Credit Corp and Intelsat were both successful for different
reasons.
The Dollars 300m three-year issue from Toyota, along with Ford Credit
Australia, one of only two pure corporate borrowers so far this year, sold
to both institutional and retail investors on its name recognition and
benefited from a dearth of quality paper at the shorter end, said CSFB.
Other bankers agreed that the spread on the Dollars 150m seven-year issue
for Intelsat, the international satellite network, was right, but that while
the credit appealed to them, Intelsat's paper tends to be held to maturity
by institutional investors rather than traded.
CSFB said it was premature to comment on rumours that Nordic Investment Bank
was looking to do a Dollars 500m five-year issue through it as lead manager.
The number of collared floating rate note issues is already giving cause for
concern. While acknowledging the appeal of the interest rate floor these
offer to investors, some bankers feel that with eight issues totalling
Dollars 1.1bn in the first two working days of the year, there may be too
much product in the market for the moment.
European Investment Bank's Dollars 250m 10-year issue was arguably the pick
of the day's new collared floaters, while Export Development Corp of
Canada's tighter priced Dollars 100m issue with the same maturity looked
unlikely to sell out quickly. Merrill Lynch, the lead manager, acknowledged
that EDC's pricing was tight but argued that it is an infrequent borrower
which sells well in Switzer-land.
A number of borrowers are considering tapping the Canadian dollar market,
say bankers, for a combination of traditional reasons.
The currency is currently around its historical low point against the US
dollar, leaving room for possible currency appreciation, and investors are
attracted by the yield pick up over the US dollar of around 120 to 130 basis
points.
In the swaps market, spreads are historically high, offering some of the
best opportunities around to achieve sub-Libor funding.
The short burst of activity is not necessarily matched by investor demand,
however, and banks are wary of repeating last year's oversupply when there
were some CDollars 3bn of new issues in January.
The volume of redemptions is unlikely to provide large-scale support for new
issues until March, says Wood Gundy, when the bulk of the first quarter's
CDollars 2.4bn or so of redemptions are due to take place.
Nordic Investment Bank's CDollars 150m five-year issue went reasonably well,
said lead manager Daiwa Europe, although it will take some time to sell.
NIB is competing for attention with Credit Local's CDollars 300m three-year
issue, which was thought to be suffering because of its size and because
Credit Local is perceived as having been a touch too active as a borrower in
the various markets.
In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Finland's DM2bn issue was priced in
the middle of the indicated range, to yield 53 basis points over comparable
US Treasur-ies.
Dresdner Bank, the lead manager, said the yield spread narrowed to 50-51
basis points in later trading. If it stays at that level, an increase is not
ruled out. Deutsche Bank increased its self-led deal to DM1.5bn from DM1bn.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is running the books on a Pounds 200m additional tranche
to the Kingdom of Sweden's five-year issue launched last November, taking
advantage, it said, of domestic and international interest in sterling.
UBS says that while the spread on the new tranche is 10 basis points higher
than the original at 55 basis points over comparable gilts, the cost of
funding to Sweden is less as swap rates have widened further.

PHILIPS of the Netherlands fended off Intel of the US in 1992 to maintain
its 15-year record as Europe's largest semiconductor supplier, according to
figures collated by Dataquest Europe.
The Dutch company had sales of Dollars 1.12bn, just Dollars 16m ahead of
Intel, the world's largest merchant semiconductor manufacturer with
worldwide sales in excess of Dollars 5bn. Intel's success is built on its
best-selling microprocessors, including the 386 and 486 chips used in the
majority of personal computers of IBM design.
In Europe, the company's revenues grew 45 per cent, taking it from fifth to
second place. Its US competitor, Motorola, moved to third with sales of
Dollars 976m, a 26 per cent advance on the year before. European companies
Siemens and SGS-Thomson slipped to fourth and fifth places respectively.
INTEL, the US chipmaker, became the world's largest semiconductor supplier
in 1992, overtaking NEC and Toshiba of Japan, according to a market survey
published yesterday by Dataquest, the US market research group, writes
Louise Kehoe.
Intel's revenues grew by 26 per cent in the year, a rise of over Dollars
1bn. NEC and Toshiba, ranked two and three, showed a modest 4 per cent
growth.

MALAYSIA'S Renong group, the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the United
Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the country's main political party, has
announced plans to sell the bulk of its newspaper and TV interests.
Renong is to sell its 48 per cent stake in The New Straits Times Press
(NSTP), Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group, and its 43 per
cent shareholding in TV3, the country's only privately-owned TV station, for
MDollars 800m (USDollars 320m).
A management buyout of both enterprises is being undertaken with Realmild, a
company formed by four senior NSTP executives, taking the entire Renong
shareholding in both companies.
The deal values Renong's 86.5m NSTP shares at about MDollars 7.12 each and
the 36.7m TV3 shares at MDollars 5 each. Mr Mohamd Noor Mutalib, a Realmild
official, said a premium had to be paid to gain control of the two
companies.
Realmild is believed to have close links with Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
finance minister. Mr Anwar is said to be positioning himself to succeed Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: The true-life corporate soap
opera at Astra - William Keeling traces the likely fate of Indonesia's
second-largest company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's second-largest company which dominates the
country's motor vehicle sector, has for two months been the subject of a
true-life corporate soap opera.
With the Soeryadjaya family, the company's founders, selling shares to raise
funds for their privately-owned, bankrupt Bank Summa, the sires of
Indonesian business have been publicly fighting for a stake.
The battle, involving multiple back-stabbing of the highest order, has
undermined investor confidence in the country, raised the cost of offshore
borrowing for Indonesian companies and damaged the government's reputation
for crisis management.
'It's interesting, but it's frightening as well. There's no damage control
we can do,' noted one despondent government official.
Until November 13, the Soeryadjayas owned 178m Astra shares, or 73 per cent
of the company. With the suspension of Bank Summa, and its subsequent order
of liquidation with outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn (Dollars 767m), the
Soeryadjayas began to dispose of Astra shares.
To date, 20m shares have been sold to the pension fund of state-owned Bank
Dagang Negara and 26m shares to state-owned mutual trust Danareksa on
behalf, brokers say, of a second state-owned bank.
A further 20m shares have been purchased through Danareksa by Newark Ltd, a
Honk Kong shelf company, to be held in escrow while negotiations continue
for their purchase with Toyota, Astra's main joint-venture partner.
By authorising these deals, the government has done a swift U-turn from its
position in November. Then, officials stressed they wished to avoid bailing
out Bank Summa, even by the indirect means of using state institutions to
purchase Astra shares.
The December 15 liquidation order on Bank Summa also placed the Soeryadjayas
in default on a Rp500bn loan from a three-bank consortium - state-owned Bank
Exim and Bapindo, and Bank Danamon - against which 100m Astra shares were
pledged.
The banks may now claim these shares, which would place a majority Astra
holding under government control.
Perhaps, for this reason, the Soeryadjayas have been given the breathing
space to negotiate the sale of up to 108m shares to a consortium led by Mr
Prajogo Pangestu, a well-connected timber tycoon.
Mr Pangestu was a key-figure behind the 1990 rescue of Bank Duta, owned by
three charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto, when it suffered
Dollars 419m in foreign exchange losses.
His consortium reportedly includes the Salim group, led by Mr Liem Sioe
Liong, a shareholder in Indomobil, Astra's main competitor; the Sinar Mas
Group, headed by Mr Eka Widjaya; and Mr Sofyan Wanandi's Gemala Group.
Negotiations between the Soeryadjayas and Mr Pangestu have not gone
smoothly. In mid-December, an agreement was signed but then blocked by Mr
Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, Astra's chairman, who said Toyota and banks with
exposure to Astra opposed the make-up of the consortium.
Mr Djojohadikusumo has since resigned and an Astra official has confirmed a
second deal has been struck and is awaiting government approval.
Bankers say the deal involves the purchase of at least 100m shares at
Rp10,000 a share. The funds would be used to repay the Rp500bn
Exim-Bapindo-Danamon loan, and to help clear the debts of companies in the
Soeryadjayas' Summa group, mostly involved in international property, which
government officials say owe Bank Summa over Rp500bn.
The Soeryadjayas equity in Summa group companies is likely to be passed to
the consortium. The consortium would then create a new bank, with a capital
injection of Rp100bn, to which Bank Summa depositors' accounts would be
transferred.
The deal, however, faces serious obstacles. Astra's financial security - it
owes more than Dollars 900m to foreign banks, two-thirds of which is to be
rescheduled within the next 12 months - depends upon the support of its
bankers.
In turn, this depends upon Toyota backing the consortium. According to an
Astra official, Toyota have demanded conditions for its approval, such as
the management of Astra and its big subsidiaries remaining intact.
Bankers say other conditions include consortium members buying shares as
individuals, not as a group, and a cap on an individual's shareholding. But
confidence in Astra has already been damaged and, as one foreign bankers
explained, the company must expect a 'huge difference in pricing' when its
loans are rescheduled.
If the sale is completed, the consortium must persuade Bank Summa's
depositors to maintain their accounts with the new bank. Any run on deposits
would demand the injection of more funds. While finance could be raised by
selling Summa group assets, brokers say this is complicated by the
Soeryadjayas not holding a majority interest in many of the related
companies.
Nor are Bank Summa's liabilities clear. Bankers say that by November its
1991 accounts had yet to be finalised.
Brokers suggest the consortium is paying too high a price for the shares,
valuing the company over 30 times estimated 1992 earnings against a market
average of 15 times.
Bankers are concerned, therefore, the consortium, although not holding a
majority stake, will look to Astra for a quick return on what is a high-risk
investment. This is unlikely to come from Astra's net profits which are
estimated to have fallen 66 per cent in 1992 to about Rp75bn.
Brokers believe 1993 will see Astra's profits rise but differ on the scale.
But they note other means to raise money. While Astra's automotive sector
accounts for 80 per cent of its bottom line, it also has timber,
agribusiness, financial services and electronics divisions. As one foreign
broker noted: 'Astra may be ripe for an asset strip.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Santos acquires AGL oil assets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday consolidated its leadership
of the domestic onshore energy industry by acquiring most of the upstream
oil and gas assets of Australian Gas Light (AGL) for ADollars 177.5m
(USDollars 126.7m).
The deal was well received by the financial markets. Santos shares closed 12
cents higher on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.78. AGL also
closed 12 cents higher at ADollars 2.84.
However, analysts said the deal could reduce Santos' prospects of winning
court approval for a renewed takeover offer for Sagasco Holdings, the South
Australian oil and gas group. Santos was forced to drop a ADollars 560m bid
for Sagasco in November after the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), the
federal competition watchdog, ruled it would give the group an effective
monopoly over onshore gas reserves.
Santos, which bought 19.9 per cent of Sagasco shortly after abandoning the
bid, has indicated the offer may be revived if the federal court rules
against the TPC in a hearing expected to take place in April.
'Our advice is that the takeover bid did not breach (the Trade Practices
Act) so (the AGL acquisition) does not really change that situation,' said
Mr John McArdle, commercial general manager of Santos.
The deal will significantly increase Santos' presence in Queensland, where
it will acquire the Moonie oilfield, the Moonie-Brisbane pipeline, majority
ownership of the Jackson-Moonie pipeline, 50 per cent of the Denison Trough
gas project and 83 per cent of the Roma gas fields.
Mr Len Bleasel, AGL managing director, said the sale price was ADollars 7.8m
above the book value of the assets. 'We will be using the money mainly to
retire debt and strengthen our gearing ratios with an eye to expand
downstream gas operations,' he said.

soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND EUROPEAN acquisitions of Japanese companies more than doubled last
year as manufacturers attempted to improve their local distribution networks
and distressed Japanese enterprises sought foreign assistance.
Yamaichi Securities said the number of Japanese companies acquired by
foreigners rose from 18 to 37, while the corporate finance arm of KPMG Peat
Marwick said the number of deals increased from 18 to 43 last year and was
on a steady upward trend.
Meanwhile, Yamaichi said there were 477 Japanese mergers and acquisitions of
foreign companies last year, down 22 per cent on 1991, and down 44 per cent
in total value to Y550bn (Dollars 4.38bn). The broker said activity was
restricted by a higher cost of capital at home and by the international
recession, which weakened companies' desire to expand.
The value of foreign acquisitions in Japan rose to Y62bn from Y39bn,
according to the Peat Marwick survey, which found that 60 per cent of the 43
deals were acquisitions of distributors or of existing joint venture
partners.
Mr Thomas Lynch, senior manager of Peat Marwick's corporate finance
division, said most of the acquisitions were strategic moves made by already
established foreign companies looking to improve their penetration of the
Japanese market.
He said fear among Japanese employees of being taken over by a foreign
company appears to be receding, while a few distressed Japanese companies,
having fallen out with their banks, are searching for foreign partners.
'We haven't seen any really big acquisitions yet by foreign companies in
Japan, but you might see that in the future. I don't regard this present
period of recession as a brief window of opportunity, and I think we will
see an increase in the future,' Mr Lynch said.
Of the 43 deals, five were of lossmaking Japanese companies, while 14 were
acquisitions of distributors, and 12 involved taking over a Japanese
joint-venture partner's interests. Ten of the investments were significant
minority stakes in Japanese companies.
US companies accounted for 21 of the transactions, followed by German
companies, five cases, Swiss companies, four cases, and UK companies, three
cases, with the remainder other European or Asian-based companies. Eight
were in the pharmaceutical industry, seven in the chemical and industrial
machinery sectors and five in the computer industry.
The fall in Japanese mergers and acquisitions abroad last year left the
totals to close that of 1986, before the frenetic activity of the bubble
era, when there were 451 cases involving Y544bn, according to Yamaichi
Securities.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pennzoil to use Chevron stake to
help raise Dollars 350m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNZOIL, the Houston-based oil company, is using part of a controversial
share stake it built up in rival oil group Chevron more than three years ago
to help raise Dollars 350m.
In an unusual convertible issue being launched simultaneously in the US and
the London-based Euromarkets, the company is selling bonds convertible into
around 3.6m shares in Chevron. This represents just over 1 per cent of
Chevron's ordinary share capital.
Pennzoil paid Dollars 2.2bn for nearly 9 per cent of Chevron in December
1989, prompting a fierce battle between the two oil companies. It agreed
last October to reduce its stake to just over 5 per cent, or 17.2m shares,
swapping the other part of its holding for some of Chevron's US oil and gas
reserves.
The deal also marked the end of a protracted legal dispute between the two.
Chevron had claimed that Pennzoil illegally disguised an intention to gain
partial control over it.
It remained unclear whether the convertible bond issue marked the beginning
of a move by Pennzoil to dispose of its entire Chevron stake.
Investors will be able to exchange the bonds at any time over the next 10
years into Chevron shares at a premium of between 18-20 per cent over their
current value, though Pennzoil will have the right to repay the bonds after
five years at their issue price.
The coupon of between 6 3/4 -7 per cent on the bonds, which are being issued
at par, is only fractionally above the current yield on 10-year US
government paper, though Pennzoil debt only just classifies as investment
grade. It is ranked BBB and BAA2 by the two big US rating agencies, Moody's
and Standard &amp; Poor's.
The terms, which will be finalised early next week, were generally thought
attractive yesterday, and the bonds were quoted at nearly a point above
their issue price in the grey market in London late in the day.
The joint lead managers to the issue, Lehman Brothers and Lazard, hope to
sell Dollars 225m of the bonds in the US and Dollars 125m internationally,
though these amounts may be varied depending on demand. The issue is one of
the largest equity-linked deals in the international market for some time.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Schering turns to core
operations - The chemicals group is selling a series of assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, is focusing
on core operations through a series of asset disposals.
Last month, the group completed the sales of two of its divisions,
manufacturing industrial chemicals and natural substances divisions, to
Witco of the US for DM660m (Dollars 415m). This month it will transfer its
electro-plating operations to Elf Atochem of France. It is actively seeking
a partner for the flagging agrochemicals business.
The aim is to dispose of activities in which Schering holds a small part of
the market and has little chance of becoming a significant player. Sales of
the three disposed divisions were DM895m in the first nine months of this
year, compared with DM1.06bn in agrochemicals. Mr Giuseppe Vita, the Italian
chairman of Schering's executive board, emphasised the company had no
intention of selling off its agrochemicals business but was open for 'global
or regional alliances' as well as co-operation.
The search for a partner in agrochemicals is taking on added urgency as
Schering's output of pesticides and herbicides slid 12 per cent in the first
three quarters of last year. This made up 21.8 per cent of group turnover,
compared with 25.2 per cent in the same period of 1991.
Agrochemicals producers have been hit by a slump in the market and it is
among these companies that Schering is seeking a partner. Talks collapsed
two years ago with Sandoz on a 50-50 joint venture in agrochemicals after
the Swiss company raised its sights to include a share in Schering's
lucrative pharmaceuticals business.
A company source said Hoechst, the German chemicals company, was seen as a
favourite to take over Schering's agrochemicals division. The EC's reform of
the common agricultural policy is seen as the main culprit for the fall in
the agrochemicals market. Farmers, faced with cuts in subsidies for grain
production, are reducing their purchases of plant protection agents. The
payments farmers are to receive for each hectare of land they take out of
cultivation is regarded as a further disincentive to buy agrochemicals.
Mr Vita said the effect of these measures would be a reduction in the
European agrochemicals market of about 15 per cent.  Grain production was
likely to shrink by up to 25 per cent which would affect Sportak, Schering's
top-selling herbicide. Sportak is produced exclusively by Schering's UK
subsidiary, the former FBC, which last year closed down part of its plant
producing Sportak at Hauxton because of excess capacity.
More than 50 per cent of the company's agrochemicals are produced by the UK
subsidiary which, along with German agrochemicals output, will bear the
brunt of a rationalisation programme. The group's UK agrochemicals
operations employ about 1,800 people. Schering began reducing personnel
throughout its agrochemicals business in 1990 and by 1994 aims to cut the
workforce by 20 per cent. The company believes it has a strong hand to play
in its co-operation talks with other agrochemicals producers. Schering's
beetroot herbicide and grain fungicide each has an annual turnover of more
than DM200m.
As a result of last year's divestitures, Schering's turnover this year will
drop 20 per cent to roughly DM5bn. Pharmaceuticals will make up 75 per cent
of sales and agrochemicals the remainder.
Mr Vita said the company intended to concentrate its pharmaceutical
activities on Europe, the US and Japan, which would make it less susceptible
to economic and exchange rate fluctuations. However, although
pharmaceuticals sales rose 10 per cent in the first nine months to DM2.9bn,
group earnings dropped 6 per cent to DM201m because of the depressed state
of chemicals market and adverse exchange rates.
Development and marketing costs are to be reduced by increased co-operation
with other companies. This year Schering entered into a co-operation
agreement on diagnostics with Sterling Winthrop, the US pharmaceuticals
company, under which Schering has an option on all of Sterling Winthrop's
diagnostics for magnetic resonance tomography. In return, the US company
will be able to introduce Schering's Omniscan diagnostic for which it holds
worldwide patent rights. A similar co-operation deal was concluded last year
with Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US.

reports from Kalamazoo.
The US group said the expansion, which is expected to become operational in
1995, would integrate the most advanced technologies in quality control,
productivity and environmental protection.
Mr William Parfet, president, said the investment would enable it to meet
increased demand for non-US clinical supplies.

FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Contest opens for control of
Ebro
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE by two institutions of stock in Ebro, the big Spanish sugar and
rice producer, has opened the contest for control of what is considered the
pearl of the Kuwait Investment Office's investments in Spain.
The stock was held as collateral for loans to Ebro's main shareholder, Grupo
Torras, the KIO's troubled Barcelona-based holding company.
Torras, which went into receivership last month after the KIO claimed it had
sustained losses of Dollars 4bn, owns 36 per cent of Ebro, a company which
closed its financial year in September with estimated net profits of Dollars
54m and a Dollars 96m positive cash-flow. Nearly all of Torras' shareholding
in Ebro is, however, pledged to creditor banks.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which has outstanding loans of Dollars 22m to Torras
guaranteed by some 5 per cent of Ebro's equity, has emerged as an early
player in the contest for the food company by acquiring O8 per cent of its
stock which was held as a collateral by Italy's Banco di Roma.
A second minor Torras creditor, the savings bank Caja del Penedes, has sold
just under 1 per cent of Ebro's equity in order to recover its loans.
Brokers said the Penedes-held shares were widely spread, although the BBV
securities house is understood to have been an active buyer.
As well as from the BBV, Torras also borrowed substantially against Ebro
from Bank of America, Sumitomo and Chase Manhattan. Bank of America's
Ebro-pledged loans to Torras are believed to be in excess of Dollars 86m.
The initial interest shown by BBV in Ebro stock has fuelled speculation that
the bank could be acting in partnership with the Ferruzzi group for the
Italian agribusiness giant has in the past joined forces with the BBV to
acquire major stakes in Spain's edible oils sector.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Belgians acquire Ravenhead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAVENHEAD Company, the glass tableware company based in St Helens,
Lancashire, has been acquired for an undisclosed cash sum by Durobor UK, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Belgium-based Durobor Group.
Mr Jon Peacock of Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance, which acted for
Ravenhead, said that a small proportion of the consideration was deferred.
In 1990, Ravenhead and its Canadian parent were sold to management and US
financial investors in a Pounds 27m buy-in. The Canadian trading company is
now in receivership, and Ravenhead Holdings, after selling its trading
company to Durobor, will be a shell.
Mr Peacock said he was not at liberty to reveal Ravenhead's profits for the
year to June 1992, though he did say that turnover was Pounds 18m. The
results were being signed yesterday, and would be filed shortly, he added.
When asked whether Ravenhead was being rescued, he said: 'Ravenhead will
benefit from the acquisition.'
Ravenhead, which employs 390 people, is market leader in the supply of glass
tableware (mostly glasses and ashtrays) to the licensed victualling trade,
where it has an estimated 50 per cent share.
Mr Peacock said there was synergy in the deal, in that Durobor, which
exports 80 per cent of its production worldwide, is strong in stemware,
whereas Ravenhead is strong on tumblers.

A MODEST improvement to the offer for TVS Entertainment, the former ITV
company for the south of England, is expected within the next week.
International Family Entertainment, the US cable television company founded
by Mr Pat Robertson, the American evangelist, has extended its offer to
January 12.
By Monday IFE had received acceptances from 78.4 per cent of ordinary
shareholders and 40.6 per cent of preference shareholders.
However, it needs 75 per cent of the preference shares before it can
compulsorily buy the rest. Some of the preference shareholders have been
unhappy with the terms offered.
Mr Julian Treger of Restructuring Advisers, who represents a number of
preference shareholders, said yesterday: 'Unless we get a signifi-cantly
improved offer in cash we are not inclined to accept.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Speyhawk agrees debt restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, the technically insolvent property developer, has reached
agreement in principle with its 46 banks on the restructuring of more than
Pounds 300m of debt.
However, the complexity of the deal and the large number of banks involved
means that the agreement is unlikely to be signed for a couple of months.
The restructuring talks, which began 18 months ago, reached a conclusion on
Christmas Eve. The talks involved seven syndicates, with Barclays acting as
principal banker.
The deal will involve the subordination of some of Speyhawk's debt and the
release of guarantees.
Speyhawk announced that it had reached agreement in principle with its lead
banks to restructure its debts at the end of last March, when it announced a
loss for the year of Pounds 217m. The large number of banks involved meant
that restructuring talks dragged on through the year, although the structure
of the package is largely unchanged.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Norwich Union announces cuts in bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, the mutual insurance group, yesterday announced cuts of 7.2
per cent in its pay-outs on short-term with-profits policies.
This is the second year in succession that NU, traditionally seen as
offering a lead to the life insurance industry, has made significant cuts in
bonuses.
On the standard industry assumption that policies are started by a
29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month, pay-outs on 10 year endowments
fell from Pounds 7,532 to Pounds 6,992, a fall of 7.2 per cent. In 1991,
this figure would have been Pounds 8,241.
NU said that business in 10 year policies was heavy during 1983, and it
expects to pay some Pounds 100m in maturities for these policies this year,
about double the figure for last year. Total maturities are expected to be
Pounds 150m.
Falls in 25-year endowment pay-outs, most often used as a mortgage repayment
vehicle, fell by 3.1 per cent from Pounds 60,073 to Pounds 58,237. The 10
year self-employed pension plans saw a fall of 7.2 per cent in pay-outs.
Mr Philip Scott, NU's investment manager, said the bonus cuts reflected the
company's belief that investment returns and inflation will be lower during
the 1990s than they were in the 1980s, and describes the pay-outs achieved
between 1988 and 1992 as 'excessive'.
He also pointed out that current endowment yields, of 13 per cent for 10
year policies and 12.9 per cent for 25 year policies, were ahead of
inflation.
NU predicts that its with-profits fund will average an annual real return of
7 per cent, and a nominal return of 11 per cent during the 1990s. This
compares with figures for 1980-89 of 14 per cent and 21 per cent.
Mr Scott added that the life fund's switch from equities and property into
fixed interest securities, which saw its weighting in bonds rise from zero
in 1989 to 20 per cent by the end of 1992, had already delivered an
investment profit of Pounds 100,000.
Three other mutual life offices announced cuts in bonuses.
Using standard assumptions, Friends' Provident cut pay-outs on 25 year
policies by 1.5 per cent, from Pounds 62,438 to Pounds 61,496 and 10 year
pay-outs by 7.67 per cent, from Pounds 7,457 to Pounds 6,885.
Scottish Life's pay-outs dropped 10.25 per cent from Pounds 6,926 to Pounds
6,216 for 10 year policies and by 4.9 per cent from Pounds 65,496 to Pounds
62,282 for 25 year policies.
Clerical Medical cut bonuses, but for technical reasons this led to a slight
rise in pay-outs for 25 year policies, from Pounds 61,283 to Pounds 61,419.
Its 10 year pay-outs followed the trend.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Seeking haven with Laporte in the storm -
The background to the intervention in the fight for Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE'S intervention yesterday into Wassall's bid for Evode, might appear
to have occurred at five minutes to midnight. But Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's
chief executive, explained his move followed seven years of negotiations
with Evode.
'I first approached Andrew Simon (Evode's chairman), in 1986 but the
businesses didn't fit. Since then, Evode has shed much of its basic plastics
operations and moved into higher-value speciality products,' said Mr Minton.
Laporte made a second approach in January 1992, when the harsh trading
environment resulted in halved pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m at Evode for
the year to September 28 1991, against Pounds 15.2m. Mr Minton described the
results as far from outstanding.
'The results made them vulnerable. With margins of 2 per cent on sales of
Pounds 280m, something wasn't right. We talked between January and May, but
there was a large gap between what we were willing to pay and Evode's
aspirations,' he said.
'Nothing came of the approach, but we explained that if they ever got into
trouble they knew where their friends were. After the Wassall bid was
announced, Andrew Simon's first call after talking to his bankers was to
me,' he explained.
One of the attractions for Evode of Laporte is its strong management team,
which has transformed the business from a low-margin bulk operation into a
successful speciality chemicals company. The group, managed by Mr Minton
since 1980, is concentrated on five core business areas, organic chemicals,
absorbents, metals and electronic chemicals, construction chemicals, and
hygiene and process chemicals.
Mr Minton believed there were clear synergies between Evode and Laporte. Two
of Evode's five business areas - adhesives and polymer compounds - fit
classicly into Laporte's businesses, he said.
Evode's adhesives operations generate sales of about Pounds 85m a year and
mainly supply the construction and automotive sectors. Laporte sells
different types of adhesives to the construction industry through
alternative distribution channels.
Most of Evode's polymer activities would also fit, even though Laporte has
no direct experience in this area, said Mr Minton. He explained the
businesses, with a combined turnover of about Pounds 85m, were all involved
in formulating chemicals, one of Laporte's strengths.
The three polymer operations in the US - supplying high-quality plastics for
the medical, food and electronics industries - all had margins in double
figures. In contrast, the UK footwear business, hit by the recession, and
the Italian operations, were in low-margin markets.
Mr Minton admitted there were some question marks hanging over Evode's other
three main business areas - powder coatings, plastic fabrication and a
miscellaneous bundle of companies.
Powder coatings, generating annual sales of about Pounds 20m, was not an
area in which Laporte operated. Although the sector had the advantage of not
being capital intensive, Mr Minton said he was unsure whether Laporte would
keep powder coatings because of competition from groups such as Imperial
Chemical Industries and Courtaulds.
'When I have to compete with big boys like these, I start getting nervous.'
The five plastic fabrication operations, with annual revenues of Pounds 20m
were less attractive to Mr Minton. Three businesses - in the US, Italy and
the UK - had good margins. Two others required turning around.
The fifth business area involving a miscellaneous grouping, mainly of vinyl
coatings for the wallpaper market had sales of about Pounds 40m. It does not
appear to fit into Laporte's business.
Mr Christopher Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said he was surprised to
hear of Laporte's plans for a radical rationalisation of Evode. In contrast
with Laporte he said he was commited to the powder coatings business and was
not advocating Evode's break-up.
He added: 'We believe we are far more closely related to Evode than Laporte.
We have extensive knowledge of the adhesives and sealants and DIY businesses
from our acquisition of DAP (a US supplier of construction products and
filling compounds).'
Evode's margins are about 5 per cent in the UK, similar to those Wassall
inherited at DAP and Metal Closures, the bottle top group. It managed to
almost double them at both businesses.
Mr Minton also proposed to improve Evode's margins, in the same way he
improved those of Laporte from about 10 per cent during the mid-1980s to
nearly 15 per cent.
The improvement at Evode could be achieved through better pricing policies,
extending product ranges, reducing raw material costs, improved
manufacturing, cutting overheads and better marketing, he said. There would
be significant job losses.
Mr Minton denied the cost of rationalisation would affect earnings. The
group had plenty of experience of cost-cutting and there would be few
environmental costs.
Mr Minton's aim is to ensure the merger with Evode would enhance earnings
per share in the first year. That will partly depend on how much Laporte
pays for Evode. Payment is likely to be made through a mixture of cash and
shares.
Analysts believed Laporte would need to pay about Pounds 70m for the
ordinary shares and at least Pounds 72m for the convertible and cumulative
preference shares. It would also take responsibility for about Pounds 28m
worth of net debt.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tobacco family takes the wheel at Thwaites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the future of Thwaites, the dumper truck maker, has been
resolved in a deal that switches control from executors of the founder, the
late Mr Basil Thwaites, to the Wills tobacco family.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, follows an announcement a year
ago by Thwaites that it was exploring a possible sale of the company.
Along with all UK construction equipment companies, the company has been hit
by a sharp fall in demand and takeover by a Far Eastern-based group looking
for a European manufacturing base initially seemed the most likely outcome.
However, as conditions worsened throughout last year the sums offered failed
to meet with shareholders' expectations. In June, a proposed purchase by BM
Group was withdrawn after it was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The transaction announced this week will transfer full ownership of Thwaites
to Lord Dulverton of the Wills family and his brother Mr Ian Wills. The
family has been a substantial minority shareholder for more than 20 years.
Mr John Webb continues as managing director. Lord Dulverton becomes deputy
chairman, and Mr John Given has been appointed non-executive chairman.
Although the deal is very different from what many observers had originally
predicted, it is a significant boost for Thwaites. In the three years since
Mr Thwaites died, the company has been in limbo, said Mr Webb, and the
transaction would restore a 'clarity of direction.'
However, the priority for Thwaites remains to clinch a joint manufacturing
deal with a foreign company, enabling the company to broaden its product
range and provide more work for its under-utilised plant.
Thwaites incurred a deficit in the year to last August, on sales of about
Pounds 10m. Sales in the current year should be slightly higher, said Mr
Webb.
'We think the UK market will recover, but France and Germany are extremely
iffy.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stonehill shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Stonehill Holdings, the furniture maker and property investment
group, were temporarily suspended at 11p yesterday.
The company said it was in discussions which could lead to a material
transaction.
Stonehill has incurred pre-tax losses for the past three years. In the year
to March 31 1992 the deficit was cut from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 387,000 on
turnover of Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 1.6m).

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Presenting a truer and fairer view - The
implications of a new ruling from the Accounting Standards Board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RULES MAY be made to be broken, but companies bending the letter of the law
to comply with its spirit in presenting their accounts should from now on be
prepared to stand up and take the consequences.
That is the implication of the seventh abstract from the urgent issues task
force of the Accounting Standards Board issued last month, which became
mandatory for year-ends from December 23 1992.
It says that businesses using the 'true and fair' override in the 1985
Companies Act, which exempts them from the law's required format, must state
this fact clearly and unambiguously in the accounting policies note which
immediately follows the primary financial statements.
The note must state the treatment normally required by the act, a
description of the treatment actually adopted, an explanation of why the
normal treatment would not provide a true and fair view, and either a
quantification of the effects of the departure, or an explanation of why it
cannot be quantified.
The ruling is unusual because it appears to add little to the wording in the
act itself, which states that: 'particulars of any such departure, the
reasons for it and its effect shall be given in a note to the accounts.'
But it reflects a frustration that standards-setters and those monitoring
accounts to ensure compliance have been unable to assess the extent to which
the clause is being used honestly.
It will make the job of those reviewing accounts much easier. 'The statement
of this requirement in practice has varied and there has been a tendency for
some companies to understate rather than emphasise the significance of what
they have done,' the task force statement explains.
As Mr Dick Wilkins of the Accounting Standards Board warns: 'The intention
was for use of the true and fair override to be fairly limited.'
A number of companies have been using phrases in the notes to their accounts
justifying a particular treatment as providing a 'truer and fairer' view, or
a similar phrase. Whether they are invoking the override has sometimes been
unclear.
'We felt the use of the override was too low-key and blurred in the past,'
says Mr Wilkins. 'Users might find it difficult to judge when it was being
applied. We wanted to make it much clearer and bring general practice up to
the standards of the better companies.'
There have been a wide variety cases in which the override has been used,
including:
Non-depreciation of investment properties, as specified in SSAP 19.
Offsetting government grants from non-depreciating fixed assets - notably
infrastructure of the water companies.
Placing convertible capital bonds in the balance sheet in reserves rather
than under long-term creditors.
Deducting goodwill from gross shareholders' funds to provide a net figure,
rather than showing it separately.
Non-consolidation of investments by investment trusts and venture capital
companies.
Non-consolidation of subsidiaries held for disposal.
Commodity brokers showing investments at market value, and passing any
increases in value through the profit and loss account.
Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual
accounts, has highlighted a growing tendency in recent months for companies
to use the true and fair override. Its December issue identifies several
examples. These include BM Group, which provides segmental information of
profit including interest but excluding exceptional items.
A note says this is contrary to SSAP 25, the standard on segmental reporting
which requires interest to be excluded, but that the directors consider
'interest is an integral part of the costs of the business and thus to
exclude interest would give a misleading view'.
The task force abstract is unusual because it was not placed on the agenda -
as most of the previous issues under discussion were - by its own members
who had identified the problem among company accounts.
It represents instead a recommendation from the Professional Standards
Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The committee's role to maintain the professional standards of members had
been clouded by the creation of the new accounting bodies and their own
enforcement mechanisms. It is now beginning to find its feet and make
recommendations to the task force on problems which it has identified in
financial reporting.
Since the task force's new abstract is about disclosure as much as
treatment, its effectiveness will be hard to judge. Companies choosing to
ignore it will remain difficult to spot. But those faithfully highlighting,
but wrongly applying the override can expect to hear from the Financial
Reporting Review Panel before too long.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ML Laboratories wins licence for dialysis
drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN ML Laboratories, the USM-quoted medical research and development
company, yesterday jumped 55p to a high of Pounds 11.60 after the group
accompanied its annual results with an announcement that it had won a UK
marketing licence for Dextrin 20, its patented kidney dialysis drug.
The shares have risen 27 per cent since mid-December, lifting the group's
market value to Pounds 318m.
Sales of Dextrin are likely to transform ML's financial position - it has
failed to make a profit since the 1987 listing - if the drug is accepted by
the medical profession and production meets demand.
Pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 496,000 to Pounds 887,000 in the year
to September 30. Turnover rose sharply to Pounds 604,000 (Pounds 288,000)
but higher cost of sales and administrative expenses increased operating
losses to Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 979,000). Losses per share were 3.5p (0.2p).
Dextrin has been billed as a cheaper, safer and easier alternative to the
existing 'mobile' dialysis treatment for people suffering from kidney
failure.
ML estimates 465,000 people are on dialysis worldwide, a figure increasing 9
per cent a year, of whom 65,000 are treated by mobile dialysis.
Directors said ML was applying for licences worldwide and should be able to
sell Dextrin throughout Europe by mid-1994, followed by the US in 1995, and
Japan shortly thereafter.
ML was expanding its manufacturing capacity to meet 20 per cent of UK demand
from its upgraded pilot plant, with construction of new facilities to supply
half of the European market set to start in March.
The group, which is also researching Aids treatments and drug delivery
systems for asthma and cancer treatments, also proposes a 4-for-1 scrip
issue to improve the marketability of its shares.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn Pounds 3.5m combustion
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POWELL Duffryn, the industrial group with interests in distribution and
specialist engineering, has expanded its combustion activities via the
purchase of Airoil-Flaregas from Portals for Pounds 3.5m cash.
Airoil-Flaregas supplies combustion equipment to the refining,
petrochemical, marine and utility industries and has a strong European
presence.
The acquisition will further enhance the combustion division of Hamworthy
Engineering, Powell Duffryn's largest subsidiary.
The division, which has an annual turnover in excess of Pounds 50m, started
its expansion last year with the purchases of Dresser Homes in the UK and
Peabody Engineering in the US.
Over the past 18 months Powell Duffryn has disposed of its quarrying,
shipping fleet and foundry interests. The disposals realised over Pounds
50m.
Powell Duffryn's shares closed 18p higher yesterday at 484p. One analyst
said the rise was attributable to heavier than usual buying in a
tightly-held stock.

FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities 'encouraged' by debt
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Securities, the property, hotels, brewing and pubs group involved in
refinancing discussions with its bankers, said yesterday it was encouraged
by the progress of the talks.
It hoped to be able to put proposals to shareholders and bondholders in the
next few weeks. Meanwhile, the group continues to trade with the support of
its banks.
In a circular to holders of its bonds Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said that
the group had produced a business plan involving an orderly disposal
programme which it had presented to its banks.
However, finalisation of restructuring plans were unlikely to be ready by
the annual meeting to be held on January 28.
Bondholders agreed last October that interest on the bonds should be
deferred and the bonds would not be declared in default until January 18.
Now they are being asked to approve resolutions at another meeting on
January 18 to agree further deferrals until March 1.
The group announced last October that asset write downs had contributed to
net losses for the year to end-March of Pounds 192.4m. The shares have been
suspended since October 1991.

quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of J Bibby, said that the first quarter
of the present year was disappointing but the group as a whole was trading
profitably.
Most divisions had experienced more difficult trading than in the comparable
period, particularly in the UK and Spain.
The capital equipment division was trading at a loss as the benefit of the
actions taken had yet to flow through.
The materials handling division had shown better results helped by a strong
performance from North America.
In the year to September 30 pre-tax profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 32.2m
on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 625.2m.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Scud launcher in Budge assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCUD missile launcher, 50 racehorses, a gold mine in Arizona and a
narrow-boat building yard are among the assets of AF Budge which the Leeds
office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand is now trying to sell.
The privately-owned East Midlands civil engineering group was forced into
receivership by its bankers last month after running out of Pounds 20m of
borrowing facilities. Budge's bankers are understood to have been
unimpressed at the integration of private passion into corporate structure.
The racehorses are still in training and being raced with the receivers'
permission to enhance their value where possible. Coopers has brought in a
bloodstock expert to value them for the January Doncaster sales. Budge had
been due to sponsor a race at Cheltenham last month, but had to withdraw
when the receivers were called in.
The Scud missile launcher is part of one of the world's largest collections
of military memorabilia, another Budge passion. An offshoot of this is a
wholesale and retail small-arms trader.
Other subsidiaries include a marquee business and an airport at Gamston,
south of East Retford, Nottinghamshire, where Budge was based. There is also
property in London's Docklands.
The likeliest prospect for an early sale is Hytek Mouldings, an
injection-moulding company with a projected turnover of Pounds 1.8m and 30
employees, which was advertised in yesterday's Financial Times.
Try Construction, a once-small Uxbridge builder, yesterday emerged as the
buyer of Budge's core building business, at Pounds 500,000 for Pounds 12m of
ongoing contracts. Alfred McAlpine bought the other core business - road and
bridge building - on Monday.
Try has been going national throughout the recession by snapping up failed
contractors in the south-east and the Midlands. Budge will give it a base in
Leeds to expand into north-east England and should add Pounds 20m to Try's
current Pounds 120m turnover.
'We have low gearing and have always kept ourselves healthy in cash terms,
so when these opportunities arise we have been able to move in quickly for
them,' Mr Peter Howell, Try's managing director, said.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Volksbank agrees SFr1.64bn takeover: CS Holding's move opens
way for Swiss rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third-largest
bank, is to acquire Swiss Volksbank, the fifth-largest, in an agreed share
exchange deal that values Volksbank at SFr1.64bn (Dollars 1.14bn).
The two said in a statement last night that the acquisition aimed to
'enhance the earning power and competitiveness' of both Volksbank and Credit
Suisse. It would also contribute to further specialisation among the banking
subsidiaries within the CS Holding group.
The statement said that Credit Suisse would concentrate on international
activities, securities underwriting and major corporate and institutional
clients.
Volksbank would keep its identity, focusing on business with small and
medium-sized companies and private clients within Switzerland. 'At the same
time, Volksbank and Credit Suisse will assume a leading position in the
Swiss retail banking market.'
Analysts have observed that there is considerable duplication between the
branch networks of the two banks, and the statement said 'both banks will,
from the outset, take steps to improve organisational efficiency by
rationalising wherever possible'.
Under the terms of the deal, CS will offer to exchange three of its
registered shares for SFr500 worth of Volksbank equity. The purchase price
is a substantial premium on the SFr1.1bn market capitalisation of Volksbank
before the shares were suspended on Monday morning.
CS said last night that it did not hold any Volksbank shares.
The takeover constitutes a big step towards the rationalisation of
Switzerland's bloated retail banking sector.
The word 'overbanked' is trotted out in many countries these days, as
profit-squeezed banks seek to justify their cost-cutting programmes. But few
can outdo Switzerland in this regard.
According to a recent study by McKinsey &amp; Co, the international consultants,
there is one bank branch in the country for every 67 inhabitants. This
compares with one for every 102 people in Britain, one per 136 in France and
one per 105 in Germany.
The McKinsey study also claimed that the return on equity invested in retail
banking in Switzerland in 1990 averaged a negative 37 per cent.
For a long time, Swiss banks could tolerate subsidising their retail
activities. Most of them are universal banks and they were making lush
profits in other sectors, especially in securities trading where commissions
were fixed.
But with the collapse of fixed commissions and other cozy conventions in the
past few years, banks have had to seek profits from all their activities.
The pressure on the retail sector has intensified even more in the past two
years as many mortgage loans have gone sour in the recession.
Swiss banking leaders have thus become ever more confident in predicting a
big shakeout among the country's 600-odd banks. Mr Robert Studer, chief
executive of Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's largest, said
last March that he could see 100 of them disappearing in the next decade.
Other analysts talk of 20,000 of the industry's 115,000 jobs being lost in
the next few years.
The shakeout is already well under way. Credit Suisse snapped up Bank Leu,
the country's fifth-largest bank, after a hostile bid in late 1990. Swiss
Bank Corporation (SBC), the second-largest, last year consolidated its
control of Banca della Svizzera Italiana. Several small regional banks have
merged with each other or been absorbed by big banks in the past year. The
two cantonal banks in Geneva are set to merge at the end of this year.
The Credit Suisse takeover of Volksbank will open the way for the biggest
single step yet. This is because the branch networks of both are very large
and overlap virtually completely.
Most of the 191 Volksbank branches could be eliminated without loss of
market coverage. The operation will be long, costly and will generate a lot
of political flak, as was shown in the slump of the bearer shares of CS
Holding by SFr70 yesterday to SFr2,100 following the group's confirmation
that it was interested in Volksbank. But Mr Rainer Gut, the CS Holding
chairman, is known for his thick skin.
There are other possible reasons for Credit Suisse's interest in Volksbank.
In his speech last March, UBS's Mr Studer said, perhaps mischievously, that
one of the big three might ultimately decide to withdraw from retail
banking. Analysts instantly concluded that he was referring to Credit
Suisse, the smallest of the three.
Credit Suisse leaders have since been at pains to emphasise their total
commitment to retail banking, and Mr Gut has even hinted on occasion that
the group might contemplate an acquisition in the retail sector.
It will also add legitimacy to the costly decision in 1987 to form a holding
structure for the CS group. Last night, the group confirmed that its banking
subsidiaries would be more specialised in the future with Volksbank
concentrating on small business lending in Switzerland.
The takeover will enable Credit Suisse to close substantially the gap in
assets between it and its two larger rivals. At the end of June, 1992, UBS
had total assets of SFr258.8bn, SBC SFr201bn, Credit Suisse SFr163.7bn and
Volksbank SFr48.5bn.
Although Volksbank's profits have tumbled in recent years, it is still well
capitalised, with a 10.2 per cent capital ratio under the BIS guidelines. Mr
Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich,
estimates that a streamlined Volksbank could make annual profits of up to
SFr300m.
Analysts have been intrigued for months by a sudden surge in trading in
Volksbank shares that took place in the early autumn, when the price bounced
back from a low of SFr610 in early September to over SFr770 by the end of
October.
On October 28, the bank announced it would convert its capital structure
from that of a co-operative, with one vote per shareholder regardless of the
size of his holding, to a joint stock company. Terms of the conversion, due
to be approved by shareholders in April, have not yet been revealed.
There are no laws in Switzerland requiring potential bidders to reveal their
holdings once they have gone over a certain level.

FT  06 JAN 93 / M and S trading statement boostsconfidence in UK retail
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKS and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, gave another small boost
to confidence in the retail sector yesterday as it announced it had
performed well over Christmas, with full-price sales higher than the year
before.
M and S shares rose 8p to 333p on the news, which followed a similar
statement on Monday from the Storehouse group, which includes BhS and
Mothercare.
The City is awaiting trading statements expected from Boots on Friday and
Ratners next week, and Dixons' interim results next Wednesday, for further
signs that Christmas trading was stronger than in the previous year. January
sales were widely reported to have enjoyed their busiest start for years.
M and S said its performance had been encouraging throughout the Christmas
period, with trading particularly strong in the three weeks ending January
2.
Heavy buying in the week up to Christmas left it with considerably less
stock to be marked down for the post-Christmas sales than previously.
Full-price sales were well up on the year before, although, the company
said, 'we are not talking double figures'. Analysts are maintaining their
forecasts for pre-tax profits of between Pounds 720m and Pounds 730m for the
year to March 31, from Pounds 623.5m last year.
'Christmas was not a bonanza for M and S, but it did happen,' said Mr John
Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest.
The chain said sales of clothing had been strong and there had also been a
'noticeable upturn' in home furnishings from September onwards. On the food
side, fresh foods, recipe dishes and speciality Christmas dishes sold well,
although sales were affected by the decision not to open on Sundays. M and S
said it was assessing the impact of the decision.
Retailers and analysts still warn against seeing the news of brisk trading
during the sales as the first sign of economic recovery.
M and S said trading patterns were similar to 1987 - the last time Christmas
Day fell on a Friday, resulting in a long final week before Christmas, and
January sales beginning on bank holiday Monday.
'Economically, you couldn't find two more diverse years, but the pattern of
trading was very similar,' M and S said.

FT  06 JAN 93 / County council job cuts threat: Tens of thousands of posts
at risk, mainly in north and Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY COUNCILS are poised to make tens of thousands of redundancies over
the next few months, adding to the wave of job losses announced before
Christmas by the large city authorities.
County councils are currently discussing draft budgets for next year.
Prospects are growing of large-scale job losses in those counties, mainly in
the Midlands and the north, which face capping by the government if their
spending rises by more than a tiny margin on this year.
With education by far the biggest responsibility of counties, that will mean
widespread teacher redundancies, and large cuts in spending on schools.
Humberside has advised the Department of Employment that 1,000 job losses
could be in the offing, and it has warned schools that funding for their
devolved budgets next year could be as much as 7.5 per cent down on this
year.
Derbyshire has advised that 2,000 job losses are in prospect, 1,000 of them
in education, unless the government revises its criteria for capping council
spending.
According to the Association of County Councils, a further 12 of England's
39 county councils are constrained to a spending increase of less than two
per cent above this year's level, placing them in a similar predicament.
Mr Martin Doughty, Labour leader of Derbyshire county council, said: 'The
government's spending assessments are deeply unfair. We have no reserves
left, yet our spending is being capped at only 1.75 per cent above this
year. Unless it is changed, there will have to be big job losses.'
County councils in the south-east are less badly affected. Most have been
allowed to increase their spending by more than the prevailing inflation
rate, since their spending for this year is generally well below the capping
level. However, counties in the north claim that they are also benefiting
unfairly from changes to government spending assessments.
London boroughs and smaller district councils in the north are also shedding
staff in large numbers.
The London borough of Lambeth is to lose 1,000 posts. North Tyneside council
will today issue compulsory redundancy notices, and aims cut out 1,100 of
the 9,500 people employed in April 1992.
To the surprise of North Tyneside's leaders, 700 employees have volunteered
to leave, substantially reducing the compulsory redundancies required. The
redundancies come on top of a loss of 1,000 jobs between April 1990 and
1992.
Moreover, the council, which in 1991 lost a national test case legal battle
over the enhanced voluntary severance scheme it was then offering, is now
giving volunteers no more than the statutory terms to which they are
entitled.
Of the 700 volunteers, who include 200 teachers, the majority are over-50s
taking early retirement. They qualify for enhanced pension and lump sum
payments on top of their redundancy payment.
Average redundancy payments made to the volunteers are Pounds 5,600 for
white collar staff and Pounds 2,200 for manual workers.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Pit closures fight stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER CHALLENGES to force a resumption of work at threatened pits and to
refund lost earnings of laid-off miners were mounted yesterday as unions
intensified their campaign to keep mines open.
Following meetings at the Trades Union Congress in London yesterday, mine
and rail unions also said they would next week consider a national
stay-at-home day of action in protest at threatened pit closures, job losses
and privatisation.
That could cause friction with other unions and the TUC, which is planning a
day of action next month when TUC officials expect unemployment to exceed
3m.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said he
had written to the prime minister saying that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, was personally liable for more than Pounds 100m paid
by the government for miners' severance payments since the announcement in
October that 31 pits were to be closed.
Mr Scargill's contention follows the High Court judgment in December that
the government had acted unlawfully in deciding to close 31 pits without a
proper review. He told Mr Major that taxpayers' money had been spent
unlawfully on severance payments and that Mr Heseltine was in the same
position as local councillors or company directors who had incurred
liabilities for illegal acts.
Mr Scargill also demanded the resumption of production at the 10 pits
earmarked for immediate closure, and the refunding of lost earnings for
miners laid off on basic pay since October.
The more important legal argument now centres on the 10 pits, which were
excluded from the Department of Trade and Industry review of the original
closure decision.
The unions insist that the High Court ruling means a version of the
industry's Modified Colliery Review Procedure has to be implemented for the
10 pits. This means it could be early summer before a decision is made.
The High Court ruling appears to give the unions the right to reject the
government's decision to appoint John T. Boyd, the US mining consultancy, as
the independent reviewer of the 10 pits.
Mr Scargill said yesterday the unions would reject Boyd and quoted from the
ruling: 'It is for British Coal and the unions to decide how . . . an
independent scrutiny should be conducted and who should conduct it.'
The unions also argue that work should resume at the 10 pits or it may be
impossible to resume profitable production when the review is complete. The
TUC claims that the cost of keeping the pits open but not producing coal is
nearly Pounds 5m a week.
The government is determined not to start coal production. British Coal said
production would stop next week at Betws colliery in Wales which is the only
one of the 10 where it has been continuing.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Boeing in super jumbo talks with two Airbus partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets, is negotiating
with Deutsche Aerospace and British Aerospace over joint development of a
550 to 800 seat super jumbo aircraft which could enter service early in the
next century.
The move poses a significant threat to the European Airbus consortium,
Boeing's principal rival, which is also studying the development of a large
capacity airliner.
Deutsche Aerospace, part of Daimler-Benz, and BAe are partners in Airbus
with 37.9 per cent and 20 per cent shares respectively in the consortium. If
successful, the discussions with Boeing could lead to a sweeping realignment
in the commercial aerospace industry and undermine the cohesion of the
20-year-old Airbus consortium.
Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing,
yesterday said the company expected to sign an agreement soon with Deutsche
Aerospace to launch a joint feasibility study for a new generation super
jumbo.
BAe said it would be 'a willing partner' to enter a broad dialogue with
Boeing and other manufacturers on the feasibility of a super jumbo, which
would be expected to involve more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in
research and development costs.
Mr Hayhurst said Boeing has also had discussions on the project with several
other companies including the three big Japanese manufacturers, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.
The three Japanese companies already co-operate with Boeing on the 777 and
767 widebody programmes but were approached by Airbus to consider joining it
in the development of a large capacity airliner.
Boeing started studying the development of a super jumbo 18 months ago. Mr
Hayhurst said preliminary studies suggested room did not exist for more than
one viable super jumbo project.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine maker, said last night it was in talks with
both Boeing and Airbus about powering future 550 to 800 seat aircraft. The
two big US aero-engine manufacturers, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney,
have also been studying new heavy thrust engines to power super jumbos.
By attempting to lure Airbus partners in the joint development of a super
jumbo, Boeing is seeking to consolidate its dominant position in the large
aircraft market. Mr Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, said: 'We'll take
whatever actions necessary to do that, whether that means making major
investments in research and development, or looking at possible
international alliances.'
Boeing has a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner market. Airbus, its
main competitor, has 26 per cent.
Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group with a 37.9 per cent
stake in Airbus, said it had not had talks with Boeing over a new large
aircraft. However, it indicated it was interested in taking part in any
industry-wide feasibility study to develop a super jumbo. The other partner
in Airbus is Casa of Spain with a 4.2 per cent stake.

FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One notable feature of the UK equity market since Black Wednesday has been
the way second rank stocks have outperformed the FT-SE 100 index. The
performance is all the more remarkable given the heavy representation of
defensive utilities in the FT-SE 250. In part that reflects the easing of
interest rate pressure and hopes of domestic economic recovery - both of
which benefit smaller stocks more. But there is a market cycle too: maturing
bull runs often see investment trickling down to benefit smaller companies.
While the trend may be intelligible, it is less certain that it is
justified. The domestic recovery will be weak, so that the higher hopes for
earnings recoveries may not be fulfilled. Dividend cover is also low and
there are plenty of nasty surprises still to work their way through from the
recession. On the other hand the gathering US recovery and rising dollar
will particularly benefit blue chip stocks. Their balance sheets and
dividend cover are also stronger, giving them the better dividend growth
prospects.
Inevitably there are some smaller companies which will do well, and the
heavily depressed share prices through the recession mean that there will be
some substantial rebounds. But the 13 per cent rise in the FT-A Contracting
and Construction sector in December smacks of indiscriminate buying, when
stock selection is all.

<TEXT>
Talks about building jumbo jets to seat 600 may be a pleasant distraction
from British Aerospace's current problems, but it will be a long time before
the market really cares. Investor attention is focused on whether the new
management has the beef to cut costs and resolve the uncertainties
surrounding the company. Indeed, the collapse of earnings in 1992 and
questions over the size of any dividend payment, left very little else to
hang on to. Some progress is clearly being made. The European fighter
aircraft will be built, albeit late. And BAe's share of the work may rise if
other partners reduce their commitments. Negotiations with Taiwan on
regional jets continue and seem likely to produce a positive result soon. If
the deal is signed it may not bring in as much cash as hoped, but it will at
least prove that the management can put out a bad fire. Overall, BAe's
problem is high costs, not low revenues, so the broad cost-reduction
programme should bear fruit.
The biggest remaining question mark is over the Al Yamamah deal with Saudi
Arabia, but that is largely outside the company's control. Airbus production
may also slow, while smaller headaches like turboprop aircraft and property
remain to be tackled. Yet with some faith that the management has plugged
the hole, investors can begin to look towards earnings in 1993 of some
Pounds 150m. Not much on Pounds 10bn of turnover, but the recovery story is
beginning to emerge.

FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Laporte/Evode
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For students of the takeover game, the tussle for Evode is turning into a
minor classic. After quietly stalking its prey for seven years, Laporte
slickly pitched in yesterday with a tentative promise of a recommended bid.
It promptly demonstrated its resolve by buying 6.1 per cent of Evode's
shares in the market at Pounds 1 apiece. In so doing, it seemingly scuppered
the chances for Wassall, which had just declared a revised final offer of
95p a share. Such an agile operator must have been greatly galled to be so
comprehensively outmanoeuvred.
Laporte's shareholders will certainly admire the timing. Whether they so
appreciate the move's financial sense is a different matter. Much will
depend on the structuring of any deal. With year-end borrowings of around
Pounds 120m and gearing of 45 per cent, Laporte will be strapped to offer
much cash. A rights issue or a share swap with a partial cash alternative
seems the most likely approach. Laporte has stipulated that any offer will
have to enhance earnings in its first year. This leaves little room for
error, assuming a fair premium will be necessary for a mainly paper bid.
Laporte may have a stiff task convincing investors of the speed of the
rationalisation benefits.
That still leaves room for complications which might induce Laporte to walk
away, leaving Wassall with a clear run. Wassall will probably refrain from
entering a bidding battle. Evode's shareholders must be left smiling - if
not silently wondering why their hitherto unfashionable company has suddenly
become the object of such desire.

FT  06 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Franc exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the French franc is getting tough. Yesterday's Franco-German
declaration of determination to defend the existing parity and the 2
percentage point rise in overnight French interest rates were a pre-emptive
strike against the speculators. The measures display a sophistication - and
admittedly a level of international collaboration - which was conspicuously
absent during the UK's vain attempt to defend sterling last September. Yet
the stakes have also been raised, perhaps rashly when the Bundesbank is
still deeply reluctant to cut official lending rates.
Together with talk of independence for the Banque de France and a closer
bilateral monetary relationship, yesterday's moves have bought a little more
time. The two sides will have to continue pulling such tricks out of the hat
for several weeks, though, until domestic German conditions warrant a cut in
rates. Ultimately that may prove impossible. The Bundesbank would then have
to decide whether to cut rates anyway or risk seeing the ERM collapse. Its
decision would be easier if Bonn were to act on the budget. This may become
a focus of political pressure from European partners anxious for lower rates
but aware of the futility of leaning on the Bundesbank directly.
The French equity market was curiously unperturbed by yesterday's rate rise.
It may be signalling an expectation that lower French rates will be the
outcome whatever happens to the currency. Either the Bundesbank or the franc
will soon have to give way. The UK's position above the fray helped sterling
rise above DM2.50. That has its negative side. The Treasury has no appetite
for lower base rates, but a stronger pound is eroding the monetary
relaxation on which 1993 recovery hopes are predicated.

With lawyers having filled most of the Clinton administration's top economic
posts, the hopes of professional economists are now pinned on the crucial
second round of sub-cabinet appointments.
The really attractive unfilled posts are the undersecretaryships for
international and economic affairs in the Treasury and State departments -
posts held in the Bush administration by David Mulford and Robert Zoellick,
respectively.
However, there is also a vacancy at the new White House National Economic
Council where ex-Goldman Sachs boss Robert Rubin badly needs a high-powered
economic assistant if he is to carry any international clout.
Passed over for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers, World
Bank chief economist Larry Summers appears a strong runner for Mulford's
Treasury job, which would make him the administration's point man in Group
of Seven policy co-ordination exercises.
Then again, David Hale, chief economist at Chicago's Kemper Financial
Services and omnipresent on the international lecture circuit, would dearly
love a crack at it.
Stanley Fischer of MIT (Summers's predecessor at the World Bank) is
reportedly running hard for Zoellick's job at State, which will carry
responsibility for fashioning a coherent US response to economic chaos in
the former Soviet republics. However, Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs, currently an
adviser to the Yeltsin government, could be an imaginative alternative.
Elsewhere Larry Katz, a bright young labour economist at Harvard, is
expected to land the chief economist post at Robert Reich's Department of
Labor - a big job given Clinton's determination to overhaul US industrial
training, and Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and Business Week
columnist, is set to become one of Laura Tyson's deputies at the Council of
Economic Advisers.
Blinder's appointment should help balance Tyson's unconventional views on
trade and industrial policy.

The extra angst visible on the faces of Zurich citizens this week is not
only the result of worry about possible isolation from the rest of Europe.
More likely the cause is ice-layers - both the public and the city's clocks
have been suffering from the current cold snap. Probably no city in the
world has as many clocks; every side of every church spire and every large
intersection is so equipped.
Moreover, the city's public transport authority broadcasts the time to all
trams and buses at irregular intervals. In the past few days, with
temperatures remaining below freezing, some clocks have fared poorly. The
minute hand at Fraumunster cathedral, for example, has a hard time climbing
up to the hour. Some two-faced clocks show different times on each side. It
is all a bit odd considering that Zurich winters are often very cold and the
Swiss are supposed to be expert clock-makers. Perhaps they should seek help
from the Japanese.

When a troubled construction company makes its personnel director redundant,
one might well think that the only people left on the premises are the

But Higgs &amp; Hill stresses that Stephen Schneider, who has resigned as a

half over the past three years that he had worked himself out of a job.
In future the P45s will be issued by a more lowly official without a seat on
the Higgs &amp; Hill board. Even so, it suggests a topsy-turvy sense of

FT  06 JAN 93 / Observer: Signature trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's habit of precipitating dramatic resignations over absurd events
seems to be becoming a disease. Yesterday the presiding judge at the trial
of Erich Honecker was forced to quit - for asking for an autograph.
As if the weekend resignation of Jurgen Mollemann as economics minister were
not enough - he was guilty of using his ministerial notepaper to promote a
plastic token invented by a distant relative - the dismissal of Hansgeorg
Brautigam from the bench in Berlin's criminal court number 700 surely takes
the prize.
The whole affair of the Honecker trial, at which the grim and grey dictator
of the former East Germany stands accused of murder - for ordering his
soldiers to shoot at his citizens trying to flee across the Berlin Wall - is
rapidly turning into a tragi-comic chapter of accidents.
Brautigam has been fighting a stern battle to keep the case going in the
face of mounting evidence that the 80-year-old Honecker will die of liver
cancer long before any verdict can be reached. He has rejected a string of
efforts by the defence to have it called off.
Yesterday they finally succeeded in proving he was 'biased'. He was found
guilty, by a panel of fellow judges, of asking for an autograph from
Honecker on behalf of a curious juror, and then pretending he had done
nothing of the sort.
Already, two co-defendants have been stood down from trial on the grounds of
incapacity. The question remains whether a case billed as the most
spectacular political trial since Nuremberg can survive this latest
indignity.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Franc besieged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW year begins where the old one left off, with a tug of war over the
French franc. On one side are investors increasingly doubtful about the
ability of any French government to sustain interest rates at current
levels. On the other side is the French political establishment, aided at
least rhetorically by the German.
As the pull from the markets has increased, so has the need to pull still
more strongly on the other side. Yesterday, therefore, the Banque de France
temporarily replaced its five-to-10 day lending at an interest rate of 10
per cent by an overnight rate of 12 per cent. More significantly, the
Bundesbank and the Banque de France said that they 'will pursue their close
co-operation in order to ensure the proper functioning of the ERM', this
being an apparently stronger statement than the one released last September.
As important was the commitment by Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, to
an independent Banque de France, which creates a consensus on this policy
among the respectable French parties.
The question is whether the authorities have done enough.
Interest rate increases are not particularly effective even in a country
that is able to shield the bulk of borrowers from the effects of higher
rates in the money markets. When the problem created by the exchange rate
link is excessively high interest rates, any battle won by still higher
rates would, think the markets, not be worth winning. But by thinking this,
investors ensure it is true.
The Bundesbank's commitment is far more important. At the limit the
Bundesbank can guarantee the exchange rate, though that would threaten
domestic monetary control. Whether it would go that far is at least dubious.
But the possibility that it might will give people who are selling the
French franc short pause for thought.
Commitment to an independent central bank increases the credibility of the
current policy, by making it easier to believe that the French authorities
will keep interest rates up for longer. But it also makes the alternatives
more palatable. Should the franc be forced to float, for example, central
bank independence would increase the likelihood of its remaining strong. An
independent Banque de France would also increase the chance of German
acceptance of early monetary union as an alternative to disarray.
This then is a good try by the Franco-German authorities. But it will not be
enough on its own to ensure the present parity. What is needed for this is
confidence that German monetary policy will soon be eased. No statement,
certainly no statement by the French authorities, can create such
confidence. But they have done what they can to win the present tug-of-war
and have made the fall-back positions more attractive as well.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Personal View: Short-term view of broadcasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy on broadcasting is a fine example of short-termism.
It has made clear, since the green paper on the future of the BBC was
published in November, that it is in favour of retaining the licence fee
when the BBC's charter is renewed in 1996. Its motive is clearly to avoid
the controversy that would result from implementing the decision eventually
to replace the licence fee with subscription, announced in the 1988 white
paper on broadcasting in the 1990s. It has also showed that it has rejected
advertising, the alternative source of finance to subscription, by the terms
of the new franchises for the ITV network.
As the government stated in the 1988 white paper, the licence fee will
become harder to sustain as new television services proliferate, and as the
BBC's share of the market declines. The number of new services will have
multiplied by 1996, and still more before the new charter expires in 2011.
Forecasts of the BBC's future share of the market can be little better than
guesswork, but we can be sure that its share will fall as more alternatives
become available. Collecting the licence fee must become more difficult and
more unpopular as fewer viewers watch the BBC; long before 2011, the
politicians in power will have to face the need to replace the licence fee.
The case for moving from the licence fee to new sources of finance is not
only that the licence fee will become unsustainable but that it represents
an inequitable and inefficient method of financing a TV service. It is
inequitable because it tries to force viewers to pay for the BBC whether
they want to or not, and because it levies the same charge on all viewers,
irrespective of their means.
The licence fee is inefficient because it gives viewers no means of
influencing the content of the programmes they are shown - a feature that
seems to be regarded as a virtue by proponents of the BBC who endow its
staff with the ability to supply viewers with programmes which they do not
know that they want but which will improve their lives and society. This
seems a vice to those who believe that individuals know best which
programmes will most benefit them.
Television can have a strictly educational role, which the government may
finance; it can also bring the arts to people who would not otherwise have
access to them, and the government might subsidise such programmes. But
there are dangers to democracy in a broadcasting organisation that believes
it can improve people; it may also try to influence political beliefs. A
service that relies on the government for its funds must be susceptible to
political pressure; the BBC is unlikely to do anything to offend the
government until the terms of its new charter are fixed, and it would become
more vulnerable to political pressure if the licence fee became more
unpopular.
The likely decline in the BBC's share of viewing must raise doubts about its
ability to finance the present scale of service from subscription alone.
While the size of any broadcasting system should reflect the demand for its
services, in a libertarian society where the individual consumer is
sovereign, the BBC would be unduly handicapped in competing with other
services if it was barred from taking advertisements. In the long term this
should be feasible without weakening the existing advertising-financed
services in Britain, if the Treasury could be induced to surrender some of
its gains from the recent changes to the ITV franchising system.
The Peacock Committee had recommended in 1986 that franchises should be
awarded by competitive tendering, to reduce the profits and to squeeze the
costs of the ITV companies, but it envisaged that some of the proceeds
should be used to finance public service broadcasting. In the event, the new
ITV contractors will pay Pounds 250m more than their predecessors in 1993,
but all of it has been swallowed by the Treasury. This sum represents nearly
30 per cent of the BBC's expenditure on television services. With some
growth in advertising revenue and some willingness by the Treasury to reduce
the levies, advertising could represent a significant part of the BBC's
future income.
The terms on which the BBC's charter is renewed in 1996 should follow from
the recommendations of the Peacock Committee and the policies described in
the white paper of 1988; the financial objective should be to replace the
licence fee by subscription, but the BBC should also be given greater
commercial freedom than envisaged in these documents. The overriding
objective, however, should be to make the BBC wholly independent of
government, so that it could never be used as a political tool.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Brazil's third way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL HAD a horrible 1992. It lost a president on corruption charges and
perhaps its position as the world's ninth largest economy to China. It
suffered zero growth, annual inflation of 1,200 per cent, three-digit real
interest rates and a budget deficit equal to two-fifths of economic output.
President Itamar Franco, who took over three months ago from the deposed
Fernando Collor, wants to make job creation a priority and to attack poverty
through a sharp increase in the minimum wage. Officials talk of boosting
government spending on infrastructure, health and education.
There is no doubting the importance of rebuilding infrastructure, improving
public services and alleviating poverty in Brazil. The problem is that a
government without financial resources cannot begin to address these issues.
This is why, although he may not realise it, fiscal reform should be Mr
Franco's priority. Only through such reform will the budget deficit be
closed, inflation subdued, interest rates lowered and confidence restored.
Without it, Mr Franco's plans to better the lot of the poor and restart
growth will be lost in an inflationary fog.
Brazil's Congress has a chance at a special session next week to introduce
long-overdue fiscal reform. This will not produce a long-term solution,
which must await fundamental constitutional changes later this year. If Mr
Franco spends the money rather than closing the deficit, it will not even
offer short-term relief.
Fiscal reform is by no means the answer to all Brazil's problems, but the
example of the rest of Latin America should be enough to convince Brazil's
politicians that it is a necessary start.
Despite this, there still seems a view in the Brazilian elite that Brazil
need not heed the lessons of its neighbours, which have pursued freer, more
open markets and balanced budgets, and should seek a 'third way' to solve
its economic woes. But even a third way would require the country to
generate growth through efficient investment. That would require a taming of
inflation, and a curbing of the budget deficit. In other words, there is no
escape from the central, tough decision.
Tough decisions are hard in Brazil's diffuse political system. The 1988
constitution, fashioned as a reaction to 21 years of military rule, so
surrounds the government with checks and balances that only in unusual
circumstances can it rule effectively. Mr Franco had such a rare opportunity
when he took office, enjoying huge support in Congress and in the
population. It is to be hoped that he has not already missed it.
It is often said that the reason that Brazil has never tackled its economic
malaise is because, unlike in neighbouring countries, its problems have
never got bad enough. There is an unpleasant risk that 1993 will be the year
in which this state of affairs changes.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Airbus hits crosswinds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVELATION that Boeing is in talks with half of the Airbus consortium
about developing a super-jumbo airliner should make the governments of
Europe sit up and take notice. Airbus is the EC's most successful example of
state-sponsored industrial planning. The Boeing deal could threaten its
ultimate dissolution. It would also raise questions of competition on a
global scale, since the proposed new consortium could end up as monopoly
supplier to the top end of the world market.
The deal might be blocked by the competition authorities on either side of
the Atlantic, since US or EC airlines would have a reduced choice of
supplier. But it is conceivable that a product with development costs of
Dollars 10bn is a natural monopoly, on the grounds that the market is not
big enough to support duplication of effort. Indeed, perhaps only a
transatlantic consortium of the type proposed could undertake it. If so, to
block the deal would be to deny the market the product. It might thus be
sensible to allow the consortium to proceed and submit it to some kind of
global regulation.
The separate question then arises of why such a consortium should not
involve Airbus as a whole, rather than only two of its members. It is
perhaps too early to rule that out. If Boeing secures the agreement of the
German and British partners, there will be considerable pressure on the
French and Spanish partners to fall into line. This would have the effect of
introducing US influence into a showcase EC project. But if Airbus's
partners are already breaking ranks, the alternative might be the ultimate
demise of almost the only serious competitor Boeing faces on the world
stage.
But other steps are needed as well. The apparent willingness of the British
and German partners to consider throwing their lot in with Boeing shows how
urgent it is that Airbus's shaky structure should be strengthened. In
particular, it is high time that Airbus moved forward to the status of a
conventional public company. The French government, which is a partner
through its ownership of Aerospatiale, might not relish its new status as a
mere minority shareholder. But to the extent that Airbus is an irrational
structure, it is the fault of governments. It is the job of governments to
sort it out.
Whether Airbus deserves nurturing as a beacon of EC industrial policy is a
more debatable question. The EC is not alone in identifying aerospace as one
of the key industrial growth areas of the future. Ultimately, though, it is
no more sensible to lose money in a growing market than in a declining one.
Airbus has been a huge drain on public funds for years, and its finances
remain opaque. If it is to serve as an example of industrial policy, the
minimum requirement is that it should make the kind of profits appropriate
to a public company. Not the least argument for a conventional corporate
structure is that taxpayers would be provided with published accounts to
help them judge that for themselves.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Seducer eyes a double prize: Boeing's approach to Airbus
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Europe's most successful cross-border industrial partnership
is under threat.
By luring two of the main partners in the European Airbus consortium to
study the joint Dollars 10bn development of a new 550-800 seat super jumbo
airliner, Boeing is attempting to consolidate its own global dominance of
the civil aircraft market by driving a wedge between the four Airbus
shareholders.
The US company, which controls a 55-60 per cent share of the world airliner
market, yesterday confirmed it was close to signing an agreement with
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and possibly also with British Aerospace - two of
the four Airbus partners, which also include Aerospatiale of France and Casa
of Spain - to study the development of a super jumbo.
Although Airbus officials sought to play down the implications of the Boeing
move by suggesting discussions with Dasa and BAe were only at an
'exploratory stage', the outcome of any agreement is bound to have a
profound impact on the European aircraft industry. It could lead to a
radical realignment of the entire commercial aerospace sector.
'Boeing is clearly trying to seduce some of the Airbus partners with strong
north American aspirations in an effort to destabilise the consortium which
has now become its main competitor,' said an executive of one Airbus
partner.
Mr John Hayhurst, vice-president of large aircraft development at Boeing,
said the Seattle company had initiated discussions with Dasa over the super
jumbo last year. Boeing is also discussing future supersonic aircraft
development with the German company, part of the Daimler-Benz group, and has
already agreed to exchange some engineers with Dasa.
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, is expected to warn his
partners today, during his traditional new year presentation of the
consortium's prospects, of the risks of undermining Airbus at a particularly
delicate stage in its evolution.
Over the past 20 years, Airbus has developed a broad family of aircraft, has
captured 26 per cent of the world market, and is now starting to make
inroads in the big long-distance airliner market, traditionally dominated by
the Boeing 747, with its new A330/A340 widebody jets which will be delivered
to their first airline customers later this year. But if some of the Airbus
partners are tempted into joint development projects with Boeing, it could
seriously undermine Airbus's own longer-term aircraft development projects.
Airbus, like Boeing, has also been studying the development of a 600-seat
jumbo. It has already approached the big three Japanese aerospace
manufacturers - Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - to become risk-sharing partners in a super
jumbo project.
'The design and development of this giant aircraft represents the next big
challenge in commercial aviation,' said Mr Adam Brown, the Airbus director
of planning. The biggest demand for such an aircraft will come from the
fast-growing Asia-Pacific air transport market, according to Mr Brown,
making it all the more attractive for Japanese and other Asian manufacturers
to participate in the studies and development of a super jumbo. Both Airbus
and Boeing believe such an aircraft could be in regular airline service
early next century.
The problem for Airbus is not only that it is having to adapt to the
recession in the airliner market, scaling back production and rescheduling
aircraft deliveries of financially strapped airline and leasing company
customers. It is also contending with the conflicting ambitions of its
partner companies and their national governments.
The current system on which the consortium is based - a French partnership
called 'Groupement d'Interest Economique' (GIE) - has also made it more
difficult for Airbus to control its own future as all strategic decisions
must first be approved by a supervisory board of representatives of the four
partner companies. Plans to transform Airbus into a public limited company
have been put on ice. But the latest strategic manoeuvres in the industry
could now renew the impetus for such a change.
Boeing's move is not the first time US manufacturers have sought to unsettle
European efforts to establish a strong commercial aerospace industry. Since
the 1960s, US companies have regularly offered to co-operate with European
manufacturers whenever the Europeans have sought to develop a new aircraft
product.
When in the 1960s Sud-Aviation, now part of the French Aerospatiale group,
was considering developing the Caravelle, McDonnell Douglas discussed
co-operation but went on to develop its own, and much more successful DC-9
jet.
When Airbus was planning to develop a shorter version of its A300 widebody
jet in the 1970s, Boeing tried to persuade British Aerospace to co-operate
in development of its 757 twin-engine airliner.
Like Airbus, Boeing is not in a position to develop on its own a new
double-decker super jumbo aircraft at a cost of Dollars 10bn or more. The US
manufacturer is currently in the process of developing a new widebody
aircraft, the 777, and is also addressing the issue of renewing other
products in its range. These include the smaller 737 narrowbody jet which
competes against the newer Airbus A320.
Boeing has relied on the big three Japanese manufacturers as important
partners on projects such as the 777 and the 767. But Boeing, which has also
discussed Japanese participation in its super jumbo feasibility studies, has
been reluctant to give the Japanese companies an equity or profit-sharing
role in its programmes. Boeing has clearly been unhappy over Airbus attempts
to forge a close relationship with the Japanese manufacturers.
Boeing's Mr Hayhurst believes there will be room for only one super jumbo
programme. By attempting to secure the support of both Dasa and BAe, two
companies keen on expanding their presence in the US, Boeing is seeking to
steal a march on its European rival.
It has timed its move carefully and cunningly, taking advantage of a moment
when moves towards greater European political and economic unity are under
strain and the European aerospace industry is undergoing a new restructuring
phase. The fact that two of the four Airbus partners are even considering
collaboration with Boeing is a sign that the Airbus partnership may be
starting to waver.

FT  06 JAN 93 / What we should have done: Western governments must learn
from their failures in Yugoslavia to prevent similar tragedies elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone must be hoping 1993 will be less of an annus horribilis than 1992.
But in terms of war and destruction in eastern Europe it could well be
worse, unless western governments drastically improve their performance. To
help them, I have drawn up a list of actions by which they might have
averted successive tragedies in Yugoslavia, had they taken them at the right
time.
Early 1991. The EC could have informed all parties that (a) it would give no
further assistance to Yugoslavia until the six republics had all agreed on a
new democratic constitution (presumably a confederal one); and (b) it would
not recognise or assist any republic that unilaterally seceded. (But most
west European leaders were not thinking about Yugoslavia then. They were
preoccupied with the Gulf war.)
June-July 1991. When the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) began military
operations against Slovenia, the EC could have responded by according
immediate diplomatic recognition to that republic, while warning the
Croatian government it could only expect the same support if it reached a
power-sharing agreement with the Serb minority. Autumn 1991. The EC and the
international community as a whole should have responded much more firmly to
JNA and Serb attacks on Croatia, notably by imposing an oil embargo and
using naval power to stop the bombardment of Dubrovnik and other coastal
towns.
January 1992. The Twelve should have withheld recognition of Croatia until
the conditions set the previous month on constitutional freedoms and
minority rights were fully satisfied. They should not have called for a
referendum in Bosnia-Hercegovina, but should have made it clear they would
recognise that republic as independent only when it had a constitution
agreed between the elected leaders of all three communities. Similarly, they
should not have quibbled about the name of Macedonia, but made recognition
of it conditional on a power-sharing agreement between its Slav and Albanian
communities.
Spring-summer 1992. Having recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent
state and admitted it to the UN, other states should have come to its
assistance. They were not obliged to intervene directly in the Bosnian civil
war, but the UN Security Council could have ordered Serbia, Montenegro and
Croatia to stay out of it. Those three republics could have been told to
take effective steps, under UN supervision, to prevent armed men, weapons or
strategic supplies from going into Bosnia; and if they refused could have
been subjected to serious economic sanctions, enforced strictly from the
start, on land, sea and river. More should have been done, and sooner, to
help Mr Milan Panic and other pro-peace politicians get their message across
to the Serbian electorate.
Alternatively, if western powers were unable or unwilling to protect Bosnia
from external interference, at very least they should have allowed the
government they had recognised, and the Moslem community from which it drew
its main support, to obtain weapons to defend themselves against aggressors
who were already heavily armed and extremely ruthless.
Summer-autumn 1992. Having recognised Bosnia-Hercegovina but failed to
defend it, and helped thereby to bring about the civil war and determine its
course, western powers must be considered morally responsible for the
appalling fate that befell the Moslem population. They were, therefore - and
in my judgment are still - under a moral obligation to intervene directly to
save that population, securing it in a 'safe haven' as they had done the
Kurds of northern Iraq the previous year. That would not have solved the
political problem, but would at least have given the victims a space in
which to survive while a political solution was sought.
Instead, the west has contented itself with half measures. Grudgingly and
belatedly it has sent in troops, under UN command, to try to ensure that
supplies reach what is left of the beleaguered civilian population. But it
has failed to face up to the logic of this intervention. If troops are
needed to get supplies through, it is because unescorted supplies are
subject to obstruction. Sending troops therefore implies a will to confront
the obstructors; yet that will seems to be lacking.
It is futile to talk of 'enforcing' the no-fly zone and simultaneously of
'avoiding confrontation'. Enforcement implies confrontation: you cannot have
one without the other. In their desperation to avoid this unpleasant fact,
western leaders resort to absurd alternatives such as the proposal to cut
off telecommunications with Serbia - which would only help Mr Slobodan
Milosevic to keep the Serbian people isolated in his private world of
paranoid fantasy.
The anxiety of British and other ministers about endangering the lives of
their troops, or 'getting sucked into a quagmire', is understandable. But
was it necessary to advertise this anxiety at every stage, thereby relieving
the Serb leaders of fears about the consequences of their actions?
This has given to them, and to other nationalist leaders throughout the
region, the idea that their best hope of reaching a satisfactory 'solution'
to their problems is to impose a swift fait accompli, relying on the west's
reluctance to intervene, and make it irreversible as fast as they can. If Mr
Milosevic and his allies have so far refrained from attempting an 'ethnic
cleansing' of Albanians from Kosovo, it is surely because they are already
militarily overstretched and because, even for them, getting rid of 90 per
cent of the population appears a daunting task, rather than because they
fear an effective western reaction.
And it is not only they who are drawing conclusions. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the
Slovak leader, has already adopted the fait accompli strategy by building
the Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, in defiance of neighbouring Hungary. He
will no doubt do the same in quelling any opposition from the Hungarian
minority within Slovakia. But who is to say that Hungarian nationalists, on
their side, will not take a leaf out of his book? Some of them can already
be heard arguing that, since Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have now both
dissolved, the frontiers Hungary had to concede to them in 1919 are no
longer sacrosanct and the Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and Vojvodina
(northern Serbia) should no longer be left outside their motherland.
Similar arguments are being used by Russian nationalists eager to help their
compatriots left behind in other ex-Soviet republics, and by the leaders of
some of those republics to justify discrimination against Russians, whom
they see as the potential fifth column of a new Russian expansionism.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen have done well to produce a peace plan for
Bosnia-Hercegovina that looks workable, and even better to focus the world's
attention, at last, on the central issue: the insistence of the Serb leaders
on wielding exclusive sovereignty in the areas they control. But it is
important to understand that their plan only looks workable because it takes
account of 'new realities', and thereby in a sense ratifies the methods by
which those realities were brought about. For nothing can reverse the
destruction of towns and villages accompanied by mass murder and other
atrocities. Even if the actual buildings are rebuilt, the atmosphere of
unthinking trust in which different ethnic communities once lived
intermingled is impossible to restore.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: University pretenders face squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr WILLIAM OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your confidence ('University challenge', January 5) that an expanded,
better equipped further education service will serve only to produce
thousands of qualified entrants for the 'new universities' to choose from is
misplaced.
Colleges of further and higher education have many advantages. Most staff
are as well qualified as their 'new university' counterparts; the colleges
are within travelling distance of the customers' homes; they offer academic
and vocational qualifications; and at many, a student can start at the
lowest level and go through to degree and beyond.
Given that the 'boom' in student applications will continue as long as this
level of unemployment is with us, the news that numbers going into higher
education are to be limited while further education is to be expanded will
be the green light for the more forward-looking college managements.
Colleges will recruit and hang on to their students and, while the real
universities will still attract their share of customers, the squeeze will
be on for the pretenders.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: Abolish housing subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK ANTROBUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with amazement recent government proposals to encourage the
private rented housing sector. That the rented sector needs encouragement is
all too clear. But a government which still claims to believe in free
markets is in effect now considering the introduction of a serious market
distortion to compensate for another - involving moreover the spending of
billions of pounds.
The private rented sector has been crowded out largely by the need for
private landlords to charge high rents. This results from the inflation of
house prices and the need to set rents which will provide an adequate return
on capital.
The fall in house prices is therefore to be welcomed, but to ensure a
permanently lower level of house prices and to remove the distortion in
favour of owner-occupation, the government should abolish mortgage interest
tax relief.
This subsidy can be abolished with immediate effect for everyone who took
out their mortgage before Black Wednesday, as the reduction in interest
rates since then more than offsets the removal of this subsidy in most
cases.
The resulting long-term reduction in house prices would be good news too for
private buyers and providers of housing for social renting. If funds are
available I suggest a means-tested but generous housing benefit available to
both renters and buyers.

Sir, President-elect Clinton's plans for introducing voluntary national
service ('Citizens corps to the rescue', January 4) was encouraging. It
should make higher education more available to all, improve the workforce's
skills, and help to create a community spirit. The sadness is that none of
the three UK political parties has yet decided to emulate Clinton.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: BNFL confident that Thorp plant will be unwrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN R S GUINNESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader, 'Thorp in trouble' (December 31), you state that
British Nuclear Fuels must fear that its Thorp plant is a Christmas present
it will never unwrap. Not true. BNFL would only have such fears if we
doubted the professionalism and integrity of the regulatory bodies
concerned, namely Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or if we did not believe in Mr Major's
government's commitment to economic growth, which is incompatible with
turning Britain's second largest industrial project into this country's
largest white elephant.
As we entertain neither proposition, we remain confident that we shall
obtain the necessary authorisations from HMIP and Maff to enable this
environmentally sound project, with its Pounds 9bn of firm advance orders,
to start up.
Could I correct three factual points in your editorial. First, contrary to
the misinformation put out by Greenpeace, which it has agreed not to repeat,
there is no credible risk of our German or Japanese customers withdrawing
from their contracts. On the contrary, the chairmen of the two German
utilities claimed by Greenpeace to be considering their position have
written to me to confirm that they intend to honour their contracts.
Second, BNFL has not suggested the decommissioning costs of Thorp will be
Pounds 1.2bn, but rather Pounds 750m in 1989 money or about Pounds 900m in
January 1993 money.
Third, we have repeatedly made it clear that these decommissioning costs
will be fully written off over the first 10 years of Thorp's life. We expect
the plant to be in operation for at least 20 years and, as in the case of
BNFL's Magnox power stations, it could well be profitably extended further.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: Ruff universe theory may be a cut above the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The missing mass in the universe is indeed an intriguing mystery. As
one who tried to tie up all of 1992's loose ends in the time between
Christmas and the new year, I turned to this more tractable problem and came
up with a much simpler idea than the invisible matter explanations suggested
by Clive Cookson ('Mystery of missing mass', December 29).
Imagine that our familiar three dimensions could somehow be squashed down on
to the two dimensions of a gigantic strip of lace and then elegantly bent
back and forth to make an enormous Elizabethan ruff. And suppose that light
and matter could not leave the ruff's surface but gravity could. Then in any
two-dimensional locality where not much matter was present, one might still
feel some big gravitational effect from bodies in a neighbouring ruffle.
In fact, depending on the closeness of ruffles, inhabitants of this crinkly
universe might experience many times the gravitational pull they would
expect from observing within the ruff's surface the density of matter.
Mr Cookson tells us that astronomers observe precisely this of our
unsquashed universe. So perhaps there is no need to squash our universe down
and fold it up to get crinkliness. Perhaps, rather, the fact that we observe
extra gravitational attraction in space is evidence that our universe is
already crinkled up in some fourth dimension.
What else? Could black holes be points where the 'lace' of one 'ruffle'
touches the next? Could the Great Wall simply be a manifestation of
crinkliness on a gigantic scale? Ingenious explanations for all sorts of
observed cosmic irregularities and singularities might follow.
Perhaps crinkliness occurs at several different scales. Could that explain
why quanta - which always seemed rather arbitrary to me - appear as bitty as
they do?
But the real appeal of crinkliness as an idea is that, if true, we are much
closer to other planets and galaxies than our conventional geometries tell
us we are. Until now, it has been depressing to think that the stars are
utterly beyond our practical reach. It would be wonderful if there were
short cuts - jumping from one ruffle to the next, so to speak - so that, in
due course, like the USS Enterprise, spaceships might carry man great
distances across space.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Lots of of blood in the soap dish - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As you may have gathered, one way of starting the new year at a serious
social disadvantage is not to have seen The Vampyr, BBC 2's soap opera cum
blood-bath set in the luxury apartments and river frontages of Docklands.
Unhappy creature, you missed the quintet of the car-wash attendants whose
line, 'London Transport makes me sick', rhymed not just with 'quick', but
also with 'prick'.
You also missed the socialites' black sabbath among the stuffed fish in the
Saatchi Gallery, not to mention the soprano aria with synchronised swimming
in the penthouse pool . . . And what good puns there were as the vampire,
woken by a bulldozer from three centuries of slumber in a subterranean
Docklands drain, profitted from a 'cut-throat climate' to join the property
developers and sink his teeth into their bimbo girl-friends and offspring.
But before you collapse from terminal regret, an omnibus edition of The
Vampyr will be shown on Saturday at 9.55 on BBC2. The rest of us saw it
screened as five half-hour episodes culminating last Sunday evening when, to
a hushed chorus of 'Jeeee-sus Christ]', the stunned Sloanes congregated for
a society wedding saw a cross plummet into the evil heart of Ripley the
Vampyr. Cue for baritone Omar Ebrahim to sprout his fangs again and for yet
another tidal wave of blood to engulf our screens.
The Vampyr is an adaptation (musically faithful, I am told) of an opera
written in 1828 by Heinrich Marschner, a Bohemian born lawyer who throve
when he turned to the opera business. According to Grove's, Marschner had a
hand in the formation of Wagner, although to judge from this opera it was
more like a finger-nail. So it was not great music, although the overture
recurring nightly as the theme tune has since proved horribly hummable.
Janet Street-Porter and Nigel Finch produced and directed this magnificent
exercise in operatic overkill, with Charles Hart (responsible for Aspects of
Love) as librettist. As a fan of Opera Factory, I was delighted to detect
everywhere the hand of another collaborator, the wonderfully inventive David
Freeman.
It may be that The Vampyr will lose something in its omnibus version. After
all, part of the joke was seeing how neatly a rather unremarkable
19th-century opera can adapt to being seen in instalments. I also wonder
whether a fizzing cocktail of sex and gore (did you notice the wonderful
canapes shaped like eyeballs at the gallery reception?) would be quite so
funny swallowed at one go. Too much blood in the soap-dish just might begin
to pall.
It was an interesting week on TV for property developers with an interest in
both Docklands and the City. In its first week of taking over the ITV
franchise, Carlton TV launched A Day in the Life (Tuesday 7.30), a series in
which Desmond Wilcox visits London landmarks. This week's portrait to
Docklands gave a voice to some of the local critics of London's 'great white
hope'. However, in the main it was a blandly appreciative picture of a
development project which in my view, produces the 1980s version of Devil's
Island.
Just before the ferociously efficient Docklands PR lobby hits the phone, I
wish to make clear that my views are not those of the carping section of the
Press castigated on the film for knocking a place it has never seen.
Admittedly, my two year stint in developing Docklands was before the
kayak-club opened.
We met a cross-section of Docklands folk, from hyper-enthusiastic PR
consultant Sunny Crouch to the ladies in the bingo-circle. Star turns were
gnarled old dockers and stevedores, who pick crops of beans in well-manured
allotments (pity I never found the Mud Flats riding school) and yarn about
the past. The 'place of huge dreams' began to look far less of a nightmare:
memo for 1993, to board the Docklands Light Railway for another trip east.
Meanwhile, as Canary Wharf was a-building, the City of London was looking
over her shoulder in a state of high, yet as it turned out, unjustified,
anxiety. Masters of the Universe (BBC 2; Saturday) was much cleverer and
more compelling than if it had been just another architectural ding-dong
about what went right or wrong in the 1980s building boom in the City.
Brilliantly filmed, with just the right dose of tricksiness, this was a
documentary which made one see what it might have been like to have been a
major player in the transformation - or was it a rape - of the Square Mile.
Were they heroes or villains, the men who changed the skyline, built over
roads and stations? One thing which emerged loud and clear was that the
architects were merely the handmaidens to a process conceived and shaped by
an alliance between planners and developers. Next time you sit next to an
architect at dinner (spot him by the designer suit which has seen far, far
better days), do remember that he is not responsible.
Beside models of some of the largest buildings this country has seen, Leon
Krier brooded over a process which to him marks the impotence of the
architectural profession and a profound failure to understand the way people
want to live. The tragedy, he argued, was that there was no master plan, no
integration between places to live and places to work.
But then, the key players reply, there just was no the time to hang about,
with Canary Wharf set to ruin the City as a commercial centre. As property
developer David King said, borrowing Pounds 100 million 'is about as heady
an experience as you can have in your lifetime.' Where was the fun in
messing about with a master plan when instead it was possible to be master
of the universe, to have money for the asking and giant buildings to play
with.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Two cheers for the Wigmore Hall - Music in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First, the praises of the renewed Wigmore Hall must be sung. Music-lovers
have missed the place sorely since July last year. The Purcell Room, though
recently much improved, remains a second-best London venue for solo
recitals, chamber music and song (roughly equal with St. John's, Smith
Square, which has different virtues and drawbacks). We never doubted Bill
Lyne's word that the Hall itself would be left sacrosanct - just cleaned,
and freshly re-pointed.
The complementary pleasure is the new cafe-bar-restaurant downstairs,
handsomely designed and comfortable (excellent caterers, too). No Wigmore
regular will think that a 'mere' luxury, remembering the Dante-esque scenes
in the old foyer whenever the house was sold out. There is room, however,
for a seasonal quibble: on the new marketing policy, very few Bob Cratchits
will get into any of the main concerts.
This is because seat-booking is now locked into an elaborate scheme of
priorities. Should there be an artist or a programme that you particularly
want to hear, just being quick off the mark will not be enough - for a large
part of this small hall is reserved, months in advance, for people who have
the time and the money to commit themselves to a whole series of concerts.
Though one can recognise the commercial sense in that, it is hard on anyone
whose time and/or money need careful husbanding.
With the new glamour of the place, I foresee the 'House Full' sign going up
more often than ever, and thriftier music-lovers all but excluded. A thought
which the management might consider for future seasons: what about
persuading the most popular artists to stay on for a second, non-series
recital? There are not a few performers who could fill the hall twice over,
even with the same programme.
As for series that qualify as 'festivals', this year has been notably rich
in them, from the BBC's Alban Berg mini-festival in January to the
Barbican's triumphant celebration of Scandinavian music this month and last.
These affairs get better and better planned, unrecognisably better than the
grab-bags that were billed as 'festivals' just three or four years ago. I
was inclined to be sniffy about them, but they are becoming major
attractions of every season now.
Even the much-reduced Almeida Festival scored effectively with its choice of
new chamber-operas in July, though the concerts were hit-and-miss; and
Andras Schiff's 'Contrasts' series managed to sell a lot of dangerously
recent music to his devoted audience, who are not by nature avant-gardists.
Only the London Sinfonietta, that band of dedicated modernists, has failed
to strike lucky as often as it deserves. For all their canny programming
(their retrospective sweep through past commissions, has been thoroughly
impressive) and reliably brilliant playing, the Queen Elizabeth Hall is
frequently under-filled for them - audiences are enthusiastic, but not
numerous.
It might be the recession; but the most striking thing about public music in
London has been how very many people do keep crowding into the South Bank
halls, the Barbican, the Wigmore, not to mention the opera houses. Music is
a solace, of course] - but compared with New York or Paris or Vienna we
would seem to be wildly over-supplied with it. Yet, apparently, we are not.

Big programme of the night is Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century on
BBC 1 at 9.30. In antiquity, rulers knew about exploiting their images in
metal, stone, or wood. However, James's theory is that with the advent of
the moving camera the nature of fame was profoundly altered. Tonight's
line-up of most famous faces ever includes Charlie Chaplin and Rudolf
Valentino.
Time is running out for Inspector Morse, the man who more than any other
fictional character has put 20th century Oxford on the map. Tonight sees the
first of the final series (ITV, 8.00). The remarkable thing about Morse
(played, I need hardly say, by John Thaw) is that the screen character is so
satisfying, and the chap in Colin Dexter's novels so utterly pedestrian.
In an ironic contrast between youth of today and ..youth of today, you can
start with Def II's Reportage: Screen Generation on BBC 2 at 6.50, and
grieve for the children who become murderous zombies (sorry, I mean
'socially dysfunctional') from too many video games. Then contemplate
serried ranks of well-scrubbed youth in Choir of the Year (BBC 2 at 7.30.)

FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Isabelle Vernet - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The musical year begins well when London's leading recital hall plays host
to a debutant singer of rich, strong vocal talent and personality. I first
encountered Isabelle Vernet at the 1990 Aix-en-Provence Festival; the
following year she gained a host of British admirers during the Cardiff
'Singer of the World' Competition (of which she reached the finals); last
year she sang at the Edinburgh Festival and at the Proms.
On Monday, she came to the Wigmore Hall to offer her first London song
recital: the most searching test, and one passed with honour, if not flying
colours. The young French soprano, pupil of Regine Crespin, has a voice of
striking warmth and individual colours: even in music which seldom called
for full-tilt outpouring, one gained a clear impression of its size and
lyric potential. She approaches the characterisation of each song with
winning directness; she communicates her responses with appealing candour;
she displays uncommon freshness in the act of singing.
Miss Vernet had composed a programme - Faure, Poulenc, Hahn, Duparc, Satie,
Ravel and Manuel Rosenthal - entirely in her native language. In it she
showed a remarkable ability to convey intimacy without ever slipping into
the preciousness and arty miniaturisation that are the bane of French-song
performance. (Her account of Faure's 'En sourdine' attempted, indeed, a
risky full-bloodedness of emotional identification.)
The influence of her great and much-loved teacher is obvious in certain
inflections of word-utterance; but it is an entirely positive influence, and
therefore hardly to be regretted. In comic mode Miss Vernet sparkles: this
likewise has benefited from the adoption of Crespin's elegant wit as its
model.
What at present she seems to lack is absolute security of technique:
cleanliness of line, freedom from breathy impurity in the tone. Too often,
she sang - with vitality and quick-spirited address - words rather than
phrases; too often, little bulges and bumps tended to get in the way of that
unforced legato steadiness which should form the basis of Faure and Duparc
interpretation. There are not so many young French sopranos of this calibre
before the public that one can afford to be sniffy of Miss Vernet's abundant
gifts. Equally, one prays that those gifts will be developed and refined in
the ways they so plainly require.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Diaghilev gems staged in Monaco - Les Ballets de Monte
Carlo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was rather like time-travelling. There, at the week-end, in Charles
Garnier's ravishing little opera house in Monaco, were four gems from the
Diaghilev repertory that had first seen this stage during the palmy years of
the Ballets Russes. Whatever the architectural changes in the principality
since Diaghilev's time - and the Opera House and the Casino, the Hotel de
Paris and the Hermitage, seem the last bastions of the wedding-cake style
that used to gleam everywhere in the sunlight - Monte Carlo is a shrine for
ballet-goers, its name linked to some of the grandest dance achievements.
(During the 1930s the very title was part of an incantation - Les Ballets
Russes de Monte Carlo - that attracted audiences world-wide).
The Russian connection is slightly older than this century, and the shades
of Grand Dukes and jewel-hung ballerinas haunt the theatre - and the casino.
It was to Monaco's credit in the early, golden years of Diaghilev's
enterprise, before the war swept away the Dukes and the diamonds, that the
theatre should have provided a first home for the Ballets Russes; in 1922
Monte Carlo offered a permanent base for Diaghilev's troupe at a time of
financial crisis, and thereafter the balletic connection was to remain
potent.
It is fitting, then, that today's Ballets de Monte Carlo should cast a
backward glance at those prodigious years with a programme of Diaghilev
works: Les Sylphides, Firebird, L'Apres-midi d'un faune, and Le Spectre de
la rose, which had its very first performance at the Opera House. The
stagings, as I saw them on Saturday and Sunday, were careful, albeit
differing in certain accretions and emendations from the texts we know here
(which are owed to members of Diaghilev's troupe, and which I find
preferable). They have been decently mounted, and their scores sounded very
well indeed from the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte Carlo under David
Garforth's baton.
In matter of dancing, performances were for the most part dutiful rather
than inspired. Among the women soloists, Joelle Boulogne offered a delicacy
of means which was most pleasing in Les Sylphides and for the Young Girl in
Spectre - here was dancing fine-boned, fine-textured  - and Claire Bayliss
was very apt as the sylphide of the little waltz, the dance sitting sweetly
on the music. As the Tsarevich in Firebird I admired both Jose Cruz-Martinez
and Nicholas Musin (who was also seen as Nijinsky's Faun).
Yet throughout the programme, a vital element seemed lacking: some link with
an interpretative past, which is the life-blood of the old repertory.
Ballets survive not just by the careful transmission of steps, but through
an imaginative contact with their performance history. Coaching in roles,
that handing on of a playing tradition, is essential if today's casts are to
succeed in these masterpieces. The Monte Carlo dancers, able, gifted, looked
somehow uncertain dealing with the nuances of style that will keep such
museum pieces alive in the theatre. That they can do so is not in doubt:
Monte Carlo's ballet owes this debt to the history of its theatre and of
dancing in this marvellous setting.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Putting a lid on Chile's
chimneys - The slow process of cleaning up the world's biggest copper mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seen from the air, the Atacama desert is like an ancient parchment, creased
by mining trails and sun-bleached into faded hues of browns and greys. Miles
before reaching Chuquicamata's huge crater, you can spot the world's biggest
copper mine by tracing the pall of sulphurous smog across the cloudless sky.
Chuquicamata's 14 furnaces smelt between 4,500 and 5,000 tonnes of copper
concentrates around the clock. Their chimneys belch more than 750 tonnes of
sulphur a day, as well as an undisclosed amount of arsenic and particulate
matter.
When the desert winds blow away from this vast complex, Chuquicamata's
10,000 workers and their families breathe more easily. When the winds turn,
it can be suffocating. Eyes sting, bronchitis cases soar and children must
be kept indoors.
It used to be worse. Ruben Pedreros, Chuquicamata's environmental officer,
says investment in two new furnaces has reduced sulphur dioxide emissions to
half the levels of the mid-1980s.
Five electrostatic precipitators, each the size of a four-storey building,
have also decreased the arsenic and dust escaping into the air. However, he
admits emissions are still way above internationally accepted health
standards.
Chuquicamata is about to embark on a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) clean-up
programme, the costliest ever in Chile, to comply with new environmental
regulations. The new law, which came into effect on January 1, imposes
stringent controls on sulphur dioxide and dust emissions, but it also gives
the worst offenders a 'reasonable' timescale to clean up their act.
In Chuquicamata's case, this is expected to take until at least 1998. The
time lag is dictated not by the scale of Chuquicamata's problems, but by the
fact that it is owned by the state copper corporation, Codelco, whose budget
is set by the Finance Ministry.
Codelco has been ordered to stagger its environmental programme because the
government is concerned about checking the levels of expenditure in the
economy. As the biggest company and exporter in Chile, Codelco has an
enormous impact on the country's overall economic activity: it produces 13
per cent of the world's copper, generates about one-fifth of the
government's yearly income, and close to one-third of Chile's total exports.
'If we had the resources, we could solve Chuquicamata's pollution problems
in two years,' says Pedreros.
Instead, Chuquicamata's decontamination plan will be stretched out until the
end of the decade, with a two-year hold-up after 1994 to allow Codelco to
tackle Caletones, the copper smelter and refinery it owns south of Santiago.
Jorge Bande, Codelco's research and development vice-president, says the
corporation will be spending between 15 and 20 per cent of its investment
budget - about Dollars 90m a year - on environmental control.
The greatest expense at Chuquicamata will involve replacing the old furnaces
with new blast ovens, which are more efficient at trapping gases. More vats
will have to be built to store sulphuric acid - a by-product of treating the
sulphur dioxide emissions - which is now being used to leach copper from
Chuquicamata's discarded waste material. The new furnaces will be attached
to electrostatic precipitators which collect the arsenic and dust particles
released by the smelting process.
The delays at implementing this programme, however, are potentially
embarrassing for the government as it tries to act as regulator of the
mining industry while owning the worst polluters. In addition to Codelco's
three copper refineries, two other mining smelters are run by the
state-owned Enami. In environmental terms, they are all in poor shape.

FT  06 JAN 93 / People: Howland-Jackson quits Nomura
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Howland-Jackson is quitting as president of Nomura International, the
UK subsidiary of Japan's biggest securities firm, to become a senior
managing director of NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking
arm of National Westminster Bank.
He will have responsibility for all NatWest's investment banking activities,
which till recently were known as County NatWest. These operations employ
2,400 people.
Martin Owen, NatWest Markets' chief executive, says he has been searching
for someone to fill the role since he took over at NatWest Markets and began
to reorganise the business six months ago.
Howland-Jackson, 43, has considerable experience of the Japanese securities
markets, having spent four years in Tokyo in the mid-1970s as Kleinwort
Benson's chief representative there. He has also worked for Morgan Guaranty
and Chemical Bank. Paradoxically, NatWest gave up its seat on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange just before Christmas. However, Owen points out that NatWest
markets will continue to employ 350 staff in Japan, in areas such as fund
management.
The recent reorganisation of NatWest Markets has involved the renaming of
its stockbroking business from County NatWest to NatWest Securities.
However, the 'County' name has been retained for the corporate advisory
department.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Business and the Environment: Leaks beneath the earth - Paul
Cheeseright examines a pioneering method of treating landfill gas seepage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unwittingly and certainly unwillingly, Ebourne Close, Kenilworth, may be on
the verge of making chemical history. This 1980s UK housing development in
Warwickshire sits on a claypit which became a landfill site. Its property
values are blighted because the landfill is still releasing methane gas.
An experiment is starting to see whether it is possible to treat the methane
gas at Ebourne Close, not by the orthodox means of extracting it, of
allowing it to ventilate, but by treating it with a chemical based on
sulphonic acid. The chemical, it is hoped, will kill the methane-producing
bacteria.
Sulphonic acid is already used in cattlefeed. 'It inhibits production of
methane from organic acids in the intestines of livestock,' explained Robert
Eden, managing director of UKPS, a landfill technology company in Warwick
University's science park.
With specialists from Imperial College, London and Warwick University, UKPS
is forming a project team to treat 'the root cause of landfill gas
migration, instead of just tackling the symptoms with extraction equipment'.
The technique is designed, Eden said, 'to neutralise the methane in situ'.
In the old and very damp claypit under Ebourne Close, the material is
largely inert debris but with organic matter resistant to decomposition or
bacterial degradation. So the idea is to push a well to the pit's lowest
point.
Water will be drawn up through the well, run through a treatment process
involving the addition of chemicals based on sulphonic acid and pushed back
into the pit from the perimeter. The circulation of the treated water
through the pit will attack the methogenic bacteria producing the methane.
Success would have widespread implications for two reasons.
First, the problem of landfill gas is both nationwide and longstanding. In
1991, the Inspectorate of Pollution identified 1,006 gassing sites in
England and Wales where, because there is residential or commercial property
nearby, controls might be needed.
In a paper on waste management, the Department of Environment said 'there is
no typical figure for the length of time that landfill gas will be evolved,
but at many sites significant gas generation can be expected to continue for
a period which is likely to be at least 15 years after the last deposit of
waste'.
What has changed in recent years has been public perception of the problem.
Alarm bells rang when, in March 1986, a bungalow exploded and households
were temporarily evacuated at the Derbyshire village of Loscoe.
Acknowledging 'growing public concern', the department said one major area
'is the evolution of landfill gas which, when inadequately controlled, has
led to explosions, fires, dangerous gas concentrations in and around houses,
odour nuisance and vegetation dieback'.
The second big implication is both commercial and legal. Land purchases
within 500 metres of a landfill site are approached with caution because of
the possibilities of gas migration. Teresa Hitchcock of Dibb Lupton
Broomhead, solicitors, observed that 'initially clients get concerned when
they hear land has been a waste tip or landfill site; they become more so if
the tip has not been regulated'.
The position is further complicated by the question of liability for any
manifestations of gas: who is responsible for difficulties stemming from
waste management decisions taken perhaps 20 years ago? Ebourne Close shows
how complex the question can become.
Roger Braithwaite of Warwick District Council's environmental health
department noted in a recent paper that the earliest documented evidence of
tipping in the Ebourne Close area was a 1949 planning approval for clay
extraction on condition the contractor undertook continual backfilling. The
site went through several ownerships. It was used for tipping both by
Kenilworth Urban District Council in the 1960s and by Warwick District
Council in the late 1970s. Planning permission for the present estate was
granted in 1980.
Routine investigations of the site by Warwick council led to the discovery
of gas concentrations and, in August 1990, to the evacuation of 42 Ebourne
Close, one of the worst affected houses.
The council has a statutory duty to inspect its area for nuisances such as
landfill gas. But this raises three snags.
The first relates to action. 'Where a statutory nuisance exists, the local
authority is obliged to take action against the person responsible. In this
case, no action has been taken to date to abate the nuisance as no practical
method of abating the nuisance is known,' Braithwaite wrote.
The second snag is deciding who is responsible for the gas at Ebourne Close,
given the site's chequered history. The third is deciding who should pay to
rectify the problem.
Provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, coming into force next
April, should cut through some of these complexities by pinning financial
responsibility for former waste tips on their owners. As the latest guidance
from the department of environment makes clear, local authorities 'must be
satisfied that the condition of the land is unlikely to cause pollution of
the environment or harm to human health' before they accept the surrender of
a licence granted to deposit waste.
The new regulations, then, are a stimulus to the search both for a means
which will prevent landfill sites from leaking gas in an uncontrolled way,
as is the case at Ebourne Close, and for a technique which will eliminate
years of controlled ventilation as at Loscoe.

FT  06 JAN 93 / People: Knox joins Bank of Scotland board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Scotland, which says its policy is to make 'interesting but
competent appointments regardless of sex and age', has chosen Lesley Knox as
a non-executive director, the first woman to join the board of Scotland's
second biggest bank.
At 39, Knox is going on for 20 years younger than most of the other
directors, who include Sir Bob Reid, Sir Alick Rankin and John Menzies. She
is the second non-executive appointee since Bruce Pattullo took over the
governorship in mid-1991. In that year three non-executive directors
retired; Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, joined with effect from
last August. Its bigger rival, the Royal Bank of Scotland, has had a woman -
Elizabeth Nelson - on the board for the past five years.
Now running the institutional investment management side of Kleinwort
Benson, Knox became a director in 1986 - making her the first female
director at any merchant bank in the City.
Her connections with the Bank of Scotland are on one level sentimental in
that it was the first company in which she owned any shares. Aged 18, she
turned up to her first agm: 'I thought I would go along to see what
happened,' says Knox, who was brought up in Edinburgh.
Since then, when working in the corporate finance division of KB, she was on
the team that advised the Edinburgh-based bank when it was considering the
purchase of a US regional bank four years ago. Company secretary Hugh Young
recalls how impressed the board had been with a presentation she made to
them at the time. 'With (the) Cadbury (recommendations on corporate
governance), the age of directors is going to drop. Under our regulations,
they can carry on to 70, but I don't think they will in future,' he adds.
Subsequently, through her corporate advisory work, Knox has met a number of
the other directors, including Thomas Hutchison, deputy governor of the bank
and a non-executive at Cadbury Schweppes. 'I hope they know I'll be making a
vociferous contribution,' she says.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Management: Women take stock of Wall Street - Female
executives have made great strides within the New York financial community
but they are still not reaching the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Muriel Siebert became the first woman member of the New York Stock
Exchange 25 years ago, a NYSE governor greeted her with the question: 'How
many more are there behind you?'
At the time it was an understandable, if somewhat hostile, query. In 1967
women were rare on Wall Street and most men wanted it kept that way.
Two-and-a-half decades later, there are far more women working on Wall
Street but they remain very much a minority, especially at the top executive
levels.
In this respect, women in the securities and investment banking business
face the same hurdles that women encounter in all the professions: they can
easily enter the workforce, but it remains a struggle to earn promotion to
upper-management levels. A 'glass ceiling' appears to exist that keeps women
from progressing further up the career ladder.
On Wall Street, the glass ceiling is particularly pronounced. While many
women occupy lower and mid-level executive positions in sales, research,
marketing and back office operations - and, to a lesser extent, in trading
and investment banking - their numbers dwindle dramatically higher up the
management hierarchy
Salomon Brothers, for example, has 159 managing directors, of which only
five are women. Of the nearly 400 senior officers listed at the back of
Morgan Stanley's 1991 annual report, about 8 per cent are women. At Kidder
Peabody, five of its 115 managing directors are women, at Merrill Lynch the
ratio is 29 out of 306, and Goldman Sachs has six women among its 165
partners.
At the very top of Wall Street - the chief executive level - women are
notable only by their complete absence. Except, of course, at the discount
broking house Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. Siebert remembers the hurdles she faced
in her earliest days when, as an industry analyst, she could not attend
crucial company briefings because they were held in men-only private clubs.
She also remembers looking for a job in 1958 and not receiving any offers
when she sent out her resume under the name of Muriel Siebert. But she
received plenty when the New York Securities Analysts Association sent out
the same resume under the name of M. Siebert.
While she says attitudes have changed considerably for the better during her
career, Siebert maintains: 'You have to dig in. l'm still a token in a
number of places and I know it.'
Ultimately, Siebert, an active member of professional women's groups,
believes real equality will be achieved when women who gain power use it on
behalf of other women.
Mina Baker Knoll, a tax partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche in Manhattan and
president of the Financial Women's Association of New York, takes a
different tack from Siebert.
Knoll believes the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that women get an
equal crack at promotion lies with managements and would like to see
companies expending as much energy on 'development and retention' of women
executives as they do on encouraging women at the entry level.
She says that nobody can make it to the top on their own. 'You need a
mentor, you need role models, and companies need to focus on developing
women in senior positions over the long term.'
Her point is echoed by Joan Zimmerman of New York recruiting firm GZ
Stephens: 'There is no doubt that many firms, especially the bulge bracket
firms (large integrated investment banking and broking houses) are
concentrating hard on bringing in minorities and women at the entry level.
What they need to deal with, however, is the promotability of these people.'
The traditional arguments against promoting women were that they were too
easily distracted by family commitments, or were ill-suited to the
aggressive, deal-making world of high finance.
Although such arguments are rarely heard today - at least not publicly  -
some women who have prospered on Wall Street accept that it is especially
difficult for a woman to run a firm. The head of fixed-income research at a
big securities house says: 'The sacrifices involved in running a firm are so
enormous. Women are certainly capable enough to do it - but are they willing
to put their life on hold? I don't think they are.'
Women have been entering Wall Street in large numbers only in the last 10-20
years. Given that senior executives at most firms are in their late 40s and
50s, there are still not enough women nearing the managerial summit to be
promoted to the top.
Many women, however, see this as just an excuse. To them, the explanation
for their lack of progress is that the Wall Street executives who make the
decisions about promotion are men. Having spent their entire career in a
business created by, shaped by, and dominated by men, these executives are
simply not comfortable with the idea of working alongside, or for, women.
There are signs, however, that this attitude is changing. A growing number
of Wall Street firms run programmes aimed especially at helping women (and
minorities) to advance within their organisations. Knoll says: 'Companies
are talking a lot more about women's issues and lifestyle issues, and are
looking for ways to respond.'
Firms, however, are generally shy about publicising the existence of
policies aimed at helping women, fearful perhaps that the publicity will
draw attention to the lack of equality at senior management levels. Merrill
Lynch is one of the few that admits it sets targets for its managers to
reach in terms of how many women and minorities work in their departments.
There is no doubt that in some areas, such as the research departments of
broking houses, women have a better chance of advancement. A few, such as
Elaine Garzarelli of Shearson Lehman and Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs,
have gone on to become high-profile market strategists.
Women have advanced further in public finance, where the clients - states,
municipalities, public pension funds - have increasingly demanded greater
representation of women and minorities from their investment banking
advisers. 'When you represent state and local governments you're subject to
more quotas and requirements,' says one municipal bond market veteran.
Trading, however, remains a difficult nut to crack, (too 'rough and tumble'
says one woman analyst, sarcastically), as does corporate finance,
especially mergers and acquisitions.
'It is true that some senior managers think women are poor negotiators,'
admits an experienced female investment banker.
But some insiders still cannot recognise that women remain under-represented
among Wall Street's elite. When the investment bank First Boston appointed a
large number of new managing directors recently, a respected Wall Street
weekly magazine noted that there were 'many women' among the promotions. How
many exactly? Of the 41 new appointments, six are women.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Management: Resolute approach to good health - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of us soon find that the new year's resolutions we made with much
enthusiasm only a few days ago quickly fall victim to the demands of
business life. But it need not be that way if you derive real pleasure from
the resolutions you make. My suggestion is to replace the stoic flavour of
traditional resolutions with new priorities on improving your quality of
life. The following should all be considered:
Rekindle close relationships. A stress-filled business life can damage
personal relationships. But remember that they are the key to your health
and happiness.
Respect your body and mind and listen to the signals they send you. Sleep
when you are tired and eat when you are hungry instead of out of habit.
Stay active. You may not like swimming and jogging. That's OK. There are
alternative exercises ranging from chopping wood to going for long walks.
Remember, diseases of all kinds tend to hate moving targets.
Make alcohol part of a larger ritual; convivial dinners are a healthy use of
alcohol. Drinking alone is a problematic form of self-medication.
Manage stress. Reading, yoga, music, sex, walking and meditation are
constructive ways to relax.
Quit smoking. There is no easy way out of this one. But if you do smoke,
limit yourself to those cigarettes you really 'enjoy'. And smokers should
avoid alcohol - it lowers their resistance.
Develop hobbies that are totally absorbing, different from your job, fun and
satisfying. If they involve your family, so much the better.
There is mounting scientific evidence that the age-old axiom 'laughter is
the best medicine' contains more than a kernel of truth. Humour is the
easiest way to reduce stress.
Make enjoyment of life a priority. Keep in mind that life is your real
career, not business or a profession.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MURIEL SIEBERT's appointment as the first woman member of the New York Stock
Exchange on December 28, 1967, was unusual enough to warrant a front page
photograph and article in the New York Times.
Since then, Siebert has become a familiar face, not just because she is a
high-profile woman in a masculine world, but also because of her
achievements in government - she was New York's superintendent of banks
between 1977 and 1982 - and her work for charities.
Siebert has been a pioneer in more ways than one. On 'May Day' in 1975 -
when fixed commissions for stockbrokers were abolished in the US - her firm
became one of the country's first 'discount brokers' to cut transaction fees
charged to investors, a move that earned her many enemies on Wall Street.
After more than two decades at the top, Siebert remains committed to her
various causes - especially supporting women in business.
She says: 'The men at the top of industry and government should be more
willing to risk sharing leadership with women and minority members who are
not merely clones of their white male buddies.
'In these fast-changing times we need different viewpoints and experiences,
we need an enlarged talent bank. The real risk lies in continuing to do
things the way they've always been done.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / Getting satisfaction from staff surveys: Nigel Nicholson
argues it is in management's own interest to discover what employees really
think
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employee attitude surveys are becoming popular in British companies. For
many, they are a new addition to a portfolio of human resources management
techniques. So they are big business for consultancies. But what benefits do
surveys yield, and are they worth it?
Management traditionalists express some trenchant objections to them which
should not be dismissed lightly as primitivism, but provide pause for
thought. The objections include that:
Good managers already know their staff's opinions. But how do managers know
if their reading of opinions is correct? In almost every company survey we
have conducted, critical gaps have been revealed between what top management
believe staff will say and what staff actually do say. Once managers have
overcome their wounded pride at some of the responses, there is much to be
learned. The news is never all bad, and there are always things to
celebrate. Indeed, in many areas there may be considerable value in
confirming what you suspected but could not prove - for example, that staff
feel pride in the company, or positive about their immediate bosses.
Most valuable, though, will be the early warning of potential trouble spots
that sophisticated analysis can reveal. Last, but not least, the comments
and reactions of even lowly employees will contain a wealth of perceptive
and intelligent suggestions for the future.
Surveys are a superficial, impersonal and bureaucratic method. Yes, they are
superficial inasmuch as they must ask simple and direct questions, which is
more an argument for treating surveys as a step toward deeper inquiry than
as ends in themselves. Yes, they are impersonal, to the degree that they
rely on standardised questions. They are no substitute for good personal
communications.
Are surveys bureaucratic? Undoubtedly they sit better with paper-driven than
paper- phobic cultures, but management should test the climate by talking to
staff doing an early pilot draft. In widely differing kinds of organisation
there is an overwhelmingly favourable reaction to the survey initiative.
'Thanks for asking us' is a common response.
Surveys give a free-ride to grumblers. Yes they do, but this begs the
question of why people want to grumble in the first place. Moreover, there
are two ways to protect against the capricious or habitual grumbler. First,
benchmarking. For any question it is important to know what is the normal
range of response. If you ask people if they are satisfied with their
working conditions, you need to know what minimum margin of discontent can
reasonably be expected.
The second protection is careful question design, avoiding leading or
blank-cheque negative ones. This looks easier than it actually is, and
artfully designed surveys balance opportunities for open criticism with
opportunities for appreciation.
Surveys open cans of worms and raise false hopes. The first rule of
surveying is that if you do not want to hear the answer, then do not ask the
question. Management must be prepared for any possible reaction to a
question, not just what it assumes is likely, or what it would like to hear.
And it must start thinking, even before the question is asked, what would be
its response to negative opinions. In the worst managed companies leaders
are likely to explain away or deny bad news. The survey consultant bears a
major responsibility here in preparing the ground.
Survey design is also critical to the issue of raising of false
expectations. Do not ask questions in ways which make it look as if you are
holding a referendum. Surveys are not management by plebiscite.
Management's commitment, clearly communicated at the outset, should be not
only to take action where feasible and desirable, but also to be frank about
reasons for not acting where to do so would be unreasonably difficult,
contentious or costly. Fast, honest and clear feedback of results and likely
outcomes is essential to the reaping of goodwill from a survey.
Surveys contain built-in bias because of the unknown opinions of the many
who do not respond. This is usually an exaggerated fear. Research following
up non- respondents shows that bias is modest when return rates of over 50%
are achieved - it is the apathetics rather than the enthusiasts or
dissidents who fail to respond. But there are many other more mundane
reasons for non-response, such as pressure of work, absenteeism, mislaid
survey forms, and distribution failures. However, in a well-designed and
carefully introduced survey, levels of 65 per cent plus can be expected.
There are also technical ways of checking statistically for bias, and
rebalancing data accordingly.
So if surveying is not to be taken lightly, what is involved in taking it
seriously, and what genuine benefits can be reaped?
First, it is best not seen as a one-off exercise, but as a long term
continuing commitment to listening to employees. Companies with long
traditions of surveying, such as IBM and the Prudential, cultivate
'survey-friendly' environments in which employees expect to be regularly
consulted, achieving a norm of high participation rates as a result. One
survey is a snapshot, a series gives a moving picture. The benefit here is
that the company begins to assemble a human resource database to rival those
of the 'hard' functional disciplines of finance and marketing. This has the
potential to be used to set targets for measurable and rewardable
improvements in management practice.
Second, a survey is not just a medical check-up on the corporate body but an
exercise in best practice communications. The effective survey is the
organisation talking to itself. This is a source of strength on the
principle that the intelligent systems which have self-knowledge are better
able to survive in a changing world. Surveys also send a 'cultural signal'
about openness, listening and responsiveness. For this to be credible, the
organisation needs to examine critically its current culture, and to ensure
that the culture signal is consistent with the predominant values of the
organisation. If not, then it must signal a genuine commitment to moving
toward the values of a high-trust and high-involvement culture.
Surveys can give a powerful impetus to culture change programmes, as our
work with BP's Project 90 and with other companies has shown. But culture
change back-tracking, or not seeing itthrough, will do more harm than good.
This is not a failing of the survey, but of management action.
Given the risks, are surveys worth the cost? A comprehensive survey
programme, involving piloting, design, analysis, normative benchmarking and
feedback reports can be a sizable investment, but no more than that for many
management training programmes and other forms of corporate communication.
What do you get for this? Surveys can range over a very wide terrain,
including people's careers, their bosses' style, and their company's public
image. Surveys also provide potentially valuable data about the experience
and qualities of staff across levels and functions, including areas where
the company is most vulnerable to losing key staff.
Amateurish surveys are damaging. But well-conducted ones which feed into
management training, staff development, and strategic planning really can
give organisations a leading-edge advantage.

FT  06 JAN 93 / How managers' styles differ: British Psychological Society
Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH executives manage from experience, their peers in Korea use manuals,
while Iranians are guided by national beliefs, according to a survey of
almost 2,000 decision makers in 16 countries.
Only the Finns and the Dutch are more individualistic and independent in
decision-making than UK managers, delegates were told yesterday at the
British Psychological Society's occupational psychology conference in
Brighton.
The survey, which was completed by at least 100 managers in each country,
also found that Portuguese managers were likely to rely on guidance from
superiors and that managers in Nigeria tended to make their decisions by the
book, using company manuals or rule books. The research, funded by the
Japanese photocopier and camera producer, Canon, found that Japanese
managers relied partly on their own experience and training and partly on
their superiors, as did the Americans, Australians and South Africans.
Dr Peter Smith, reader in social psychology at Sussex University's School of
Social Sciences, said: 'Multinational companies need to be very aware of the
different preferences as to how decisions might be taken in different parts
of the world.'
He said: 'Outside of western countries, we found much more reliance on
superiors, much more reliance on manuals on rules of procedure and in some
countries, particularly Muslim countries, people said they rely on beliefs
which are widespread nationally.'
The survey suggests managers in all countries believe decisions based on
their own experience and training usually give the best results.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Value of stress courses is queried: British Psychological
Society Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRESS management courses may be 'money for old rope', two senior
psychologists told the conference yesterday.
That is because stress is a confused concept that reveals little about
employees' difficulties at work, according to Ms Shirley Reynolds, clinical
psychologist with the Medical Research Council at Sheffield University, and
Dr Rob Briner, occupational psychology lecturer at London University's
Birkbeck College.
Dr Briner said: 'If we do believe these courses are money for old rope, then
in the world of business psychology that is not unusual.'
Ms Reynolds said: 'I certainly would not spend money on them, but on the
other hand many organisations spend money on graphologists (handwriting
analysts) in recruitment - I wouldn't do that, either.'
They told delegates: 'The academic and practitioner communities of
occupational psychologists have collectively ignored, avoided or denied the
theoretical and conceptual confusion and the empirical inconsistencies in
the occupational stress literature.'
Such selective reading of the literature led psychologists to make
'over-optimistic' claims about the effectiveness of many stress management
strategies.
Ms Reynolds said: 'If there is no clear link between stress and poor
performance at work, then interventions which are based on that assumption
are unlikely to be particularly helpful.'
She said: 'Most stress management courses are based on a 'feel good' factor.
Some people certainly do experience distress at work but just sending along
10 or 12 people who have nothing wrong with them is unlikely to deliver
anything more than very short-term benefits because there is nothing to
cure.'
Job satisfaction declines significantly in the aftermath of privatisation,
but recovers after subsequent restructuring, a study suggests.
'Privatised companies should restructure as soon as possible instead of
waiting a few months, as is more usual,' Professor Cary Cooper of Manchester
School of Management told the conference.
His study of 620 employees of a privatised water company found that job
satisfaction declined after privatisation.

FT  06 JAN 93 / BR privatisation may start with seven franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN FIVE and seven franchises to operate British Rail passenger services
will be transferred to the private sector in the first year of the
privatisation of Britain's railways, the government indicated yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told BBC Radio that the government
would 'build up' from that level - 30 or 40 franchises might eventually be
made available.
As the row over the proposed privatisation rumbled on, senior Tories joined
Labour in criticising the government's plans as dated or potentially
unworkable.
Lord Ridley, a former Conservative transport secretary, underlined his
reservations, predicting that few would be prepared to 'embark on
franchising' because 'they do not know what benefits they will get from
running the trains'.
Emphasising the link between railway infrastructure and the rolling stock
that uses it, Lord Ridley said separating the two was 'a very difficult
thing to do'. In such circumstances, he said, pricing would require very
difficult calculations, 'particularly if one is publicly owned and the other
privately owned'. Mr George Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham, said that while
the government's plans might work for certain lines, if others continued to
be subsidised, 'one asks oneself what is the point of the exercise'.
He added: 'I profoundly hope the point of the exercise is not just to go
ahead willy-nilly with some kind of dated political commitment.'
For Labour, Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, called on Mr
MacGregor to resign. 'Franchising has already taken place and failed - we
already know the experiment does not work,' he said.
Meanwhile, the all-party Commons transport committee yesterday released a
timetable of meetings scheduled for later this month in connection with its
scrutiny of the government's privatisation plans.
Witnesses will include Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman, Sir Peter
Parker, one of his predecessors, and Lord Prior, the former Tory cabinet
minister.
Officials said the committee hoped to arrange a meeting with Mr MacGregor
during its inquiries. It hopes to produce a report in February or March.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Football pools adapt to meet lottery challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTBALL POOLS operators are adapting their game for the first time for more
than 20 years to try to be more competitive with the planned National
Lottery, with its top prize of Pounds 1m a week.
The three main pools operators - Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters - said
yesterday they were changing their scoring system to increase the chances of
more big jack-pots.
The new points system will separate matches that are drawn 1-1 from other
score draws. From February 27, each 1-1 draw will get 3 points, other score
draws only 2 1/2 points and no-score draws only 2 points.
Both home and away wins will receive 1 1/2 points and the old 1-point level
will disappear. Eight of the new 1-1 draws would produce the winning 24
points.
'The changes we have announced today demonstrate the determination of the
pools industry to provide a strong competitive response to the challenge
posed by the imminent introduction of the National Lottery,' said Mr Malcolm
Hughes, managing director of Vernons Pools.
Statistical analysis of results suggests that the new scor-ing system will
restore frequent big wins and pro-duce at least one jackpot a month.
The change does not mean that the pools will be paying out more money
overall, unless the large jackpots attract more players.
In recent years there has been an increase in the number of score draws
leading to fewer jackpots and a larger number of smaller dividends. An
additional dividend level is also being introduced as part of yesterday's
changes, to provide a wide range of smaller prizes.
There are about 12m regular pools players every week and the industry, with
6,500 employees and 70,000 local collectors, had turnover of Pounds 800m in
1991.
The pools operators are continuing to lobby for 'a level playing field' in
the battle with the National Lottery.
Operators claim that unless that happens, two of the big three would go out
of business with the loss of thousands of jobs.
The pools industry wants to be able to collect coupons from retail outlets,
advertise on radio and television, have comparable treatment in the way
turnover is treated for tax and donations and roll up prize funds from one
week to the next.
At the moment, pools prize funds have to be made up from the income received
during the same week.
The National Lottery Bill is due to have its second reading in the House of
Commons later this month.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Revenue rule move forces Pep changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the fund management group, is being forced by a change in an
Inland Revenue rule to write to between 800 and 1,000 unit holders, telling
them they must restructure their personal equity plans by April 6 or face
full taxation thereafter.
The move, throwing into question up to Pounds 2m of investors' money, stems
from a rule- drafting error made by the Revenue in July and its subsequent,
unprecedented, decision to rewrite the Pep rules retrospectively.
The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any funds held in bond or
gilt-based sums ineligible for Pep investment. Currently Pep holders can
invest up to Pounds 1,500 in such so-called 'non-qualifying' funds.
Most of the investors affected hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep portfolio,
launched in September last year, which exploited the loophole.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Patten predicts rise in school opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday predicted an acceleration in
the number of schools opting out of local authority control. But he set only
a modest target for the number likely to opt out this year.
Seeking to counter claims that the government's campaign to sever the link
between state schools and local authorities is failing, Mr Patten said the
popularity of grant-maintained schools was undeniable. He said: 'I believe
that 1993 will see the one thousandth school endorse a ballot to become
grant-maintained.'
The target of 1,000 is much lower than projections made by ministers a year
ago. At present, only 334 of the 21,000 state schools in England are
grant-maintained.
Most of the schools that have opted out are in Tory-controlled authorities.
A study this week by Labour local authorities claims that as the number of
ballots on opting out has increased in recent months, so has the number
going against. In October, parents at 75 schools voted to opt out, while in
20 they voted against. In December the numbers were 57 for opting out and 21
against.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said opting out was causing
chaos in the education system and that 1993 would see 'the fightback'
against 'increasing centralisation'.
Nevertheless, Mr Patten's bill to provide for a new funding council for
grant-maintained schools will soon complete its passage through the Commons,
and looks poised to become law before the summer.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Receiverships down by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership or administration fell by
more than 10 per cent last year, figures released yesterday disclosed.
Receivership appointments and administration orders under UK insolvency law
fell to 5,151 in 1992 from 5,734 in the previous year.
The figures, which have shown a downward monthly trend for most of the year,
were analysed by accountants Touche Ross from the official London and
Edinburgh Gazettes. Only in January, November and December last year were
the figures higher than in the same month during 1991.
The figures provide a different picture from those recently released by Dun
&amp; Bradstreet, but are compiled on a different basis and do not include
personal bankruptcies and corporate liquidations.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said he believed receivership and administration appointments provided a
more accurate representation of the status of businesses by excluding the
one-person companies. Mr Morris said he believed the decline reflected the
fact that remaining companies were a 'strong core', likely to weather the
recession.
He warned that appointments were likely to increase again with economic
recovery, as the value of assets grew and banks called in receivers to
recover their loans.
The greatest number of appointments were in London and the south-east, at
2,177, followed by the north-west with 641 and the west Midlands with 463.
Manufacturing appointments accounted for 27 per cent of the total during the
year, while the rate of failure increased among retailers and wholesalers.
Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, was the most commonly
appointed firm, with 902 jobs during the year. KPMG Peat Marwick was second
at 623 and Touche Ross third at 559.
National Westminster bank was the debenture-holder that most commonly called
in receivers, making 1,104 appointments during the year, reflecting its
substantial small business portfolio.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Rise in M0 fuels hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the M0 measure of money supply in December has increased
expectations that the UK economy may be starting to recover.
M0, which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, rose by a
seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between November and December, the Bank of
England said yesterday.
In the year to December, M0 growth was 3 per cent, the same as the
year-on-year rise in November. That figure came after several months in
which M0 growth had been depressed, reflecting low economic activity.
The Treasury said Britain's underlying foreign-currency reserves fell by
Dollars 2.95bn in December compared with the previous month.
The overall level of the UK's reserves fell by Dollars 433m in December,
bringing the total at the end of the month to Dollars 41.65bn.
Most of the change in the underlying position is believed to represent
D-Marks repaid last month by the the Bank of England to the Bundesbank, for
currency borrowed in September in efforts to defend sterling on 'Black
Wednesday'.
Adding to impressions that the economic outlook may be brightening was the
finding by Gallup, the market research organisation, that consumer
confidence, although still depressed, rose in December compared with
November.
Gallup said a balance of 19 per cent of consumers last month thought the
economy would worsen, as opposed to a balance of 29 per cent who felt the
same the previous month. This was the most optimistic reading since August
last year.
M0 is considered by the Treasury to provide a good indication of demand and
inflation pressures in the economy at the consumer level. The Treasury said
the latest figures were encouraging.
The December figure fits in with indications from retailers that shop
spending picked up last month.

MOVES were announced yesterday to fill the gap created by the closure on
Monday of the Dover-Boulogne ferry service operated by P&amp;O European Ferries.
The French company Opale Ferries, which operates a freight-only service
between Boulogne and Folkestone, indicated that it was likely to add a
second ship to the route in the near future because it was close to capacity
even before P&amp;O's withdrawal.

LABOUR warned yesterday that an apparent 15 per cent fall in house
repossessions provoked by mortgage arrears was disguising a real increase in
the number of families under threat.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said independent analysis
suggested there had been a 6 per cent rise in the number of homes under
suspended repossession orders.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, said actual repossessions were down
and the pressure of mortgage repayments on individuals was being
systematically eased by the fall in interest rates.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 5M programme to prevent low-flying aircraft sucking the tiles off
roofs was announced yesterday by Heathrow Airport.
Hundreds of houses in the Heathrow area will be protected after the first
comprehensive study of the vortex phenomenon. Vortices are circulating
currents of air generated by aircraft.
The study found that fewer than 0.1 per cent of aircraft movements (about
400 a year) cause damage and that is usually limited to about six tiles.
Now houses, mainly in the Cranford, Hatton and East Bedfont areas, as well
as churches, hospitals and schools near Heathrow, will have metal clips
fitted to hold down the tiles.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Aldwych Tube station to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST train to Aldwych Tube station in central London will run on April 2
after a decision by London Underground to close the station on economic
grounds, Richard Evans writes.
The station, on a spur of the Piccadilly Line from Holborn, is open only at
peak times and carries 450 passengers a day to offices in the Strand, Covent
Garden and Fleet Street areas.
Costs of upgrading the 86-year-old station - in phases to 2021 - would be
Pounds 10.7m, including Pounds 3m for lifts that need replacing immediately.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, said
yesterday: 'At a time when the government has just reduced the amount it
promised for capital investment on the existing network, the cost of
replacing the lifts cannot be justi-fied.'
Annual station costs at Aldwych, including maintenance, energy and staff
salaries, are about Pounds 104,000 - the cost of running trains is just
under Pounds 100,000. Total revenue generated by the station in the current
financial year is an estimated Pounds 53,000.
Closure notices will be published this week before objections are invited in
February.
They will be considered by the London Regional Passengers Committee and Mr
John MacGregor, transport secretary, before a final decision is reached on
the proposed closing date.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Prescott call adds to pressure on Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on Mr John Smith to put a firm stamp on the Labour leadership
mounted further yesterday as Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary,
called for the party to make a decisive shift back to conviction politics.
The implicit criticism of Mr Smith's six-month tenure as opposition leader
came in a recorded BBC television programme - due to be broadcast today -
echoing widespread media criticism of Labour's post-election performance. Mr
Prescott said the British people responded positively to 'politicians with
convictions' who were committed to ideas.
'That is why Thatcher was quite popular with a lot of people,' he said.
'They knew where they stood with her. They don't know where they stand with
Labour on some essential questions - you have to spell it out.'
Mr Prescott's comments will anger many senior Labour figures who argue that,
with an election probably some four years away, Mr Smith is right to take
his time reforming the party and its policies.
Even so, the comments reflect the anxiety of Labour supporters on all sides
of the party, many of whom are demanding a swifter response to last April's
fourth successive election defeat.
Mr Prescott is viewed widely as a representative of traditional Labour
supporters who oppose efforts by so-called modernisers to revamp the party's
image. Some modernisers will nevertheless tacitly endorse his call for a
more rigorous style of leadership.
The revelation this week of further details of a confidential Labour opinion
poll under-lining the extent of public disenchantment with the party has
served only to emphasise the distance Labour must travel to win a real
chance of office.
A fresh effort to persuade a sceptical Labour leadership to adopt a policy
of electoral reform for elections to the Commons will be launched tomorrow.
But there are signs that the tide is turning against changing the
first-past-the-post system.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and a long-standing
advocate of proportional representation, will tomorrow put the case for
reform in an article in New Statesman and Society. Labour officials insisted
last night that it was still far too early to predict the final conclusions
of the Plant committee on electoral systems.
Observers increasingly believe that widely diverging views across the party
mean that in order to avert a damaging internal schism the status quo is
unlikely to be changed.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Tax rule change shakes up Pep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NUKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVE &amp; PROSPER, the fund management group, is being forced by a change in an
Inland Revenue rule to write to between 800 and 1,000 unit holders, telling
them they must restructure their personal equity plans by April 6 or face
full taxation thereafter.
The move, throwing into question up to Pounds 2m of investors' money, stems
from a rule drafting error made by the Revenue in July and its subsequent,
unprecedented, decision to rewrite the Pep rules retrospectively.
The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any funds held in bond or
gilt-based sums ineligible for Pep investment. Currently Pep holders can
invest up to Pounds 1,500 in such so-called 'non-qualifying' funds.
Most of the investors affected hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep portfolio,
launched in September last year, which exploited the loophole and combined
Pep investments in equity and bond-based unit trusts for the first time.
The decision to rewrite the rules was taken by Mr Stephen Dorrel, financial
secretary to the Treasury, who said the use of bond and gilt-based funds by
Pep's was not in the spirit of the original legislation.
Mr Ken Emery, Save &amp; Prosper's technical director, called the Revenue's
action 'vindictive' but said the company would comply. He added: 'The Inland
Revenue has admitted that the mistake was theirs but have nevertheless
introduced this change retrospectively. We have no choice but to write to
unit holders advising them of the situation and recommending that they
switch out of the Pep - we cannot move people automatically.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / Effect of sell-offs on morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB satisfaction declines significantly in the aftermath of privatisation,
but recovers after subsequent restructuring, a study suggests.
'Privatised companies should restructure as soon as possible instead of
waiting a few months, as is more usual,' Professor Cary Cooper of Manchester
School of Management - part of the University of Manchester's Institute of
Science and Technology - told the conference in Brighton yesterday.
His study of 620 employees of one of the 10 privatised water companies found
that job satisfaction among managers, staff and manual workers declined
after privatisation. Mental and physical health deteriorated.
A year later, after a restructuring of the company, about 490 of the
original sample reported an almost complete recovery.
Prof Cooper told the conference: 'The reorganisation was effectively
communicated to the workforce, goals became clear and the opposite then
occurred: job satisfaction increased, mental health stabilised or increased,
and physical health increased.'

say in a joint survey published today. It covers comments from 643 companies
in the last quarter of 1992.
The proportion of manufacturing companies with larger domestic order books
increased to 20 per cent in December from 13 per cent in September. The
proportion of such companies receiving more export orders rose to 23 per
cent from 19 per cent.
The position was less encouraging for service companies. The increase in
domestic orders was less marked and the proportion of companies with larger
export order books declined by December to 16 per cent from 23 per cent in
September.
By the end of last year, 48 per cent of manufacturing companies and 39 per

FT  06 JAN 93 / Radio 4 listeners to march on BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 4 listeners, angry at the prospect of losing their favourite
programmes on long wave, have again threatened to march on Broadcasting
House.
Original plans for a march were cancelled in October after BBC executives
persuaded the organiser, Mr Nick MacKinnon, a Winchester schoolmaster, that
the protesters had prevailed. The march is now planned for April.
The BBC governors postponed the planned launch of a 24-hour news service on
long wave until April 1994. The BBC also promised that the new service would
not go ahead unless 'the transmission arrangements for Radio 4 meet the
listeners' needs throughout the UK'. New booster FM transmitters are being
built.
Miss Rachel Mawhood, the new UK co-ordinator of the Radio 4 Campaign, is
sceptical about BBC promises, saying FM is difficult to receive in many
parts of the country. She listens to Radio 4 programmes on long wave to get
better reception even though she lives in the Greenwich area of London.
'They can put 24-hour news on FM or Radio 5 if they want to,' Miss Mawhood
said.
The BBC argues that Gulf war coverage demonstrated the need for a 24-hour
news service that will also carry the main Radio 4 current affairs
programmes such as Today.
On Saturday in the Call To Account programme on Radio 4, Mr Michael Green,
the channel controller, said the BBC wanted to add a service that would be
of value to listeners.
'The question is where do we put it,' Mr Green said, apparently suggesting
that the issue was not entirely cut and dried. Mr Green insisted it would
not be practical to put the news service on Radio 5.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Doctors warn on community care plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY FAMILY doctors lack confidence that adequate resources will be
available when new arrangements for community care come into force on April
1, a British Medical Association survey shows.
It says 64 per cent of general practitioners are not confident that local
community care plans will be in place by April. More than 90 per cent of GPs
said they had not been consulted on arrangements for discharging people in
need of care from hospital to the community, and the survey reflected
general concern that the reforms would be underfunded.
Local authorities will become responsible for assessing and co-ordinating
care for elderly and handicapped people. The intention is to provide care in
the community where possible, rather than in institutions.
Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA's general medical services committee, said
that unless local authorities contacted individual GP practices to arrange
plans, family doctors would end up rescuing patients not getting the
services they needed.
Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister responsible for community care, said the
government had written to all GPs about their role in the reforms. Health
authorities and local authorities should make sure GPs knew about changes in
their areas.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Hoover workers agree settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 151 workers at a Hoover washing machine plant in south Wales who were
due to take the company to an industrial tribunal next week for alleged
unfair dismissal have agreed a settlement. Under the deal they will receive
Pounds 3,300 each.
A meeting of the men and women who were made redundant in May 1991 from the
Merthyr Tydfil plant overwhelmingly agreed to accept the company's offer.
Hoover said yesterday: 'We are in discussions with the unions through Acas
(the conciliation service), but we can neither confirm nor deny that an
agreement has been reached.'
The settlement is understood to have been reached after talks in London last
month between Mr Ian Bonnar, Hoover's vice-president of manufacturing, and
national officials of the AEEU engineering and electricians union.
The workers were claiming the company should have adhered to the previous
policy of last-in, first-out. For the first time for years, Hoover had
decided to choose those to be made redundant.
If the workers' claim had failed before the tribunal they were prepared to
challenge the criteria used as the basis for dismissal in each individual
case. A challenge could have prolonged the hearing for months, costing the
company millions of pounds.
An earlier case before a tribunal concerning 36 port workers extended over
two years and cost more than Pounds 1m before an out-of-court settlement was
reached.
The Merthyr decision will cost Hoover Pounds 500,000 before any legal
charges. The company has been anxious to avoid bad publicity as it is about
to launch a new range of models.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Conventions will limit claims against insurers: Insurance
group fears heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'AT THE moment we are looking at a heavy loss, but if the vessel breaks up,
this will be a major catastrophe,' said Mr Michael Thorpe of Skuld, the
Norwegian protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) club, which provides liability
insurance for Bergvall &amp; Hudner Ship Management, manager of the stricken
Braer.
He said that under the terms of two international conventions to which the
UK is a signatory, potential insurance claims to meet the cost of the
pollution clean-up and related losses should be contained to a maximum of
Dollars 35m (Pounds 23m).
Liability for the Braer is limited to about Dollars 17m under the Civil
Liability Convention - funded by tanker owners - and to between Dollars 33m
and Dollars 35m under the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.
London marine insurers and brokers said that for the limits to be breached,
claimants would need to show that the vessel's owners were, at least, guilty
of gross negligence.
Friends of the Earth, the environment group, is urging the introduction of
unlimited liability for tanker accidents.
Of the potential Dollars 35m payout, Skuld, the fourth-biggest P&amp;I club with
premium income of more than Dollars 150m, would pay Dollars 2m. Sixteen P&amp;I
clubs, owned by shipping fleets, would meet the next Dollars 13m.
Claims above Dollars 15m would fall on the reinsurance market, largely
through a scheme negotiated by the P&amp;I clubs with Lloyd's syndicates and
London market companies. Reinsurers would cover claims up to Dollars 500m if
convention limits were breached.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Homes 'undervalued' for council tax: Institute of British
Geographers Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has systematically undervalued properties in its
classification of households for the new council tax, according to an
academic study released yesterday.
Mr Paul Longley of Bristol University and Mr Gary Higgs of Cardiff
University told the annual conference of the Institute of British
Geographers in London they had found substantial variations between the
value of houses measured by asking price and the valuation bands issued to
councils last month.
Their study, based on asking prices for 46,000 properties in inner Cardiff,
found that 27 per cent of properties had been undervalued and placed in the
band below the one their prices would suggest. Only 13 per cent of
properties had been placed in a higher band.
The council tax rates are likely to be used as a basis for estimates by
mortgage valuers and estate agents and so are likely to contribute to
further house price deflation.
The patterns also suggest that council tax valuations - which are supposed
to be based on capital values of houses - may have been based partly on
figures in the old rates registers - which were based on estimated rental
values.
The findings suggest that the tax will be a greater burden in suburbs than
in inner-city areas.
Within the inner cities, estimates suggest that small terraced houses will
pay about the same in council tax as the amount they paid under the old
rates system. Property in gentrified areas will pay less tax than rates.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Course charted followed guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS have questioned the presence of an ageing oil tanker off
the coast of one of the UK's most fragile ecosystems, but there is no
evidence to suggest that the Braer was flouting marine guidelines.
About 1,000 tankers a year chart the notoriously choppy waters of the
22-mile-wide channel separating Sumburgh Head from Fair Isle.
The Braer had loaded oil from Statoil's Gullfaks field in the Norwegian
sector of the North Sea. It had left Norway on Sunday to sail for Quebec,
carrying Dollars 11m-worth of oil for Ultramar's Canadian refinery.
The tanker's route took it into the channel amid a force 10 storm. The crew
charted a course through the middle of the channel, but engine problems
caused the tanker to drift out of control.
Mr Paul Roberts of Ocean Routes, which tracks the weather and plans routes
for tankers, said: 'They (tankers) plot their course based on a weather
forecast that extends three days ahead, but that won't show a lot on a 15 to
16-day voyage.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / Tougher regulation urged for tankers: Safety standards at
sea criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROUNDING of the tanker Braer off Shetland yesterday has led to calls
for the UK to tighten its restrictions on allowing ageing tankers into
environmentally sensitive areas.
The Merchant Navy Officers' Union said a steep decline in maritime safety
standards had resulted in a huge increase in the number of sub-standard
ships in British waters.
The Oil Pollution Act, which was passed in the US in August 1990 in the
aftermath of the Exxon Valdez tragedy, will phase out the use of older,
single-hulled tankers at US ports over the next 15 years. It also restricts
the use of single-hulled vessels in environmentally fragile areas.
The Braer was carrying 619,300 barrels of oil - more than double the 300,000
barrels spilt by the Exxon Valdez, which ran aground off the coast of Alaska
in 1989.
The Braer, which was built in 1975, had been in good condition with no
previous record of serious accidents, according to Mr Norman Hook at Lloyd's
Casualties.
But, like most of the world's ageing tanker fleet, the Braer was a
single-hulled vessel without the added protection of an outer casing, which
minimises the risk of oil spills.
Under rules introduced by the United Nations' International Maritime
Organisation in March last year, this type of tanker cannot now be built,
and all new tankers must have double hulls.
Mr Roger Kohn of the institute said: 'There is some concern that the
existing tanker fleet is getting older and there is a big gap between
pollution control standards on old and new vessels.'
The institute rules require that all existing tankers be brought up to the
same pollution control standards as newly built double-hulled vessels by
1995.
That involves extensive refits to the world's fleet of tankers, estimated to
cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 52m) a vessel.
The institute has rejected US insistence that all existing tankers be fitted
with double hulls in favour of retaining more options such as refitting
tankers with hydrostatic controls which equalise the pressure in the oil
tank and outside in order to minimise oil spills.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, asked why
the UK government had not followed the US administration in learning the
lessons from the Exxon Valdez disaster and tightened controls on oil
tankers.
'I insist they (the government) now adopt the rules the United States have
already implemented,' he said.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Wildlife at risk as oil spreads: Braer spillage 'potentially
catastrophic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE environmental impact of the wrecked Braer oil tanker near Sumburgh Head
in Shetland was described last night by the World Wide Fund for Nature as
'potentially catastrophic'.
Lord Caithness, the shipping minister, said after briefing the prime
minister: 'We have got the dispersants, the planes and the tugs. We are very
clear what we are going to do. At the moment the sea is doing the job for
us.
'Nature has taken over,' he continued. 'It is perhaps a good thing there is
a gale because that will help to diversify the oil, break it down and get
rid of it. If it calms down, we will try to spray tomorrow.' He said there
would be a wide-ranging inquiry into the disaster.
Mr Jonathan Wills, a wildlife expert living on Shetland, said such a
shipwreck had been feared for 15 years: 'This was the disaster that was not
supposed to happen.'
Ms Sian Pullen, marine conservation officer with the wildlife fund, said the
organisation was asking for special routeing for certain types of tankers
around environmentally sensitive areas. 'Questions should be asked about why
a ship carrying such a hazardous substance was navigating through this area
in dangerous conditions,' she said.
The southern tip of Shetland, which has four sites designated as having
special scientific interest, is recognised as an internationally important
area for seabirds and marine life. A chain of life from microscopic marine
organisms to birds, porpoises and whales is at risk from pollution.
Ms Nancy Harrison, marine policy officer for the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, said: 'This is a potential major disaster for wildlife.
Questions must be asked why a single-hulled tanker, which is banned around
sensitive coastlines in other countries, is allowed to be in one of
Britain's most vulnerable sites for marine wildlife.'
She said that thousands of seabirds might be lost in the oil spillage, but
that the catastrophe would have been worse had the ship been wrecked in
summer, when more birds would have been nesting on shore. 'In a sense, we're
lucky it isn't summer, but I don't want to understate the importance of the
area for birds in winter.'
The oil spill from the wreck of the Aegean Sea off the north-west coast of
Spain just before Christmas killed about 3,000 seabirds, but that area is
not noted for its bird populations. 'My feeling is if we come out that lucky
we will be very, very happy,' Ms Harrison said. 'I think it will be more
than that.'
The birds most immediately under threat in the Shetlands are sea duck and
diving species. The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust rates Shetland as probably
Britain's most important site for wintering sea ducks, with about 10,300
wintering birds - roughly 7 per cent of the UK population.
Shetland has colonies of eider, long-tailed duck and large numbers of
guillemots and shag. Other seabirds such as the fulmar, little auk and great
northern diver are also vulnerable. Dr Harrison said the threat to colonies
of black guillemot was particularly worrying because local populations would
be unlikely to recover quickly.
Some colonies have still not recovered from the last big spill in the area
in 1979, when the tanker Esso Bernicia ran into a terminal at Sullom Voe.
About 3,700 birds died and the eider duck population declined by more than a
quarter between 1979 and 1984.
Mr Ian McCall, conservation officer at the RSPB's Scottish office, said the
tanker could not have run aground at a more sensitive spot: Shetland was one
of the most important wildlife centres in the whole north-east Atlantic
region.
Wildlife conservationists were hoping last night that coast-dwelling species
in the Sumburgh area would have been on the opposite side of the headland,
sheltering from the storm. Tens of thousands of other seabirds that nest
among Shetland's cliff colonies are well out at sea, where they feed and
live after the breeding season, returning in the spring.
There are fears that if much oil leaks into the sea it might circulate
around the islands, making a rapid clean-up difficult. In such
circumstances, it would be a struggle to have the shores cleaned before the
sea-ranging birds return to nest in a few months.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE VOYAGE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Braer left Mongstad near Bergen in Norway on Sunday heading for
   Quebec in Canada.
Chartered course through the middle of the notoriously choppy
   22-mile-wide channel between Sumburgh Head and Fair Isle. It kept 10
   miles away from the coast in line with advice from maritime
   authorities.
Seas are usually calmer taking route around Herma Ness, but that adds
   60 miles to journey.
In the early hours of yesterday morning, in a force 10 storm, engine
   problems caused the tanker to begin drifting. It ran aground at
   Garths Ness near Sumburgh Head.

WRECKS THAT MADE THE HEADLINES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between January and June 1942 German U-Boats torpedoed a number of
tankers off the east coast of the US with a loss of some 600,000 tonnes
of oil. The grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound,
Alaska, on 24 March 1989 ranks outside the 10 worst spills at about
35,000 tonnes, but resulted in major ecological damage.
In addition to these major slicks, it is estimated that an average of
2,000,000 tonnes is spilled into the world's seas every year. The
tanker, Aegean Sea, ran aground of La Coruna in northwest Spain in early
December, spilling 500,000 barrels of oil.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration yesterday blocked the proposed sale of controversial
chemicals plant technology to Iran by the US chemicals subsidiary of British
Petroleum (BP).
The rejection, which caught both BP and the State Department by surprise,
was announced by Mr Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary.
It followed reports yesterday that US government agencies remained divided
about the proposed sale because of concerns that Iran might be able to
develop chemical weapons with a hydrogen cyanide by-product of the BP
technology.
In Cleveland, Ohio, BP's US chemicals company said BP had not been notified
of any decision.
Mr Fitzwater said the decision to reject the sale to Iran had been taken a
month ago. But a state department official said he understood the BP
proposal and a separate US company proposal to sell aircraft for crop
dusting to Iran had both been scheduled for further discussion yesterday at
an inter-agency meeting. The State Department said, however, it would defer
to the White House on the issue.
Mr Tony Kozlowski of BP's US chemicals company said the company was first
approached 18 months ago by Fibchem, an Iranian fibre chemicals company.
He said BP subsequently consulted various US government agencies and was
told that there were no objections to the sale from the Commerce, Energy and
Defence Departments or from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The US is about to step up efforts to collect heavy weapons from armed

reports from Washington.
Mr Oakley said the move was possible 'now that we have more forces on the
ground and those forces have more mobility - helicopters for example, some
of which are just arriving this week'.
The extent to which US troops try to disarm the warring factions has been
the subject of debate between the Bush administration and the United
Nations. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has pressed
Washington to take a more activist role.

TAIWANESE legislators yesterday threatened to block a USDollars 6bn (Pounds
3.95bn) purchase of 150 F-16 jet fighters from the US unless Washington
agreed to transfer some production technology to the island, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
'We will kill the deal if the US does not agree to technology transfer,' Mr
Ting Shou-chung, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist party deputy in the
parliament's defence committee, said after a closed session to discuss the
government's budget request.
'It would be unthinkable and ridiculous if we did not have an offset
agreement to manufacture parts,' Mr Ting said.
Legislators said the defence ministry requested the first instalment of a
USDollars 6bn budget to buy the F-16 fighters. State radio said the money
would be paid over nine years and the first aircraft would be delivered in
40 months.
The US reversed a decade-old policy and agreed to sell the F-16s to Taiwan
last September despite strong protests by China, which claims sovereignty
over the island.
Mr Chen Li-an, defence minister, said the political sensitivity of the deal
made it impossible for Taiwan to obtain a commitment for technology transfer
from the aircraft's maker, General Dynamics, before the purchase was
completed.
The chairman of parliament's budget committee, Mr Liao Fuw-peen, criticised
the budget request. Mr Ting and Mr Chen said they were confident of having
enough support to block it.
Mr Ting noted that opposition in parliament was a major reason for last
year's collapse of a deal for Taiwan Aerospace Corp, partly owned by the
Taiwan government, to buy a stake in the operations of McDonnell Douglas for
USDollars 2bn.
The legislators and state radio said Mr Chen also requested an allocation of
funds for the purchase of 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters from France.
Taiwanese newspapers reported in November that a contract to buy 60 Mirages
for about USDollars 2.6bn had been signed in Taipei, though Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, France's trade and industry minister, has denied that the deal
had been finalised.
China has closed France's consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou and
cut French companies out of a USDollars 1bn subway contract there in
retaliation for the reported deal.
Taiwan's trade surplus plunged 29 per cent to an eight-year low of USDollars
9.48bn last year, slashed by rapidly rising imports and the global economic
slowdown, the finance ministry said yesterday.
Exports grew a moderate 7 per cent to USDollars 81.48bn, restrained by weak
demand in major foreign markets such as the US and Japan.
Imports surged 15 per cent to USDollars 72bn, boosted by a consumer spending
boom and purchases of materials and equipment for Taiwan's six-year,
USDollars 300bn infrastructure building plan.
In December alone, the trade surplus shrank 44 per cent from a year earlier
to USDollars 510m.
The 1992 surplus was the lowest since USDollars 8.5bn in 1984. Economists
predicted a figure between USDollars 7.5bn and USDollars 8bn.

Nima Jado holds a picture of her son Khaled Sbri Jado, a Palestinian

Israel said it would not alter its decision to expel 415 Palestinians to
Lebanon despite the threat of further action by the UN Security Council and
the despatch of a second UN envoy, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The government hopes the visit later this week of Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan,
special adviser to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, will
overcome the deadlock between Israel and Lebanon over the supply of
humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, stranded for almost three weeks in
no-man's land in south Lebanon. Officials also hope to use the visit to fend
off Arab demands for UN sanctions if Israel persists in ignoring Security
Council resolution 799 calling for reversal of the expulsions.
Israeli forces detained 17 relatives of a Palestinian suspected of
involvement in the killing of a secret service agent in Jerusalem on Sunday.
At least 15 other people were also held.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Indonesia budgets amid policy malaise: Unease about economic
direction in spite of the good numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Suharto announces Indonesia's annual budget tomorrow, he is
likely to paint 1992 as a year of consolidation setting the ground for a
renewed, if moderate, increase in growth. Behind the imperturbable face of
government, however, there is growing unease at the conduct of economic
policy.
The main indicators give the economy a rosy hue. Inflation has been cut by a
third in the past 12 months to about 6 per cent while the current account
deficit, Dollars 4.5bn in 1991, will have fallen to about Dollars 4bn last
year.
Indonesia's international debt held steady in 1992 at Dollars 78bn and 20
per cent growth in non-oil exports should prompt a fall in the debt service
ratio from 32 per cent of export proceeds last year.
Economists estimate Indonesia achieved gross domestic product growth of
about 5.75 per cent in 1992, down from 6.75 per cent a year earlier. A rise
to about 6.5 per cent is forecast for this year.
Mr Suharto's budget, however, will need to be a cautious one. Oil and gas
account for nearly 40 per cent of exports and a weakening oil market could
cause havoc with government finances. For every dollar drop in the price of
a barrel of oil, export revenue falls by Dollars 500m.
Pressures are rising on government expenditure, likely to be targeted at
about Rp62,000bn (Pounds 19.9bn) this year. Civil service wages have been
static for two years, so that a typical state employee with six years'
service receives just Rp56,000 a month, close to the minimum wage.
Demands for expenditure on overstretched infrastructure are increasing.
Above all, with 2m people entering the labour market every year, strong
growth is required to maintain social stability.
Since the mid-1980s, the government has adopted economic deregulation as a
means of promoting growth through the private sector. However, enthusiasm
for this may have passed.
Indonesia is still grappling with the effects of a 1988 package of financial
deregulation which led to a near doubling in the number of banks to more
than 200 and a concomitant growth in bank credit, offshore borrowing and new
investment.
Poor management and a lack of central supervision have left many banks
undercapitalised. And the level of non-performing loans - those on which no
interest has been paid for three months or more - is estimated by one donor
official at up to 20 per cent of the banking sector's assets. Central bank
officials say it is no more than 6 per cent.
Last month Bank Summa, the country's tenth-largest private bank, was ordered
into liquidation owing Rp1,600bn. Foreign bankers say lending limits to
Indonesia are being tightened and the cost of borrowing increased.
Government officials also concede actual investment in Indonesia has fallen
sharply (exact figures are not available) in the last year. Approvals in
1991 were Dollars 29bn.
Mr Adrianus Mooy, governor of Bank Indonesia, says the decline 'is the cost
we have to pay in the short run in order to achieve more sustainable
long-term growth'. However, with the opening up of southern China and
Vietnam, the fall in investment may be longer-term.
Donors, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, are pressing the
government to respond with further deregulation.
But the problems with the financial sector have strengthened the hand of
those arguing for state intervention and a controlled business environment
for the private sector.
Deregulation last year was piecemeal. Foreigners were allowed to own 100 per
cent of new projects but, on the main island of Java, only if they invested
more than Dollars 50m.
Sectors of the economy such as cement, steel, sugar, wheat, rice, and cloves
 -the essential ingredient in Indonesia's kretek cigarettes - remain heavily
influenced by government or dominated by politically well-connected private
companies.
Moves to attract private sector involvement in infrastructure projects have
also faltered. Negotiations over the Dollars 2bn Paiton power plant in East
Java have yet to be concluded, seven months after Mission Energy of the US
won approval for the project.
The contract to expand the congested main port of Tanjung Priok has been
delayed while a proposal by the Humpuss Group, controlled by Mr Suharto's
youngest son, to run the port is considered.
Diplomats say Mr Suharto is receiving conflicting advice from ministers
promoting themselves prior to a cabinet reshuffle in March.
In one ear he is told to confront project delays and economic weaknesses by
strengthening central decision-making. In the other he hears that the
failings of deregulation are the result of economic technocrats having
insufficient autonomy, while central interference is obstructing essential
projects.
The message from the business community is more succinct. As the head of one
conglomerate puts it, until the direction of economic policy is clear, 'I've
told my staff, no more investment'.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Japan's vehicle registrations decline by 7.2%

MOTOR vehicle registrations in Japan fell 7.2 per cent last year, the second
consecutive year of decline, highlighting the impact of the economic
slowdown and the increasing pressure for a restructuring of an overcrowded
car industry.
The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said total sales were 5.33m, with
sales of passenger cars, excluding mini-cars, down 8.6 per cent to 3.68m
units, marking the first yearly fall since 1981.
Eight of the country's 11 vehicle makers reported a downturn in sales last
year, while sales of imported cars slipped 7.7 per cent to 184,616 units.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic
organisations, said the government should consider new measures to stimulate
the flagging economy if the slowdown continues into the spring. He said the
government may need to remedy the stock market weakness, which has
undermined business confidence.
The Electronic Industries Association of Japan also highlighted the
difficulties facing the country's leading manufacturers by announcing that
domestic shipments of colour television sets fell 11.9 per cent in November,
compared with the same month in 1991.
Electronics makers were particularly surprised by a 24 per cent fall in
shipments of large-size televisions, on which they had based hopes of a
recovery in consumer demand for higher-priced products. Video cassette
recorder shipments were down 19.9 per cent, while shipments of
high-performance VCRs fell 40.5 per cent.
Daihatsu, the maker of mini-vehicles and commercial vehicles, reported a
28.5 per cent fall in sales by volume, while Toyota saw a 5.4 per cent
decline and Nissan 10.8 per cent. Mitsubishi Motors said its sales were 3
per cent higher, while Suzuki reported a 19 per cent increase.
In December, passenger car sales fell 8.1 per cent on a year earlier, while
truck sales were 8.4 per cent lower. Bus sales fell 30 per cent.

FT  06 JAN 93 / S Korean economy likely to grow 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean economy is expected to improve this year, with the current
account deficit shrinking and prices stabilising.
Government agencies and private institutes predict that gross national
product growth will be around 6 per cent in 1993 against last year's 4.9 per
cent, the worst economic performance since the country's 1980 recession.
The Economic Planning Board, (EPB), the government's senior economic agency,
estimates that 7 per cent is the optimal growth rate for South Korea. Higher
growth would trigger excessive inflationary pressure.
The expected acceleration in this year's growth will depend on increased
industrial investments and growing exports as the global economy recovers.
The growth in industrial investment slowed to 0.8 per cent in 1992,
reflecting weaker business confidence, after averaging more than 15 per cent
annually during the previous two years.
The government recently announced measures to stimulate investment,
including lifting the ceiling on foreign currency loans for the purchase of
imported machinery and providing state loans of Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.2bn)
for domestic machinery and plant construction.
'The currently flat investment situation, if prolonged, is expected to
seriously threaten the nation's economic growth potential in the next couple
of years,' said Mr Choi Gak-kyu, the deputy prime minister and EPB director.
He estimated that industrial investment could increase by 5 per cent in 1993
as a result of the new measures.
A recent survey of the country's big industrial groups found that most are
planning to boost investment in the belief that export demand will improve.
The election last month of Mr Kim Young-sam as Korea's next president also
restored business confidence by removing the political uncertainty that had
dampened capital spending. Increased investments will be primarily directed
to the electronic, automotive and semiconductor industries.
Restrictions on construction, which were imposed last year to curb
inflation, have also been recently lifted.
Exports are expected to increase by 8 per cent as Korean companies expand
markets in developing countries, particularly China and South-East Asia, to
compensate for slower demand in the US, Japan and the EC.
The rise in exports, combined with lower imports, should almost eliminate
the trade deficit on a balance of payments basis, although it will amount to
Dollars 3.5bn on a customs clearance basis compared with Dollars 4.9bn last
year, said the ministry of trade and industry.
This should help reduce the current account deficit to Dollars 3bn against
Dollars 4.5bn in 1992.
Concerns remain about inflation, although the 1992 rate of 4.5 per cent was
the lowest since 1986, when prices rose 1.3 per cent.
It remains unclear whether President-elect Kim will agree to the present
tight monetary policy or instead ease credit controls in response to
business demands.
Most forecasts estimate an inflation rate of around 5 per cent if the stable
growth policy continues.
The EPB wants to slow expansion of the money supply to between 13 per cent
and 17 per cent from last year's 18.5 per cent.
It plans to mollify business worries about a possible recession by lowering
interest rates to a target rate of 12 per cent from last year's peak of 19
per cent through deregulation and more loans for industrial investment.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday expressed concern at Iraq's deployment of additional
anti-aircraft missiles in the southern no-fly zone, and White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Washington was considering how to respond,
Reuter reports from Washington.
'We're monitoring the missiles. We're very concerned. We're still
considering our options,' Mr Fitzwater said during a visit to the US
military academy at West Point, New York, with President George Bush. The US
Defence Department said Iraq had moved extra surface-to-air missiles into
the southern no-fly zone, where an American fighter jet shot down an Iraqi
MiG fighter last month.
The Pentagon warned Iraq against turning on the missile targeting radars
against US reconnaissance and fighter aircraft policing the area south of
the 32nd parallel where Iraqi aircraft have been banned.
Mr Fitzwater did not say what types of options were under consideration.
However US defence officials said there was concern that the movement of the
missiles might signal an attempt by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to shoot
down an American warplane in the area.
The US, Britain and France set up the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel
last year to keep Mr Saddam's aircraft from attacking dissident Shia in the
south.
Iraqi aircraft have violated the zone repeatedly in recent weeks and a US
F-16 fighter shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 fighter over the zone on December 27.
Iraq said later it reserved the right to respond. But Baghdad gave no
details on whether or how it might retaliate.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Somali peace talks end in deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS-chaired Somali peace talks ended last night in deadlock, with
the 15 participating clan-based factions reaching no agreement and with
acrimonious charges made against the UN by Somali warlords.
Delegates said informal talks would continue today after Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary general, left Addis Ababa. The move reflected the
determination of four allied factions to stall any successful agreement
while the conference was still under UN sponsorship which might reflect
positively on the UN chief.
Mr Boutros Ghali last night played down the failure of the talks and
criticisms of him by some Somali factions.
'What we have achieved is not enough but it is a positive step,' he said.
'For the first time the leaders have met and mechanism has been created.'
The UN chief said nobody was interested in creating a trusteeship in Somalia
and he issued a stern warning to Somali leaders stalling on political
reconciliation at a time when Africa was increasingly marginalised by a
post-cold war world. If they were not careful, he said, the world would
withdraw from Somalia and plunge the country into a worse 'drama.'
'It was not easy to obtain the involvement of the international community to
help Somalia and the international community could in 24 hours just forget
Somalia. Nobody is interested in Somalia. The world is no longer interested
in the poor countries of Africa.'
In another critical test of UN capability in ushering in a 'new world order'
the UN has emerged bruised and is now faced with having to reconsider its
long-term political role in Somalia. The UN and Mr Boutros Ghali have also
been hard pressed to fight attempts by warlords to exploit real and imagined
divisions between the UN and the US.
In a statement distributed to the conference yesterday Gen Mohamed Farah
Aideed, Somalia's most important warlord, said on behalf of his Somali
National Alliance (SNA) that 'UN bureaucrats, from the secretary general
downwards, have failed time and again to demonstrate an understanding of the
intricate political problems in Somalia.'
Gen Aideed attacked the organisation of the political conference by Mr
Boutros Ghali and questioned the UN's ability and impartiality.
Even before the conference started Gen Aideed had tried to undermine the UN.
On Sunday, he organised an angry demonstration against Mr Boutros Ghali
during his humiliating visit to Mogadishu. Gen Aideed and his other
clan-based faction allies spent most of the conference filibustering -
determined to frustrate efforts at agreement on a national political
reconciliation conference. Eleven other factions had agreed to a proposal
calling for the convening of the reconciliation conference within 60 days in
Mogadishu, if security conditions permitted.
Delegates of the 11 factions said they were increasingly frustrated by Gen
Aideed's negative position and would soon consider going it alone.
Meanwhile, one UN official said privately the UN was now forced to consider
whether it should withdraw its political bureau from Mogadishu. 'If getting
Somalis to the peace table means getting out of Somalia then we will get
out.'
UN officials say they are dealing with the legacy of their involvement in
Somalia which has inevitably created enemies among the warlords who face
losing their power base.
But critics say the UN is reaping the harvest of its earlier neglect of
Somalia.
'What gave Boutros Ghali, the Organisation of African Unity and the League
of Arab States the right to sit on the dais and open a peace conference on
Somalia?' asked Mr Hassan Mahdi, a member of the SNA delegation. 'They did
nothing when we were suffering most.' Many US officials privately share the
warlords' criticisms of the shortcomings of the UN. They point to their own
rapid successes.

American trade officials yesterday were said to be mulling over potential US

George Bush, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Mr Bush, apparently determined to 'leave the desk clean' when he turns over

meet the January 15 deadline he last month set with British Prime Minister
John Major for final resolution of the most important issues.
After signing the Start 2 nuclear arms accord in Russia at the weekend, the
president stopped off in Paris to discuss the General Agreement on Tariffs

little headway.
At the same time, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, met Sir Leon

THE round of Somali peace talks which ended yesterday has exposed the
shortcomings of United Nations peacemaking efforts and underlined
difficulties facing the world body in arranging an accord in the deeply
fragmented country.
In another critical test of UN capability in dealing with the cold war
legacy and ushering in a 'new world order' the UN has emerged bruised and
and is now faced with having to reconsider its long-term political role in
Somalia.
The UN and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, its secretary general, have also been
hard pressed to fight attempts by Somali warlords to exploit real and
imagined divisions be-tween the UN and the US and drive a wedge between the
two.
In a statement distributed to the conference yesterday Gen Mohamed Farah
Aideed, Somalia's most important warlord, said on behalf of his Somali
National Alliance (SNA) that 'UN bureaucrats, from the secretary general
downwards, have failed time and again to demonstrate an understanding of the
intricate political problems in Somalia.'
Gen Aideed attacked the organisation of the political conference by Mr
Boutros Ghali and questioned the UN's ability and impartiality.
Even before the conference started Gen Aideed was trying to undermine the
UN. On Sunday, the day before the official opening, he organised an angry
and unpleasant demonstration against Mr Boutros Ghali during his humiliating
visit to Mogadishu. Gen Aideed and his other clan-based faction leaders have
spent most of the conference filibustering - determined to frustrate efforts
at agreement on a national political reconciliation conference before Mr
Boutros Ghali departs today.
Senior UN officials said yesterday that since Sunday's visit the UN has
received further violent threats against its personnel who are based in the
southern part of the city controlled by Gen Aideed.
One UN official said privately the UN was now forced to consider whether it
should withdraw its political bureau from Mogadishu. 'If getting Somalis to
the peace table means getting out of Somalia then we will get out,' he said.
UN officials say they are dealing with the legacy of their involvement in
Somalia which has inevitably created enemies among the warlords who face
losing their power base.
But critics say the UN is reaping the harvest of its neglect of Somalia
during 1991 when the country first slid into anarchy and starvation, and its
subsequent inefficiency in re-establishing security for a humanitarian
operation.
'What gave Boutros Ghali, the Organisation of African Unity and the League
of Arab States the right to sit on the dais and open a peace conference on
Somalia?' asked Mr Hassan Mahdi, a member of the SNA delegation. 'They did
nothing when we were suffering most and are now they are trying to jump on
the bandwagon of American success.'
Many US officials privately share the warlords' criticisms of the
shortcomings of the UN. They point to their own rapid successes made in the
past month since US troops first landed in Somalia including restoring
relative order, gearing up a massive relief effort and brokering the first
serious peace talks in Mogadishu.
Serious divisions have emerged between the US and the UN. Mr Boutros Ghali
has tried unsuccessfully to pressure the US to disarm the factions.
Differences have also emerged over plans for the handover from the US-led
operation to one led by the UN.
Some State Department officials clearly believe that they are better able to
guide Somalia to peace and reconstruction and are privately hoping that
President-elect Bill Clinton will give them an expanded remit in Somalia
when he moves into the White House this month.
Publicly, US officials continue to say that they are fully committed to the
UN.
Gen Aideed, however, believes the differences are real and can be exploited
to his advantage. 'The SNA hopes and expects major donor countries,
especially the United States, would reassess their positions vis-a-vis the
UN and the Somali crisis,' Gen Aideed said.
For some reason Gen Aideed and his allies believe US oversight of the peace
process offers them the best hope of maintaining their power. Somali critics
say the US operation has fuelled these beliefs by basing itself in the part
of the city Gen Aideed controls and forging links with his main financier,
Mr Osman Arto.
Some angry UN officials allege privately that the US is encouraging the
anti-UN camp, and as a concession to Gen Aideed has breached a number of
agreements, such as operating under a UN flag and providing proper security
to the UN. They say the talks in Mogadishu should have been organised on UN
soil instead of being arranged by the US special envoy at the US embassy.
'At this critical moment the US, the major player, is sitting on the fence
watching us struggle,' complained a UN official.
Few observers expect the ambiguity of the UN-US relationship to be clarified
before Mr Clinton takes office. But in the meantime the UN has suffered a
further loss of credibility at the peace conference which might hamper its
future efforts at peacemaking.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Bush backs force to ensure 'new world order'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday proclaimed his belief in 'the selective
use of military force for selective purposes' in order to ensure that a new
world democratic order was sustained.
But he insisted that it would be a 'waste of resources' for the US to assume
the role of global policeman. Other nations must contribute militarily and
economically whenever 'their interests are at stake'.
In a farewell address to the cadets of the US Military Academy at West
Point, New York, Mr Bush sought to lay out his thoughts on the use of force
which, he said, could serve as 'a complement to diplomacy or as a temporary
alternative to it'.
He cited the Gulf war and the current operation in Somalia as two examples
of this use. Humanitarian concerns, as in Somalia, meant 'we should not
stand by when the modest use of force can make an immediate difference'.
But he argued that any decision not to use force could also be valid. In
former Yugoslavia, for example, 'up to now it has not been clear that the
use of limited amounts of force would have had the desired effects given the
complexities of that situation'. He warned, however, that circumstances in
the Balkans could change.
Mr Bush cautioned against drawing up too rigid a set of rules whereby
international military intervention might be determined. Instead he
preferred 'principles' and 'guidelines', though he offered no details as to
what these might contain.
He added that ideally nations should use force 'in concert' but
international agreement on such deployments, while desirable, should not be
an absolute 'prerequisite'.
There would be occasions, he said, when the US might want to act
unilaterally, as it had in Panama when it determined its own vital interests
were at stake. But, he went on: 'The fact that America can act does not mean
that it must.'
He was mostly at pains to emphasise the new challenges of the post-cold war
era which, he said, was 'unfortunately' still fraught with 'the spectre of
war'. In this climate: 'I cannot say that the demands on the US will
diminish.'
For all the hope attendant on the end of the cold war, 'the new world order
simply won't emerge on its own'. The US could not remain 'passive and aloof'
from events far from its shore, he said.
The speech was consciously designed to address the criticism that foreign
policy had been given no coherent framework since Mr Bush first coined the
term 'new world order' more than two years ago.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Crisis manager at the NY Fed: The career of Gerald Corrigan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT you see here is what you get. There is no hidden story, no hidden
agenda. There are no problems, no policy disputes. I am in excellent health.
. . I have no interest in any kind of appointment with the Clinton
administration.'
It was with this characteristic bluntness that Mr E. Gerald Corrigan, the
51-year-old president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, yesterday
discussed his decision to step down next August from one of the most
influential jobs in central banking.
The burly Mr Corrigan, at times verging on the emotional, insisted at a
press conference that the chief reason for his decision was 'a strong desire
to pursue a career in the private sector' after spending 25 years working in
the Federal Reserve system.
Wall Street, where he is highly respected, was inclined to take him at his
word.
He will leave behind a reputation as one of the most important fighters in
recent years, protecting both US and international banking from systemic
risk and playing a key behind-the-scenes role in preventing the 1987 stock
market crash threatening the entire US financial system.
However, this big, abrasive man, with a booming voice and a penchant for
keeping his cards close to his chest, also has his critics.
Some congressional Democrats have criticised his handling of the collapse of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, while in the wake of 1991's
Treasury bond scandal at Salomon Brothers the New York Fed was attacked for
failing adequately to supervise primary bond market dealers.
He is not a great friend of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board
chairman who nevertheless yesterday hailed his 'extraordinary career in
central banking and public service'.
A protege and close friend of Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, Mr Corrigan said the timing of his announcement was
predicated on his belief 'that the economy and the financial system are
clearly on the mend in a setting in which the progress that has been made in
winding down inflation is plain for all to see'.
He admitted he intended to 'strap on my waders' and spend much of next
summer fishing in the Madison River near 'a little place I bought out in
Montana'.
Asked to list his successes and failures, Mr Corrigan noted that he had
helped to put 'the inflation genie back in the bottle'. He also claimed
credit for getting financial institutions and market practitioners to focus
on what he called 'the plumbing' of finance. And with a wry smile Mr
Corrigan, a harsh critic of America's 1980s borrowing spree, also noted that
'debt is now a four-letter word again'.
Looking back he admitted the 1987 stock market crash on Wall Street was 'a
tough one'. He bemoaned the fact that the US budget deficit was so large and
that 'we have been unable to develop a framework or the political will to
modernise our banking system'.
Mr Corrigan has also played an important international role as chairman
since July 1991 of the Basle committee on banking supervision. He plans to
continue for the forseeable future his work as co-chairman of the recently
launched Russian American Bankers Forum, which is aimed at helping Moscow
develop its banking system.

ITALY yesterday denied it was imposing a block on car imports from Japan and
Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it had been
assured by the Italian government no such action was being taken.
Miti said it had been confused by conflicting statements from the Italian
government after inconclusive talks in Tokyo last month between the EC and
Miti.
Fresh uncertainties also appeared to be raised over Italy's view of Japanese
cars built inside the EC - mainly in the UK.
Italy's foreign trade ministry said its minister, Mr Claudio Vitalone, had
been 'misinterpreted' by newspapers on action Italy was taking. 'There will
be stricter monitoring of Japanese imports,' said Mr Renigio Cavedon, a
ministry spokesman. Import levels would be reported immediately from
frontier points. If the authorities found imports were 'much higher' than in
the past, Italy would request the Commission to take action, he said. But
there was no question of imports being blocked. The ministry indicated that
the stepped up 'controls' of Japanese imports would include vehicles
produced at Japanese-owned plants in the EC. Such 'transplants' should in
theory be allowed free access to EC countries under the single market.
'We can't stop the UK-made Japanese cars,' said Mr Cavedon. 'But obviously,
if 100,000 Japanese cars flooded into Italy, that would have serious
consequences for the domestic motor industry.'
December's talks to agree the overall number of vehicles shipped from Japan
to the EC this year under an EC-Japan 'understanding' are expected to resume
later this month.
Importers themselves appeared confused over Italian government plans. Nissan
in Italy said it believed imports were blocked 'for the time being', but
admitted the company had not yet experienced any hold-ups. Around 90 per
cent of Nissans sold in Italy are produced at its Sunderland plant in the
UK.
The agreement between the EC and Miti allowed for 56,000 Japanese imports
into Italy last year. The figure included 'transplants'.

<TEXT>
AUTOMOBILES Peugeot, the French car maker, said yesterday it would cut 2,597
jobs this year, its biggest workforce reduction since 1988, writes William
Dawkins in Paris. The company blamed declining European demand for cars.
The move, the latest in a series of job cuts across French industry, is part
of Peugeot's strategy to increase productivity by 12 per cent a year. This
is needed to close the gap between itself and Japanese car makers before
they win free access to European markets from 1999.
The job losses represent a 5 per cent reduction of the 50,000-strong
payroll.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry and trade minister, said the government
was continuing to study plans for closer links between Renault, the
state-owned car group, and Volvo, its Swedish partner.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Kosovo PM seeks help for Serbia's 'next target': A warning
of war spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strong showing of ultra-nationalists in Serbian elections last month set
alarm bells ringing from Moscow to Washington over the heightened danger of
war spreading to Macedonia and Kosovo. Sceptics, on the other hand, said an
over-stretched Serbia was unlikely to risk it.
Mr Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the self-declared Republic of Kosova, as
ethnic Albanians call what used to be the Yugoslav autonomous province of
Kosovo before its re-integration into Serbia by Serbian leader Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, is not so sanguine.
'Serbia is well armed and able to fight not just on two but on five fronts
at the same time,' he says. 'The Serbs are not mad, but they continue to do
irrational things.'
In London as part of a tour of European capitals, Mr Bukoshi says his aim is
'to alarm the civilised world and prevent conflict spilling over to Kosovo
as the next target of Serbian aggression'.
'The situation in Kosovo is much more tense after elections which brought
criminals like Zeljko Raznjatovic (better known as 'Commander Arkan') and
Vojislav Seselj of the ultra-nationalist Radical party into top positions in
the Serbian government,' he adds.
As 'an urgent first step' he calls for the despatch of several thousand UN
forces to Kosovo, where it has only 16 observers.
Mr Bukoshi, a 45-year-old doctor now based in Germany, was chosen as prime
minister after clandestine multi-party elections last May.
The election in the Serbia poll of the two ultra-nationalists recently named
as 'war criminals' by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state,
confirms that Serbia is seeking a Nazi-style 'final solution' in Kosovo, Mr
Bukoshi warns. Both men were involved in the worst of 'ethnic cleansing' in
Croatia and Bosnia and openly threaten to expel ethnic Albanians who make up
90 per cent of the 1.9m population of Kosovo, and reclaim the medieval
Serbian kingdom, he adds.
Mass expulsion of unarmed ethnic Albanians would almost certainly lead to
large-scale violence which would increase pressure on western leaders to
intervene, partly to forestall military support from fellow-Moslem countries
and the spread of the Yugoslav war to Albania, with unpredictable
consequences for the region.
'The Serbs are demanding historical rights, the rights of those dead for 500
years, while suppressing the human rights of those who live there now,' he
argues. 'It is absurd to ignore 500 years of Ottoman rule. The Serbs only
regained Kosovo in the 1912 Balkan war, and now they are also preparing
'ethnic cleansing' in territories like Vojvodina, with 400,000 ethnic
Hungarians and other minorities. But Vojvodina was never part of historical
Serbia, and only ceded by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.'
Faced with armed oppression, Kosovars have created a parallel state, with a
clandestinely elected president, prime minister and parliament, as well as
underground schools and hospitals. It is a tactic pioneered by Solidarity in
Poland under martial law.
Part of the aim has been to prevent anger spilling over into open revolt and
giving the Serbs an excuse for further repression. 'We deserve the Nobel
prize for patience,' says Mr Bukoshi wryly. 'But the international community
must now help us to breathe freely. Our autonomy, our schools, our elemental
human rights, everything has been taken away. We are treated like animals to
be exterminated.'
Unlike Poles, who were repressed by a Polish general to pre-empt possible
Soviet occupation, Kosovars are at the mercy of alien forces. The 200,000
ethnic Serbs left in Kosovo are well armed and organised in para-military
units. Serb garrisons dominate many towns and villages and control roads,
railways, Pristina airport, and the hills surrounding villages. Serb forces
are also massed just over the Serbian and Montenegrin borders.
The oppression is not only military. More than 85 per cent of Albanian
Kosovars have lost their jobs, forcing the community back on family
solidarity and the fertile land which provides 70 per cent of their food.
Above all they rely on remittances from nearly 250,000 Kosovars working
mainly in Germany and Switzerland.
Corruption is rife, Mr Bukoshi says. Serb police and para-military shake
down returning Gastarbeiter, confiscate goods and hidden money and then sell
both on the black market.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Car chiefs to lobby Clinton on petrol tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR industry executives and union leaders are to meet Governor Bill
Clinton in Arkansas for talks that are sure to raise speculation the
president-elect may be preparing to reverse his opposition to higher petrol
taxes.
Mr Clinton will meet the chief executives of the three leading US car
makers, as well as Mr Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers
trade union, to discuss economic and motor industry issues, including health
care costs and the burden of government regulation.
But Mr Alexander Trotman, head of Ford Motor's worldwide car operations,
said his company would use the meeting to press its case for higher petrol
taxes - a case backed by Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, at the economic
conference Mr Clinton hosted in Little Rock last month.
The idea of increased US petrol taxes, which are low by international
standards, has gained support in recent months from a surprising coalition
of fiscal conservatives, environmentalists, carmakers and international
economists.
Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's principal rival last year for the Democratic
party's presidential nomination, argued for higher petrol taxes as a way to
reduce the federal budget deficit, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent
candidate, urged an increase of 10 cents a gallon for each of the next five
years.
But Mr Clinton is reluctant to adopt such a measure, which he says would
weigh unduly on the middle class. Although last month he opened the door for
balancing higher petrol taxes against other tax breaks for the middle class,
he said he regarded an increase of 15 cents a gallon as excessive.
Every additional 1 cent would raise about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) a year
of extra revenue, although the precise effects on US driving habits and fuel
consumption are hard to gauge.
The car manufacturers are latecomers to the coalition, but their support for
higher petrol taxes is contingent on relief from the current Corporate
Average Fuel Efficiency rules, which seek to lower petrol consumption by
obliging car companies to achieve an average of 27.5 miles per gallon with
their models.
The US vehicle market is recovering slowly from recession and analysts
expect car and light truck sales to grow 7-8 per cent in 1993, to about
13.7m, writes Martin Dickson from New York. That compares with growth of 15
per cent or more in previous economic recoveries.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Flying into flak over fish and Falklands: UK cabinet
minister makes first trip to Argentina since 1982
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd arrives in Buenos Aires this morning,
the first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland
Islands conflict, he will fly into a barrage of inflated expectations.
The Falklands may have become a peripheral issue in Britain, but Argentina
remains obsessed with the islands and clearly hopes that Mr Hurd's five-day
visit will signify another step on the tortuous road to 'recovering' the
islands, this time through diplomatic means.
The British have publicly disabused their hosts of any belief that the
Falklands is up for negotiation. Mr Hurd told Argentina's La Nacion
newspaper at the weekend: 'I do not expect, and neither should you, that my
visit will set in motion any great advances.'
Instead, he said, his visit would be devoted to further consolidating
Britain's improving links with Argentina.
Britain and Argentina re-established diplomatic relations in 1990, a year
after President Carlos Menem took office. Since then relations have improved
steadily to the point where they co-operated militarily during the 1991 Gulf
war. Britain is assigning greater importance to its relations with Latin
America, and Mr Menem's free market and pro-western policies have made
Argentina an increasingly visible reference point in the region.
The economy has settled down to rapid growth and its privatisation policies
have involved British banks, consultancy firms and industrial companies, the
most notable being British Gas's leading position in the consortium which
took control of the Buenos Aires gas distribution company last month.
Argentina has also opened up its secretive atomic establishment and scrapped
its Condor II missile project. Britain and the US viewed both projects with
great suspicion as a source of proliferation. At the same time Argentina has
sent troops as UN peacekeepers to the Gulf and Yugoslavia, for reasons of
prestige and to keep its habitually restive troops busy.
That still leaves the awkward question of the Falklands. Buenos Aires
continues to press a claim to the islands, despite the humiliating defeat of
1982. Equally, Britain refuses to discuss sovereignty formulas. Both have
agreed to disagree over sovereignty, but cannot agree on how to manage
shared resources, especially oil and fisheries.
There have been some advances. Seismic tests for oil will be carried out in
Falklands waters this year by two companies. The two sides have also worked
out a fisheries conservation agreement for 1993, and are now working on a
more permanent arrangement. UK and Argentine scientists have started joint
research on fish conservation.
Curiously, the illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the
centre of a dispute which islanders see as a continuation of the 1982
conflict by other means.
The islands have become one of the richest spots on earth by selling
licences to Far Eastern squid-fishing fleets. But in December, Argentina
announced it would start issuing cut-price licences of its own, breaking the
Falklands' monopoly.
The move is expected in Port Stanley to deprive the islands of half or more
of the Pounds 30m a year in revenues from licence sales. Some two-third of
the islands' revenues come from licensing.
Provided the Argentine decision has a commercial, rather than predatory,
motivation, the British government is virtually powerless to influence the
move.
However, Mr Hurd has warned that attempts to use squid licences as
'political toys' could threaten wider bilateral relations.
Mr Hurd, who travels on to Chile, will be pressed to invite Mr Menem on an
official visit to London. Mr Menem himself first asked to be invited to the
UK over a year ago. But there is little sign that an invitation will be
forthcoming.

FT  06 JAN 93 / US stops BP chemical technology sale to Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration yesterday blocked the proposed sale of controversial
chemicals plant technology to Iran by the US chemicals subsidiary of British
Petroleum (BP).
The rejection, which caught both BP and the State Department by surprise,
was announced by Mr Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary. It
followed reports yesterday morning that US government agencies remained
divided about the proposed sale because of concerns that Iran might be able
to develop chemical weapons with a hydrogen cyanide by-product of the BP
technology.
In Cleveland, BP's US chemicals company said BP had not been notified of any
decision.
Mr Fitzwater said the decision to reject the sale to Iran had been taken a
month ago. But a State Department official said he understood the BP
proposal and a separate US company proposal to sell aircraft for crop
dusting to Iran had both been scheduled for further discussion yesterday at
an inter-agency meeting. The State Department said, however, it would defer
to the White House on the issue.
Mr Tony Kozlowski of BP's US chemicals company in Cleveland, Ohio, said the
company was first approached 18 months ago by Fibchem, an Iranian fibre
chemicals company. He said BP subsequently consulted various US government
agencies and was told there were no objections to the sale from the
Commerce, Energy and Defence Departments or from the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA).
Some officials at the State Department had apparently opposed the sale on
the grounds that it could help Iran's effort to develop a series of chemical
weapons.
The technology proposed for sale by BP included blueprints, plans, technical
assistance, training and catalysts needed to build a chemical plant at
Bandar Imam that would produce acrylonitrile, a base chemical used in the
manufacture of synthetic fibres. The value of the proposed transaction was
believed to be less than Dollars 50m.
BP said it was seeking to address concerns as it continued its application
for an export licence from the Commerce Department. The company said the
cyanide by-product could, however, be obtained on the open market.
Congressional critics have worked behind the scenes to oppose the proposed
transaction. Mr Yossef Bodansky, director of the House Republican task force
on terrorism and unconventional warfare, said yesterday he was pleased at
the rejection. He said the chemical by-product was 'a very fast-acting nerve
agent that is extremely effective for battlefield use'.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Republican rift hits Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle between centrists and right-wingers for control of the Republican
party has spread to Congress, with the resignation of a leading moderate
from the party leadership.
Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin said he would not serve as chief
deputy whip in the new Congress as he expected the right-wingers who
dominate the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to adopt
a strategy of 'rigid confrontation and opposition' to President-elect Bill
Clinton.
'There is no question the House Republican leadership is becoming
increasingly hard-right. I do not believe our present leadership represents
mainstream Republicans in this country or even in the Congress,' said Mr
Gunderson, an economic conservative who is more centrist on many social
issue.
In elections for leadership positions last month, the House Republican
caucus ousted the moderate Congressman Jerry Lewis of California from the
chairmanship of their Republican Conference, the party's third-ranking post,
in favour of Congressman Richard Armey of Texas, a more pugnacious
right-winger.
In addition, Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, an argumentative
conservative who is principally known as an anti-abortion crusader, took
over the chairmanship of the Republican policy comm-ittee.
But the conflict in the House mirrors a broader struggle for control of the
Republican party in the wake of President George Bush's election defeat - a
struggle that will come to a preliminary climax later this month when the
party elects a new chairman, but which is unlikely to be resolved entirely
before the 1996 presidential primaries.
Moderates have complained that the party presented a narrow and divisive
image of itself at its convention last summer in Houston, giving prominent
speaking roles to right-wingers like Mr Pat Buchanan and Christian
fundamentalists such as Mr Pat Robertson.
Mr Gunderson, like most of the other generally moderate Republican
congressmen from his state, stayed away from the Houston convention and
criticised the image of intolerance contained in some of the speeches there.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTCOME of the Bosnian peace talks and possible outside military
intervention in the conflict may hang on today's meeting in Belgrade between
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the former
Yugoslavia, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Milosevic, whom many believe to be backing Bosnian Serb aggression in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, will be told Bosnian Serbs must drop their demand for a
'state-within-a-state' that could later be linked with a Greater Serbia. Mr
Vance and Lord Owen regard this demand as the principal obstacle to a
Bosnian settlement, and have said that if the talks break down they will not
hesitate to name the party responsible.
This would make almost inevitable some kind of UN-sanctioned military action
against the Bosnian Serbs and perhaps Serbia itself, initially through
enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Vance and Lord Owen, said yesterday that
Mr Milosevic was 'a key player' and 'in a position to push this peace
process home'. He added: 'Time is running out in terms of what the
international community is willing to live with.'
The first session of talks between the warring Serb, Croat and mainly Moslem
government factions adjourned on Monday evening, after Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb chief, said he needed to consult Serbian leaders, including
Mr Milosevic. The negotiations are due to resume on Sunday.

<TEXT>
MR George Soros, the international financier who made a billion dollars
during sterling's fall last September, has initiated a Dollars 25m (Pounds
16.4m) revolving loan for Macedonia, intended initially to cover the
beleaguered former Yugoslav republic's oil requirements for the rest of the
winter, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The loan follows Mr Soros's Christmas donation of Dollars 50m from his
currency profits to international relief organisations working in Bosnia.
Mr Soros had to cancel plans to announce the loan yesterday in a speech to
the Macedonian parliament because a snowstorm had shut down Skopje airport.
However, government officials said the first instalment, in the form of
70,000 tonnes of crude oil, was on its way.
Although Macedonia is exempted from United Nations sanctions against Serbia
and Montenegro, fuel supplies have run low. Because Macedonia has not been
officially recognised by the European Community or the US it has no access
to commercial credit or to financial aid from international organisations.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Belgium may need emergency steps to trim budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM may have to introduce new emergency measures next month to bring its
large budget deficit back in line with criteria for monetary union in the
Maastricht treaty.
The government yesterday announced, as expected, that it had overshot its
original target for the 1992 deficit by nearly BFr30bn (Pounds 608m). The
deficit increased from BFr367.6bn to BFr382.5bn, compared with a forecast of
BFr354.8bn, after economic conditions deteriorated.
Government officials said yesterday that once Belgium's regional and
community authorities had submitted their figures for 1992, the overall
deficit for last year could reach 6.8 or 6.9 per cent of gross national
product (GNP).
Those figures, inflated by statistical adjustments, are higher than forecast
and well out of line with the Maastricht target - a deficit of 3 per cent of
GNP by 1996.
The officials added that it was likely the government's 1993 target (a
deficit of 5.2 per cent of GNP) might have to be increased.
Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition has narrowly survived political and
economic pressures since its formation in March last year. The government is
now pinning its hopes on a cut in German interest rates, which would relieve
the pressure on Belgium to introduce emergency budget measures next month.
A Treasury official said yesterday: 'Given the very negative business
climate, we consider we have succeeded in limiting the deterioration (of the
deficit).'
But Mr Peter Praet, chief economist with Generale de Banque, one of
Belgium's biggest banks, warned yesterday that the government now had little
room to manoeuvre.
'Because growth figures are being revised down, if rates don't come down
quickly and strongly, the target of 5.2 per cent will be impossible,' he
declared.

FT  06 JAN 93 / French change tack in fight for franc: Bank has wheeled out
a new weapon against speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past two months the Bank of France has spent heavily to protect the
French franc against attacks by market speculators.
Yesterday it changed tactics. The bank suspended its 10 per cent 5-10 day
rate - the one used by investors hedging against potential losses on their
short-term sales of the French currency. The bank replaced it with a one-day
lending facility at 12 per cent. These measures should - or so the bank
hopes - make it more difficult and expensive to speculate against the franc.
However, the bank's new strategy has wider implications. It could force the
commercial banks to raise their base rates to offset the indirect increase
in their borrowing costs, thereby intensifying the pressure on the rest of
the French economy.
'These changes will undoubtedly make the Paris market less liquid and should
have some effect in easing the pressure on the franc,' said Mr Christopher
Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez. 'But this is really just another
stage in the battle to support the franc.'
Whether these measures, which would almost certainly have been implemented
after consultation with the government, will trigger an increase in base
rates depends on how money market rates respond. French market rates have
been rising steadily for the past month. The overnight rate moved from 10
per cent in early December to 12 per cent at the start of this week.
Yesterday, it jumped as high as 15 per cent.
This has made it more expensive for the commercial banks to borrow money and
has already prompted them to raise base rates - to 10 per cent - in
mid-December.
During the autumn currency crisis the banks succumbed to government pressure
to hold base rates, even though overnight rates reached 20 per cent,
contributing to a FFr400m (Pounds 48.6m) increase in bank borrowing costs at
the time. But the French banks are already in difficulty, because of the
competitive state of the banking market and problems in the property sector
where prices have fallen in the past two years. They may not be able, or
willing, to swallow another rise in costs.
'The commercial banks could cope with higher money market rates for a short
period, but not for very long,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French
economist at Salomon Brothers. 'If the cost of bank borrowing stays at this
level, base rates will rise.'
High interest rates are already a drag on the French economy. The high cost
of credit has prompted companies to cut down on investment, thereby
depressing demand in the industrial sector. This has in turn contributed to
the continuing increase in unemployment, now running at an annualised rate
of over 10 per cent. Fears of joblessness have also taken a toll on consumer
confidence and, hence, on spending.
Another increase in base rates could aggravate these problems. The first
casualties would be France's smaller companies, which borrow directly from
commercial banks. Bigger businesses would be less badly affected, because
their debt is more broadly spread. However, another interest rate rise would
undoubtedly affect corporate confidence and set back the government's hopes
of a recovery in industrial investment. Such a scenario would further lock
the economy into its vicious cycle.
There are already rumblings of discontent from industry. A Louis Harris poll
published yesterday found that two thirds of industrialists prefer lower
interest rates to a continuation of the franc fort policy of protecting the
franc.
The French government has consistently ruled out the possibility of reducing
official interest rates until German rates come down. Moreover, as
yesterday's rate changes show, neither the government nor the central bank
shows any sign of wavering in their support for the franc.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Russian productivity falls 24%: Moscow acts to curb price
rises amid more grim economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S productivity showed a dramatic and accelerating decline over 1992
in line with a sharp fall in industrial output.
Productivity fell by 24 per cent over the year, according to figures
released yesterday by the independent Russian research centre
Macroecon-Link. This compares with a productivity drop of 8 per cent in
1991.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, yesterday reiterated his promise to
try to halt the country's industrial collapse. The government's main task
was 'to brake, and then halt, the fall in production', he said.
But the depth of Russia's industrial decline means he is unlikely to be able
to increase output as he promised on taking office in mid-December. The
already low productivity rate has worsened over the past year as output
plunged in nearly every sector - while relatively few workers have been laid
off.
Macroecon-Link estimates that in all main spheres of industrial and energy
production, except gas and electricity, production fell on average by 15-20
per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, and by around 25 per cent against 1990.
The Russian government also moved yesterday to curb price rises on basic
goods. The state price committee said company profits would be restricted to
between 10 and 25 per cent of sales value. Profits are currently restricted
to 25 per cent. Tass, the Russian news agency, said the decision expands
controls to include non-monopoly producers.
The decree affects companies producing bread, milk, meat and other
foodstuffs, but it did not mean the country was abandoning its move to a
market economy, said Mr Vladimir Safonov, deputy head of the price
committee.
In some sectors - such as fabrics and shoes - the decline in output over the
two years 1990-1992 was between a third and a half. According to
Macroecon-Link: 'Production fell most in branches which are directly
dependent on imports of raw materials and component parts (non-ferrous
metals, electronics, light industry, chemicals and petrochemicals), and in
the food industry due to the absence of effective demand and strict limits
on the use of raw materials.'
The figures underline the deepening economic crisis confronting Mr
Chernomyrdin's new cabinet. The premier is surrounded by ministers and
advisers who oppose his plans, and the depth of the falls in output and
productivity would render attempts to lift output very costly.
Nonetheless, senior staff appointments now being made confirm that the
reforming team of ministers put in place by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former
prime minister, is largely retained.
Mr Boris Feodorov, the new deputy premier for the economy and finance, is
seen as a potentially powerful figure in the control of credit and money
supply - areas where the Gaidar government compromised and allowed inflation
to rise to near hyper-inflationary levels.
In the last quarter of 1992, however, Mr Gaidar was able to bring credit and
budgetary spending under greater control - taking inflation down from 33 per
cent a month in November to 25 per cent in December.

The punt remained slightly above its floor levels against the Belgian franc
and D-Mark in thin trading in Ireland yesterday, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Money market interest rates eased from their high levels on Monday. The
one-month Dublin interbank rate fell to 19 per cent, having peaked at 43 per
cent on Monday. Dealers said the market remained short of cash especially in
one-month funds, mostly used by non-residents for speculative purposes.
'Interest rate protection of the punt has become an effective replacement of
exchange controls,' one added.
The central bank, in threatening to raise short-term interest rates from
their present overnight level of 14 per cent, has forced the banks to show
caution in lending large sums to non-residents.
Further turmoil is expected at the end of the week, if tomorrow's Bundesbank
meeting fails to cut German interest rates. Consensus is growing in Dublin
that commercial interest rates could be forced up again in the next two
weeks.
The government revealed yesterday it overran its exchequer borrowing target
of IPounds 590m by IPounds 123m in 1992. It is estimating a deficit of about
IPounds 900m assuming no policy changes.

Shortage of cash and soaring prices are causing problems for Russia's new
private farmers, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Tass quoted Mr Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the Association of
Russian Farmers, as saying that the government's failure to finalise laws on
land ownership and mortgage payments was also slowing the development of new
farms. 'The resources already allocated by the state to support individual
farmers are clearly insufficient,' Tass said. The agency said that there
were currently 173,000 private farmers in Russia, cultivating 7.3m hectares
of land.
The division of Russia's big collective farms into smaller units, or their
transformation into joint stock companies, is a key element in the reform of
agriculture.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S DECISION to raise its short-term interest rates yesterday provided
some relief for the French franc, which moved away from its floor of 3.4305
to the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
But foreign exchange dealers believed the Bank of France had only postponed
another speculative attack. 'We are still prepared to test the currency's
strength over the next few weeks,' said Mr David Cocker, chief economist at
Chemical Bank in London.
Some analysts continue to believe the franc can avoid a devaluation against
the D-Mark, an event that would effectively mean the end of the ERM.
Mr Brian Hilliard, chief economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull,
believes the franc is underpinned by the fundamental strength of the
economy, with French inflation now lower than Germany's.
He also noted that France's 5-10 days lending rate had been raised to 13 per
cent in the September crisis, higher than yesterday's overnight rate of 12
per cent. 'There is still plenty of ammunition in the Bank of France's
locker,' he said.
However, yesterday's rate rise failed to impress the senior currency dealer
at a large investment fund based in London. He said that he had already sold
in excess of FFr1bn into the market in the past week, and that he had no
French franc currency holdings left.
The fund manager said that France could not sustain high money market rates
for long because it would exacerbate the country's economic difficulties in
the run-up to parliamentary elections in March.
'The longer France keeps rates at these high levels, the more certain it is
the franc will be pushed out of the ERM,' he said.
Dealers continue to think the franc's future will be determined by decisions
made inside the Bundesbank rather than the Bank of France.

RELATIONS between Russia and Ukraine sharply deteriorated yesterday, as the
Ukrainians announced they would not continue with a deal concluded with
Russia in November on sharing debt repayments. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, also said he would not sign the charter of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, of which Russia is the keystone.
Mr Ihor Yukhnovsky, the first deputy prime minister of Ukraine, said in Kiev
that Ukraine would assume all of its own obligations to repay its debts and
'must receive its share of (former Soviet) assets'.
The declaration ends a provisional agreement between Russia and Ukraine for
Russia to take over Ukraine's share of the former Soviet debt - set at 16.37
per cent of an estimated debt of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 52.6bn).
Ukraine's move will alarm foreign governments and banks, struggling to
secure ex-Soviet debt repayments.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Emu holds key to freedom for central banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES by EC states towards giving independence over monetary policy and the
setting of interest rates to their respective central banks are to a large
extent governed by their enthusiasm for economic and monetary union (Emu).
Under the Maastricht treaty, stage two on the road to a single European
currency requires EC members to give monetary independence to their central
banks, prior to the establishment of an autonomous European Central Bank at
stage three.
Prior to the cross-party commitment in France to give monetary autonomy to
the Bank of France, Spain was the latest country to make a commitment to
give its central bank independence.
At the moment, interest rates are fixed by the Bank of Spain on receipt of
instructions from the Finance Ministry. However, the Spanish cabinet last
week approved a draft statute transferring control of monetary policy to the
Bank of Spain.
The Spanish government proposal uses the German Bundesbank as a model.
Within the EC, only the Bundesbank has its complete independence enshrined
in law.
Even in the Netherlands, whose central bank is widely regarded as
independent, the Ministry of Finance can issue guidance on interest rates to
the central bank.
Another country which has recently taken steps to increase the power of its
central bank is Italy. A year ago the Italian government took the decision
to give the central bank powers to set its discount rate, which is the rate
charged by the central bank in its dealings with commercial banks and serves
as a benchmark of other rates.
Meanwhile, Portugal in 1990 gave its central bank the right to collaborate
in the setting of monetary policy. Till then, the central bank had been
completely submissive to the government's wishes.
In a number of countries, the elected governments have little power to set
interest rates in practice, even if in theory the power rests with them.
These are the countries whose currencies shadow the D-Mark very closely
within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).
Thus in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, interest rates are in effect
determined by the Bundesbank, even though in both Belgium and Denmark
monetary powers rest explicitly with their respective finance ministries.
The one EC country which is now out of step, following France's move, is the
UK.
The 1946 Bank of England Act gives the UK Treasury the power to issue
interest rate directives to the bank. Though the Treasury has never issued a
formal directive, the government nonetheless sets UK interest rates, though
it consults the bank.
The Bank of England has traditionally exercised more or less influence over
UK monetary policy depending on the respective personalities of the bank
governor and the chancellor of the exchequer and the relationship between
the two.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor due to retire in June, has
lobbied vigorously, but in vain, for bank independence.
The Bank of England has, however, recently won a new power to criticise the
government if it believes it is not taking effective measures to combat
inflation.
Any move to give the Bank of England full independent monetary powers will
probably be deferred till after parliament has voted to ratify the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Germany plods on to interestrate cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank will soon be turning into the home straight and on the way to
the finishing line and the long-awaited prize of interest rate cuts. But the
track is uneven and littered with hurdles, and Germany's central bank can be
relied on to complete the course at its customary cautious pace rather than
dash for home.
The run-in, according to most German economists, will take up to three
months. It is now more a matter of 'when' than 'if', says UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, which expects rate reductions at the end of March at the earliest.
The bank's verbal intervention in support of the French franc yesterday, in
a joint declaration of solidarity with the Bank of France and the German and
French governments, successfully drove off the speculators.
There were some who found within its nine lines hints that the Bundesbank
was prepared to go as far as cutting rates to help protect the franc. But
according to Frankfurt stock exchange traders they were mostly foreigners,
chasing 'phantoms' and pushing the DAX index up 25 points to 1,556.42 as
they went.
The declaration was read in Germany as nothing more than an affirmation that
verbal and market support would continue.
Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said it was now up to
the Bundesbank to reduce rates, a move which would also help the domestic
economy. But the bank was in a dilemma: it could make cuts with a clear
conscience only when the government made a credible effort to reduce
Germany's steadily rising budget deficit, he said.
Interest rate policy will not be eased until Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivers
his solidarity package of pledges from government, opposition, employers and
unions on pay and public spending restraints. Talks are currently deadlocked
over Mr Kohl's insistence that social and welfare budgets must be squeezed.
Other substantial obstacles include inflation, stuck at almost 4 per cent.
While the Bundesbank wants to see the rate of price increases heading down
towards 2 per cent, it is expected to surge this month to above 4 per cent.
Rate-watchers believe the impending bout of pay negotiations with the public
service unions will provide a key indicator.
If negotiators can deliver a quick and modest settlement, the more hopes
will rise for the solidarity pact, for lower inflation and, in turn,
monetary easing from the Bundesbank.
Rapid money supply growth, another source of inflation according to the
Bundesbank, also stands in the way of rapid action on rates. But here
observers see some grounds for optimism. While recent rates of expansion in
the key M3 measure have been around 9 per cent and wildly out of line with
Bundesbank targets, economists calculate that growth rates could fall
sharply this month, even down to the 6.5 per cent upper target range set for
this year.
They argue that the economy is now slowing so dramatically that demand for
credit will collapse. In that case, and if the other hurdles are overcome,
the way will be clear for timely rate cuts. Timely not for France or other
EC neighbours, but for the German economy itself, which in March is expected
to complete its fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Liberty beckons for the Bank of France: Independent central
bank becomes a pre-election rallying cry for defenders of the franc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French political consensus for an independent central bank hardened
yesterday, when Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said such a move
would be desirable soon after the end-of-March parliamentary elections.
This confirms that the government sees eye-to-eye with the opposition, which
last month signalled that it would present plans to grant independence to
the Bank of France after the election, which is likely to be won by an
alliance of the opposition Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF.
'On this point, the opposition is on the same line as us,' Mr Sapin said on
radio. 'I would say that the French, by voting for the Maastricht treaty
last September, voted for the modification of the Bank of France's
statutes,' he said. This would not, however take place before the elections.
It is unclear exactly how much autonomy the French central bank would be
allowed, given that former treasury officials continue to dominate the top
financial jobs both in the private and public sector.
Yet any reduction in political influence over the French central bank would
add credibility to the policy of defending the link between the franc and
the D-Mark, supported by the leaders of the Socialist and right-wing
establishment alike.
This could also help to bring about closer co-operation between the Bank of
France and the Bundesbank, which is fiercely independent of any government,
whether German or French.
Less political influence on the central bank could reduce the impact on
foreign exchange markets of a vocal minority of mainly opposition
politicians calling for the franc to be floated. Rebel Gaullists such as Mr
Philippe Seguin argue that this would allow a fall in interest rates,
stimulate the sluggish economy and so help reduce the number of unemployed -
currently nearly 3m - and the main political problem for the present and
future governments.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, a centrist member of parliament tipped as a possible
finance minister in the new government, said yesterday that those who wanted
to float the franc were 'against the construction of Europe' and warned that
a drop in interest rates was neither necessary nor sufficient to bring an
economic recovery.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry and trade minister, added: 'Let us
ensure real independence for the Banque de France in March.' The battle
against the franc would 'end in ruin' for speculators, he said.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Corrigan to quit as president of New York Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD CORRIGAN, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York since 1985, yesterday said he would resign the post in August and
seek a job in the private sector.
Mr Corrigan, a one-time aide and protege of Mr Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in New York that he was not
looking for a job in the Clinton administration, although he acknowledged
having met Mr Clinton's transition team a number of times 'in the context of
brainstorming'.
He said a search committee had been formed to appoint a successor when his
resignation becomes effective on August 20. While Mr Corrigan said he would
sever all institutional ties with the New York Fed by next Aug-ust, he plans
to remain co-chairman of the recently formed Russian American Bankers Forum,
a Moscow project to help develop Russia's banking system, for the forseeable
future.
The search committee includes Ms Ellen Futter, chair of the New York Fed's
board of directors; Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT; Mr Thomas Labrecque,
chairman of Chase Manhattan and Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US Secretary of
State.
The resignation surprised the US banking industry, which had regarded the
51-year-old Mr Corrigan as a potential successor to Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve. But Mr Corrigan said he had never had any
interest in Mr Greenspan's job and insisted there was no 'hidden story'
behind his decision to resign his Dollars 250,000-a-year post.
The New York Fed supervises the New York banking system and is the Federal
Reserve Board's main point of contact with the US financial markets. Mr
Corrigan has been at the helm during several crises, including the 1987 Wall
Street crash. He has become the leading US spokesman on banking supervision
issues. He is also an important figure in international banking, having been
appointed last year as chairman of the Committee on Banking Supervision,
based at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.
Referring to his job overseeing New York financial institutions, he said
'broadly speaking (the financial system) is regaining some much-needed
muscle tone . . . I look forward to a stronger banking system'.
Mr Corrigan first joined the Fed in 1968 as an economist, and in 1979 was
brought to Washington as an aide to Mr Volcker.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night:
'Gerry Corrigan has been a close and valued colleague and is one of the
world's leading experts not only in monetary policy but also in
international supervision. His departure will be a great loss to the central
banking community.'

FT  06 JAN 93 / France and Germany pledge support for embattled franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL support for the embattled French franc strengthened yesterday when
the French and German governments and central banks issued a joint statement
repeating their determination to support the parity between their two
currencies.
Their communique went further than the previous joint announcement by the
Bundesbank and the Bank of France, during the last heavy attack on the franc
in September, saying they would 'pursue their close co-operation in order to
ensure the proper function of the European exchange rate mechanism'.
The French central bank also increased one of its two official lending rates
to try to drive up the cost of speculating against the franc while not
increasing the cost of business borrowing.
The franc finished yesterday at FFr3.4140, half a centime up on its Monday
night close and more than a centime above its ERM floor against the D-Mark,
and went on to close in New York at 3.41175. Neither the Bank of France nor
the Bundesbank openly intervened in the market.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said last night on
French television: 'Today we had no currency outflow at all. The market has
understood the determination of the authorities.' Devaluation was
'completely excluded', he added.
In Dublin, meanwhile, Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, gave his
strongest hint yet that the defence of the punt might be abandoned if there
was no overall realignment of the ERM in the coming weeks.
'I said I was prepared to hold the line until the end of the year. That has
now passed. If the system does not correct itself . . . the pressures on
industry are something that cannot be lived with indefinitely,' he said.
Pressure on the punt eased in the Irish Republic earlier yesterday after
high money market rates deterred speculation.
Several analysts took the statement from the French and German governments
as a sign the Bundesbank might consider a drop in interest rates in the next
few months if needed to restore order to the ERM. In their last joint
statement, the two central banks said only that they would work within ERM
rules.
In yesterday's announcement, they reiterated 'that the actual central rate
of the two currencies is fully justified on the basis of their economic
fundamentals'.
Separately, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, backed early
independence for the Bank of France, hardening the consensus with the
rightwing opposition for an autonomous central bank. The opposition,
expected to win the parliamentary election at the end of March, intends to
introduce plans shortly to grant independence to the bank.
The Franco-German declaration came with a 2 percentage point rise in the
rate at which the Bank of France lends short-term cash to commercial banks.
The central bank temporarily suspended its 5-10 day repurchase rate, which
was at 10 per cent, and replaced it with a 24-hour lending facility, at 12
per cent.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Sterling enjoys remarkable rally against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling enjoyed a remarkable rally against the D-Mark yesterday, rising by
more than 5 pfennigs as investor concern grew over the French franc. The
pound closed at DM2.51, up 5 1/4 pfennigs, a level it maintained in New
York. It was also strong against the dollar, finishing more than 4 cents
higher in London at Dollars 1.5455 and rising to Dollars 1.550 in New York.
There were suggestions that speculation against weaker currencies in the
ERM, including the French franc, had given the pound a temporary status as a
'safe haven'.
London shares, however, finished sharply lower. The FT-SE 100 index closed
27.9 points down at 2,833.6.

FT  06 JAN 93 / Oil spill threatens disaster: Stricken tanker in danger of
breaking up - Salvage tugs on scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON

<DATELINE>
   SUMBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEROCIOUS SEAS were last night threatening to break up the stricken oil
tanker which was yesterday driven ashore in the Shetland Islands, raising
fears of an environmental disaster.
According to Coast Guard officials, the Liberian-registered Braer, carrying
84,000 tonnes of light Norwegian crude, was holed at the bow and stern, and
Coast Guard officials were already talking of a 'catastrophe'.
Two salvage tugs had reached the tanker by midnight and a third was on its
way, although weather conditions prevented attempts to deal with the
pollution hazard, endangering one of Britain's most environmentally
sensitive shorelines.
Earlier, the Braer's superstructure had been visible from cliffs above
Garths Ness as waves battered its hull. Water in nearby Quenland Bay was
brown with oil. The fume-laden air smelt like paraffin and police ordered
people away because of the risk of explosion.
Shetland Island officials, assisted by marine pollution specialists from the
Department of Transport, were devising a plan to contain the spill. But they
said it was impossible to do anything in the mountainous seas and storm
force winds.
'The technology that's available is not going to do any good at all in
current weather conditions,' said Mr George Sutherland, the director of
maritime operations for Shetland Islands council.
The disaster, he said, was 'the worst scenario that we ever expected in
terms of ship size and weather conditions'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he wanted to be certain that
everything possible was being done to avert an environmental disaster.
Lord Caithness, shipping minister, said the engine failure could have
happened to any ship. Had it been at another point, the ship would have
missed the island. 'It is like hitting a needle in a haystack,' he said.
Giving an initial estimate of the cost of cleaning up the spill, Lloyd's
insurance officials said: 'We don't expect the damage to go much above
Pounds 80m.'
The fact that the crude oil is light in density should make it more likely
to disperse than heavier crudes.
Shetland Islands council has been acutely aware of the dangers of an oil
tanker disaster since the Sullom Voe oil and gas terminal was built at the
north end of the main island in the 1970s. It prepared plans to use booms to
contain oil spills and dispersants dropped from aircraft.
Mr Ken Lowe, the Coast Guard district controller, said: 'There is nothing we
can do tonight but we are setting up a joint response centre which will
decide what to do when the weather improves.'
There was no immediate prospect of the force 10 storm moderating or changing
direction away from the south-west.
The Braer had been making its way through the 22-mile wide channel between
Sumburgh Head and Fair Isle on a voyage from Mongstad in Norway to Quebec.
Yesterday, at about 5am, the vessel reported its engines had failed,
apparently because water from very heavy seas entered the fuel supply.
When it became clear that the tanker was likely to run ashore, the 34-strong
crew of Filipinos and Greeks was taken off by helicopter at about 9am.
An attempt was made to get a line on board the Braer from two tugs before it
hit the shore. A helicopter landed two crew members and Mr Jim Dickson, oil
pollution control officer with Shetland Islands council, on the ship.
But efforts were to no avail. Shortly afterwards, at about 11.20am, the ship
crashed on to the rocky sea bottom and the rescue party was evacuated.
The 18-year-old tanker has a single hull without the extra casing required
on new vessels since July last year.
Mr Lowe said the wind and wave direction was retaining much of the oil
leaking from the ship in the immediate bay where it had grounded. He held
out the hope that the wind direction would shift to north-west which might
drive the pollution away from Shetland.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons buys central London pub
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks company, was yesterday named as the
purchaser of the Old Thameside Inn, the central London pub sold for pounds
1.2m by Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group.
Harmony said the sale would significantly reduce its gearing. The decision
to dispose of the pub follows Harmony's qualified annual accounts for the
year to March 29 1992 in which Barclays, concerned at the group's borrowing,
insisted on a substantial loan repayment in January this year.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ramus warns of further losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ramus Holdings, the USM-traded building materials group, warned shareholders
to anticipate further losses in the current year.
In the annual report and accounts for the 12 months to June 30 1992, which
showed a pre-tax deficit of pounds 2.95m on turnover of pounds 52.9m, Mr
Lionel Ramus, the outgoing chairman, said that difficult trading conditions
had initiated structural changes to reduce costs.
These moves will result in an exceptional charge of approximately pounds
350,000 in the six months to end-December when losses before tax and the
exceptional are expected to total about pounds 1m.
Nevertheless, directors said benefits of the rationalisation and cost
reduction programme were already being felt. They expressed 'cautious
optimism' over the second six months.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Braddock prescribes some
healthcare for his future - The move to fast-growing Medco by the former
Citibank president is intriguing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET was taken by surprise last October when Mr Richard Braddock, the
president of Citicorp, America's largest bank, announced he was resigning.
But many are even more intrigued at the new job the 51-year-old Mr Braddock
has just landed - this time as chief executive of a small, but fast-growing,
healthcare company located in suburban New Jersey.
Conventional wisdom had it - and Mr Braddock admits he was prone to the same
view - that the Citicorp man would go into executive hibernation for several
months until he had found a suitably traditional and high profile corporate
post.
There was even speculation Mr Braddock might be asked to succeed Mr James
Robinson, who will be resigning as chief executive of American Express, the
rather battered financial services and travel group.
Instead of a conventional career move, Mr Braddock - who began his
pre-Citicorp career in consumer marketing at General Foods - will this month
become chief executive of Medco Containment Services, a company with 6,000
employees and Dollars 1.8bn of revenues in its last financial year.
Medco is a darling of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, although its share
price of about Dollars 38 is no bargain at nearly 40 times prospective 1993
earnings.
But the company is the leading mail service distributor in the US of
prescription drugs to employer and insurance company healthcare benefit
plans. It acts as a middle man, buying from drug manufacturers and offering
discounted prices to beneficiaries of company healthcare plans.
Mr Kenneth Abramowitz, a healthcare analyst at the New York research firm of
Sanford Bernstein, reckons Medco controls about 50 per cent of the Dollars
4bn-a-year US market in mail service prescriptions. He and other analysts
say the market is likely to enjoy annual growth of 25 to 30 per cent during
the 1990s.
'Medco is a very tough competitor and a very innovative company, so I would
expect them to hold the market share,' says Mr Abramowitz.
He is not the only analyst who has been heaping praise on the company. A
recent study by Merrill Lynch noted Medco held the key to success by
combining large pools of healthcare beneficiaries with economies of scale
and then relying on systems and software to get the most cost-effective
medicine to patients.
'We know of no other company presently that possesses all these attributes
for success,' said Merrill Lynch.
Medco at present has more than 1,200 institutional clients, ranging from
dozens of Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric to federal
employees; it is a pool of more than 32m people in the US. The company
earned Dollars 102m of net profits in the year to June 30, and analysts
expect it to make Dollars 130m on 39 per cent higher revenues of Dollars
2.5bn in the year to next June.
The need to reduce healthcare costs has been a big theme of President-elect
Bill Clinton and was also discussed last week by Mr Harold Poling, the Ford
chairman who complained that 'the rapidly rising costs of healthcare are a
concern not only to Ford, but to the entire nation.' Thus corporate
managements, insurers and government agencies all need to manage their
healthcare liabilities.
That is perhaps why Mr Braddock displays such a boyish enthusiasm for Medco,
saying the company has 'an awesome upside potential'. His bullishness is
doubtless helped along by a five-year contract which will pay him Dollars
750,000 a year, plus an attractive stock options package for 1.25m shares of
Medco and half a million more shares in two quoted Medco subsidiaries.
The job offer came to Mr Braddock the day after his Citicorp resignation was
announced. Mr Martin Wygod, who founded Medco eight years ago and serves as
its chairman, telephoned him immediately, having got to know the Citicorp
president as a private banking client of the bank.
Mr Wygod says he was motivated by the success Mr Braddock had in the 1980s
in managing high-growth businesses on the consumer side of Citicorp and by
his consumer marketing background.
'I was always interested in him. It's very hard to find somebody who can
deal with a substantial amount of change, who can turn a short-term
advantage into a long-term strategic advantage,' he says.
Mr Wygod, who is 52, has experience as an entrepreneur. Just before he
founded Medco in 1983 he had sold out Glassrock, another publicly-quoted
healthcare company he had started. The buyer, for a total of Dollars 125m,
was British Oxygen.
For his part, Mr Braddock says he wanted to get out of banking. 'I don't
consider myself a banker,' he explains, noting that his real desire was 'to
manage a rapidly-growing consumer business'.
As the new chief executive, Mr Braddock expects to develop Medco's retail
side, where the company has point-of-sale ties to 57,000 pharmacies across
the US.
Both he and Mr Wygod are also keen to make more acquisitions, such as last
month's takeover of American Biodyne, a California-based manager of cost
containment in mental healthcare with Dollars 130m of annual turnover.
'This company,' says Mr Braddock, 'can define its own upside. What we have
to do is make the right strategic choices and get the right people.'
Mr Braddock cites as possible growth options the widening of product lines
beyond prescriptions and mental healthcare to workmen's compensation, as
well as increasing market share by signing up more employee benefit schemes.
And he notes with relish that Medco has a unique database of patients, many
of whom have a plastic card that could be developed for other products.
While he is excited about his new career, Mr Braddock is distinctly
unsentimental about leaving Citicorp. 'It's history,' he says with a shrug.
He also notes ('to put things in context') that Medco's market
capitalisation of Dollars 5.9bn is not far from that of Citicorp, which is
about Dollars 7.8bn.
Medco's prospects as a go-go company in the 1990s are summed up by Mr
Abramowitz, who believes pharmaceutical cost-containment is still in its
early days. 'Drug costs in America are out of control and very few companies
know how to control them. Medco is one of the very few that can.'

spending in Spain

<TEXT>
FOREIGN motor companies, notably Renault and Suzuki, plan extensive capital
spending in Spain.
Renault, the French car manufacturer, is to invest Pta60bn (Dollars 526m) in
its Spanish subsidiary Fasa-Renault. Japan's Suzuki plans a Pta27bn
viability plan for Santana Motor, the loss-making four-wheel vehicle
producer it controls in Spain.
The planned investments coincide with a forecast of a 5 per cent drop in
Spanish vehicle sales this year after an estimated rise of 8.3 per cent to
961,000 sold units in 1992.
The forecast comes as all the main car manufacturers, except General Motors,
have introduced short working weeks to reduce stocks.
Anfac, the car manufacturer's association, estimates Spanish car exports
will be hard hit this year after growing by just 0.9 per cent between
January-October 1992.
Exports over the first 10 months of 1991 grew by 20 per cent.
The Fasa-Renault investment, to be spread over six years and incorporate
unspecified subsidies, is understood to involve the development of a new
high-powered diesel engine, likely to be built at its Valladolid plant.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ECC selling Haul-Waste to South West Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE latest move in its strategy to sell non-core businesses, English
China Clays, the world's largest producer of china clay, is selling
Haul-Waste, its waste disposal operations, to South West Water for a total
Pounds 27.5m.
The initial consideration is Pounds 25m cash, payable on completion,
expected in early February. Mr Peter Elliott, company secretary, said that
the payment of part or all of the balance would be triggered by the further
availability of landfill sites.
ECC announced in August that it intended to sell Haul-Waste, a waste
management company which operates landfill sites and collects and disposes
of dry and liquid wastes in the south-west of England. The August
announcement prompted a 24p rise in ECC's shares to 481p. Yesterday they
slipped 4p to 453p, while SWW's eased 2p to 487p.
The disposal programme will enable the group to concentrate on its core
industrial minerals and construction materials businesses.
Mr Ken Hill, SWW finance director, said that SWW was buying 18 of 20
Haul-Waste's sites, giving nearly 12m cu m of void space, and that there
were another 10 potential sites that ECC was excavating. He said the initial
Pounds 25m was being raised by a private placement.
Northumbrian Water Group has bought the Burnhills Quarry landfill site from
Tilcon. It will use the site for the disposal of hazardous and restricted
wastes.

<TEXT>
Paying Pounds 27.5m for holes in the ground may sound extravagant, but then
valuing waste disposal companies has always been a tricky business. Besides,
there is a little more than this to South West Water's purchase of
Haul-Waste, and the deal fits its strategy of concentrating on buying
related businesses in its own region. Nonetheless, this is another worrying
example of water companies using special pleading to justify high-priced
acquisitions.
At best this may be an expensive way for shareholders to employ some of
their excess capital currently tied up in the water companies. Fear of the
regulator constrains dividend growth, while management ambition and stock
market pressure to outperform encourage the companies to spend. Successful
diversification on a large scale could theoretically lift a water company
from a yield to an earnings valuation, substantially boosting the share
price, while the solid regulated core business means that the dividend can
barely be under threat.
Yet the history of diversification by acquisition is not auspicious. The
right strategy for companies seeking to outperform the sector may be to sit
on their hands. Finding a clever way to repay shareholders before the
regulators claw the money back might be even better. This is even more true
for the cash-generating regional electricity companies, which face the same
problem in spades.

BLOCKBUSTER, the US video rental chain which owns the Cityvision group in
the UK, yesterday said that Mr Joseph Baczko had resigned as president and
chief operating officer. Mr Baczko will be replaced as president by Mr
Steven Berrard, the company's vice-chairman.
The resignation of Mr Baczko - who had been with the company since January
1991 - was described as part of a reorganisation of Blockbuster that follows
a series of acquisitions.
Separate divisions have been created, including domestic home video,
international home video, domestic music retailing, international music
retailing and new technology ventures.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman, said the company's recent acquisition of music
store chains and its new joint-venture in music retailing with Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin group would lead to new opportunities.
He said Blockbuster and Mr Baczko agreed on the president's resignation plan
and added that Blockbuster would become an investor in a new retailing
venture planned by Mr Baczko.
Blockbuster's results for the third quarter of 1992 showed a 50.9 per cent
rise in after-tax earnings, to Dollars 41.3m.
Sales rose 24 per cent to Dollars 283.7m.

It may not surprise the cognoscenti of the art world to see Hugues Joffre,
the 34-year-old Frenchman who headed Sotheby's contemporary art department
in London, resurface as senior director of 20th century pictures at arch
rival Christie's. But such a switch at this level is highly unusual.
Both auction houses live in dread of experts, together with their clients
and contacts, being nabbed by the competition. Indeed, there is supposed to
be a gentlemanly 'no poaching' agreement.
A few years ago Sotheby's so dominated modern art that Christie's was
thinking of abandoning its London sales in this market. But now Christie's
is on a high, and claims to out-sell Sotheby's in post-1870 pictures. So the
arrival of Joffre has caused some turbulence. Tobias Mayer, at 29 one of the
firm's young high-flyers, has already jumped ship and can now be found
heading contemporary art at Sotheby's.
At this rate the world's two biggest auction houses could find themselves
juggling, like football clubs, with an expensive transfer market in top
players. Somehow one senses that they have too much to lose for this to
happen.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: WestLB raises Thomas Cook stake
to 86%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the acquisitive Dusseldorf-based public-sector
bank, has increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business from 10 per
cent to 86 per cent.
Despite investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting
influence over the booming German travel industry, WestLB said yesterday its
holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary was to be combined with other
travel and tourism interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik
Beteiligungs.
These include a 17 per cent stake in the Walter Kahn Verwaltungs group,
which in turn holds 30 per cent of the equity in TUI, Europe's biggest
travel agent. According to WestLB calculations, the bank's interest in Kahn
gives it a 5 per cent share in TUI.
The deal appears to mark the end of a complex process which started in June
last year when LTU, the charter flight and holidays company of which WestLB
owns 34 per cent, agreed to buy 90 per cent of Thomas Cook from the Midland
Bank. WestLB simultaneously took an option on the remainder of the stock.
The sale was concluded in September, when the purchasers paid Midland Pounds
200m plus an undisclosed proportion of Thomas Cook's 1992 profits.
As WestLB explained yesterday, LTU is left with 14 per cent in the once
British group.
Meanwhile, the bank, which has built a similarly complicated web of holdings
and cross-holdings in many industries, remains under close scrutiny by the
federal cartel authorities which are concerned over its growing power in the
travel business.
They are examining its interests in Horten, a retailing group, which has a
50 per cent share in another travel-oriented holding company, HS Touristik
Beteiligungs, with a further 25 per cent in TUI.
Although WestLB holds only 25 per cent of Horten directly, the cartel office
claims it has an indirect majority share.
The authorities recently won a temporary injunction banning Horten from
exercising its voting rights at TUI meetings. A full court hearing has been
scheduled for January 11.

FT  05 JAN 93 / UK buy-out deal with McDonnell Douglas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH-OWNED information technology company is to be created through a
buy-out of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems from the US aerospace
group. The deal is worth at least Pounds 200m, although the price is not
being disclosed.
McDonnell Douglas said yesterday it had agreed to sell the UK-based business
to investors led by Baring Capital Investors. The deal could be completed by
the end of this month.
Mr Jeremy Causley, MDIS chief executive, and the rest of the existing
British management team will stay with the company. Some 16 senior managers
will have a stake in the buy-out.
MDIS is one of the top 10 UK-based information technology groups. It sells
computer hardware and software for a range of industries and constructs and
manages integrated systems.
The company employs about 1,800 people, 1,300 of them in the UK. It is a
leading supplier to the National Health Service, central and local
government and the police.
Among its recent contracts was a deal worth Pounds 6m to supply St Mary's
Hospital, Paddington, London, with hardware, software and facilities
management.
McDonnell Douglas is selling the group as part of a strategy to concentrate
on its core aerospace business.
Only a handful of large corporations now maintain partial or total ownership
of information technology companies, once seen as a promising
diversification into a high growth sector. General Motors, for example,
retains ownership of Electronic Data Systems, one of the world's largest
computing services companies, which it bought from EDS's founder, Mr Ross
Perot.
McDonnell Douglas had been preparing MDIS for flotation on the London stock
exchange, but the offering had been postponed. The US company is understood
to have accepted it would get better value for MDIS through a private sale
rather than flotation, given present market conditions.
Last year, MDIS had revenues of about Pounds 180m although profits will not
be disclosed until the parent company publishes its results at the end of
this month. Some 30 per cent of MDIS sales are made outside the UK.
In 1991, MDIS made pre-tax profits in the UK of Pounds 14.2m on sales of
Pounds 139.8m. Mr Causley said profits in 1992 would be a substantial
advance.
Profitable British information technology companies, such as Istel and
Butler Cox, have changed hands in the past two years for up to 1 1/2 times
annual turnover.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aetna says storm claims will cut
earnings by Dollars 27m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, said
yesterday that the cost of claims from the winter storm that struck New York
city and parts of the eastern seaboard in early December would reduce
fourth-quarter after-tax earnings by about Dollars 27m, or 25 cents a share.
So far, Aetna says it has received about 14,000 claims, and it expects the
total to climb to about 18,000.
The December storm - named Winter Storm Beth - was the second major weather
catastrophe to affect US insurers last year.
Claims from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern Florida
last summer, helped inflate third-quarter catastrophe losses at Aetna's
property and casualty unit from Dollars 6m to Dollars 29m.
Aetna is expected to report fourth-quarter results on February 10.
In the fourth quarter last year, the company made a net profit of Dollars
93m.

FT  05 JAN 93 / Pounds 5.5m for Bristol warehouse project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED MOLASSES is to build a Pounds 5.5m warehouse at Bristol's Royal
Portbury Dock which it says will be the biggest in Europe for handling
animal feedstuffs and fertilisers.
The warehouse is part of a Pounds 15m investment by the dock company to
develop handling facilities for agricultural and related products.
United Molasses expects the warehouse to be operating by July. It will
initially handle soya and maize gluten and fertilisers.
Mr Tim Holderness-Roddam, deputy managing director of United, said: 'This
will be the biggest and most modern handling facility in Europe, capable of
discharging vessels of up to 120,000 tonnes deadweight.
'Much of the non-grain feed entering the UK has been trans-shipped from the
Continent. Our handling capability at Bristol will be potentially capable of
dealing with the major part of over 3m tonnes of Britain's annual
requirement of non-grain feed ingredients.'
United, part of the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, sees the investment as a key
part of its strategy to develop the dry bulk handling of by-products for the
animal-feed industry.
United and Royal Portbury have set up a joint company, Agricultural Bulk
Services (Bristol) to operate the development.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: BHP sells further stake in
Beswick

BROKEN Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced
a further reduction in its involvement in Beswick, a stockholding company
set up as part of its defence against a hostile takeover attempt by the late
Mr Robert Holmes a Court.
BHP said it had sold Beswick class A redeemable preference shares with a
face value of ADollars 300m (USDollars 206.8m) to the government-controlled
Commonwealth Bank, bringing the group a step closer to achieving its
intention of selling its holding of Beswick preference shares.
The deal follows the sale of class A preference shares with a face value of
ADollars 400m to Westpac Banking Corporation last year. It leaves BHP with
Beswick class A preference shares with a face value of ADollars 290m.
BHP said the sale was on similar terms to the Westpac deal. The group is
believed to have sold both tranches of shares at a premium to the face
value. BHP has said it hopes to dispose of its A class shares by the end of
May.
Beswick, which holds 322.6m BHP shares, equivalent to 20 per cent of the
company, was set up in 1988 to hold BHP shares obtained by Elders IXL, now
Foster's Brewing Group, during Mr Holmes a Court's takeover bid.
A second stockholding company, known as International Brewing Group, was set
up to hold shares in Elders acquired by BHP as part of a deal with Mr John
Elliott, then Elders' chairman and chief executive.
Foster's remains a shareholder in Beswick, together with ANZ trustees. In
addition to its A class shares, BHP retains ordinary shares valued at
ADollars 73m, and non-voting convertible preference shares valued at
ADollars 500m.
BHP shares rose 32 cents to ADollars 13.60 after the share sale was
announced on the Australian Stock Exchange.

FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: WestLB raises Thomas Cook stake
to 86%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the acquisitive Dusseldorf-based public-sector
bank, has increased its stake in the Thomas Cook travel business from 10 per
cent to 86 per cent.
Despite investigations by the Berlin cartel office into its mounting
influence over the booming German travel industry, WestLB said yesterday its
holding in the former Midland Bank subsidiary was to be combined with other
travel and tourism interests in a new wholly-owned subsidiary, TCT Touristik
Beteiligungs.
These include a 17 per cent stake in the Walter Kahn Verwaltungs group,
which in turn holds 30 per cent of the equity in TUI, Europe's biggest
travel agent. According to WestLB calculations, the bank's interest in Kahn
gives it a 5 per cent share in TUI.
The deal appears to mark the end of a complex process which started in June
last year when LTU, the charter flight and holidays company of which WestLB
owns 34 per cent, agreed to buy 90 per cent of Thomas Cook from the Midland
Bank. WestLB simultaneously took an option on the remainder of the stock.
The sale was concluded in September, when the purchasers paid Midland Pounds
200m plus an undisclosed proportion of Thomas Cook's 1992 profits.
As WestLB explained yesterday, LTU is left with 14 per cent in the once
British group.
Meanwhile, the bank, which has built a similarly complicated web of holdings
and cross-holdings in many industries, remains under close scrutiny by the
federal cartel authorities which are concerned over its growing power in the
travel business.
They are examining its interests in Horten, a retailing group, which has a
50 per cent share in another travel-oriented holding company, HS Touristik
Beteiligungs, with a further 25 per cent in TUI.
Although WestLB holds only 25 per cent of Horten directly, the cartel office
claims it has an indirect majority share.
The authorities recently won a temporary injunction banning Horten from
exercising its voting rights at TUI meetings. A full court hearing has been
scheduled for January 11.
