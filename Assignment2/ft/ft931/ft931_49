BID and deal activity in the US showed some modest signs of reviving during
the final quarter of 1992, although value of transactions for the year
declined from already-depressed 1991 levels.
According to Securities Data, the financial information company, there were
5,353 deals last year with a value of Dollars 123.9bn. This reflected a 10
per cent fall in value from Dollars 137.3m-worth of transactions during
1991. The number of deals increased slightly, having stood at 5,182 in 1991.
Activity rallied in the final three months of the year, when there were
1,377 deals with a value of Dollars 36.9bn - a 27 per cent improvement in
value terms over the third-quarter figure.

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Peoples Jewellers enters
bankruptcy protection

<TEXT>
BURDENED by debt and the worst retail conditions in 60 years, Peoples
Jewellers, a Canadian jewellery store chain, has entered bankruptcy
protection.
Peoples, 73 years old and operating 268 jewellery stores across the country,
was granted protection from creditors until March 31 by the Ontario Court.
It must work out a restructuring programme with creditors by that date.
Peoples' problems go back to the 1986 debt-financed acquisition of Zale
Corp, the largest US jewellery chain, in partnership with Switzerland's
Swarovski family for USDollars 650m. Zale operates under US Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
Peoples has written-off its Zale investment. Last week, Peoples missed a
CDollars 1.2m debenture interest payment. In the six months ended September
30, it lost CDollars 15.2m, or CDollars 1.24 a share.

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Several parties interested in
Savoy stake - Negotiations expected to resume this week for 4.3% holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVERS handling the sale of a 4.3 per cent share in the Savoy Hotel
group said yesterday that they had been approached by several interested
parties and expected to resume negotiations this week.
The sale of the shares, which belonged to the St Anselm Development Company,
has added further spice to the future ownership of the Savoy group. Just
over a month ago, the death of Sir Hugh Wontner, the group's president, sent
Savoy shares sharply higher as speculation that the bitter courtship by the
Forte group could be resumed. Sir Hugh had been vociferous in defence of a
Forte takeover.
Forte holds 69 per cent of Savoy's equity and 42.5 per cent of its voting
shares. Under a 1989 peace accord, Forte agreed not to purchase any more
shares until the end of 1994, and has repeatedly said it intends to stand by
the deal, despite Sir Hugh's death and the St Anselm receiver-ship.
A spokesman for Cork Gully, who were appointed receivers on Christmas Eve,
said: 'We can confirm that the stake is available at the right price and
that several parties have already expressed an interest.' At current market
prices, the share package would fetch around Pounds 11m.
Mr Giles Shepard, the Savoy's managing director, denied yesterday that he
had been approached by any of the prospective purchasers.
Weekend press speculation suggested contact had been made with the private
financiers David and Frederick Barclay.
But Mr Shepard said: 'The last time we spoke to them was 11 years ago when
they offered to sell us the Howard hotel.' He added that he would be
contacting the receivers this week to discuss the fate of the St Anselm
stake.
Sources close to the negotiations suggested that the National Westminster
Bank, which holds the shares as security against loans made to St Anselm,
may wish to sit on its stake in the hope of making money from any bid by
Forte after 1994.

FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Hammerson chief and managing
director to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMMERSON, Britain's third biggest property group, confirmed yesterday that
both its chairman and managing director are to retire in the next 18 months,
but denied this was a change in company policy, writes Christopher Price.
Mr Sydney Mason, 72, the Hammerson chairman, is thought likely to retire
this year after 44 years with the group. More surprising is the planned
retirement of Mr John Parry, 58, the managing director, who had been widely
tipped to succeed Mr Mason as chairman.
However, weekend press reports that the retirements had been demanded by
institutional investors as a result of the company's recent performance were
denied. 'It is normal for directors to retire at 60,' the spokesman said,
adding that Mr Mason's position was recognised as a unique one and that the
age factor did not count.
In October, the group announced plans to cut the final dividend from 17p to
6.5p. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 23.3m in the six
months to June 30.
However, market observers suggested that pressure had come from Hammerson's
largest investor, Standard Life, which holds 31 per cent of the ordinary
shares and 21 per cent of the lower-class 'A' shares. In 1989, Standard
helped Hammerson fight off a takeover from Rodamco, the Dutch property
group.
Sources close to the company have also hinted that pressure has been applied
from Hammerson's non-executive directors, equally unhappy at the group's
performance.
Hammerson's shares have mirrored the dramatic decline in property values in
the last three years. The ordinary shares, which 13 months ago stood at
660p, closed at 293p on New Year's Eve.

<TEXT>
EDS, the General Motors subsidiary which is one of the world's largest
computing services organisations, has strengthened its European presence
with the purchase of MBP Software and Systems, a Dortmund-based information
technology company. The price is not being disclosed.
MBP, said to be Germany's oldest computing services company, is a subsidiary
of the Hoesch chemicals group. In its last financial year it turned over

MBP specialises in systems integration in market sectors such as steel,
chemicals, manufacturing and energy as well as public authorities.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Economics: Policy questions dominate in Germany and the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD gets back to serious business today after a prolonged Christmas
and New Year break in most industrial countries. Policy questions will be at
the forefront in Germany and the UK.
The Bundesbank's central council gathers in Frankfurt on Thursday and is
expected to leave interest rates unchanged in spite of a rapid deterioration
in the main indicators of economic activity in Germany.
The annual wage round in Germany is entering a crucial stage with talks
starting between the government and the public sector trade unions on
Friday. With the Bundesbank determined to bear down on wage inflation, its
policy- making council has no incentive to ease monetary conditions this
week.
Also on Friday, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, starts to plan his
March budget with senior officials at a two-day house party in the Kent
countryside.
It is uncertain whether the Bundesbank and UK Treasury will be able
deliberate in peace. Tensions are expected to return to the European
exchange rate mechanism with the French franc, Irish punt and Danish krone
are likely to suffer speculative attack.
Attention in the US will focus on the December National Association of
Purchasing Managers' index today and labour market data on Friday to
determine whether recent signs of economic recovery are strongly based.
The main economic events and figures published this week follow. The market
consensus figures in brackets have been supplied by IBJ International of
London.
Today: US, December NAPM (56.5 per cent), November construction spending (up
0.5 per cent on month).
Tomorrow: UK, underlying official reserves in December (down Dollars 500m);
provisional December M0 (up 0.7 per cent on month, 3.4 per cent on year);
final November monetary statistics; BBA analysis of major banks' lending in
quarter to November. Canada, November industrial producer prices index (up
0.4 per cent on month); October leading indicator, employment earnings.
Wednesday: UK, October overseas travel and tourism; November advance energy
statistics. Canada, December foreign reserves.
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank council meets; December seasonally adjusted
unemployment (up 30,000). UK, November new vehicle registrations. US,
jobless claims week ending December 26.
Friday: UK, chancellor Norman Lamont starts two-day planning meeting on
March budget, with senior Treasury officials at Chevening in Kent, first
estimate November cyclical indicators, November housing starts and
completions; third quarter house renovations, December Halifax house price
index. US, December non-farm payrolls (up 120,000), December unemployment
rate (7.3 per cent), hourly earnings, average work week. Canada, December
unemployment (11.7 per cent). Germany, wage bargaining starts between
government and OTV public sector union.
During the week: GATT talks resume. Germany, November industrial production
(down 0.4 per cent on month), manufacturing output (down 0.5 per cent on
month), trade balance (unadjusted DM4.5bn surplus), current account
(unadjusted DM1.5bn deficit), manufacturing orders (down 0.5 per cent on
month). France November M3 (up 0.3 per cent on month). Italy, December

FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: Taking sights at prosperity - and for some
merely survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 12 months of setback and disappointment, most people in the
industrialised world will be hoping that 1993 will be a year of economic
recovery and prosperity after slowdown and recession in 1991 and 1992.
Many millions more outside that relatively small group of most favoured
nations will have their sights set lower - on mere survival and an end to
conflict.
The new year begins with some favourable aspects. With luck, the start of
the European single market and the inauguration of president Bill Clinton
later this month may boost business confidence in Europe and the US and so
help restore growth.
But the uncertainties are daunting and cover the globe. Many industrial
countries are still shackled by high real interest rates. Further tensions
are likely in the European exchange rate mechanism, threatening the EC's
ambitious plans for economic and monetary union. Germany, supposedly
Europe's economic powerhouse, has difficulty finding the right mix of budget
and wages policy to tame inflation. Japan is held back by debt deflation.
Constitutional problems beset Canada.
Little wonder, therefore, that late in 1992 the International Monetary Fund
revised down its forecast for industrial country growth this year to 2 per
cent from the 3 per cent forecast less than three months before. Such growth
will not stop further increases in unemployment.
Problems abound elsewhere. 1993 will see a continued struggle to bring
economic reform to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet
Union. But eastern Europe's experience since communism's collapse holds out
little hope that victory for reform will swiftly bring prosperity. Large
parts of Africa face further economic decline. It is unlikely that harrowing
pictures of famine will be banished from the television screens of the
developed world. Where prosperity beckons, as in China, political freedoms
often remain chained.
Yet there are glimmers of hope. A rush of upbeat statistics and confidence
indicators at the end of last year could signal a clear recovery phase for
the US economy after many false dawns. The UK, now freed of the need to hold
its interest rates at German levels, stands a good chance of escaping from
its longest recession since the second world war. But both countries will
need strong political leadership if they are to reduce their swollen budget
deficits and make recovery a prospect for the long term.
The world will still face difficulties adjusting to the end of the cold war:
both the industrialised democracies and the former communist powers have yet
to convert their military-industrial complexes to peaceful uses. But local
wars apart, the globe is becoming a safer place.
Nuclear disarmament continues apace. Elections will be frequent in 1993,
testifying to the strength of democracy and its growing importance in the
third world. If the IMF is to be believed, developing countries as a whole
will grow by a creditable 5.75 per cent, largely because some countries,
notably in Latin America, have adopted the free market policies and
principles that their industrialised competitors are spurning at their
peril.
But this year, like 1991 and 1992, will be one in which world leaders find
they are at the mercy of unpredictable developments. In so far as
foreseeable events affect their lives and ours, the important ones are
listed below.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Paper clogs the Euro engine -
Executive notes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HE IS fed up. As chairman of National Breakdown, a British roadside recovery
company, Ernest Smith does not doubt the wisdom of expanding on the
Continent. But he is sick of the paperwork - and executive time is money.
He calculated it would cost Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m over four years to build
a continental operation. With more than Pounds 2.5m already spent, he thinks
the figure will be nearer Pounds 7m.
So far his company's continental venture, Green Flag, has recruited 6,500
independent garages to provide repair and recovery services and his biggest
headache during the two weeks a month he spends at Green Flag's Strasbourg
headquarters is VAT.
'Suppose a German-owned truck breaks down in Italy, the Italian garage
charges VAT to us in France. The Italian authorities have said we can claim
it back - but they have also told us they will never pay. We, however, have
to charge VAT to the German truck owner, which he pays in France and
reclaims in Germany. But there are different VAT rates all over Europe and,
sometimes, several in the same country.
'It's an absolute bureaucratic nightmare and far worse than anything I
expected. It's taking up half my time.
'The only advantage I can see so far is that I can bring back 100 bottles of
wine every time I fly home to Leeds.'
SALMON RUN
ONE IS 29, Belgian, speaks several languages and moved to Shetland four
years ago. The other is French and has lived on the island for a year. Now,
from a telesales room overlooking Lerwick harbour, Marijke Stallaert and
Alix Cailleaux are helping to mastermind Scotland's penetration of the
continental market for salmon.
They work for Framgord, which markets about half the 10,000 tonnes of salmon
produced in Shetland each year and language skills make them vital to the
export operation.
They find buyers, agree prices and organise the transport of Shetland salmon
to wholesalers and smokeries in France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Italy and elsewhere. In France, for instance, the words saumon ecossais and
saumon fume ecossais are becoming common on restaurant menus.
FASHION FOLLOWING
'THE abolition of European border controls is a blessing,' says Achille
Maramotti, founder of Italy's Max Mara fashion group.
Lorry-loads of merchandise will no longer get stuck at national borders for
customs clearance.
Swift and reliable delivery is essential for a company which sells in more
than 40 countries, and operates in a sector where missed photo calls at
fashion shows can turn into missed contracts.
Nearly 40 per cent of its turnover goes abroad. Max Mara already produces
clothes in the same sizes for all EC countries and so is ready for
harmonised standards.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: The bell tolls for drugs harmony
 -Plus ca change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE midnight bells tolled on December 31, the pharmaceuticals industry
found little to celebrate in the creation of a European single market.
In few other industries has the promise of a single market been so poorly
rewarded. The important changes sought by the industry, such as a single
licensing authority or uniform prices throughout the EC, have not yet been
addressed.
Admittedly, by some legal quirk, a directive on pharmaceuticals patents came
into force, extending patents to compensate for the difficult and costly
regulatory hurdles facing medicines. But the measure will affect only a
handful of products each year. And since the extensions only come into force
at the end of the drugs' patent-lives, pharmaceuticals groups will only
start benefiting in the next century.
The EC has been forced, at least for the time being, to sacrifice its
ambitions for the harmonisation of drugs prices on the rock of subsidiarity.
At present, prices are set individually by national governments. Every
health ministry in the EC is desperate to control its spending on drugs.
Some - such as the UK - do so by allowing relatively high prices but
controlling volume, while others control costs by keeping prices low.
This means that in countries such as Portugal, France and Spain, prices are
often half those in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.
The result is that best-selling drugs, such as Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment
Zantac, are exported from the UK to Greece, for example, and can then be
imported back again.
Sir Leon Brittan, the out-going commissioner responsible for competition,
reckons this is a nonsense.
'With such disparate forms of pricing regulation, markets remain resolutely
national and consumers are not able to reap the benefits of a free market,'
he says.
However, last monthSir Leon admitted that plans to harmonise prices had had
to be shelved. Few countries were willing to let the EC decide how much
drugs should cost. If prices were set too high, health ministries could see
their drugs budgets spiralling out of control. If too low, others could see
their pharmaceuticals groups suffering.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Scotland and Swabia lead the
crusade to a new life - Continental venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL GRACE is not an ambitious linguist. He admits that when he wants to
order two beers in Catalonia - where he has a house - he finds the easiest
way is to say una birra twice.
Yet the deputy chief executive of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based
life assurance company, is leading one of the bolder drives into the
continental European market.
Last month it founded a joint venture with a large German insurance group.
It also has a foothold in the Italian savings market and is working on a
project in France.
Scottish companies have done well out of the life assurance and pensions
market in England, but few have developed further afield. For Scottish
Equitable the impetus to move on to the Continent came in 1988 when the
Department of Trade and Industry started advertising the single European
market.
'Our non-executive directors started urging us to take Europe seriously,'
says Mr Grace. 'They thought our policy holders would benefit from the
economies of scale we would be able to exploit.'
The company first commissioned an audit of its strengths and weaknesses from
Mrs Odile Pilley, a French academic at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
She found its staff to be strong in developing insurance products and in
fund management, but weak in foreign languages and cultural awareness of
other countries.
Yet Scottish Equitable has remained in no doubt of the opportunity offered
on the Continent, particularly once the EC's third life assurance directive
comes into force in July 1994. This should lead to deregulation and greater
competition in closely controlled markets such as Germany, Italy and France.
Governments there are finding their state pension operations increasingly
expensive, while German companies are worried about funding their pension
schemes.
Mrs Pilley drew up what Mr Grace calls 'a CV of the company'. This was
translated into the main continental languages, plus Dutch and Swedish, and
mailed to 200 insurance companies and financial institutions.
One of the respondents was Stuttgart-based Wurttembergische, one of
Germany's largest composite insurers with a big life assurance arm. It
wanted to gain British expertise in developing new products to supplement
the highly standardised endowment policies that predominate in Germany.
The relationship, which began in July 1990, was handled by Mr John Waterton,
a fluent German speaker. Aged 58, he joined Scottish Equitable after a
career in industry and, being married to an Italian, passed the cultural
awareness test.
He says the Germans were prepared to overlook Mr Grace's lack of fluency in
their tongue. Even with this disadvantage, the reassuring actuary had made
them feel 'he could help them adapt quickly to the deregulated environment'.
The German company soon decreed that all relevant executives learn English.
A further factor helped. According to Mr Grace, the Wurttembergische
executives are very conscious of being Swabians, the people who inhabit the
state of Baden-Wurttemberg of which Stuttgart is capital.
'Just as Scottish Equitable has expanded all over Britain from Scotland,
they have done the same in Germany from Swabia. Like the Scots, the Swabians
enjoy a reputation for canniness and thrift,' says Mr Grace who, like Mr
Waterton, is English.
The two companies announced the joint venture in October 1991 and launched
it last month under the name Allgemeine Rentenanstalt. The venture still
needs authorisation and will not start operating until the second half of
1993.
Although the single market should in theory mean that British-designed life
policies can be sold in Germany, this is not practicable because of
different tax structures. Instead, the venture will design products for the
German market which will be sold through Wurttembergische's sales network.
Its first target will be the personal pensions market.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: AC Milan channels its master's
loves - Football sans frontieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO Berlusconi is a media, supermarkets and property millionaire. He
also loves football. His ownership of Europe's dominant football club, AC
Milan, through his family holding company Fininvest, satisfies both needs.
Soccer is one television product that transcends Europe's national and
linguistic boundaries and Mr Berlusconi uses AC Milan to feed other
interests in his media empire.
The club has provided him with a lever which he has applied to win greater
audience shares for his Italian television stations. He successfully lobbied
UEFA, European football's governing body, to redesign the European Cup
tournament along lines which not only increase Milan's chances of winning,
but also maximise the number of matches - and hence income - for both the
club and the television stations.
The expansion of Mr Berlusconi's television empire into other European
countries makes more sense if he can find broadcasting material that
straddles these markets: soccer is perfect for that.
'I am not just a television financier. I create television - or at least I
try to,' he says.
Through Fininvest, which bought AC Milan in 1986, he has lavished a fortune
on the club. Since then it has won the Italian league championship four
times and the European Cup twice.
He transformed the debt-laden club with a huge injection of cash and astute
changes of coaching staff. He did not just want to win. He decreed that
'lovely football' should be played, a sentiment bound to endear him to fans
from the touchline to the armchair.
This year he introduced pay-television on his sports channel Tele-Plus 2.
Subscriptions cost Pounds 75 a month and the fare has included the Wimbledon
tennis tournament and the British Formula 1 Grand Prix. As Milan's owner, he
controls television rights to all their non-league matches. The European Cup
games are broadcast on his RTI network, some friendlies are on Canal Plus 2.
In the European Cup, the old knock-out contest has given way to a group
system for the last eight. Even if Milan does not reach the final, it will
have played 10 glamorous matches - and Mr Berlusconi's television station
had first refusal on all of them.
All this football puts a strain on players. To ensure that it has the best,
not only on the field but in reserve too, Milan has spent a fortune. In 1987
it paid a then world record Pounds 5.7m for Ruud Gullit. It rapidly added
two more Dutch stars, Marco Van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. These players led
Milan to the Italian championship in 1988 and the European Cup in 1989 and
1990.
Far from resting on its laurels, Milan has upped its spending. Estimates of
last summer's spree vary enormously. No one at Milan is likely to object to
exaggeration, especially if it shows Mr Berlusconi exhibiting more financial
machismo than his great rival Mr Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat boss and owner of
Juventus of Turin.
The sums talked about are between Pounds 9m and Pounds 13m for Gianluigi
Lentini - the higher figure would make him the world's costliest player;
between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 9m for Jean-Pierre Papin, the 1991 European
player of the year; at least Pounds 4.5m for the Croat Dejan Savicevic;
Pounds 5.5m for Stefano Eranio; Pounds 3m for Fernado De Napoli. Whatever
the real figures, they tot up to more than any other club in the world has
spent, outstripping not only Juventus but also the Spanish plutocrats
Barcelona.
Then there are the salaries. Traditional caginess reaches its zenith in
Italy, where accurate figures are especially not given to the tax man. Some
estimates put Lentini's signing-on bonus at about Pounds 2.5m and his
guaranteed salary at Pounds 7.5m over four years. He could add substantially
to that. Milan paid its players bonuses of Pounds 170,000 each for winning
the Italian championship. They will get more if they win the European Cup.
The club has substantial revenues. It plays in the 82,000 capacity San Siro
stadium which it shares with Inter Milan. It has 73,000 season ticket
holders who pay between Pounds 95 and Pounds 950. Tickets for individual
matches cost between Pounds 12 and Pounds 105 and average gates are between
78,000 and 80,000. It earns about Pounds 1.5m a year from its sponsors
Motta. Further income comes from perimeter advertising and kit suppliers, as
well as from television contracts.
In order to keep delivering success while playing more matches, Mr
Berlusconi has talked of having enough players for two teams: Milan I and
Milan II. 'We intend to play twice a week - some 80 to 90 matches in the
national league competitions, the European Cup, plus lucrative friendly
matches which will be beamed live on TV.'
His idea of keeping fans glued to their sets has a single-market flavour. 'I
look forward to a Europe where AC Milan supporters would be found in
Reykavik as well as St Petersburg. They would be able to watch their
favourite team's matches at the switch of a TV set, alongside the supporters
of, say, Marseilles, Real Madrid or Tottenham Hotspur.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AC Milan, seen in the stripes entering the San Siro stadium with opponents
Ancona, is an international team.  It has signed six foreigners - from the
Netherlands, France, Croatia and Serbia - even though it is allowed to field
only three in competitive fixtures.
According to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who controls the club: 'Restrictions
affecting the hiring of talent outside home nations are outdated and should
be dropped.  More should be done to organise Europe-wide tournaments in
which the best teams would compete against one another regularly.'
This would help Milan to exploit its far-flung fan club, which has 1,460
branches all over the world: six in Belgium, five in Australia and four each
in Russia and Venezuela.  The network extends to Iraq, Indonesia and the US.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Double vision mars clearway for
trailers - Two strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S two largest trailer and truck rental companies have a double vision
of the single market.
Central Trailer Rentco, a subsidiary of Tiphook, the British transport
group, has visions of a unitary Europe, where its trailers can be picked up
or dropped off in any country to suit customer needs.
TIP Europe, another British company, sees Europe as a collection of separate
markets which must be addressed individually.
The difference in outlook stems mainly from each company's customer base.
CTR serves a few large transport groups, such as Frans Maas, while TIP works
with smaller, local customers in 10 separate countries.
Despite their alternative strategies, both companies agree that the Single
European Act has removed some important barriers. Equally, they say problems
remain which could take years to solve.
'We will see steady progress,' says Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook.
'But I think it's going to take at least five years for us materially to see
the change.'
Trailer rental is most developed in the UK, where there is more of a
tendency for companies to contract out distribution and less inclination to
own trucks. About 15 per cent of trailers in the UK are owned by trailer
rental companies, compared with less than 10 per cent in Germany.
Road haulage permits, which were needed to cross some national boundaries,
were abolished on January 1. Vehicles no longer require customs
documentation for their loads, which in turn no longer need to be bonded.
This should save time and paperwork for trailers making cross border
journeys.
However, the benefits will only be fully felt if vehicles are making return
journeys to their place of origin.
Because of a number of structural problems, the free movement of vehicles
remains elusive. Once a border has been crossed, it will still be difficult,
or sometimes impossible, for vehicles to make onward journeys after
unloading. French hauliers, for instance, find it very hard to transport
goods between two points in Germany.
This restriction on hauliers operating in countries other than their own is
imposed by a system of cabotage permits. It is one of the reasons why
trailers are empty for about 30 per cent of journeys.
Cabotage is due to be phased out over the next five years, although some
observers say it will take longer. Even when it is abolished, other factors
will prevent the truly free movement of vehicles.
For example, vehicles have to be registered with national licensing
authorities, each of which imposes different requirements. Some countries,
such as Germany and Denmark, require a vehicle's brakes to be tested twice a
year. This means the trucks returning to their place of registration - often
at great cost - for the tests. Only two countries, Belgium and the
Netherlands, recognise each other's annual road worthiness tests.
Mr Grant Findlay, finance director of TIP, says the registration problem is
holding back cross-border rentals.
'If we have surplus fleet in the UK, it is very difficult to move them to
Germany, for example, if we have demand there. Because of these differences
between the countries, we still prefer to look at them as separate
territories.'
Price differentials also exist between markets. Germany's preference for
heavy loads to be carried by rail rather than road has led to average road
taxes for articulated lorries being almost twice levels in the UK.
UK rental rates are 30 per cent below continental rates, partly because of
competition and partly because UK fleets tend to be older.
These remaining barriers within the EC could take years to erase. In the US,
similar problems have only recently been ironed out - 10 years after
deregulation.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Hopes and fears - What the bosses
say ....
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A unified market of 344m people is now within reach of European business.
What are chief executives' main hopes and fears about this milestone in
European integration? What has been the impact of recent exchange rate
unrest? What government measures do business people favour to help stimulate
the European economy? Do companies still see the necessity for a single
European currency? Is the Maastricht treaty - the focus of so much
controversy in 1992 - still relevant? The FT asked 18 heads of European
companies, including offshoots of US and Japanese groups, to give their
views.
Sir Denys Henderson, ICI (chemicals, UK):
'The single market will create a larger, more dynamic, integrated and faster
growing market. We will use the opportunity to increase efficiency and lower
costs. The greater scale of operations will give European companies a
competitive advantage.
'Rapid Gatt agreement is the most important action to improve the business
climate. The EC also needs to agree lower interest rates.
'There is a strong practical link between the Maastricht treaty and
prospects for the single market. British companies risk being left behind if
there is a two-speed Europe.
'The goal of a single currency remains critical to Europe's competitiveness.
Recent exchange rate volatility has complicated trading, but I welcome the
current more realistic sterling rate, as the pound was clearly overvalued
when it entered the ERM.'
Sixto Jimenez, Viscofan (cellulose casings, Spain).
'Anything that opens borders and markets is good. Not having to suffer
customs checks and, one day, being able to enjoy a single currency and a
single banking system will make us stronger and more efficient. The richness
and cultural variety of Europe will keep markets diversified.
'If there is any common sense among Europeans, monetary union will prevail.
The political elite in Europe must show leadership. If not, short-term
niggardliness will block progress, and Europe will become a club of proud
'old glories', losing ground to the US, Japan and Asia.'
Pieter Bouw, KLM (airline, Netherlands):
'Airlines like KLM can now establish a genuine European market with the
whole of Europe as its home base. More competition will benefit the
customer.
'Although liberalisation offers great opportunities, we should not
underestimate the physical, financial and fiscal constraints. We must ensure
that national deregulation is not superseded by fresh Community regulations.
'The EC should set limits to state aid. It is not only contrary to the
treaty, but damages the whole idea of the free internal market.'
Peppino Fumagalli, Candy (white goods, Italy):
'The single market will boost technological innovation and allow more
efficient distribution. We have created a special company for after-sales
service, operating across Europe. Over half our top managers are
non-Italian. In 1992, Candy launched its first European advertising campaign
with an investment of L150bn.
'For the household appliances sector, the single market will spur management
integration and product standardisation. Appliances like clothes driers, now
mainly produced for export, will become more commonplace in Italy.
'We have to recognise that, for Italy to be competitive, it must meet
European standards for transport, communications, the civil service,
education, taxation, flexible work practices and research.'
Gerard van Schaik, Heineken (drinks, Netherlands):
'We aim eventually to pitch our main brands - Heineken, Amstel and Buckler -
at the market as a whole, rather than operating differently in different
countries.
'We believe the EMS will evolve into Emu, because over the long term this is
in the interest of national economies. The EC should fight the tendency for
regional or traditional products to be given protection within the
Community.'
Jack Schmuckli, Sony Europe, (electronics, Japan):
'Tax administrations are not ready for the 1993 initiative since the
temporary VAT system, which the Commission will enforce by 1997, will not be
able to cope with the changes within four years. This will cause great
inconvenience for global companies operating in Europe.
'The Maastricht treaty demonstrates the national authorities' willingness to
see Europe as a single entity - in line with Sony's business policy.'
Pierre Suard, Alcatel Alsthom (engineering, France):
'Because European markets remain heterogeneous, European companies are
subject to an extra R&amp;D and manufacturing charge of at least 10 per cent
compared with our main competitors in North America and Japan, which enjoy a
harmonised domestic market. Reducing this gap would be a major contribution.
'The most positive aspect of the Maastricht treaty was the prospect of
economic and monetary union (Emu). Otherwise, the treaty does not give the
Community the political power to carry out a balanced dialogue with those
two regions.
'The most important action the EC should take is to shift from idealism to
realism, for instance, by setting up an industrial strategy paralleling
those of the US and Japan.'
Daniel Janssen, Solvay (chemicals, Belgium):
'The single market coincides with recession, when Europe lacks
competitiveness vis-a-vis the US as a result of the high value of the
D-Mark. So we will see a lot of restructuring and closures. We will emerge
from all this with greater productivity and lower prices.
'Everyone talks about deregulation, but in environmental policy we see
regulation. It is absurd that France has decided to block the import of
waste. One man's waste is another man's raw material.
'For eastern Europe, the common market is their only hope. We must proceed
step by step to extend links with these countries. By 2005, the EC could
have 25 members. In the meantime, competition from eastern Europe is a
serious problem in both steel and chemicals.'
Jose Dedeurwaerder, Interbrew (drinks, Belgium):
'Anything which produces fewer barriers to business is welcome. There will
be an increasing tendency for business to concentrate and rationalise
activities.
'EC member governments must focus on producing currency stability, on
improving communication, and on closing the gap between themselves and
individual businesses and citizens.'
Sir Owen Green, BTR (industrial conglomerate, UK):
'The most important action for EC governments would be to achieve lower
interest rates in 1993. The EC should urge the German government and the
Bundesbank to agree and publish a common policy for their post-unification
economy.
'The Maastricht treaty does not appear very relevant to us - but then, we
are only businessmen. We do not think the EMS structure will 'evolve'.
Rather, it may 'revolve' - by going round in circles and not getting
anywhere.'
Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens (engineering, Germany):
'We anticipate a major milestone when new guidelines take effect in the
previously exempted sectors of transport, telecommunications and power
generation. This will improve our chance of winning orders in other EC
countries.
'Competitors from outside the Community will also play a major role.
Therefore, European companies should be given reciprocal access to important
non-EC markets.
'We welcome, in particular, that the Maastricht treaty does not support
direct industrial subsidies and measures that could distort competition.
'By hedging currency dealings, Siemens was able to avoid larger losses from
recent devaluations. Hedging costs, however, have reduced our earnings.'
Martin Kallen, Monsanto Europe (chemicals, US):
'We have already benefited by improving our cash management across member
states, and in logistics. We can now ship chemicals from Wales to Italy in
an enormously less complicated way.
'The Maastricht treaty brings no specific cost benefit for businesses,
therefore it has been less enthusiastically greeted. The Maastricht
timetable is, however, exaggeratedly ambitious compared with the pace of
economic convergence. We will get to Emu, but not this century.
'We see an undesirable shift in the European regulatory process towards
categorising new products as harmful unless they are proved risk-free,
regardless of their benefits. This inhibits progress. Already, for instance,
biotechnology research is growing several times faster in the US and Japan
than in Europe.'
Jacques Raiman, GSI (computer services, France):
We stand to benefit from any change in EC legislation which obliges our
clients to change their software and service requirements, such as on
payroll packages.
'The important thing for unregulated sectors like ours is that entrepreneurs
should be free to live and breathe. If there is one thing we fear from the
Europe of the future, it is the weight of national and European
bureaucracies.'
Loraine Krell, Replica Food (food displays, UK):
'The single market will allow us to offer the smaller foreign customer the
same service as we offer to the domestic market. It will be as simple for us
to send items to Milan as to Edinburgh. We will benefit from a reduced lead
time for our own purchases - allowing us to reduce stock levels and improve
cash flows.
'The most important step governments could take to improve the business
climate would be to conclude and implement a Gatt deal.'
Poul Svanholm, Carlsberg (drinks, Denmark):
'We believe the single market will lead to higher living standards, and so
benefit producers like ourselves.
'Currency instability is an irritant. The Danish krone's appreciation has
reduced our foreign earnings. In spite of Denmark's reservations about
Maastricht, I hope the EMS will eventually develop into Emu, and Denmark
will be a full member.'
Gerry Murphy, Greencore (food, Ireland):
'Since there is already free trade within the Common Agricultural Policy,
the single market will not have any immediate direct impact on our business.
However, the market is creating greater awareness of markets for products in
other member states.
'Financial transfers to the poorer states are essential to correct regional
imbalances.'
Fabiano Fabiani, Finmeccanica (engineering, Italy):
'We have been preparing for this new phase through rationalisation,
acquisitions and technological collaboration with other groups.
'Finmeccanica favours the broad lines of monetary union since this provides
a framework for currency stability. This is preferable to competitive
devaluations. It also forces the politicians and trades unions to overcome
the idea of easy deficit spending.'
Sir David Lees, GKN (engineering, UK):
'The single market will spur trade and competition. This will benefit
consumers, but place an increasing premium on companies being 'the best'.
'There will be still greater emphasis on investment in plant and equipment,
product development and training. Get this right, and the single market
offers much more opportunity than threat.
'The two actions which would best improve the business outlook are success
in the Gatt round and a cut in German interest rates.
'A return to currency stability, whether or not through the EMS, is highly
desirable. What matters is steady progress towards European economic
convergence.'

<TEXT>
Ready to invade: Massed ranks of cars at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.
The headache for European car producers like Peugeot is not January 1, but
the year 2000 when the EC is to end restrictions on Japanese car imports,
writes William Dawkins.
'Our real challenge is to get ready for the Japanese arrival,' says Mr
Tristan d'Albis, the former French diplomat who is external relations
director of Peugeot, Europe's third largest car producer.
Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, has won notoriety for his
denunciations of the EC's weakness in conceding to Japan without obtaining
equal market access in return.
Yet beneath the sound and fury, his company has been quietly improving its
productivity - by 50 per cent over the past five years - and renewing its
model line to face the Japanese onslaught which it expects in two years or
so.
January 1, however, did see the replacement of France's bilateral import
limit on Japanese cars, amounting to 3 per cent of the market, with an
annually negotiated EC-wide quota until 2000.
Mr d'Albis does not believe this will detonate an instant explosion in
Japanese car sales to Europe because Japanese manufacturers appear to be
restraining export volumes to protect margins during the recession.
In any any case, the old bilateral French-Japanese quota had become almost
redundant because it did not include sales from Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the UK, memorably condemned by Mr Calvet as a 'Japanese
aircraft carrier' off the coast of Europe.

FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Merger wave gets ready to break -
Deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW wave of corporate activity could be about to break as companies face
up to the competitive pressures of the single market.
The removal of trade barriers coincides with a trend for recession-hit
groups to define their core activities more rigorously. Companies looking to
make acquisitions may well find opportunities among the non-core divisions
put up for sale by debt-laden concerns.
The recessions spreading across Europe have helped to bring down the prices
of target companies to more affordable levels. Lower interest rates are
increasing the attraction of debt-financed deals, although banks have become
more selective in their lending.
This will lead to a greater emphasis being placed on the industrial logic of
an acquisition. To limit the cash outlay, deals may well take the form of
mergers or joint ventures.
Mr Mark Nicholls, a director at SG Warburg, says: 'The UK might be a
beneficiary if there were a new wave of buying by companies based in
countries with harder currencies.' The relatively low ratings of some
quality UK companies and the country's recovery prospects increases the
attraction.
The single market was already a force behind mergers and acquisitions in the
late 1980s.
Figures from the M&amp;A database of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm,
show that cross-border deals involving EC companies from 1988 to 1992 peaked
in 1989 at Dollars 53.5bn, before slipping to less than half that level in
1991. Preliminary figures for last year show activity recovering to Dollars
41bn.
Financial services saw the largest amount of money changing hands, with
deals adding up to Dollars 32bn over the five years.
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai's purchase of Midland Bank represented the largest
cross-border acquisition in this category. However, in this case, 1997 was
probably a more important date than 1992.
Food, drink and tobacco was the second busiest sector with deals worth
Dollars 28bn, while the electrical and electronics sector totted up Dollars
20bn.
However, 'you have to be careful about ascribing deals to one motivation,'
says Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell. 'There has
been a significant move towards cross-border expansion in Europe that would
have taken place irrespective of the single market.'
Nor will its advent cure all problems with mergers. Mr Douglas Brown, a
director at Baring Brothers, says: 'There is some opportunity for more M&amp;A
activity, but as an industry becomes more consolidated the opportunity for
competition problems to emerge increases.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Novell rallies ally for software
war - A look at preparations to challenge Microsoft's expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the US networking software company, is positioning itself for what
may become the computer software marketing battle of the decade, with its
planned acquisition of AT&amp;T's Unix Systems Laboratories.
Novell is on a collision course with Microsoft, reigning champion of the
software industry, in a fight to establish the dominant software system for
the next generation of networked computer systems.
Currently, Novell is the leading supplier of software that manages the
communications between computers linked on networks. Microsoft, however,
leads the market for personal computer operating systems.
The functions of operating systems and network management systems are,
however, beginning to overlap and the trend is expected to accelerate when
Microsoft next year launches 'Windows NT' a new version of its popular
personal computer operating system that incorporates network management
functions.
What is more, Microsoft has ambitions way beyond the desktop computer. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, has made no secret of
the fact that with Windows NT he aims to address a broader segment of the
computer market, including classes of computers that run the Unix operating
system.
Thus Novell's acquisition of Unix represents a move to counter Microsoft's
anticipated attack. By putting its marketing muscle behind Unix, Novell aims
to accelerate the adoption of the AT&amp;T developed operating system and
reinforce its role as an 'industry standard'.
Yet with the acquisition of USL, Novell will also inherit a history of
feuding over Unix which began in the mid-1980s with AT&amp;T's unpopular steps
toward 'commercialising' the operating system through a partnership with Sun
Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer.
Rival industry groups backed different versions of Unix, amid suspicions
AT&amp;T was favouring Sun over other computer makers.
These battles led to the formation of USL, in 1991, as an independent
business unit that would develop Unix technology while providing all
licensees with equal access to development plans. This was underscored by
the acquisition of minority stakes in USL by several computer and software
companies.
Novell's acquisition of USL will, however, once more place Unix under the
control of a single company, potentially resurrecting the old 'Unix wars'.
'Since AT&amp;T will no longer own USL, this eliminates some of the old
prejudices that have kept Unix in two camps and can help lead to the
unification of Unix,' said Mr Willem Roelandts, Hewlett-Packard
vice-president and general manager of the computer systems.
HP was a founding member of the Open Software Foundation, an industry group
that emerged in opposition to AT&amp;T's control over Unix. HP already has 'an
excellent relationship' with Novell, Mr Roelandts said. The same is true of
several other open systems computer manufactures.
Unix International, an industry organisation formed to back AT&amp;T's version
of Unix, was also quick to pronounce its approval of the Novell acquisition.
'As part of Novell, USL has pledged its commitment to fair and neutral
access to Unix technology,' said Mr Peter Cunningham, UI president and chief
executive.
The willingness of Unix supporters to adopt Novell as their new champion and
put aside the in-fighting that has characterised the open-systems movement
over the past few years represents a strong endorsement of Novell. It also,
however, suggests a closing of ranks in anticipation of the battle between
Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banesto deal is key step in sale
of Acerinox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sale of Acerinox, the Spanish integrated stainless steel producer, to a
multinational group has taken an important step forward with the sale of
24.9 per cent of its equity by Corporacion Banesto, the industrial holding
group, to its parent, the retail bank Banesto, for Pta22.8bn (Dollars 202m).
The bank, which is understood to be negotiating with several groups
interested in Acerinox, paid Pta9,500 per share to Corporacion Banesto
compared with the market price of Pta6,340. This puts a price tag in excess
of Pta100bn for Acerinox against a market value of between Pta60bn and
Pta70bn.
The deal between the conglomerate and its controlling shareholder was viewed
as window dressing for the industrial holding company's balance sheet, which
will realise capital gains of about Pta4.9bn from the deal, and as an
important step towards the sale of Acerinox, a company which for several
months has been cited as ripe for disposal.
Under new guidelines governing ownership by banking institutions of
industrial assets, Banesto, which consolidates its accounts with Corporacion
Banesto, has to reduce its stake in companies such as Acerinox. Analysts
believe that the change in the steel producer's equity from the industrial
holding to the parent bank smooths the path towards its sale in addition to
setting a notional price for the company.
Groups cited as expressing an interest in Acerinox include Ilva of Italy,
South Africa's Gencor and Anglo American, France's Usinor-Sacilor and
Nisshin Steel of Japan. Acerinox has a 33 per cent stake in a 110,000 tonnes
Mexican cold rolling mill controlled by Mexinox and shares ownership with
Armco of the US of North American Stainless with its 120,000 tonnes cold
rolling mill in Kentucky.
Acerinox's first half consolidated profits this year fell by 69 per cent to
Pta1.2bn.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Chirpy GMTV greets the nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A CONVENTIONAL breakfast show this isn't,' claimed the anchorman. At just
after 6am on New Year's Day not too many viewers were around to dispute this
proud boast for Good Morning Television, which yesterday took over the
breakfast franchise from TV-am.
On the first morning of ITV's Big Bang the GMTV formula for greeting the
nation appeared thoroughly conventional - cheerful, fast-paced, and
resolutely populist.
On Thursday, the last rather lugubrious morning for TV-am, one of the
sillier tributes paid was that the programme had stood for 'very visual
colour'. The set of GMTV is certainly highly visual - a sunburst-yellow
lounge with pink sofas and an Impressionist still-life.
The presenters are under 40 and as confident and chirpy as sparrows.
Predictably, the top news story of the morning was Princess Diana on the
Caribbean island of Nevis. GMTV had its own royal-watcher there who gushed
predictable twaddle. Items on Somalia and Slovakia came later.
Body culture looks like being an important ingredient in the morning recipe,
and not only features on health and exercise. A female fashion presenter
modelled stretchy black underwear in the studio and a female travel reporter
will do much of her work in a swimsuit.
Evidently GMTV has no aspirations to challenge its audience's intelligence.
The technology reporter ducked an explanation of how potatoes can contain
electricity by saying dismissively: 'Oh, it's all chemistry and that sort of
thing.' But it was a slick, confident debut.
Carlton Television's first contributions have been desperately banal.
Yesterday afternoon's Surprise Party, presented by Michael Parkinson, was a
reworking of This Is Your Life.
Richard Branson as the mystery personality was taken unctuously through his
glorious career.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAMLINGTON is marking the new year by launching four unit trusts. All are
initially aimed at the institutional market, but only one (the Exempt
Balanced fund) is exclusively so. The three other trusts - American Growth,
UK Growth and Emerging Markets - all have minimum investments of Pounds 500,
so are easily available to small investors.
The American Growth fund will invest in large and medium companies in the
US, Canada and Mexico, and will complement the group's existing American
Smaller Companies trust. The UK growth fund will invest in large and medium
sized UK stocks.
All the trusts, except Exempt Balanced, will have an initial charge of 5 per
cent; American Growth and Emerging Markets will have annual charges of 1.25
per cent and UK growth 1 per cent.
*****
Building Societies have noticed that nervous borrowers are opting for fixed
rate mortgages in higher numbers. However, the rates on offer are not as
good as they were two months ago. Chelsea building society is today
launching three fixed mortgages. One is fixed until June 30, 1995 at 7.95
per cent (for loans up to 90 per cent of valuation). The other two are fixed
until June 30, 1997.
For loans up to 60 per cent of valuation the rate is 8.50 per cent, and for
those up to 90 per cent of valuation, it is 8.75 per cent. Borrowers are
required to take out Chelsea's own house and contents insurance, and the
administration fee is Pounds 195. interest only and repayment mortgages, as
well as pension and endowment deals, are available.
*****
Britannia building society has launched an 8.75 per cent mortgage fixed for
five years. The arrangement fee is Pounds 225, and early redemption attracts
a penalty of 180 days' interest. Interest only and repayment mortgages are
available but you are required to buy Britannia's own house and contents
insurance.
*****
Societies are also waking up to the outflow of savers' funds into other
products following the autumn base rate cuts. National &amp; Provincial is
offering a one percentage point of extra interest for a month on its Instant
Reserve, Private Reserve and Investment Reserve accounts. Money must stay in
the accounts until the end of February, when the extra interest will be paid
for 31 days, based on the balance growth during January.
*****
Life Association of Scotland is one of the many companies trying to tempt
funds away from the building societies. It is promoting its 'Generator'
plan, a five-year temporary annuity linked to a personal equity plan. The
scheme is very similar to Scottish Widow's plan, marketing for which has
been sharply criticised by some advisers.
Part of the investment goes into the annuity, which pays out an income,
while the Pep aims to grow enough to restore the capital at the end of the
five years.
It needs to grow by at least 13 per cent per annum if the capital is to be
replaced in full, so investors have a real chance of capital loss.
LAS is hoping to attract funds from building societies, but admits that the
exposure to equities means a higher level of risk. If capital is returned,
then income should total above 9 per cent annually, depending on the age and
sex of the annuitant.
*****
Falling interest rates do seem to mean some relief for those whose debts
were out of control. TSB has cuts the monthly interest rate on TSB Trustcard
and TSB MasterCard from 1.89 per cent to 1.79 per cent, with effect from
January 25.
The APR for purchases will be 23.7 per cent, and 24.1 per cent for cash
advances.
TSB still does not charge an annual fee for its credit cards, unlike any of
the big four clearers, and claims the latest move makes its credit cards
'among the most competitively priced available'.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Single market brings air fare cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAPER AIR fares arrived in the single European market right on schedule
yesterday as Lufthansa, the German state carrier, began selling cut price
return tickets between every European Community member state and a dozen
German cities.
Passengers can now, for a limited period, fly from the UK to Germany for
Pounds 99 return and from France for FFr999 return. The lowest scheduled
fare between the UK and Germany was previously about Pounds 125.
Lufthansa's move has already prompted three other airlines - Air France, KLM
of the Netherlands, and Copenhagen-based Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) -
to match the cuts, although only on economy flights to Germany. British
Airways says it has no plans to follow suit.
The cuts have been made possible by the Third Airline Liberalisation
package, agreed last summer by EC members. Under the rules, fares can be
changed without consulting governments first. Only if governments at both
ends of the route disapprove of a new fare must it be withdrawn.
The Lufthansa cut-price offer applies to economy tickets sold before January
15 and is valid for flights until March 31.
This could be followed by further offers by carriers as they adapt to the
newly-liberalised market.
Lufthansa prepared its pan-EC marketing assault amid strict secrecy. By its
own admission it is more associated with business class customers and high
ticket prices and wanted to maximise the element of surprise.
The venture is already a success, it claims. In the first two days of
promotion, Lufthansa's London offices received double the number of
telephone inquiries than normal for the time of year.
Technology has also come to the aid of the airline.
'We have electronic filing systems to computer reservations networks. We can
announce a price cut today and be selling the tickets tomorrow,' said Mr
Frank Zehle, Lufthansa's marketing manager for Great Britain and Ireland.
It is not yet clear whether European fares can fall as far as they did in
the US after deregulation in the 1970s. Landing fees, air traffic control
charges and wages are often higher in Europe.
On the other hand, many European carriers are state-owned and may be able to
sustain losses longer than privately-owned companies.
The combined losses of European airlines last year were Dollars 1.3bn.
Airline traffic has yet to show a sustained recovery following the slump
caused by the Gulf crisis and the recession.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Besnier's 8% stake in Bel fuels
takeover speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESNIER, the acquisitive French cheese group, has been building a stake in
Bel, the maker of one of France's best known soft cheeses, fuelling
speculation that it might eventually try to take control of the company.
The French cheese industry is in the throes of restructuring chiefly due to
the expansion of Besnier, a family firm led by Mr Michel Besnier which
recently bought les Caves de Roquefort after the Perrier takeover saga, and
Bongrain, its chief competitor.
These companies have been steadily increasing their interests by buying up
the smaller cheese makers that are finding it increasingly difficult to
compete in the European market, now dominated by multinational groups,
notably Nestle and the hypermarket groups.
Besnier, which now makes annualised sales of FFr22bn (Dollars 4bn),
disclosed this week that it has bought 8.1 per cent of Bel including 5 per
cent of the voting stock. Bel is a publicly quoted company but controlled by
the Fievet family. However Mr Robert Fievet, chairman, is 84. Rumours of his
retirement have fuelled speculation about the future ownership of Bel.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Motoring: Bargains beckon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL and EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-Channel ferry operators, notably Stena Sealink, are already carrying
extra travellers eager to buy cheap drink in France, writes Stuart Marshall.
From yesterday, weight and space are the only practical limits on what a
motorist can bring back, local duty paid, from France.
No longer will you have to trouble your conscience by tucking an illicit
extra bottle under the seat. Customs' guidelines allow for 90 litres of
wine, 10 litres of spirits, and 110 litres of beer. All you need do is
convince them you are going to drink it all yourself.
Even duty-free allowances are to be doubled - you can bring in what you buy
on both outward and return voyages. The pity is that with Ffr8 to the pound,
not Ffr10, hypermarket wines are not the bargains they were. But lager
(under Pounds 5 for two dozen 25cl bottles) is still cheap.
Stena Sealink, which offers day trip fares starting from Pounds 70 return
for a car with five people, is featuring the Champagne-Ardennes region in
its 1993 short break programme. Two nights' bed and breakfast in Reims will
be about Pounds 80 a person in a two-star hotel and Pounds 120 for a
four-star relais du silence, ferry crossings included.
For a small supplement, visits to champagne cellars, with a tasting, are
included. Reims is a relaxed 2 1/2 -hour (and Ffr170) drive on the uncrowded
A26 autoroute starting in Calais docks.
Edmund Penning-Rowsell writes: In Alice King's book A Bootful of Wine
(Mandarin/Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 4.99, 192 pages) the wine-buying
operation is planned in detail. Be sure to work out the car's payload and
capacity, and how to pack the wine. A VW Golf hatchback with the back seat
down takes 20 cases, a Ford Sierra 10 in the boot.
King lists and describes 230 wines likely to be found in French supermarkets
and provides recommended growers' names to be found on the label.
Biggest savings are on sparkling wines: Pounds 1.83 a bottle on duty and
VAT, compared with Pounds 1.11 table wines. Each wine listed is given the
grape variety, its phonetic spelling and price band: inexpensive below
Ffr20, medium-priced Ffr20-70 and expensive more than Ffr70. Buyers at
cellars in wine districts must ensure that the green capsule conge is on the
bottle top, as this alone shows that TVA (VAT) has been paid.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Operatic melodrama: After the traumas of 1992, the new Paris
opera house faces a critical year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the curtains swung to a close at the end of Messiaen's St Francis of
Assisi at the Opera Bastille in Paris on Tuesday, it marked the end of a
traumatic year at France's lavish new opera house.
The trouble started this summer when a set collapsed during a touring
production of Otello in Seville, killing one singer and injuring 36 others.
The tragedy aggravated the tension among the Bastille management. Mr
Philippe Belaval resigned as chief executive in August, together with six
senior colleagues. Then there was a furore over the new contract of his
former foe, Mr Myung-Whun Chung, now one of the highest-paid artistic
directors in international opera.
The new management is beginning a critical year: it must heal the scars of
Seville and establish the Bastille as a centre of excellence in
international opera. It may also confront a less sympathetic political
climate if, as the opinion polls suggest, the ruling Socialists, who founded
the Opera Bastille, lose the March general elections and the right returns
to power.
The litany of trials and tribulations is very different from the picture
painted by President Francois Mitterrand in 1982 when he unfurled his plans
for a new 'people's opera'. Paris opera was in the doldrums. The old Opera
Garnier was run down. The president envisaged a brand new opera house with
cheap seats, state-of-the-art acoustics and magnificent music.
The government spent almost FFr3bn (Pounds 365m) to build the 2,700-seat
house at place de la Bastille. It is run as part of the Opera de Paris
together with the Garnier, now used for dance, and the smaller Opera
Comique. It has an annual budget of FFr800m, of which the state provides 65
per cent. President Mitterrand in 1988 appointed Mr Pierre Berge, one of his
staunchest supporters and dubbed Pierre le Panthere for his ruthless style
in running the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, as chairman of Opera de
Paris.
But the melodrama began even before the Bastille's opening. A string of
resignations culminated in early 1989 with that of Mr Daniel Barenboim, the
conductor, who stormed out as artistic director after a row with Mr Berge.
Mr Chung, then a comparatively obscure Korean conductor, succeeded him. The
Opera Bastille opened its first full opera, Les Troyens by Berlioz, in March
1990 to mixed reviews.
The reviews have remained mixed ever since. The Bastille is almost always
full, with an audience of 392,290 last year. It has also had some success in
fulfilling its populist mandate. Almost a third of its audience are
first-time opera goers. But it has been haunted by complaints about the
building, a lacklustre response from the critics and more management
problems.
'I'm French and I'm an opera buff, I want it to work,' said Mr Alain
Lompech, opera critic of the daily newspaper, Le Monde. 'But there has only
been one production good enough to launch Paris opera on the international
arena - Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth, directed by Chung.'
One obstacle is the glacial, modernist building, designed by Carlos Ott,
which has been criticised on architectural and musical grounds. 'It was a
wonderful idea to build a new opera house, but the acoustics are not great
and the theatre is a disaster,' said Mr Max Loppert, the FT's opera critic.
'The scale of the stage makes it difficult to put on anything other than the
very biggest operas.'
The Bastille is now mooting plans for a Petite Salle with 1,100 seats for
smaller productions. However, its hopes of securing the state's financial
support could be scuppered if the Conservatives win the March elections.
Last time the right was in power, in the mid-1980s, it tried to scrap the
Bastille project by calling a halt to the building work. A future
Conservative government might be less generous to the new opera house than
the sympathetic Socialists.
Meanwhile, there is little the Bastille can do about its labyrinthine
lay-out. 'It's impossible to find your way around,' said Mr Lompech. 'I've
been there dozens of times but I'm still so confused that, whenever I leave
my seat, I can't find my way back.'
The Bastille has also been hounded by the strikes and stoppages that dogged
the Garnier. The French government baulked at adding a battle with the opera
unions to its other difficulties before the opening, so the new house
retains the old union agreements, which have lumbered it with a high wage
bill and rigid working practices. The 'people's opera' is also burdened by
high prices: tickets range from FFr50 to FFr560, but two-thirds cost more
than FFr200.
Mr Belaval spent his 20 months as chief executive in intricate negotiations,
trying to thrash out a new union agreement. But this summer Mr Berge
intervened, and bowed to union pressure by extending the deadline for the
negotiations from August to November. Mr Belaval, already fuming after rows
with Mr Chung over who was to blame for the Seville disaster, resigned. The
November deadline has passed, but the negotiations are still going on.
The union problems, combined with frequent management changes - Mr Belaval
was the fourth chief executive to resign in as many years - have made it
difficult for the Bastille to fulfil its creative potential. Mr Loppert's
view is that it has 'not lived up to expectations'. Even Mr Chung admitted
to Le Monde this autumn that he was unhappy with the quality of output and
that, in three years, he had only been satisfied with one production, Lady
Macbeth.
The Bastille desperately needs a period of stability to recover from the
trauma of the Seville tour. So far only half the injured singers have
returned to work. Mr Chung must then get to grips with its music, while the
management, under Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the new chief executive, tackles the
unions.
There are some positive signs. Mr Chung's new contract not only increases
his financial package - which will rise from FFr3.3m next year to FFr8m at
the end of his six-year term - but also considerably extends his power.
'Until now he hasn't really had the chance to be anything other than a good
conductor,' said one critic. He now has complete control over programming
and artistic policy, and will be consulted on some administrative issues.
Mr Cluzel, meanwhile, is a high-flying bureaucrat, who has headed the
Socialists' arts administration reforms but who also has the advantage of
close contacts with the right, having worked for a Conservative minister in
the mid-1980s. His ability to straddle both sides of the French political
arena could prove invaluable to the opera house after the elections.
But if there is a change of government this spring, it seems doubtful that
even Mr Cluzel will be able to prevent the Opera Bastille from being
embroiled in a repetition of the mid-1980s power struggle between President
Mitterrand and the Conservatives, particularly as Mr Berge is so close to
the president. The Opera Bastille seems set for another melodramatic year.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Kenyan opposition parties reject election results

KENYA's political crisis deepened last night as the three main opposition
parties rejected election results and alleged 'massive rigging'. President
Daniel arap Moi said they were pushing the country towards civil war.
The move by the united opposition, pledging to prevent Mr Moi from
exercising power and dem-anding fresh elections, immediately raised the
prospect of conflict in the country. Provisional results last night showed
the 68-year-old president and his ruling party Kanu had won the presidential
and parliamentary polls.
President Moi told reporters at State House that he denied the allegations
and said the opposition leaders were 'liars' pushing Kenya towards civil
war.
In what was taken as an imminent crackdown, Mr Moi said he had tolerated
much abuse from the opposition. 'This will now cease,' he said. He appealed
to western governments to recognise his victory and resume aid suspended
last year pending pol-itical pluralism and economic re-form. 'Kenya has
taken a giant step forward, not without great risk and potential pitfalls,'
he said. 'I call on the world . . . to recognise our achievement.'
The opposition demands coincided with a statement by the Commonwealth group
of observers, further undermining Mr Moi's credibility. 'It was evident to
us from the start that some aspects of the election were not fair,' the
group said. It qualified its criticism, saying the election 'constitutes a
giant step on the road to multi-party democracy'. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the
secretary-general of the Commonwealth, was last night poised to break off a
holiday in Gambia for a crisis mission to Kenya.
A joint statement by Mr Ken-neth Matiba, of Ford-Asili, Mr Mwai Kibaki, of
the Democratic party and Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga of Ford-Kenya, the three
opposition leaders, accused Mr Moi and Kanu of 'hijacking democracy' and
bringing the country to the brink of a crisis.
Among the electoral abuses they alleged against Kanu were widespread
intimidation, massive fraud in counting and tallying votes, introduction of
illegal ballot boxes stuffed with Kanu votes and the counting of opposition
votes for Kanu candidates.
It was clear that the opposition coalition was trying to hold back a
possible eruption of violence. However, although the parties refused to
spell out their strategy, they were threatening to mobilise massive protest
if their demands were not met.
'If we had not acted, the people of Kenya would already be in the streets,'
said Mr Matiba.
Results from 167 of the 188 constituencies announced by last night showed
that Mr Moi had won the presidential race with 1,796,233 votes. Mr Matiba,
with 1,228,870 votes, was in second place ahead of Mr Odinga and Mr Kibaki.
In the parliamentary poll, out of 156 results declared Kanu had won 85 seats
to the opposition's 71, lead by Ford-Asili and Ford-Kenya with 25 MPs each.
Kanu must win 89 seats to give it a working majority.
Opposition officials pointed out that, even in what they said was a rigged
poll, Mr Moi had only won 36 per cent of the presidential poll. In the
parliamentary election, 15 of his cabinet ministers were defeated, including
two of his most important 'political barons', Mr Elijah Mwangale, former
agriculture minister, and Mr Joseph Kamotho, the Kanu secretary.
Mr Moi and Kanu had also been trounced in the heartland of Kenya's two
biggest tribes, the Kikuyu and the Luo.

<TEXT>
THE International Committee of the Red Cross said yesterday it was trying to
arrange for 10 Palestinians, wrongly expelled into Lebanese territory by
Israel more than two weeks ago, to return home tomorrow, Reuter reports from
Lebanon.
The move came as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to let all 415
deported Palestinians return early if the Palestinian intifada or uprising
in the occupied territories was halted. But his offer was rejected by
Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi as 'a non-starter'.
Israel has conceded it deported ten of the men by mistake, though nine of
them face jail if they go along with moves to repatriate them.
All the deportees were still stranded in an icy tent camp in a no-man's
land, blocked by Lebanese soldiers on one side and Israeli troops on the
other.
Israel expelled the Palestinians for periods of up to two years after a wave
of killings blamed on a Moslem fundamentalist group opposed to the Middle
East peace talks.
Rejecting the idea of halting the intifada, Mrs Ashrawi said: 'All along the
Palestinian position has been that the intifada is not a bargaining chip.
The intifada will remain as long as the occupation remains.'
Mr Rabin himself discounted the possibility of the intifada being halted,
saying: 'I know this is almost a pipe dream.'

The blaze was in a prefabricated wooden building, part of a complex where up
to 95 asylum-seekers have lived temporarily.
Yesterday saw another huge German demonstration against racism, when an
estimated 300,000 people turned out on a freezing evening in the city of
Essen, in the industrial Ruhr region, to form a 'chain of light', with
lanterns and candles, to condemn right-wing violence. Similar demonstrations
of up to 500,000 people at a time have been held in other cities.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Private View: The man who broke the Bank of England - George
Soros is a speculator. He bet heavily against the ERM and won dollars 2bn.
Now he is giving the money away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A man makes so much money that he can afford to give away Dollars 250m
it is no surprise to learn he has a theory about life.
George Soros, the Hungarian fund manager who broke the Bank of England in
September and gave the Bosnian Muslims a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.8m)
Christmas present, is rather different. Not only is he one of the most
successful financial speculators in history but in his case the theory came
before, not after, the moneymaking.
Soros is a frustrated intellectual who once fancied himself a new Keynes or
Einstein. As a youth in Nazi - and then Communist - Budapest, he was plagued
by the philosophical problem of the subjectivity of human perceptions. He
tried, and failed, to resolve the problem in a treatise called 'The Burden
of Consciousness'.
Even before arriving in England at the age of 17 to study under him at the
London School of Economics, Soros had felt the influence of Sir Karl Popper,
the Viennese philosopher of science whose Open Society and its Enemies
denounced Plato, Hegel, Marx and all historical determinism.
After an undistinguished merchant banking apprenticeship in the City and
Wall Street, Soros found himself in charge of an investment portfolio and
began to apply his ideas on human subjectivity to the market, anticipating
the unexpected, betting against the conventional wisdom. At the same time,
through making (and losing) money, he began to understand his own ideas
better.
In 1969 he set up a private mutual fund, registered offshore in Curacao in
the Lesser Antilles, which he later called 'Quantum' in apparent homage to
the Indeterminacy Principle of quantum mechanics formulated by Heisenberg.
Soros admits that his philosophy is more of an approach than a scientific
hypothesis, let alone a general theory. But he says it provides the
connection between the way he makes money and the way he disburses it.
In human relations - in social science, economics - objectivity is a mirage
and disequilibrium the natural state, he argues. Markets cannot properly
discount the future because ideas about the future are biased. The value of
collateral is changed by the fact of the loan against it. In other words,
beliefs alter facts. This perception, Soros says, helps him both to make
money and to target his donations in a way that will influence history in
eastern Europe and Russia.
'My financial and philanthropic activities are based on the same
philosophical idea about the relationship between participants' thinking and
the situation in which they participate,' he explained.
Soros predicted the 1987 stock market crash but lost Dollars 800m, a third
of the fund's then value, by wrongly calculating that the crash would start
in Japan. Last September he netted perhaps Dollars 2bn when he bet massively
against the European exchange rate mechanism. Since 1979 he has spent some
Dollars 100m to create his Open Society Fund, Soros Foundations and Central
European University throughout the former Communist bloc. Another Dollars
100m went recently to support Russian science.
I asked him: is it harder to get rid of money than it is to make it?
'In my case it is.'
Why is that?
'It seems to take more time and more energy. In making money you have a
bottom line which gives you a pretty firm measure of success. But when you
are trying to influence the shape of society you don't have a bottom line;
and given that all actions have unintended consequences you certainly cannot
measure success by the amount of money you give away - because that money
can easily be wasted.'
So what yardstick do you use?
'When I was confronted with closed societies the goal was simply to foster
pluralism, to enable people to do things which were not centrally determined
but autonomous and spontaneous. So we made small grants over a broad range.
'The idea was very simple: that if you expose a dogma to alternatives, it
will crumble, because it will be seen to be false once you have something to
compare it with. That was the first phase.
'Then came the hard part. Because when the Communist system collapsed you
then had to engage in a much more laborious and in many ways boring process.
You had to select key areas: the emphasis has been on education,
institution-building and the media, though there are arts programmes and
other things.'
So you won't buy into bus factories?
'Not at all - no investments. In fact, I consider it a conflict of
interest.'
This was the philosophy, but it did not fully explain the motivation. George
Soros agreed that he did not set out to make millions in order to do good
works. The careers were consecutive: he went through a sort of crisis which
ended with him delegating the fund management.
'By the end of the 1970s I was beginning to make more money than I thought I
had a use for in my personal life. So I started thinking about what to do
with it. I thought pretty hard and decided that what I cared about was this
open society.
'It was a complicated psychological development. For me making money is not
easy. To me it's always been a very painful process, very painful, involving
great suffering, actually.'
Painful in what way?
'Because if you lose money it's very painful and you can't make it without
the threat of losing it. It's by avoiding losing money that you make it, you
see. For me, investment has always been a process of pain avoidance. Pain is
at the core of the process. And in fact I am not willing to take the pain.
'I was disqualified by my success. I went through a kind of internal crisis
around 1979-82, where I had to re-evaluate what I was doing.'
You felt your life was hollow?
'No. It was a very simple quandary: am I the slave of my own success or am I
the master of my own destiny? It really was a struggle between me as a
person and my fund as an organisation. It was a struggle that I won and that
my fund actually lost - and it was translated into a physical loss in 1981.'
Although Soros is of Jewish descent - his father survived the Russian civil
war as a prisoner in Siberia - his philanthropy does not 'foster the tribal
links'. I asked if he saw himself as a sort of Robin Hood, taxing the rich
West to give to the poor East.
'Generally speaking, I am a critic. I am a critic of the processes. I am not
an entrepreneur who builds businesses, I am an investor who judges them. My
function in the financial markets is that of a critic and my critical
judgments are expressed by my decisions to buy and sell. Taxation, levying,
doesn't come into it.'
Then are you paying a debt to society which has allowed you to take so much
money from it?
'No, not in the least. I don't feel that at all. I do it because I am in a
position to do it. I have the freedom and the means. I do it because I think
it makes sense. I don't have any sense of guilt at all.'
You have said you don't regard speculation as immoral.
'No, not at all. It's a profession - in America very highly respected, here
less so. But it is a strictly professional activity.'
Do you see it as gambling?
'Not at all.'
You wouldn't call it hedging, though, would you?
'Also not, no. It's genuine speculation, speculative investment. It's
seeking a high return on capital.'
Is it a necessary function of an open society to have people like you in it?
'I think it's a necessary function for financial markets. Basically, all
investors are doing what I am doing. I'm doing it more aggressively and more
to the point, more clearly recognising what the objectives are, which is to
make money with money.'
Do you spend money on yourself? You have four houses, I believe.
'I used to collect but actually I don't have great material needs. I like my
comfort. But, really, I am a very abstract person.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / What astrologers don't know: Dominic Lawson offers a New
Year prediction: most pundits will be wrong again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY New Year brings with it a curse, and it is always the same one: the
curse of New Year forecasts.
The nation's stage army of pundits forms a queue to tell us what will happen
to the stock market, which world leaders will be up, and which down, where
house prices will be a year from now, and all the other matters beyond our
control. It is dross, from first to last. The only advantage is that we do
not have to read any of it, and can save dramatically the amount of time we
spend reading newspapers.
We can be sure of one other thing: the forecasts will be over-optimistic.
Last year not one of our leading economic forecasters predicted that the
British economy in 1992 would continue to shrink. While the Treasury's own
predictions were notably hubristic, independent pundits scarcely covered
themselves in glory. This, at least, was entirely predictable: human nature
is optimistic, and in the 20th century this has been translated into a
passionate conviction that every succeeding year must bring progress, that
our civilisation can only wax, never wane.
It is in any case an artifice to assume that the affairs of man move in
yearly cycles - the only objective difference between December 31 and
January 1 is that one is a bank holiday and the other is not. More
particularly, the Gregorian calendar bears no particular relation to the
earth's cycle. Our New Year comes in the middle of winter, when nature is
still deep in hibernation. Since the Church of England has broken
conclusively with the world-wide Catholic Church by declaring that women
shall be priests, it might as well go the whole rationalist hog and break
with Pope Gregory's calendar. Then we could celebrate the new year on an
agreed first day of Spring, along with the birds and the bees.
This is not, I hasten to add, an appeal to move to a calendar based on the
astrologers' system of planetary and solar influences. I am at least at one
with the Pope in his anathematising of astrology, if not his declaration
that to follow those spurious charts is a mortal sin.
In the tide of forecasts that wash over us each new year, the astrologers'
predictions represent the scummiest flotsam and jetsam, horoscopical
detritus. I find it depressing that the Daily Mail, probably the most
influential newspaper in Britain, should have devoted its centre pages for
most of the past week to promoting the claims of a bald, bearding astrologer
called Jonathan Cainer, who says he has developed something called
'Astroanalysis - a unique new way of seeing what the stars hold'.
Cainer previously predicted the futures of the 1m or so readers of Today
newspaper, now tells the considerably more numerous readers of the Daily
Mail that '1993 is the year that will change your life.' This is because
1993 will see 'Neptune and Uranus meet in the sky for the first time in
nearly 200 years - a rare and important conjunction which has the potential
to change our world dramatically.'
I am particularly interested in his predictions for Capricorn (December 23
to January 20): 'So much has changed in your home life you no longer feel
sure where your personality ends - and where your need to be all things to
all people begins.'
My daughter was born a week and half ago, on December 23, and unlike Cainer,
I have no idea what her character is. Had she been born a day earlier, she
would have been a Sagittarian, just like her dad, another Sagittarian. It is
just as well we didn't have her induced.
It would be wrong to think that astrology columns are the province solely of
the tabloid newspapers. Superior glossy magazines, such as Vogue and Harpers
and Queen have them. So too does the supposedly serious Sunday Times.
Indeed, recently I received a letter from the Sunday Times' astrologer,
offering to explain to me the higher points of her art. Apparently
'something' had told her that I was about to publish in The Spectator the
sort of article about astrology which might have brought her 'profession'
into disrepute. On this occasion, I am afraid, her charts have let her down.
I have one question for her. Why do astrologers base their charts on the
moment of birth, rather than the moment of conception? After all, that is
when the earth is really supposed to move.

MISS LEE, my executive assistant, was in fine form on New Year's eve. We put
on paper hats, lit the pink candles, and had partridge and raspberries. Then
we repaired to the sitting room, to await the chimes of midnight. To pass
the time, I fossicked through a book about multiple universes. Apparently
there is an infinity of universes. They pop out of nothing.
While I was wrestling with all this, Miss Lee had picked up a copy of The
Journalist's Handbook which was lying around, and was flicking through it
impatiently. She was looking particularly beautiful: a smart type of frock,
Pounds 400 shoes, hair nicely twirled, endearing crimson lipstick.
She started to laugh throatily. I asked about the cause.
Miss Lee said: 'I am reading an article by this creature Peter Fiddick which
poses the question: 'Can a 24-hour rolling news service on the BBC be
justified? Is there enough news?' Fiddick has his doubts. Regales us with
them lumpenly. In the limpest way imaginable, he wonders whether there is
enough news to sustain listeners' interest on a round-the-clock basis.
'What this creature doesn't realise is that most of humanity's problems can
be ascribed to an excess of media. There are far too many journalists, all
of them battening leech-like on what is a finite supply of news. It is my
opinion, Michael, that most of our problems in 1992 were exacerbated by the
media - not exactly caused by them but fanned and enflamed out of all
proportion.
'Take John Major and Norman Lamont. Perfectly decent men who have been
ridiculed for doing their best to wrestle with problems not of their making.
How can Major and Lamont be held responsible for German foolhardiness or the
global debt splurge?
'Or take the royal family. Look how the Queen and her hapless children were
singled out in 1992 for remorseless persecution. All families have their
problems. That is only human nature. But when Windsor Castle burned to the
ground, the media gloated - virtually suggested she rebuild it herself. When
the Queen offered to pay income tax, the media speculated on the scale of
her liabilities. When her children's marriages encountered minor
difficulties, the media snooped and eavesdropped and hounded them
unforgivably.
'If you examine the world's problems in 1992, you will see that most of them
were local difficulties that would have blown over if the media hadn't
latched on to them. When real news dries up, they feast on each another.
Look at the attention paid this week to Britain's commercial television
network. Who cares a matchstick for ITV? It is a haven for minor talent. It
is there to sell dog food. End of story.
'Or take the tabloid press. Anyone with four brain cells knows that the
tabloids are written and commissioned by menopausal men with severe sexual
hang-ups and chips on their shoulders. So let them get on with it. If the
quality newspapers would deny the tabloids the oxygen of publicity, the
tabloids would soon be read only by inmates of prisons and people in the
Navy. There are far too many newspapers. Britain could easily get by with
one pink broadsheet and one white broadsheet.'
'But which white broadsheet?' I asked.
'Certainly not The Times. I used to be fond of it. Its last editor had
knocked it into shape. But then along comes this Peter Stothard creature.
Swans in from nowhere. Fires two dozen journalists. Tosses the whole thing
in the air and rearranges it so that none of us can find our favourite
columnists or features. There is an interview in here' - she brandished The
Journalist's Handbook - 'in which this creature seeks to justify his
actions, but he doesn't fool me. What could be his problem?'
'Insecurity,' I said. 'You must remember, Miss Lee, that Stothard is a
Murdoch editor. Can you imagine what hoops of ice constricted his brain and
heart when Murdoch rang him from LA and appointed him editor? Must have been
a nightmare. He deserves our deepest sympathy.' Suddenly I felt maudlin. The
clock was close to midnight. 'This is a weary, wracked planet, Miss Lee. We
must learn to hold our tongues, learn to stay our hands. Our planet is
bleeding. It is crying for our sympathy. We are alone in the universe. We
must love one another. Let us start with this Stothard creature and take it
from there.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - Cinema:
hopelessly infatuated with its own image / Why post-modernism has become
crit-speak for narcisism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
THE WORLD of art-critical jargon today resembles one of those surreal lumber
rooms in a Giorgio Di Chirico painting. Across the floor weird constructs
like 'deconstruction' gaze at sinister compounds like 'post-modernism.' In a
corner, obscure once-meaningful diagrams gather dust. On a chair sits a
tailor's dummy, bereft of the tailor's creations that once gave it life and
purpose.
But occasionally in a Di Chirico painting something real or organic peeps
through - a flower, a human hand - to bestow a telling irony: to remind us
that there are still traces of life as we know it. Just so, the prolix
usually co-exists with the real and simple - however much it tries to
camouflage them.
Post-modernism in the cinema has now become camouflaging crit-speak for a
very simple concept: narcissism. Back in the 1970s and '80s movies such as
David Lynch's Blue Velvet or Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill in America, or
Fassbinder's films in Europe, might have been justly graced with terms from
the post-modern lexicon like 'ludic', 'eclectic,' 'self-reflexive.' They
gazed in the mirror of popular culture past and present - not just cinema
but novels, pop art, TV - and subtly, sardonically plucked meaning from
reflection and allusion.
But the habit has now spread from semi-fringe film-makers to mega-budget
directors such as Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Returns) and Francis Coppola
(the new Dracula). The art of subtle invocation has turned into the art of
show-off quotesmanship. The Batman movies, especially, are megaliths of
compressed cultural bricolage: plundering their invocations from old movie
styles (James Whale), Gothic Edwardiana (Edward Gorey), Saturday matinee
serials and the revamped Batman comics themselves. Originality begins to die
a slow death on the altar of hommage: which is, as we know, a French word
for plagiarism.
Today the cultural pay-off is becoming clear. Too often the consequence of
gazing too long in the mirror is a hopeless infatuation with one's own
image.
This year we have had movies recycling bygone film noir styles: from Light
Sleeper to Alien 3, with The Public Eye and Night And The City due in the
new year. We have had films about film-making (Barton Fink, Bugsy, The
Player, Chaplin). We have had European films holding tribunal on the
century's audio-visual culture, from old movie styles to recent movie/video
developments (Europa, Until The End Of The World). And for British
filmmakers like Terence Davies (The Long Day Closes), Derek Jarman (Edward
II) and Peter Greenaway (Prospero's Books), no film is complete without a
built-in concordance of references to cinema and/or its companion arts.
Not all these works are bad. Indeed some are good. But the trend's spreading
dominion disturbs. We could dismiss it as fin de siecle stock-taking: a
century's natural instinct as it closes down to count the bills and mark the
ledgers. (For changing millennia, multiply this by ten). But first: who
wants another eight years of aesthetic auto-erotism at the movies? And
second: how do we know that the cinema, once hung up on its own image, will
get un-hung as soon as we reach 2000?
There are two main kinds of narcissism practised today: active and passive.
The active is marginally less perilous because at least it knows what it is
up to. Taking past movie styles, it either processes them into
multi-referential camp - Lynch's Wild At Heart (cruder than Blue Velvet but
at least self-aware), Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom, Tom DiCillo's Johnny
Suede - or uses them as overt commentary on a modern story (The Long Day
Closes).
Then there is passive narcissism. Thriving in the commercial sector, this is
the short-memory self-love that produces, almost without thought, lazier and
lazier theme-and-variations packages. The motto of these films is: Close
down mental enterprise and lull the senses with familiar signals. From the
makers of Lethal Weapon and Batman here come LW3 and B2. From the makers of
Aliens 1 and 2, here is Old Scaly Claws in space again. From the makers of
Home Alone, here is another date with the kid who keeps losing his parents.
The audience approves of this studio laziness because it too likes a lazy
time. You do not have to dress up so much on a second date, and all the
introductory small talk was got over on the first one.
But then with narcissistic romances you do not really have to dress up at
all. Modern cinema is in danger of becoming a hall of mirrors in which
filmgoers and filmmakers alike can gaze into an endless vista of
self-gratifying, self-imaging sameness. An art for which the mirror, in
great cinematic hands, was once an eerie leitmotif that deceived, distorted
or seduced - in Welles, in Losey, in Lang, in Cocteau's Orphee - now shows
signs of falling headlong into its reflective, oblivion-inducing depths.

FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - Theatre and
Dance: deconstructionism without tears / To apply academic talk to trash
gets nobody anywhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
ENGLISH theatre is still a terrain remarkably innocent of intellectual
parlance. The word 'deconstructionist' is applied far less often than in
opera; the words 'post-modern' and 'post-modernist' less often than in
dance. In fact, the dominant buzzword of the day is 'accessible' - a word
anti-intellectual in its implications.
This reflects the amount of popular entertainment - and unsubsidised theatre
 -around. (Our public is less worried by whether a show is new-wave,
academically hip or politically correct than by whether it is just a good
show, and in that sense our public it has its heart in the right place.) But
it also reflects the traditionalism, even insularity, of the English. More
Pinero than Brecht is still being played. The many excellent features of
British theatre are almost all traditional virtues. But can there be
post-modernism on terrain where modernism has hardly taken root?
To some extent. People have tried slapping the label 'post-modern' on West
End shows such as Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon - 'post-modern' in
their Trump Tower mixture of lavish production values and populist
entertainment - but it does not really stick, mainly because to apply
academic talk to such trash gets nobody anywhere. 'Post-modernism' is
exemplified not by trash (however appealing) but by works that ecletically
incorporate some features of trash - boutique art, glitz design, democratic
accessibility - into a conscious (often historically conscious) work of art.
An obvious example is Tony Harrison's The Trackers of Oxyrrynchus (National
Theatre, 1989). This was a highly knowing work, using the old satyr plays of
the Greeks as a platform on which to discuss the importance of popular
entertainment within high art. The satyrs were Priapic (with huge phalluses
beaming up from their loins) and pop (they tap-danced heavily) and they made
a point about the way that modern theatre has been divorcing low culture
from high culture. As with so many post-modern works, there was something of
an art-history lecture about it. I would say that to the extent one was made
conscious of this, Trackers failed as art; but thereby hangs a debate too
big for this space.
'Post-structuralism' occurs where the unquestioned premises (usually
sociological) of one tale are questioned or revealed in another, or where an
existing work of art, or art form, is framed and examined within another. A
simple instance is Tom Stoppard's Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. A
remarkable work of theatre in itself, its basis is that the story of Hamlet
is occurring, mainly to other characters, just around the corner; and so it
leads you to re-examine issues that, in making Hamlet, Shakespeare took for
granted.
An increasing number of plays today are about missing characters in famous
works of art (Helen Cooper's Mrs Vershinin), real artists and their critics
(Alan Bennett's Kafka's Dick, the other people involved in the creation of
art (the TS Eliot play Tom and Viv), or the whole culture surrounding the
creation of art (Timberlake Wertenbaker's Three Birds Alighting on a Field).
All of these qualify as post-modern; all of them involve some measure of
both structuralism and deconstructionism; and most of them are rooted in
feminism - the most widely influential 'new' factor in the creation of art
today.
*****
Is there deconstructionism without tears? Yes - and in dance. Just watch The
Hard Nut - the choreographer's Mark Morris's version of (of all things) The
Nutcracker (1991 - soon on TV). Everyone thinks of The Nutcracker as a
ballet, and everyone thinks of ballet as a basically Eurocentric and
hierarchical form of entertainment - a wedding-cake rising in tiers to the
ultra-white prima ballerina: who is in The Nutcracker the Sugar Plum Fairy.
But Morris (now aged 36) is an artist with an essentially 1960s sensibility.
He sets The Hard Nut in the American '60s, and what he deconstructs is
ballet itself.
In The Hard Nut men may dance on point too; but here pointwork gives
superiority to no one. The dancers are of all colours; and the traditional
virtuoso steps of ballet are given not to the stars but to the ensemble.
There is no Sugar Plum; and the heroine, Marie, is barefoot.
The Hard Nut is also a post-modern work in the way it commutes between high
art and popular culture, and in its way of commenting on, or framing,
another work of art. It retells Hoffmann's original Nutcracker story in a
1960s setting. It moves from kids watching the Hard Nut story on
black-and-white TV, through a party where adults do all kinds of groovy '60s
dances, take drugs, quarrel and upset their kids, and finally (like The
Wizard of Oz) enters a world of colour and magic. And its message (all you
need is love) illustrates Sixties utopianism.
There are other labels that can be slapped on The Hard Nut and on Morris's
choreography in general. Most of his work, in the core of its dance style,
is multiculturalist - with elements of flamenco, Indian, ballet, modern and
much more co-existing. His 1987 trilogy Mythologies - a dance illustration
of the sociological deconstructionism of Roland Barthes's Mythologies - was
about popular culture: its three parts were Soap Powders and Detergents,
Striptease and Championship Wrestling.
If The Hard Nut were only a piece of deconstructionism or post-modernism, it
would not be a work of art - merely an intellectual construct. There are
some other artists who similarly illustrate the complexities of our culture.
But I attend at some length to Morris because no one else is doing so on
such a scale of consequence.

FT  02 JAN 93 / State of the Art: Raiders of the cultural past - European

or 'grosses legumes', as the French say - on the Paris stage are a Briton
rewriting a French opera, an Egyptian making a film show on the sacred
boards of the Comedie Francaise, and an American directing German actors in
a language they have never spoken before.
Peter Brook's Impressions of Pelleas, Yossif Chahine's Caligula and Bob
Wilson's Dr Faustus are stamped with the vision of three of Europe's
greatest directors. In all, multi-cultural strangeness and splendour
intoxicates, hints at shifting perspectives, changing realities. In Faustus,
three actors simultaneously play the hero; Pelleas has different actresses -
Chinese, Japanese, Korean - as the heroine on consecutive nights. It is
drama as haphazardly personal, fluid, unfixed. It is also highly stylised,
presenting a deliberately unreal imaginative world.
Here is the director as star: after 30 seconds you see at once Wilson's
hallmark - cold artifice - or Brook's mix of the exotic and intimately
simple. Drama, with its demand that the director realise his own view of a
play, has always been a deconstructionist's paradise. But among Europe's
theatre pioneers, we now see a late 20th century trend which parallels
post-modern developments in other arts.
One feature is a move away from the straight play to a collage of devices -
mime, acrobatics, dance, rock, film. Mostly these imposed stylisations - the
pleasure lies in the aesthetic pattern, unity of music, movement, design,
not in story or naturalistic character. A director such as Chahine makes
political points this way; others, such as Wilson, are aesthetes offering no
meaning beyond the stage. All are part of a post-modern trend in which
language is no longer the main route to meaning; dramatic impetus is not
verbal but visual, physical, spiritual.
Multi-culturalism is at the core of this phenomenon in Europe. It embodies
relativity of meaning, and it liberates directors from traditional texts and
conventional staging. It is no chance that the explorers are multi-lingual:
Brook, Wilson, Chahine, Ruth Berghaus, Peter Zadek, Luc Bondy may work in
French, German, English. The most exciting shows in Europe are translations,
radical revisions - Brook chops Debussy's opera in half and plays it with
just a piano - or works which barely have a text. All reflects a sense of
fragmentation throughout politics and culture.
Brook's Paris Tempest, with magic, acrobatics, an Indian Prospero, a black
Ariel, showed how translation turned Shakespeare 'into something rich and
strange'. For Pelleas the cavernous Bouffes du Nord venue is a fin-de-siecle
bourgeois interior with Persian carpets, Chinese vases and Japanese screens.
Fixing the oppressive mood of Maeterlinck's play the oriental actresses
playing Melisande are women from another milieu; the acting, trembling,
precise, understated, recalls the Tempest; gestures, eyes looking away
suggest souls - Prospero, Pelleas - lost in themselves. The essential is
unexpressed but subtly evoked - perfect for Maeterlinck's symbolist theatre
of silence, and for Brook's vision of intimacy and foreboding.
Where Brook has exoticism, Wilson has an abstract finesse at once
sophisticated and naive. His surrealism owes a debt to Tadeusz Kantor, whose
apocalyptic view of history as a cacophony of mass terror is enacted by
black and white ghost-figures miming or jerking into action as in early
movies to the jangle of guns, machines or folk music; there is no text.
Kantor's great Krakow show, Today's My Birthday, still tours Europe. It
echoes in Wilson's masterpiece, The Black Rider and in the weaker Dr
Faustus.
Wilson's figures, chalky faced, eyes blackened, move in irregular jumps. The
motif is cold angularity - crooked chairs six feet high, trees as scissor
cut-outs, costumes with jagged edges, a red stiletto heel jutting from a
slit in a box. Music, mime, dance, starts and stops abruptly. But it is also
an enticing nursery rhyme world: pink neon, a big pulpy moon; the devil in
Faustus, the lovers in The Black Rider, float upstage on swings.
The limit of language is Wilson's obsession. In the 'spoken opera' Faustus,
a German cast who first had to learn English, chant monosyllabic verse as
parrot grammar, maddeningly meaningless. In Wilson's new show, a musical
Alice in Wonderland, 'a word means just what I choose it to mean'. For The
Black Rider William Burroughs' banal German-English ballads match the
fairground kitsch of Tom Waits' tunes. It is art for art's sake, but
Wilson's brittle-cruel-romantic collages work because they dramatise love,
death, in a brilliantly realised, unified imagery.
Only Ruth Berghaus equals Wilson's intense abstraction. Her Hamburg Jungle
of Cities is a Brecht collectors item, a mechanised choreographic nightmare
where words hardly matter. A criss-cross of railway lines is backed by a
silhouette of skyscrapers; people enter via windows, fall into pits, as a
huge tent moves menacingly across the stage to devour all: a surreal
updating of Brecht's alienation effect.
The cityscape is the theatrical image of our time. Most influential has been
Peter Zadek's in his Vienna Merchant of Venice, relocated to Wall Street as
a satire on yuppies and a parable of survival in a brash society. The set
parodies post-modern architecture - a Richard Rodgers dream bank of steel
tubes, glass frames, mirrored panels rises to the loft of the stage - and
has sent deconstructionist echoes through many productions. The giant
lift-mirror in Bondy's Berlin Final Chorus, for example, reflects both the
mad looking glass world of bourgeois society and the audiences reaction to
it.
Chahine's Caligula is the pinnacle of this style. A huge tower block is also
a screen projecting a modern city, moving crowds, Caligula magnified as a
crazed dictator. At the end, this terrific structure disintegrates in
flames, casting out changing images, different in each part of the
auditorium. It suggests how random is our vision - sideshows range from Arab
tambourinists to punk acrobats - and how we distance terror as it is
stylised by televisual repetition.
Caligula wittily and vibrantly uses non-traditional theatre forms to
deconstruct our culture; the set is an emblem of the theme. It pinpoints a
new visual, physical drama which should spread further this decade. Since
European theatre thrives on cultural exchange, and language is of secondary
importance, it is to be hoped that more such pieces - only Pelleas is
planned for Glasgow - will visit Britain.

gives his verdict on the Christmas literary competitions

CLERIHEW-composing can easily become an addictive occupation, as many
competitors confessed. 'Once one has started,' said Christopher Mylne, 'it
is difficult to stop thinking up silly rhymes to fit - though I admit to
being defeated by Tchaikovsky. . .'
The task, you will recall, was to make up new clerihews about composers and
musicians. Mr C. Thwaites reminded me of 'an oldie but goodie' - Jules
Massenet/ Never wrote /A Mass/ In A. And Mary Holtby remembered from
childhood another vintage item - Palestrina/ Wrote a concerto for the
concertina/ Which Monteverdi/ Orchestrated for the hurdy-gurdy.
No one thought of including any of my music critic friends on the lines of
this one, c1930: 'Next week', said Ernest Newman,/ 'It will be Schumann'./
But when next week came/ It was Wagner just the same.
I had to stop counting the number of times conductors such as Henry Wood or
Andre Previn or George Solti (another difficult rhyme) sat on/ the baton; or
the occasions when Maria Callas/ sang in Dallas; or when some poor composer
could not hold a candle/ to Handel. Pavarotti was frequently grotty, and
quite often dotty, and there were unkind observations as to the size of his
botty. Nigel Kennedy was more often than not discovered playing a threnody
with the aggressive termination from Freda Smithson of an over-ripe tomato/
interrupting his pizzicato.
Johann Sebastian Bach/ always got up with the lark (Dian Shervinton), or if
not, he sat in the dark (W. Roll) but that - as more than one entry pointed
out - did not curtail his procreative prowess. In contrast, Mahler sat in
the parlour (E Gifford) whereas Bizet/ sat on a bidet (Garbis Haddad),
Scriabin/ made an awful din (Graham Green), Souza was/ a bit of a boozer
(Andrew Stark) and Liszt was frequently hissed (B. Miller) and often, of
course, kissed, and on at least one occasion pissed (Ranald Boyle).
No cookie was shrewder, rhymed Eve Turner neatly, than Buxtehude. Sir Arnold
Bax Had no FAX (Brian Capon) (they had not been invented); Placido Domingo,
was said by Henry Moxon, to be always lucky at bingo, but, added Anthony
Brown, of that game Kiri/ Is weary. Hugo Wolf/ played golf (Peter J
Andrews), Humperdinck/ had rum to drink (Robin Fuller) and Schumann was only
human (Bernard McGinley).
Over fondness for pasta seemed to be the main affliction of Italian
musicians. Donizetti was addicted to spaghetti (OVS Heath), Boccherini to
fetuccini and tortellini (James Robertson) and Stefan Grapelli to
tagliatelli (Steven Berry). Puccini, however, suffered from baby marrows and
threw away his zucchini (Simon Hubbard-Ford).
Duke Ellington's penchant was somewhat implausibly for wellingtons
(Catherine Presswood), but Shirley Bassey had, more realistically, an
eloquent chassis (Sylvia Trump) and one that is classy (Eric Pearce).
Several people had James Galway either leaving or not leaving his flute in
the hallway. D. Rhys-Williams envisaged Neil Kinnock in a dispute over Early
Music with Trevor Pinnock. And Isobel Baillie/ Raised high notes gaily (WID
Scott).
It was Peter Read who, when he switched on the Beeb/, ingeniously listened
to the strains of Delibes. George Formby, we are assured by John Adams, once
passed through the village of Quarmby.
No one found a convincing rhyme for Kanawa. Nor for Rameau, who was
learnedly celebrated by William and Jo Godfree (though this year is not, as
they seemed to think, the 300th anniversary of his birth in 1683). Brahms
appeared to be a favourite with the Thane of Glamis and also to have qualms/
When Joachim/ offered to have a go at him (Sir Toby Weaver).
Monica G Ribon voiced a universal dilemma when she asked Does Turandot/
Rhyme with 'forgot'/ Or is it Turandot/ As in 'I don't know'? Chopin was
hopin' (ouch]) to play with one hand/ on George Sand (Katie Mallett) and
Tristan told Isolde/ 'You don't look a day older' . . . (David Hussey). Both
Eve Turner and Prudence Raper had musicians taking Valium before embarking
on Spem in Alium.
The problem in many cases was the second couplet. So often a brilliant
beginning had crashed into bathos by line four. It is much more difficult to
compose a memorable clerihew than it looks. Perhaps the trick is not to try
too hard for your punch-line but just let it come naturally of its own
accord. Anyway, Pounds 30 each to all those whose clerihews are printed
below. They are the joint winners.

FOR our second competition you were asked to send an extract from the
obituary of any fictional character. The deadpan style of the obituarist -
often skating on some pretty thin ice - is not difficult to mimic. Many of
the many attempts managed it all too convincingly.
Subjects for burial began with legendary and biblical figures such as the
Devil, Methusaleh (' . . . born into one of the oldest families on record .
. . was just at the peak of his career' - Marius Szafianski) Achilles,
Jonah, Grendel's Mother, the Ancient Mariner (' . . . although suffering
from a withered arm, his eyes never lost their glittering power' - J E
Smith).
King Arthur, Ulysses, Don Quixote, Brunnhilde ('Following her husband's
tragic death in a mugging incident, her name was romantically linked to that
of Gunther the Gibichung.' - Anthony Lyman-Dixon), Gandalf, The Pied Piper
('In an inspired career move, he became a pest control officer for the Weser
valley' - Mrs H. C Lee), The Wife of Bath ('It is heartening to think that
our sister's long battle with the Orthodontists is now over' - J McCormick),
were popular obituarees.
There were contemporaries such as Adrian Mole ('Although only in his 14th
year, Mole's perceptive analyses of family life and the strains implicit in
modern marriage, minutely chronicled as part of his daily observations, will
be immensely valued by future researchers' - D A Prince), Horace Rumpole and
Lord Dixon of Bushy Park ('Populary known as 'Lucky Jim' he made a
significant contribution to the dissemination of higher education' - Peter
Knight).
Characters from crime fiction were also popular candidates with Sherlock
Holmes, hotly pursued gravewards by Moriarty, Miss Marple, Poirot, Peter
Wimsey, and several James Bonds.
Shakespeare was a prime source. Lady Macbeth 'was a legendary hostess.
Dinner parties at Forres, begun with a sonorous knocking on the South
Chamber door, were eagerly attended by luminaries from every shade of the
political spectrum' (Guy Thomas).
Evelyn I Stark told us that: 'Financial circles were shocked to learn
yesterday of the murder of Polonius in what appears to have been a case of
mistaken identity. His 'Neither a borrower nor a lender be' speech, known as
the 'Elsinore Document' . . . has recently been adopted by many treasury
officials and advocates tight control of the money supply.'
S L Valdez chronicled the last days of King Lear: 'After fierce arguments
with his daughters, the king declared himself homeless and applied to
Berkshire County Council for assistance on the grounds of former residence
in Windsor. When this was turned down, the king joined fellow subjects in
Windsor Great Park's 'cardboard city' during the worst of the winter storms
and later collapsed'.
Dickens also inspired some brave efforts - Oliver Twist, for example: 'From
the earliest he scandalised devoted carers by his excessive gluttony; then
in his first employment, not only bullied his fellow workers, but left
without heeding statutory notice requirements' - Ken Turner.
There were several shots at Heathcliff with a noble attempt at his family
tree from John Rosselli. Then we had Bloom; Stephen Dedalus - ' . . . blown
up and killed by a terrorist bomb which he was about to plant in the lobby
of the Gresham Hotel in Dublin' - Shedden Alexander; Goldfinger; Anna
Karenina; Mr Collins ' . . . distinguished by his opposition to women's
ordination' - Mrs Patricia C Atkinson; both Dr and Mrs Proudie; Albertine in
one massive Proustian sentence (Alan Leslie) and many Bertie Woosters and
Billy Bunters (see the example below).
Even more persistent were figures from nursery rhyme and children's
literature with the death of Cock Robin way ahead at the top followed by
Snow White, Peter Pan, Peter Rabbit, BB Wolf, Miss Piggy, Noddy, Humpty
Dumpty - 'he was a good egg' (passim).
In fact, there was such a wealth of talent that the task of choosing the
eventual winners was even more fraught than usual. However here goes -
Pounds 50 each to those whose entries are printed below. They are
joint-winners, and thanks to everyone for a splendid record-breaking entry.
R I P
SHYLOCK Shylock was perhaps the most innovative financier of his time, and
his influence put Venetian capital markets on a more regulated footing. In
an era of speculative excess, when venture capital was frequently provided
on an 'old boy' basis, Shylock, a relative outsider, introduced loan
financing by way of the fixed-interest bond. His creative flair, however,
was seen to most effect in his novel penalty clauses, which gave the
bond-holder an exceptionally strong incentive to redeem the bond at the due
date. These instruments became known as 'funk bonds'.
His career ended controversially, in the so-called 'Balthazar Affair' (named
after the famous disappearing barrister), when Shylock's commercial logic
proved stronger meat than the business community of the day could stomach.
There are many, however, who believe that his trial verdict was unsafe.
(Noel Petty) CAPULET / MONTAGUE The dangers of drug abuse have been
highlighted this week by the tragic deaths of teenagers Juliet Capulet and
Romeo Montague. Fourteen-year-old Juliet had apparently undegone a form of
marriage to Montague against her father's wishes and she went into a coma as
a result of a strong barbiturate, taken deliberately to feign death. Young
Montague was unaware of her action and took an overdose. Upon waking from
the coma Juliet took her own life. The role of the church in this sorry
affair is somewhat dubious as it seem the drugs were supplied by churchmen.
The Vatican has promised a full inquiry.
(Mrs A D Woodhouse) MR DORIAN GRAY The death has been reported of Mr Dorian
Gray of Mayfair, the well-known bon vivant and patron of the arts. He was
discovered by servants at home, apparently having suffered fatal injuries
whilst attempting to repair a previously unknown portrait of a young man,
possibly a relative. Although Mr Gray was well known in his role of
aficionado of the theatre, opera and the art world, little was known about
his background. Even his age was closely guarded secret.
(C E Hurst) SIR WILLIAM BUNTER, KBE, MP The death of the former Chancellor,
Sir William Bunter, has shocked everyone, especially a surprising number who
enjoyed a friendship going back to Oxford and even Greyfriars.
Throughout his comparatively short life he remained irrepressibly
optimistic, whether over an expected postal order or the green shoots of
economic recovery.
Sir William's career was not without controversy, both trivial, involving
tuck-shops and off-licenses, and of more moment concerning the acquisition
of public funds for private use, for example, when his probity was
questioned, but always he contrived to extricate himself from a situation
that might well, to a lesser mortal, have spelt disgrace.
(RG Snoxell) CHRISTIAN Our neighbour Christian will come no more amongst us.
Owing to a burden on his back, he had some frenzy-distemper which drove him
to seek a Kingdom where he would have a Crown of Glory and be clothed with
Immortality.
We saw him afar fall into a slough, but he dragged himself out and passed
through a wicket-gate. There were lions in the path, a foul fiend, Apollyon,
a Fair wherein were many vain persons, and he in danger of execution,
Death's shadowy Vale and Giant Despair's Doubting Castle . . .
After so vile a journey he crossed a deep river and thence came to a city
filled with Trumpets and Harps and Streets of Gold. But he that hath told us
of the Pilgrimage hath lately confessed ''Twas but a dream'. Christian is
surely lying beneath those waters whither we have no stomach to follow him.
(KP Hopkinson) MR S. GRUNDY The premature death of Solomon Grundy was widely
mourned by his many relatives and friends. His rapid and brilliant
maturation was due to diet - a lesson to us all.
He was born on Monday, christened on Tuesday and remained a life-long
Anglican. At an unusually early age, he was married on Wednesday. This was
an enduringly happy union, despite adverse comment from some sections of the
press.
An obscure disease overtook him on Thursday. His condition worsened on
Friday. Every effort was made to save him, but he died on Saturday. Full of
honours, he was buried on Sunday.
He is survived by his childless widow.
Beatification is in progress.
(A G Cheston)

FT  02 JAN 93 / Books: Art for rich and poorer - A highly varied crop of
books on art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WINTER has seen the launch of two new series of decorative arts books,
impressive in quite different ways. A massive 30-volume survey of the arts
of Islam opens with three opulent volumes on Qur'ans, The Abbasid Tradition,
The Master Scribes and After Timur, intelligently produced and sumptuously
illustrated (Azimuth Editions in association with Oxford University Press,
Pounds 135 each). This exceptionally ambitious, and heavily subsidised,
series catalogues the entire 20,000-piece collection of Dr Nasser D. Khalili
 -at a cost of Pounds 5m.
At the other end of the financial scale is Walker Books' delightful new
Decorative Arts Library. Bevis Hillier offers an entertaining romp through
Early English Porcelain, unable to resist including the tale of the Blake
family who ordered a dinner service from China decorated with their coat of
arms. When the porcelain arrived they discovered that on every piece their
family motto, Think and Thank, had been painstakingly rendered Stink and
Stank.
Laurence Whistler contributes Point Engraving on Glass, Emma Tennant Rag
Rugs of England and America, and Alan Powers Modern Block Printed Textiles.
These attractive small books cost Pounds 9.99 each,
Anna Maria Massinelli and Filipp Tuena have achieved on paper what would be
seventh heaven in an exhibition. Treasures of the Medici (Thames &amp; Hudson,
Pounds 24.95) re-unites the fabulous jewels and objets d'art amassed over
300 years by 10 generations of Medici, bankers who were the unoffical royal
family of Florence. For Lorenzo the Magnificent, the 5th centenary of whose
death this superbly illustrated book commemorates, his antique cameos and
sardonyxes were of incomparably greater value than any painting by Fra
Angelico or Botticelli.
Monique Riccardi-Cubitt's compendious The Art of the Cabinet (Thames and
Hudson, Pounds 36) offers a history of the cupboard or cabinet in which such
precious curios were housed. Furniture plays an important role in Alexander
von Vegesack's illuminating Czech Cubism (Laurence King Publishing, Pounds
40). This fascinating journey into hitherto unchartered waters reveals how a
group of avant-garde architects in Prague translated the art of Braque and
Picasso into a new - almost angrily animate - formal language of
architecture and the applied arts, characterised by sharp angles, cut-off
corners and boldly sloping planes.
Five books on the 19th century focus on the forgotten and the familiar. Poul
Vad presents a welcome biography, the first in English, of one of the most
remarkable and individual painters of the 19th century. Vilhelm Hammershoi
and Danish Art at the Turn of the Century (Yale University Press, Pounds 45)
is a sensitive and scrupulously researched book, ill-served by a lamentable
translation. The author has uncovered a great deal about the life of this
most private of painters but perhaps devotes too much space to lengthy
analyses of individual works.
Janis A. Tomlinson's Goya in the Twilight of Enlightenment (Yale Pounds
29.95) is a complex and sophisticated book that attempts to cut through the
Goya myths and to examine afresh a great painter's achievement against the
historical background that so profoundly affected it. Far more
straightforward is the handsome Degas Pastels by Jean Sutherland Boggs and
Anne Maheux (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 45).
Degas also takes a bow in Beyond Impressionism - the Naturalist Impulse in
European Art 1860-1905 by Gabriel P Weisberg (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 38)
but he plays only a bit part in this truly international resurrection of
dead reputations. This is a glimpse through the looking-glass into a world
where Bastien-Lepage - not Manet, Monet or Cezanne - is king. A long overdue
alternative history of 19th century European art.
Charlotte Gere's Nineteenth Century Interiors: An Album of Watercolours
Watercolours (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 28) is a record of what must have been
a delightful show at the Frick Collection, presenting over 60 faithful view
of European interiors, from the grandest to the most humble.
Now that annus horribilis has drawn to a close, the present owner may well
console herself by curling up with Christopher Lloyd's The Royal Collection
(Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 25), a fuller-bodied version of what has proved
to be an admirably lucid and ungimmicky television series.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Books: Hungarian feast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE translated English (by Imre Goldstein) of George Konrad's A Feast in the
Garden (Faber and Faber Pounds 14.99, 395 pages) is rich and lively. This
work is copious in every way, a magnum opus by one of Hungary's leading
authors here, as he puts it on his second page, 'sentenced to examine
myself. To dissect myself in the morgue of my own conscience.' The analysis
is complex and difficult, full of vigorous reflections on fiction and
morality, and takes the form of a kind of phantasmagoric symposium in which
the author and the central figures of his world gather at a feast in his
Budapest garden re-live, each in his or her own person, their lives as
affected by the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Much of it is harrowing, yet the
overall mood is life-affirming, and Konrad is able to luxuriate in his
book's ingenious and prismatic structure.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Property: US development with a Scottish accent - A look at
a group of holiday properties near Florida's Vero Beach that is attracting
the attention of British investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ENCLAVE of 46 properties is being built above Vero Beach on the north
east Florida coast - and the accents are more likely to be Scottish than
American. For this is St Andrews Village, 12 acres of land between the coast
and the inland waterway. The site was found by Len Sculthorp who, with his
son Brian, is a partner in Edinburgh-based St Andrews Properties, which is
developing the village.
The Sculthorp family plans to keep a corner for its own holiday home and
build houses and apartments for sale on the rest of the land.
The first properties are just coming on the market and have been attracting
the attention of Scots, although all buyers are welcome.
Both Sculthorps are chartered accountants - the son has also become a
qualified real estate agent in Florida.
Until now the company has been converting and renting holiday properties in
three complexes of farm buildings in Scotland.
Drawing on this experience, it is developing its first overseas project and
the first in which it will sell the holiday homes.
The family's group of companies in Scotland, which includes a travel agency
and a selling and rental agency, is able to assist buyers.
The site, in Brevard county, is 90 minutes' drive from Orlando's
international airport and has an attractive range of entertainment
attractions, headed by Disney World.
Vero Beach does not have an obvious tourist image. It is a waterside
district of expensive homes screened from broad grass-verged roads by banks
of shrubs and palms.
Residents, in appropriate transport, cruise along the 55-mile limit roads or
the waterways running parallel with the coast. You rarely see anyone
walking.
There are boutiques, hypermarkets and the Windsor polo club. The development
company claims a year-round season, with European visitors in summer and
north American visitors avoiding the harsh weather in winter.
The village is to have a choice of property types.
There will be a row of garden homes - pairs of single storey three-bedroom,
two-bathroom houses, with multi-level roofs. They are designed so that each
pair looks like a single detached house. Front doors are on different sides,
so that no property overlooks the other's entrance.
With construction going ahead, they are now being offered on the market.
They have large living rooms with vaulted ceilings, sizeable kitchens behind
breakfast bars. Florida's favourite room, the gauze-walled lanai, that keeps
off insects and the strongest of the sun's rays, forms an extension of
living areas. There are integral garages.
Later, across the winding road running through the estate, there will be
two-storey detached family houses.
But before that the Carriage homes will be available.
These are also an ingenious design by the Evans Group, an architectural
practice whose ability to create interest through variations in ceiling
heights and roof shapes has become a trademark.
These properties are two, two-storey pitched-roof blocks, each with eight
apartments.
They have two or three bedrooms and two bathrooms, living room and lanai.
Each has its own separate entrance and garage within the block.
Each apartment looks on to the Indian river waterway, getting the full
benefit of sunsets.
In keeping with today's environment consciousness, the company uses
aluminium studs in the construction, which it says saves timber.
Some of the area available for development includes land used as a breeding
ground by sea turtles. That part of the cabbage-palm and scrub-oak covered
land is being left untouched.
The estate will have a lake, communal swimming pool, boat dock and fishing
pier. An adjoining larger development has a tennis club that St Andrews
residents can join.
There are golf courses within easy reach. The estate will be gated and have
on-site management.
St Andrews Properties will handle renting for owners if this is required.
Property prices range from about Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 100,000, depending
on the exchange rate. Related expenses will average about Pounds 300 a
month.
Foreigners cannot normally spend more than six months of a year in the US.
The company suggests that this rule, where it applies to the retired, may be
eased in four or five years, but other people are not quite as optimistic.
Assuming a buyer took a 70 per cent mortgage, which should be possible, and
allowing for costs including a furniture package, total funds required
initially could be from Pounds 32,000, according to the company's estimates.
It suggests other financing options, including shared or company ownership.
St Andrews Properties is prepared to market rentals through its connections
in Florida, Canada and estimates owners could break-even on finance and
property costs from about 50 per cent rental occupancy.
Further information from St Andrews Village, Florida, tel 407 952 5298, or
in the UK from St Andrews Properties, Edinburgh, 031-552-0666.
A large choice of developments are offered as holiday home-cum-investment
dealsin Florida and there is a lot you should know before you buy. Some
areas have restrictions on short-term letting - although not Brevard county
 -and the competition is intense.
Lindsay Cameron, director of the trade and investment division of Florida
Department of Commerce, in London, says Florida is not quite as aggressive
as California in that respect.
But people who take a Florida holiday and decide they want to buy and let,
should not rush into anything.
Certainly they should not plan to build themselves, without information
about the zoning and planning laws.
These aspects are becoming a lot tougher, says Cameron. It could prove very
costly and time-consuming putting right a wrong choice.
Too many people in holiday mood do not do the sort of checking they would if
buying a property at home. Talk to knowledgeable people in the district,
before you make a decision, advises Cameron.
There are local chambers of commerce in all areas. They will recommend a
responsible broker, or property lawyer, to guide you.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Sport: Seles tightens grip on women's ranks - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 22-year-old American, Jim Courier, narrowly, and the remarkable
18-year-old Monica Seles outstandingly, were the best players of 1992. They
head my annual rankings which have been unusually difficult to compile,
particularly for the men.
A year ago Stefan Edberg was the best male performer and his tussle with
Courier for the No. 1 ranking on the ATP tour computer has been one of the
features of the year. The computer, though, does not tell the whole story.
Only a player's best 14 results are taken into account. Furthermore, there
is too small a differential between the four Grand Slam Championships and
the other events. Nor does it include the Olympic Games - a serious
omission. Judgement must be brought to bear on the worth of each particular
performance, depending on the stature of the tournament and strength of the
field.
Courier's two Grand Slam successes in Australia and France were not matched
by anyone else, and his dominance during the early part of the year - when
he won three other titles - kept him ahead of Edberg. But the Swede had a
fine year. He retained his US Open crown with an amazing performance of
physical and mental resilience, was a finalist at the Australian Open and
won two other titles.
Andre Agassi's dramatic victory at Wimbledon, his first Grand Slam success,
was the season's outstanding performance. Taken with his wins in Atlanta and
Toronto, plus his contribution to the winning Davis Cup effort by the US,
put him in third place.
It was difficult to separate Goran Ivanisevic, a left-handed Croatian who
served 1,066 aces during the year, and the powerful American Pete Sampras,
another 20-year old. Ivanisevic was a finalist at Wimbledon, Sampras at the
US Open - both reached the semi-finals at the two season-ending
extravaganzas, the ATP Tour Championships and the Compaq Grand Slam Cup.
Sampras reached the last four at Wimbledon but Ivanisevic did the same at
the Olympics where Sampras only reached the third round.
Boris Becker won five tournaments and although he failed at the Olympic
Games, his late-season charge at the ATP Tour Championship in Frankfurt was
of such quality that I place the 25-year-old German ahead of the Olympic
champion Marc Rosset.
He crushed Ferreira; he annihilated Courier, supposedly the world's best
clay court player, he beat Emilio Sanchez in his home town before ending the
brave run of an exhausted Ivanisevic. In the final Rosset fought back to
beat the local hero Jordi Arrese in five sets.
Michael Chang won three early tournaments and, after failing to impress in
three Grand Slams and the Olympics, produced some remarkable tennis to surge
to the semi-finals of the US Open. There he pushed Edberg to the limits in
one of the year's best matches.
In the women's game it was Monica Seles first, the rest nowhere. She won 10
tournaments and in the year's great events was defeated only at Wimbledon.
There it was as much the grunting issue as Steffi Graf's superb play that
led to her defeat. It is hard to believe that this remarkably mature
double-hander is still 18.
Graf, also the finalist in Paris, was a clear second. Her defeat in the
Olympic final at the hands of Jennifer Capriati was a terrible blow to her
confidence and may have contributed to a dismal end to the year. She fell to
Sanchez-Vicario in the quarters at the US Open and to Lori McNeil in the
first round of the Virginia Slims.
Sanchez was a worthy third by virtue of her insatiable appetite for work
(she played a record 167 matches in 1992) and her consistency. Arantxa won
two tournaments and was the finalist at the US Open. She reached the last
four at the Australian and French Opens. She beat Graf at the US Open. Her
victory over Seles was at the minor Canadian Open.
The Olympic win by Jennifer Capriati over Graf, plus her defeat of Seles in
the quarter-finals of the Lipton in March, lifted the 16-year-old to fourth.
It was the manner of those wins that was so impressive - a fearless search
for the lines with raking drives, plus the odd excursion to the net behind
some intelligent serving.
Gabriela Sabatini had a disappointing year with three semi- finals the sum
of her Grand Prix efforts. The prospect of her building on her 1990 US Open
win seems more and more unlikely as the pack of younger players closes in.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Skiing: Hidden menace of summer meadows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BEFORE the snows came in Switzerland's picturesque Grisons region, the
farmers of Davos and Klosters brought their herds of cattle down from the
Alpine pastures in a ceremony known locally as die Schwiegermutter begraben
 -'burying the mother-in-law'. The mother-in-law, in this slightly
uncomfortable analogy, is the symbol of the barren and empty alp.
The arrival of snow changes the whole personality of a ski resort. Most
skiers rarely worry about what lies beneath the snow they are skiing on. But
it is often useful for high-mountain guides to 'walk' off-piste terrain
during the summer or early autumn months to complement the understanding of
snow conditions, depths and hidden hazards they may encounter with skiers
during the winter. It is especially useful in glacier regions to gauge the
extent and drift of crevasses.
Seeing a ski resort without snow can be a fascinating experience. The
universally-feared Streiff run on Kitzbuhel's Hahnenkamm looks almost
idyllic without the layer of sheet-ice deliberately engineered to prevent
racers breaking through and catching a potentially-disastrous edge.
Zermatt's steep slopes are awash with colour as wild flowers delight the eye
and scent the breeze.
Like a steep-sided meadow, the dreaded Gotschnawang area in Klosters - where
five years ago an avalanche killed Major Hugh Lindsay and came close to
engulfing his friend, the Prince of Wales - looked extraordinarily bland and
innocent as the late afternoon sun lingered lazily on its leafy banks. It is
dangerous because it is prone to avalanche rather than because it is
technically difficult.
We walked up and over the great Grisons alps between Davos and Arosa, a tour
undertaken over a century ago by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the first Briton to
accomplish this route on skis. His wife was being treated for tuberculosis
at a clinic in Davos, a town that acquired a name as a centre where TB
sufferers could convalesce.
In Conan Doyle's day, Davos was just beginning to earn its reputation as one
of Europe's classic winter sports regions, a natural progression from its
earlier fame as a health resort.
The walk is long and arduous but the scenery, wild flowers and plants are
sufficiently stirring to compensate. Occasionally we glimpsed giant ski-lift
pylons in the distance which seemed out of place without snow on the ground.
Conan Doyle made light of his epic tour in an article he wrote for Strand
Magazine 100 years ago. 'You adjust your body for a rapid slide', he wrote,
'but your 'ski' stick motionless and over you go upon your face. Or you stop
for an instant to tell a group how well you are getting on and they suddenly
find that their congratulations are addressed to the soles of your 'ski'
tied tightly round your neck]'
His ski tour de force was only one of many 'firsts' at Europe's highest town
(5,118ft) and Switzerland's largest ski resort. The first English ski club
was formed here in 1903 and the world's first tow bar was built by a young
German engineer, Gerhard Mueller, with the help of some old motor cycle
parts.
In 1931, the first funicular railway specifically for skiers was installed
up to the Weissfluhjoch and three years later Erich Constam installed the
world's first 'proper' drag lift. Some of Europe's first recreational skis
were tried out here, too.
A pair found their way to Davos from Norway and the village carpenter set
out to try to make duplicates.
Some of the local youths tried them out and struggled manfully to control
them, in spite of their vast length and lack of edges.
Although it is famous principally for its Parsenn mountain (skiing up to
9,300 ft), the long run down to Kublis and beyond (14 km) and the
exhilarating Derby run down to Kublis or Klosters, Davos has a wealth of
skiing spread in almost all directions. There are five main ski areas -
Parsenn, Jakobshorn, Rinerhorn, Schatzalp/Strelpass and Pischa, with almost
90 runs between them totalling 320 kilometres of pistes.
The Madrissa side of Klosters provides gentler skiing and an opportunity to
make moderately easy tours into Austria's Silvretta region.
The Parsenn/Weissfluh slopes provide the heart of the Davos skiing, linking
with Strela above Davos Platz and the Gotschna area above Klosters. There
are long, picturesque and not particularly difficult runs fanning out in
almost all directions.
Some of the north-facing runs down to Klosters are testing, particularly
Drostobel. And, of course, there is always the Wang. If it is open, ski it.
If it is closed, stay well away.
As for the tour to Arosa, it is doubtless easier, cheaper and safer in
summer than winter. After all, climbing on skins is much more difficult than
bounding up in decent walking boots.

skis in winter and on foot in summer as a guest of the Swiss Travel Service,

FT  02 JAN 93 / Sport: Year of the Olympic joke and Essex man - The cheats,
the cynics and the sporting heroes of 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPORTING year was dominated by Juan Antonio Samaranch's little joke. In
1992 he took the Olympics to his home town, Barcelona, in the high summer
weeks known locally as the canicula - the dog days. These are the hottest
and most humid time of the year. In 1992 they were hotter and more humid
than normal, the worst weather for athletes, the vast bulk staying in the
unairconditioned Olympic village. It was merely uncomfortable for everyone
else.
Yet everybody left praising the event. This was largely because of the
hosts' efforts. They missed no detail and spared no expense. But the
crowning moment of Samaranch's Olympic presidency has left his home city,
his home region and his home country with debts no-one can yet bring
themselves to count.
The run up to the Olympics was dominated by unpleasantness away from the
track about politics, drugs and money. Most worrying were the drug scandals
involving sprinters Katrina Krabbe of Germany and Butch Reynolds of the US
and attendant litigation.
Yet in Barcelona all these nasty odours evaporated. The biggest drugs bust
of the Games, three Britons caught by testing at home before the games, was
largely ignored by the world's press. The only way to catch steroid users is
with expensive and sophisticated out-of-competition testing. This is beyond
the means of most developing nations and beyond the will of some of the
richer ones, notably the US.
Without doubt medals at Barcelona were won by drug cheats. The choice lay
between suspecting everyone and giving competitors the benefit of the doubt.
Trust won the day.
The atmosphere at the games was improved by the hosts astonished pleasure at
their own success. Spain had won four gold medals in all the previous summer
Olympics. In Barcelona it won 13. One of the most memorable was Fermin
Cacho's charge through the field in the 1,500m gold accompanied by the
swelling roar of the 70,000 Montjuich crowd.
The fans in Spain were not simply partisan. They roared every jump by US
athletes Mike Powell and Carl Lewis in the long jump final. Lewis won by
3cm.
Sergey Bubka's fall from the pole vault firmament was greeted with
embarrassed murmuring as the spectators politely pretended they were
watching something else.
Paraskeve Patoulidou surged across the line in a tumble of bodies in the
women's 100m hurdles final and then did a slow, delicious double-take as the
replay showed that she had won. It was the first ever athletics gold by a
Greek woman. Before 1992 white South Africans had claimed all three
athletics medals won by African women. Now there were golds for Hassiba
Boulmerka of Algeria in the 800m and Deratu Tutu of Ethiopia, who beat Elana
Meyer of South Africa in an emotional 10,000m, and bronze for the Nigerians
in the 100m relay.
Quincy Watts and Kevin Young of the US, floated round the track as if borne
by angels as they broke records and won golds in the 400m and 400m hurdles
respectively.
Some were memorable in defeat: Derek Redmond of Great Britain limping round
the track on a torn hamstring, in the 400m heats. Brave 32-year-old Johnny
Gray of the US, went for broke in his last Olympics only to be caught at the
last by William Tanui and Nixon Kiptrotich at the end of an exhilarating
800m final. The warmth and generousity of his post-race press conference
provided a welcome vital sign for the Olympic ideal.
Britain's two triumphs on the track were achieved in overpowering style.
Linford Christie ran away from the field in the men's 100m and Sally Gunnell
did the same in the women's 400m hurdles.
Away from Montjuich, the games were dominated by the Dream Team, a group of
US professional basketball stars who were there for all the wrong reasons,
welcomed in the hope that some of the fame and wealth might rub off on their
rivals. Maybe it will. The Dreams worked as hard at PR as they did on the
court, won the gold at a stroll and allowed two of the games great stars,
Earvin Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, to take final bows of their careers on
the world's largest stage.
The British discovered cycling when Chris Boardman ripped to the 4,000m
pursuit gold medal on his high-tech Lotus bicycle. The cycle was largely the
work of Rudi Thomann, a French engineer: never mind, it still revived
Britain's dimming faith in its technological wizardry.
Technological superiority lay behind Nigel Mansell's Formula 1 world
championship. If Mansell had been with any other team his Williams car,
which possesses far more charisma than him, would probably have won anyway.
Mansell felt unappreciated and plans to race in the US. Frank Williams, the
team proprietor, sent him on his way with the words: 'He thinks he is a
superstar. In fact, he is just a lot richer and a bit quicker than he was
four years ago when he joined us.'
Mansell was one of a trio of dour, awkward, men who dominated British sport
in 1992. The second rather let his mask slip. Nick Faldo burst into tears
after winning his fifth major, the Open at Muirfield. 'I'm just an emotional
little petal,' he said.
The spiritual leader of this threesome is Graham Gooch, patron saint of
Essex men. Gooch led his county to the championship, again, took England to
the World Cup final. Gooch resisted stubbornly against Pakistan's pace pair
of Waqar Younis and Wazim Akram in the tests. But England lost a thrilling
series. Afterwards, Gooch dropped David Gower, hero of the last test and
embodiment of the English sporting ideal of diffident public school boy,
from the party to India. His place is taken by the archetypal pugnacious
state school lad: Mike Gatting.
Gooch knows when to grind and when to unfurl his undoubted flair. The same
could not always be said of England's other two national teams - although
both showed signs of a developing sense adventure. England's rugby union
team added a little flair to the physical grind on their way to another five
nations championship and then dispatched South Africa on their return to
Twickenham.
Meanwhile, Australia beat everyone in the southern hemisphere before popping
over to Ireland and Wales for yet another triumphant tour, entertaining
themselves with with a little sniping at England. They were popular tourists
with everyone except Will Carling, the England captain, and Neath rugby
club, whose allegedly below-the-belt tactics led Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer to
dub it 'the bag-snatching capital of Wales.'
England's increasingly neurotic soccer team trudged to the European
championships where it was the dullest and dourest of a collection of dull
and dour teams. The only sunshine came from Scotland, who had the courage to
play expansive soccer but lacked the nerve to score goals.
The final was a fairy tale of sorts. The Danes late replacements for
Yugoslavia, beat Germany, the world champions in a style more Brothers Grimm
than Hans Christian Andersen. The Germans tried to win with organisation and
work rate, which the Danes had by the bucket load, rather than imagination
and flair. Fittingly, the crucial goal was scored by Danish midfield clogger
John Jensen.
The grand old ladies of soccer, the English Football Association, fooled by
blandishments from 22 soccer chairmen, dropped its petticoats. The unwelcome
offspring was the new Premier League, child of greed. However, if Norwich
City, Blackburn Rovers or Ipswich Town break the long rule of the wealthy
big city teams and win the inaugural title, the whole sordid affair will
have had one good result.
The only beacon of hope in the European soccer year has been the Italian
league. AC Milan demonstrate that you can win playing stylishly and Paul
Gascoigne, who raises the England team above the cynically mundane, is
treated with more care than he could expect in his overworked home league.
With any luck the Italians will buy the Welsh teenage prodigy Ryan Giggs
before he is destroyed by too much overly-physical English soccer.
As the year ended the drug scandals re-emrged. In Reynolds' dispute with
Primo Nebiolo, Nabob of the International Amateur (sic) Athletic Federation,
an Ohio court awarded the runner Dollars 27.3m. Nebiolo refused to contest
the case, arguing that civil courts have no right to rule on its drug
suspensions. He has a point. There are many nations in which the courts
could not be relied on to find against national sporting heroes, regardless
of the merits of the case. But the Ohio court did not object to the
principle that the IAAF should ban athletes, it objected to the high-handed
way Nebiolo had dealt with the case. If 1992 has demonstrated one thing it
is that a spot of purse snatching concentrates administrators' minds. If the
US court forces the IAAF's corporate sponsors to hand over the Dollars
27.3m, the year's last laugh will be against Samaranch's most powerful
courtier, the unappetising Nebiolo.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Travel: St Lucia: a violet in the Jalousie rainforest -
Jalousie Plantation is the smartest, newest, hideaway Caribbean luxury
resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX snapshots from St Lucia:
First snap, 9.30am: I am sitting on the veranda of my cottage at Jalousie
Plantation, listening to the birds, listening for the rain, and watching the
rainforest stir and resettle. There are butterflies flickering. It is early
December.
Jalousie Plantation is the latest word in luxury hideaway Caribbean resorts,
so I am flicking through the PR bumf, comparing what it says with what I see
around me. For once, the PR hooligans and harridans have met their match.
They cannot be gainsayed. In the calm of this beautiful morning their
superlatives seem gnat-sized in comparison with the scene laid before me.
According to the bumf: 'Situated on 320 acres of a former sugar and copra
plantation, in its own private estate set against the waters of the
Caribbean Sea, Jalousie Plantation is a site spectacular, even for the
Caribbean.
'Framed between the symbols of St Lucia, the Petit Piton and Gros Piton
mountains, which rise 2,619ft and 2,461ft respectively, the creators of this
new resort have painstakingly disguised it to blend in with Mother Nature.'
That is all extremely true. To my left and right are Gros and Petit Piton -
dramatic volcanic upthrustings, arrowhead-shaped. When it rains, the pitons
shed instant cataracts, like a young bride's tears. Yesterday, a woman was
injured while climbing the Petit Piton. She should not have been on it.
Illegally, guides take tourists up for about Dollars 20. The woman had to be
rescued: soldiers, a helicopter, really quite a flap.
The sea is in front of me, lapping the beach at Jalousie Cove where some
fishermen are located. This is an all-inclusive resort. One price covers
everything: accommodation, meals, drinks, sports, spas, supervision of
children, airport transfers, taxes and service charges. Apparently, I can
ask one of these fishermen for the catch of the day and have it
charcoal-grilled at the Bayside Bar and Grill, one of the resort's four
restaurants, before my very eyes.
Behind me is a dense rainforest ridge from which the plantation and its
tropical flora cascade to the cove. Part of the estate is regarded as a bird
sanctuary, to help attract the green Jacquot parrot, St Lucia's national
bird, which is said to be endangered, no doubt due to foolishness.
Jalousie's efforts at plant and birdlife conservation have won the approval
of Dr Josephine Rickards, chairman of the St Lucia Naturalists' Society.
The rain has not come. I bin the PR bumf. Shall I swim in my private
plunge-pool or go in search of the elephant?
Second snap, 9.30pm. I am having dinner with Colin Tennant - Lord Glenconner
 -who is an investor in Jalousie, and Robert Stewart, general manager. Some
of the antiques in Jalousie's Great House have come from Glenconner's homes
in Mustique, Scotland and England. He lives in a house high above the cove,
at the foot of Gros Piton. The house is murder to get to though the view is
sensational. Glenconner is a scrupulously courteous man, and inexhaustibly
knowledgeable about the Windward Islands and their ways. He has lived in St
Lucia since 1979.
Between courses, I tell him about my theory that travel writing should be
judged not on what it includes but on what it leaves out.
'Such as?'
'Well, wodges of historical stuff chucked in as padding.'
'I see. Much of it is wrong, you know. Someone gets the history wrong and
then it is repeated, handed on down. I feel sorry for tourists, you know.
They don't see very much. All they see is an extremely small part of things
 -not how people live, how they really are.
'And inaccuracies abound. For example, all the guides and guidebooks say St
Lucia has a 'drive-in volcano,' but it is neither volcano nor drive-in. If
you ask me, the volcano was out here' - he gestures towards Jalousie cove -
'between the pitons. What the tourists are shown are merely sulphur springs
associated with volcanic activity. I could be wrong, however.'
'How about that parrot? Is it really endangered?'
'I don't believe it is. Someone I know sees one nearly every day.'
'And how about your elephant? Is she generally around?'
'Ah, Bupa the elephant. She's in the bush right now, but certainly she's
about. A very good elephant. She would answer my call from anywhere on the
plantation.' Bupa is a 16-year-old African elephant that Glenconner
purchased in Dublin and shipped to St Lucia. 'She's very kind at heart, and
very fond of pigs. She doesn't sleep at night. Do you know what she does?
She cracks open coconuts and puts them in a line for when the pigs wake up.'
Third snap, 10am the next day. I am pottering round the volcanic springs,
south of Soufriere: about an acre, grey and brown mudpools, a gentle hissing
of steam. Really rather tedious. An eruption is not predicted. After that I
drive into Soufriere, which is tatty and poor, but not without charm, and
demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of many old Caribbean towns to storms
and hurricanes. Some of Soufriere's shanties could be demolished with a
cough. The people are nice, though: as slim as sticks of sugar cane, and not
at all hustly.
Fourth snap, 12.45pm. I am riding with Glenconner, heading for his house
along a track of unbelievable ruggedness. He chatters on cheerfully. 'The
mangoes here are very fine, you know. I believe there must be 20 to 30
species, though it is almost impossible to find anything about them in
books. Do you see that one? That is mango morte. I tried it once. Its taste
is said to be reminiscent of human flesh. Rather a fine tree.'
Fifth snap, 4pm. I am back at Jalousie, sitting near the beach, pondering
the state of marriage, of which I have no experience. Was it diffidence, I
wonder, the curse of the English, that stopped me getting married, or am I
one of Nature's swingers, born to be single? What is prompting these musings
is the press of honeymooning flesh parked by the swimming pool: bronzed pecs
and breasts basted and sauteing.
Perhaps, it occurs to me, a marriage inaugurated and consummated at Jalousie
would not die with a whimper. I snatch up a description of Jalousie's rates
and packages. The Jalousie wedding, it says, is something never to be
forgotten.
It says that couples that get hitched at Jalousie will receive, at no extra
charge, 'upgraded accommodations (depending on availability), a wedding
ceremony (with surcharge for the attendance of officials, the rate depending
on denomination), bouquet, dress (an extravagant wedding gown, created in St
Lucia, is available, free of charge), decorated wedding site, cake
(three-tier), cocktail reception with hors d'oeuvres, gala dinner and a
bottle of French champagne. Other services available for a surcharge
include: professional photographer, video services and special dance band.'
The Jalousie honeymoon also sounds auspicious: 'At the dawn of each day, the
couple can request a special breakfast in the privacy of their own patio by
the plunge-pool. A candlit dinner for two on the night of their choice also
awaits, as does a private day on a deserted beach with an exotic picnic
lunch . . . Each night, as the sun sets into the Caribbean, a personalised
Good Night Treat will be in the room.' Again, there is no extra charge for
the 'honeymoon programme.'
I wander up to the reception desk. I am more than half tempted to ask to
view the indigenous wedding gown, to see if it would fit anyone I know. But
my courage evaporates; diffidence reasserts itself. They would think me
frivolous, my inquiry half-baked. I shrink away silently, a violet in the
rainforest.
Sixth snap, 5.50pm. The sun, an orb of palest gold, is propped on the
horizon, about to disappear. The sea is pewter coloured. An hour ago I
scrambled through the bush in search of Bupa the elephant. An extremely kind
elephant. A lover of bananas. Remarkably long eyelashes. No sign of her
pigs.
It has been a perfect day. I realise that I am sitting in the best spot in
the best location of what many people regard - scenerywise, peoplewise and
otherwise - as the Caribbean's most attractive island. I am reading Travels
With My Trombone: A Caribbean Journey, by Englishman Henry Shukman, who
tells of travelling by cement boat from Dominica to Trinidad. As they pass
an ink stain above the horizon which he guesses is Martinique, a crewman
approaches him and asks: 'Checking de island? That Mattnick.'
'Mattnick?'
'Yeah. Martinique. Dey is French.' The crewman rests his elbows alongside
Shukman's. 'I don't like Martinique,' he says.
'Why not?' asks Shukman.
'De people is very stick to deyself.'
'Which island do you like?'
'Saint Lucy,' replies the crewman. 'Saint Lucy sweet, man.'
Michael Thompson-Noel was a guest of Jalousie Plantation, and travelled c/o
British Airways. Until April 11, rates at Jalousie vary from Dollars
240-Dollars 460 per person per night in a double suite or cottage; after
that: Dollars 215-Dollars 375 per person per night per couple. Children
under 12 are free if staying with parents. Children 12-15: add Dollars 70
per night per child.
Jalousie is managed by Premier Resorts &amp; Hotels of Miami, reservations (US
and Canada): (800)-877-3643; all other countries: (305)-856-5405. In the UK,
Premier's agent is Supereps, tel: 071-242-9964. The resort is also listed
with various UK tour operators, including Caribbean Connection, Elite
Vacations, Harlequin Holidays and Happiness Islands. Jalousie Plantation's
address: PO Box 251, Soufriere, St Lucia, West Indies, tel: (809)-459-7666.
Jalousie is an hour by road or boat from Hewanorra airport; apart from BA,
Hewanorra is served by Air Canada, American Airlines, BWIA and LIAT. There
is a smaller airport, Vigie, at the other end of the island, near the
capital, Castries. The temperature on St Lucia is said to vary only between
77oF-82oF year-round.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A storm in an Earl Grey teacup - Giles
MacDonogh turns to the tea leaves for new year inspiration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN IN our democratic age the nobility has a way of selling things. It was
not so long ago that a biscuit company engaged the services of a ducal pair
to sell its products: 'Mmmm, orangey,' said her grace, as she nibbled away.
The use of noblemen and women in television advertisements panders to
snobbery, but the attachment of aristocratic names to dishes has a more
interesting history: partly based on the tradition of patronage and, in
France at least, on a certain notion of gastro-erotica at the time of Louis
XV.
It was rarely, if ever, noblewomen themselves who were behind the dishes
which bore their names. The Marechale de Soubise never sullied her delicate
hands with onions any more than the Duchesse de Mailly spent her time
experimenting with baby-rabbit fillets. These dishes were the inventions of
cordons bleus. Their purpose was to tickle the palate of His Gourmand
Majesty. Any female courtier who came up with something special might well
be considered next in line for the royal bed.
As we all know, the British do not have sex. There is nothing in the least
bit sexy about a sandwich, even if the noble earl of that name did lay down
the law as to how it should be made. Boeuf Wellington might have a more
aphrodisiac effect, but the origins of the dish almost certainly predate the
Iron Duke's time. When we come down to it, most people in Britain would
rather have a cup of tea.
As it so happens, our most famous tea also bears a noble patent; that of the
second Earl Grey. This particular Earl Grey was a busy man, a Whig grandee
who introduced the Great Reform Bill in 1832 which began the process which
ended with the democratisation of these islands. Did he then have the time
to nip off to China in order to put together the blend of black teas and oil
of bergamot which bears his name?
Tony Wild, of the East India Company, says definitely not. He and his
researcher, Robert Baldwin, have been through the Grey papers at Durham
University and found no evidence that the noble lord had anything to do with
the Earl Grey blend.
In a lecture delivered to an invited audience at the Victoria &amp; Albert
Museum last autumn, Wild poured scorn on the many legends which have grown
up surrounding the tea: there was no truth in the story of Grey even
visiting China, let alone saving the life of a Mandarin who, in gratitude,
taught him his recipe for tea with the oils of bitter oranges.
Wild advances his own theory as to the origins of the blend. He traces the
tea back to the circle of Sir Joseph Banks, the natural scientist, who
edited the official account of the McCartney Mission to China in 1792.
The account contains a good deal of information on tea growing including the
promiscuous planting of tea bushes and orange trees. Banks was also known to
be passionate about tea.
One of Banks' friends was Sir George Staunton, whose father, another George,
was part of the McCartney mission. Wild has uncovered some circumstantial
evidence to show that Staunton might have dreamed up the famous blend, and
has consequently marketed a new Earl Grey tea called 'East India Company
Staunton Earl Grey'.
Rather more likely, however, is that Jacksons of Piccadilly simply asked the
famous reformist Earl Grey for permission to attach his name to their new
creation. Grey was after all, something a hero for the newly enfranchised
middle classes: the tea was bound to sell.
Wild believes he may have caused a storm in a teacup by these revelations
but the sixth Earl Grey seemed fairly apathetic when I spoke to him: 'He's
just trying to launch his new brand, and good luck to him,' he said
charitably.
The noble lord, who appends his signature to the Twinings brand, admits that
the second earl - to whom he refers quaintly as his 'predecessor'  - 'never
went to China' thereby refuting the version of the story written on the
Twinings' packet.
Lord Grey seemed most struck by Wild's claim that he was earning a fortune
from Twinings for 'legitimising' the brand. As for the rest he simply was
not going to rise to the bait: squabbles of this sort are simply too infra
dig.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Cookery: Ginger up your new year cake - Philippa Davenport
guards against bad luck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GINGER IS said to bring good luck. Will the eating of it early in 1993
lessen the chances of another annus horribilis, I wonder? In the hope that
it will, I am planning to eat a good deal of it on Twelfth Night. This sheds
new light on the notion of going gingerly into the new year.
The easiest way to guard against bad luck might simply be to crack open a
porcelain jar of stem ginger in syrup and treat it like a fondue: give
everyone a fork for spearing the nuggets and offer bowls of whipped cream or
creme fraiche for dipping, and squares of best bitter chocolate (Black &amp;
Green's) to nibble on the side.
I also like the idea of making an Italianate ginger trifle - using panettone
instead of sponge cake, Marsala as the booze, and a mixture of sliced stem
ginger, segments of clementine and well toasted hazelnuts under billowing
layers of custard and cream.
Already a festive favourite in this household is a ginger cake made along
lines traditional in Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire.
In those areas celebratory dishes are often laced with such ingredients as
rum, molasses and all manner of spices. These recipes are a link to the
flourishing trade in times past with the West Indies and Far East, and they
serve as a reminder that Whitehaven was once one of the most important ports
in Britain.
Old cake recipes like the one which follows are often known as pepper cake,
rather than ginger cake. This may be because freshly ground black
peppercorns are sometimes included for extra aroma and heat.
It is more likely, I think, to stem from the more frequent inclusion of
Jamaica pepper. This is the small brown berry native to Jamaica, a little
larger than than a peppercorn and not actually a true pepper at all, better
known today as allspice.
Its name derives from the fact that it is thought to have something in its
aroma of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg combined.
A cake like this will only taste as good as it should if allowed to mature
for four or five days between baking and eating. So there is no time to
lose. Make it today and serve it on Twelfth Night for a lucky 1993.
Serve it for tea, sliced just as it is or spread with butter. Or, for a
delicious pudding, top fingers of the cake with whipped cream or creme
fraiche and serve them alongside a dish of Cox's Orange Pippins or Kidd's
Orange Reds cut into crescent moon slices and fried in butter until gilded
and sizzling hot.
YORKSHIRE PEPPER CAKE Heat the oven to 325oF (170oC) gas mark 3. Butter a
deep 8 in sq cake tin and line the base with buttered greaseproof paper.
Stir together in a large bowl 6 oz plain flour, 2 oz rye flour (or wholemeal
in the absence of rye flour), 1 1/2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda, 1
tablespoon ground ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon
ground Jamaican pepper (in other words allspice) and  1/2 teaspoon freshly
ground black pepper. Make a well in the centre.
Mix together in a separate small bowl some stem ginger chopped into small
pieces and some sultanas or dates, 7 oz in all, say 4 oz ginger and 3 oz
sultanas or dates. Sultanas add juicy sweetness. Dates, which should be
stoned and chopped, give the cake a delicious fudgey quality.
Dice 4 oz butter into a saucepan. Drizzle over the fat 6 oz each strong dark
honey, such as heather, and black treacle. (If preferred the 12 oz of
sweetener can be made up of equal weights of unrefined brown sugar, honey
and black treacle.)
Warm gently over low heat, stirring now and again, until the butter has
melted and the ingredients are blended.
Set the pan aside to cool the contents a little while you break 2 eggs into
a cup and mix into them with a fork 2 tablespoons milk.
Then pour the warm butter and treacle mixture into the bowl of spiced flour,
and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth and glossy, gradually adding in
the beaten eggs.
Stir in the chopped ginger and sultanas or dates. Turn the mixture into the
prepared tin and bake for about 70 minutes.
Cool on a rack and wrap tightly as soon as cold in fresh greaseproof paper
and foil. Store for four days before eating.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The empire cooks back - The revival of a
cuisine fit for sultans
</HEADLINE>

   THE Ottoman Empire is being revived
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
in the kitchens of Istanbul. Old cookery books are being scoured in search
of lost kebabs and forgotten pilaffs. Restaurants are opening dedicated to
the cuisine of the palace and the pashas rather than the food of the bazaar.
Even for the most jaded palate, Ottoman food is an adventure. Among its
delights are sour dried plum, tripe soup with garlic vinegar and chicken
pudding.
In a domed and arcaded courtyard beside the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by
Suleyman the Magnificent in the 1550s, the Sultan established a soup-kitchen
where the poor and the pious were fed at his expense. Last year a superb
Ottoman restaurant, called Daruzziyafe, opened in the courtyard and the
adjacent halls.
Among the best dishes in the long and elaborate menu are red lentil soup
(Suleymaniye Corbasi), artichokes stuffed with minced meat, a special kofte
(minced meat) of lamb, chicken and pistachios wrapped in wafer-pastry
(Yufkali Daruzziyafe koftesi) and asure, a Ramadan pudding made of nuts and
fruit. Since the restaurant site is still part of the Suleymaniye Mosque
complex, alcohol is not served. Who needs wine, when sherbet of grapes,
strawberries or the hips of wild roses are automatically brought to your
table?
In a traditional part of Istanbul, south of the Golden Horn, the Daruzziyafe
has a faintly austere atmosphere: it is especially popular during Ramadan,
with the congregation of the Suleymaniye mosque. The Tugra restaurant, on
the other hand, is in a different world: a 19th century sultan's palace on
the banks of the Bosphorus, which has been transformed, in the last two
years, into the Ciragan Palace Hotel, the most sumptuous in Istanbul. Vedat
Basaran, the restaurant manager, trained in London, and spent two years
researching Ottoman food, teaching himself Ottoman script in order to read
old cookery books. The son of a palace chef, Karamehmet Zennegolu, provided
him with another link with the lost world of Ottoman food.
Ottoman cuisine, a mixture of Central Asian, Middle Eastern and
Mediterranean influences, has always been sophisticated, some dishes
requiring days of preparation.
In every self-respecting pasha's household two sets of vegetables were
served at meals: cold vegetables in oil and hot vegetables cooked in butter.
In the Tugra restaurant, lavishly redecorated in the style called 'Saudi
Hollywood', the food is prepared with a devotion to detail worthy of the
palace kitchens.
Fish is grilled on wood cut from a fresh bay tree, so that the heat blends
the flavours. Quails are cooked inside giant aubergines, and lamb is grilled
with peeled root of aubergine, in order to absorb the flavour of what
Ottoman cooks considered the 'king of vegetables'.
Among the puddings Hunkar muhallebi, milk pudding with wild strawberries and
pistachios, is delicious. I hope the famous Ottoman pudding called tavuk
gogsu, available in many local shops, will soon appear on the menu. Made of
chicken meat beaten to a smooth pulp and then cooked with milk, sugar and
cinnamon, it was frequently served to foreign guests:
In the late 19th century the deposed Sultan Murat V was immured in Ciragan
Palace for 28 years, by his brother Sultan Abdulhamit II. The best French
brandy and champagne helped console him for the loss of his throne and his
freedom.
Guests in the Tugra restaurant can follow the Sultan's example, but they
should try some Turkish wine. The Kavaklidere company produces good
products.
In spite of the grandeur of these two restaurants, and the excellent
service, on some evenings, overwhelmed by crowds, the food can be bland.
Just as enjoyable was the Asithane Restaurant, in a simple district of
Istanbul beside the Byzantine splendour of the Kariye Camii. The chef Rasit
Ozdemir is from Bolu, a province famed for its cooks. His fava (broad bean
paste) and Visneli Ekmek Tatlisi, bread soaked in sour cherry syrup - a
distant Turkish cousin of summer pudding - were especially good. Pilaff or
pilav is a speciality of Turkish cooking: the crack troops of the Ottoman
army, the Janissaries, loved it so much that they used rice cauldrons on
regimental banners. In all three restaurants the pilaff was excellent and
the Asithane restaurant served a variety new to me and my Turkish hosts:
Kadirga Pilav (rice with almonds, pistachios and herbs served au gratin).
All three restaurants provide a reinterpretation, rather than a revival, of
Ottoman cuisine. The energetic young manager of Daruzziyafe, Alper Okutan,
admits: 'Sometimes you have to modernise something. You don't have the exact
material.'
Vedat Basaran is determined to introduce what he calls 'a new concept of
Ottoman cuisine', adapted to the demands of the modern restaurant, and the
need for attractive presentation on the plate. He says: 'We are trying to
bring out the old recipes according to new methods.' Instead of whole
chickens, stuffed with pistachios, oriental rice and spinach, visitors to
the Tugra restaurant are served stuffed breast of chicken, which used to be
served to Ottoman dignitaries. The deadening influence of nouvelle cuisine
is apparent: a few mixed vegetables on the side of a plate often replace the
traditional platefuls of the same vegetable. The iceberg lettuce has ousted
local varieties. Some members of the Turkish Food Lovers' Association say
that they are happiest in the simple restaurants behind the fish market in
Beyoglu.
The revival of Ottoman cuisine is part of the wider reappraisal of their
position in the world, being undertaken by a minority among the new
generation of educated Turks. They combine knowledge of the latest
management techniques with a desire to rediscover traditions which they have
lostsince Kemal Ataturk replaced the Ottoman Empire with the Turkish
Republic in 1923.
All three restaurants had musicians singing or playing soothing traditional
Turkish music.
Since the Ottoman Empire was a multinational state, this new interest in the
past is far from nationalistic. Dishes with Azeri, Albanian and even Greek
names are on the menu.
Vedat Basaran, originally from Yugoslavia, says: 'Ottoman was not only
Turkish, it was part of a huge food culture.' Older generations, brought up
in veneration of the Ataturkist republic, are bewildered. Information:

FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The art of a friendly welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST restaurant I rang, where dinner would have cost Pounds 50 a head,
did not seem concerned that it could not give me a table. There was no offer
of an alternative time nor was my name and number taken in case of a
cancellation. It showed little desire to welcome me.
The second restaurant could not have been more different - even though it
was part of the same group, Forte. The receptionist explained the new menu;
told me about its jazz trio and made me feel most welcome. Dinner was very
reasonably priced.
Efficient but friendly receptionists are invaluable to any restaurant
because first impressions are so crucial. Receptionists are also a
restaurant's last line of defence. Any criticism of the food or service
which the customer felt too intimidated to pass to the manager often comes
out as the coats go on. A receptionist worth her salt should be able to
overhear and make some attempt at salvaging the situation.
Christmas and new year test a receptionist's talents to the full. Perhaps he
or she will be grappling with 20 similar overcoats and black umbrellas from
a group arriving for an office party. Maybe the receptionist will be
propping up his or her eyelids until the early hours when the last guest
leaves. Often a receptionist will be dealing with clients who are slightly
the worse for drink.
But there will be financial compensations. Receptionists are paid a bread
and butter rate by the restaurant, approximately Pounds 25 for a shift that
may last from 5.30pm until 1.30 am. The cream is the tips. Until the Inland
Revenue and the recession intervened, tips could amount to Pounds 40 to
Pounds 50 in cash on a busy night. Today, the receptionist will invariably
be last in the gratuities queue as customers curb spending and tips are
pooled with the rest of the staff and taxed.
So what is the appeal of the job? For the answer I turned to Sian Cox, a
woman who was the finest receptionist I employed in my previous career as a
restaurateur. On paper, she was vastly over-qualified - an attractive
fulltime schoolteacher and a mother of three. But she had the two basic
qualities any good receptionist needs - old-fashioned good manners and a
genuine interest in the public. Sian Cox modestly described herself as 'a
people junkie.'
Armed with Sian's qualities a good receptionist should be able to cope with
the other demands of the job: to put themselves out, whatever the time; to
be able to prioritise when dealing with the arrival and departure of guests;
answering the incessant call of the telephone and handling irate taxi
drivers who have been given only a client's first name.
The final attraction of the job for Sian was that it gave her the
opportunity for nights out in a completely different environment. Made-up
and smartly dressed, she would leave her children with her husband and join
a bustling, adult world which was a complete contrast to her day in the
classroom. The receptionist's world may not be as intellectually stimulating
as a teacher's but it can be more financially rewarding.
The most attractive bonus for any receptionist must, however, be that of
Kurt Wachtveitl's, general manager of the Oriental, in Bangkok. Every New
Year's Eve he opens itsfamous Bamboo Bar and closes when the last guest has
left at about 6am. Then, armed with a large Bloody Mary, he heads off for a
peaceful journeyalong the klongs (canals) of Bangkok.
Sadly,this is a perk not available to even the finest restaurant
receptionist in London.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Motoring: Bumper forecast for new models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS I peered into the bottom of the Waterford tumbler that serves as my
crystal ball, what did I see for motoring in 1993? A brighter prospect than
last year's - and I do not think my optimism had anything to do with a
warming dram of Islay malt.
It is going to be a bumper year for new models. Without wishing to sound
like a government minister trying to keep up his spirits, car registrations
did soar unexpectedly in December and the flood of new models is bound to
stir the market.
Among the most important of 1993's new model crop is Ford's front-wheel
driven Sierra replacement, the Mondeo. It takes its bow at the Geneva show
in March. So will a deadly rival, the Citroen Xantia.
A month before that, the Peugeot 309's replacement will have been unveiled
at the Amsterdam show.
Earlier still, British buyers of small cars and multi-purpose vehicles
(MPVs) will have been tempted into showrooms by two new Nissans. They are
the British-built Micra (European Car of the Year 1993) and the
Spanish-built, though in many cases British engined, Serena.
I used both cars as transport over the holiday and was impressed; more of
them in this column soon. Prices will be announced next week.
The Toyota Carina E saloons and hatchbacks rolling off the assembly line at
Burnaston, Derbyshire, are powered by engines made in north Wales. The
Carina E has been criticised (not by me) for offering so much silence,
efficiency and promised reliability as to be tedious. That kind of boredom
appeals to real-world buyers, if not to writers in magazines which persist
in treating everyday motoring as a sporting activity.
Mercedes-Benz sales, higher in the UK last year than in 1991, will be
boosted by the arrival of the new 190 (another Geneva debutante). Quality
car sales have been generally healthy in Britain in recent months. There may
be fields full of unsold Mercedes in Germany, where the recession is only
just staring to bite, but there are none in the UK.
Honda's British-made Accord (and Montego-replacing Rover 600 version) will
sharpen competition in the middle-management business car sector. Fiat, a
marque I suspect will at last be coming in from the cold in Britain in 1993,
will put its dinkily attractive Cinquecento before buyers here in late
spring. Towards the end of the year, the replacement for the best-selling
Uno is expected.
Hot hatchback sales will be further depressed in 1993 as they become harder
and yet more costly to insure. Frustrated hot hatch drivers will continue to
switch to recreational four-wheel drives. There will be a major upset in
this recession-resistant sector with the arrival of Chrysler Jeeps later
this month.
Jeep Wranglers will appeal to the young; family men will go for the
Cherokee. This very civilised five-seat estate car takes to the road like a
Volvo, and goes across country like, well, a real Jeep. At a little more
than Pounds 20,000 with a four-litre, six-cylinder engine, automatic
transmission, leather seats, wood veneer trim, air conditioning, ABS brakes,
cruise control, power windows and six-speaker stereo, it makes nearly all
its competitors look expensive.
Diesels made up 16 per cent of registrations at the end of 1992 compared
with only one per cent a decade ago. (Modesty alone prevents my saying I
told you so.) Their popularity will grow and by the end of 1993, one new
British-registered car in five could well be a diesel.
Seeing no reason to break the habit of 14 years, I am driving into 1993 in
yet another diesel - a Citroen XMtd estate with automatic transmission. I
shall shortly be reporting on our first few thousand miles together.
Headlines this year will continue to blame multiple motorway pile-ups on
fog, frost and snow instead of on mindless and inattentive drivers failing
to maintain sensible speeds and observe proper braking distances.
Footpaths will be used as parking places by car and commercial vehicle
drivers, too idle to walk a few yards and who do not give a damn for the
safety and convenience of pedestrians, especially the old and the blind.
Tougher MoT tests should result in old, rusting heaps going to the knackers
yard where they belong. But with an estimated up to 10 per cent of all cars
being neither taxed nor insured, I am not optimistic that all unsafe old
bangers will be caught in the MoT net.

FT  02 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Fantasy world of a rebel designer - Koji
Tatsuno turns ordinary clothes into specialities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Koji Tatsuno was at school in Tokyo, he wore the same military uniform
as every other Japanese schoolboy. From the outside, he looked like his
classmates, but inside he had embroidered a red dragon on his jacket lining.
Tatsuno now has a broader canvas to draw on. The boy who customised his
school uniform in 1970s' Tokyo has become one of the most inventive fashion
designers in Europe today.
Tatsuno treats fashion as fantasy. His clothes are extraordinary creations
of fabulous fabrics, pleated silk jackets and waistcoats in Victorian-style
tapestry, finished with shell buttons or tiny pearls.
This winter's collection oozes opulence with silks and velvets. For summer,
he has used materials on hand - pieces of cloth left over in his studio,
leaves from the garden, even strips of salmon skin.
The effect is exquisite and individualistic. The designs are not conceived
as part of co-ordinated collections, but as particular pieces to be worn by
different people. The cast list of his customers - from ascetic art
collector Doris Saatchi to entertainer Diana Ross - reflects this. But all
his clients will wear, and re-wear, their Tatsuno for years.
'If something is made properly, it should age,' he says. 'I would hate to
think of people buying my clothes to wear them for a year and to throw them
away. Clothes have lives of their own. The shape of a garment and the feel
of the fabric change. Anything I make today should look completely different
in five or six years time.'
Tatsuno, 29, is a slight man with long, silky black hair, wearing not one,
but two, polo-necks and a chunky corduroy jacket against the chill of a
drizzly London day. He has lived in London since 1982 when he arrived from
Japan, with no money and no English.
Born in a Tokyo suburb, his father was an air traffic controller and his
mother left home when he was very young. His father remarried and he did not
get on with his stepmother. At 14 he ran away to fend for himself in Tokyo.
Education is everything in Japan. A high school drop-out is an illiterate
outcast with little or no hope of finding work. Tatsuno scraped along until
he was sent to London to buy English antiques for a Tokyo dealer. The dust
and dirt disgusted him after the spruce streets of Japan. With little money,
he made his own clothes from fabrics he found at antique markets.
His break came when a buyer from Browns, the designer store, stopped him on
the street and asked about the shirt he was wearing. Tatsuno started selling
to Browns, beginning his own business, Culture Shock, which enjoyed a cult
following before collapsing in 1986 with cashflow problems.
A shop on Mount Street followed, backed by Yohji Yamamoto, the Tokyo
designer. Finally, in 1990, Tatsuno opened his own label.
He now operates from a shambolic studio on All Saints Road, in the heart of
Notting Hill. Tatsuno and his partner, Yvonne Sporre, do all the designs and
fabric development with a team of five. He has no formal training and
designs by instinct - 'I try not to think too much about it beforehand' -
draping his fabrics around mannequins.
The core of his collection is still couture, but he has also introduced
ready-to-wear made by an Italian sub-contractor. Ready-to-wear is a
watered-down version of the couture and is also far cheaper. Joseph in
London sells his ready-to-wear jackets for Pounds 350 and the couture
versions for Pounds 2,000.
He shows at the Paris pret-a-porter, which has given him an entree into the
international marketplace. His clothes are sold by Barney's in New York and
L'Eclaireur in Paris, where he also has his own shop in Saint Germain. But
his business is still small by international standards, with Pounds 1m
turnover this year.
Tatsuno plans to stay in London. 'I am a private person, still very Japanese
in some ways. I always keep part of myself hidden and it is easier to do
that here. In Milan or Paris, I would be sucked into the fashion system.'
So far the system has been good to him. Christian Lacroix and Azzedine
Alaia, the Paris designers, both encouraged him when he was launching his
label.
Didier Grumbach, chairman of Thierry Mugler, has given financial advice.
Grumbach's sister, Sylvie, now helps Tatsuno to organise his Paris shows,
just as she has helped Vivienne Westwood.
Tatsuno finds affinity with traditional Japanese aesthetics. 'There is a
simplicity and sense of balance that is very close to my vision. As an
outsider, I now see aspects of Japan that I did not appreciate before.' He
also shares the Japanese obsession for exploring the extraordinary side of
ordinary objects.
'I try to recognise ordinary things that can be turned into something
special.' Just as a simple stone is treated as an object of beauty in a
formal Zen garden, so Tatsuno makes a stunning silver tunic from 3,000
safety pins or sews strips of salmon skin on to his jackets.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Gardening: Coping with that seven-year itch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YEAR is a gardener's time for plans, reflections and memories. My plans
are obvious: do better; kill more weeds; spray earlier against black spot
and replant that supreme luxury, a wide, newly-manured border, emptied of
its previous jungle and creeping buttercups.
It looks as though single white Japanese anemones will have a large part to
play. They have been one of my plants of 1992, refuting the notion that they
prefer a dry year in dry soil. They will grow almost anywhere, but sometimes
they need a few years to establish themselves. During the 1990s, they will
have their chance to spread beneath a background of holly and a light canopy
of sycamores on the problematic fringes of my garden.
As for reflections, mine run in a particular direction. I keep thinking of
the principle which we all cite, but never fully obey: whenever you start a
new garden or a new design, plant the permanencies and big features first.
Time races by, until the seven-year wait for the first flowers on a Winter
Sweet or the white buds on a Magnolia Grandiflora seem like a tiny
interruption in the long road of a gardener's lifetime.
But whatever your time of life, the principle still applies. Think long term
and do not make the inevitable mistake of being half-hearted. I never
succeed in thinking out the long-lasting framework for an entire garden as a
first move and I am always diverted in places by an anxious wish for
immediate colour.
Although seven years seem an eternity when we first set out, ignore the
prospect and always choose the best for the future, a Magnolia Wilsonii, not
a Ribes, a hedge of clipped box rather than laurel. Always begin by planting
as many of the trees, large shrubs and hedges as you can.
As for the memories, they are less grandiose - 1992 turned out to be a
remarkable year. The spring was very dry and early and, by mid-June, it
seemed that everything in the garden would be over at once. After a mad
acceleration of the season, it began to rain, gaining momentum in July and
starting a welcome overture which has led up to the recent torrential
winter, unparalleled in my memory. At the same time, the air remained
unusually mild, giving us a vintage year for winter jasmine, magnolias and
winter-flowering cherry, until these recent frosts.
If I could plant only one tree for the longer term, it would still be a
winter cherry, of which the best form is the best-known, Prunus Subhirtella
Autumnalis. Between the early drought and the later floods, evergreens and
trees grew heroically. In the recent dry summers, survivors have been
putting down deep roots: this year, they confirmed the old wisdom, that
plants puzzle beginners by growing downwards for the first two or three
years and then race upwards thereafter. Never single out a shrub as a slow
performer on the sole evidence of early height.
In 1992, young yews, box and the admirable evergreen Osmanthus started to
grow rapidly upwards, after four years of sending deep roots down for water.
As a postscript, berries then appeared by the thousand on all sorts of
trees, making one of the best autumns for fruiting in my memory.
Since September, it has been the year of the Sorbus and I doubt if the Far
Eastern forms have ever been finer in Britain. Readers with Plantfinders
might share my enthusiasm for Adenophora Tashiroi, which comes from Japan
and covers itself in pale grey-blue flowers like small lampshades. It is
only a foot-high when in flower and, despite the books, appears to be
completely happy in full sun and a stony soil.
Beside it, I had a group of the various Parahebes in white and pale
milk-blue flowers. Again, these small evergreen shrubs make marvellous
edging for any low border and seem to flower throughout the summer. The
frost has not hurt them and I cannot imagine why gardeners grow them so
seldom.
Before the black spot, roses had an admirable fling in that extraordinary
June where everything was running at least two weeks early. I have started
to notice the qualities of some of the more delicate roses which were bred
in the early 1950s and are now beginning to seem old-fashioned: I strongly
recommend a quiet evening's research in Peter Beales' admirable reference
book Classic Roses, in which he does proper justice to forgotten roses, bred
in this era and kept in the trade by his nursery list, and often by no
other.
Elsewhere, many climbers were magnificent, although they flowered absurdly
early. For the first time, maturity showed me the full loveliness of
climbing Madame Paul Lede. It flowers only once, but the huge double heads
are a unique shade of dusky apricot pink, like the silk of a fine Edwardian
dress.
My most lasting memory is not a rose nor, indeed, a flower of any kind:
rather, 1992 was the Year of the Slug. In the wet weather, these non-human
companions became fat, bloated and abominably slimy. They played hell with
the hostas, but I am also pleased to be armed with an excellent modern
antidote. Called Growing Success, it is pet-friendly, plant-friendly and
slug-hostile. Slugs, I suppose, cannot help it, but they do have atrocious
appetites: Growing Success removes them by the dozen, efficiently, cleanly
and as victors can always afford to be magnanimous, I hope that the dozens
who died in 1992 died, in their non-linguistic world, without any real pain.

SHOPPING in the sales can be exhausting as you lug heavy carrier bags from
one overheated store to another. Desperate for something to eat and drink,
you end up in the basement of a large department store, eating under-cooked
and overpriced microwaved jacket potatoes. But you do not have to suffer:
here are some suggestions on where to find the best snacks.
In Oxford Street, the best in-store cafeterias are Selfridges and John
Lewis's The Place to Eat. But it is often quicker and more pleasant to step
outside. James Street, just north of Selfridges and round the corner from
Nicole Farhi and Buckle My Shoe in St Christopher's Place has several cafes,
including Cafe Rouge and Cafe Creperie.
Five minutes' walk north of Selfridges is Maison Sagne, 105 Marylebone High
Street. This is an old-fashioned, continental patisserie and is ideal for a
late breakfast of strong, coffee and brioche, croissant, a fruit tart baked
downstairs, or lunchtime omelette. A pot of filter coffee is Pounds 1.25, a
croissant Pounds 1.10. It is open 9am to 5pm weekdays and to 1pm on
Saturday.
Close to the Loewe end of Bond Street is the Granary Restaurant, 39
Albermarle Street. If you are hungry this is the place to go, either for a
huge salad, hot dishes with imaginatively cooked vegetables or old-fashioned
puddings. Avocado stuffed with spinach and cheese or paella with chicken and
mushrooms is Pounds 6.90. Staff are helpful, the self-service queue is short
and children are welcome. A meal for one, with a glass of wine, desert and
coffee is Pounds 11-Pounds 12. Open from 11.30 am to around 8pm on weekdays;
Saturday to 4.30pm.
On the edge of Knightsbridge is The Conservatory in the Lanesborough Hotel
on Hyde Park Corner. It is not cheap but is worth a visit if just to see the
lavish neo-Gothic design. The hotel staff are friendly, courteous and
helpful and unsnooty. A large cup of cappuccino is Pounds 2.50; Caesar salad
with is duckling Pounds 7.50. From 3-6 pm a pianist accompanies afternoon
tea; scones, crumpets and clotted cream Pounds 5.00; full afternoon tea
Pounds 13.50. It is open from 7am to 12 pm.
A short walk away in Harvey Nicholls' basement is Joe's restaurant bar which
does a tasty selection of light meals. The decor is black and grey, the
clientele trendy, but less so than in Joe's on Draycott Avenue. Service is
quick. The mushroom soup is good but is almost the cheapest item on the menu
at Pounds 3.95. The sultana bread, provided free, is excellent and makes up
for the Pounds 1 cover charge levied during lunch.
Filling club sandwiches are Pounds 7.50; appetising salads start from Pounds
7.50. The restaurant is open for lunch noon Monday to Saturday (11am to
3.30pm Sunday) and dinner from 7pm, Monday to Saturday.
Emporio Armani Express, 191 Brompton Road, does a tasty crostini - toasted
bread with chicken livers, tomato and mozzarella, Parma ham and artichoke
for Pounds 4. Cappuccino is good and creamy, but at Pounds 2 a cup it should
be. Lunch includes Italian dishes and salads. Main dishes are Pounds 8 -
Pounds 10.00. There are interestingly dressed people to stare at if you are
eating alone. Open 10.00 am to 5.30 pm; lunch from 12-3.30.
There is no shortage of choice in the Brompton Cross area. Near Beauchamp
Place, Patisserie Valerie, 215 Brompton Road, offers a good breakfast until
11.30. At lunchtime, there are more substantial dishes, such as croque
monsieur for Pounds 2.80, but the pastries and deserts should not be missed.
Tarte aux pommes is Pounds 1.50; good capuccino Pounds 1.20. The tables at
the back get busy but there is usually room at the counter. Service is quick
and efficient. It is open 7.30am to 7pm Monday to Friday; to 7pm on Saturday
and 9am to 6pm on Sunday.
A favourite among shoppers is La Brasserie, 272 Brompton Road. Hot food is
served all day including croque monsieur Pounds 2.50, spinach salad with
feta cheese Pounds 4.80. A small pot of coffee for two is Pounds 1.60. It is
open Monday to Saturday 8am to 12 pm and from 10 am on Sunday.
For Sloane Square and the King's Road, Cafe de Blank in the basement and
conservatory of the General Trading Company 144 Sloane Street is hard to
beat.
Breakfast includes kedgeree and omelette with herbs, or you can choose from
a tempting selection of pastries and healthy-sounding cakes. At lunchtime,
salmon cakes and dill sauce cost Pounds 6.95; home-made soup with cheese and
onion bread Pounds 3.25, perhaps followed by Greek yoghurt, honey and
almonds for Pounds 2.75. The staff are friendly and quick, the conservatory
overlooking the small garden is light and pleasant. Open from 9am to 6pm.
Serious shoppers often skip lunch and take tea instead. Brown's Hotel 30-34
Albermarle Street serves tea from 3-6pm every day. The lounge is warm,
quiet, comfortable and highly soporific. I spotted two immaculately behaved
toddlers among the predominantly American clientele. Customers may have to
wait. Tea - a huge selection of cakes, scones and sandwiches is Pounds
12.95; high tea with a supper dish is also available. Gentlemen must wear
jacket and tie.
Tea is an equally well-established institution at The Hyde Park Hotel where
the sounds of the pianist tinkle across the elegant Park Room Restaurant,
which overlooks Rotten Row. Tea, sandwiches, scones and cream and cakes are
Pounds 10.50 per person. There is a cloakroom where visitors can leave
shopping. It is advisable to book. Tea is served daily from 4pm to 6pm.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Fashion: Banish the Grey - It is time for the British male
to brighten up his act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE his counterparts in the bird kingdom, the British male is usually
drab. There might be a flash of colour at the throat or on the chest, but he
shies away from primary or secondary colours, assuming he knows what they
are.
There is, however, change afoot and, like magpies, our British male is being
attracted to 'brights'. It could be a reaction to the grey weather, or a
long-delayed decision to make a visible display to attract the opposite sex.
Whatever the reason, sartorial life looks as if it is going to be more
colourful in 1993.
Once colour was the preserve of the Italians, the French, and even the
Americans (remember all those bright tuxedos?). Now the British male is also
being tempted to buy clothing which is not grey, black or navy.
You will not see the migrating flock of grey suits on London Bridge turn
overnight into an exotic and colourful flight, but you will begin to see red
jackets appearing on the street, at parties and in restaurants. Red is no
longer the exclusive domain of huntsmen, guardsmen or Butlin's redcoats.
There are those who think that colour does not become the British
complexion. But this is a fallacy; in the 18th and 19th centuries, the male
was a peacock and it is only during this century that colour has become
associated with vulgarity, eccentricity and effeminacy.
But greys, blacks, browns and dark blues have now become the colours of the
male plumage, with the occasional chance to wear some bright tweed in the
country or a pastel blazer in the summer at some jolly boating event.
Now the British male has the opportunity to invest in colour for his
wardrobe. In most menswear shops, from the easily accessible Oakland and
Next to Jones with its emphasis on top-class international designers,
colours across the spectrum are being introduced on to the rails.
And Paul Smith proves that English designers are not afraid of colour,
offering not only clothing but also belts and shoes in various colours.
In Savile Row, a cuckoo has appeared among the distinguished ranks - Richard
Jones offers beautifully cut 'traditional' clothes made from wonderful cloth
in marvellous hues.
Colour is not about vanity - we all perhaps remember too well the Aesop
fable in which the crows gathers feathers from other birds so as to be able
to rival the peacock, only to be humiliated because of his presumption.
Instead, it is about having the confidence to pluck out just a handful of
grey feathers and replacing them with some brighter ones.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Plans for a garden sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE BOUGHT the house in which we live, with a garden, six years ago. This
year we received planning permission for a house on the rear part of the
garden.
1) Can we avoid capital gains if we sell the land with planning permission
before we sell our house, using that land as part of the garden right up to
its sale?
2) The land with planning permission is separately registered. It was added
to the original garden nearly 50 years ago (we bought the house and the
whole garden as a single transaction). We are about to remortgage our
property if we exclude that land from the mortgage, could this affect the
capital gains position?
1) Yes, in principle, provided that the tax inspector is (or the Appeal
Commissioners are) satisfied that you did not buy the house 'partly for the
purpose of realising a gain from the disposal of it' and that no expenditure
after the purchase was 'incurred wholly or partly for the purpose of
realising a gain from the disposal'. The words in quotation marks are from
section 224(3) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Ask your tax
office for the free pamphlet CGT4 (owner-occupied houses).
2) No (subject to the same proviso).
The solicitors who act for you in the remortgage - and the prospective sale
 -will be able to guide you through the CGT pitfalls etcetera, of course.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A return is good form
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE first year of independent taxation for married couples, my wife
made a claim to the Inland Revenue in respect of tax overpaid on her income
from investments, then largely in equities. The claim was met, and she was
sent another tax repayment claim form for the subsequent year.
She has not used the form because she has since arranged matters so that the
nil-rate tax band is covered by income from investments not taxed at source.
She plans to continue this process, as nearly as possible and in balance
over the years.
The Revenue has taken no further interest in her affairs, and meanwhile the
tax vouchers, contract notes, and other records are piling up. How long
should they be kept in case of future approaches from the Revenue?
Even if your wife has been skilful (or lucky) enough to arrange that her
untaxed income of 1991-92 amounted precisely to Pounds 3,005, we recommend
that she submit a tax return / claim. Even if you are both a long way from
your 65th birthdays, and your wife does not wish to claim any part of the
married couple's allowance, it will be simpler in the long run if she
continues to submit tax returns.
You may like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR80(1992)
(Income tax and married couples) and IR84(1992) (Have you anything to
declare?).

FT  02 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My hidden relatives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM 1985 I lived with a woman as common law man and wife. She died recently
intestate. There are no blood relatives alive. Should a step sibling
materialise what is my legal position as regards the disposal of her house
and possessions?
If the deceased left no relatives of the whole blood, the rules of intestacy
specified in the Administration of Estates Act 1925 and the Intestates'
Estates act 1952 allow brothers and sisters of the half blood or, failing
them, uncles and aunts of the half blood to inherit. If anyone in either
class were found, they would (together with all others in the same class)
inherit all the estate, equally between them if there is more than one.
If diligent enquiry produces no one in either class, the Crown will take the
estate, but you can make a claim to an ex gratia provision for yourself from
the Treasury Solicitors' Bona Vacantia department, it is usually
sympathetic.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A little chandlery still clinging
to the rigging - A small shopkeeper's fight to stay afloat in a hostile
climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNER shops are businesses. They are one of the simplest forms of
enterprise allowing owners to be their 'own man.' They also account for a
substantial chunk in the long litany of recent small company collapses.
Sometimes, it is a case of too many newsagents in one neighbourhood, or a
village where economic life has been deadened by weekenders. In others, it
is a personal failure to grasp the basics of buying and selling and
controlling costs.
The short history of Yacht Parts, a marine chandlery actually housed in a
larger-than-average corner shop in London, shows many of the serious
difficulties afflicting small shop-based operations.
The owner, Adrian Burks, remains confident about the company's future, but
he can reflect on a series of crises since he started up in 1984. Opening
another site in East Anglia nearly three years ago wrecked the company's
cash flow and nearly broke it. Switches in customer demand have been awkward
to deal with, and a computer system difficult to set up and run.
Lower profit margins have dogged the business. In its first full year, Yacht
Parts broke even on a turnover of Pounds 90,000. In 1991, it squeezed a
profit of Pounds 6,000 on Pounds 345,000 turnover. In the year to September
1992, it rolled up a loss of Pounds 13,000 on Pounds 254,000.
So, it is hardly surprising that 36-year-old Burks says: 'It has become
clear, as a result of analysing both costs and sales, that a big marketing
effort is needed to increase turnover to cover costs. In the past, we have
been drowning in our own mess. We have cut costs and I feel we can increase
turnover by a quarter over the next 12 months.'
Now, Burks is accelerating the process of transforming Yacht Parts from a
chandlery serving the recession-hit boating fraternity to a broader supplier
of products, from outdoor clothing to rigging for the interior design
industry.
With his brother, Burks inherited a yacht-chartering business before joining
one of the handful of chandleries in London. In 1984, the brothers set up
their own business in the same premises Burks still uses in Fulham. 'We had
Pounds 5,000 of our own money, Pounds 5,000 from an investor friend and a
Pounds 10,000 overdraft from Lloyd's bank.' Rent was then Pounds 5,000 a
year but, with rates, has risen to more than Pounds 18,000.
The shop still caters for boat-owners living in London. But, two-and-a-half
years ago, Burks made the mistake of opening another arm at Shotley,
Norfolk. 'It's at the end of a peninsula served by a small marina road. The
only captive market was the boats in the marina and the promise of a larger
marina development never materialised.
'We were there for a year. We didn't take a direct loss but we bought in a
lot of stock, some of which we had to sell at below cost. It gave us
terrible cash flow problems from which we are only beginning to pull out.'
Burks is most concerned now with is the need to move the business further
away from its roots. The Fulham shop is still packed with stuff for messing
about in boats, from dinghy splash suits and compasses to floating winch
handles and miniature electronic navigation systems. But he is fleeing from
some of the products on which the company was built.
Chandlery, which accounted for 60 per cent of business four years ago, now
makes up less than a third of sales and is likely to fall to 20 per cent or
so. Burks explains: 'That is partly because margins are so low due to the
recession and the difficulties of managing hardware. Holding chandlery
stocks can be a nightmare.' He cites the 500 types of stainless steel screws
used in boats, and the chandlery supplier with a 300-page catalogue covering
thousands of products.
Second-hand equipment, from navigation lights to portable toilets, has
dropped from a quarter of Yacht Parts' business to just a few per cent.
'People are keeping hold of things much longer,' he says. Sales of
electronic equipment are also much less important. 'There are specialist
mail order companies doing this. What's the point of making Pounds 5 on a
Pounds 200 item?'
To compensate, he is counting on clothing and rigging. A much wider range of
outdoor clothing and shoes now makes up more than a third of sales, and
Yacht Parts has negotiated a couple of exclusive distribution arrangements
with British clothing suppliers.
Burks says rigging accounts for a quarter of sales and this is growing,
particularly for building work and interior design. One of his contracts -
which includes installation - is a design feature at a London suburban
railway station.
Yacht Parts has some heavy overheads. Burks' modest yearly salary is Pounds
14,000, wages are Pounds 21,000 a year; transport Pounds 7,000 and a stand
at the London Boat Show, and preparations for it, Pounds 8,000. 'We tried to
do without advertising, but that was a mistake and we are spending about
Pounds 13,000 a year on that.'
Burks still faces big problems with turnover and lack of profit. He plans to
try to raise prices by 10-15 per cent and use much more direct marketing.
That includes direct mail promotions for the firm's rigging service to
theatres, exhibition halls and sports facilities, and direct mail to yacht
charter operators and yacht clubs.
Yacht Parts has started offering deals to businesses in west London,
allowing their staff discount prices on its goods.
To help control stocks, potential customers can now sit in an office and
choose chandlery items from a battery of catalogues. Burks will order the
goods as one-off items.
The company also took 18 months to get its Pounds 1,200 computer system
running properly. 'A friend eventually acted as consultant,' says Burks, who
has never taken a business course. He admits: 'I would have benefited from
one. A friend of mine has an MBA and he has lit up a lot of things, even
with a simple question like: 'How much is that photo-copier really costing
you?' I had no idea.'
Burks says the business was in real trouble in the spring. 'I had cash flow
and stock control problems. The pick-up in trade did not take place. I felt
very low. I was looking at a black hole.' But two new investors have
injected Pounds 20,000 between them.
'That picked me up and I now have more people to offer advice,' says Burks.
He recognises, though, that a lot of work, carefully thought-out decisions
and a bit of luck will be necessary to put the business on a more secure
footing.

FT  02 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: As rare as a Brandenburg olive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I POPPED over to Brussels for the New Year to see my Luxembourg friend,
Jean-Peter Martini. He is still at the European Commission, running the new
Language Harmonisation Programme.
I showed my alarm when I heard about it but he said that I need not worry.
'It isn't one of those 'intrusive' programmes that you British go on about
it's just to clear things up at the edges. To gain uniformity in common
usages.'
He slapped a Dutch newspaper in front of me. A headline read, De zonnebloem
zake. 'You see that was about the oilseed row with the US. It is a joke, but
incomprehensible to the British.'
'Dutch jokes normally pass us by.'
'That is not the point,' said Jean-Peter heatedly. 'It means 'The sunflower
case' - a reference to the Tintin books. The character you call Professor
Calculus is Professor Sunflower.'
In my amazement, or apathy, I emitted an expletive.
'That is another problem - differential swearing. Do you know that in 1992
two German-speaking correspondents in London could not translate the simple
English word 'bugger', which was essential to their articles? Bernhard
Heimrich of the Frankfurter Allgemeine did a piece on the British honours
system and how the initials were vulgarised - KCMG stands for 'Knight
Commander of St Michael and St George' and becomes 'kindly call me God' and
so on. Well, when he got to Order of the British Empire, or whatever OBE
stands for, he wrote, 'Other buggers' efforts', which can't be correctly
translated into high German.' Charles Ritterband in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung
quoted George V's dying words 'Bugger Bognor' and has to render them as 'To
hell with Bognor'.'
I agreed that was a problem.
'But we are making progress in other areas,' said Jean-Peter. 'We are trying
to establish a fixed system of cliche exchange that would enable politicians
to be immediately understood. People often take each other literally and the
misunderstandings are dreadful. You must come to 'Eurocliche '93' in Essen
in March. It's going to sort these things out. Britain is making a huge
contribution.'
He pointed to a board on which was written, 'You can't kick start the
economy by moving the goalposts on a level playing field.'
'As it stands that sentence is quite incomprehensible, except in Greek. It
gives our interpreters enormous problems.'
Elsewhere I saw other country's contributions. The French offered Nous
n'allons pas nous noyer dans la morosite du bouc-emissaire a la derive.
'Hmm.' I said, ''We aren't going to drown in the gloom of the rudderless
scapegoat.' Not bad.'
'But what does it mean?' shouted Jean-Peter. 'Look at this - Wir sehen im
Fass ohne Boden die Reflexion des wiederaufgebauten Hunnen-Schreckenbildes.'
'That's okay. 'We see the reflection of the reconstructed Hun shock-picture
in the bottomless barrel.' It's about the new Nazis in Germany.'
Jean-Peter tore it up, not wanting to waste time on anything sensible. His
plan is to compile a list of phrases in each language which could be
appropriately adapted - 'words which can move across national frontiers as
easily as a 40-ton truck.'
'But the trouble then,' I mused, 'is that you will end up with things like
'We must implement appropriate computer software management modalities.' All
familiar and all in English.'
'If we stopped there you might be right. That phrase is no good - it should
incorporate actually existing reality.'
'I say, that's not bad. 'Actually, exist . . .'
'. . . ing reality. Precisely. I used the phrase advisedly. We have
developed, 'The leitmotiv of actually existing reality is to be seen in the
sine qua non of the acquis communautaire.' That refers, of course, to the
evolution of the post-Maastricht ratification process of widening and
deepening the Community.' Jean-Peter paused a moment, gave a faint leer and
said, 'A thirsty teetotaller prefers a pastis to a pickled herring.'
'I beg your pardon.'
'That's one of our new cross-border proverbs and sayings. Delors is going to
use it next week. I hope you won't break the embargo on it. Perhaps you can
help, on a freelance basis. We pay for new sayings.'
'I'll have a go.'
'And don't waste time like a Spanish waffle-maker or turn it all into a
Pomeranian paella, these things are as rare as a Brandenburg olive . . .'
'I won't fail - I'll wager all Lombard Street to a China orange on it.'
'Hey, that's good. I'll add it to the list.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: New stock account
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Building Society is offering a second version of its guaranteed
stock market account, Stock Index Plus. The account has a five-year term,
but is slightly unusual in that it allows investors to benefit from a
partial guarantee in the intermediate years.
After one year, investors will receive their money back or 50 per cent of
the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index (whichever is the higher); after two years,
105 per cent of their original investment, or 60 per cent of Footsie's rise,
and so on, building up to the five year guarantee of 125 per cent of the
original investment, or 100 per cent of the Footsie's rise.
There are two caveats, however - gains will be taxed as income, so taxpayers
who have not used up their Capital Gains Tax allowance would do better to
choose an indexed unit trust. The investor benefits only from the capital
rise in the Footsie, not from any dividend yield.
The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and the issue is open for investment
between January 2 and February 25.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Sales continue to outweigh purchases
 -Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH THE market reaching new highs, it is not surprising that the number of
sales is far outweighing the number of purchases. Nevertheless, there are
more purchases this year than there were at the same time last year.
At the end of October, three main board directors of Babcock International,
the heavy engineering concern, were buying their own shares below 30p. This
latest purchase by Jeffrey Whaller, the deputy chairman, is altogether
larger and more convincing. Investor sentiment may be negative over the
short term, but a pattern of support from the boardroom is clearly emerging.
Another company with an uncertain future is Amstrad, the consumer
electronics group. Alan Sugar's proposed buyout has failed, raising
questions about his long-term commitment to the company's future.
The sales by Malcolm Miller and Robert Watkins of 714,000 and 563,500 shares
at just over 23p do little to change investor perception of the company,
particularly when these sales represent their entire holdings.
John Munro, managing director of Fairway Group, which supplies computer
stationery for the freight industry, developed a keen appetite for his own
stock last year.
He bought a total of 590,000 shares the most recent batch of 375,000 at
37.5p. The first purchases, made in February and March, were executed at
prices between 44p and 48p.
When Henlys Group fought off an unwanted bid from rival motor dealer T
Cowie, one might have expected its share price to have gone into reverse. On
the contrary, two features have combined to reassure investors: firstly
sales of cars and commercial vehicles have improved sharply, against market
expectations.
Secondly, the company was forced to cut costs aggressively making it a more
attractive recovery prospect.
With the share price back at 73p, Robert Wood, chief executive, has bought
35,000 shares, taking his holding up to 168,000.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The heavy cost of sending money - A
look at the best - and worst - ways to transfer money abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGY for sending money to people overseas is still in its infancy. If
you are carrying a plastic card while travelling, cash services available
are endless. The past year's turmoil on the foreign exchange markets has
demonstrated how easy it is for large companies and financial groups to
transmit money across national boundaries.
But for individuals sending small amounts overseas to friends or family,
money transfer is disquietingly expensive.
The Consumers' Association experimented last year by sending 160 payments of
around Pounds 100 each between banks in 11 European countries, using both
telex and mail transfers. They were so alarmed by the results that they
called on the European Commission to intervene on consumers' behalf.
Charges were excessive at an average of Pounds 13, with a maximum of Pounds
35 representing up more than a third of the money being sent. Average
transfer time was eight days, and three transfers were lost altogether.
According to the CA: 'Six months after they were sent (and paid for), the
banks still say they can't find them. As the law stands they don't have to
pay us any compensation.'
Transfers are charged on complicated sliding scales, and banks may make
different charges according to the currency you are using.
Several banks are developing international networks, which go a long way to
solving the problems. But these are still small, and cannot offer the
comprehensive service available via credit cards for those making payments.
Banks which have worked on this include the Co-operative, which charges a
flat Pounds 5 fee (even to those who do not have an account with the banks)
to use its Tipa-net system.
This is a collaboration between co-operative banks in France, Belgium,
Germany, Italy and Canada - it does not cover any other countries. The
number of working days to process the transaction can be guaranteed in
advance if both you and the recipient have accounts with the banks involved.
However, the system can be used at the same cost, but with the possibility
of longer delays, if neither has a Co-op account. Payment in cash is
recommended.
Girobank offers transfers into girobank accounts in 16 other countries for a
flat fee of Pounds 2, and can also provide foreign bank cheques for a flat
Pounds 5.
Royal Bank of Scotland offers IBOS (Inter-Bank Online System) with Banco
Santander in Spain and BCI in Portugal. This guarantees a 'same-day'
transfer, for a minimum charge of Pounds 6 and a maximum of Pounds 12). You
need to direct the money to an account with the recipient bank in Spain or
Portugal for the system to work. The system hopes to expand into France.
Other ambitious 'same-day' services come from American Express and Western
Union. The Amex 'MoneyGram' is not restricted to its cardholders and allows
you to send up to Dollars 10,000 to an American Express service centre in
another country. The funds can be picked up by the recipient in cash, or
travellers' cheques. If you and the recipient are near Amex service centres
(of which there are 12,000) this is one of the most convenient ways of
sending money in an emergency.
However, it is expensive. For amounts between Dollars 100 and Dollars 300,
the fee is Dollars 35. For figures above there is a sliding scale, with a
maximum of Dollars 200 for sums between Dollars 7500 and Dollars 9800.
Western Union offers a similar same-day service. If you want to send money,
telephone their toll-free number (0800-833833). This will give you the
address of your nearest agent, where you go to deposit your money (either
cash, bankers' draft or building society cashiers' cheque).
The money can then be made available to anyone producing the necessary
identification at any of 20,000 WU agents across the world. Again, the
service has a heavy price. Transfers up to Pounds 25 will cost Pounds 8. A
sliding scale leads to a maximum charge of Pounds 105 for transfers between
Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 3,000.
Eurocheques offer good value for small payments within Europe, according to
the Consumers' Association. The Eurocheque can be sent by post and the
recipient then pays it into their bank account. Charges are around Pounds 2
for a payment of Pounds 100 and the account will normally cost about Pounds
5 to open.
Other methods include currency drafts or mail transfer. If you opt for the
currency draft, you post it to the recipient yourself, who then can encash
it. International Money Orders, usually available only in sterling or US
dollars, work in the same way and tend to be slightly cheaper.
Mail transfers are done by the bank. For greater safety, and expense, you
can use a telex transmission. For this you will need full details of the
destination bank account.
Charges for standard drafts from high street banks are:
Barclays offers Barclaydraft in 21 currencies to its own customers, and is
available for amounts up to Pounds 5,000. There is a flat rate charge of
Pounds 11. Others can have International Money Orders in dollars or sterling
only up to Pounds 5,000, for a cost of Pounds 7 up to Pounds 1,000, and
Pounds 11 for amounts above this.
Lloyds has a minimum charge of Pounds 15 and a maximum of Pounds 50 for
currency drafts. The basic fee within these limits is 0.3 per cent of the
amount sent.
Midland charges a flat Pounds 6 for drafts up to Pounds 100, and then 0.5
per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 10 and a maximum of Pounds 32 for larger
figures.
National Westminster charges a minimum of Pounds 7.50 and a maximum of
Pounds 50 for foreign currency drafts.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: A year of dull times and minor
disasters - Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING back at the end of a year is a useful exercise in highlighting the
errors and successes of the previous 12 months in the hope that they can be
avoided or repeated.
As a private investor, I found 1992 rather dull. My trading in shares was
very limited compared with, say, the 1980s, when I would trade very
actively, sometimes selling shares in certain companies within months, or
even weeks, of buying them. Of course, I also bought some shares then for
the longer term but, in those years, there seemed much more excitement in
the market, with more takeovers, more small companies having share prices
that rocketed almost overnight before, perhaps, taking some months or years
to collapse.
To me, profits seemed fairly easy to make, especially as I had taken evasive
action before the 1987 crash and then taken advantage of lower prices
afterwards to build my portfolio.
Other decisions I made in the 1980s also proved to be helpful in
safeguarding myself in the 1990s. For example, I sold my last property share
in 1989 and so did not suffer from seeing shares in some property companies
rendered valueless when the companies went into liquidation in 1992. I also
resisted the blandishments, made on several occasions in the early and
mid-1980s, to become a Lloyd's Name. I was not prepared to risk the amount
of money expected of a Name without having much more direct control over the
investment.
Bitter experience has taught me never to trust anyone in business - if I
cannot 'get out quick' and promptly cut losses, I am only prepared to risk
comparatively modest sums.
However, this year's disasters include not 'getting out quick', even when
the opportunity was available. Over the years, I have made some useful
profits via my personal pension scheme by buying and selling the capital
shares of Scottish National Trust. I appreciated that, due to the structure
of the various classes of shares in this investment trust, the share price
of the capital shares tended to be highly volatile, but I did not keep a
close enough watch on the share price and the performance of the company.
The share price fell rapidly this year from 42p to 12.5p, before perking up
to 18p and I should have cut my losses much sooner. Fortunately, my holding
had been very modest.
The same is true of my other investment trust disaster - 1,500 shares in
Gresham House. An earlier article described how I made this awful boob, but
this was compounded by keeping the shares rather than dumping them when they
first started to go into freefall last year - and even retaining them in
1992 when I could have sold them for around 18p to 25p each. I took the view
that a holding worth only Pounds 270 was not worth the effort of further
research and so held on in the hope of a miracle. I should have sold. The
shares are now quoted at 2p each.
My wife proved more astute when she sold her last Liberty voting shares for
575p in August while my personal pension fund hung on in the hope that Brian
Myerson's approach, via Concerto, to 'ginger up' the company would result in
a longer term appreciation of the underlying value of Liberty. Sadly, this
did not happen - by the time I sold, I received 550p a share.
I still made a useful profit and the voting shares have now fallen to less
than 500p. However, I will continue to follow Liberty's progress in case
there are signs that renewed buying could prove profitable.
Another disaster was HC Slingsby, where my personal pension scheme has, over
the years, been steadily reducing its holding, but not fast enough. I could
have sold Slingsby for around 150p to 170p in February, but again held on in
the hope that this small company, which makes ladders and trucks, would be
the subject of a takeover bid. By the time I sold, in April, the price was
down to 110p.
Looking back, it would seem that takeover hopes have caused me to hold on to
shares in a year that has been noteable for its decline in takeover
activity. It is never going to be possible to pinpoint exactly when a share
may rise on rumours of a takeover approach, and I have been prepared to hold
shares for years in the hope of such an approach - especially when my
confidence is boosted by such events as the February takeover of sweetmaker
Taveners by a Danish chocolate and confectionery group which paid 165p a
share. I had bought Taveners in 1987 for 58p each.
During 1992, I sold more shares than I bought, taking advantage of rising
prices to make profit in a market which I thought was generally approaching
overvaluation. The companies whose shares I did buy, such as The Investment
Company, and increased holdings in Treatt and Photo-Me, were bought with the
long term in mind - rather like laying down wine to mature.
My best investments, however, were achieved as a result of Black Wednesday
in September, when the pound was devalued. In 1991, I bought shares in
Nestle for my pension scheme because I thought the company was well-run and
undervalued. With its worldwide spread of investments, and being based in
Switzerland, its shares offered some protection against a falling pound. The
shares cost the equivalent of Pounds 319 each in March 1991. They are now
worth more than Pounds 500 each, having risen sharply after Black Wednesday.
As 1992 progressed, I became more and more concerned about the overvalued
pound and felt that a sharp correction was long overdue. On September 4, I
put a large part of my pension scheme's surplus cash into Swiss francs at a
rate of 2.4665 to the pound. The rate is now around SFr2.196, which means
that every Pounds 10,000 invested in September is now worth about Pounds
11,232 - plus interest. I shall certainly be considering further currency
transactions in 1993.
My sole theatrical investment, Return To The Forbidden Planet, continued its
successful run in the West End and, since originally making that investment
in 1989, every Pounds 1,000 invested has paid out Pounds 1,080 of profit,
with the promise of more to come. During 1993, the show will embark on (I
hope) a successful tour of the UK.
Unfortunately, I also invested in the US version of the show. The show
closed and I lost my entire investment in it. But then, I did enter it with
my eyes wide open, appreciating the high risks of theatrical investment.
Premium bonds in 1992 continued to be a disappointment, although I think
Ernie should really be re-christened Ernestine, as in the period 1987 to
1992 inclusive, in every year except one, my wife has won more money than I
have. This year the sexist computer still preferred my wife. We each have
the maximum Pounds 10,000 holding - she won a total of Pounds 750 (15 Pounds
50 prizes), while my total winnings were a pathetic Pounds 400. My eldest
daughter did much better. She only had Pounds 100 of bonds and won Pounds
50. With reductions in the size of the prize fund, I am seriously
considering reducing our bond holdings.

<TEXT>
FRAMLINGTON is marking the new year by launching four unit trusts. All are
initially aimed at the institutional market, but only one (the Exempt
Balanced fund) is exclusively so. The three other trusts - American Growth,
UK Growth and Emerging Markets - all have minimum investments of Pounds 500,
so are easily available to small investors.
The American Growth fund will invest in large and medium companies in the
US, Canada and Mexico, and will complement the group's existing American
Smaller Companies trust. The UK growth fund will invest in large and medium
sized UK stocks.
All the trusts, except Exempt Balanced, will have an initial charge of 5 per
cent; American Growth and Emerging Markets will have annual charges of 1.25
per cent and UK growth 1 per cent.
*****
Building Societies have noticed that nervous borrowers are opting for fixed
rate mortgages in higher numbers. However, the rates on offer are not as
good as they were two months ago. Chelsea building society is today
launching three fixed mortgages. One is fixed until June 30, 1995 at 7.95
per cent (for loans up to 90 per cent of valuation). The other two are fixed
until June 30, 1997.
For loans up to 60 per cent of valuation the rate is 8.50 per cent, and for
those up to 90 per cent of valuation, it is 8.75 per cent. Borrowers are
required to take out Chelsea's own house and contents insurance, and the
administration fee is Pounds 195. interest only and repayment mortgages, as
well as pension and endowment deals, are available.
*****
Britannia building society has launched an 8.75 per cent mortgage fixed for
five years. The arrangement fee is Pounds 225, and early redemption attracts
a penalty of 180 days' interest. Interest only and repayment mortgages are
available but you are required to buy Britannia's own house and contents
insurance.
*****
Societies are also waking up to the outflow of savers' funds into other
products following the autumn base rate cuts. National &amp; Provincial is
offering a one percentage point of extra interest for a month on its Instant
Reserve, Private Reserve and Investment Reserve accounts. Money must stay in
the accounts until the end of February, when the extra interest will be paid
for 31 days, based on the balance growth during January.
*****
Life Association of Scotland is one of the many companies trying to tempt
funds away from the building societies. It is promoting its 'Generator'
plan, a five-year temporary annuity linked to a personal equity plan. The
scheme is very similar to Scottish Widow's plan, marketing for which has
been sharply criticised by some advisers.
Part of the investment goes into the annuity, which pays out an income,
while the Pep aims to grow enough to restore the capital at the end of the
five years.
It needs to grow by at least 13 per cent per annum if the capital is to be
replaced in full, so investors have a real chance of capital loss.
LAS is hoping to attract funds from building societies, but admits that the
exposure to equities means a higher level of risk. If capital is returned,
then income should total above 9 per cent annually, depending on the age and
sex of the annuitant.
*****
Falling interest rates do seem to mean some relief for those whose debts
were out of control. TSB has cuts the monthly interest rate on TSB Trustcard
and TSB MasterCard from 1.89 per cent to 1.79 per cent, with effect from
January 25.
The APR for purchases will be 23.7 per cent, and 24.1 per cent for cash
advances.
TSB still does not charge an annual fee for its credit cards, unlike any of
the big four clearers, and claims the latest move makes its credit cards
'among the most competitively priced available'.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Reforms urged for pensions - A look
at calls for a single pension regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Consumers Association this week added its voice to the calls for the
creation of a single regulator for pensions and a compensation fund for
occupational schemes.
The financial services industry has been putting forward its views on
pensions over the last few weeks, in submissions to the Pension Law Review
Committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Roy Goode.
The Goode committee was established in the wake of a report from the Commons
select committee on social security, which recommended changes to the trust
law which has been the basis of pension fund operation since the 1920s.
Debate has centred around the issue of compensation. The National
Association of Pension Funds originally proposed a compulsory scheme which
would refund a shortfall no matter how it had occurred. This was fiercely
attacked by the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the UK's second biggest,
which threatened to resign from the NAPF over the issue.
The association made a partial climbdown in its final submission to the
Goode committee, and recommended that schemes should cover fraud, theft and
negligence only. This view is backed by the CA which said that: 'A sensible
plan for compensating beneficiaries who lose out because of regulatory
failure must be established.'
'This would cover losses as a result of fraud,' says the CA, 'and as a
result of professional negligence where, for whatever reason, the members
cannot claim compensation from the professional concerned.'
The CA added that such a scheme should be funded through insurance, so that
poorly-administered schemes were not subsidised by well-run schemes.
However, if the insurance industry was not prepared to meet the risk, the CA
backed a compulsory levy on occupational schemes.
The electricity supply pension fund wanted any compensation scheme to be
funded by a combination of professional indemnity insurance, the Investors
Compensation Scheme (run under the Financial Services Act) and the
government. The liability of occupational pension schemes would be strictly
limited.
Over the question of regulation, the CA joins other organisations, such as
the Prudential and the Confederation of British Industry, in favouring a
single authority.
'A single statutory regulator, reporting direct to a single government
department, should be established to take responsibility for ensuring
investor protection and fair play in the occupational pensions sector.'
In addition, the CA called for
pension rights to be protected in an employee's contract of employment
trustees to be qualified, with one being given the responsibility of
ensuring the scheme's assets are safe.
professional advisers to have a repsonsibility to report suspicions of fraud
or maladministration.
members to be sent an annual statement of benefits and summary of accounts.
The Goode committee has received over 1,000 submissions in response to a
list of 81 questions it sent out in September. The committee is scheduled to
produce its report in the summer of 1993.
Meanwhile, the CA gave the government the dubious honour of its Captive
Consumer Award for its handling of the late Robert Maxwell's frauds.
'Official failure to regulate strongly and effectively culminated in Maxwell
pensioners being captive consumers' said Derek Prentice, CA assistant
director. 'They are prisoners of a pensions scandal for the rest of their
lives.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Sickening rule for employees -
Health insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH tax law is littered with arbitrary distinctions between employees
and the self-employed. The tax treatment of permanent health insurance (PHI)
is a case in point. As a rule - provided you stay healthy - you will be
better off in employment, but should you ever claim against the policy, then
self-employed status will prove more tax-efficient.
Plans to protect income against long-term disability have enjoyed growing
popularity in recent years, becoming an almost invariable feature of
executive remuneration packages. Until 1981, PHI was a taxable benefit for
directors and other higher-paid staff, although not for other employees. But
the 1981 Finance Act introduced a blanket exemption and PHI remains to this
day one of the dwindling band of tax-free perks.
Paying PHI premiums for staff gives an employer the best of both tax worlds.
Not only can he confer a tax-free benefit on his workers but also the cost
of so doing will be a deductible item for corporation tax purposes.
But while the taxman has a positive attitude to PHI for employees, his
approach is quite different if the insured is self-employed. Premiums paid
by the self-employed - whether sole proprietors or business partners -
cannot be deducted from their taxable profits. So if bosses are insuring
themselves and their staff, it will be worth their while asking the
insurance company to 'load' the premiums as far as possible on to the staff
policies.
The Inland Revenue's pro-employee bias is abruptly reversed in the event
that illness or accident leads to a claim for PHI benefit.
Some policies provide for lump-sum payments and these will normally be
tax-free, irrespective of the status of the recipient. But in the more usual
case of ongoing periodic benefits, employees draw the short straw.
This is because such benefits are taxed in precisely the same way as the
salary they are replacing. So income tax will be deducted through the
pay-as-you-earn system (even though the taxpayer is no longer in a position
to 'earn' anything) and national insurance contributions will also be due.
Although the self-employed are also subject to income tax, they can take
advantage of an Inland Revenue concession which affords them a significant
tax 'holiday'. The concession - that applies in the rare case of an employee
who has made his own PHI arrangements - stops the tax clock from running
until the unfortunate individual has been receiving PHI for one complete
fiscal year.
The length of the tax-free period will therefore be maximised if the insured
person can arrange to start drawing benefit immediately after April 6, the
first day of each tax year.
Take the case of Oscar, a Treasury mandarin who suffered a nervous breakdown
on Black Wednesday. Oscar had prudently arranged his own PHI policy which,
like many such policies, requires him to wait 26 weeks before claiming
benefit. He will therefore be able to draw his first monthly cheque on April
1, 1993. But if he does, his tax exemption will end on April 6, 1994,
because by then he will have been in receipt of benefit for a full tax year.
If, instead, he defers his first claim until May 1993, he will extend his
tax holiday until April 5, 1995. The sacrifice of a single monthly
instalment will be more than compensated by the extra 11 months of tax
immunity.
If, for example, Oscar's monthly benefit is Pounds 2,000, he will receive an
additional Pounds 22,000 of tax-free income. That means a saving - at the
basic rate - of Pounds 5,500.
Oscar's timing was relatively fortuitous. Obviously, for somebody whose
benefit entitlement is triggered nearer to the middle of a tax year, there
will come a point at which the cost of deferring benefits outweighs the tax
advantage.
Although the ability to receive up to two years' tax-free income is unique
to the self-employed, with no equivalent for employees, the position is
quite different where the individual concerned is an expatriate.
By a quirk of UK tax legislation, PHI payments to self-employed expatriates
are fully taxable in this country, after the expiry of the initial tax-free
period. By contrast, benefits paid to non-resident employees should escape
the Inland Revenue's clutches.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Saving with Sipps - Planning your
Pension / Schemes for company partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW WARWICK-THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGEL LAWSON, the former chancellor, did not introduce a new type of
personal pension scheme when he unveiled Self-Invested Personal Pensions
(Sipps) in his 1989 Budget. He merely reinvented a concept which has been
available in various forms since the 1980s.
But while Sipps (and their pre-1989 variants) are unlikely to be cost
effective for the man in the street, they can produce substantial cost
savings for groups of individuals, such as partners in the same firm.
The cost efficiency of Sipps compared with conventional policies is
illustrated in the table* which shows the impact of charges using a
Reduction in Premium (RIP) comparison. The RIP expresses the total charges
as a percentage reduction in every premium paid.
A large part of the charging structure of a conventional policy is related
to the commission paid to the salesman and the RIP has therefore been
calculated both on 'normal' policy terms and on nil-commission terms, using
for illustration the charging structure of Standard Life's retirement
annuity pension contract, ie their pre-July 1, 1988 policy.
The RIP also has an impact on maturity proceeds. For example, a policy with
a RIP of 14 per cent will have a maturity value of only 86 per cent of the
maximum notional fund available at the selected retirement age, ie the fund
which would be available if the policy was entirely free of charges.
Let us suppose that partners A, B and C all effect 20 year pension policies
on the same date for an annual contribution of Pounds 20,000. Partner A
effects his policy with Standard Life via his insurance broker on normal
commission terms, Partner B effects the same policy via a firm of consulting
actuaries on nil-commission terms and Partner C effects a policy linked to
his partnership Sipp.
If each partner's policy achieves a rate of return before charges of 13 per
cent per annum, Partner A's policy will be worth Pounds 1,612,000 and
Partner C's Pounds 1,785,000. Partner C's policy has the highest value
because it suffers the lowest charges.
Many people will rightly suspect that one key feature of this analysis is
the impact of commission on maturity proceeds. For example, the difference
between the value of Partner A's policy and Partner B's is Pounds 156,000.
This difference is the direct result of the commission structure.
Surprisingly, the difference between Partner B's policy and Partner C's,
Pounds 173,000, is even larger, indicating the substantial additional costs
borne by Partners A and B as the result of the insurer's own expenses.
Commission is, therefore, not the only handicap on the maturity of proceeds
of conventional policies.
Many pension advisers and investment managers dismiss the importance of
charges and point instead to the superior investment performance of the
product they are selling. This argument is realistic only when comparing
'like with like', for example, a Standard Life policy set up on normal terms
compared with a Scottish Widows' policy established on the same basis. In
such a case the difference in charges is likely to be slight and relatively
modest differences in investment performance will tend to 'lose' these
differences over time.
However, the argument for ignoring charges loses weight when comparing the
charges of conventional policies with Sipps. For example, in order for
Partners A and B to achieve the same (or better) policy maturity proceeds
than Partner C their policies must outperform Partner C's by around 1 1/2
per cent per annum and 1 per cent per annum, respectively. Over a 20-year
period this is very unlikely.
It is also possible to turn the outperformance argument on its head. One of
the advantages of a Sipp is that it does not necessarily have to produce the
best investment performance to outperform other policies. For example, in
the case set out above, Partner C's policy could underperform by 1 1/2 per
cent per annum and his policy's maturity proceeds would still be the same as
Partner A's.
Finally, on the subject of cost-efficiency, there are only two factors which
will influence the return achieved on a partner's pension contributions; the
rate of investment return and the level of charges incurred. Only the last
of these can be predicted with any certainty and every effort should be made
to keep them as low as possible.
Apart from the cost, the other great advantage of a Sipp is that the
partners appoint and control the investment manager. If the manager fails to
perform satisfactorily he can be sacked and replaced without penalty.
Contrast this to the position if partners hold conventional policies. If the
performance is poor, partners will have little sanction but to direct their
future contributions to another policy. They might also try to transfer out
of the poor performing policy but this is unlikely to be achieved without a
high penalty.
So why do relatively few partnerships have Sipps (or one of the pre-1989
variants)? The answer lies in a combination of the following points.
Most pension advisers are remunerated by commission. The best
self-administered schemes are set up on nil-commission terms so recommending
them is not usually in the interests of the adviser.
Sipps require partners to act collectively. This is hard to achieve in
practice and represents a 'difficult sale'. Most advisers will take the line
of least resistance and recommend conventional policies.
Partners tend to treat their financial affairs as private and separate from
those of their partners. Unfortunately, this unavoidably moves them towards
conventional, individual policies.
Setting up a Sipp requires skills which are not usually associated with the
commission end of the pensions industry.
Sipp skills tend only to be found in those advisers whose principal activity
is advising occupational group schemes. Such advisers only operate on a fee
paying basis and their services may only prove worthwhile if they are
appointed by the firm as a whole rather than individual partners.
Therefore, if more partners are to benefit from the type of policy arranged
for Partner C their firms need to recognise the need for fee-paying
professional advice.
Until then, sadly, most partners in professional firms will continue, quite
unnecessarily, to lose substantial parts of the pension funds in the form of
commissions and other expenses.
*Figures in the table are calculated assuming annual contributions of Pounds
20,000 and an annual rate of investment return of 13 per cent. It is assumed
that 15 partners participate in the Sipp, each contributing Pounds 20,000
per annum.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Slow but sure comeback - The homes
market will begin to move in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders are making tentative predictions of a gradual recovery in
the property market. Halifax, Nationwide and Leeds Permanent building
societies all said this week they expected house prices to stabilise this
year, but none predicted a rapid recovery.
Halifax, the largest society which lends to just under a fifth of mortgage
holders, said it expected prices to stabilise by the spring. They have been
falling by 0.5 to 0.7 per cent a month and are expected to continue dropping
over the winter.
The Halifax house price index showed a fall of just under eight per cent in
the year to November 1992. The society is reluctant to predict the extent of
recovery for this year, perhaps because it was too optimistic in its
predictions for last, when it forecast a rise in house prices in line with
an inflation rate of about four per cent.
In its review of the housing market in 1992, the society does, however,
forecast an important increase in the level of activity in 1993 - a
prerequisite for the market's recovery. Last year there were just 1.1m
housing transactions nationwide, representing about half the level of
activity in 1988. Halifax says it expects this number to rise by 15 per cent
in 1993.
It finds the main barrier to recovery is a lack of confidence among buyers
rather than an inability to afford property. Halifax says mortgage payments
now account for 25 per cent of earnings in the south east - the area worst
affected by the housing decline - compared with more than 60 per cent in
1989.
The Halifax says further measures could promote a more robust housing market
recovery, and suggests a number of moves the government could introduce.
These include reforming mortgage interest tax relief to increase benefits
for first-time buyers, and introducing a mortgage benefit scheme to assist
low-income homeowners.
By contrast, Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, eschews
'pill-popping policies which tend to give you a hangover'. The temporary
abolition of stamp duty on homes worth under Pounds 250,000, which was
lifted in August, is one measure he believes hindered, rather than helped,
the housing market.
'We believe house prices generally have stabilised and will show some signs
of an upturn, accompanied by increased market activity,' he said. 'But these
'green shoots' will only really take hold if they are rooted in the right
climate, and that means we need to see evidence of some global warming in
the industrial and commercial sectors.'
Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest lender,
said the government's plans to enable housing associations to buy around
20,000 empty houses would help reduce the overhang of unsold properties.
'There is undoubtedly pent up demand from would-be house buyers,
particularly first-time buyers, who have put their decisions to purchase on
hold over the past two years,' he said.
'However, this is counterbalanced by the continuing overhang of unsold homes
and there will have to be a significant increase in turnover before we see
any increase in prices.'
The National Association of Estate Agents reported this week that December
had been the busiest month in the past three years for agents. Michael
Jones, president, said: 'Although we anticipate there will be regional
variations, we suspect the market has already turned the corner and that it
could revive much quicker than even the Halifax is predicting.'
But bursts of activity have been seized on as evidence of a full recovery
too often in the past and cautious optimism is now the catchword of the big
building societies. 'Fears about job security and the economy as a whole are
the main factors affecting the housing market. Changes in confidence could
mean the recovery could be delayed or could be much stronger than now seems
possible,' said Melville-Ross.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Early start for BES season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1993 Business Expansion Scheme season seems to have started in 1992.
BESSA Plus (Second Series), launched last week, is a scheme sponsored by
Close Brothers and backed by TSB Bank, which will buy repossessed properties
from Hill Samuel Mortgage Services and let them for five years.
Its crucial extra ingredient, on top of the guarantee from a high street
bank, is the 'non-recourse loan'. This allows top-rate taxpayers effectively
to realise their investment after only six months - note that it is not
worthwhile for basic rate payers.
For every Pounds 1 invested (60p after tax for top-rate payers), Hill Samuel
will lend 72p to investors after six months. Investors can choose to
continue for five years, but Hill Samuel is obliged to make the loans
available.
The loans are 'non-recourse', which means they are secured only against the
BES shares themselves - Hill Samuel has no right to pursue investors for any
other part of their assets.
Similar schemes linked to the Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Ireland sold
out within a week of becoming available, and it looks as though it will be
difficult for those not already on Close Brothers' mailing list to invest in
the current offer - total capacity is Pounds 8.5m, and Pounds 3.5m had been
taken by New Year's Eve, when the offer had only been open for two days.
A similar scheme sponsored by Capital Ventures in conjunction with Cambridge
University also seems likely to be fully subscribed soon.
Would these schemes be worth holding on to for the full five years? Falling
base rates have cut sharply into the returns on offer, and TSB is offering
only Pounds 1.08 after five years for every Pounds 1 before tax spent now.
In 1991, offers of Pounds 1.35 for every Pounds 1.00 were common, although
they did not have the security of bank backing.
Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge Group, says current offers should be taken
up only by those who want to take advantage of six-month loans. This will
allow them to reinvest in the BES before the scheme is abolished at the end
of the year.
The budget, due in March, must put some question marks over the future of
this type of scheme, as the low risks and high returns available to top-rate
taxpayers seem out of line with the government's original intentions.
However, the crop of schemes is taking repossessed housing out of the
property market, removing a downward pressure on prices, so sponsors are
hopeful that the schemes will survive.
Banks and building societies - which are yet to get heavily involved with
the BES - benefit by removing large amounts of bad debt from their balance
sheets, so supply is likely to continue. Several sponsors are working on
issues to fund university accommodation, which lack bank guarantees and
loans, but may offer a higher return over five years.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Prevent costly mistakes -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPATRIATES are generally viewed as people who earn more and save more than
their stay-at-home compatriots. And that is often true.
But expatriates tend to work hard as well. Perhaps one result of this is
that some fail to give sufficient time to their own finances. Whatever the
reason, expatriate finance specialists regularly see evidence of the same
mistakes being repeated.
For a prosperous 1993 - and beyond - check that you are avoiding the
following slips:
Overlooking the different residence status of spouses. For example: wives
often become UK tax residents by visiting the country when accommodation is
available for their occupation (unless they have full-time jobs in which all
the duties are performed overseas). Such a status could result in UK tax
liability on overseas income and gains (including half shares of joint
holdings). But it can give rise to opportunities too, for example the
ability to invest in personal equity plans.
Failing to appreciate that accepting a UK directorship can give rise to
similar results, even in the case of those who are in full time work.
However, liability to tax on an overseas salary is prevented by the
operation of the 'foreign earnings deduction'. Aircrew, couriers and others
who perform 'duties of substance' in the UK are similarly at risk.
Assuming that UK interest paid to you without deduction of tax is tax
exempt. Payment gross is an administrative procedure which does not apply in
broken tax years, those of departure or return to the UK.
Ceasing to pay UK National Insurance contributions on going overseas. In
most cases, this is a mistake. Voluntary Class 3 contributions, costing
Pounds 263 per annum, can give rise to an effectively index-linked pension
of Pounds 2,815 per year plus, in the case of a married man, a further
Pounds 1,962 pa for his non-contributing wife.
Supposing that inheritance tax does not apply to assets earned and situated
overseas? This treatment is only available to those who are not domiciled in
the countries which make up the UK, as a result of having left Britain
permanently.
Overlooking local testamentary considerations when acquiring real estate
abroad. Often it will be desirable to make a will in the country concerned.
Even more importantly, you may find that local laws restrict your freedom to
decide the disposition of assets on your death.
Assuming that a UK property acquired after the date of your original
departure from the UK, will qualify as your principal private residence for
CGT purposes, purely because it is the only property you own. For there to
be any possibility of such qualification, you or your spouse would need to
live in it for, say, three months after acquisition and also to resume
residence there when your period overseas has ended.
Convincing yourself that 'no-one will know' is a suitable basis for tax
planning. Skeletons in cupboards have a habit of rattling at awkward
moments.
Assuming that complex solutions are inevitably superior to straightforward
ones. Before investing in insurance-linked arrangements, ask yourself
whether a direct investment will suffice. Before effecting a trust, ask if
it is essential. Both types of vehicle have important parts to play in the
field of tax planning. But both are frequently unnecessary. Remember that
'complex' is usually synonymous with 'expensive'.
Entering into long-term investment arrangements against a background of
future uncertainty. How many people would answer in the affirmative the
question, 'Is it a good idea to take on a ten year investment commitment
when you have job security for only three years?' But expatriates frequently
do it.
Attaching undue weight to the taxation treatment of any investment plan.
Taxation is important. But the most brilliant tax shelter ever devised can
be of little value if the investment fails to perform. The watchwords should
be, investment performance first, taxation treatment second.
Overlooking the inflexibility inherent in the surrender penalties attaching
to some investment arrangements. If initial charges are replaced by early
surrender penalties, well and good. But such penalties sometimes last for
five to seven years or longer. If, even with the lower initial charges, your
investment fails to perform, you may find yourself effectively 'locked in'.
Failing to plan your return to the UK in good time. Happily, after years of
urging by expatriate commentators - myself among them - this is much less in
evidence. However, cases still arise of expatriates who spend 25 years
abroad but leave themselves only 25 days to organise their return.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: New Year resolutions worth sticking
to - Looking for sensible investment advice? Scheherazade Daneshkhu talks to
financial advisers about opportunities for the year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN'S annus horribilis was shared by many last year, not least by
investors who found their options narrowing as the year progressed. The drop
in base rates, changes to National Savings and the sluggish performance of
equities made investment hard work.
It does not look any easier this year. But this is why New Year resolutions
should be made and adhered to. We asked a number of financial advisers which
resolutions would top their list for the New Year.
Wills and Inheritance Tax
Just in case this is your last year, Mark Bolland, of fee-based advisers
Chamberlain de Broe, urges those without a will to write one: 'From this
starting point individuals and couples can go on to wider areas of estate
and inheritance tax planning. Clearly, given the state of the economy at the
moment and the level of the PSBR, the government is likely to raise taxes. I
would have thought it rather unlikely therefore, that IHT - comparatively
small though the receipts may be - will be significantly reduced.'
People should also resolve to do something about their IHT liability, says
David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, by making use of the annual
Pounds 3,000 exemption and using the small gifts exemption - up to Pounds
250 to as many people as you like.
Money on Deposit
David Harris says savers should resolve this year not to keep all their
investments on bank or building society deposits now that interest rates
have dropped substantially, but should check alternatives. They should take
advantage of the maximum investment allowable into the current National
Savings issues and pay their next instalment - Pounds 1,800 - to their tax
exempt special savings account in the New Year.
Colin Jackson, of Baronworth investment services, advises those in a 90-day
bank or building society account to give notice and get out. 'The advantage
of a 90-day account (interest-wise) is now fairly minimal,' he says. 'I
anticipate that in the coming year there will be some new investment
products being launched. Those people who have their money tied up in a
90-day account will either have to miss out on an investment opportunity or
lose interest by withdrawing their money without giving the appropriate
notice.'
Personal Equity Plans
Resolve to look at the performance of your Pep if you have one says Harris,
and look also at the level of charges, administration and strength of the
company, adds Jackson: 'Peps are often sold to people who really do not need
them as their tax position is such that the tax free benefits of a Pep would
not apply. For those people there is no reason why they should pay the
higher charges incurred by investing through a Pep.' He reminds those who
need a Pep to take one out before the end of the tax year on April 5.
Investment Strategies
Robert Noble-Warren, of fee based advisers Murray Noble, says those with
cash should be open minded about investment strategies. Instead of
considering UK equities only, 'an alternative strategy is to have higher
holdings of cash and fixed interest, to invest much less than one would
normally in UK shares and take a small highly speculative holding in
emerging markets such as South China and Mexico,' says Noble.
Life Insurance
Most people in the UK are underinsured and Harris says people should resolve
to check to see whether their life insurance arrangements are adequate. He
says investors should keep their wits about them and resolve 'to
differentiate between life insurance for protection and other products that
purport to be investment plans but are life assurance by any other name.'
Retirement and pensions
All advisers urge readers to make a resolution that they will no longer put
off retirement planning. Harris and Jackson remind those in an occupational
pension scheme to maximise their contributions for the year (up to 15 per
cent of net relevant earnings subject to the pensions cap). Harris says
policy holders should check the value of their pension arrangements and, if
the policy holder is contracted out of Serps, to see whether proper rebates
have been applied to a personal pension plan.
Jackson thinks those who are contracted out should reconsider their
decision, particularly if they are men over the age of 45 or women over 40.
He reminds higher rate taxpayers to consider picking up unused pension
relief for the past six years and paying a single premium before April 5.
'The tax inspector will give you relief in the current year initially at
your highest rate of tax. However, you can put in an election (not later
than July 5 1993) to carry back the relief to the year ended April 5 1992,
if this is more tax efficient,' he says.
Retirement may become a more risky business, warns Noble. Employers are
moving to money purchase schemes since these are cheaper than final salary
schemes. The reduction in interest rates means that a smaller pension will
be bought with the accumulated pension fund than in recent years, state
pension benefits are likely to be reduced and pension funds can expect lower
growth from equities than they experienced in the 1970s and 80s. Pension
contracts are being sold on growth rates allowed by Lautro, the regulator
for the insurance industry, but Noble believes these estimates are too
optimistic. He says, therefore, it is important to take impartial advice.
Mortgages
Harris would like homeowners to check whether their lender has dropped its
rate in line with others and consider whether a fixed rate might not be more
suitable while interest rates are still historically low.
Guaranteed Bonds
Jackson believes investors should steer clear of guaranteed bonds for the
time being as rates are low. He also warns investors there are a number of
products on the market promising 'guaranteed' returns while the small print
reveals they do no such thing.
Business Expansion Scheme
The BES - which allows investors tax relief at their highest rate on up to
Pounds 40,000 invested in a qualifying scheme - will be abolished at the end
of the year. Chamberlain de Broe's Alan Greening reminds investors who have
not subscribed in the 1992-93 tax year they have an allowance of Pounds
80,000 to invest - Pounds 40,000 before April 5 and another Pounds 40,000
after that date.
'Many advisers who would in the past have been wary about using BES
investments for anything other than a small part of someone's portfolio, are
now using them as the basis for secure growth (over 10 per cent compound for
five years), allowing other more speculative investments to be chosen
alongside to provide the high levels of income no longer seen in building
society or fixed interest investments,' said Greening, who believes the
majority of current BES issues have become secure investments.
Last year a new type of scheme - 'non-status, non recourse loan' emerged and
have added flexibility to the tax-efficiency of BES investments for higher
rate taxpayers, according to Greening. These schemes grant tax relief about
six months after the original investment is made. The investor is then
offered a non-recourse loan of between 72 per cent and 76 per cent of their
original gross investment. 'It is now possible to secure Pounds 8,480 tax
relief from one Pounds 10,000 investment, by taking one investment for
Pounds 10,000 now, taking a loan-back after six months (Pounds 11,200
including Pounds 4,000 tax relief), and reinvesting the proceeds in a BES
for five years - thereby securing another Pounds 4,480 worth of tax relief,'
said Greening.
While the BES is now much safer than it used to be, Chantrey's Harris
advises potential investors to take advice before committing themselves. He
also warns that since a great deal of demand is expected of these schemes,
potential investors need to be prepared to act quickly to take advantage of
any offers.
Financial Advice
Jackson says people should ask their financial adviser how much commission
they are earning and whether they will share it with them. Bolland and
Noble, both fee-based advisers, urge people to move to fee-based advice for
impartial financial planning.

'A year of frustration and disappointment' is how analyst John Houilhan of
Hoare Govett describes 1992, after small company shares underperformed for
the fourth consecutive year. However, at least, small capitalisation stocks
rallied over Christmas. The Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) rose
5.3 per cent from 1147.06 to 1208.87 between December 17 and December 30,
while the County index climbed 5.5 per cent from 884.2 to 932.86 over the
same period.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Resignation boosts shares - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian shares moved up in the week that beleaguered president Fernando
Collor de Mello resigned. Politics has bedevilled the stock market which
began its slide in May when Collor's brother accused him of corruption. The
political crisis continued with a parliamentary inquiry and an impeachment
debate. The market has lost nearly half its dollar value since its peak in
April, according to emerging markets data provided by the IFC, part of the
World Bank.
The political crisis brought to an end a bullish run which saw the market
more than quadruple between January 1991 and April 1992. Share prices had
been pushed higher as foreign institutions were allowed to operate directly
in the market and other positive steps, such as tax reform and
privatisation, occurred.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust funds rise to all-time
high in November - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust funds under management rose to an all-time high at Pounds 61.95bn
in November, according to the Unit Trust Association. Net inflow, at Pounds
258m, was the highest for any single month since September 1991 - and it
scarcely seems coincidental that the Building Societies Association reported
a net outflow of Pounds 184m for the same month. Lower interest rates are
forcing savers to look around for the best rates.
Cash and fixed interest unit trusts, not traditionally high sellers,
accounted for most of the inflow of funds. These attracted a gross Pounds
820m and accounted for half of total net sales in the 11 months to the end
of November. Growth in funds under management in fixed interest sectors has
been startling - according to the UTA, money market funds under management
rose by 47.5 per cent, international fixed interest by 71 per cent, and UK
gilts and fixed interest by 23 per cent in the year to November.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Between the lines at Pentos - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTOS shares plunged to a seven-year low this week after Terry Maher's
specialist retail and office furniture group broke with tradition and
delivered a profits warning instead of a seasonal message of good cheer.
In the last two decades, Maher has transformed Pentos into an aggressive
high street retailer whose outlets include the booksellers Dillons and
Hatchards, Ryman the stationers, Wilding office equipment and Athena
Galleries, which sells posters and prints.
Although Pentos is perhaps best known for its opposition to the price
controls of the Net Book Agreement, the source of shareholder grief this
week had little to do with the group's rapid expansion, or book pricing
policy.
Dillons, including Hatchards, which was acquired two years ago, accounts for
around 60 per cent of group operating profits, and remains the pride of the
Pentos group.
Its branches have been equipped with modern electronics and it now ranks as
the second largest bookseller in the UK with a 12 per cent market share and
a target of 15 per cent by 1994.
In contrast, Ryman has been a relatively disappointing performer since its
acquisition in 1987. Turnover in 1991 was Pounds 27.8m and sales in 1992 are
expected to show meagre one per cent growth.
Overall, Pentos' pre-tax profits for the year which ended on Thursday are
set to drop by two-thirds to about Pounds 5m because of poor Christmas sales
at Athena, a fourth-quarter slump in office furniture orders, and a clutch
of exceptional costs.
Sales at Athena are particularly disappointing. The business is highly
seasonal, and its relatively high fixed costs and gross margins make it more
than usually sensitive to changes in sales volumes.
Sales have been hit at both ends of the product range. High-margin framed
print sales have fallen because of the slump in house sales while sales of
posters and other products, mainly targeted at the 14 to 24 year-olds, have
suffered because of demographic changes and unemployment which has hit this
group particularly hard.
Similarly, the office furniture division has struggled with a 25 per cent
contraction in overall market size over the past 12 months.
Pentos is reducing overheads by Pounds 2m a year in the furniture business
and by Pounds 1m a year at Athena. However, Pounds 2m in reoganisation and
other 'cleaning-up' costs imposed by Clive Gregory, who returned to Pentos
in October as finance director after a 10-year break, and a Pounds 1.5m
provision to cover surplus property costs at Hatchards, will be treated as
exceptional items.
The share price has fallen from a peak of 170p in October 1991 to 55p at the
close on Thursday. Arguably, Pentos was a recovery stock bid up too soon,
but the price may also be reflecting other anxieties. In particular, the
group has adopted a curious approach towards reverse premiums - the up-front
sweeteners given when taking up a lease. The 1990 profits were restated
(downwards) as a result of a change in the group's accounting methods for
these premiums, which are now spread over two accounting periods instead of
the old method of one year.
Another worry is that year-end net borrowings are likely to show a Pounds
28m increase to about Pounds 48m, producing uncomfortably high gearing of 50
per cent. However, capital expenditure and investment should both be lower
in 1993 and Pentos should generate cash for the first time in three years.
At some stage, it might also make sense for Pentos to offload the office
furniture business. This would enable the group to focus exclusively on
specialist retailing - particularly important if a booksellers' price war
ever breaks out.
Pentos has invested aggressively to build market share while reducing its
cost base. If consumer spending were to increase, it would produce a rapid
and substantial increase in profitability. Even without an economic upturn,
the group's underlying performance should be improved by the latest round of
cost cutting. The stock may well have been oversold.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Recovery is not business as usual - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHART alongside may hold the key to the stock market's performance in
1993. It shows the ratio of M4, the broadest measure of the money supply, to
GDP.
Over most of the past 12 years, the ratio has been rising steadily. For
every pound of GDP, people have been holding an ever-higher amount of money
in M4's cash, bank and building society accounts. The upward trend has
levelled off over the last couple of years, but the UK is still awash with
liquidity.
The Treasury argues that the steady upward trend simply reflects the rising
wealth of UK households. The flattening in the ratio over the past two years
echoes the damage done to wealth by the recession. Once that is past, the
upward trend will continue.
If that is so, there is little implication for the stock market. But
consider what might happen if the public's holdings of liquid funds
represent not merely a side-effect of increasing wealth but also a judgment
about relative rates of return.
For much of the past decade, nominal interest rates on pass-book accounts
have been comfortingly high. For the past few years, indeed, the funds that
make up the bulk of M4 have produced extremely attractive real rates of
return.
Since Britain left the ERM in September, interest rates have fallen sharply.
They are likely to fall further in the new year.
What will savers do with their money as building society accounts no longer
look so attractive? A similar - though deeper - cut in interest rates in the
US led to a flood of retail investors' money into the stock market, helping
to push it to new heights.
UK interest rates are unlikely to drop as far as those in the US. And
Britain does not have the same number of aggressive independent stock-market
investors. But it does have a large and imaginative collective investment
industry, skilled at channelling the public's savings into the most
appropriate market.
A strong start to the year for equities, building on the 129-point rise in
the FT-SE 100 index since mid-December, might make this task easier,
rekindling public enthusiasm for shares for the first time since the 1987
Crash.
Even if retail investors still steer clear of equities, however, a shift in
their portfolios might influence the stock market in a less direct way.
The post-September steepness of the yield curve - which rises from roughly 5
per cent interest rates on short-term retail deposits to an 8 1/2 per cent
yield on long-term gilts - allows individual investors to obtain higher
returns by moving along the curve.
If they do so in large numbers - either by buying gilts themselves or, more
plausibly, by buying insurance industry products backed by gilts - the huge
scale of the government's borrowing requirement for next year will become
much less threatening, to the equity market's benefit.
Such financial considerations apart, the equity market in the New Year is
likely to be dominated by the outlook for the economy. The current level of
share prices - with the FT-Actuaries industrials selling at 17 times
reported earnings - reflects the consensus that a slow, stuttering, recovery
from recession is under way.
In the last couple of weeks of 1992, however, hopes have spread that the
recovery may prove brisker than expected. The strong performance of the new
FT-SE Mid 250 index, which contains the mid-sized companies that rank just
below the FT-SE 100, reflects this view.
Typical Mid 250 companies are more focused on UK domestic markets than their
larger cousins; and the index also contains many companies from the capital
goods and construction supplies industries.
The Mid 250 index as a whole outperformed the FT-SE 100 by 6 1/2 per cent in
December, thanks to strong performances by such companies as Tiphook (up 30
per cent on the month); Shanks &amp; McEwan and T&amp;N (both up 25 per cent); BICC
(up 24 per cent) and Marley (up 23 per cent).
The optimism these movements reflect was reinforced by consumers'
enthusiastic shopping in the days just before and just after Christmas.
Share prices of stores rose six per cent in the last two weeks of the year,
putting them on a p/e ratio of 21, a figure that is clearly already
discounting good sales in 1993.
As the old year ended, it was left to the stores' more glamorous cousins,
the food retailers, to underline that the recovery will not simply be a
return to pre-recession business-as-usual.
During the three years or so of depressed economic activity, the world has
not stood still. Cost structures have been altered, new capacity has been
brought into use, competitive relationships have changed.
This is most obviously true for those companies faced with overseas
competition, for whom the EC's single market ushers in new challenges. But
it is also true for the gilded giants of food retailing, despite their
relative immunity to rivals from abroad.
The stock market's growing unease about how long the supermarkets will be
able to combine rapid growth and high margins showed up in a - perhaps
exaggerated - reaction to some small-scale price cuts by the big chains,
pulling the sector down 3.6 per cent on Wednesday.
At the end of the year's trading, the market was valuing supermarkets - on a
dividend yield of 3.12 per cent - less generously than stores (3.11 per
cent), something that has happened on only two other days in the past five
years. In this and other ways, the recovery is likely to be no respecter of
formerly comfortable certainties.

Pointers for the economic year ahead

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL hole recently opened in the space-time continuum and a sheaf of
letters dropped from the future into the FT's files.
Our crack team of reporters are not quite sure who the letters are from, but
careful analysis may provide some clues about the economic prospects for
1993.
Dear Bill
Glad you've forgiven me about the passport thing. I'm sure we can
re-establish that special relationship. Given your time at Oxford, I'm
certain, like me, you have developed a passion for cricket and Happy Eaters.
And we're both quite considerably fond of Chelsea (joke). Indeed now that
we've cut interest rates to 3 per cent and the pound is worth one dollar,
it's almost as if we're one country again.
Hope to see to you soon and you're welcome to look in our files on Dan
Quayle any time (only kidding).
Yours, John
Dear Helmut,
Will you please pass on to Herr Schlesinger our grateful thanks for the
one-eighth of a percentage point cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank
announced last week? I'm sure it will be invaluable in stimulating our
economy, and a great help when it comes to our Parliamentary elections in
May. Not] (as the stars of Wayne's World would say).
Yours, Francois
PS Sorry about our farmers setting fire to the Frankfurter and beer trucks.
Dear Francois,
Schlesinger Schmesinger. All that guy thinks about is the money supply.
Maybe if you sent some of your farmers to blockade Frankfurt, he might see
sense. Instead he keeps droning on about the cost of reunification. You
don't know anyone who wants to buy a small, former Communist country on the
cheap, do you?
Yours, Helmut
Dear (insert name of foreign leader),
Thanks very much for your congratulations on my election. I am afraid I will
not be able to visit your country until I need to look statesmanlike/ the US
economy recovers/1997. But in the meantime, I hope to arrange a high level
delegation led by Al Gore/Hillary/Socks the Cat. If you really want to help,
we would be very grateful if you cut your interest rates/cut your
tariffs/bought some GM cars. As a gesture of goodwill, I therefore include
tickets to Disneyland/tickets to my next saxophone concert/a grits recipe.
Yours, Bill
NB. Could the State Department delete where applicable?
Dear M Delors,
Good news about the Maastricht vote. Parliament approved everything, subject
to a few more minor opt-out clauses. Like the Common Agricultural Policy
(just kidding).
Yours, John
PS Have you tried Bill's grits recipe? Tastes considerably good with chips
and peas.
Dear Bill,
Sorry about the mistake with Hillary. My eyesight is fading these days and I
thought she was . . . anyway, tell her she has an even better right hook
than Edith Cresson.
In any case, now the Bundesbank has lowered its interest rates at last, the
strains on the ERM might lift. It's a pity there's only two currencies left
in it.
Yours, Francois
PS Also sorry about what the farmers did to Eurodisney. Apparently, it can
be fumigated in a few weeks.
Dear Norman,
Sorry about the cabinet reshuffle. It was time for a change and I wanted to
move in some new faces. I am sure you will rise to the challenges of the
Northern Ireland office.
Yours, John
Dear M Mitterrand,
We have an old saying in Arkansas: 'Don't enter the pigsty unless you're
ready to trade pork bellies.' We had a good laugh when we heard about what
your farmers did to Eurodisney and an even bigger laugh when Congress passed
the 'Goods from France (Large Tariffs) Act'. Enjoy your recession.
Yours, Bill
Dear Helmut
Oh dear] Now that the trade war with the US and the lingering effects of the
Bundesbank's policies last year have sent the whole of Europe into
recession, it seems that the Anglo-Saxon economies are the only ones which
will grow this year. If you need any tips on how to run a successful
economic policy, don't hesitate to call.
But I am really writing to put your mind at rest. I can categorically deny
the reports in the British press which claim that we will be leaving the
European Community and applying for England, Scotland and Wales to be the
51st, 52nd and 53rd states of the union. Oh no.
Yours, John
Dear Bill
All the terms seem OK with us. But can you remind me what comes after: 'Oh
say, can you see, by the dawn's early light'?
Yours, John

FT  02 JAN 93 / Markets: Into the New Year in an uncertain mood - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THURSDAY tea-time, with several hours of the old year left, Manhattan's
Times Square was already resounding to the blare of trumpets and gaudy
rattles: 1993, it seemed, could not come fast enough.
Wall Street investors know the feeling well. For much of 1992, their sights
have been fixed firmly on what the next 12 months may bring. There is, of
course, nothing unusual about stockmarkets anticipating the future. But, the
presidential election, dominated by its cries of change and transition, and
the turning-point reached in the domestic economic cycle, have given
investors a fixation with tomorrow's joys, obscuring the drearier realities
of today.
The final week of the year ran true to form. On the positive side, a raft of
year-end economic indicators provided further hints that the economy may be
pulling out of recession with some alacrity. The consumer confidence index
published by the New York-based Conference Board climbed 12.7 points during
December to 78.3, for example. This follows an 11-point gain in November,
and represents the highest level scored for one and a half years. (The
benchmark 100-point level was set in 1985, and a strong economy tends to
register a figure in the upper 80s).
Sales of existing homes were also shown to have reached their highest
monthly level for six years in November. This was quickly interpreted as a
signal that consumers are more optimistic about future prosperity and job
security - although, apparently, also worried that interest rates are set to
rise. Meanwhile, the main yardstick of future economic activity - the
Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators - showed a 0.8
per cent rise for November, the biggest monthly advance since last January.
Glimpses into the future, however, were not universally positive. This spate
of encouraging economic data failed to translate into a traditional year-end
rally on Wall Street, largely because investors were also trying to
anticipate the tax changes which may take effect in 1993. The Clinton
administration, runs the thinking, will almost certainly increase the income
tax burden on high-earning individuals. Accordingly, such investors had
every incentive to lock into stockmarket profits before 1992 ended.
Tax-centred concerns have already led to the early payments of bonuses by
some Wall Street investment firms. Last week, these told on share prices, as
dealers reported confusing 'cross-currents' in trading activity. Some
investment clients, they suggested, were still buying on the economic news,
but others were busily selling on tax fears.
The two trends seemed to balance out and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
yo-yoed to the year's end - down a little at the start of the week, up a
little on Wednesday and Thursday, and then down sharply in 1992's final
half-hour of trading as computerised programme selling engulfed an otherwise
moribund market.
Still, even if short-term influences were mixed, the extent to which US
investors have been pinning their hopes - and their dollars - on 1993 were
evident when figures for mutual fund investment were published mid-week.
These showed a massive Dollars 9.9bn flowing into share-based funds in
November, way in excess of the previous monthly record of Dollars 7.5bn. As
a result, equity- oriented mutual funds have now pulled in a staggering
Dollars 68.6bn from investors in the first 11 months of 1992, almost double
the figure seen in the same period of 1991.
In one respect at least, investors' taste for equities and mounting optimism
over the economy, is irrefutably beneficial. Quite simply, it has helped
soak up equally unprecedented outflows from the corporate sector. Corporate
share and debt-related issues also rose to unprecedented levels last year -
over Dollars 800bn-worth of underwritten issues in the domestic market,
according to one calculation - as companies restructured their balance
sheets and took advantage of low interest rates.
But will the reality of 1993 live up to the hopes ? As analysts at S G
Warburg have pointed out, some of the more superficial portents are not
good. For a start, the year ends in a three - and statistically, over the
past 100 years, this ranks eighth out of the 10 choices. Secondly, a new
president will be in the White House, and post-election years have a
tendency to produce uninspiring stockmarket performance.
But down in Times Square, such qualms were speedily being put to rest.
'Happy New Year,' yelled a partying crowd, with a message which was simple
and would have cheered Wall Street's heart. Let the good times roll.

FT  02 JAN 93 / From Prussia with love: New Year's Day in Berlin, a plot is
hatched against sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVAGELY, Rathbone stamped his feet. The night was cold, growing colder.
High above the Brandenburg Gate, the moon glowed hazily, casting an eggshell
sheen across the clouds, as if a cosmic decorator had splattered a tin of
white paint around the Berlin sky.
The second day of January was a crazy time to call a board meeting of the
European Central Bank, Rathbone reflected fiercely. But then 2002 had been a
crazy year. And crazy men were running European money these days. They
talked of unity. Didn't they know everything was falling apart?
Rathbone gazed across the floodlit Reichstag square to the hulk of the bank
headquarters. Central, the staff called it. Their chairman, Mercator von
Stabil, had summoned the representatives of the 33 states making up European
monetary union to Berlin.
Impatiently crushing his cigarette, Rathbone pondered the events of the past
12 months. As the Bank of England's accredited observer at Central, he had
suffered a nerve-wracking time following the birth of the EuroMark at the
Potsdam Convention. Central had moved into the old Reichsbank building. The
Germans had chosen the shareholders. England was not among them. The Germans
were, after all, paying most of the bills. And the costs were mounting.
Forging monetary union among the 'Europe of 33' - stretching to Ukraine and
Konigsberg, down to Bulgaria across to Wallonia and Flanders, and then south
to Piedmont and Lombardy - had proved more onerous than expected.
Scotland, lured by the offer of Robert Burns's head on the smaller
denomination notes, had decided to join, not long after the 1999 Act of
Disunion. England had its consolation prize: observer status at Central,
thanks to its presidency of the Zweitesonderleistungsuntergruppe, the
Zslugs, which consisted of other peripheral nations such as Wales, Albania,
Moldova, Macedonia and Mezzogiorno.
Rathbone had moved to Berlin a year ago. In London, the Bank of England, now
independent, was shedding staff. Better a hard currency posting on Berlin
Station than fresh uncertainty in the City, his wife had said. A few weeks
later, she had left him for the Citibank options merchant with the liquid
crystal signet ring. With a spasm of anger, Rathbone recalled her parting
jibe. 'Once a field man, always a field man.'
Rathbone scanned his miniaturised range-forward directory. At Threadneedle
Academy, he had learned his trade well. Stealth. Intrigue. The long years in
Signals and Targeting; the cover-up techniques in Supervision.
He gripped his official pass, allowing him through the Central guardpost. He
had access to the Data Rooms. He could even attend lower-grade meetings,
where von Stabil and the others regarded him with the amused condescension
the English used to reserve for their butlers.
Rathbone's chief adversary was Gustav d'Exchange, the French managing
director, who dyed his hair and dropped puns from the corner of his mouth.
He did not need their sympathy. He had his wire taps. The infra-red sensors,
linked to the high-powered battery in his Jag. The network of microfilm
drops in no-man's-land. And then there was Sum. Rathbone's mouth moistened
at the thought of her.
The governor of the Bank of Estonia, a member of the Central board. He had
once asked Control, should he call her governess? Sum Fluuctuatin had won
acclaim for her currency model work at Tallinn. She liked Englishmen.
Especially, thin ones with a wounded look in their eyes. Who used to admire
the deft and elegant way she would slip into a more comfortable parity.
Sum's office on Central's executive suite shared a connecting door with von
Stabil's. Rathbone smiled mirthlessly. His secret - and hers. Control knew
more about what went on at Central than its own shareholders. It was almost
as if England had opted for monetary union after all.
Dawn crawled through the city's snow-covered towers and rooftops. Rathbone
watched the fleet of Mercedes drawing up outside Central. He counted to 33.
Then he moved fast, sheltered between the lumbering Diskontsatz, the
governor of the Bank of Slovakia, and old O'Flynn from the Vatican Bank. The
delegations jostled through the portals up to the sixth floor boardroom. A
huge chamber like a brightly-lit car park, hung with coloured blodges of
modern painting. Rathbone squeezed into one of the individually-tiled marble
lavatories, where governors were often closetted.
Rathbone gasped. Into the boardroom strolled a figure never before indicated
on Sum's computer lists: Rodney Slyde, the chief executive of the Bank of
England] Dimly, Rathbone could recall the old pre-independence governors:
noble characters of lordly bearing.
Turn to Page XVI
Tinker, tailor, soldier, currency speculator continued from page I
Slyde was not like them. He had a face like a young crocodile, and a nose
for business.
Slyde had made his name in privatisation. English banknotes, with the new
dragon motif, were now printed in Hong Kong. What in the name of Montagu
Norman was Slyde doing here?
On his ultra-sound intercept, Rathbone strained to pick up the conversation.
Von Stabil's accented words sent fear jangling through him. 'We are so
pleased, Mr Slyde, that you agree our little plan. We sell all our English
government bonds. The Commonwealth join us. Sterling sinks. We offer a
conversion rate. 1 Mark for 35 English pounds. You will have a seat on the
board] At last, true Europeans you will become] Your interest we have it, in
our hearts]'
Von Stabil's eyes glistened, a sea of cunning; his words took on a
pantomimic ring: 'The time, Mr Slyde, we must fix. I opine: January 6]'
Rathbone reeled. That day, the markets would be preoccupied by the Wise
Men's annual report. Central planned to take over the pound] To force
England into monetary union] To think that Slyde would descend to this
treachery]
Suddenly, a whiff of camphor told Rathbone he was no longer alone.
D'Exchange appeared in the doorway, flanked by Sellem Lowe, central's chief
trader, hired from the City's vilest currency pits.
'My dear Rathone,' intoned D'Exchange, 'You are well beyond your limits. At
this stage, intervention is obligatory]'
Rathbone winced at d'Exchange's nasal drawl. 'Lowe, deal with him]'
Grinning, Sellem drew his concealed hedging instrument. Crude. But highly
effective. Rathbone was aware of mist descending, as suddenly as the stop of
a heartbeat.
The throbbing became less insistent. He was in Swapp's Bar] His old haunt,
run by Karl Swapp, an ex-Polski Bank man, whose corpulent frame Rathbone
could now discern, oozing like a flow of lava from a battered armchair.
Sum must have dragged him here with the aid of Marginali, the southern bank
chief with a reputation for instability. Rathbone recognised the usual
crowd. There was Vendor, the out-of-work Belgian bond salesman. Bleache, the
sallow money laundering expert. Window, the Nederlandsche Bank functionary
whose all-too-open discounting facilities had caused such trouble]
Swapp rolled over. 'You haf problems, Mr Rathbone?' he inquired. 'I know
zese central bankers, zey all same. Since zey left gold standard, zey
drifting.'
Swapp spat: 'Zey want to get you down] To discredit you] Zey want to crush
your value]'
Weakly, Rathbone tried to realign his thoughts. He could try to make the
Embassy at Karlshorst, but the road would be under multilateral
surveillance. He could call up the old allies in Washington, but, of late,
Reserve had turned to reluctance. He must get on to Slyde] But a stifled
scream from Sum told him: again, too late]
'You always were a fool, Rathbone,' the chief executive purred, striding
into the dive, flanked by pink-coated henchmen. 'Of course, we do not act
alone. I am no more independent than the rest of them here. I was on the
phone to the government at Blenheim Palace this morning. Do not believe the
wording in the treaty. We all take instructions]'
Rathbone's brain flicked through all the training manuals he had ever read.
If there was a time for a U-turn, this was it] He pictured Sum beside him at
the Bank's safe house at Roehampton. All thought of rebellion ebbed away. He
took the girl's hand, and led her from the bar. No-one intervened.
Outside, the traffic stilled. The countdown had already started. At least,
they would never have to worry about exchange rates, any more.

FT  02 JAN 93 / A new year - and new realities: Barry Riley predicts that
there will be no easy ride in the securities market in his gloomy 1993
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE BEGIN 1993 with the bull market in UK equities now at a fairly mature
stage. Since the end of September 1990, when prices bottomed amid Gulf war
gloom and just ahead of the temporary euphoria of Britain's entry to the
European exchange rate mechanism, the All-Share index has climbed by 42 per
cent.
In the meanwhile, company profits have fallen and the British economy has
shrunk by about three per cent. Now the global economy is in trouble too,
especially in continental Europe where the internal problems of Germany are
spilling over to the rest of the European Community and beyond.
There is nothing surprising about this euphoria amid the gloom. It is the
way the cycle works. I can vividly remember the fuss 20 years ago on the day
that the stock market hit a new high and unemployment simultaneously reached
1m. One day early this year, the same could easily happen except that the
jobless figure will be 3m. But investors should be aware that by the time
serious economic recovery begins, the fun will probably be over for quite a
long time.
Pension funds have been able to rule off 1992 with their portfolios - mostly
of UK and overseas equities - showing an overall rate of return (capital
growth plus income) of some 19 per cent for the year. Given a rise in their
pay-linked liabilities of only five or six per cent, they have emerged
surprisingly well from a traumatic year.
However, the investment performance has been notably fragile, and has
depended entirely upon the resurgence since the end of August when the
markets began to anticipate the ERM capitulation. In four months, the
All-Share index has jumped by a quarter.
A second point to bear in mind is that pension fund actuaries do not take
much notice of market values. They look at dividends, which actually fell by
one per cent over 1992. The yield on the All-Share has declined to 4.3 per
cent against a long-run average of about five per cent. On this basis, the
pension funds are not doing particularly well. Nor is there any chance at
all that dividends will grow vigorously in 1993, because although company
profits should recover somewhat, first priority will be given to restoring
balance sheets and rebuilding dividend cover.
Conditions have been unusually favourable for equities in the UK during the
past few months. Short-term interest rates have come down sharply, and
long-term rates have eased too, partly because pressure from government
gilt-edged sales has been temporarily reduced as a side-effect of the
support for sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday.
Despite soaring share prices, there has been almost no supply of shares
through new issues. Pension fund managers have consequently been able to
dive back into a limited pool of equities and push prices up, which helps
their performance and their fees but which, as I have pointed out, does not
necessarily benefit the pension schemes themselves. There is scope here for
a dangerous overvaluation of the UK equity market which arguably has begun
to happen, with industrials selling on 17 times 1992 earnings, and might go
further in the early part of 1993.
A new year will bring new realities, however. Surely a great many companies
will seek to take advantage of the bull market by launching rights issues:
the banking and insurance sectors alone could soak up billions if they can
pluck up the nerve to ask their shareholders to pay for past blunders.
More importantly, the government's budget deficit looms above everything,
with requirements for gross gilt sales likely to reach Pounds 1bn a week
during 1993, and probably no less during 1994. Institutional cash flow runs
at about Pounds 40bn, so there are obvious gaps, presumably to be filled by
private investors or by foreigners.
There is little doubt that life insurance companies will divert most of
their cash flow of Pounds 25bn a year to UK government securities. This had
already started to happen by the third quarter of last year, when life
offices bought Pounds 4.3bn of gilts. But pension funds bought hardly any,
and indeed they now have such a weak cash flow that they have little
capacity to absorb gilts unless they make room in their Pounds 350bn
portfolios by selling existing holdings of equities.
As a first step, they can sell overseas equities, which may be one reason
why the UK market is becoming expensive by international standards. Later
on, the fear of an eventual funding crunch could increasingly overhang the
UK stock market, although any actual crisis is more likely to happen in 1994
rather than during the coming year.
To some extent, this general pattern was evident in the US in 1992, leading,
in fact, to an almost complete stalemate in which bullish and bearish forces
were just about perfectly balanced on Wall Street. But that was something of
a freak which is unlikely to be repeated in the UK. My central expectation
is that share prices in London will hit a high point early in 1993 and then
be subject to increasing pressures, although it may still be possible to
make money in recovery stocks and second-liners.
The problems will centre on one or two nasty moments as the Bank of England
seeks to price its gilt-edged auctions. In the 1970s, in similar
circumstances, the authorities resorted to interest rate manipulations in
order to tempt investor to buy gilts at supposedly unrepeatable interest
rates. This time around, the Grand Old Duke of York could possibly conduct
his main manoeuvres in the foreign exchange market as the Bank of England
endeavours to lure international investors into UK bonds, which they have
shunned since sterling was pulled out of the ERM.
A lot depends, of course, on the vigour of the British economy. A year ago,
I thought most of the forecasters were too optimistic; this year, I am
inclined to believe that, if anything, the short-term gloom is overdone,
although that is not the same as saying that I am optimistic.
There has been a substantial monetary stimulus, and money market interest
rates may well be cut to six per cent by the spring. But a simple
consumer-led recovery would quickly run into a brick wall in the foreign
exchange market. Back in the early 1980s, we could spend and borrow our way
out of the recession because there was a balance of payments surplus and the
private sector carried no more than an average debt burden. This time, we
are in a much deeper hole, and the recovery must be led by manufacturing or
it will not be sustainable.
For the time being, the French and the Germans are doing the UK a favour by
rendering their manufacturing sectors uncompetitive, and the renewed
strength of the dollar is helping, too. But for this kind of UK recovery to
happen, there needs to be a sharp rise in the domestic prices of
manufactured goods.
Even in a deep recession, there are powerful inflationary forces in the
British economy. Without inflation, it is hard to see any way out of the
crisis in the housing market and, without inflation, it will be hugely
expensive for the government to finance its borrowing binge. The temptation
for the government to engineer another sterling depreciation will grow. But
in those circumstances, investors might prefer to buy hard currency bonds
instead of gilts.
We can get out of the ERM but we cannot avoid exchange rate disciplines. So
do not expect an easy ride in the securities markets in 1993.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Bank staff sit personality tests: NatWest uses psychometrics
on life insurance sales recruits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1,500 National Westminster Bank staff have been recruited for the
bank's new life insurance sales subsidiary after undergoing personality
tests as part of the selection process.
Recruitment to NatWest Life, which is expected to become one of the 20
largest life insurers in Britain in its first year, has involved some of the
broadest uses of psychometric testing of employees yet seen in high street
banking.
Psychometric testing requires job applicants to answer questions designed to
test motivation and personality. Several banks, including Barclays and
Lloyds, are considering using the tests to select employees who are suited
to selling financial products. The banking code of practice introduced this
year places some restrictions on such selling.
Traditional bank recruitment has relied on clerical staff and managers
having obtained basic academic qualifications. Personality tests have been
thought irrelevant because bank staff have performed a mixture of office
tasks.
But NatWest Life, which is being launched this month with capital of Pounds
105m, has used psychometric tests and interviews to select its sales force.
About 1,500 have been recruited from the bank's branch network.
Mr Lawrence Churchill, chief executive of NatWest Life, said the subsidiary
had 'stronger requirements on personal qualities than for the average member
of branch staff'. It needed employees who were self-starting and sociable.
NatWest Life, 92.5 per owned by the bank, is a joint venture with Clerical
Medical. It is NatWest's first venture into offering tied insurance rather
than independent intermediary advice through NatWest Insurance Services.
The subsidiary will sell its own insurance products through 2,700 NatWest
branches. Its sales force will be divided into about 1,500 advisers selling
insurance, and 200 financial planning managers who will give other
investment advice.
The bank hopes NatWest Life will emulate the success of other clearing bank
subsidiaries selling tied insurance, including Lloyds Bank's Black Horse
Financial Services subsidiary, which sells Lloyds Abbey Life products.
Mr Churchill said it hoped to sell 200,000 policies in its first year. He
said NatWest believed insurance sales could eventually form 'a significant
proportion of profits'.
Most of the 1,500 sales staff have transferred from NatWest Insurance
Services.

FT  02 JAN 93 / PM warns Serbia on eve of peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARLORDS and political masters of the rival forces in the former
Yugoslavia prepared for a new round of peace talks in Geneva today as
international opinion hardened against Serbia.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, speaking in London, warned the Serbs that
the west was running out of patience with the lack of progress towards a
settlement.
There was sporadic small arms fire around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo
yesterday and there are indications that Bosnian Moslem forces are preparing
counter-attacks to dislodge Serb forces from their more exposed positions in
the hills south of the city.
Under pressure from Moslem forces, the Bosnian Serbs were again reported to
have defied UN no-fly rules to re-supply troops.
This was implicitly admitted by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, who said he had issued orders to ground all fixed-wing aircraft but
wanted to continue using helicopters to ferry wounded from battle areas.
General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN protection Forces (Unprofor)
in Bosnia, told a French radio station yesterday that he feared fighting
could flare up in Sarajevo in an attempt to undermine the Geneva talks. He
again called for a winter truce around the capital, which has been besieged
for months by Serb forces.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Major said sanctions might have to be both
tightened and stepped up dramatically, and that the 'complete and total
diplomatic isolation of Serbia' might also have to be considered.
'Serbia should understand very plainly the increasing impatience and despair
felt in the west at the way they have been behaving,' he said.
'Everyone to a certain extent is to blame for the present conflict but the
primary blame beyond a doubt in our mind, lies with the Serbs.
'They are the principal cause of the present conflict and people are getting
very impatient with that, not just us - the European Community collectively,
the US and others as well. I do not believe they should push that impatience
too far,' he warned.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Pit jobs worried cabinet in 1962: The contrasts over mine
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET papers released yesterday show a sharp contrast between the attitude
to pit closures of the Macmillan administration 30 years ago and the closure
programme announced by the government in October.
The Conservative leadership of 1962, which included one-nation Tories such
as Rab Butler and Iain Macleod, gave only qualified support to a plan to
close uneconomic pits. It urged the National Coal Board to consider fully
the social implications of closures.
In contrast, Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, said on
October 13 last year that 31 of Britain's 50 pits were to close with the
loss of 30,000 jobs. His announcement led to widespread claims of
insensitivity and a failure to grasp the human dimensions of the recession.
On July 5 1962, the cabinet discussed a memorandum by the chancellor of the
exchequer, Mr Selwyn Lloyd - now released under the 30-year rule - which
disclosed a plan by the NCB to break even over the five-year period 1963-67.
Demand for coal was estimated at 190m tons a year for several years ahead,
and the closure of uneconomic pits would have been necessary to meet
financial targets. In the previous year the board had maintained 162
collieries classed as 'gross losers' in the sense that their operating costs
exceeded the income from coal produced.
According to the chancellor, this strategy was 'economically sound, though
it would give rise to some social and political difficulties'. After a long
debate which showed widespread concern for the impact of pit closures on
mining communities, the cabinet agreed that the board's policy on closures
should receive qualified support.
It was proposed that in indicating the government's general approval,
Richard Wood, minister of power, should inform the NCB of ministers'
assumption 'that the board would, so far as possible, time their closures to
minimise the social difficulties which would result from them'.
It was added that the NCB's attention should be drawn to parts of the
country where these difficulties would be most acute.
The cabinet decided to maintain the policy of not allowing imports of US
coal. It agreed that any protests from the US administration over
inconsistencies between this policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade could be met by an assurance that the policy would be re-examined a
year later.

FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling underpinned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does seem a reasonably safe assumption is that by next summer the UK's
position relative to the rest of Europe will look very different. A recovery
of sorts should be under way and interest rates should have bottomed out.
There may even be expectations of a modest rise in rates which will underpin
sterling in the exchange markets. The combination of recovery and currency
stability may attract overseas money into UK equities and gilts, especially
if the Bundesbank is grudging in its rate cuts and the continent remains
mired in recession.
Even so, it would be foolish to assume that the government's funding
requirement will not restrain the equity market next year. The thought also
occurs that, in the absence of a vigorous recovery, the UK could easily
follow the pattern set by Wall Street, which showed its strongest gains
while interest rates were actually falling in late 1991. It has gained only
modestly since.
If that points to only small gains for equities as a whole this year, the
mood may swing violently at times, especially once the funding programme
gets under way in earnest in the spring. The best returns may accrue to
those nimble enough to move in and out of the market - and who, by luck or
judgment, enjoy an impeccable sense of timing.

By the time of the budget, attention may focus more strongly on the
government finances. Not only may tax increases seem by then inevitable. The
equity market will have to confront its greatest test of 1993: its ability
to compete against a gilt market in which the government will be raising
Pounds 1bn a week. The received wisdom is that, since government borrowing
needs exceed institutional cash-flow, gilt yields will have to rise to the
point where domestic investors switch out of equities on a large-scale.
The theory is so neat and so beguiling that it must to some degree be
suspect. Perhaps the government will, after all, decide to allow gilt sales
to banks to be counted as funding the PSBR. Perhaps it will borrow foreign
currencies abroad. Small savers may come to the rescue by switching out of
building society accounts and into equity and gilt-linked investments. The
recovery may be more robust than expected and the PSBR correspondingly
smaller.
None of these can count as sure predictions, but they are close enough to
the realm of the possible to serve as a reminder that the funding problem
need not turn out as dire as appears. Gilts and equity markets have been
aware of the 1993-94 funding requirement since the Autumn Statement. Both
have blithely ignored it so far.

FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Feeble growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury's expected growth rate is feeble for an economy emerging from
recession. It is only about half that achieved by the US last year in a
recovery that was far too weak to save President Bush from electoral defeat.
The equity market is thus taking a lot on trust. All the more so, since the
FT-SE index has risen by 33 per cent over the past two recessionary years
while reported industrial earnings have fallen by some 18 per cent.
That leaves the market on a historic multiple of over 17, a range not seen
since the run up to the 1987 crash. Arguably such a rating is justified on
the grounds that inflationary expectations have fallen. Low inflation
enhances the quality of earnings, enabling shares to trade on a higher
rating even though prospects for nominal earnings growth have diminished.
Yet there can be little mileage left in this argument. Any further advance
will need to be justified by actual earnings growth. This is notoriously
hard to predict. The devaluation should boost the income of companies which
derive most of their earnings from abroad. Those which are active in the US
may benefit additionally from recovery there - as well as further dollar
appreciation. But expectations of an anaemic UK recovery suggest earnings
growth may be confined to around 10 to 15 per cent this year.
Besides, low dividend cover will limit the beneficial impact of any earnings
rise. And the earnings trend will be unusually hard to pin down, given the
accounting changes now entering into force. The market may thus find itself
relying heavily on trading statements accompanying annual results to sustain
any new year rally.
The trouble is that there are plenty of other factors which could kill the
advance. If the chancellor means what he says, there is unlikely to be
another cut in rates in the first quarter, although base rates of 6 per cent
are probably factored into equity prices. Further deterioration of the
European economy - largely ignored by UK equities so far - will not help,
though it might hasten interest rate cuts in Germany. Another concern is
that the market's higher levels could provoke a spate of rights issues. This
would add to worries about institutional cash-flow. Rights issues last year
amounted to only Pounds 4bn against Pounds 10.3bn in 1991.

FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: New year ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year the dominant question for UK investors was whether
equities could continue to outperform bonds. The prospect of low inflation
and sluggish growth in the straitjacket of the ERM made it appear as though
gilts, for once, had the more sparkling future.
Since the UK's departure from the ERM in September, the debate has seemed
academic. Until then equities had enjoyed a total return of under 6 per cent
compared with 10 per cent for UK bonds. But the devaluation turned that on
its head. According to the WM Company, equities returned 20.6 per cent in
1992 as a whole, bonds only 15.5 per cent. Since devaluation paved the way
for economic recovery, equities should outperform again in 1993. There is a
danger, though, in overestimating the degree.
In theory the UK is now free to focus its economic policy on growth, while
the gilts market is likely to be weighed down with problems of oversupply.
The Treasury, however, is forecasting growth of only 1 per cent this year
and even the most optimistic City forecasts do not go much above 1.5 per
cent. As price pressures remain relatively muted, the UK is perhaps not
quite as far removed from the low growth, low inflation environment as might
have been expected after its dramatic exit from the ERM.

FT  02 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program selling hits Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
TRADING ended 1992 in quiet fashion, with a handful of economic statistics
giving little direction to the market, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
For most of Thursday the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted very modest
advances, having opened with a three-point gain and, aside from a brief
setback midday, holding on to this for most of the session. However, in the
last half-hour of trading, an unexpected spate of computer-guided program
selling developed and the index ended the session with a loss of 19.99 at
3301.11.
The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended the day with
decline, 3.10 to 435.72, although the American Stock Exchange rose 3.48 to
399.23. The Nasdaq composite increased by 5.10 to 676.95. Dealing volumes,
however, remained light on all markets, with the New York Stock Exchange
registering some 166.7m shares traded. Advances outweighed declines by
approximately two to one.
In early trading, the market's main focus was on further data suggesting
that the economy is recovering and that confidence is beginning to return.
The initial unemployment claims report for the week ended December 19 showed
an unexpectedly sharp fall of 28,000 to 332,000 - news which pushed down
bond prices but generally heartened the stock market. Later in the day, the
National Association of Purchasing Management's index for December -
accidently released four days early - also indicated further expansion in
the manufacturing economy.
There was a virtual dearth of corporate news, and even the mostly actively
traded stocks showed only narrow gains or losses. IBM, for example, added
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 50 3/8 , while Citicorp, the largest commercial
banking group, gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 . On the consumer
front, RJR Nabisco, the tobacco and food group, rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
8 5/8 , Philip Morris eased back by Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 77, and Coca-Cola
lost Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 . Amongst industrials, Westinghouse was
one of the more actively traded stocks, adding Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13
3/8 .
Some retail shares continued to climb, on thoughts that the holiday season
has been encouraging for US stores and that any revival in consumer
confidence will boost prospects further. J C Penney, for example, gained
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 77 3/4 , Dayton Hudson added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars
75 3/4
In the transportation sector, only one of the three big airline stocks ended
the year on a positive note; AMR gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 67 1/2 , but
UAL slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 126 1/8 while Delta Air Lines nudged
Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 50  7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO climbed in thin dealings on some year-end position-squaring and
short-covering, the TSE-300 index closing 23.6 higher at 3,350.4 in volume
of 26.1m shares valued at CDollars 182.7m, compared to 30m shares on
Wednesday.
The market ended 1992 some 4.6 per cent lower than a year ago. The TSE's
media and metals groups led gains.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE was mixed, after Pacific Rim markets ended the year on a positive
note.
PARIS saw arbitrage activity and block trading swell volume to some FFr3bn
in the last session of the year as the CAC-40 index closed just 0.99 lower
at 1,857.78. Among the actives were St Gobain, down FFr10 at FFr510, and
Paribas, losing FFr13.50 to FFr345.50.
Chargeurs and L'Oreal went against the trend with rises of FFr52 and FFr16
to FFr1,294 and FFr1,067 respectively.
MILAN moved privatisation stocks yet again, BCI rising L70 to L4,740 and
Credito Italiano L210 to L3,210 on the kerb after Wednesday's falls. The
general tone was more sombre as the Comit index declined 4.85 to 446.37.
MADRID saw weakness in construction as the general index eased 0.87 to
214.25. Dragados lost Pta 90 to Pta 1,220.
ISTANBUL, boosted by a new tax incentive measure, advanced 48.65 to 4,004.18
in turnover of some TL168bn.
TEL AVIV ended the year 96 per cent higher than it began, the market index
adding 1.79 at 195.97 on Thursday.
HONG KONG was firmer on year-end window dressing in quiet half-day trading.
The Hang Seng index gained 44.50 at 5,512.39 in turnover of HKDollars
1.14bn. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.94 to 1,524.40 in
volume of 46.6m shares. Among the actives, SIA Foreign climbed 60 cents to
SDollars 18.50, Singapore Press Foreign put on 40 cents at SDollars 15.90
and F &amp; N gained 20 cents at SDollars 11.40.
MANILA was encouraged by PLDT's strong performance in New York and the
composite index moved up 15.21 to 1,256.22 in turnover of 409m pesos. PLDT
rose 25 pesos to 870 and Philippine National Bank closed 5 pesos up at 230.
KUALA LUMPUR rose on interest in speculative stocks as the composite index
gained 1.30 at 643.96. Turnover was estimated at MDollars 135m.
AUSTRALIA closed at a three-month high but in low volume. The All Ordinaries
index added 11.8 at 1,549.9.

FT  02 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe underperforms as currency crises
bite - A look at 1992, and prospects for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a foretaste of what to expect this year, the events of 1992 were totally
unhelpful. Twelve months ago, I argued that currency stability and economic
convergence within Europe necessitated a radical re-think of portfolio
management. I argued that, in order to achieve efficient diversification,
investors based in Europe needed to decrease, rather than increase, their
exposure to EC stock markets.
The theory still holds. The problem, however, is that there is now an even
bigger question mark over the extent to which currency stability and
economic convergence can be achieved within the EC. The events of 1992 will
have served to rule these out as automatic, long-term assumptions in the
minds of investors.
Ironically, it is currency instability, both within and without Europe,
which will have sorted out the winners from the losers last year.
The French market, for example, gave only a modest return (6 per cent). UK
investors in that market never-theless enjoyed a 24 per cent sterling
return, thanks to the relative strength of the franc.
The reverse holds, of course. French investors in the UK market earned less
than 3 per cent, in contrast to the 20 per cent earned by UK investors in
their own market.
It was the strength of the US dollar against most major currencies which
really transformed international equity returns in 1992. And, while the
assumptions underlying my diversification theory may have collapsed,
European investors who did increase their stake in Wall Street would have
benefited substantially. The return on the US market itself (9 per cent) may
have been modest, but the dollar return earned overall would have far
surpassed this.
All this is already history. A fresh start can be made on Monday morning,
although decision-making is going to be no easier in 1993, especially taking
into account the strains and stresses within the European Community.
Nor is the general economic outlook for Europe any reason for optimism. The
fall in sterling and interest rates should fuel some modest growth in the UK
this year; elsewhere, however, the news becomes gloomier by the month,
particularly in Germany.
Further abroad, anyone reading Emiko Terazono's recent article (Financial
Times, December 29) can only have been drawn to the conclusion that another
painful and volatile year also lies ahead in Japan.
The Tokyo stock market may have found a bottom, thanks to government
support, but it would be only realistic to assume that pent-up selling
pressure will continue to delay the very long haul back to peak 1989 levels.
Cheerier news is emerging from the US, where the economy appears to be
gaining momentum at last. But, even there, considerable uncertainties
prevail, not least as to how the incoming administration intends to sustain
recovery, while being seen to tackle structural deficit and debt problems.
The bottom line is that we are still in an economic mess. And the
cleaning-up process will be far from easy. There is also a considerable
danger that quick fixes will be found instead of long-term solu-tions, given
political pressures worldwide.
The only safe prediction to make for 1993, it seems, is that the volatility
of currency and equity markets will remain exceptionally high.
It also seems that UK-based investors will have more to cope with than many
of their international counterparts. While I am sure Mr Lamont will have
consulted his Wise Men over the festive period, it is difficult to believe
that the U-turns and bumblings which were such features of 1992 will
suddenly stop.
This view may be far too parochial, now that we have all become European
citizens. On the other hand, that may not happen effectively until the UK
has ratified the Treaty.

FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US gives lift to drug shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US authorities on Thursday delivered a year-end boost to the
pharmaceutical sector, granting approval to four products from UK companies
and sending shares in the recipient groups leaping smartly forward.
Of these, Fisons shares responded with the biggest percentage advance after
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had approved the
group's Tilade asthma product.
Fisons said it intended selling the drug probably by the middle of 1993. The
market was also cheered by the company's announcement that it had agreed a
marketing arrangement for Tilade in the US with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Fisons,
which will also co-promote Azmacort, RPR's steroid asthma treatment, in the
US, said the two drugs play a complementary role in contributing to the
successful treatment of asthma. The stock jumped 15 to 245p.
However, analysts cautioned against expecting any short-term benefit for
Fisons' earnings, arguing that the asthma treatment market was conservative
and that the marketing costs were likely to be high. But they also added
that the drug, one of the brightest hopes in Fisons' armoury, should help
turn round sentiment in the stock, which has suffered several setbacks in
the past year.
Boots received approval from the FDA for its Manoplax heart failure
treatment and the shares climbed 12 to 561p. Observers warned that, while
this was positive news, the drug's effect could be limited by the fact that
it was likely to be used in conjunction with other drugs, and not just on
its own. Manoplax received official blessings from UK authorities in August.
The third recipient of FDA approval was SmithKline Beecham, which won
consent for its Paxil anti-depressant treatment. The drug is seen as one of
the most important developments for the group.
Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals analyst at Nikko Europe, said: 'Since the
merger of the two companies and the consequent short-term benefits, the
market has been looking for something which would give the combined group
organic growth. Paxil is the one which will provide a basis for that.'
Analysts also added that Paxil was likely to be marketed at a discount to
rival Prozac in the US. Prozac, the market leader in anti-depressants,
manufactured by Eli Lilly, had sales of Dollars 550m in 1992 and was
expected to have sales of Dollars 600m in 1993.
SmithKline forged ahead 20 on the announcement before retreating to close at
496p, a rise of 12 on the day.
Amersham also received the FDA blessing for its Indiclor cancer treatment
and the stock advanced 17 to 619p.
Elsewhere in the sector, Glaxo, which gained FDA approval for its Imigran
drug on Tuesday, added 8 at 793p, while Wellcome moved forward 5 to 967p.
Worries continued over a price war between Britain's supermarkets. J.
Sainsbury had announced on Wednesday that it would cut prices on selected
items to combat similarly planned price promotions from the rival Tesco and
Argyll - which owns Safeway - chains. After tumbling heavily that day,
downward pressure continued on most of the stocks on Thursday, although
volumes were predictably thin.
Argyll slipped 5 to 393p, Kwik Save weakened 11 to 773p and Tesco softened 2
to 249p. After an initial decline, Sainsbury rallied to close 3 ahead on
balance at 564p.
Food manufacturers, which had suffered on the back of the Sainsbury move on
Wednesday, recovered some ground. United Biscuits improved 3 to 355p and
Tate &amp; Lyle 2 to 403p, while Associated British Foods appreciated 6 to 509p
and Cadbury-Schweppes ended 5 better at 444p.
Buttressed by Wall Street's firmness the previous night, leading oil issues
maintained the solid improvement of recent sessions, although business was
thin.
British Petroleum, 3 ahead at 247p, continued to benefit from hopes that
both the US dollar and global crude oil prices would rise in the new year.
But BP has been included in the market's list of probable rights issuers in
1993 and buying was muted.
Shell Transport fully sustained its status as one of the market's most
favoured stocks, although in the thin holiday trading conditions the shares
could manage to gain only 3 at 562p.
North Sea stocks had a quiet half-day session, with Enterprise Oil unable to
move from the overnight quotation of 441p. Enterprise has also found favour
in the stock market and is expected to respond readily to any signs of
increased activity in global economies, which would help crude oil prices.
Granada Group, one of the stocks tipped for a recovery buy in 1993,
continued its recent surge, appreciating 13 to 376p. Thorn EMI joined in the
recovery story, leaping 21 to 881p.
Holiday groups, heartened all week by reports of buoyant bookings, moved
higher. Owners Abroad put on 2 1/2 at 96 1/2 p, while Eurocamp gained 4 at
312p.
House builders continued to respond to reports that estate agents' business
had picked up in December. Bilton climbed 6 to 396p, Bellway 7 to 318p,
Bryant Group 4 to 108p, Persimmon 6 to 221p and Wilson Bowden 12 to 396p.
Selected stores shares again benefited from the reports of firm high street
sales. Austin Reed 'A' added 3 at 111p, Kingfisher 2 at 591p and Marks and
Spencer 1 1/2 at 329 1/2 p.
Others, however, ran into a bout of profit-taking. Ratners retreated 2 3/4
to 12 3/4 p, Storehouse 4 to 202p and Dixons Group 4 to 259p.

FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST IN the London derivatives markets was very thin on New Year's Eve
but stock index futures continued to hold a good premium against the cash
market, writes Terry Byland.
Traders said optimism for economic recovery in the new year remained solid,
encouraged by favourable comments from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor
of the exchequer, and from the British business community.
At the close of the half-day trading session, the March contract on the
FT-SE Index showed a premium of 20 against the cash market - a premium of
about eight above fair value, the calculation which allows for dividend and
financing flows on the underlying blue chip stocks.
Earlier, the future ran to a premium of 30 against cash, but both
institutional and independent traders were unwilling to chase the future any
higher ahead of the holiday weekend. Trading volume was a mere 1,688
contracts.
In traded options, similar holiday factors prevailed. Business dropped to
8,691 lots from Wednesday's 21,718, with the FT-SE contract trading only
2,767, against a previous 8,801. The active stocks list was headed by BP
(805 contracts), and US regulatory moves encouraged Glaxo (521) and Fisons
(445). BTR, on 771 lots, also attracted interest.

FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed confidence as the year ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market moved confidently to the close of trading for 1992,
as optimistic messages from British industry lifted the FT-SE Index on New
Year's Eve to within a couple of points of the year's high. Share volume for
the half-day session was modest but business picked up in the final hour of
trading when equity prices moved ahead.
The final reading showed the Footsie at 2,846.5 for a gain of 14 points on
the overnight figure. The final Seaq total of 228.9m shares for the
half-session compared favourably with normal trading experience. On
Wednesday, retail equity business was worth only Pounds 797.4m. Over 1992,
the FT-SE Index has gained around 14.2 per cent, with the final quarter
bringing a dramatic response to the untimely departure of sterling from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Equities opened firmly behind the previous night's Wall Street strength, but
the day's peak of 2,846.7 was soon lost in the absence of institutional
interest. However, an important batch of drug approvals by the US regulatory
authorities kindled interest in leading pharmaceutical issues and provided
the final boost.
There was little further progress among the retail shares, where
confirmation of the apparent buoyancy of the Christmas trading period was
keenly awaited. The price-cutting round inspired among food retailers by
supermarket group J. Sainsbury depressed some high street names.
UK business organisations - including the Confederation of British Industry
 -and also Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, expressed
optimism for the UK economy in the new single market in the EC.
By New Year's Eve, retail business in equities had begun to recover from
pre-Christmas sloth as some funds anticipated a further advance.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: An uncertain new year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 period will probably go down as one of the most volatile years of
currency trading since the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates
collapsed in the early 1970s, writes James Blitz.
In spite of the quiet trading of recent weeks, however, there is no reason
to suppose that 1993 will bring a sustained period of calm.
For most of the last 12 months, dealers in foreign exchange markets have
been obsessed with two burning questions: is the US set for a sustained
economic recovery? And will the Bundesbank seriously ease German monetary
policy?
The first question is finding answers. Every new day brings evidence that
the US economy is set to grow this year. This week, the US consumer
confidence index rose to 78.3 per cent in December from 65.6 per cent the
previous month. The leading indicators jumped to 0.8 per cent in November
from October's 0.5 per cent.
But the market is as divided over the Bundesbank's intentions as ever. The
case for expecting an early easing in monetary policy - and a weakening of
the D-Mark - is strong. According to the Ifo institute, Germany is set for a
0.5 per cent fall in GDP this year. In these circumstances, the Bundesbank
has strong reasons to cut interest rates early in the 1993 first quarter.
'Failure to do so will intensify the extent of the economic slump in
Germany, as well as breaking the current parity structure in the exchange
rate mechanism,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in
London.
The spectre of inflation and high monetary growth, however, still hangs over
the German central bank. In the spring, few economists would have believed
that a  1/4 percentage-point cut in the Lombard rate was all that the
Bundesbank would yield by New Year's Day. And even now, it can be argued
that monetary easing is as far off as ever.
The market was excited by the Bundesbank president's pre-Christmas comment
that long-term interest rates could fall to 6 per cent by the end of 1993.
But one European central banker said this week that bond dealers would only
trade lower long-term rates if they believed the central bank had definitely
cracked the inflationary spiral - which may only happen if Germany's
short-term rates remain high.
He added: 'This Bundesbank president does not want to go down in history as
the one who prematurely succumbed to pressure to relax the reins on monetary
supply.'
As in the case of 1992, the 1993 year may be all about guessing how - and
when - the Bundesbank will turn.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Money Markets: New view on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT weeks, sterling dealers have been bullish about the prospect for
another cut in UK base rates, but the market finished 1992 in an uncertain
mood, writes James Blitz.
For the first half of the past week, dealers were convinced that another
easing of monetary policy before the spring was certain.
Reports of large numbers of people rushing to the shops to get end-of-year
bargains suggested that the pressure might have come off the government to
ease policy in order to stimulate the economy. So, too, did signs of
increased business confidence in the last days of the year.
The evidence, however, was ignored. The March short sterling contract peaked
at 93.52 on Wednesday night.
This suggested that three-month money in the spring will be as low as 6.48
per cent, a level compatible with 6 per cent base rates.
Thursday saw a sharp reversal of sentiment in the futures market. In part,
this was due to a feeling that the March contract had been oversold.
One clearing bank dealer talked of how most of the buying on the floor of
LIFFE over the Christmas period had been done by one broker. 'We have
started to think that he may be talking the futures up too much,' he said.
Another factor was a newspaper interview given to The Times by the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, in which he appeared to rule out the
possibility of base rate reductions.
According to the text of the interview, the chancellor gave an emphatic 'no'
in response to a question about whether there could be any expectation of a
change in interest rates if the Treasury's forecast of a 1 per cent recovery
next year became reality.
The report of these remarks helped to push March short sterling down 10
basis points on New Year's Eve to a close of 93.42.
However, the reversal in futures may not have been justified. Treasury
officials pointed out on the day of publication of the interview that output
and growth are not being targeted as the sole indicator of economic
performance, as was implied.
The Treasury says it will not judge the effect of its policies until they
have worked through the economy. Other indicators, apart from growth, will
also be watched.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Commodities (Year in the Markets): Prices end back at square
one after another turbulent year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL and RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and continued turbulence in the former Soviet Union have left
commodity prices little changed at the end of the year from those seen last
January. But that bald statement belies the level of activity in the
markets.
On the London Metal Exchange the flood of imports from the former Soviet
Union pushed nickel prices sharply down and kept a firm lid on the aluminium
market, where warehouse stocks now stand above 1.5m tonnes. The zinc market
suffered a classic squeeze. Copper, still traded in sterling, appears to
have risen sharply until the figures are converted to dollars - around
Dollars 1 a lb looks set to be the going rate this January as last.
Gold has fallen further, hit by an almost total lack of interest from
investors. Both platinum and silver have continued to settle into their
relatively new roles as industrial metals.
Cocoa and coffee prices have touched their lowest levels for 20 years or
more before recovering. The lack of activity in the sugar market has left
London with virtually no futures trading.
Gold fell to a six-year low in late March as it crashed through what many
traders had seen as the last line of defence - Dollars 342 a troy ounce.
Persistent selling, some of it thought to be on behalf of an eastern
European central bank, coincided with Ramadan, the Islamic fast, which kept
most Middle Eastern operators away from the market.
By Easter gold was at a fresh low of Dollars 336.80 a troy ounce, with
dealers predicting that the price was bottoming out. They were proved right
for a time as the market started to climb, brushing aside an announcement by
the Belgian central bank that it had sold 202 tonnes from its reserves.
Platinum was also rising as South African unrest made users reluctant to go
short in case of a miners' strike. In July the platinum price hit the year's
high of just over Dollars 390 a troy ounce. But some analysts pointed out
that the market was ignoring weak demand from Japan and continuing recession
in the US.
Gold reached its peak for the year of just under Dollars 360 a troyounce a
few days after platinum - and then both markets slid steeply, leaving one
analyst just two weeks later describing Dollars 355 for gold as 'like the
Matterhorn'. On one mid-August day gold fell by more than Dollars 8 and
platinum by Dollars 16 a troy ounce.
The withdrawal of US investment funds sparked the gold fall, which was
exacerbated by more news of central bank selling - this time from Uruguay,
which unloaded 50,000 troy ounces in July in order to buy fixed term
deposits denominated in US dollars and D-marks. Platinum slid along with the
Japanese equity market.
The European currency market jitters of September gave some support to gold,
but South African and Australian producers were able to lock in profits in
their own currencies through forward selling. Gold has not had a good year;
Middle East sales in November finished the battering from central bank sales
and the total lack of investor interest and took the market to a 7-year low
of Dollars 329.30. It has not made much headway since, closing at Dollars
333.05 a troy ounce on Thursday, down about Dollars 20 on the year.
Platinum ended the year at Dollars 355.25 a troy ounce, some Dollars 20
above its price at the beginning of the year. Optimism about a recovery in
Japanese demand and positive charts point to further gains, analysts
believe.
Silver hit an 18-month low of 364.75 cents at the end of August and closed
at 367.5 on Thursday, 20 cents down on the year. The biggest excitement of
the year was the Saudi sale via the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah of
Dollars 160m-worth of silver - equivalent to more than 10 per cent of world
demand - in just two hours early in July, knocking more than 20 cents off
the price.
Like most of the base metals copper began the year in a fairly hopeful mood.
Chilean strike fears and technical factors had helped to lift prices to 2
1/2 -month highs by mid-February, before some of the gains were relinquished
in response to reports that Russia, hungry for hard curency, was planning to
cut export duties on the metal. In the spring talk of Chinese buying was
partly counteracted by concern about the effects of a possible strike in
Germany, one of the biggest importers of copper, but as London Metal
Exchange warehouse stocks began to be reduced and US recovery hopes started
to grow prices climbed to 12-month highs by mid-June.
Bullish sentiment continued - fuelled by concern about supply tightness,
Polish labour tension, bad weather in Chilean producing areas and expected
demand growth - and a month later copper prices stood at the highest level
for 18 months.
From that point the picture becomes blurred by sterling's extreme weakness
against the US dollar, in which base metals are traded worldwide. The effect
of the pound's decline, most of which was concentrated in the dramatic
mid-September devaluation, on copper prices is illustrated by the fact that
the two-year sterling high reached in early November equated to a nine-month
dollar low. And that factor has continued to dominate the market.
The three months copper price closed on Thursday at Pounds 1,538 a tonne,
Pounds 350 up on the year. But once the currency disportion is stripped out
the 12-month advance comes down to a much less impressive Pounds 78 a tonne.
For lead, the LME's other sterling-denominated contract, the devaluation
effect is even more pronounced, turning what would have been a Pounds 60
fall into an apparent Pounds 8 rise on the year, at Pounds 308.75 a tonne
for three months metal.
After a flat start to the year, depressed by sluggish car battery sales, the
LME lead market found support in production problems, notably in Italy and
Yugolslavia, followed by signs of a technical squeeze on nearby supplies and
reports of Chinese buying. Between them, and helped by the pound's weakness,
these factors lifted the lead market to a 12-month peak in July. And that
was exceeded in the September as a direct result of sterling's plunge. By
the end of November, however, the market's fundamental weakness had been
reasserted and prices were back to five-month lows.
Another LME market to feel the effects of a squeeze this year was zinc.
Signs of the coming technical suppy tightness were apparent from the start
of the year, though they tended to be obscured by the effects of production
problems in Italy, Peru, Canada, Mexico and the US, among others. Hopes of a
US retail upturn were also cited as zinc prices reached 15-month highs in
March.
But from then on the squeeze was the undoubted dominant factor. The normal
'contango' situation, with the cash price at a discount to forward
positions, was reversed in late March and the 'backwardation', as a cash
premium is known, widened inexorably until it reached an extraordinary
Dollars 189 a tonne in the middle of June.
In normal circumstances a backwardation would suggest a shortage of metal
available for delivery, but that hardly fitted in with this year's sustained
rise in LME warehouse stocks of zinc, which, by the time the cash premium
appeared, had grown from 152,000 tonnes at the start of the year to 221,000
tonnes. It was clear, therefore, that some sort of distortion (not to say
manipulation) was afoot. The exchange responded by imposing a descending
ceiling on the one-day backwardation  - ie on the cost of carrying forward a
short position for one day. The backwardation had disappeared by the end of
July, though it made frequent reappearances before the squeeze, suspected to
be the work of a group of producers, could confidently be said to be over in
early October.
With fundamental considerations taking over direction of the market and the
rise in LME stocks continuing the ensuing price slide saw the three months
price retreat some Dollars 300 from its summer level to end the year at
Dollars 1,079.50 a tonne, down Dollars 35.50 on balance.
The aluminium market had been weighed down in 1991 by the unprecedented
growth of the stockpile in LME warehouses, which began 1992 by passing the
unwelcome milestone of 1m tonnes. There were hopes that the flood of metal
from the former Soviet Union that had been largely responsible for swelling
LME stocks would soon abate, especially in view of the inefficiency of
smelters in the newly independent republics and their much-vaunted espousal
of market economics. But the republics' hunger for hard currency proved
greater than their commitment to industrial efficiency and with CIS exports
remaining very high the LME stockpile grew by another 500,000 tonnes.
Perhaps surprisingly, the market took this pretty much in its stride and the
three months LME price ended the year Dollars 110 to the good at Dollars
1,260.50 a tonne.
Gains early in the year were mostly lost in the summer as hopes of economic
recovery faded and the gloomy truth about CIS export prospects became
apparent. But in the latter part of the year the market was encouraged by
the announcement of production cuts.
The biggest loser on the LME last year was nickel. The mood was bright
enough early on as traders looked forward to big production cuts in response
to the low price level and, as with aluminium, a slackening of CIS exports.
The former came too late, however, and the latter came not at all, and the
six-month highs seen in February proved to be the year's peak.
By the time Inco of Canada instituted a round of output cuts in October
nickel prices had fallen to two-year lows and LME stocks of the metal had
risen by 300 per cent on the year so far to nearly 50,000 tonnes. In those
circumstances the market was looking for an upturn in demand, especially in
the stainless steel sector, to give it the necessary shot in the arm, not
simply a reduction in output. Further production cuts were subsequently
announced by Falconbridge of Canada, Cuba's state-run producer and Western
Mining of Australia - amounting in all to nearly 38,00 tonnes in a full year
 -but the price slide continued and LME three months nickel closed on
Thursday at Dollars 6,023 a tonne, down Dollars 1,192 on the year.
By comparison, the tin market had a good year. LME stocks rose by only 7.4
per cent to 14,710 tonnes and the three months price ended 1992 up Dollars
240 at Dollars 5,845 a tonne.
A life-of-contract low of Dollars 5,485 had been registered at the beginning
of the year but by mid-February the market was at a six-month high,
reflecting concern about shipment delays from Brazil and Malaysia, the two
biggest suppliers. The bullish mood continued throughout the first half,
lifting the price to a 25-month high of Dollars 6,950 a tonne, before a
reaction was caused by Brazilian and Chinese selling and bearish technical
factors. But the market was moving higher again before the new year,
encouraged by buying in Kuala Lumpur and activity in the options market.
For the oil market in general 1992 proved a disappointing year and for
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries a worrying one.
Having started at the low level of about Dollars 17 a barrel the Brent crude
price was buoyed in the spring by optimism about the prospects for demand
when the expected industrial recovery began. And the price moved above
Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time in six months when Opec ministers
agreed unexpectedly in May to roll over its second quarter production
ceiling of 22.98m b/d into the third quarter, rather than anticipate the
rise in demand.
But by November, in the absence of the expected demand boost, the market was
looking for Opec ministers to agree substantial production cuts at their
meeting in Vienna. When this did not happen prices fell sharply and it took
the political turmoil in Russia, the world's biggest producer, to lift Brent
crude back above Dollars 18 a barrel last month.
Of the softs, cocoa began the year in the most optimistic mood as the market
looked forward eagerly to the first annual supply deficit for eight years.
But, with collapsing demand from the former Soviet Union, hopes of higher
prices proved to be a pipe dream, with the market failing to regain the 1991
peak of Pounds 829 a tonne.
The second postion contract on London Fox opened the year at Pounds 745 a
tonne. The market continued an almost unbroken decline for the next six
months. The nadir came at the end of June, when the second position contract
fell to Pounds 509 a tonne, the lowest level for more than 16 years. At
these levels countries of origin, including the Ivory Coast, were reluctant
to sell, and were also pinning some hope on the outcome of Geneva talks on a
new international agreement.
The market began a slow climb back to more than Pounds 750 a tonne in early
November, given a boost by sterling's devaluation and an Ivory Coast
decision to ban the sale of small beans. But London prices have ended close
to Pounds 700 a tonne, and it is worth noting that the nearby New York
contract which began the year at Dollars 1,245 a tonne, closed it at Dollars
936.
The Economist Intelligence Unit is predicting a small deficit of 43,000
tonnes for 1992-93, while the US Agriculture Department estimates production
and supply in balance at 2.35m tonnes. The EIU expects the next round of
talks on a cocoa pact in February to end with a purely administrative pact,
and is predicting prices to average about the same as in 1991 at 55 cents a
lb.
Coffee prices, like cocoa, went into a steep slide from the beginning of the
year. The London robusta market fell by more than Dollars 300 to hit 22-year
lows at the beginning of May. The high level of consumer stocks - 19m bags
(60 kg each) - left producers with little option but to sell for what they
could get.
Throughout the summer the market edged higher, keeping an eye on the
International Coffee Organisation's interminable negotiations on a new
international agreement. The different supply and demand picture for
robustas and arabicas kept London steady while New York arabicas went below
50 cents a lb in September.
But by the end of October both markets were rallying strongly as traders
enjoyed a total change in sentiment, mainly on perceptions of a smaller
1992-93 crop in Brazil, the biggest producer, and Colombia. In December,
London's second position robusta contract broke through the Dollars 1,000 a
tonne level for the first time since January 8.
The EIU believes the recent rise has been overdone. Consumer stocks are
still high and this month's ICO talks are likely to be inconclusive, pushing
a new coffee agreement back to 1994.
The centre of gravity for world sugar prices has moved decisively from
London to New York, where speculative money provides liquidity. The second
position New York raw sugar futures contract has ranged between 8 and 10
cents a lb throughout the year - another market with more than enough
production to satisfy demand. For much of the last few months the market has
been stuck between 8.5 and 9 cents - a narrow range with depressingly low
traded volumes, according to ED &amp; F. Man's latest sugar report. But this
contrasted with increased volumes of freely traded sugar following the
dissolution of the Cuban trading arrangements with Comecon, Man pointed out.
A November report from the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation predicted
trade expansion for sugar, but believed that by the turn of the century
prices would still be about 10 cents a lb in 1990 terms.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banque Indosuez sets up FFr600m
HQ leaseback
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French investment bank which has been one of the most
prominent casualties of the Paris property crisis, has concluded a FFr600m
(Dollars 109m) sale and leaseback deal for its headquarters with an unnamed
French bank.
The leaseback deal, which should produce a profit of almost FFr600m, follows
shortly after Suez, the French industrial and financial group that owns
Indosuez, announced that it was pumping FFr900m into the bank in a
recapitalisation package intended to compensate for the losses on its
property portfolio.
The precarious state of the Paris property sector emerged as a serious
problem last year for a number of French financial institutions. Paris
property has been in the doldrums for three years, during which average
rentals have fallen by 20 per cent.
As a result many of the banks and insurance companies, which are the main
investors in the market, have taken significant losses on their property
holdings.
Indoseuz alone saw its net profits for the first half of 1992 fall to just
FFr82m from FFr517m in the same part of 1991 after it was forced to treble
its provisions to FFr1.39bn.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman of Indosuez, said at the time that
he hoped to avoid making a loss for the full year. The proceeds of the
leaseback of the bank's grandiose head office on Boulevard Haussmann should
eradicate that risk.
The transaction will also bolster Suez, which has been hit by the property
problems of Banque La Henin, another subsidiary. The deal comes while Suez
is under pressure from Union des Assurances de Paris, the largest French
insurer which is one of its biggest shareholders, over the latter's
unsuccessful attempts to acquire control of Colonia, one of Suez's German
subsidiaries.
A number of French companies have recently negotiated sale and leaseback
deals as part of capital-raising exercises.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Court ruling clears way for
Arnotts takeover bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit maker fighting a hostile takeover bid from
Campbell Soup, the US food group, said it would appeal against a court
ruling invalidating a 1985 shareholding agreement.
The judgment, delivered by the New South Wales supreme court on Thursday,
clears the way for Campbell to pursue its ADollars 8.80 a share offer, which
values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (Dollars 827m).
Campbell, which already owns 32.9 per cent of Arnotts, is seeking a further
17.2 per cent for majority control, but has offered to buy all the 67.1 per
cent of the shares it does not own.
Arnotts argued that the agreement between the companies prevented Campbell
from voting more than 14.5 per cent of the stock or appointing a majority of
directors unless it acquired more than 85 per cent of the shares.
However, Justice Windeyer ruled that the agreement was valid only while
Campbell's shareholding remained below 40 per cent, freeing Campbell to seek
control of Arnotts.
The agreement was drawn up in 1985 when Campbell took a friendly
shareholding in Arnotts as part of its defence against an unwelcome takeover
bid by Mr Alan Bond.
The judge said the agreement was intended to prevent Campbell from seizing
control of Arnotts without paying for it. He said the agreement had no
bearing on a full takeover offer.
Campbell delayed the closing date for its offer by two weeks in response to
the ruling. The offer, which is with shareholders, will now expire on
January 28.
Analysts say Campbell may have to raise its bid, following suggestions by
the two largest institutional shareholders that the offer price was too low.
An independent report commissioned by Arnotts valued the group at a minimum
of ADollars 10.78 a share. The shares closed at ADollars 9.20 on the
Australian Stock Exchange on Thursday.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: French insurers top active list
for cross-border deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH insurers have been the most active in European cross-border expansion
while Italy has been the country most frequently targeted, according to a
survey by Tillinghast, the management consultants and actuaries.
The survey lists 201 cross-border initiatives between 1987 and 1991, of
which French companies were responsible for 54.
The favoured targets of the initiating companies were the developing markets
of Italy (48) and Spain (25), while 29 of the new initiatives favoured
France.
British companies were responsible for 45 initiatives, although only 14 have
taken place in 1990 and 1991, and several of the earlier initiatives, such
as those taken by Guardian Royal Exchange in Italy in 1989, have already
unwound.
Swiss companies took 31 initiatives, Italian companies 17 and German
companies 15.
The technique most favoured in cross-border initiatives was acquisition  -
either outright or by building up a stake.
Genuine co-operative agreements such as the merger between Amev of the
Netherlands and Groupe AG of Belgium, were rare.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Novell rallies ally for software
war - A look at preparations to challenge Microsoft's expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the US networking software company, is positioning itself for what
may become the computer software marketing battle of the decade, with its
planned acquisition of AT&amp;T's Unix Systems Laboratories.
Novell is on a collision course with Microsoft, reigning champion of the
software industry, in a fight to establish the dominant software system for
the next generation of networked computer systems.
Currently, Novell is the leading supplier of software that manages the
communications between computers linked on networks. Microsoft, however,
leads the market for personal computer operating systems.
The functions of operating systems and network management systems are,
however, beginning to overlap and the trend is expected to accelerate when
Microsoft next year launches 'Windows NT' a new version of its popular
personal computer operating system that incorporates network management
functions.
What is more, Microsoft has ambitions way beyond the desktop computer. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, has made no secret of
the fact that with Windows NT he aims to address a broader segment of the
computer market, including classes of computers that run the Unix operating
system.
Thus Novell's acquisition of Unix represents a move to counter Microsoft's
anticipated attack. By putting its marketing muscle behind Unix, Novell aims
to accelerate the adoption of the AT&amp;T developed operating system and
reinforce its role as an 'industry standard'.
Yet with the acquisition of USL, Novell will also inherit a history of
feuding over Unix which began in the mid-1980s with AT&amp;T's unpopular steps
toward 'commercialising' the operating system through a partnership with Sun
Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer.
Rival industry groups backed different versions of Unix, amid suspicions
AT&amp;T was favouring Sun over other computer makers.
These battles led to the formation of USL, in 1991, as an independent
business unit that would develop Unix technology while providing all
licensees with equal access to development plans. This was underscored by
the acquisition of minority stakes in USL by several computer and software
companies.
Novell's acquisition of USL will, however, once more place Unix under the
control of a single company, potentially resurrecting the old 'Unix wars'.
'Since AT&amp;T will no longer own USL, this eliminates some of the old
prejudices that have kept Unix in two camps and can help lead to the
unification of Unix,' said Mr Willem Roelandts, Hewlett-Packard
vice-president and general manager of the computer systems.
HP was a founding member of the Open Software Foundation, an industry group
that emerged in opposition to AT&amp;T's control over Unix. HP already has 'an
excellent relationship' with Novell, Mr Roelandts said. The same is true of
several other open systems computer manufactures.
Unix International, an industry organisation formed to back AT&amp;T's version
of Unix, was also quick to pronounce its approval of the Novell acquisition.
'As part of Novell, USL has pledged its commitment to fair and neutral
access to Unix technology,' said Mr Peter Cunningham, UI president and chief
executive.
The willingness of Unix supporters to adopt Novell as their new champion and
put aside the in-fighting that has characterised the open-systems movement
over the past few years represents a strong endorsement of Novell. It also,
however, suggests a closing of ranks in anticipation of the battle between
Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT.

FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Pinault-Printemps sells kitchen
chain to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT-Printemps, the French retailing group, has sold Mobis Expansion, a
chain of kitchen furniture shops, to the Guy Elmarak furniture company as
part of its ongoing programme of raising capital to reduce its debts.
Mobis, a chain of 41 shops across France, belonged to Conforama, the group
of furniture stores bought for FFr4.4bn (Dollars 800m) by Pinault in 1991.
The Conforama deal was one of the first stages of the transformation of
Pinault, originally an obscure timber group based in Brittany, from an
industrial concern into a broadly-based retailing group.
However Pinault has been burdened by heavy debts since late 1991 when it
made a FFr5.3bn partial bid for the Au Printemps stores and mail order
group. As a result it has for the past year been selling peripheral
businesses to try to bring down its borrowings.
Initially Pinault concentrated on selling its original manufacturing and
timber interests. More recently it has been looking for other ways of
reducing its debt and in the autumn secured an injection of FFr1bn from
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which is one of its main lenders. Mr
Francois Pinault, chairman, is now reported to be negotiating to buy part of
Credit Lyonnais' junk bond portfolio.
Mobis fits into Pinault's new strategy while Pinault said the disposal would
enable Conforama to concentrate on its core chain of furniture stores.

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Three groups' shares rise on drugs approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE PRODUCTS from British drug companies have received approval for sale
in the US. The move could bring in combined revenues of Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 980m) a year by 1998.
In a year-end spate of approvals, the US Food and Drug Administration gave
the go-ahead for Paxil, an antidepressant made by SmithKline Beecham,
Manoplax, a heart drug from Boots, and Tilade, an asthma treatment developed
by Fisons.
Paxil, branded as Seroxat in Europe, should be the biggest seller of the
three. Analysts believe it could become one of only a handful of
'blockbuster' drugs with sales of eventually of more than Dollars 1bn a year
throughout the world.
Sales in the US should begin in the next few weeks. SmithKline Beecham
shares rose 12p to 496p on New Year's Eve.
The approval of Fisons' Tilade ends a long period of uncertainty for the
company. The drug, upon which Fisons has pinned hopes for rapid growth in
the 1990s, has been awaiting US approval for almost six years.
In a departure from the company's usual practice, it will co-promote Tilade
with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US-based pharmaceuticals subsidiary of
Rhone-Poulenc, the french chemicals group. In return, Fisons will co-promote
Azmacort, RPR's asthma treatment, which works by a different mechanism.
Tilade will not be launched in the US until the second quarter of 1993, but
its shares advanced 15p to 245p on New Year's Eve.
Fisons also announced that it was abandoning attempts to revamp production
of one of the suspended drugs, Iron Dextran, a blood product, to meet FDA
requirements.
Boots was given a bigger boost than it expected by the terms of the approval
of Manoplax. The FDA's advisory committee had recommended approval only for
heart patients who could not tolerate the class of treatments called ACE
inhibitors. The ruling allows Manoplax to be given to any heart patient not
responding to other treatments.
Analysts forecast sales rising to Dollars 250m a year by 1998, and Boots
shares responded with a gain of 12p to 561p.
The FDA approved a fourth UK product, Indiclor, an imaging agent used in the
treatment of cancer and made by Amersham International. Although sales are
likely to be small in relation to the size of the company, Amersham shares
rose 17p to 619p.

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Injection for pharmaceuticals - The effects
of recent FDA rulings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FDA'S new year gifts to the UK pharmaceutical industry give the three
companies concerned a flying start to the rest of the decade. The drugs
approved are already selling well in markets outside the US, but approval in
the world's biggest single market is central to their fortunes.
SmithKline Beecham's antidepressant Paxil could be the company's biggest
selling product by the end of the century, replacing the venerable Tagamet,
the ulcer treatment that lost out to Glazo's Zantac in the 1980s.
Paxil has only two significant competitors, Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's
Zoloft, but is cheaper than either. The low price will appeal to
budget-conscious healthcare managers when it is launched in the next few
weeks.
Fisons and Boots are even more dependent on the success of their new
products. Approval for Tilade comes just nine months before the main patents
run out on Fisons' existing asthma treatment Intal, and the company has no
other significant products ready for submission to the FDA.
Approval is a watershed for Fisons. During most of the six years since the
drug's submission, the company's relations with the FDA have deteriorated.
FDA investigations led to licence suspensions on other products, and the
company had to made 91 amendments to the Tilade submission.
Fisons shares fell sharply last year, which also saw the departure of
several senior executives including Mr John Kerridge, the chairman and
driving force during the 1980s.
Even now, the company's troubles are not completely behind it. The terms of
the FDA approval mean that Tilade is unlikely to live up to the promise it
once had. Clinical trials show that Intal is better than Tilade in several
respects. Fisons has recognised that Tilade will not replace Intal in many
markets. Intal is used mostly by children and Fisons intends to market
Tilade primarily to adult asthma suffers, limiting its potential market.
For Boots, better known for its retail chain of pharmacies, Manoplax
promises a break into the pharmaceutical big time. Congestive heart failure
is estimated by the American Heart Association to affect as many as three
million people in the US with 400,000 new cases being reported every year,
says Boots.
Although analysts forecast sales of up to Dollars 250m (Pounds 165m) a year
eventually, this is largely a stab in the dark. Survey figures on whether
and how much Manoplax prolongs the lives of those who take it have yet to be
compiled. If they show that patients live longer, as well as having symptoms
relieved, the sales potential is far higher.

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 268m ITN contract just makes
deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIVE-YEAR news contract for Independent Television News, worth a total of
Pounds 268m, was finally signed on New Year's Eve after a year of
negotiation.
Two of the new ITV broadcasters, Meridian and Westcountry, held out for
better terms almost to the last moment. Lord Hollick's Meridian
Broadcasting, which has replaced TVS as the ITV company for the south and
south-east of England, was last to sign late on Thursday afternoon.
If Meridian had not signed a new supply agreement before midnight, it would
technically have been in breach of its licence because it could not have
provided a quality national and international news service.
ITN was determined to supply a news service only to those companies which
had signed the five-year agreement before the new year.
The brinkmanship arose because of the suspicion among ITV companies which
will not be ITN shareholders, that the Pounds 53.6m per annum deal might
lead to large profits for the seven companies which will own ITN in future.
Five companies will each have 18 per cent; they are Carlton Communications,
London Weekend Television, Central Television, Granada and Reuters, the
international information group.
Scottish Television and Anglia Television will each have 5 per cent.
A group of rebels including HTV, Yorkshire-Counties, Westcountry and
Meridian wanted an open-ended review of the contract after two years, in
case costs were dramatically cut at the news organisation and ITN was making
large profits for its new shareholders.
The Carlton-led negotiators opposed this on the grounds that it would have
amounted to a break in the contract and a renegotiation. Instead stiff
conditions have been set before a review is triggered involving a precise
definition of excessive profits on capital employed.
A review is now only likely if there is a fundamental change in ITN's costs
and the way it does its job. The final signing of the agreement means that
the reconstruction of ITN and the move to a tighter group of owners will now
go ahead.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, is expected to become the new
chairman of ITN in succession to Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames
Television which gave way to Carlton Television as the London weekday ITV
company at midnight on New Year's eve.
One of the first problems the new ITN shareholders will have to solve is a
potential annual deficit of Pounds 5m on its lease costs because of unlet
space in the company's London headquarters.

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Further losses at MMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MMI, which sponsors and markets financial products, announced further losses
in the six months to August 31, mainly because of continued lack of turnover
in its core BES business.
Losses for the period amounted to Pounds 282,466 on turnover of Pounds
483,495. This compared with Pounds 382,824 for the previous 14 months period
to February 28 1992, and with a deficit of Pounds 48,510 on turnover of
Pounds 475,539 for the same period of 1991.
Mr Arthur Morton, chairman, said the group had made a significant reduction
in costs which would be reflected in the second half of the year.
In November, the company agreed to purchase Moxon, Dolphin and Kerby, one of
the largest and longest established UK recruitment advertising companies.
Details of the purchase will be sent to shareholders shortly together with
the terms of a rights issue to provide funds for additional working capital
for MDK. The group raised Pounds 300,000 gross through a placing and open
offer last October following which, Mr Morton joined the board as chairman.
The is no interim dividend (0.25p). Losses per share were 3.26p (0.42p).

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Learnt from the lord and master - A look at
the success of the Hanson old boy network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF 1992 was a disappointing year for Lord Hanson, the chairman of Britain's
biggest conglomerate, it was something of a vintage year for the group's
former acquisition chiefs who have gone on to run their own companies.
One after another, the Hanson alumni took to the takeover trail in a manner
reminiscent of their former mentor.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins (who 'graduated' from Hanson
in 1983) outbid Hanson to buy Ranks Hovis McDougall. Mr John Newman, chief
executive of TT Group, (class of 77) acquired Magnetic Materials and made an
agreed bid for AB Electronics. Mr Chris Miller and Mr Philip Turner, chief
executive and strategy director respectively of Wassall, (class of 87)
launched their biggest bid to date for Evode, the chemicals and plastic
group.
Lord Hanson, whose year was conspicuous for not pulling off a big deal, is
delighted with the success of his former employees. 'We like to think we are
spreading our philosophy around' he said.
All members of the Hanson old boys club extol the virtues of working for
their old boss. 'It's the can-do, will-do attitude which is so laudable'
says Mr Hutchings. 'Hanson teaches you that you can get things done; there
is no red tape'. Mr Miller says Hanson fosters an entrepreneurial culture
which is infectious.
Yet is there anything particularly unusual in Hanson's grooming of future
chief executives? As Mr Hutchings puts it: 'When you think that thousands of
people have been through Hanson it is not that exceptional that some have
done well'.
If that is the case, argues one conglomerate analyst, why are there no chief
executives of new companies who worked at Imperial Chemical Industries?
Lord Hanson likes to think that the difference between his group and other
FT-SE 100 top companies is that he allows his executives at head office
greater autonomy.
In giving them that freedom he believes he helped clarify their own
ambitions. If you are expected to come up with new ideas and initiatives it
is not that surprising, argues Lord Hanson, that some decide to take a risk
and do their own thing.
If there is a leitmotiv that runs through the three conglomerates headed by
former Hanson executives it is in their choice of targets. These tend to be
lowish technology manufacturing businesses, which are not capital intensive.
However, all three, with varying degrees of emphasis, would take umbrage at
being called copy-cats. TT Group and Tomkins, believe they are more focused
than Hanson.
TT, which developed a reputation as an acquisitive industrial
mini-conglomerate, has effectively transformed itself into an electronics
product group through the purchase of Crystalate in 1990, the electronic
components maker, and last year's takeover of Magnetic Materials, a
USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, and now AB Electronics.
Tomkins, notwithstanding its decision to go into bread making, argues that
its mixtures of businesses, from guns to lawnmowers, is less diverse than
those acquired by Hanson.
Furthermore, both TT and Tomkins are generally not sellers of businesses. TT
has only ever sold two divisions of companies it acquired and then only
because it was offered 'large sums of money' for them. While Mr Hutchings
says he is not in the business of selling and buying companies since he is
not as good at it as Hanson.
Wassall believes its decision to earmark Dollars 20m of capital expenditure
at DAP, a US supplier of construction products and filling compounds, to
replace old machinery over the next two years underlines its commitment to
expanding and growing businesses - which is not what Hanson was best known
for in the past.
Wassall's senior managers are closest to Lord Hanson, not least because
Hanson backed them from the beginning by taking a stake in their company.
Mr Hutchings believes there are both pros and cons to having Hanson as a
shareholder. 'It is great to have it but then they have an influence. You
have to consider both the upside and the downside.'
Mr Miller strongly disagrees. 'They do not have any influence at all, we
benefit from the relationship. We are able to ring up Lord Hanson from time
to time and receive free advice.'
Lord Hanson says his conglomerate took a stake in Wassall because it was
asked to do so. 'If Greg Hutchings had asked us we would have done it.' Mr
Hutchings says it was not in his nature to do so. While Mr Newman, believing
the cost of shell companies to be prohibitively high, was not in a position
to ask Lord Hanson to invest in a public company. Instead, he ran private
companies for 10 years after leaving Hanson, before reversing one of them
into Tyzack Turner, later renamed TT.
Wassall's ex-Hanson men are, however, aware of one possible downside of
their close relationship with their former boss. They fear that they could
face a public relations problem if Hanson was to sell his stake. It has
already been diluted from 15 to 8 per cent. And, although Hanson has decided
to take up its rights in Wassall's cash call to pay for Evode, Mr Miller
believes that it may be in the best interests of both companies if Hanson
slowly dilutes its stake further.
All of Hanson's former executives are aware that the bigger they get the
greater the problem in finding the next target. Size maybe less of a concern
to TT, the smallest and most lowly rated of the conglomerates run by former
Hanson executives. But all three share Hanson's need to continue to make
further acquisitions, to maintain their momentum.
Mr Hutchings received a nasty shock when Tomkins' shares fell sharply on
news of his recommended bid for RHM, although they have recently recovered.
Since Hanson's paper is less rated than Tomkins, it could not top Tomkins'
Pounds 935m agreed bid for RHM without dipping deep into its cash reserves.
Lord Hanson says it was of no concern to him that he lost RHM since he was
happy to let Tomkins take 'the greater risk at a higher price'. He remains
confident that this year he will break out of the shadow of his former
colleagues by going back on to the acquisition trail.

FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: McMaster chain of department stores has
gone into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McMASTER Stores, a chain of Scottish department stores bought out from the
House of Fraser retail group in 1989, has gone into receivership.
The chain of seven stores, in towns such as Ayr, Irvine and Stirling,
employs a total of 300 people. The receivers, Mr Iain Bennet and Mr Alan
Jamieson of Price Waterhouse, hope to sell the stores soon, either
separately or as a whole, to save their jobs.
McMaster acquired the medium - sized stores in a management buy-out from the
al - Fayeds worth Pounds 6m, when House of Fraser decided to concentrate on
outlets with more than 100,000 sq ft of floor space.
Charterhouse invested Pounds 1m in the buy-out, which carried a heavy level
of debt. Although turnover was maintained through the recession, the chain
incurred losses in the last two years. It has debts in excess of Pounds 4m,
most of which is owed to Clydesdale Bank.

<TEXT>
The independent directors on the board of St Andrew Trust, the smaller
companies investment trust, have said that the offer from the Ecclesiastical
Insurance Office 'merits careful consideration' but are not recommending
acceptance.
The offer is a technical one being made to comply with new European
Community regulations; EIO, which currently has a 40.3 per cent stake in St
Andrew, needs to have a majority holding in the trust for capital adequacy
purposes. However, it does not wish to acquire more than a 75 per cent
stake, and thereby lose St Andrew's investment trust status.

<TEXT>
HANSON Industries, the US arm of the British conglomerate, has won a
preliminary injunction in the Missouri courts preventing Costain, the UK
construction company, from selling its Australian coal mining business to
Altus Finance, part of the French Credit Lyonnais banking group.
The court set a trial date for obtaining a permanent injunction for January
19. Costain, however, has filed an appeal over the ruling and requested
expedited consideration.
Costain had originally agreed to sell the coal mining assets to a Hanson
subsidiary, but subsequently announced that it had accepted a higher offer
of Dollars 245m (Pounds 160m) from Altus. In early November, Hanson filed a
suit in the US courts, seeking to have its Dollars 200m deal enforced and
alleging that Costain had given the Hanson subsidiary exclusive negotiating
rights.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Jury out on Kenyan experiment: Elections have left the
country precariously balanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Daniel arap Moi may come to look back on December 29 as the day he
won an election but lost the authority to govern Kenya.
Yesterday the ruling party's manipulation of the country's first multi-party
election for 26 years achieved what once seemed impossible. The country's
three main opposition leaders announced the formation of a united front and
vowed not to let Mr Moi assume power again.
Against the incongruous backdrop of new-year tinsel and bunting at a Nairobi
hotel, they pledged to set aside past differences of personality and tribe
to oust Mr Moi from the absolute power he has wielded for 14 years.
It is more easily said than done, and last night the opposition refused to
reveal its hand. But it is clear that Kenya will never be the same again and
now faces its most critical moment in history since independence from
Britain in 1964.
The future is uncertain - the country is precariously balanced between
further change and upheaval. At best Kenya will settle into a period of
fragile stability as the three party leaders attempt to wrest power from an
authoritarian president, or at least persuade him to share power in what
would be a government of national unity. At worst, the nation will be thrown
into civil strife.
Much will depend on whether Mr Moi, a reluctant democrat, can learn to live
in an era which requires a degree of tolerance, compromise and transparency
that he has lacked in 14 years of near unbridled power. Equally important
will be the opposition's capacity to contain the passions of its supporters.
Whatever the outcome, Tuesday's polls have set Kenya irreversibly on the
path of change.
Much is at stake, for Africa and the west. A successful transition from
autocracy to democracy would revive hopes for the recovery of a rare African
example of stability and growth. For the west it would mark the successful
culmination of the policy of linkage between aid and good government: the
imposition of a freeze on donor funds in November 1991 spurred Mr Moi to
drop the ban on opposition parties a month later.
Failure would not only prove devastating for Kenya's 26m people. It would
reverberate through a region scarred by tribalism, war and economic
mismanagement, and act as a body blow to hopes for resuscitation of the
continent as a whole, leaving western government reassessing the merits of
pushing authoritarian states down the road of pluralism.
For Mr Moi the election has been a painful, even humiliating, experience.
Hours after he cast his vote in a mountain retreat deep in the Rift Valley,
the 68-year-old president lashed out at his tormentors  - western
governments which twisted his arm, forcing him to introduce multi-party
politics by 'starving Kenya'.
Few African leaders have proved as resistant to the continent's new wind of
change as Mr Moi. For nearly a quarter century the country had been an
African role model and a leading recipient of western aid. Real growth in
gross domestic product narrowly outpaced an annual population increase of
3.5-4 per cent. But from the mid-1980s Kenya's reputation became ever more
tarnished by human rights abuses, economic mismanagement and corruption that
ate away at reform attempts.
A year ago, the country became a test case: could international donors, by
linking aid to good government, nudge an unwilling autocrat down the road
towards democracy and economic transparency? And could democracy take root
in a tribally based African nation after more than a quarter century of
rotten one-party statism? For the moment, the jury is still out on the Kenya
experiment.
Provisional results from 167 of the 188 constituencies showed last night
that, technically, Mr Moi and the ruling party Kanu are back in power, but
the veteran leader has been badly mauled.
He has won the presidency against stiff competition from Mr Kenneth Matiba,
but with only 36 per cent of the presidential poll against Mr Matiba's 27
per cent. In the parliamentary election Kanu was last night headed for a
narrow majority, but only if the 12 MPs which can be nominated by the
president are included in the total. Several of Mr Moi's most important
heavyweight supporters, such as Mr Ndolo Ayah, the foreign minister, and Mr
Elijah Mwangale, the agriculture minister, were defeated in an election that
claimed 14 cabinet ministers.
However, the opposition yesterday said that it did not accept the results of
an election which, it claims, was 'blatantly rigged' and marked by
widespread intimidation, massive fraud and introduction of illegal ballot
boxes.
Any electoral abuses, however, did not protect Mr Moi from the humiliating
exposure of the depth of his unpopularity among the Kikuyus and Luos,
Kenya's two largest tribes. Kanu failed to secure a single seat of 25
constituencies in the Kikuyu homeland of Central Province and won only one
seat in the Luo-dominated Nyanza Province. In the presidential poll Mr Moi
won a mere 2.5 per cent of the vote in Central Province.
Should he try to govern in defiance of the opposition parties, he will be
unable to include members of Kenya's most powerful and politically active
tribes in his cabinet. Many political observers believe this will make it
almost impossible for him to rule.
At a hasty meeting the three main opposition parties - Ford-Asili led by Mr
Matiba, Ford-Kenya led by Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and the Democratic party
led by Mr Mwai Kibaki - said they were forming a united opposition front to
'avert the imminent crisis in the country'. They demanded fresh elections
and said they were determined to prevent Mr Moi from assuming office. Behind
these demands lies the considerable threat of violence which the opposition
could initiate to bring the country to its knees.
As politicians, in government and in opposition, grope to come to terms with
the new post-electoral reality, the role of western governments remains
critical. Having initiated the process of change by freezing aid worth
USDollars 350m-Dollars 400m a year, they now have to keep pace with
developments.
Like the Commonwealth and other observer groups, they have been reluctant to
condemn the poll as 'unfree and unfair', and inclined to argue in favour of
a 'second best' solution - in which Kenya is seen as having taken a 'first
step on the road to democracy' and Mr Moi remains in power, but faces the
checks and balances provided by a powerful parliamentary opposition.
The US, Britain and other donors have to walk a delicate path between
legitimising Mr Moi and recognising the power of the opposition. The
performance of the opposition to date has not been distinguished, however,
and its capacity to act as an effective coalition has yet to be proved.
The patient queues of voters were eloquent testimony to the belief of
Kenyans in the ballot box, but the result showed that democracy in Kenya
remains dominated by tribalism. Thirty years after independence, ethnic
loyalties and rivalries, not ideology, determine voter allegiances.
In the weeks ahead, Mr Moi will surely continue to exploit these differences
and seek to buy off opposition by persuasion, intimidation or patronage. In
the meantime the opposition lacks the machinery to organise
extra-parliamentary action such as a general strike. The trade union
movement is weak and poorly led and it is unlikely that it could co-ordinate
a strike or other protest. However, the ability of the opposition to call
out tens of thousands of demonstrators on to the streets of Kenya is
formidable, even if it cannot control the outcome.
Meanwhile, the political machinations under way are certain to distract
attention from the most severe economic crisis Kenya has faced since
independence, exacerbated by massive extra-budgetary funding of Kanu's
election campaign.
Symptoms of the crisis include a rate of inflation now exceeding 40 per cent
a year, money supply growth well above a target of 10 per cent, a soaring
budget deficit and a continuing foreign exchange squeeze.
The population of 26m is set to double by 2010 and hunger for land is
increasing in a country two-thirds arid or semi-arid and with no known
mineral resources. The country's largest foreign exchange earner, tourism,
has already been badly hit by fears of instability and violence.
Unless a political accommodation is reached, the economic decline will
become irreversible and, as the economy falters and unemployment rises, the
prospects for strife grow ominously greater.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: No substitute for insuring safety of pensions
benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM SHUCKSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A central fund (Letters, December 24) is no answer at all to pensions
protection. There can be no substitute for trustees ensuring there are
adequate funds to secure at competitive insurance company rates the defined
deferred benefits which fall to be preserved on winding-up on a guaranteed
basis. It may be that some funds are so large that no UK insurance company
is capable of accepting the risk and, in these circumstances, the
substitution of money purchase benefits may be inevitable. Indeed, it should
be available as an option to members of all wound-up schemes.
However, such options are no reason to permit the discharge of obligations
by transfer payments to a discontinuance fund or other arrangements of
lesser value than the insurance market cost of securing the defined benefits
for each member. To substitute transfer values based on high assumed
investment returns from equities is to substitute hope value for guaranteed
benefits. Potential benefits, as a euphemism for expected benefits stripped
of their guarantee, are not an acceptable substitute. The fact that, after
completion of winding-up, a scheme no longer enjoys the financial support of
the employer is an important factor which cannot simply be ignored.
Mr Cockbain's proposed discontinuance fund would be a solution if he and his
partners personally guaranteed the deferred benefits to which members are
entitled under preservation legislation. If they did, I suspect the
'appropriate transfer payments' would be very much larger than they have in
mind at present and that they would alter the proposed investment strategy
radically away from equities and towards fixed-interest or index-linked
securities which provide a much closer match to the liabilities to be met.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC low-cost TV stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON D LEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Raymond Snoddy's article, 'Broadcasting newcomer promises
cost-effective TV' (December 21), on the new approach to television which
TSW is adopting in the West Country, we at the BBC have not been slow off
the mark to adopt low-cost solutions when building new TV stations.
For the BBC World Service TV network, our engineers took the project from
concept to reality in less than three months, creating a fully automated
three-camera studio, editing and transmission suites, and a newsroom for a
fraction of the cost of TSW's bid.
Following our fact-finding mission to Europe, a big saving for this 24-hour
network was the use of fluorescent studio lights which removed the need for
additional air conditioning. This was all completed in 1991 and the network
has been operating to an increasing worldwide audience ever since. Gordon D

FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Onerous burden in order to satisfy Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R LEGROVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Q &amp; A Briefcase item, 'How to work out that CGT bill' (December
19), highlights the onerous burden that this tax imposes. I had rather
similar calculations to perform earlier this year when I sold some
accumulation units; each tax voucher since March 1982 had to be indexed. I
reached retirement age more than eight years ago but fortunately I am still
sufficiently numerate to cope.
Monthly savings schemes and accumulation funds are, by their nature, most
likely to be cashed in by elderly persons who had prudently been using them
to make extra provision for their old age. Many might find the calculations
daunting if not altogether beyond them.
Pensioners ought not to find themselves obliged to incur accountants' fees
in order to satisfy the Inland Revenue: a very poor reward for thrift.
The sums involved are unlikely to be large and a budget concession absolving
the elderly from CGT liability on savings schemes of these sorts would be
most welcome. Something for the chancellor to think about when he has a
moment to spare.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Inflation factor that makes early leavers the big
pensions losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Alan Smallbone's letter (December 30), I believe adequacy of
pensions is more significant than security. Deferred members of defined
benefits schemes subsidise schemes, via inflation, to provide promised
benefits for the few who reach retirement with the same company.
You have reported a well-known insurance company as calculating the
shortfall for early leavers to be equivalent to a 70 per cent increase in
combined contributions to company schemes. I calculate that, nationally, the
loss caused by inflation is about Pounds 20bn a year for early leavers.
Many deferred pensioners joined schemes as a condition of service. One can
draw one's own conclusions on the ethics of such schemes and government
reluctance to act decisively to end completely the anomaly created by
inflation.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Palestinians exiled not deported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J P DE ROOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to point out your erroneous word usage in relation to the
exile of 400 Palestinians. In most articles you use 'deport', 'deportee',
and 'deportation' ('Court rejects appeal to reverse Israeli expulsion of
Palestinians', December 23). According to my dictionary, deportation is the
'banishment of an undesirable alien to his native country'. 'Deportation'
would imply the Palestinians are 'aliens', 'undesirable' and that this
practice by the Israeli government is lawful and within the right of any
country.
The correct terminology should be either 'exile' or 'banishment'. The term
'expulsion' is preferable to 'deportation'.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Leading Article: A cause for celebration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'TRY NOVELTIES for salesman's bait,' wrote Goethe. 'For novelties win
everyone.' Europe's single market, which officially started yesterday, is a
welcome novelty, and not just for political and commercial salesmen seeking
a winning slogan in a bleak winter. It comes into force at an unpropitious
moment, with west and east Europeans beset by recession and upheaval. Yet
hope sometimes finds its firmest footing in a time of gloom. Opening up
closed industrial, service and financial sectors to more competition may
cause short-term pain, but it is the best recipe for growth. Provided
companies, individuals and governments grasp the opportunities, the single
market offers Europe its best chance of prosperity.
Acrimony and fragmentation have characterised European politics in the past
12 months. But the Community deserves congratulation for enacting on time
virtually all of a complex legislative programme, first outlined in 1985,
allowing free movement of persons, goods, capital and services. Despite the
impediments and imperfections remaining, the EC has pulled off an impressive
feat.
Placing the measures on the statute book was onerous. Making them work will
be still harder. The EC faces four challenges. First, member countries will
have to apply the rules firmly and equitably. The EC's new insistence on
subsidiarity must not impede effective enforcement. Second, governments
should seek ways of countering the currency instability, seen by many chief
executives as undermining the single market's prospects of success.
Increased access
Third, the new market must be outward rather than inward-looking. This is
crucial for relations with North America and Japan, and also for allowing
increased access for exports from central and eastern Europe - all the more
important in view of the EC's plans for enlargement. Fourth, the single
market must be made attractive and inspiring to Europe's citizens - at a
time when 16m people in the EC are without jobs, and economic growth is the
lowest since 1981-82.
If the EC now faces difficulties, the story of the single market shows how
such tests can be surmounted. Following 12 years of debilitation after the
1973 oil shock, the single market was conceived as a means of bringing the
Community back to life. The relaunch was accomplished through amendments to
the Treaty of Rome which came into force with the Single European Act in
1987. The act was relatively uncontroversial, yet it encompassed
far-reaching steps towards a supranational Europe. Along with the aim of
establishing 'an area without internal frontiers', the act brought in
qualified majority voting as well as the objective of economic and monetary
union.
Investment surge
In some senses, the single market existed before it was born. An investment
surge by companies anticipating abolition of borders, combined with the
effect of German reunification, made 1986-90 a buoyant period. During that
time the Community registered annual average growth of 3.2 per cent, three
times the OECD's forecast for this year's performance. Without this helpful
background, the single market may well have run into the type of opposition
that has befallen the Maastricht treaty.
As it is, the single market starts life punctually, but in a world made
uncertain by change. One of the EC's prime problems is its flagging
competitiveness, starkly underlined by a trade deficit with the rest of the
world of Dollars 60bn to Dollars 70bn a year (against a Dollars 20bn surplus
in 1985). Conscious of this handicap, not least vis-a-vis newly
industrialised countries, large European companies seem likely initially to
use the single market above all to spur further productivity gains, through
rationalising and concentrating their activities.
Over the longer term, the single market opens a path to a more cohesive and
competitive Europe which will create and not destroy jobs. By encouraging
countries and companies to adopt the best available business and labour
practices, it lays groundwork for deeper integration, including, perhaps,
monetary union. So the new year beacons of celebration shone in a good
cause. The milestone of the single market shows how far the Community has
travelled; and it provides a sense of direction and purpose for the arduous
but rewarding journey still to come.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Tomorrow's world: Last year confirmed many of the gloomy
forecasts made 12 months ago. Answering the most pressing questions for
1993, FT writers do not expect a great change in global fortunes - but there
are one or two sparks of optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF, EDWARD MORTIMER, PHILIP STEPHENS, LIONEL BARBER, HUGH
CARNEGY, JUREK MARTIN, JOHN LLOYD, ALEXANDER NICOLL and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year was an annus horribilis for the Queen. It was an annus horribilis
for Mr George Bush and Mr Neil Kinnock. But what sort of year was it for the
reputation of the FT writers who were asked a year ago for their forecasts
for 1992?
Joe Rogaly wondered whether the Labour party would win the general election.
'Possibly, but not probably' was his answer, one that proved closer to the
truth than the polls and most pundits. Asked whether George Bush would be
beaten, Lionel Barber replied 'no, but he will have a run for his money'. He
did, indeed, but then he was beaten.
Asked whether the economy faced a great depression, Samuel Brittan replied
robustly that 'this constant harping on the great depression is an enemy to
serious thinking'. Certainly, it did not happen in 1992. Barry Riley
predicted that 'all in all, you are likely to make some money on shares over
1992'. So you were. Meanwhile, John Plender correctly predicted that UK
house prices would fall in another year of gloom for homeowners.
Martin Wolf predicted that the European Community's exchange rate mechanism
would be realigned, which was hardly conventional wisdom a year ago. He also
thought the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations would be
completed in 1992. He was right in judging the differences over agriculture
too small to be an obstacle forever, but that agreement took longer than
expected to reach.
John Lloyd argued correctly that there would not be a civil war in what used
to be the Soviet Union, but noted that several small wars were raging
already. Judy Dempsey said Serbs and Croats would not make up, and also
pointed to the dangers in other republics of the former Yugoslavia. Her
warning was wise, as was the forecast from Roger Matthews that there would
be no peace treaty between Arabs and Israelis in 1992. Meanwhile, Alexander
Nicoll concluded that the Chinese Communist party would not go the way of
the Communist party of the Soviet Union.
Finally, David Lascelles thought the First Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
would be mostly hot air, but also hoped it would focus the world's minds.
The summit was at least more successful than its host, Mr Fernando Collor de
Mello, who resigned this week faced with impeachment.
In all, 1992 was a good year for FT forecasters. What a pity about the
world.
Will there be a global recovery?
Martin Wolf writes: No, not in the countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole, if recovery means
substantially faster economic growth than the 1 1/2 per cent expected for
1992.
The OECD forecasts growth of aggregate OECD gross domestic product of 1.9
per cent between 1992 and 1993. Even this improvement is unlikely, unless
the US economy achieves growth substantially greater than the 2.4 per cent
now forecast.
The OECD believes Japan and Germany will grow by 2.3 per cent and 1.2 per
cent, respectively, between 1992 and 1993. This is already far below the 3.1
per cent and 2.3 per cent forecast by the OECD last June. In the present
recession, however, mainstream forecasters have tended to underestimate
economic weakness. There is a good chance that the Japanese economy will
grow very little between 1992 and 1993, while German GDP will shrink.
Will there be peace in the Balkans?
Edward Mortimer writes: Alas, most unlikely. The war in Bosnia might peter
out, but only on the basis of a de facto Serb victory which neither the
international community nor the Moslem losers would ever accept de jure. In
this case the Moslems would prepare for another round, smuggling in weapons
from Moslem states. On top of that, Croatia may have a go at recapturing
territory lost to the Serbs in 1991, when the UN mandate in those areas
expires in March.
In Serbia proper, clashes are likely between Serbs and Hungarians in
Voivodina, which could draw in Hungary; between Serbs and Moslems in the
Sanjak; and above all between Serbs and the Albanians who form 90 per cent
of the population in Kosovo. Both Albania and the Albanian minority in
Macedonia would then be sorely tempted to help their kith and kin, which in
turn could bring Serbian reprisal raids across their borders. It would not
take much to upset the delicate balance in Macedonia between Slav majority
and Albanian minority; and chaos in Macedonia could lead to intervention by
any combination of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. If the last two are
both involved, the Balkans could become the scene of the first war between
two Nato allies.
Will John Major still be UK prime minister at the end of 1993?
Philip Stephens writes: Yes. If there is a single lesson from 1992, it is
that political predictions are as useful as the average long-range weather
forecast. Most people thought that John Major would lose the April election.
No one anticipated the calamities that befell him a few months later.
But the storms have abated and the satellite pictures tell us that there is
a much clearer, if dull, spell ahead. There will be more unexpected squalls
but, having survived the disintegration of his economic strategy, Mr Major
is unlikely to be swept away.
An end to the recession should help the prime minister restore some of his
battered authority. Even Labour's John Smith - who will also still be around
at the end of the year - believes that Mr Major will fight the general
election due in 1996-97. But both leaders need to make an effort to persuade
us that politics and politicians have the capacity to excite and enthuse as
well as to survive.
Will the Maastricht treaty be ratified and what difference does it make?
Lionel Barber writes: The Danes remain capable of pulling off surprises, but
the odds are that the Maastricht treaty will be ratified after a divisive
referendum in late April or May. Britain will follow, thanks to Mr Major's
deft handling of the EC summit in Edinburgh and the probability that Tory
Euro-sceptic opposition peaked in early October, shortly after the petit Oui
in the French referendum.
The treaty itself is flawed. Monetary union for the 12 by the end of the
decade looks fanciful. Germany is wavering about giving up the D-Mark. The
big question this year is how the EC will respond to crises beyond its
borders, in eastern Europe, Russia and the former Yugoslavia. The answer
will determine whether the EC strengthens Maastricht's provisions for a
common security and foreign policy - or once again defers to the US.
Will there be an ERM at the end of the year?
Martin Wolf writes: Yes, but a further reduced one. The current European
exchange rate mechanism is likely to collapse into a narrow D-Mark zone,
while exchange rates among all five major European economies - Germany,
France, Italy, the UK and Spain - either float or become readily adjustable.
If this outcome is to be avoided, German monetary policy must be loosened
both substantially and soon.
The Bundesbank believes that the ERM is making a welcome return to the
adjustable exchange rates of the period before 1987. But the absence of
effective exchange controls makes any such ERM unstable.
The persistently slow economic growth of today exacerbates the ERM's
unavoidable fragility. Markets may accept that the Benelux countries are
prepared to import restrictive German monetary policies, whatever their
consequences. They do not believe that large countries will tolerate slow
economic growth indefinitely. When the problem is restrictive German
monetary policy, the only escape is in the possibility of substantial
exchange rate movement, in both directions. Since such movement has been
precluded by the D-Mark's anchor role in the ERM, the system will have to be
modified substantially.
Will there be peace in the Middle East?
Hugh Carnegy writes: The crisis over Israel's deportation of 415
Palestinians and the spate of killings that preceded it by Islamic
fundamentalists in the occupied territories showed how easily violence can
dominate events in the Middle East, disrupting peace negotiations begun in
late 1991.
In any case, Israel has yet fully to bite the bullet on yielding the Arab
lands it has occupied for more than 25 years, despite the election of Mr
Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led government. The terms so far on offer from Israel
fall well short of the minimum that the Palestine Liberation Organisation
could accept without risking a grass-roots rebellion within its own ranks
and within the Islamicists.
Nevertheless, the fundamentals which drove Israel and its Arab neighbours
into talks still apply: the US is dominant in the region following the
demise of the Soviet Union; all countries engaged in the negotiations have
deep strategic and economic reasons for maintaining good relations with the
US and the west; the ultimate alternative to peace - non-conventional war,
possibly involving a resurgent Iran - scares everybody.
The Washington talks will almost certainly resume after the Clinton
administration takes over. But, as the deportation crisis illustrates, the
'window of opportunity' for peace may be narrowing. Awareness of this should
spur all sides on to a breakthrough this year. But never discount the
volatility of the conflict, which could as easily destroy the chance of
agreements.
Where are the next global hotspots?
Edward Mortimer writes: The problem with the new world disorder is that
almost anywhere can be a hotspot. Explosions can happen without detonating a
superpower conflict, because there is only one superpower left. The
disintegration of the other superpower has, however, left plenty of fissile
material around - figuratively and, alas, literally. Watch for signs of a
more truculent Russia, ready to intervene on behalf of Russian minorities in
other ex-Soviet republics: most dangerous would be Ukraine.
Likewise watch Hungary, surrounded on three sides by countries with large
Hungarian minorities, living on territory that was Hungarian before 1918.
Further afield, Africa and the Middle East are full of unresolved conflicts.
If US intervention appears to succeed in Somalia, there may be demand for it
elsewhere, such as Sudan. In Asia, Cambodia seems almost certain to blow up
again, as the Khmer Rouge is sabotaging the UN peace plan.
Veteran communist rulers Deng Xiaoping of China, Kim Il Sung of North Korea
and Fidel Castro of Cuba are presumed to be mortal. Should any of them pop
off this year, the temperature would rise in and around their countries.
Will US President Bill Clinton get it wrong in the year ahead?
Jurek Martin writes: Probably not, unless he is simply overwhelmed by
events. Lack of big-league experience notwithstanding, few presidents have
come to the job so well prepared in policy terms, so keen to deploy a
formidable intellect on practical problems, and with such highly developed
political and populist instincts. Critically, he may also be 'lucky', if the
recent modest improvement in the economy he is inheriting can be sustained
and if the opposition Republicans remain in their present state of disarray.
The pitfalls are obvious: a double handful of external crises, which may
require more US military involvement overseas and, relatively, less of his
promised 'laser beam' focus on the domestic and economic programme;
structural issues at home, like healthcare, welfare and education reform,
which will bring him up against powerful vested interests; and financial
market scepticism about his determination to control the budget deficit.
But with the Democrats running Congress and as keen as Mr Clinton to end
'gridlock', and with every new president enjoying a honeymoon of varying
length, there is no reason why he should not have a productive first year.
The betting is that the new policies to be set in train will more resemble
in their longer-term impact the very different agenda of President Ronald
Reagan's first year in 1981. For most new presidents life gets harder after
year one, as the first mid-term elections to Congress loom.
Will reform continue in the former Soviet Union?
John Lloyd writes: Most things will get worse in Russia this year. The
policies of President Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar began the march to the
market. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the latter's successor as prime minister,
must choose between continuing the (relatively) tight money policies brought
in by the Gaidar team - and thus risk mass unemployment - and debauching the
currency, courting financial collapse. The decisions which must be made this
year - on the economy, the constitution, the integrity of the Russian state,
the form of the Commonwealth of Independent States - should not be further
postponed.
Ukraine has just begun economic reforms from a position of near
hyperinflation, and with most of its industries suffering a severe loss of
markets. In the three Baltic states - especially tiny Estonia - financial
reforms have begun and have yet to hit employment.
The three Caucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are now all on
militarised footing, their rackety economies (with the exception of the
Azeri energy sector) ignored. The four central Asian states of Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are suffering from a big market loss
in Russia. Tajikistan is also rent with civil war.
Only Belarus in the west and Kazakhstan in the south remain relatively
stable, so far avoiding both nationalist excess and plunges in living
standards.
But there are no hiding places from the effects of the excruciating
painfulness of integration into the world economy. This pain will deepen in
1993.
Is Chinese economic reform set to last?
Alexander Nicoll writes: China's economic growth rate, at about 12 per cent,
is probably the world's fastest in 1992, the result of a push for reform by
88-year-old Deng Xiaoping. Production, investment and exports have shot up.
After 14 years, reform has considerable momentum, especially in the
prosperous south. It is probably irreversible, even if it suffers setbacks
as after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
Most of the economy is effectively in the private sector, and prices of many
goods have been freed in 1992. But the bloated public sector presents huge
challenges.
Two doubts remain: when Deng dies, will economic reformers survive in power
without him? More immediately, will fast growth lead to overheating and
austerity - slowing reform - as did two previous booms? A third question
looms ever larger: will economic freedom lead to greater pressure for
political freedom? The Communist party is determined to resist such demands
at any cost.
Will Brazil realise its potential as Latin America's economic powerhouse?
Stephen Fidler writes: No. Brazil seems determined not to lose its
reputation as 'the country of the future'. Brazilians face more stagflation
in 1993 or, worse, another ineffective economic shock plan.
The government is now fighting inflation by keeping real interest rates high
 -which is why the economy is so weak - but has not fundamentally addressed
the core of the problem: a budget deficit of 40 per cent of GDP.
President Itamar Franco, who took office after the impeachment on corruption
charges of Collor, seems inclined to lower interest rates to reactivate the
economy. If he does, inflation will accelerate. But if he does not and
interest rates stay high, the economy will remain weak.
Either way, many Brazilians are betting that 1993 will see another shock
plan - unorthodox measures such as freezing bank deposits and fixing prices
and wages, which will fail without necessary fiscal reform - in a vain
attempt to magic away the country's problems.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE western powers struggle to redefine their international roles in the
post-cold war political climate, the markets confront an equally difficult,
if less newsworthy, set of adjustments. The case for optimism, at the start
of a year that will see no more than sickly economic growth in the developed
world, is that some of the building blocks of a sounder economic and
financial order are in place - not least a pattern of capital flows that
begins to make global sense.
In the 1980s the world's creditor countries recycled disproportionate sums
to the United States, thereby diverting capital from potentially higher
returns in the developing world. Today, in contrast, Latin America is once
again emerging as a capital importer, after a decade in which its economies
were throttled by debt and bad policy. Direct inward investment into China
is contributing to such dramatic double-digit growth rates that there is a
real, and awesome, possibility that China might become the world's largest
economy within a matter of decades. Meanwhile the dragon economies of Asia
are hosting some of the world's biggest infrastructure projects, as well as
playing their traditional game of export-led growth.
Policy mistakes
The snag is that the markets of the developed world are still scarred by the
policy mistakes and exchange rate disequilibria of an earlier period.
Conventional wisdom has it that the United States will lead the world out of
recession, but more slowly than in previous economic cycles. With the
private sector constrained by debt, the banking system fragile and fiscal
policy less expansionary than it looks because of the debt interest burden
and the cost of bank bale-outs, it is hard to quarrel with that verdict. The
US is in no position, this time, to act as a locomotive for the world.
Nor is it easy to be optimistic about Europe, where German unification has
resulted in a policy mix comparable with Reaganomics and an outcome that is
arguably more damaging. The German combination of loose fiscal and tight
monetary policy imparted a powerful deflationary impetus to the rest of
Europe via the rigid framework of the ERM. Having voluntarily sacrificed
their monetary sovereignty, the larger member countries of the ERM then felt
obliged to follow Germany in relaxing fiscal policy.
As a result, Europe is now a capital importer, which slightly mars the more
attractive picture of capital flows painted earlier; and the fiscal legacy
of the ERM period raises questions about the ability of equities to resist
the gravitational pull of any rise in long bond yields, especially in those
countries that have improved their prospects for recovery by leaving the
ERM.
Tide over
For Britain, where the public sector borrowing requirement threatens to top
Pounds 50bn, compared with an annual institutional cash flow of just under
Pounds 40bn, the question is acute. Yet despite fears of funding crises
ahead, long gilt yields have not risen since sterling left the ERM. This
suggests, first, that the markets do not expect the one-off rise in import
prices after devaluation to leave an early mark on wage settlements.
Perhaps, too, that inflation is assumed to be moderating at such a pace that
the gilt market offers sufficiently high real returns to persuade
international capital to tide the government over until growth permits a
significant reduction in the PSBR.
Even so, UK equities are moving into more contentious territory. And there
are still plenty of areas of instability around the globe. The currency
markets have unfinished business in the ERM, where the French franc
continues to be vulnerable. Japan, the only significant creditor country
remaining, is in the throes of a banking crisis; its equity market persists
in staying overvalued chiefly thanks to the manipulation of public sector
pension funds. And there is a worryingly small flow of capital into the
former communist bloc, which underlines the geopolitical, as well as the
economic and financial risks, with which the markets must live. There are
limits to what capital can achieve in the absence of political leadership.
With Mr Clinton in the White House, leadership has another chance. Let us
hope, in 1993, that the chance is grasped.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Pension fund returns improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION funds enjoyed high annual investment returns last year, according to
initial estimates, in spite of the poor state of the economy.
Investment returns - capital gains plus income - of 19 per cent to 20 per
cent on average were the best annual result since 1989.
Most of the gains were earned in the final few months of the year, following
the withdrawal of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism in
September.
According to WM Company, performance-measurement specialists, the
best-performing asset category was overseas bonds, with returns of more than
31 per cent boosted by the devaluation. Equities returned about 20 per cent,
both at home and overseas, and UK bonds 15 per cent.
The only disappointing category was property, which returned just 1 per cent
or 2 per cent. Funds owning no property will therefore have performed
better, and are likely to show an overall average return of 20 per cent.
But according to Hymans Robertson, the pension consultants and actuaries,
last year's returns could prove illusory, because although share prices were
strong dividends fell slightly. On an actuarial basis returns are likely to
be closer to 5 per cent, and are 'less than adequate' when compared to
inflation-linked liabilities.
Hymans Robertson said: 'A typical pension fund with a healthy surplus at the
end of 1991 is likely to see part of that surplus eroded in 1992, reducing
markedly its flexibility.'
WM said that although stock market returns were good last year the 1990s
still look like being the decade of the bond.
Over the three years 1990, 1991 and 1992 UK and overseas bonds have produced
annualised returns of 14 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, but UK
equities have returned only 9 per cent and overseas equities a disappointing
2 per cent.
WM added that 1992 was likely to prove another bad year for pension-fund
cashflows, reflecting the number of companies taking contribution holidays.
Cashflow was only 3 per cent of assets in 1991 and will have been even lower
last year.
These estimates and comments are based on market returns. Actual
pension-fund returns will be calculated individually over the next few
weeks.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Unified Budget timetable outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, has moved to reassure
MPs that the new unified Budget arrangements will not mean a reduction in
parliamentary time for the finance bill, Alison Smith writes.
In a letter to Mr Nick Brown, a Labour Treasury spokesman, Mr Dorrell says
that this year's second Budget will be in early December. The finance bill
will be published early the following January and will complete its passage
through parliament by May 5.
Labour is likely to be satisfied with the timetable which means that, as
now, there will be just less than four months between the publication of the
finance bill and its enactment.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Rotodyne failed despite political support: Macmillan lost
fight for revolutionary aviation project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN abandoned a project to build a hybrid helicopter/fixed-wing aircraft
to revolutionise intercity travel in spite of strong backing from Mr Harold
Macmillan, the prime minister.
The Fairey Rotodyne project was ultimately cancelled by the government 30
years ago but cabinet papers released yesterday show Mr Macmillan had
insisted four years earlier that the project 'must not be allowed to die'.
The aim was to produce an aircraft which would take off vertically and carry
48 passengers at 180mph over a 200-mile range.
The Rotodyne, which had two small wings and was powered by two
turbo-propeller engines and a rotor blade, was aimed at intercity air
travel.
A prototype first flew in 1957 after the government funded Pounds 13m of
development costs. Commercial airlines showed little interest and the
project was dropped on February 12 1962 after armed forces chiefs said they
were not prepared to support it.
A similar aircraft, the Boeing-Bell tilt rotor, is being developed in the US
supported by the US government. The aircraft takes off vertically like a
helicopter and then flies like a fixed-wing aircraft.
The US aircraft, of a roughly similar capacity to the UK project but with
much longer range, has been earmarked for military and civil applications.
The Cabinet papers also disclosed that the Anglo-French Concorde could have
been called 'Europa' or 'Alliance' if the British government had had its
way.
Although the British and French governments formally agreed to build the
supersonic airliner on November 29 1962 the two countries continued to
disagree on the name of the jet, according to the cabinet papers. The
aviation minister at the time, Mr Peter Thorneycroft (now Lord
Thorneycroft), suggested 'Alliance' and 'Europa' to the cabinet.
He said France had agreed to a name that underlined co-operation and meant
the same in the two languages.
The two manufacturers of the aircraft, British Aircraft Corporation (now
absorbed into British Aerospace) and Sud Aviation (now part of Aerospatiale
of France), preferred Concorde.
The consortium had planned up to 40 aircraft, but in fact only 16 were
produced.
Aerospace manufacturers are now studying the development of a
second-generation supersonic airliner with a capacity of 300 against
Concorde's 100.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Sponsorship spending comes under the microscope: Companies
want their arts expenditure to work harder for them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES are taking a long, hard look at one area of expenditure that
could be seen as less than essential in a recession: corporate sponsorship.
Royal Insurance set the tone this week when it decided to end its Pounds
700,000-a-year sponsorship of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Mr Roy Randall of Royal Insurance said: 'We certainly got a lot out of our
association with the RSC but in a recession, if dividends are not
increasing, you can expect that some shareholders may not be as keen on it
as we are.'
Others are also reviewing the benefits of having their name on a programme
when set against the cost.
Mr Robert Pennant-Jones, head of communications at British Petroleum, the UK
oil group, said: 'We're beginning to come to the conclusion that big
national sponsor-ships are not as good for some of our operating companies
as smaller local efforts.'
BP spends about Pounds 600,000 a year on the arts and has a fairly extensive
spread of sponsorship inherited from Mr Robert Horton, its former chairman,
who was ousted last year.
The company remains committed to its present programme but it is not
planning to take on any more sponsorships. BP will also be looking very hard
at its existing commitments when they come up for renewal. These include the
National Portrait Gallery in London and Cardiff's Singer of the Year
competition,
Few companies appear to be looking for new events to sponsor while profits
remain under pressure. Ms Ross Frost, sponsorship manager at Barclays Bank,
said: 'It simply means we can't expand.' The bank spends about Pounds 1m a
year on the arts, including sponsorship of fringe theatre.
Corporate sponsorship can be crucial in creating an image for a company. BP,
for example, sponsored a high-profile ecology exhibition at the Natural
History Museum in London as a way of making a statement about its concern
for the environment.
Sponsored events also provide a venue for corporate entertainment, where
customers can go backstage and meet the cast of a play.
Privatised companies such as British Gas, which spends Pounds 10m a year on
sponsorship, and British Telecom stress how sponsorship meets the need to
put something back into the community.
Mr Bob Raggett at British Telecom, which spends Pounds 16m a year on
sponsorship, said: 'It is important for us to sponsor events which get the
arts out to the people.'
For example, the company sponsored a tour of the Scottish islands by the
Scottish Symphony Orchestra - the first time such a tour had been organised.
Even British Gas and British Telecom, with their deep pockets, are
scrutinising their commitments. British Gas is reassessing its approach to
sponsorship and charitable giving in the light of regulatory constraints,
while British Telecom is responding to the cold economic climate by trying
to get greater benefit from its sponsorship.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Companies pin hopes on year-end exchange rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TREASURY managers at UK companies were yesterday monitoring how sterling
ended 1992 against the dollar, the D-Mark and other currencies.
After a year of turbulence the year-end rates were watched particularly
closely.
Companies which draw up accounts at the end of the calendar year calculate
the value of their overseas subsidiaries using the closing rate in London on
December 31. In some cases overseas profits and losses will also be
translated to the parent group's balance sheet using the rates for that day.
Many treasury managers calculate profits and losses using the average
exchange rate over the accounting year. Even in these cases, however, the
year-end rate is usedas a guide to how the average will come out.
Mr Derek Ross, a partner at accountancy firm Touche Ross, said the overall
value of a company might change sharply because of sterling's devaluation.
'Those companies with net assets overseas will find that the value of their
holdings has increased because of sterling's devaluation.'
The devaluation implied in the year-end rate can also change a company's
gearing ratio and borrowing capacity. The debt-to-equity ratio can also
change, depending on the extent of a company's overseas holdings, and this
may have an impact on existing borrowing.
Mr Ross said that the recession had resulted in companies having larger
borrowings than usual. The devaluation as reflected in the the end-of-year
rates may have an adverse effect on gearing percentages.
British business will be in the front line of a new Battle of Britain this
year, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors said
in a New Year message to members.
'January 1 1993 is an important turning-point for the UK economy.
Symbolically, it brings the European single market into existence while in
real terms it opens a new year in which we do expect recovery from recession
to begin,' he said.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Ministers were embarrassed by ICI battle: Cabinet papers for
1962 reveal takeover bid row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' attempt to take over Courtaulds was the
biggest and most fiercely fought takeover battle of its day and the
Macmillan cabinet did not know how to handle it, according to cabinet papers
which have been released under the 30-year rule.
The aim was to rationalise the UK's synthetic fibres industry but Mr Frank
Kearton, then deputy chairman of Courtaulds, strongly resisted the plan and
a long series of secret negotiations broke down. The battle between Mr
Kearton and Mr Paul Chambers of ICI fascinated the City, particularly when
Courtaulds, having cut its interim dividend before the battle, proposed a
dividend increase and distribution to shareholders of Pounds 40m in loan
stock.
The government was an embarrassed spectator of the bitter in-fighting, and
the Labour opposition rejoiced in the daily revelations of jungle warfare in
the City. Cabinet papers show the scale of the disagreement among ministers
on whether to intervene.
Some ministers urged intervention to prevent an ICI monopoly but a majority
argued in favour of allowing the bid to run its course and for the
Monopolies Commission to step in at a later stage if necessary.
Mr Rab Butler, the home secretary, absented himself from the discussions as
he had married into the Courtaulds family.
Mr Frederick Erroll, president of the board of trade, publicly washed his
hands of the affair. He told the Commons he had decided not to decide
whether the merger would be in the national interest.
Fortunately for Mr Erroll the battle ended on the expiry of ICI's time limit
for Courtaulds shareholders, when only 37.4 per cent of Courtaulds ordinary
stock had been acquired.
Cabinet minutes show recognition that the dispute had crystallised growing
public anxiety about the effect of big mergers on the national interest, and
that ministers would be pressed to assume further powers to control these
operations.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Rush to buy holidays as sales surge continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON, THE UK's biggest tour operator, yesterday estimated that
holidaymakers spent about Pounds 75m in the first three days of this week on
summer bookings - about 50 per cent up on the same period last year.
The holiday rush, stimulated by price cuts and special offers, was
accompanied by further brisk business in the sales yesterday.
Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, said: 'Clearly consumer
confidence is now returning to the high street.'
Thomson, which expects total holiday bookings to reach Pounds 150m this
weekend, has doubled the size of its Skytours brochure, offering 200,000
additional holidays in Spain, Greece and the Canaries.
Thomas Cook confirmed the early surge in demand. Bookings through its 340
travel agencies were 50 per cent ahead of last year. 'We have had a very
good few days since Christmas,' it said.
Retailers reported an improvement on last year's start of the January sales.
Mr Robin Cannon, marketing director of Allied-Maples, said: 'It has been a
good day for us. The momentum has been maintained since Monday and augurs
well for the weekend. Carpet sales have been particularly buoyant.'
Lillywhites, the London sports store, reported business was 'a lot better'
than in last year's sale. Mr Steve Forbes, merchandise manager, said: 'For
the Christmas/New Year period as a whole, sales are 41 per cent ahead of our
forecasts and 140 per cent up on last year, when the redevelopment of the
store disrupted business.'
Gieves &amp; Hawkes, the Savile Row tailor, said it had fewer customers
yesterday than earlier in the week, but it was 'very pleased with the
results. The Christmas period this year has certainly been better than a
year ago.'
Mr Malcolm Busby, retail director of Daks-Simpson, said trading yesterday
had been 'quite brisk'. He added: 'Christmas got off to a slow start but
over the last two weeks business has been very much better than last year.'
The sale at Austin Reed's Regent Street store in London yesterday attracted
slightly more customers than last year. Mr Michael Tiffin, merchandise
director, said: 'There are noticeably more tourists among the shoppers.'
It had been a good week for the company's 34 shops throughout the country,
Mr Tiffin added. 'We are very pleased with the results.'
The John Lewis Partnership reported yesterday that its department stores had
increased sales by 0.7 per cent in the week to December 19, the last full
week before Christmas.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Hidden role in Cuban crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HAROLD Macmillan, the prime minister 30 years ago, felt the Cuban missile
crisis strengthened the country's special relationship with the US. This was
in spite of the British government's serious doubts about the legality of US
actions.
The prime minister's papers record daily phone calls between him and US
President John Kennedy.
Mr Macmillan later told the cabinet that the UK had played a more active
role in the resolution of the crisis than was widely believed. He hesitated
to publicise the fact for fear of embarrassing President Kennedy and further
antagonising Britain's European allies.
At one stage Mr Macmillan wrote to President Kennedy offering to immobilise
the UK's 60 Thor nuclear missiles as a face-saving gesture for Mr
Khrushchev, the Soviet leader. The crisis was resolved the following day
without such action being necessary.
Documents that have been removed indefinitely from the files made public
yesterday may hide evidence of whether a secret deal was responsible for the
sudden resolution of the situation.
Close co-operation with Washington did nothing to help British relations
with Europe when the UK was trying to join the European Economic Community,
but Mr Macmillan did not appear to consider this a problem.
He wrote in a memo: 'I am glad to feel that the crisis leaves us with
strengthened ties to the administration . . . I do not feel so inhibited by
our European negotiations because I am now beginning to feel that we shall
have a fight with de Gaulle (of France) and Adenauer (of West Germany)
anyway.'
A flurry of memos between senior members of the government reveals serious
doubts about whether the US blockade of Cuba was justifiable under
international law. The consensus appeared to be that it was not. The
government was particularly concerned about the possibility of setting a
precedent in international law for ships of a third-party nation to be
stopped and searched at sea.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Chirpy GMTV greets the nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A CONVENTIONAL breakfast show this isn't,' claimed the anchorman. At just
after 6am on New Year's Day not too many viewers were around to dispute this
proud boast for Good Morning Television, which yesterday took over the
breakfast franchise from TV-am.
On the first morning of ITV's Big Bang the GMTV formula for greeting the
nation appeared thoroughly conventional - cheerful, fast-paced, and
resolutely populist.
On Thursday, the last rather lugubrious morning for TV-am, one of the
sillier tributes paid was that the programme had stood for 'very visual
colour'. The set of GMTV is certainly highly visual - a sunburst-yellow
lounge with pink sofas and an Impressionist still-life.
The presenters are under 40 and as confident and chirpy as sparrows.
Predictably, the top news story of the morning was Princess Diana on the
Caribbean island of Nevis. GMTV had its own royal-watcher there who gushed
predictable twaddle. Items on Somalia and Slovakia came later.
Body culture looks like being an important ingredient in the morning recipe,
and not only features on health and exercise. A female fashion presenter
modelled stretchy black underwear in the studio and a female travel reporter
will do much of her work in a swimsuit.
Evidently GMTV has no aspirations to challenge its audience's intelligence.
The technology reporter ducked an explanation of how potatoes can contain
electricity by saying dismissively: 'Oh, it's all chemistry and that sort of
thing.' But it was a slick, confident debut.
Carlton Television's first contributions have been desperately banal.
Yesterday afternoon's Surprise Party, presented by Michael Parkinson, was a
reworking of This Is Your Life.
Richard Branson as the mystery personality was taken unctuously through his
glorious career.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Concern raised over South Georgia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REPORT to the cabinet raised concerns that a whaling deal could lead to
the south Atlantic island of South Georgia becoming populated entirely by
Japanese. The government felt it could not interfere in a commercial
transaction.
Housing was becoming a 'lively political issue' because of a shortage of
private rented homes and high interest rates.
Mr Rab Butler, the home secretary, warned of the risk of a 'big explosion'
of racial conflict if the government was not seen to take action after a
series of fascist meetings were broken up violently.
Rapid growth of office employment worried the home secretary. He feared the
concentration of offices in inner cities could lead to land shortages,
increased homelessness, traffic congestion and high travel costs.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Smith urges return to 'active government'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCING unemployment must be the overwhelming priority for this year, Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader, said yesterday as he accused the government
of complete inactivity on jobs.
He said Labour believed there should be a return to the idea of 'active
government' which could deal with the UK's problems by restoring the
manufacturing base, improving skill levels and providing better social
services.
He contrasted the opposition's view with that of Mr John Major, who was
simply 'keeping his fingers crossed' and hoping that something would happen.
Mr Smith said on BBC radio: 'There is no plan, no action, no drive on the
part of this government to tackle Britain's over-riding problem.
'We're determined to run a campaign to make sure there is the maximum
pressure on the government to make the next Budget a Budget for jobs and for
economic recovery.'
Mr Smith underlined Labour's commitment to an intensive campaign to force
the government to act on unemployment.
The campaign may help draw the party together and take the emphasis away
from likely areas of tension and division. Mr John Prescott, the shadow
transport secretary, said this week there were 'clear divisions' in the
party on proportional representation, Europe and trade union links.
Mr Prescott said that there were some party figures who seemed 'to be
wanting to believe that imagery and language are more important than the
substance of ideas. I reject that view.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / Matiba grows from prisoner to opposition leader: Profile of
the man who has come a strong second in Kenya's presidential poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE man who dominated the historic launch of Kenya's opposition coalition to
the continued rule of President Daniel arap Moi has earned his spurs the
hard way.
Mr Kenneth Matiba, who emerged in the elections as the leading popular
opposition figure, has one essential African qualification for power: a long
spell in jail for his opposition to authoritarian rule.
Detention without trial has done for Mr Matiba what it did for former
President Jomo Kenyatta, who was incarcerated by the British for his
challenge to colonial rule: it has made him a political martyr to Kenya's
masses, particularly his powerful and dominant Kikuyu tribe.
The 60-year-old former cabinet minister, jailed in 1990 by President Moi for
leading the multi-party democracy movement, has established himself as the
power broker of Kenya's political future.
Yesterday Mr Matiba, leader of the Ford-Asili party, was flanked by the two
other members of the coalition, Mr Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party and
Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga of Ford-Kenya - once bitter rivals of Mr Matiba
but now deferring to him as primus inter pares of the united opposition
front.
From the start of the campaign for multi-party democracy nearly three years
ago, Mr Matiba has displayed an almost messianic belief that this was the
leadership role he was destined to play.
He has battled Mr Moi since 1988, when he became the first minister to
resign from his cabinet over election rigging. Spearheading the nascent
multi-party movement, he was detained in July 1990, three days before tens
of thousands of people heeded his call to demonstrate for political change.
At least 40 people were killed in three days of rioting in Nairobi and
Central Province in the wake of arrest.
Now he has the opportunity to shape the opposition to Mr Moi and determine
whether Kenya's transition to democracy will be peaceful.
Interviewed in his campaign office, as it became apparent that he had become
a pivotal figure, Mr Matiba gave an early indication of his strategy to lead
the opposition and put aside the bitter rivalries which had emerged during
the campaign. 'The country does not want Moi any more,' he said. 'The
opposition have the majority of votes and we have to stop the violence which
is there already. I am the only man who can stop the violence and keep the
country together.'
Mr Matiba has made an extremely strong showing in three of Kenya's eight
provinces and can now claim the mantle of leadership of his Kikuyu tribe.
The Kikuyu have been the most militant in pressing for the introduction of
multi-party democracy, and observers say many are prepared to take to the
streets to remove Mr Moi forcibly if Mr Matiba issues the call.
Doubts about their possible return to power, after a 14-year break since Mr
Kenyatta's death, remain Mr Matiba's chief Achilles' heel.
Mr Matiba was last night firmly in second place behind his one-time jailer,
by 1,228,870 votes (26 per cent) to 1,796,233 (37 per cent), in the election
for the presidency. His remarkable performance among his Kik-uyu people in
the face of stiff competition from his fellow tribesman, Mr Kibaki, stems
from his status as the hero of the multi-party movement.
A strong family man and enthusiastic mountain climber, Mr Matiba suffered a
severe stroke shortly after his release from a 10-month confinement which
left the right side of his body seriously paralysed and affected his reading
and writing ability. He spent almost a year convalescing in London before
returning triumphantly to Nairobi last May.
At his country home in Limuru, he shows off the remarkable recovery he
attributes to God and stiff exercise. 'Look at this,' he says swishing the
air with an imaginary squash racket. 'I couldn't do that not so long ago.'
He is light-hearted, even schoolboyish.
Many Kenyans remember with affection his career before he entered parliament
in 1979, which was built on two of Africa's greatest enthusiasms: beer and
football.
As a senior executive and later chairman of Kenya Breweries between 1968 and
1979 he was responsible for massive industrial expansion and job creation in
one of Kenya biggest state-owned companies. As founder of the Kenya Football
League and chairman of the Kenya Football Federation he promoted Kenya's
most popular sport across the country.
His family and many of his close colleagues opposed his return to the
cut-throat world of Kenyan politics, and urged him to retire to the business
empire he has built up in hotels and horticulture exports.
But Mr Matiba felt he was the only man capable of leading the opposition to
Mr Moi and holding the country together - an almost De Gaulle-style
arrogance which was to win him many enemies in the opposition.
The results of the elections show that if the opposition had held together
instead of fragmenting into three main parties, based largely on tribalism
and personal greed for power, they would have easily swept Mr Moi aside.
Mr Matiba must bear some of the responsibility for this failure to present a
united front. He claims his rigid stance has been based on democratic
principle, repeatedly stressing that his was the only party to carry out
direct elections for the leadership. 'I have been for democracy from the
beginning and that was not up for compromise,' he says.
But politicians in the other opposition parties, including former close
friends like Mr Charles Rubia, who was detained with Mr Matiba in 1990 but
subsequently broke with him, say his prickly and volatile nature make it
impossible to work collectively with him.
An ironic parallel can be drawn, say his critics, between Mr Matiba and his
close British friend Dr David Owen, the former leader of the Social
Democrats: both men whose personalities led to divisions in the opposition.
His policies, too, are close to those of Dr Owen, mixing a commitment to
private sector enterprise and privatisation of state-owned companies with a
belief in the social welfare role of the modern state, especially in
education, and accountability in public affairs.
Critical for Kenya is whether Mr Matiba can now rise to the challenge of
opposition leadership bestowed on him by the electorate, and play the role
of conciliator to unite a fragmented opposition still groping for a path to
power.

The US Food and Drug Administration ended the year by publishing its
long-awaited rules for the labelling of bottled water, Nikki Tait reports
from New York.
Under the proposed new rules mineral water will be defined as bottled water
with at least 250 parts per million in total dissolved solids, coming from a
source 'tapped at one of more bore holes or springs, originating from a
geologically and physically protected underground water source'.
Spring water, meanwhile, is defined as bottled water obtained from an
underground formation from which the water flows naturally to the surface -
or would if it were not collected underground.

THE US manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, according to a

The National Association of Purchasing Managers index rose for the third
consecutive month to 55.9 per cent, and a NAPM index of new orders climbed
sharply to its highest level for three years.
Separately, the Commerce Department said manufacturers' new orders declined
by 0.9 per cent in November, the first drop in three months. Economists
said, however, that this decline was mostly attributable to aircraft orders,
which tend to fluctuate erratically. Factory shipments rose by 1.1 per cent
in November.

<TEXT>
US-led forces yesterday warned warring factions in Somalia against any
further use of heavy weapons after two clans exchanged artillery, mortar and
heavy machine-gun fire for three hours on New Year's Eve, Agencies report
from Mogadishu.
The clashes on the outskirts of Mogadishu - which came on President George
Bush's first night in Somalia - left at least 17 people dead on one side
alone, according to US Marine officials.
The fighting was a minor clan's attempt to become a participant in peace
talks, a United Nations official said. The UN also said one of Somalia's two
main warlords was dragging his feet on attending a peace conference in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, next week.
The fighting and threat of a conference boycott gave Mr Bush a glimpse of
the rivalries and bloodshed that have plunged Somalia into humanitarian
crisis, clan warfare, looting and famine.
Mr Bush saw the devastated interior of the country yesterday when he visited
Baidoa, 190km west of Mogadishu, where he was greeted by cheering youngsters
and foreign relief workers at an orphanage.
He thanked US troops for their relief efforts in Somalia but warned that he
and President-elect Bill Clinton agreed America should not act as the
world's watchdog.
Asked by a Marine if the US would take similar action in the future, Mr Bush
shook his head. 'I would have to say to you it would be a special case
because of the enormity of it,' he said.
The New Year's Eve fighting, which lit up the night sky and resumed briefly
yesterday morning, broke out when the Murursade clan, led by Mohamed
Kanyare, tried to seize a barracks belonging to one of the main warlords,
Gen Mohamed Farrah Aidid.
US Marine Col Michael Hagee said Mr Aidid's forces lost 17 fighters, with 25
wounded. He did not have figures for the other side.
Hospital doctors said up to 35 people, including several children, were
wounded.

ISRAEL'S parliament yesterday approved the 1993 state budget, the first
under Labour Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, after a marathon all-night
session, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The vote was 44-36.
The Shk102bn (Pounds 24.3bn) budget aims to ease 11 per cent unemployment by
creating 90,000 jobs, mainly through infrastructure and business incentive
allocations totalling Shk6.4bn.
Inflation was forecast to remain steady at 10 per cent.
The government abolished a Shk250 travel tax, a 4 per cent fee on foreign
currency purchases, and customs duty on products from the European Free
Trade Association countries. It reduced value added tax from 18 to 17 per
cent and company taxes from 40 to 39 per cent.
Defence, at Shk18.2bn, is the largest item in the operating budget. In the
overall budget, debt repayment takes the largest allocation, at 29 per cent,
followed by 26 per cent for welfare and transfer payments. Defence accounts
for 18 per cent of the overall budget.
The deficit, which by law must be wiped out by 1995, is projected at 3.2 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1993, compared to the 1992 projection of
6.2 per cent. GDP, up 6.4 per cent in 1992, is predicted to increase by 3.5
per cent in 1993.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Brazilian growth plan prepared: Government wants to cut
inflation and create 4m jobs in two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S new government has outlined a general strategy to promote growth
and reduce inflation.
But the scheme for achieving these goals, presented by Mr Paulo Haddad,
planning minister, was short on details. He failed to address structural
reforms such as privatisation, a programme which President Itamar Franco
suspended and promised to re-initiate under unspecified new rules.
The key points included the elimination of public waste and corruption
through increased oversight and administrative decentralisation, a gradual
reduction of interest rates, tripartite sectoral accords negotiated with
business and labour, and the liberalisation of certain investment rules to
attract foreign capital.
Mr Franco hopes to generate 4m jobs during the two years left of the term he
inherited from Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned last week.
The government estimates that there are 8m unemployed in Brazil's big
cities.
The government aims to cut inflation from 25 to 10 per cent a month by the
end of 1993, and to what Mr Haddad called 'civilised levels', 2-4 per cent a
month by December 1994.
The strategy for 'selective growth', as Mr Haddad put it, partly depends on
the co-operation of business and labour. The model will be an accord last
year in the automotive sector, where industry reduced prices and guaranteed
job stability, labour moderated salary demands, and the government cut
taxes.
Mr Franco is calling Congress back from its summer recess on January 11 to
address fiscal reform. Reform would also make room for the gradual reduction
of interest rates, said Mr Haddad.

VERNOR Chris Patten ordered an inquiry yesterday into a New Year stampede in
which 20 young revellers were trampled to death, saying lessons must be
learnt before the Chinese New Year festival in three weeks, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
The victims, including two teenagers believed to be British and a Japanese,
perished as more than 15,000 revellers poured into a narrow, beer-slickened
street after the stroke of midnight.
Three of 17 people admitted to hospital were in a critical condition,
officials said.
Police watched helplessly for several minutes, unable to reach the mostly
teenage victims who one officer said simply dropped from sight to be crushed
underfoot.
Mr Patten said the inquiry, under high court judge Kemal Bokhary, should
start early next week, as speed was essential to avoid similar chaos at the
Lunar New Year, which has been marked by tragedies for two years running.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Hijacker puts US in quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US officials are pondering what to do with the Cuban pilot who this week
hijacked his aircraft and flew to Miami, taking with him 48 willing
defectors and also some passengers and crew members who were diverted
against their will.
The case again places the US government in a quandary as a result of its
enduring feud with Mr Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader.
While Washington welcomes any refugee from the Castro government, it is
reluctant to appear to condone hijacking, and some US airlines are agitated
about the possible precedent.
The Cuban American National Foundation, a right-wing grouping of Cuban
exiles headed by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman, has hired a
lawyer to represent the pilot, Mr Carlos Cancio, and is acting as Mr
Cancio's interpreter in interviews.
But the episode has also highlighted the contradiction between the open arms
the US extends to any Cuban defector, and the cold shoulder it has turned to
thousands of Haitian refugees from the military regime that ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991.
The US policy of forcing Haitian refugees to return home is justified by the
argument that they are, for the most part, fleeing economic misery rather
than the political persecution that faces their Cuban counterparts.
Human rights observers, however, say the US position is at best rooted in
the distinction that Cuban oppression is communist, rather than merely
totalitarian, and at worst in the fact that most Cuban defectors are white
and relatively well educated, while most Haitians are black.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, has said the country must
concentrate on developing its political role in Asia, signalling that Tokyo
will increasingly pursue policies independent of the US.
In a New Year statement, Mr Miyazawa said Asia would be 'the world's
brightest spot over the next century', and Japan must cultivate its own
policies to take advantage of the changes in the region.
His comments follow the delivery of reports by two senior advisory panels
recommending that the relationship with the US be redefined and that 'a new
way of thinking' be employed in dealing with Asian countries.
The New Year comments and the publication of the panel reports are part of
the build-up to a South-East Asian tour by Mr Miyazawa beginning on January
11.
While careful to show deference to US influence in Asia, Japan is trying to
convince other Asian governments that Tokyo will not necessarily fall in
line behind Washington in the future.
At the same time, most Japanese apparently sense that there are troubles
ahead with the US. A poll published yesterday by the Mainichi Shimbun found
that only 6 per cent of questioned Japanese consider ties with the US will
improve in the future.
In addition, Mr Miyazawa presided over a 'round table on Japan and the
Asia-Pacific region', which has just reported that 'it is indefensible to
adopt the attitude that a nation can curl up comfortably into its own
cocoon' in the face of international change.
But the conference also suggested Japan must make changes at home to ensure
that it can be taken seriously abroad.
Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa said Japan's reluctance to open the rice market to
imports was not a cause of the delay in settling the Uruguay Round of
multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He said Japan should 'defend' the rice market, though, recognising that a
market opening appears inevitable, he also suggested that farmers be
compensated if their earnings are affected by trade liberalisation.

FT  02 JAN 93 / N-weapons deal will cap Bush-Yeltsin summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush will arrive in Moscow this evening for a farewell
summit meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It is to be capped by
the signature of an historic agreement cutting the US and Russian nuclear
arsenals by around two thirds.
They are expected also to discuss Russia's economic reforms, as well as
relations with other former Soviet republics - especially Ukraine, whose
failure to fulfil its pledge to get rid of the nuclear weapons on its soil
is viewed in Washington as one of the most critical threats to efforts to
control the nuclear threat.
But Mr Bush has less than three weeks to serve before he hands over power to
President-elect Bill Clinton, so little of substance is likely to be
transacted.
Nevertheless, diplomats in Washington expect Mr Bush to use the meeting to
press for Mr Yeltsin's co-operation in stepping up pressure on Serbia to end
hostilities in Bosnia.
On his way home, Mr Bush will stop in Paris for dinner with President
Francois Mitterrand, and will try to win his backing for a tough UN
resolution allowing the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia - as he
sought that of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, at a meeting last
month in the US.
The broad outlines of the nuclear missiles agreement which Mr Bush and Mr
Yeltsin will sign tomorrow, known as Start II because it builds on the
framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed by the two
superpowers in 1991, were agreed at their last summit in Washington in June.
The US and Russia have agreed to deploy no more than 3,000-3,500 strategic
nuclear warheads by the year 2003, with a separate limit of 1,750 warheads
deployed on submarine-launched missiles and a complete ban on the use of
multiple warheads, known as Mirvs, on land-based missiles.
It has taken six months to resolve technical disagreements over issues such
as the conversion of silos protecting one banned type of missile to enable
them to house smaller missiles, but US officials said the delay in
completing Start II has also reflected Mr Yeltsin's difficulty in selling
the agreement to his military commanders and to nationalist politicians on
his right.
The agreement throws out the principle of strict parity that has pervaded
earlier US-Soviet arms treaties by setting a band of 3,000 to 3,500
warheads.
Mr Yeltsin said in June he intended Russia to aim for the lower end of this
band, while the US is expected to end up closer to the upper limit.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Vulnerable punt faces a rough start to year: Abolition of
exchange controls raises risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first currency to come under attack after a quiet Christmas could be the
Irish punt, as foreign exchange dealers brace themselves for a new year of
speculation against the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Trading on the foreign exchanges was so thin last week that most exchange
rates were motionless. But the Bundesbank's unwillingness to ease monetary
policy and uncertainty about the future of the ERM left the Irish currency
looking beleaguered.
On New Year's Eve, the punt was trading at DM2.6315 against the D-Mark,
close to its ERM floor of DM2.6190. In the last few days the punt has been
alternating with the system's other weak currency - the French franc - at
the bottom of the ERM grid.
The punt's vulnerability has been heightened by new dangers. Yesterday, the
Irish authorities carried out their pledge to abolish the country's
remaining exchange controls, in line with the EC's single market programme.
It was, in the words of one Irish currency dealer, 'an extraordinarily brave
decision'.
Until this weekend the controls had meant that foreign investors who wanted
to trade in the punt had to deal in the less liquid Euromarket. Now
non-residents can borrow punts in Ireland's domestic market, thereby
enhancing their ability to speculate in the currency.
The arrival of the new year also brings clean balance sheets to many bank
dealers.
As the end of 1992 approached, dealers were reluctant to take big positions
in the market for fear of losing the gains made in the summer currency
crisis and spoiling what, in many cases, were excellent end-of-year results.
But some analysts believe the currency market is on the verge of renewed
speculation.
Like the French franc, the punt ought not to be a candidate for devaluation
against the D-Mark. Ireland's inflation rate for 1992 is about 2.7 per cent,
well below Germany's. The country's current account balance is also in
surplus.
This is all but ignored by dealers. The punt is under pressure because of
investor confidence in the D-Mark as a currency which has never been
devalued and which offers a high return, with short-term interest of about
8.75 per cent.
Analysts also believe the punt will have to be devalued by about 7 per cent
to make up for the competitive devaluation of sterling earlier in the year.
Britain remains Ireland's biggest trading partner, accounting for 33 per
cent of the Irish export market, and last year's 10 per cent revaluation of
the punt against sterling has made life difficult for Ireland's exporters.
Mr Steve Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes pressure
on the Irish currency is now so great that the EC's monetary committee may
be forced to consider a devaluation of the currency as early as this
weekend.
However, Mr Nick Hunt, head of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of
Ireland in Dublin, says that speculation against the currency will not be
easy, with Ireland's money market remaining illiquid due to large-scale
selling of the punt to the central bank in recent months.
Speculators make a profit on a devaluation by borrowing the currency,
selling it at the prevailing exchange rate and buying it back when it is at
the lower rate.
Mr Hunt says that most dealers will be forced to borrow money from the
central bank as the interbank market is so illiquid. 'The central bank has
already made clear that it will lend at increasingly high rates if it sees
sustained pressure on the currency.'
With the overnight support rate at about 14 per cent, the central bank can
ill afford to raise the price at which it is lending money to the domestic
market, for fear of squeezing the country's economy.
But there may be limits to the price investors will pay to borrow a currency
in the hope that it will be devalued.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Truckers wary of their new freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John McCann's 38-tonne refrigerated truck was one of two dozen commercial
vehicles on board the Pride of Kent, the first ferry to dock at Dover after
the removal of border controls at midnight on December 31.
He had hoped for an earlier arrival in Britain but when he made his usual
two-hour detour to Steenvoorde on the Belgian border to pick up his
documents, the clearing agents had jumped the gun on the single market and
had stopped issuing them. They advised him to wait for the first boat
arriving after midnight, when the papers would no longer be necessary.
Agents are private companies that prepare export and import documents for
customs. For years Mr McCann went to Steenvoorde because clearing agents
there were open at more convenient times than those in Calais.
Creation of the single market means most of the 55m customs documents for
trade within the European Community will no longer be needed.
Mr McCann, a driver for 20 years, said the removal of routine customs checks
at borders would be a 'big improvement' although he was unsure whether there
would still be controls on food health certificates. (Customs said later any
checks would be carried out on factory premises).
However, uncertainty abounds about the impact of the changes.
Mr Kenneth Ross-Steven, whose cargo of Dutch chicken livers was the last
truckload to pass through Dover under the pre-single market system of
controls, clutched a wad of documentation. He is concerned about any easing
of health controls and the pace of change. 'We were just getting used to the
old system where we knew what we were doing.'
Another of his fears is that customs posts elsewhere in Europe will not be
prepared to clear drivers without the traditional documentation. And with
many clearing agents around Europe going out of business advice may be
difficult to get if problems arise.
British Customs and Excise officers, however, are convinced of the benefits.
Mr Derek Leach, in charge of VAT, excise and duty collection on freight
traffic, said customs officers in Dover handled about 2.5m import and export
documents a year. These would be reduced to about 300,000 documents, mainly
covering non-EC shipments, he estimated. Checks for smuggling will be
carried out only on suspicious vehicles.
This has led to the loss of 550 customs jobs at Dover, Ramsgate, Folkestone
and Sheerness, although most staff have been transferred to other jobs or
will move to the Channel tunnel when it opens.
But even the removal of most customs controls will not mean drivers have a
completely free run. The immigration department has taken over some of the
space occupied by customs. And controls on drivers' hours remain; Mr
Ross-Steven had to wait 11 hours in Dover yesterday because of EC tachograph
rules.

Reuter reports from Paris.
The prime minister's office said the cost of the project would be cut to
less than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.43bn), from earlier estimates of FFr35bn. The
construction schedule will be released next month.
The new railway, completing a network of 160-190mph trains running south,
west and north from Paris, should put Strasbourg less than two hours from
Paris by the end of the century and eventually extend towards northern and
eastern Europe. The European Community is to provide some financing.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Reality belies the European dream: Political compromises and
confusion likely to delay a barrier-free common market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday became a 12-nation single market but was
forced to concede that the free movement of people, goods, capital and
services within the EC was not yet a reality.
All internal EC border checks on goods were abolished at midnight on
December 31, and the European Commission declared that the Community had
adopted 95 per cent of the 300 measures proposed when the single-market
project was launched in 1985. Six members of the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) are set to join the free-trade area during 1993 when the
European Economic Area comes into being.
But in practice, confusion, omissions, delays and the inevitable political
compromises mean the Community is unlikely to realise the aim of the 1957
Treaty of Rome - to establish a barrier-free European common market - before
the end of the millennium.
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, declined to fete the
arrival of the market. He argued that it would not be appropriate and that
as a gradual process the single-market project was never supposed to end
with a 'big bang' on January 1 1993.
In a statement released yesterday, he said: 'We shall have to display a more
active presence together in global affairs relating to peace, liberty,
respect for others and solidarity with the poor worldwide. The task is
immense but it can be carried out successfully.'
For the EC's 344m inhabitants - and travellers within the Community - the
immediate effect of the legislation that came into force yesterday will be
limited. The main change is the abolition of limits on the goods individuals
can carry across internal borders.
Travellers can now return home with as much alcohol, tobacco and other goods
as they want, having paid tax where they bought the items. But national
authorities can carry out spot-checks and seek proof that the goods are for
personal use or consumption.
For many regular travellers within the EC, the greatest disappointment will
be the failure of member states to lift passport checks at internal
frontiers.
Passengers on flights within the EC will still have to show passports at
airports until December at least, when most terminals should have adapted to
the changes. Nine continental members of the EC will try to abolish other
controls on people by the middle of this year, if external frontier controls
are strengthened. But Britain, Denmark and Ireland could well persist with
passport checks beyond 1993.
To a large extent, EC businesses have already adapted to the single market.
Its announcement helped fuel the boom of the late 1980s and many companies
have already restructured to take account of existing and proposed
legislation lifting barriers to trade.
Exchange controls in all but four EC members were lifted by mid-1990, for
example. Ireland yesterday joined Portugal and Spain in lifting controls
reimposed during the autumn currency crisis. Only Greece has been granted a
delay in liberalising capital movements.
Alongside the abolition of border controls on goods, yesterday was the
birthday of a new system for collecting and monitoring value added tax and
excise duty. The new regime abolishes 60m forms which had to be filled in by
business each year, but traders complain that new administrative burdens
have been imposed. They also fear confusion about the application of the new
rules will undermine its benefits during the first few months of operation.
From now on EC banks are also free to set up branches anywhere in the
Community, and government curbs on the setting of air fares have been lifted
 -a move which could herald cheaper air travel. Utilities and public
authorities also have to open all contracts, except those in services, to
competition.
But recent breakthroughs allowing stockbrokers and banks to deal on stock
exchanges across Europe will not come into force until 1996 at the earliest,
and legislation enabling insurance companies to set up anywhere and sell
policies across borders does not take effect until 1994.

COAL miners at 65 Polish pits are to vote on Monday on a New Year's Eve
agreement between strike leaders and the government which could end the most
widespread stoppage in the industry's history, writes Christopher Bobinski
in Warsaw.
The protocol commits the government to restructuring the coal mines' debt of
8,000bn zlotys (Pounds 334m) and providing subsidies worth 1,700bn zlotys.
The government has also said it will turn to international financial
institutions for modernisation loans for the industry.
The end of the 19-day strike would see the resumption of coal exports, which
the government banned last week in view of possible domestic fuel shortages.

MR Vladimir Meciar, the first prime minister of newly independent Slovakia,
appealed yesterday to Slovaks of all ethnic origins to rally behind the new
country and build a legal, democratic and decentralised state.
In a televised address to the nation from the capital, Bratislava, he called
on 'all Slovaks, and Hungarian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Ruthenian and
Romany (gypsy) minorities, all the citizens of the Slovak Republic,' to work
together.
In Prague, now the capital of the independent Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the prime minister, pledged to maintain close ties with Slovakia,
formerly the junior partner in the 74-year-old federal Czechoslovak state,
which was formally dissolved at midnight on December 31.
Mr Klaus said in a speech to political and religious leaders in Prague
castle that there would be 'no Chinese wall' along the common frontier. He
underlined that Slovakia's economic prosperity and the maintenance of
political pluralism was also a political concern for the Czech Republic.
Mr Meciar acknowledged, in a speech which implicitly recognised the fears
and reservations that many Slovaks harbour about the ending of the link with
the more prosperous Czech Republic, that difficulties lay ahead for the
smaller of the two new states. He assured Slovaks that links with the Czech
Republic would continue to be close and that Slovakia 'needed neither
customs officers nor border crossings and other restrictions'.
Both leaders underlined the difficulty of predicting the exact course of
their future relationship. Mr Meciar pledged to honour all obligations
assumed during the six months the two states moved apart and to co-operate
at the highest possible level.
He and other leading Slovaks attended independence celebrations in
Bratislava's central square, which began with the hoisting of the new flag
and the singing of the national anthem. Thousands of people turned out to
usher in both the new year and the new state.
Under a placard saying: 'Kiss me, I'm Slovak,' one of the throng caught the
mood of the night. She said it was a special moment for all Slovaks, as
people queued to smother her with kisses. Then, to the strains of The Blue
Danube, the singing and dancing continued into the night.
In his speech the Slovak leader stressed the importance of relations with
Austria, and underlined Slovakia's 'permanent and sincere interest in good
relations' with Hungary. In a reference to the economic difficulties facing
Slovakia, whose heavy and arms-related industries were built largely to
serve the former Soviet and Comecon markets, he warned there was 'a lot to
learn'.
Mr Meciar, a former communist, said it was necessary to 'draw a thick line
between the present and the past'. While the 'velvet revolution' of November
1989 had rejected a system that was bad, 'we cannot reject the work of those
who worked honestly under this bad system' - an indication that he will not
permit a clean break with communist-style methods favoured by the
free-market orientated Czech government.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Bosnian faction leaders gather for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

THE first face-to-face talks between leaders of the three warring factions
in Bosnia-Hercegovina since hostilities began last spring open today in
Geneva, amid mounting international pressure for outside military
intervention to halt Serb aggression.
The talks, due to break on Tuesday before resuming later this month, are
aimed at thrashing out a political settlement for Bosnia based on the draft
constitution prepared by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international
mediators, last October.
This provides for a decentralised political structure, comprising between
seven and 10 largely autonomous provinces based on geographical, economic
and historical factors as well as ethnic composition and strong human and
minority rights guarantees.
Attending today's meeting will be Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of the
mainly Moslem Bosnian government, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader,
and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. President Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will also be represented.
While the politicians discuss Bosnia's constitutional future, and in
particular where the provincial boundaries should be drawn, their military
advisers will continue talks begun under UN auspices in the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo. These will focus on the demilitarisation of the city, a reduction
of hostilities throughout Bosnia and a lifting of the siege on Moslem-held
towns.
Expressing fears that talk of military intervention could undermine the
Geneva negotiations, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general, this week described today's historic meeting as a 'last
chance' for the peace process.
However, Mr Vance and Lord Owen are said to see it as a 'first chance' for
top-level negotiations between the protagonists, in which a Bosnian
settlement would pave the way for a broader regional accord.
The talks, which are the culmination of four months of painstaking
peace-broking by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, follow last month's elections in
Serbia which confirmed hardline President Slobodan Milosevic in power, and
the reluctant acquiescence by Mr Izetbegovic to sit down at the same table
as Mr Karadzic whom he (and the US administration) labels a war criminal.
The Bosnian government and Bosnian Croats are said to have moved closer in
talks last weekend to drawing provincial boundaries, and Mr Vance and Lord
Owen will have their own map in readiness to move the bargaining process
along.
But when Lord Owen met Mr Karadzic and Mr Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday
there was no detectable sign of flexibility in Serb demands for a single
Bosnian Serb 'state-within-a-state' which could at some stage become part of
a Greater Serbia.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Major sees clear UK recovery this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR predicted yesterday that 1993 would bring clear economic
recovery in the UK and could mark the start of a 'virtuous cycle' of
sustainable growth and prosperity.
The prime minister promised that the government would seek a closer
relationship with industry and commerce, and raised the prospect of a
revival in areas of the UK's manufacturing base.
Interviewed on BBC radio's The World at One, Mr Major admitted that 1992 had
been a miserable year for many people. Fear of unemployment was one of the
brakes on restoring confidence - the task for 1993 was to bring hope to
people who had lost their jobs.
Comparing the current position with the beginning of the 1980s, Mr Major
held out the prospect of a number of years with steady and sustainable
growth. Progress had been made in laying the foundation for recovery, he
said, putting particular stress on the low inflation level.
He looked to the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses to create
jobs, as they had done in the early 1980s. He said 400,000 businesses had
been started even in the difficult circumstances of last year.
Mr Major promised further promotion of vocational qualifications, and
forecast a broadening of the UK's industrial base. 'There are areas of
manufacturing where I think we can begin to re-enter manufacturing . . . and
that is not just a question of investment, it is partly a question of
attitude.'
His positive tone is part of a continuing move by the government to
re-emphasise the importance of manufacturing. Earlier this week, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, said the UK's manufacturing performance should be 'a
source of confidence and pride'.
It follows a signal last month that the Budget would focus on measures to
underpin industrial investment, and offer particular help to small
businesses and exporters which have suffered in the recession.
Downing Street said the European single market and the completion of the
agreement on international trade meant that the coming months would be a
time of great challenges for business, and that Mr Major wanted the
government to try to ensure that British industry did not miss out on the
opportunities.
Mr Major spelt out his continued support for Mr Lamont as chancellor,
despite sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. That
had resulted from events beyond the chancellor's control, Mr Major said -
the Danish referendum, uncertainties surrounding the French referendum, and
'infelicitous' briefing by the Bundesbank which directed the markets towards
sterling.
The prime minister's determination to seize the initiative on the domestic
agenda and put behind him the past few months in which the government was
widely perceived as at the mercy of events, was also explicit. He underlined
his commitment to further education and health reforms, but was more
cautious in his language on privatising British Rail, while insisting that
the legislation would be passed by parliament this year.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, rejected Mr Major's sighting of increased
economic confidence, saying that the government still failed to appreciate
that the fear of unemployment was the fundamental barrier to a restoration
of confidence.
He recalled previous ministerial forecasts: 'The Conservative party's
promises about economic recovery are the biggest devalued currency of our
time.'

FT  02 JAN 93 / Single market brings air fare cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAPER AIR fares arrived in the single European market right on schedule
yesterday as Lufthansa, the German state carrier, began selling cut price
return tickets between every European Community member state and a dozen
German cities.
Passengers can now, for a limited period, fly from the UK to Germany for
Pounds 99 return and from France for FFr999 return. The lowest scheduled
fare between the UK and Germany was previously about Pounds 125.
Lufthansa's move has already prompted three other airlines - Air France, KLM
of the Netherlands, and Copenhagen-based Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) -
to match the cuts, although only on economy flights to Germany. British
Airways says it has no plans to follow suit.
The cuts have been made possible by the Third Airline Liberalisation
package, agreed last summer by EC members. Under the rules, fares can be
changed without consulting governments first. Only if governments at both
ends of the route disapprove of a new fare must it be withdrawn.
The Lufthansa cut-price offer applies to economy tickets sold before January
15 and is valid for flights until March 31.
This could be followed by further offers by carriers as they adapt to the
newly-liberalised market.
Lufthansa prepared its pan-EC marketing assault amid strict secrecy. By its
own admission it is more associated with business class customers and high
ticket prices and wanted to maximise the element of surprise.
The venture is already a success, it claims. In the first two days of
promotion, Lufthansa's London offices received double the number of
telephone inquiries than normal for the time of year.
Technology has also come to the aid of the airline.
'We have electronic filing systems to computer reservations networks. We can
announce a price cut today and be selling the tickets tomorrow,' said Mr
Frank Zehle, Lufthansa's marketing manager for Great Britain and Ireland.
It is not yet clear whether European fares can fall as far as they did in
the US after deregulation in the 1970s. Landing fees, air traffic control
charges and wages are often higher in Europe.
On the other hand, many European carriers are state-owned and may be able to
sustain losses longer than privately-owned companies.
The combined losses of European airlines last year were Dollars 1.3bn.
Airline traffic has yet to show a sustained recovery following the slump
caused by the Gulf crisis and the recession.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Groupe Bull offshoot seeks to win back Dollars 740m US deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENITH Data Systems is seeking to regain Desktop Four, the Dollars 740m
(Pounds 487m) US air force personal computer contract awarded under new
Pentagon procedures designed to speed procurement.
ZDS, the US-based PC arm of Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer
maker, was denied the contract on Christmas Eve after appeals against the
award were upheld.
Mr Thomas Buchsbaum, ZDS federal systems vice-president, said: 'Even though
two out of the mass of protests were granted, we are still in a better
position than anyone else on Desktop Four'.
Desktop Four is being closely watched as the first example of the Pentagon's
fast-track procurement policy. For Groupe Bull, still losing money heavily,
it represents additional revenue and a powerful confidence booster.
The contract was let first in 1991 to two US companies, CompuAdd and Sysorex
Information Systems. When appeals against that decision were upheld, the
contract was given to ZDS in September 1992.
Competitors including Compu-Add and Apple again appealed but ZDS, which
supplied PCs under Desktop One and Desktop Two, believed its position was
safe. It was surprised last week when the appeals were upheld. Desktop Three
went to other vendors.
The appeals board has now published excerpts from its ruling which show that
ZDS failed on two counts: First, the video monitor it proposed to supply
with the 300,000 PCs in the contract did not comply with the Trade
Agreements Act, a measure designed to ensure substantial US labour content
in systems assembled from offshore components. Second, the board did not
believe the Air Force had given enough consideration to sourcing its PCs
from more than one supplier.
Mr Buchsbaum said ZDS intended to appeal against both rulings. He said he
was certain ZDS monitors met and exceeded the legal requirements of the
Trade Agreements Act. There were well-recognised benefits to the government
of a single vendor policy including lower prices, greater compatibility
between systems and decreased training requirements.
Mr Robert Dornan of Federal Sources, a marketing consultancy specialising in
government business, said the onus now lay on the Air Force to clarify its
requirements.
