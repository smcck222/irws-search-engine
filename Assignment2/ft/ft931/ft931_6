FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine hints at coal supply deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE hopes to set out on Thursday his proposals for
Britain's coal industry in a white paper that will identify scope for
increasing the market for coal without specifying how many pits will be
saved.
The trade and industry secretary gave a clear hint yesterday that he
believed base contracts between British Coal and electricity generators can
be agreed before Thursday's cabinet meeting. That would pave the way for Mr
Heseltine to set out the broad outline of how some of the 31 coal pits
scheduled for closure could be saved - including via a Treasury subsidy - in
the hope of heading off a threatened revolt by Tory MPs.
If the government does publish its white paper on Thursday it may have to
soften demands that the electricity companies and British Coal first sign
contracts for coal.
In spite of significant progress in talks over the weekend and yesterday,
several minor issues remain to be resolved.
Some companies do not believe it is possible to sign by Thursday - others
remain reluctant until they see the white paper.
Mr Heseltine may have to content himself with a statement to the Commons
saying the heads of companies will sign shortly.
Mr Heseltine's hint came after Mr John Major chaired a meeting of ministers,
including the trade and industry secretary and Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, that lasted nearly three hours. A cabinet committee meets again
today.
However, the white paper will not include any deal on the generators buying
more coal over and above the levels agreed when British Coal announced its
pit closure programme last October. Averting pit closures will thus still
depend on reaching further agreements with generators.
Ministers have floated the possibility of up to a dozen pits being saved,
possibly only for a couple of years. That would probably satisfy many of the
potential rebels on the Conservative benches.
The white paper strategy will enable British Coal to close pits over a
period of months, a move likely to weaken opposition. Mr Heseltine has taken
soundings from across his party and met more Tory MPs last night - as well
as a delegation from the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. A Commons vote on
the proposals will almost certainly be delayed until after the Easter
recess.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Anticipated job losses as result of
council budget cuts reach 34,643
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, yesterday claimed that
anticipated job losses as a result of council budget cuts have now reached
34,643 since February. Mr Straw (above left) with Mr Frank Dobson, the
shadow employment spokesman, said monitoring by the Centre for Local
Economic Strategies had also shown a 'knock-on' effect from the cuts hitting
employment in the private sector. Mr Robin Squire, the environment minister,
replied that many of the 'losses' could be attributed to contracting-out of
services

FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont rallies Tories on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government secured a majority of 25 in the Commons last night for its
controversial proposal to extend value added tax to domestic fuel from April
of next year. The government's majority of seats over all other parties is
20.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, won congratulations from cabinet
colleagues and Tory backbenchers when he wound up the four-day Budget debate
with a hard-hitting speech which appeared to have strengthened his hold on
the chancellorship.
Earlier Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, alleged that the government had
deliberately massaged downwards its pre-election forecasts of public
borrowing.
Drawing on a report first published in the Financial Times last autumn Mr
Brown demanded publication of internal Treasury documents showing that the
chancellor had rejected as too high his officials' first forecast of the
public-sector borrowing requirement. In a rowdy end to the debate Mr Lamont
refused to be intimidated by persistent Labour barracking in support of
demands that all retirement pensioners should be compensated in full for the
increase in fuel charges resulting from the VAT levy.
He ruled out such across-the-board payments, reaffirming that relief planned
by the government through increased income support would be targeted on
those most in need. To government cheers he insisted: 'This party has an
excellent record in helping the worst-off'.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, was among several Tory
backbenchers who pressed for more generous compensation covering categories
marginally above entitlement to income support.
He stressed that those 'just above' the qualifying level for income support
would also be hard hit by the new impost.
The VAT resolution was carried by 303 votes to 278, with the numbers passing
through the government lobby three short of the total (306) which enabled it
to secure a majority of 27 to beat off an opposition challenge to the entire
Budget package.
Mr Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield) and Mr William Powell (C Corby)
abstained in the VAT vote, when the government's majority fell to 25. Mr
Michael Alison (C Selby) did not vote.
The chancellor vigorously rebutted charges that the tax increases imposed in
the Budget amounted to a betrayal of election promises by insisting that its
commitment to 'sound finances and low direct taxation' took priority.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: More cogitation than agitation -
The birth of the first 'holistic' think tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEAD-ON assault on Britain's political system and the disillusionment it
engenders begins in London today with the launch of a progressive
non-partisan think tank committed to affirmative, if intellectual, action
for change.
If nothing else, Demos, the brainchild of Mr Martin Jacques, one-time editor
of Marxism Today, and Mr Geoff Mulgan, a former aide to Mr Gordon Brown, the
shadow chancellor, is a courageous and ambitious creation.
Its advance publicity promises nothing less than 'to inject a new vitality
into the political world' and to be 'the first political think tank for the
21st century'.
Such claims are certain to fuel the cynicism that Demos hopes to cure. But,
by bringing together business people with the impecunious chattering
classes, the enterprise has at least succeeded in meeting its initial
funding target of Pounds 180,000.
Beyond rounding up many familiar faces from past crusades for change
(Professors Stuart Hall and David Marquand to name two), Messrs Jacques and
Mulgan have also persuaded figures like Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive
and chairman-designate of Courtaulds Textiles and Ms Yve Newbold, company
secretary of Hanson, to endorse their product by joining Demos's advisory
council.
A four-page explanation of its goals says politics has become a cultural
backwater 'defensive, unimaginative and no longer able to attract the
brightest and the best', while the traditional parties fail to lead but
merely react - often years too late - to events.
Demos promises to marry the values of liberty, equality and community with
those of individual initiative and responsibility.
'It (the think tank) is founded on the belief that we need a new and more
imaginative way of thinking about politics that draws on the best of the
democratic traditions without losing a hard headed rigour about what works
in the real world,' the blurb says.
Such goals might equally well be claimed by the Labour party and its allied
if independent think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research. But at
Westminster there is ill-disguised hostility from many Labour MPs - much
aimed personally at Mr Jacques for his recent withering critique of Mr John
Smith in the less-than-progressive Daily Mail.
Many of the 500 guests at tonight's launch party at the National Theatre can
be counted on to enjoy Demos's hospitality while also mocking its calls for
people to think in 'a more holistic fashion' or its view that 'the new can
trickle upwards and outwards, rather than raining downwards'.
But a think tank can only be judged on its thoughts, and lest anyone thinks
Demos lacks gravitas, the first paper it intends to publish will be on the
unflakey subject of tax and public expenditure.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems cool over Labour
Maastricht plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS of as many as six more government defeats on the Maastricht
bill appeared to be receding last night as senior Liberal Democrats
indicated they were unlikely to support a string of non-wrecking Labour
amendments.
But government whips were still left facing a stormy passage when the bill
returns for detailed Commons consideration tomorrow.
At least two further Labour amendments - including its attempt to remove the
protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out - were expected to
secure Liberal Democrat support, making government defeats likely.
Meanwhile, government hopes of speeding up the passage of the bill by
carrying procedural motions extending debate into the small hours were also
looking forlorn. By what are thought to be the Tory whips' own calculations,
the government could still be some 20 short of the votes necessary to do
this, even when the Liberal Democrats agree to side with them.
Two weeks ago, the government suffered its first Commons defeat on any issue
for about three years when MPs supported a minor Labour amendment to the
Maastricht bill by a margin of 22 votes. And it suffered a fresh humiliation
when the bill was last debated on March 12, deciding against calling a vote
to extend the sitting after 10pm, despite hinting heavily that it planned to
do so.
The non-wrecking Labour amendments - which mainly focus on increasing the
accountability to parliament of various European institutions and the Bank
of England - could conceivably secure enough support to be carried even
without the Lib Dems.
But not all the 50 Tory rebels who government whips expect to vote against
or abstain on procedural motions would be likely to rebel over these
amendments. Hard-core rebels are expected to meet today to discuss tactics.
The Liberal Democrats are not expected to decide on strategy until tomorrow.
The party is believed to be leaning towards the view that Labour's accent on
accountability risks distracting attention from the issue of how best to
make European institutions more democratic.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath adds to pressure over fuel
tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR EDWARD HEATH, the former Conservative prime minister, last night stepped
up the pressure on the government not to restrict help with increased costs
arising from the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel bills to
those receiving social security payments.
Speaking in the closing stages of the four-day Commons debate on the Budget
he stressed that those 'just above' the qualifying level for income support
would also be hard hit by the new impost.
Sir Edward called on the government to agree that the right course would be
to accept that all in this category should be 'fully' compensated.
While giving a general welcome to the Budget, Sir Edward urged the
chancellor not to persist in setting targets for cuts in direct taxation.
Earlier Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, denied a
weekend newspaper report that he had a 'furious row' with Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel bills.
When consulted on the issue he had made no protest because he shared the
chancellor's judgment that it was necessary to raise taxation in the Budget,
he told MPs.
Mr Heseltine stressed that he had not been prepared to 'cop out of the
difficult tax decisions' on the contemptible ground that, while ready to
agree in principle, he disagreed with a particular item.
In an effort to reassure Tory backbenchers uneasy about the extension of VAT
to domestic fuel bills he reaffirmed that there would be extra help for less
well-off pensioners and others on low incomes from next April before the
higher bills were received. Labour MPs heckled Mr Heseltine when he asserted
that this had already been made clear by Mr Lamont and by Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, insisted that the
assurances given by the government about compensation were inadequate.
He maintained that there were 1.3m pensioners entitled to income support but
who did not receive a penny either because of mistaken pride or for other
reasons, while another 1m were within 1 per cent of the qualifying level.
He urged Tory backbenchers who were not satisfied with the undertakings
given by the government to join with Labour MPs at the end of the debate in
voting against the extension of VAT to domestic fuel bills.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Inflation distortions under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES WILL be required to eliminate distortions in their accounts caused
by foreign currency transactions in high-inflation countries under draft
regulations from the Accounting Standards Board.
A proposed consensus from the board's urgent-issues task force recommends
that companies operating in hyper-inflationary economies should remove
distortions before incorporating the figures into consolidated accounts.
They may either adjust the local currency financial statements to reflect
current price levels or use a relatively stable currency to measure the
foreign operations.
The proposed regulations are out for consultation and are likely to be
approved after the next meeting of the task force on May 12. If so they
would become mandatory soon after.
In an information sheet circulated to preparers of accounts the task force
also said it was seeking legal advice on requiring companies to mark their
current investment assets to market.
The proposals would require companies to show at market value their highly
liquid and readily marketable investments held as current assets, in the way
already adopted by marketmakers and other investment dealers.
Insurance companies will be temporarily exempt from some of the requirements
of FRS 3, the new profit-and-loss accounting standard, under draft
guidelines issued by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday.
Following pressure from the insurance industry the board has said that the
sector will not have to calculate gains and losses on disposals of
investments by reference to the amount at which they are carried in the
balance sheet.
The proposals, contained in Fred 5, a financial reporting exposure draft,
are out for consultation until the end of April. They have been inspired by
new European Community legislation.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Analyst denies insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EDINBURGH investment analyst alleged to have passed on advance notice of
a company's forthcoming profits warning to share salesmen in his
stockbroking firm, and to have 'counselled and procured' them to deal in the
shares, went on trial at the Edinburgh Court of Session yesterday.
Mr Thorold Mackie of Bell Lawrie White, an offshoot of TSB Group, denies a
charge of obtaining and misusing price sensitive information under the 1985
Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
The indictment against him states that he was informed by Mr Peter Runciman,
who was then chairman of the waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan, of a
forthcoming profits warning in early September 1991.
It alleges that between September 6 and 12 he 'counselled and procured' Mr
Allan Gilmour Thom and Mr Colin McLeod Telfer of Bell Lawrie to deal in the
shares of Shanks &amp; McEwan. The two salesmen sold 1.9m shares on behalf of
clients of Bell Lawrie White at prices of between Pounds 3.04 and Pounds
3.18. They thus avoided the fall in the price of the shares from Pounds 2.70
to Pounds 2.28 which occurred after the profits warning was issued on
September 19. The indictment states that they realised Pounds 1.39m more
than they would have obtained had they sold the shares after the profits
warning.
Yesterday Mr Runciman, giving evidence for the prosecution, said that in
July 1991 he indicated to analysts that growth in Shanks &amp; McEwan's earnings
per share, previously 20 per cent a year, would fall to 15 per cent in the
year to March 31 1992.
In August the company's internal estimate was revised to 10 per cent, and
then in early September to a fall of 1.6 per cent, after a significant
contract did not materialise.
With the share price still rising because of brokers' forecasts, and
recognising that there had been a material change in the company's fortunes,
he decided to issue a profits warning.
'We realised it would come as a bombshell and would cause a general loss of
confidence in the company,' Mr Runciman said.
The case continues today.

FT  23 MAR 93 / BA holds back on fresh peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS has made no new approach to Virgin Atlantic to resolve their
'dirty tricks' dispute since the smaller airline broke off peace talks last
Friday.
Asked at a news conference in Birmingham yesterday whether BA would take
fresh steps to prevent a long legal battle between the two airlines, Sir
Colin Marshall, BA chairman, said: 'Not at the present time'.
Following the collapse of the talks Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman,
has threatened to take his case with new evidence to courts in the UK, the
US and the European Community.
Virgin officials said yesterday that they had heard nothing from BA. They
added that the airline's lawyers were considering the order in which they
would file legal action against BA.
Sir Colin, making his first public statement on the issue since the talks
collapsed, appeared to be keeping the door open for further talks.
'We've made it clear all along we're prepared to sit down and talk,' he
said.

FT  23 MAR 93 / BR doubts mandate for stoppage: Rail union calls one-day
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL said last night that the RMT transport union, the main rail
union, lacked a clear mandate from its members for a 24-hour strike on April
2 against threatened redundancies.
The union announced earlier in the day that its members had voted 26,097 to
10,314 in a 64 per cent turnout in favour of a 24-hour strike and further
industrial action.
BR said that fewer than 40 per cent of RMT members had voted to support
disruption. 'This result reflects the real reservations of railway staff
towards calls for industrial action,' it said.
'RMT must acknowledge that it does not have a mandate for anything, and pull
back from any action they may have contemplated.'
Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, promised that BR would try to find 'a way
through to avoid disruption'. He said: 'I am hopeful we will be able to
avoid the industrial action. Talks may be held today with RMT leaders to try
to resolve their differences.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT's general secretary, said
that the vote had been about jobs. He added: 'The message is clear - enough
is enough.'
The union fears that 20,000 jobs are at risk on the railways as a result of
privatisation in addition to the 7,000 redundancies already planned for this
year. RMT officials want BR to guarantee that there will be no compulsory
redundancies in the railway industry and that contract labour will not be
used as a replacement for existing workers.
The planned strike action on the railways on April 2 coincides with a
24-hour stoppage by members of the National Union of Mineworkers. Mr Knapp
would not rule out further one-day strikes if BR did not reassure the union
about redundancies.
The other rail unions, Aslef, the footplateman's union, and TSSA, the staff
union, are not involved in the disruption. RMT members include signalmen,
and the railway system cannot function if they refuse to work. If the
planned 24-hour strike goes ahead it will be the first stoppage by the RMT
since 1989.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Violent search for a settlement at Timex: The confrontation
which has followed the sacking of 320 workers in Dundee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIOLENT scenes yesterday outside the Timex circuit-board plant in Dundee
are indicative of the mounting anger among the 320 strikers who were
dismissed by the US-owned company last month, and who are determined to win
their jobs back.
But they also demonstrate how the workers' cause has been taken up by
far-left political groups such as Militant Tendency and the Socialist
Workers Party. Their presence is an embarrassment to the AEEU engineering
union, which represents the workers.
Mr John Kydd, senior shop steward at Timex, said: 'The company will either
have to take us all back or close the plant down for good.' Mr Jimmy Airlie,
the union's Scottish executive officer said: 'We cannot allow any company to
behave in the way that Timex has done and get away with it.'
Just over four weeks ago Timex sacked all the workers at the plant -
although those who had been in dispute for 21 days had agreed to go back to
work under protest.
What was even more surprising to some was Timex's decision to sack employees
who had worked through the original strike.
Mr Peter Hall, Timex's UK president, said this was necessary to prevent
legal action by individual workers over imposed changes in their employment
contracts. But the move did little to calm the labour force.
The ferocity of the strike has taken the normally conciliatory union by
surprise. Union officials emphasise their moderate tradition by pointing out
that it was the AEEU which wanted a single-union deal with Ford when the
company considered building a plant in Dundee five years ago.
Union officials said that from the start they had tried to negotiate a
compromise but Timex had shown no interest.
The Timex president said: 'The dispute is over as far as the company is
concerned.'
Timex has sought to use the courts to end the dispute. Initially it secured
an interdict - equivalent to an injunction - to limit the number of pickets
outside its gates to six.
But the company's subsequent attempts to tighten the legal restrictions on
the strikers have proved less successful. It failed to prevent the 320
former employees from taking part in picketing, and last week the Court of
Session in Edinburgh rejected a submission that the union was causing a
disturbance by holding marches and demonstrations outside the plant.
Some of the strike leaders still face an attempt by the company to have them
jailed for alleged breaches of the original interdict. The union says it has
withdrawn its legal representation of the leaders for fear of opening its
funds to civil damages.
With unemployment in Dundee above 10 per cent, the company says it is not
encountering difficulties in hiring a new workforce.
It insists that its competitive position required drastic action and says
falling demand meant it needed to cut costs and reduce production.
Timex negotiated with the union for two months. Senior executives from its
Connecticut headquarters flew to Britain in mid-February to seek a deal.
The workforce was asked to accept a 12-month pay freeze, a 10 per cent cut
in benefits including pension rights and a lay-off rota for six months with
access to independent arbitration in case of problems.
Timex told the union that it intended to extend production in the second
half of the year and recruit a further 300 workers. But when the workers
refused to accept the package, the company lost patience.
The violent scenes yesterday outside the Dundee plant are certainly not
wanted by the AEEU, which would like nothing better than a quick and
amicable end to what it sees as an unnecessary conflict. Its wish does not
seem likely to be granted.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Doubts over costs of council reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, said yesterday the savings that could be
made by reforming the structure of local government in Scotland may have
been miscalculated.
It is understood that some estimates of possible savings, made by Touche
Ross for the Scottish Office and published in a green paper in October, may
be too high, and some estimates of the cost of transition may be too low.
The green paper proposed a move from the existing nine regional councils, 53
district councils and three unitary island councils to a single-tier
structure.

A DRAFT bill to reform the Sunday trading laws will be published within the
next few months along with a paper about the impact of its provisions, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said yesterday.
It would be made available 'well before' the summer recess, which begins in
July, Mr Clarke said.
There is no room for the bill in the present legislative session and it
cannot begin its passage through parliament until autumn at the earliest.
The government is keen, however, to let MPs know the progress that is being
made in consulting pressure groups about possible models for reform, in
order to maintain the momentum of its proposals.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Volvo bus plant opens in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, yesterday started
production at its Pounds 6.5m bus chassis assembly plant at Irvine,
Ayrshire, Kevin Done writes.
The operation, which runs alongside Volvo's existing truck assembly plant at
Irvine, has a capacity to build 1,500 bus chassis a year.
The start of production marks the completion of Volvo's rationalisation of
its bus operations in the UK. These have been drastically reduced since
Volvo's Pounds 24m takeover of Leyland Bus in 1988.
Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the UK bus operations had
cost Volvo nearly Pounds 100m - which includes the acquisition price and
five years of losses. As part of the restructuring, Volvo has transferred
all bus chassis assembly to Irvine from the former Leyland Bus plant at
Workington, Cumbria. This will close by the end of June with the loss of
more than 100 jobs.
Volvo ended all production of bus bodies in the UK last year. With the
transfer of chassis production to Irvine it is giving up the Leyland Bus
brand name.
Volvo said the transfer of production had created 70 new jobs in the Irvine
bus assembly operations with the prospect of a further 80 'as markets
recover, demand increases and plant output moves towards its 1,500 units a
year capacity'.
Volvo assembled 2,309 trucks at Irvine last year with a workforce of 300. On
the new bus line it is planning to build chassis for the Olympian
double-deck bus and the B6 single-deck midi bus. Output of the heavy-duty
B10M single-deck bus/coach chassis is planned to start in 1994.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Tanker routes to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH shipowners yesterday launched a voluntary code for routeing oil
tankers away from the most environmentally-sensitive areas around the shores
of the UK.
The Chamber of Shipping proposed that oil-laden tankers keep away from 12 of
the most sensitive areas in the wake of the Braer tanker disaster off the
Shetland Islands.
A task force was set up by the chamber following the incident in January,
when the tanker ran aground and spilled 84,000 tonnes of oil.
Mr Les Atkinson, chairman of BP Shipping who headed the task force, said:
'The code essentially deals with major aspects of poor quality of operation.
'Compliance with this is not going to solve all incidents of tanker
pollution, by any manner of means, but it should help a great deal.'
The task force looked at 15 environmentally-sensitive areas around the coast
where existing routeing procedures did not offer specific advice for
tankers.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Howard asks for toxic cargo ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, has asked his German counterpart,
Mr Klaus Topfer, to prevent a shipment of German hazardous waste being
imported into the UK.
The cargo, believed to involve 1,000 tonnes of waste, is due to be shipped
from a Hamburg plant owned by Boehringer-Ingelheim, the German group, to a
high-temperature incinerator in Pontypool.
Under existing legislation the UK is not able to prevent the waste entering
the country. In May next year the international export of toxic waste from
developed countries is due to be stopped.
Mr Topfer has said he will look into the matter. Earlier this year he agreed
to re-import about 420 tonnes of German toxic waste from Romania. The
material, which included chemicals, pesticides, paints and varnishes, was
illegally exported to Romania from both east and west Germany.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday tabled a series of
parliamentary questions on the trade in toxic waste and about the latest
consignment in particular.
Mr Smith said that in December last year Mr David Maclean, the environment
minister, said the government intended to end the import of toxic waste into
the UK from developed countries.
'Even if ministers have no legal power at the moment to prohibit the
importation of this particular consignment, they should be flexing every
political muscle they have to stop it coming in,' he added.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Private cash urged for council homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-SECTOR capital could be used to modernise local-authority housing
stock if councils transferred ownership of their estates to arms-length
housing companies, says a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, the social research organisation.
The report says that transferring council estates to local housing companies
would allow funds to be raised on the capital markets without increasing the
public sector borrowing requirement. The move could produce savings in
public expenditure of Pounds 16bn for the Treasury, releasing funds for
building affordable rented accommodation.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, welcomed the report and promised the
environment department would examine it 'with great care'. He warned,
however, that any new approach would have to be attractive to tenants and
investors, as well as local authorities and the government. The Rowntree
report investigates ways in which local authorities could borrow against the
security of their housing stock to modernise and repair council homes.
At present such borrowing counts towards the public sector borrowing
requirement and is therefore controlled by the Treasury.
Nineteen councils have arranged to transfer their estates to housing
associations which can borrow outside the PSBR. Many, however - especially
in inner cities - cannot do this because the current value of their housing
stock is less than the debt outstanding on it.
Councils would retain a non-controlling interest, with tenants'
representatives on the boards.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Trade deficit with non-EC countries widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S TRADE deficit with countries outside the European Community
widened sharply last month, raising fears about structural problems in the
economy as it emerges from the recession.
The visible trade deficit deteriorated by Pounds 274m in February to Pounds
1.3bn, the second-biggest monthly deficit on record. The value of imports
and exports reached record highs.
The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed
that import prices rose 2.25 per cent in February against a 0.5 per cent
rise in export prices.
The most widely used measure of underlying trends showed that while import
and export volumes reached record highs, imports continued to grow faster
than exports on a three-monthly basis.
The trade deficit was expected to rise for a while after devaluation because
of the higher cost of imports. But yesterday's figures showed that import
volumes excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones
have also risen. They rose 6 per cent in the past three months compared with
the three months to November. Exports rose 4.5 per cent in the same period.
Although the fall in the pound has made foreign goods more expensive the
trend continued last month. Underlying import volumes rose 3.2 per cent from
the previous month compared with a 1 per cent increase in underlying
exports.
The higher import volumes may reflect a rise in economic activity as
manufacturers increase orders for foreign components and raw materials.
The poor performance of non-EC trade comes in spite of the improving
economic outlook in north America. The value of exports to the US and Canada
rose 8.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months
to November, but imports in the same period rose 22 per cent. The balance of
trade with north America was nonetheless healthier than a year ago.
The deficit with Western Europe excluding the EC also widened. Import values
rose 13 per cent in the latest three months compared with export growth of 5
per cent.
Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'Strengthening
economic recovery in North America compares with dismal recessionary forces
in the major EC economies. We might have expected the UK's trade performance
with countries outside the EC to have reflected this.'
The figures show that export growth has been concentrated in basic materials
in recent months, although the CSO pointed out that this mainly reflected a
large consignment of industrial diamonds that left the country in February.
Export volumes of manufactured goods rose 3 per cent in the three months to
the end of February compared with the previous three months.
The deficit in oil narrowed to Pounds 110m in February compared with Pounds
135m in January.
The erratics deficit deteriorated to Pounds 320m from Pounds 128m and as a
result the underlying visible trade deficit, which excludes both oil and
erratics, also widened to Pounds 904m from Pounds 797m in January.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Banks seek early move on settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS SAID yesterday they would press for a rapid switch to the rolling
settlement of share accounts within 10 days of trades after the collapse of
the Stock Exchange's Taurus project for automated settlement.
The British Bankers' Association said a decision to move to rolling
settlement should be made before the Bank of England's task force on a
Taurus replacement produces its full report at the end of June.
Mr Brian Pitman, the association's vice-president, said a move to settlement
within 10 days would benefit institutional investors and reduce the level of
risk in the banking system created by the settling of accounts on set days.
Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said banks were 'not
comfortable with the bunching of risk and paper-shuffling that goes with
account days'. He said banks and institutional investors would like a rapid
move to rolling settlement.
Although the Bank of England's task force is not due to report until June,
Lord Inchyra said banks wanted an earlier decision to move to rolling
settlement even if it was implemented only after a reasonable period of
notice.
The Stock Exchange said a decision on rolling settlement would have to be
made by the Bank of England task force.
It said it could not predict whether there would be any technical
difficulties.
The banks also said that a final decision on whether to alter the custom of
banks answering inquiries about customers' accounts from other banks without
seeking express consent would be made within 'a few months'.
The association's officials have proposed a move to a new system under which
banks would respond only to 'status inquiries' directly to third parties
with the written consent of the customers involved.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Ministers 'missed chance' on NHS pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERIC CAINES, the personnel director of the National Health Service, said
yesterday government ministers and managers of new National Health Service
trusts had failed to grasp a unique opportunity to abolish central pay
mechanisms and improve performance in the service.
Mr Caines, who leaves the NHS next week, took a keen interest in the
abolition of central mechanisms for pay and terms of employment and the
introduction of local trust-based bargaining.
Only a handful of NHS trusts have moved in this direction and the government
has not abolished central machinery, including pay review bodies and the
Whitley council.
Trusts give several reasons for staying within their remit, including the
need to concentrate on more immediate practical problems.
Mr Caines, in a final salvo against NHS managers and ministers, said in an
interview in Personnel Today that one of the most important areas needing
attention when the first NHS trusts were set up was to devise trust-based
reward systems balancing fair pay and the need for flexibility in work
practices.
He said: 'Unfortunately - and it grieves me to say this - the NHS has almost
certainly passed up the best, indeed the only opportunity it has ever had to
make fundamental changes in these areas.'
Managers, he said, had failed to see the billions of pounds spent on pay as
a key management tool.
Unions representing hospital workers said yesterday they had rejected
suggestions by two trusts, Hillingdon in Middlesex and Redbridge in Essex,
to forego the 1.5 per cent pay increase this year.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Setbacks to spending curb on legal aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S proposals for curbing the rise in legal-aid spending
suffered two setbacks yesterday.
The Law Society won leave in the High Court to challenge the proposal of
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to replace hourly-based fees with standard
fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts.
The Commons home affairs committee said the Lord Chancellor's plans to cut
legal aid eligibility would deprive people access to justice. The MPs called
for a full day's debate in the Commons on Lord Mackay's proposals.
The High Court was told that Lord Mackay's decision to introduce standard
fees went against the principle in the 1988 Legal Aid Act that a solicitor
would receive 'fair remuneration' for a case.
Mr Michael Beloff, QC for the society, said Lord Mackay's 'desire for
economy' had overridden the need to act both lawfully and rationally.
The regulations relating to standard fees are due for implementation on June
1. Granting the society leave for an urgent hearing, Mr Justice Macpherson
said: 'I firmly believe there is a case which should be argued. It is most
unfortunate that there should be litigation between the largest of the two
branches of the law and the head of the judiciary.'
The Commons home affairs committee report said the proposed cuts in legal
aid eligibility, designed to save Pounds 43m in the legal aid budget in
1993-94, Pounds 110m in 1994-95 and Pounds 175m in 1995-96, should have been
preceded by a cost-benefit analysis of their effect across the range of
public spending.
MPs say it is important to determine why legal-aid costs are rising so
rapidly. This must be complemented by an inquiry into the scope for savings
and efficiency gains in the way legal services are delivered and courts run.
They call for a government commitment to restore the eligibility cuts in
real terms once other savings are found.
They also recommend that the plan to abolish free legal advice under the
green form scheme for those with a disposable income of more than Pounds 61
a week should be changed to allow those with disposable income just above
that figure to continue to receive advice with a contribution.
The government has already taken a decision to retain the contributory green
form scheme in Scotland and MPs say they see no justification for treating
people in England and Wales differently.

FT  23 MAR 93 / George Walker switches tack in bankruptcy fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE WALKER, the former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker,
the property and leisure group, is back fighting moves by his creditors to
have him declared bankrupt.
Only two weeks ago Mr Walker, who faces claims from his creditors for up to
Pounds 180m, made his own application to be made bankrupt. The move was to
enable him to qualify for legal aid in his defence against theft charges
involving Pounds 12.5m brought by the Serious Fraud Office.
Having overcome the problem which prevented him getting legal aid for his
trial, he yesterday dropped his bankruptcy application - but found himself
facing a fresh petition from his creditors.
The creditors say Mr Walker has breached the individual voluntary
arrangement (IVA) he reached with them last September to repay his debt
without being declared bankrupt. The IVA had been agreed after a narrow vote
in the face of opposition from the banks, who continued to argue for Mr
Walker's bankruptcy.
At a High Court hearing yesterday the supervisors of the IVA said the
agreement had been breached because Mr Walker's wife, Jean, was not now
intending to pay for civil litigation against Brent Walker. These actions
might have increased the amount of money available to be repaid to
creditors.
Lawyers for the supervisors claimed that Mr Walker's solicitor had told them
that Mrs Walker now intended to spend her money supporting her husband's
defence for his criminal trial. Mr Walker's solicitor, Mr Michael Coleman,
denies such a conversation took place.
The bankruptcy petition was supported by two of Mr Walker's largest
creditors - a group of banks led by the TSB, and the Inland Revenue, to whom
Mr Walker owes Pounds 40m.
Mr Martin Pascoe, for the banks, said Mr Walker was now seeking to escape
from the conditions imposed by the IVA. Mr Robin Hollington, for Mr Walker,
opposed the bankruptcy petition, saying it was a 'draconian' measure. The
hearing was adjourned until April 2.
Mr Walker had originally been refused legal aid for his trial because the
Legal Aid Board ruled that his assets, although pledged to creditors through
the IVA, were still technically his. A magistrate overruled this decision
last week.
If the bankruptcy order against Mr Walker was granted, he would become
Britain's second-biggest bankrupt after Mr Kevin Maxwell, against whom
claims exceeding Pounds 400m have been made.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Companies 'fail to meet' EC health laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of UK companies are not complying with six health-and-safety
laws which came into effect on January 1, personnel directors have admitted
in a survey.
The laws - dubbed the six-pack - include new rules on using visual display
units, lifting heavy loads and providing safety equipment.
The laws result from the UK's implementation of European Community
directives.
A survey of 500 personnel directors and managers carried out by Personnel
Today magazine found that 54 per cent of companies in the survey did not
meet the new rules.
A quarter of the total sample had taken no action, while 14 per cent had
amended existing policies. A further 13 per cent had carried out assessments
of potential dangers as required by the laws.
Just 6 per cent of companies in the survey had studied the regulations and 1
per cent of those surveyed had allocated funds to bring them into line with
the new laws.
Employers yesterday defended their lack of compliance. Mr John Cridland, the
Confederation of British Industry's director of environmental affairs, said:
'Expecting the world to change on January 1 is naive in the extreme,
especially in the midst of recession.'
The CBI said that risk assessment was the key to the new regulations. 'The
greater the risk, the more the need for action and the greater the
response,' said Mr Cridland.
He added that government and business had a responsible approach to the six
new laws.
The GMB general union accused the Health and Safety Executive of failing to
alert employers about the laws. Mr Nigel Bryson, the union's director of
health and environment, said: 'Where are the TV programmes? Where are the
posters from HSE telling employers about the need to carry out risk
assess-ments?'
The executive had already said the new rules would not be enforced
immediately unless the 'risks to health and safety are evident and immediate
. . . or employers appear deliberately obdurate and unwilling to recognise
their responsibilities'.
It said Pounds 350,000 had been spent on press advertisements. 'We feel we
spent the money judiciously and in a way which would achieve value for
money,' the executive said.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Poor basic skills 'cost Pounds 5bn a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR BASIC skills, including problems with reading and writing, are costing
industry nearly Pounds 5bn a year, a survey of companies published today by
the government-funded Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit shows.
One in seven companies interviewed felt the impact of poor basic skills on
its organisation was severe or very severe. Eighty-five per cent felt that
poor basic skills contributed to reduced efficiencies, a poor image with
customers and to increased costs.
Thirteen per cent of adults over 16 years of age in the companies
interviewed had serious reading, writing, mathematical and verbal
difficulties.
Estimates on the total cost to British industry included the cost of staff
who could be dispensed with if basic skills were better and the cost of
rectifying customer orders dispatched incorrectly.
Gallup interviewed more than 400 companies.
The Scottish education system, although widely recognised as good, is
failing too many children by not teaching them basic skills, Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
Many young Scots were leaving school unable to read or write, or add up, he
said in a speech to Conservatives in Aberdeen.
'They don't even have the tools to do the jobs of yesterday, never mind
tomorrow,' he said.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Bailiffs use buses in car dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAILIFFS will take buses instead of their own cars tomorrow to carry out
their duties. The change will be part of a programme of industrial action.
About 600 county-court bailiffs in England and Wales who are members of the
Civil and Public Services Association are protesting about the compensation
they receive for using their own cars in working hours.
The bailiffs will use public transport to carry out orders of the court
tomorrow and on Thursday. They also intend to withdraw good will and start
an indefinite work to rule.
The union said it was the first time bailiffs had taken industrial action
over an issue directly affecting their terms and conditions.
'The action will slow down the enforcement work carried out by bailiffs,' it
added.
It said its bailiff members should 'not be expected to subsidise the Lord
Chancellor when carrying out their authorised duties'.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Consumer optimism rising, says poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE ABOUT the general economic situation has risen slightly this
month, but pessimists continue to outweigh optimists, the latest Gallup
survey of consumer confidence showed yesterday, Emma Tucker writes.
The survey, conducted in the first two weeks of the month, found that 40 per
cent of the 2,025 adults sampled believed the economic situation would
worsen over the next 12 months against 27 per cent who believed it would
improve. The difference between the two figures was one of the lowest since
July last year.
Twenty-six per cent expected their household's financial position to worsen
this year while 20 per cent expected it to improve.
The results of the survey point to a fragile improvement in consumer
confidence, but it is too early to judge the impact of the Budget on
sentiment.
Fear of unemployment continues to damp optimism, however, with 76 per cent
of the survey's respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the 12 months
ahead.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Doubts over costs of Scottish reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, yesterday said the savings that could be
made by reforming the structure of local government in Scotland may have
been miscalculated, James Buxton writes.
It is understood that some estimates of possible savings, made by Touche
Ross for the Scottish Office and published in a green paper in October, may
be too high, and some estimates of the cost of transition may be too low.
The green paper proposed a move from the existing nine regional councils, 53
district councils and three unitary island councils to a single-tier
structure.
Touche Ross said savings would range from Pounds 192m a year for a
15-council structure to Pounds 55m for 35 councils, while a 51-council
structure would cost Pounds 58m more. Transition costs ranged from Pounds
215m for 15 councils to Pounds 159m for 51 councils.
But Strathclyde regional council pointed to flaws and omissions in the basis
of the calculations and in an interview in The Scotsman Mr Lang said: 'It
may well be that some of the assumptions made by Touche Ross will be less
relevant when the final decisions are taken. For example assumptions about
numbers of staff that would be needed are open to question.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Scots schools 'fail in basic skills'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTTISH education system, although widely recognised as good, is
failing too many children by not teaching them basic skills, Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
Large numbers of young Scots were leaving school unable to read or write, or
add up, he said in a speech to Conservatives in Aberdeen.
'They don't even have the tools to do the jobs of yesterday, never mind
tomorrow.'
He said calls for a period of calm to digest recent changes were
understandable but they could not be allowed to stand in the way of the need
for change to achieve higher standards.
Teaching had to return to the backbones of education of the past -
'spelling, punctuation, grammar, arithmetic'.
Assessment by regular testing was essential, in spite of the 'overblown
rhetoric' of its critics, he said.
Mr Lang said the policy outlined last year and broadly accepted by the
teaching profession, provided for pupils aged between five and 14 to be
tested five times in reading, writing and mathematics when the teacher
judged them to be ready to 'negotiate the test successfully'.
He highlighted the problem of truancy and said that each school's truancy
performance would be recorded for 1993-94 and included in the school's
handbook from the following year.
He reminded education authorities that they had the power to prosecute
parents who did not ensure that their children went to school.
Mr Lang said that school boards - the equivalent of boards of governors in
England - which were introduced in the late 1980s by Mr Michael Forsyth,
then Scottish education minister, were 'frankly, of varying quality'.
Many still lacked self-confidence or were less interested than they might
be.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Volvo bus plant opens in Ayrshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, THE Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, yesterday started
production at its Pounds 6.5m bus chassis assembly plant at Irvine,
Ayrshire.
The operation, which runs alongside Volvo's existing truck assembly plant at
Irvine, has a capacity to build 1,500 bus chassis a year.
The start of production marks the completion of Volvo's rationalisation of
its bus operations in the UK. These have been drastically reduced since
Volvo's Pounds 24m takeover of Leyland Bus in 1988.
Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the UK bus operations had
cost Volvo nearly Pounds 100m - which includes the acquisition price and
five years of losses.
As part of the restructuring, Volvo has transferred all bus chassis assembly
to Irvine from the former Leyland Bus plant at Workington, Cumbria, This
will close by the end of June with the loss of more than 100 jobs.
Volvo had previously closed bus production at the Farington, Lancashire bus
plant. Mr Larsson said that the 'depressed' state of the UK market meant it
had been 'absolutely essential' to close the Workington plant to reduce the
company's break-even point.
Leyland Bus, which once dominated the UK industry and employed 5,000 people
in the early 1980s, had a workforce of 1,850, when it was taken over by
Volvo five years ago.
All that remains is a components operation, Farington Components, near
Leyland in Lancashire, which is still a subsidiary of Volvo Trucks (Great
Britain), and has a workforce of 360. Volvo ended all production of bus
bodies in the UK last year. With the transfer of chassis production to
Irvine it is giving up the Leyland Bus brand name.
Volvo said the transfer of production had created 70 new jobs in the Irvine
bus assembly operations with the prospect of a further 80 'as markets
recover, demand increases and plant output moves towards its 1,500 units a
year capacity'.
Volvo assembled 2,309 trucks at Irvine last year with a workforce of 300. On
the new bus line it is planning to build chassis for the Olympian
double-deck bus and the B6 single-deck midi bus. Output of the heavy-duty
B10M single-deck bus/coach chassis is planned to start in 1994. Irvine will
be the sole assembly centre in the Volvo group worldwide for the Olympian
and B6 bus chassis.
The introduction of the B6 midi bus marks Volvo's entry into this segment of
the bus market, which has grown rapidly in significance in the UK as bus
operators have moved to smaller buses under the impact of recession and the
deregulation and privatisation of passenger transport.
Volvo's Workington bus production fell last year to 458 from 593 a year
earlier. Mr Larsson, said the Irvine plant had an order book for 325
Olympian double-deck buses, including a contract for 50 received last week
from Hong Kong. Production of nearly 300 midi buses was planned for this
year, he added.
Volvo Bus worldwide recorded an operating profit last year of SKr89m (Pounds
7.8m) after a 1991 operating loss of SKr152m, said Mr Larsson.
Volvo deliveries of bus chassis worldwide jumped by 20 per cent last year to
5,582 from 4,650 in 1991, with more than 60 per cent going to markets
outside Europe. Its five key markets last year were Brazil, the UK, Iran,
Uruguay and Sweden.

FEWER THAN one in three organisations sets targets for employment of people
from ethnic minority groups, a survey by the independent research group,
Industrial Relations Services, shows.
The group said although both the government and the Commission for Racial
Equality had endorsed the use of numerical targets to act solely as
employment benchmarks, employers who set targets feared they would be seen
as operating quotas - numbers from ethnic minorities that must be employed
by a set date.
The study of 166 organisations, covering more than 2m workers, found that
just over three quarters of respondents had carried out a workforce audit to
determine the ethnic origin of their employees.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Shuttle's German mission set back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE launch of a US space shuttle on a Spacelab science mission chartered and
paid for by Germany was aborted by ground computers three seconds before
take-off yesterday.
Two of the three main engines had ignited fully and white smoke and vapour
engulfed the pad as usual when power was shut down. It was only the third
engine shutdown in 12 years of shuttle flying.
Nasa officials said a valve in the third engine had apparently failed to
close, causing pressure to build up in a line that drains moisture and other
waste from the engine.
Mr Jurgen Beck, a board member of the German space agency, said the aborted
launch was 'extremely irritating'. Germany is hoping to play a significant
role in European operations aboard a future US space station.
The German agency is spending Dollars 560m (Pounds 394m) on the mission and
is under political pressure to get it off the ground. The seven-strong crew
included two German physicists.
Researchers had been waiting five years for this Spacelab mission, the
second to be sponsored by Germany.
It has been dogged by problems, however, having been first planned in
September 1988, but postponed because of the Challenger disaster two years
earlier. It had been supposed to lift off on February 25, but has been
postponed several times for technical reasons.
The launch director, Mr Bob Sieck, said it would take three weeks to remove
Columbia's engine valves for analysis and carry out other inspections.
Officials said it was too soon to say how the delay would affect this year's
shuttle flight schedule or whether Discovery's atmospheric research mission
planned for early April would go ahead as planned.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, the new German research minister, said last week that
the mission would be the last example of Germany's national participation in
the 'prestige' area of manned space travel.
In future, the space programme should be based on wider and cheaper
international co-operation.

<TEXT>
JAMAICA'S political leaders have signed a code of conduct in an attempt to
reduce party political violence in the last week of campaigning for next
Tuesday's general election.
The code, which constrains politicians from statements and action which
could inflame political passions, follows clashes between party factions and
which the police say have caused six deaths and several injuries.
A similar code of conduct, signed before the last election four years ago,
is credited with having reduced political tensions and violence. Police say
17 people were killed in incidents associated with party politics in the
1989 election. In 1980 about 600 of the 800 deaths in Jamaica that year were
attributed to party political violence in the poll campaign.
Public opinion polls published at the weekend have given Mr P J Patterson's
incumbent People's National party a four-point lead over the Jamaica Labour
party of Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister.

Russian and US nuclear submarines collided in Arctic waters this weekend but

either craft, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Russian naval commanders accused the rival boat of carrying out dangerous

the incident.
'The high command of the Russian military fleet expresses its extreme
concern over the latest incident of dangerous manoeuvring by foreign
submarines in military training zones,' a Russian navy statement said. A
spokesman said the Russian craft suffered minimal damage and there was no
radiation leak.

Chile's gross domestic product grew a provisional 10.4 per cent last year,
the highest growth rate of the past 27 years, the Central Bank said in a
report, Reuter reports from Santiago. In 1991 Chile achieved GDP growth of 6
per cent.
The 1992 figure exceeded forecasts by the Central Bank which put growth at
just below 10 per cent. The bank has forecast 1993 GDP growth of between 5
per cent and 6 per cent.
All sectors of the economy grew in 1992, but commerce grew fastest, showing
growth of 14.3 per cent, mainly because of higher imports, followed by
transport and communications, with 14.2 per cent.
The Central Bank said imports grew 22.2 per cent in 1992, while exports grew
12.3 per cent.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Mexico City calls for a mayor
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE majority of voters support moves towards greater democracy,
according to a plebiscite carried out in Mexico City.
In an attempt to put pressure on the Mexican government to accept an elected
mayor of Mexico City, more than 300,000 city residents voted on Sunday in a
plebiscite on the capital's political future.
Preliminary figures showed that among the 10 per cent of those eligible who
voted, 85 per cent favour the election of a mayor of Mexico City, 84 per
cent supported a local Congress with legislative power, and 66 per cent
approved of turning Mexico City into the country's 32nd state.
The poll was organised by a disparate group of democratic activists from all
the main political parties and civic organisations. It was intended to
highlight discontent with the lack of democracy in Mexico's business,
cultural and political capital - and indirectly in all Mexico. Those in
favour of plebiscite hoped to counter an argument, supported by many in the
Mexican government, that there was limited public interest in democratic
reform.
The organisational success of the plebiscite, and the overwhelming support
for the propositions, lends some credence to the argument of the democratic
activists. However, a turnout of 10 per cent was lower than the organisers
had hoped for.
For the most part the initiative had been frowned upon by Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party, and received only lukewarm support from
the current, unelected mayor, Mr Manuel Camacho.
The Mayor of Mexico City is now picked by the president, while the local
assembly has no power to write legislation.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Cuts draw blood on US campuses: Cash-strapped universities
are wielding the axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YALE UNIVERSITY, for 292 years a breeding ground of America's ruling elite,
has seen better days.
Entire academic disciplines are on the cutting block. Many faculty positions
and sports teams are already gone. Even Commons, the Greek revival hall
where undergraduates have taken meals throughout this century, has been
closed for dinner.
An Dollars 18.5m budget shortfall, the second in as many years, has forced
the country's third-oldest establishment of higher education down this path
of contraction. And Yale is not alone.
It is a debt struggle that is going on everywhere, says Acting President
Howard Lamar, an avuncular historian brought in to calm waters when the
previous president, Mr Benno Schmidt Jr, resigned after trying
unsuccessfully to make drastic cuts last year.
Mr Lamar, who has tapped Professor William Nordhaus, the Keynesian
economist, to help put the fiscal house in order, quickly adds that Yale,
with a Dollars 2.6bn endowment, is 'far less desperate' than other
universities.
New York's Columbia University, another bastion of the east coast Ivy
League, plans a Dollars 30m deficit over the next two years on its annual
Dollars 1bn budget. In California, Stanford University has begun efforts to
eradicate a Dollars 125m deficit over the next three years. Less well known
schools like the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut have even
threatened bankruptcy.
The reasons are clear. Rising faculty salaries and health care costs which
have grown by 360 per cent in the past eight years, have strained budgets.
Potentially lucrative research in fields such as particle physics and
molecular biology is capital intensive and the federal government, with its
own budget pressures, does not want to continue footing most of the bill.
State schools face additional pressure from fidgety legislatures. For the
first time in 33 years, state support for higher education went down last
year.
In California, the state legislature, struggling with a Dollars 10.7bn
deficit, cut the education budget by Dollars 2.2bn, roughly 12 per cent. The
allocation to nine-campus University of California system, which includes
Berkeley, was cut by 11 per cent. The university, once a model for other
state systems, has frozen pay, cut 5,000 jobs and doubled student fees over
the past two years. A proposal to reduce salaries by 5 per cent across the
board is on the table.
'A great university is a fairly fragile body,' laments Mr William Baker,
University of California vice-president for finance and administration. 'It
can be destroyed in a short time, but it takes years and years to build up
excellence.'
The universities, meanwhile, are getting less sympathy than they used to.
This reflects a popular sense, frequently evident in local newspapers, that
academia has become bloated, combined with a number of embarrassing
disclosures that some universities, notably Stanford, have misused federal
funds.
Officials at Stanford and other universities say the government has
harnessed an anti-intellectual populist sentiment to shrink support for the
sciences. But Mr Erich Bloch, who ran the National Science Foundation in
1984-91, points out that after 30 years of steady growth the government must
level support.
Tuition has also done little to endear universities to the middle-classes,
too rich to qualify for financial aid but too poor to afford large term
bills. Just last week, Yale became the first US university to break the
Dollars 25,000 a year fee threshold. The 5.9 per cent increase was the
school's lowest in 20 years but still far outpaced inflation.
More troubling is the sense that the money is wasted. American faculties,
faculty members, notorious for spending little time in the class, have
developed a taste for lucrative research or writing books. After all, those
are the criteria for achieving academic tenure.
Congress, which called academics to account on science funding, has
responded to the public unease. Ms Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat,
last autumn held a well publicised select hearing under the loaded title,
'College Education: Paying More and Getting Less'.
Academics feel a bit indignant. A lot of good research, particularly in the
emerging biotechnology field, is done at universities. The misuse of funds
at most universities was scant in relation to the volume of research, it is
frequently argued. 'It's plain to everybody that it was blown out of
proportion,' says Professor Donald Kennedy, former Stanford president.
What is not clear is whether the squeeze is a cyclical readjustment or a
permanent shift. Faculties were reduced in the 1970s. And the bureaucratic
cuts are probably long overdue.
But, this time, universities have been forced to rethink their long-term
priorities and, quite without precedent, to pick and choose their strengths.
This idea of 'selective excellence' - often associated with Mr Robert
Zemsky, who runs the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the
University of Pennsylvania - works on the assumption that schools got too
big for their own good during 1980s.
Yale followed this creed last year by trying to trim the applied sciences,
such as engineering, sociology, applied physics and operations research,
along with 10.7 per cent of the faculty. The faculty rebuffed the measure,
and along with it the president, provost and dean. But some departments may
still go.
In any case, universities seem ready for a fresh start after a tumultuous
year. Duke, Columbia and the University of Chicago have named new
presidents. Mr Gerhard Casper, the German-born scholar who took over at
Stanford last autumn, has worked quietly to restore the university's
tarnished reputation.
Yale has yet to name a chief executive. Not surprisingly, the leading
candidates are good administrators - often with a background in economics.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines has cancelled a contract with Airbus Industrie for up
to 46 aircraft originally valued at about Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.95bn) as
the fifth largest US carrier attempts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
The contract included 20 firm orders for aircraft and options on 26 more.
Mr David Venz, an Airbus spokesman said: 'I believe this is a pro forma
technique to help Continental come out of bankruptcy. In some cases it is
automatic for contracts to be cancelled when companies come out of Chapter
11. I think the operative word here is 'reorganisation', Chapter 11 allows
the company to get itself reorganised, to come out and renegotiate
contracts. . . '
Mr Richard Danforth, a Continental spokesman, said: 'Through the bankruptcy
process we rejected the contract with Airbus. It is important to stress that
we continue to have discussions with all three aircraft manufacturers.'
Virgin Atlantic and its advertising agency have asked Continental to stop a
campaign claiming Continental's new BusinessFirst service is unique. Virgin
says its own Upper Class service is similar or superior to Continental's
BusinessFirst, and has been offered for nine years.

FT  23 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Mexico ponders price it must pay for Nafta
 -Side accords demanded by the US raise some thorny issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Carlos Salinas is asked about the side agreements on labour,
the environment and import surges which it is proposed to attach to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, he has a stock answer. They must not,
he says, be in conflict with the text of the basic accord; violate the
sovereignty of the negotiating countries; nor be protectionist.
Unfortunately for Mr Salinas (and Canada, which shares most Mexican
concerns), many of the proposals raised by the Clinton administration and,
above all, by US congressmen look to break all three conditions.
The side agreement on import surges would have to conflict with Nafta as the
latter already contains safeguards for industries affected by such surges.
The proposal to impose trade sanctions on companies that fail to comply with
environment and labour laws could expose thousands of Mexican companies to
endless complaints, and turn Nafta into a protectionist's charter.
The US proposal for trilateral commissions on labour and the environment
would, if they had any power, reek of interventionism.
However, given the Mexican government's desire to have Nafta passed as
quickly as possible by all three legislatures, it is sure to make
significant concessions. The question is which conditions are flexible, and
which are matters of principle.
The government has already accepted, albeit reluctantly, the principle of
negotiations on import surges. Indeed, the real aim of insisting side
agreements be consistent with the Nafta text was probably to avoid the US
administration opening up specific sectoral agreements - such as on sugar or
glass, or other areas where US businesses feel hard done by. Such a
reopening of Nafta would have delayed ratification, and could have caused
the whole treaty to unravel.
The question of sovereignty is the most tricky, for non-intervention in
other countries' affairs has been the cardinal principal of Mexican foreign
policy for 50 years, and a form of intellectual self-defence against US
interference.
But it is undeniable that Mexico has already sacrificed considerable
sovereignty in agreeing to many of the provisions in Nafta. Indeed the
attraction of Nafta for many government officials was precisely that it
would tie the hands of the current and future governments with respect to
tariffs, investment laws, and other parts of economic policy, and thus
restrict sovereignty in an area where Mexican governments had been none too
successful.
Under Nafta, for example, Mexico agrees to abide by the resolutions of
trilateral panels in trade disputes - a clear infringement of sovereignty as
traditionally defined in Mexico. It agrees not to ease environmental
regulations to attract investment; to harmonise norms and standards with the
US and Canada; set, in effect, an external sugar tariff equal to that of the
US, and so on.
As such, common rules on the environment and labour, and trilateral
commissions, would not by themselves violate any new principles of
sovereignty. Mr Jorge Castaneda, a visiting professor at Princeton
University and vocal critic of the Mexican government, says: 'I see no
reason why Mexico should abdicate sovereignty on intellectual property
rights and investment and not on labour and the environment.'
However, there is, as Mr Castaneda himself admits, one important difference:
abdicating sovereignty on investment and property rights will attract
capital and stimulate growth; abdicating sovereignty on labour and the
environment is likely to do the opposite. The government will, in the words
of one official, oppose measures that 'do not make economic sense': that is,
social regulations so onerous they could limit growth.
Direct enforcement of Mexican labour and environmental laws by the US is
unlikely to be the main stumbling block. As Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, has pointed out, the US could not tolerate Mexico helping
enforce US laws, so it could hardly create environment and labour
commissions that let Americans enforce Mexican laws.
Instead, the three countries will look for mechanisms to force each to
comply with labour and environmental conditions in Nafta, according to Mr
Luis Miguel Diaz, legal director in Mexico's foreign relations ministry, and
a side agreement negotiator.
Talks on labour and environment, says Mr Diaz, will follow the same logic as
those on the economic text of Nafta - that they will be co-operative
agreements which in effect compel each country to adapt domestic laws. 'The
limit of the negotiations is that national authorities remain national
authorities, but there will be a system to make countries respond to the
regulations laid out in Nafta.'
The concern for Mexico and Canada is that this 'system' could become
protectionist. The US has proposed giving the trilateral panels power to
impose trade sanctions against a company that fails to comply with its
national environmental and labour laws - sanctions, as it were, that would
punish social dumping.
This could turn into an excuse for US companies to defend themselves against
cheap Mexican exports by claiming the exporting companies did not fully
comply with Mexico's labour and environment laws. Such proposals could
restrict access to the US market, and undo some of the economic benefits of
Nafta for Mexico.

offer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO TOP EC trade negotiators will today try to capitalise on the temporary
ceasefire with the US and make fresh progress on the Gatt Uruguay Round
talks.
Mr Hugo Paemen, the EC's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Thinh Van Tran, EC
ambassador to the Gatt talks in Geneva, will meet their US counterparts in
Washington - three days after the Clinton administration agreed to suspend
sanctions in an escalating dispute over public procurement contracts.
A senior Brussels official said the administration had also offered
encouraging signals by stating for the first time in public that it wants to
make a 'substantial' market access package on goods and services a priority
in the renewed negotiations on a Gatt agreement. 'The statement was exactly
what we had been looking for,' said the official.
The new products in goods and services, suggested by both the US and the EC,
have been added to the this week's US-EC market access negotiations, in the
hopes that agreement will help 'jumpstart' the Gatt negotiations in time to
wrap up the round by the end of the year.
Indications that the market access talks would be broadened came on Friday,
when President Clinton told EC Commission President Jacques Delors that he
would delay sanctions set to go into effect yesterday in the dispute over
government procurement. In a joint US-EC statement, the EC promised 'to
address constructively US concerns'.
Mr Harry Freeman, a Washington trade lobbyist, said the stress on market
access reverses the emphasis in the Gatt negotiations from 'the new issues'
 -such as services and intellectual property rights - to tariff cutting in a
move designed to broaden domestic political support for the Uruguay Round.
The sanctions delay put Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, on
the defensive. He had suggested to Congress that, unlike his predecessors,
he would not back away from threats of retaliation.
Questioned about the administration's change of heart on weekend television,
he said: 'President Delors came to us and asked that we delay it. . .
because he had some constructive suggestions in order to try to meet our
concerns.'
The encouraging signals came after Mr Jacques Delors, met President Bill
Clinton for 50 minutes at the White House and warned him that US sanctions
would provoke a very negative response in Europe. After the warning, the
Commission president was invited to hold talks with Mr Kantor.
In Brussels yesterday, officials were still assessing the motives behind the
suspension of trade sanctions which were due to go into effect yesterday. A
spokesman for Mr Delors said the moves did not necessarily signal a less
aggressive US trade policy. 'We are dealing with signals rather than
certainties.'
The visit of Mr Paemen and Mr Van Tran aims to lay the groundwork for next
week's talks in Brussels between Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, EC
commissioner responsible for external trade relations.
These talks have become a critical test not only of EC/US intentions to
narrow differences on Gatt but also whether they can resolve a series of
nagging bilateral disputes including aviation subsidies, steel trade and
government procurement.
EC officials said yesterday that they hoped the US will consider favourably
the proposal for a joint study of the US and EC disagreements over access to
their res-pective government procurement markets.

THE INCREASE in foreign suppliers' share in the Japanese semiconductor
market to more than 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year has been
welcomed in Japan.
However, Mr Nobuo Kanoi, chairman of the Users Committee of Foreign
Semiconductors, cautioned against relying on short-term market share
figures. While the increased market share was a positive development, it was
important to focus on stable long-term business relationships, he said.
'In the future, as in the past, the global economic environment and
fluctuating exchange rates can influence short-term market share figures. It
is important not to become overly optimistic when the quarterly numbers rise
or overly pessimistic when they do not,' Mr Kanoi said.
Important progress has been made in industrial co-operation. Japan's 10
largest semiconductor users, for example, had prepared 'inquiry lists' as
tools for foreign suppliers to formulate order forecasts.
'No one can deny that the Japanese market is 100 per cent open, or that
tremendous progress has been made to date in improving business
opportunities. . . ,' Mr Kanoi said.
A senior official of Japan's Trade Ministry said yesterday that Japan did
not plan to set market-share targets for foreign goods in any sector beyond
semiconductors, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister for administrative affairs at the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry, was speaking after Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, was quoted as saying the market-share goals might need
to be expanded to other sectors.
The bilateral semiconductor agreement is the only significant trade pact to
set specific targets for a share of the Japanese market. Officials have said
the agreement invited misunderstanding and should not be copied in other
sectors.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, is expected to promote
several backbenchers and junior ministers in a wide-ranging government
reshuffle to be announced today.
Meanwhile, Mr John Hewson, whose Liberal/National party alliance was
unexpectedly trounced by Labor in the March 13 poll, early today beat off a
challenge to his Liberal party leadership. He defeated Mr John Howard, a
former leader, by 47 votes to 30.
In Mr Keating's reshuffle, up to 12 ministers are likely to be replaced and
several others moved as the prime minister stamps his authority on the
government in the wake of his unexpected election victory.
The prime minister is also expected to announce changes to the structure of
the government by merging departments and replacing or moving senior public
servants.
Changes are expected to include the appointment of Mr Ted Evans, Australia's
representative on the International Monetary Fund, to replace Mr Tony Cole,
the Treasury head.
The most prominent ministerial casualty is likely to be Mr John Kerin, trade
minister, who was demoted by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, after
a lacklustre spell as treasurer in 1991.
Several other ministers face the sack, while Mr Keating's freedom of action
has been increased by the retirement from parliament of a number of senior
ministers. Mr Neal Blewett, social security minister, and two other senior
ministers who contested the election have since volunteered to return to the
back benches.
The only minister certain to retain his post is Mr John Dawkins, the
treasurer, who was appointed by Mr Keating shortly after he replaced Mr
Hawke in 1991. But Mr Keating has resisted pressure to give Mr Dawkins the
additional job of deputy prime minister, currently held by Mr Brian Howe,
health minister.
Senator Graham Richardson, a former minister who resigned last year after
allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges,
is expected to return to the government.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Kenya turns away from liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KENYAN government yesterday threw its economic liberalisation programme
into reverse in the face of a deepening economic crisis and a row with
western donors.
In a circular released by the central bank yesterday evening the government
abolished newly introduced 'retention accounts' which allowed exporters to
retain and sell foreign exchange earnings through the interbank market
instead of remitting them to the central bank at a much lower exchange rate.
The circular re-established foreign exchange controls over the three
mainstays of the economy - tea, tourism and coffee - and said foreign funds
currently held in retention accounts should be sold to the central bank
within 48 hours.
The move dealt a crushing blow to the country's exporters, scrapped a
market-determined second tier window of exchange and derailed recent efforts
by the government to win back critically needed quick-disbursing foreign
aid.
President Daniel arap Moi, who last week accused the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank of forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal' reforms on the
economy, was quoted on state-run radio saying the government had no choice
but to re-establish controls.
'As a sovereign state, Kenya will no longer accept any form of economic
arm-twisting from any quarter,' he was reported as saying.
Exasperated donors said the measures marked the desperation of the Kenyan
government and the victory of a group of hardliners in the regime with
massive corrupt interests in a controlled economy.
'It's a complete reversal of trade liberalisation and a return to a managed
import and foreign exchange allocation regime,' said one of Kenya's biggest
western donors. 'Maybe it's time for us to wash our hands of this place.'
In the middle of February the government embarked on bold measures to win
back support from the IMF and World Bank including a partial exchange rate
liberalisation and lifting some price controls.
But the IMF and donors who met in London last week said the government would
have to take further measures before aid worth Dollars 40m (Pounds 27.5m) a
month could be unblocked. They called for policies to squeeze excessive
monetary expansion, end endemic corruption, curb the bloated civil service,
speed privatisation and further liberalise prices and the agricultural
sector.
Donors say the government made a major macro-economic mistake in
liberalising the foreign exchange regime at a time of excessive monetary
expansion. Money supply grew by at least 35 per cent last year, largely as a
result of the central bank pumping at least Ksh10bn-15bn (Pounds 126m-Pounds
188m) into the system through politically connected banks and companies.
The bulk of the money was injected through the pre-shipment financing
facility or by the central bank allowing a handful of politically connected
banks to run up massive overdrafts.
The disclosure last week that the central bank had rolled-over Ksh5.4bn of
loans made through the pre-shipment financing facility to two politically
connected banks after the finance minister had declared the scheme defunct
caused further donor discontent. In the last six weeks the shilling has
plummeted on the interbank market by 60 per cent against convertible
currencies, largely as a result of capital flight and speculation.
With inflation rising to 40-60 per cent and the currency spiralling out of
control the government was faced with having to raise interest rates
massively or scrap its liberalisation programme.
'The scrapping of trade liberalisation shows that the government's reform
effort was merely window dressing to try to win back suspended foreign aid,'
said one western economist. 'They don't have the backbone to confront the
politically powerful interests which have run this economy into the ground.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Tokyo reels under relentless US probing: Finance officials
have endured a grilling on macro-economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION of Professor Larry Summers, the US economist, prompts Japanese
finance ministry officials to shake their heads, draw a deep breath and
mutter: 'That is all very sensitive at the moment.'
Prof Summers is responsible for the Clinton administration's policy on
international economic co-ordination. The sensitivity is caused by the novel
way he has introduced himself to his Japanese colleagues.
He has been behind the dispatch of a long list of detailed questions about
the inner workings of Japanese economic policy. These are not just idle
inquiries. They signal an attention to Japanese policy which has unsettled
the assured elite bureaucrats at the finance ministry.
Japanese officials expected the Clinton administration to take a more
assertive approach in cutting Japan's rising trade surplus.
They were not prepared for questioning on the contents of their
macro-economic plans, which suggests economic policy could become as
contentious as trade policy in US relations with Japan.
The US and Japan differ on several important questions.
Tokyo argues the economy has been given a significant boost through the
Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency spending package agreed last year
combined with the 1993 budget. Most of the increased spending is financed by
higher public sector investment by the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme
(FILP), which is funded by savings deposited through the postal system.
The Tokyo finance ministry says this investment would not have been
undertaken without government action. The US is sceptical. It argues that
the postal savings would have been invested anyway, via the banking system,
to provide savers with a return. The government may have merely diverted
this investment from a private to a public sector channel into the economy.
As a result the US and Japan will differ over the extent of the stimulus
provided by FILP- financed programmes.
The Japanese government argues that last year's package was worth about 2.3
per cent of gross national product. About Y4,000bn was financed by the FILP.
The US estimates the package was worth less than 1 per cent of GNP.
Finance ministry officials want to use the FILP to fund a large part of the
package being planned, which could be worth Y14,000bn. The US has signalled
that it will not take this figure at face value. This scepticism will put
the finance ministry under pressure to tap other sources of finance such as
higher government borrowing. The finance ministry argues that the 1993
budget is a discretionary expansion because it is not attempting to make up
for falling tax revenues by cutting spending. Officials say that in effect
they are cutting taxes.
The US is likely to point to last year's OECD report on the Japanese economy
which said the fall in tax revenue should be regarded as an automatic
adjustment to slower growth rather than a discretionary easing of policy.
The US favours standardised international measures, used by the
International Monetary Fund and the OECD, to assess whether policy is
expansionary. These suggest that Japan has substantial room to expand public
spending.
The OECD says the Japanese general government financial surplus - central
and local government combined with social security funds - was worth 1.7 per
cent of GDP last year, compared with a deficit of 4.8 per cent in the US and
2.9 per cent in Germany. This suggests Japan could increase spending without
excessive borrowing. Japan's net government debt is less than 10 per cent of
GDP while the OECD average is more than 30 per cent.
However, Tokyo insists the government is in surplus only if its social
security fund, worth about 3.5 per cent of GDP, is included in the
calculation. Japan argues that this fund is made up of savings put aside to
pay the pensions of a population which is ageing more rapidly than in any
other OECD country.
The Japanese argue that, if these future liabilities are taken into account,
the government would be in substantial deficit, a point which the OECD
itself has recently accepted. The finance ministry argues that Japan is
further penalised because international measures exclude the deficits of
public corporations which are a significant tool of economic policy in
Japan.
Public corporations such as the Japan Highway Public Corporation and the JNR
railway corporation account for about a fifth of public works spending.
Their deficit, which was worth about 0.4 per cent of GNP in 1990, is rising
rapidly to finance spending on bridges and roads throughout Japan.
When Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrives in Washington on April 15 for
talks with President Clinton he will unveil a plan with an impressive price
tag. But he will find he is facing a much more critical audience than in the
past.
Moreover, these differences over macro-economic policy are unlikely to fade
quickly. Indeed they may cast a shadow over the Group of Seven summit of
industrialised countries to be held in Tokyo in July. Japan is opposed to a
concerted G7 approach to stimulating world growth. President Clinton has
made it clear he favours a 'global growth strategy.'
Over the past few years Japan has grudgingly become used to the US probing
aspects of its business culture in an attempt to open up the Japanese
market. It may have to get used to some of the same treatment in its
macro-economic policy as well.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Algerians protest at growing terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ESTIMATED 80,000 Algerians marched through the centre of Algiers
yesterday to protest against the growing wave of terrorism sweeping the
country.
Similar marches were being held nationwide, called by politicians, trade
unionists, employers, doctors, women's groups and other associations.
'Neither Tehran nor Khartoum,' shouted the crowd, referring to two capitals
which Algerian leaders and the press have often accused over the past year
of sheltering and helping radical Islamic groups.
The government closed state companies and bussed in thousands of employees
to join the Algiers demonstration. But some in the crowd shouted
anti-government slogans.
The wave of repression and terrorism which followed the cancellation, 14
months ago, of elections that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised
to win, has claimed more than 1,000 victims among the security forces and
the fundamentalists.
The terrorism took a new turn last week when two senior civilians and a
surgeon were killed and a fourth just escaped with his life.
Until now, radical Moslem groups have not targeted civilians, even those
associated with the government.
Despite the mounting violence, the High State Council (HCE), Algeria's five
man collegiate presidency, has invited political parties to join in a
dialogue aimed at finding a common platform for discussions on a new
constitution.
The two moderate Islamic parties, Hamas and Nahda, and the former single
ruling party, the FLN, have indicated their readiness to talk. But the two
lay parties, the Front des Forces Socialistes and the Rassemblement pour la
Culture et la Democratie have declined.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Trade unionism in industrialised countries declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNIONISM is in decline across most industrialised economies except
Sweden, according to the annual report of the International Labour Office,
published today
The proportion of workers in unions has dropped sharply in many countries,
with Britain showing the biggest fall to 39 per cent from 55 per cent in
1980.
Membership in the Netherlands fell from 39 per cent to 24 per cent over the
same period. In Germany there was a decline from 36 to 32 per cent and in
Spain from 18 per cent to 11 per cent.
Union membership in France amounts to a mere 10 per cent of the workforce
compared with 18 per cent in 1980, while in the US union membership fell
from 21 per cent to 15 per cent over the past 10 years and in Japan from 30
per cent to 26 per cent.
By contrast in Sweden there was a slight overall rise in membership to 83
per cent of the workforce compared with around 80 per cent in 1980.
The ILO points out that membership levels are not the only way of measuring
union influence.
'Just as important is the extent to which unions are integrated into
national life,' suggests the report.
'In many countries the collective agreements which unions reach are often
extended to cover the whole of the relevant workforce, unionised or not,' it
says. Germany is an example of this.
The ILO also points to the creation of more restrictive laws against unions
by governments and the emergence of employers with union-busting tactics to
explain union decline.
The organisation found Australia the most strike-prone economy in 1991 in
terms of days lost as a result of strikes and lock-outs in manufacturing per
thousand workers. It suffered 891 days not worked.
Spain came second with 537 lost days per thousand workers, followed by New
Zealand with 148.
Britain suffered only 45 lost days per thousand workers, the same as the
Netherlands and among the lowest in the ILO statistics.
On slavery, the ILO estimates up to 33m workers around the world are in
forced labour and up to 30m workers are in what it defines as debt bondage.
This covers workers who are entrapped by employers by being offered a cash
advance which has to be paid off from their future earnings.
The ILO estimates 20m workers in Pakistan (including 7.5m children) are
bonded labourers in industries such as brick-making, quarrying and cigarette
manufacture. In India 15m workers are bonded, of which 10m are children.
The ILO also believes a further 1m workers are in the category of 'modern
forced labour.' These include workers clearing forest in Brazil, sugar cane
workers in Dominica and porters in Burma.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Egypt focuses firepower on militants: Islamic extremists
have forced Cairo to write off tourist revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S government seems to have decided to write off the rest of this
year's tourist season.
A couple of weeks ago, the government did its best to play down the recent
attacks by Islamic militants on tourists. It blamed the media for
exaggerating their gravity and hired Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to burnish the
country's image abroad.
Government spokesmen said violence by the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the extremist
group aiming to install an Islamic state in Egypt, had peaked and that 90
per cent of its members had been captured in security sweeps late last year
and early this.
The government seemed determined to rescue what it could of its tourist
revenues, which according to Mr Fouad Sultan, tourism minister, are 20 per
cent down on last year's record levels, when the industry earned Egypt a
precious Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.25bn). Non-government estimates suggest
revenues might in fact be down by half or more.
Now, however, the government appears to have decided that it is more
important to take the fight to the militants than keep Egypt comfortingly
out of the news.
Since the start of this month, which saw the most violent clashes between
police and militants in a decade, a series of raids on Gama'a hideouts and,
in one case, a full mosque in Aswan has left more than 40 people dead,
including at least 10 policemen.
The government denies it is operating a shoot-to-kill policy against the
Islamic militants, but is taking massive firepower with it in raids on
suspected hideouts. More than 1,000 police, some armed with rocket-propelled
grenades, for instance, took part in a nine-hour shoot-out in Asyut this
week in which 10 militants were killed.
The decision to step up the campaign against the Gama'a appears to reflect
two discomforting factors for the government.
The first is that its claim to have rooted out the militants has proven
unfounded. Police and troops continue to be shot and killed in sporadic
incidents in both Upper Egypt - the Gama'a's chief stronghold - and Cairo.
Even in the face of tougher policing and tighter security at all main
tourist spots, the Gama'a still managed to blow up tourist buses last week
outside the Egyptian museum, a prime tourist attraction. Yesterday it vowed
to avenge the Asyut killings with more attacks in Cairo.
The second factor is that the Gama'a's aim of hurting the economy, as a
means of destabilising the government, has been disconcertingly successful.
Not only is the tourism industry, the country's fastest growing and
potentially most lucrative, likely to lose about Dollars 700m this year, but
some investors in Egypt's ambitious tourism development projects are
reported to be getting cold feet.
Businessmen have also been increasingly skittish since the Gama'a said they
might direct attacks at foreign investments in the country. Earlier this
week the US embassy called in members of the American business community to
reassure them that there was no reason to panic. But it is a sign of the
concern among businessmen that most say they unreservedly back the use of
considerable violence against the extremists. 'The government must be very,
very brutal indeed,' says one.
There is a wide divergence of views among businessmen, diplomats and other
observers as to the real gravity of the militants' threat. But few doubt
that the considerable might of Egypt's security forces can contain it - even
if it not at once. 'The next three months will be very difficult for the
government to control the situation,' says one leading businessman. 'But for
my money I'd prefer it this way, to have it out in the open. Let's get on
with it and get it finished.'
Few, however, believe that force alone will eradicate the threat from
militant Islamic groups.
In fact, the government has employed more weapons against the Islamic
militants than just guns, and broadened its attack to include the officially
banned Moslem Brotherhood, which for 60 years has represented Egypt's main
Islamic political grouping and commands significant support.
Parliament has passed a law aimed at making it more difficult for the
Brotherhood to dominate the elections to professional syndicates, most of
which they control. The government is trying to bring all the country's
mosques under state control and supply the texts for the Friday sermon.
The government is also planning to improve services in some of the country's
worst slums and increase investment in the poorest parts of Upper Egypt,
where poverty is believed to offer the Gama'a fertile ground for recruitment
among Egypt's thousands of disillusioned, young unemployed.
But there are growing calls in Egypt for more radical action. 'The
government should have an integrated policy to change the society
religiously, economically and socially,' says Mr Said Ashmawy, chief justice
of the supreme court for state security, who believes that without radical
changes to liberalise its administration, de-Islamicise the state media and
reform the country's education system, 'terrorism unfortunately will last
for many years'.
That would be profoundly bad news for the Egyptian government, which faces
political hurdles enough in pushing through tough economic reforms under
joint IMF and World Bank programmes.
Equally, the recent violence gives the government a political card to play
with the IMF when it opens negotiations on a second agreement with the Fund
in the next few weeks.
When President Hosni Mubarak meets President Clinton in Washington early
next month he will almost certainly underline the terrorist threat when the
administration brings up the subject of US aid, of which Egypt is the second
biggest recipient after Israel.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Keating puts his stamp on cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, is expected to promote
several backbenchers and junior ministers in a wide-ranging government
reshuffle to be announced today.
Up to 12 ministers are likely to be replaced and several others moved as Mr
Keating stamps his authority on the government following Labor's unexpected
victory in last week's federal election.
The prime minister is also expected to announce changes to the structure of
the government by merging departments and replacing or moving senior public
servants.
Senior bureaucratic changes are expected to include the appointment of Mr
Ted Evans, Australia's representative on the International Monetary Fund, to
replace Mr Tony Cole, head of the Treasury.
The most prominent ministerial casualty is likely to be Mr John Kerin, trade
minister, who was demoted by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, after
a lacklustre spell as treasurer (finance minister) in 1991.
Several other ministers face the sack, but Mr Keating's freedom of action
has been increased by the retirement from parliament of a number of senior
ministers including Senator John Button, the industry minister.
Mr Neal Blewett, social security minister, and two other senior ministers
who contested the election have since volunteered to return to the back
benches.
The only minister certain to retain his present appointment is Mr John
Dawkins, the treasurer, who was appointed by Mr Keating shortly after he
replaced Mr Hawke in 1991.
However, Mr Keating has resisted pressure to give Mr Dawkins the additional
post of deputy prime minister, currently held by Mr Brian Howe, the
relatively low-profile health minister.
Senator Graham Richardson, a former minister who resigned last year after
allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges,
is expected to return to the government.
The scale of the likely changes reflects Mr Keating's desire to reshape the
ministerial team he inherited from Mr Hawke, which included several
lacklustre ministers appointed in the early 1980s.
The government's unexpected election victory has given Mr Keating greater
than usual power over Labor's three ideological factions, which select the
ministry, leaving the prime minister to allocate portfolios.
Meanwhile, the defeated Liberal and National parties - partners in the
conservative opposition coalition - will hold separate leadership ballots
today.
Mr Tim Fischer is likely to be returned as National leader, but Mr John
Hewson, the Liberal leader, faces a strong challenge from Mr John Howard,
the party's employment spokesman.
Mr Howard led the coalition to defeat in the 1987 election, but is widely
believed to have lost largely because of a maverick intervention by Mr Jo
Bjelke-Petersen, the then conservative premier of Queensland.
Mr Howard's free market views are similar to those held by Mr Hewson, but he
has promised a wide-ranging review of existing policies if he wins the
leadership vote. Both candidates claim to have sufficient support to win.

Amnesty International yesterday said Egypt appeared to be operating a 'shoot
to kill' policy in recent raids on suspected Islamic militants, and called
for an 'urgent review' of the use of lethal force by police, writes Mark
Nicholson.
It said that reported police instructions to 'shoot to kill' militants who
resist the security forces 'looks like an official licence to kill with
impunity.'
In a statement which also condemned arbitrary killing by Islamic groups,
Amnesty said: 'The human rights situation in Egypt has suffered a serious
deterioration' in the past year.

AN ARAB stabbed and wounded six Israelis in a Jerusalem school playground
yesterday and soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in the occupied Gaza
Strip, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
Israelis demonstrated and threw stones after the stabbings, which put
pressure on prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to stop a wave of bloodshed. Police
stopped a crowd from lynching the attacker.
Rabin cut short a US trip on Friday because of the violence.
In the southern Gaza refugee camp of Rafah, soldiers shot dead 11-year-old
Mohammad Jarbou, the ninth Palestinian killed by Israelis in the Strip in a
week.
UN officials said he was shot in the neck leaving school during sporadic
stone-throwing protests.
In the town of Khan Younis in the Strip, soldiers shot dead a muezzin, a
Moslem who calls worshippers to prayer at the mosque, Palestinians said.
Mr Rabin said Palestinians would get nothing from Israel through violence.
'I believe that in the long run a real solution to the problem is around the
negotiation table,' he told reporters.
He responded to criticism by right-wing opponents and ordinary Israelis of
his handling of security by pledging on Sunday to increase the police force
by 1,550 officers.
Two Israeli soldiers were killed in ambushes and troops shot dead four
Palestinians over the weekend.

FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Paris-Bonn axis faces pressure - A
conservative government will adopt a hard line in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATION between Paris and Bonn represents the traditional driving force
behind the development of the European Community. But the French
conservatives' crushing victory, underlining the unpopular effects of the
Socialist government's policy of linking the franc to the D-Mark, may pose
severe tests for Franco-German cohesion.
The likelihood that the new French government may toughen France's line on
the Gatt trade talks is injecting additional uncertainty into economic
policy questions.
There is also worry in Spain - which faces general elections in the autumn -
that the Socialists' rout may undermine the pro-European policies of Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist prime minister.
Professor Michael Sturmer, director of the German foreign policy think-tank,
Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, said that France and Germany had no
option but to maintain strong ties: 'The French want to run European
policies, but they cannot do it on their own. And the Germans need someone
to lean on.' But the German Bundesbank could come under 'enormous pressure'
to head off the risk that the new French government might seek to sever the
franc/D-Mark parity.
Prof Sturmer said that he saw the need for 'plain speaking' by Bonn to the
prospective right-wing government, to emphasise the importance of a Gatt
trade deal.
There could be a 'trade-off' here affecting the Bundesbank's willingness to
cut interest rates to help the French economy, he suggested.
In Brussels, European Community officials said that the conservatives'
landslide might make France's European policies much less predictable. Most
senior European Commission officials believe the French opposition's pledge
to stick to the franc fort policy, but some Community officials worry that
strains caused by cohabitation between a weakened President Francois
Mitterrand and an assertive conservative government may reinforce the
present political drift in the EC.
'We may be in for a period of prolonged infighting,' said one senior
official in Brussels yesterday. There is anxiety in Brussels over the French
conservatives having pledged to re-open the EC-US farm trade deal, widely
viewed as the pre-requisite for a Gatt conclusion.
One view in Brussels is that Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader, may
provoke a Gatt crisis to strengthen his domestic position. This would be at
the expense of upsetting his EC partners, particularly Germany.
Speculation about the new French government's monetary policy difficulties
has coincided with fresh evidence of Bundesbank scepticism about the targets
agreed at Maastricht for economic and monetary union. Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the Bundesbank president, yesterday emphasised Germany's own problems in
meeting the Emu fiscal objectives.
According to Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland
in Frankfurt: 'The failure of the Socialists to win a single seat in the
first round does raise the question of whether there will be a reassessment
of the franc fort policy.'
Mr Matthys van der Want, chief economist at Pierson, Heldring, Pierson, the
Amsterdam merchant bank, said that he did not expect a 'weakening' of
Bonn-Paris links, especially since the Bundesbank is now in the midst of a
process of gradual interest rate cuts.
However, he added that France would run into problems unless the Bundesbank
cut its benchmark interest rates by at least a further two percentage points
by the fourth quarter. In view of the strong links between the French and
Spanish Socialist parties, the result sent a nervous ripple through the
Madrid government.
'The French result will affect the Spanish government in that it may force
it to change its strict fiscal and monetary policies,' said Mr Joaquin
Tamames, a leading Madrid business consultant.
Like many analysts, Mr Tamames believes the government is already softening
its economic policy position in the face of polls showing the Socialists
rapidly losing ground to their conservative opponents.
On the other hand, Professor Pedro Schwartz, one of Spain's leading liberal
economists, said he believed the French vote would not move Mr Gonzalez. 'I
don't think he can win any votes by walking away from his policies.'
He added that Mr Gonzalez would be most helped by a crisis in Russia or in
the EC . 'That would set Spaniards looking for a safe pair of hands rather
than for change,' he said.

FROM the moment that Mr Michel Sapin, the mild-mannered justice minister,
took over as France's finance minister when Mr Pierre Beregovoy assumed the
premiership last year, there was no doubt who was really in charge of the
French economy.
Mr Beregovoy, or Super-Bere as the French press called him in his days at
the Finance Ministry, made it clear from the beginning that he would
continue to control the economy from the prime minister's office in the
Hotel Matignon.
The unfortunate Mr Sapin, 40, had no choice but to spend his 10 months as
finance minister executing the instructions of his predecessor. As if to add
insult to injury, Mr Sapin on Sunday lost his parliamentary seat in the
Hauts-de-Seine district to the west of Paris. Mr Sapin, a career politician
who went into parliament in 1981 shortly after graduating from France's
elite Ecole Nationale de l'Administration, may be seen as a 'yes man', but
at least he is deemed to have played the part efficiently.
He has been as determined as Mr Beregovoy in his defence of the Socialists'
franc fort currency support policy. Indeed, Mr Sapin's only brush with
controversy was his verbal assault on the British and American speculators
who were attacking the franc.

FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Business looks for swift interest rate
cuts - This would aid the new government in implementing its privatisation
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADLINE emblazoned across yesterday's La Tribune Desfosses, the French
financial newspaper, was short and to the point: 'New government - the
business community expects swift, spectacular policies'.
The chief concern of French financiers and industrialists is how quickly the
conservatives, now set to return to power after a resounding victory in the
first round of the parliamentary elections, will be able to reduce interest
rates.
They are keen for the new government to implement the privatisation
programme outlined in its election manifesto. There is also feverish
speculation as to whether the right will continue the Gallic political
tradition of dismissing the Socialist chairmen of France's state-controlled
companies.
However, the immediate priority for the corporate sector is interest rates.
The Socialists refused to reduce rates for fear of imperilling the French
franc, preferring to wait for German rates to fall so that France could
follow suit without jeopardising the currency.
As a result, French companies face the parallel problems of high interest
rates depressing domestic demand and the strong franc impeding their export
efforts.
The conservatives claimed to be committed to continuing the franc fort
policy in their election manifesto. However, rogue voices in both parties -
Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe Seguin in the RPR and Mr Alain Madelin in
the UDF - have argued for devaluation.
'The markets are still waiting for a firm commitment that the new government
will adhere to the franc fort,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French
economist at Salomon Brothers. 'There is also concern that, if German rates
have not come down significantly by the summer, the calls for devaluation
from the conservatives will grow louder.'
A reduction in interest rates is also essential if the conservatives are to
implement their privatisation plans. High rates will make it more difficult
to encourage private investors to buy equities. The new administration also
faces the problem that the Paris stock market is now far less buoyant than
in 1986, when the right last took power.
The conservatives hope to stimulate equity investment by introducing tax
breaks, possibly for long-term investments of up to FFr50,000 (Pounds
6,273). James Capel in Paris calculates that this could bring FFr50bn of new
private investment into the stock market each year. The new government may
also consider abolishing the Bourse tax on equity investment.
'Although market conditions are less favourable than in 1986, there is no
reason that the first tranche of privatisations should not start in early
summer,' said Mr David Harrington, French market strategist at James Capel.
'It is partly a question of pragmatics. The conservatives need to raise
money to plug the budget deficit.'
The critical question is which companies will go first. Some candidates are
too sickly to be privatised at present, notably Credit Lyonnais, the bank
which last year produced its worst performance for two decades, and Bull,
the computer group that has for four years been in the red. Analysts suspect
that the new government will start with more robust businesses such as
Assurances Generales de France in insurance and Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals.
The conservatives may also adopt a different approach to the management of
the remaining state companies, by encouraging them to float off subsidiaries
and being more relaxed about job losses.
There is also speculation that they might renegotiate the recent acquisition
of Yves Saint-Laurent, the fashion house headed by Mr Pierre Berge, a close
friend of President Francois Mitterrand, by part of Elf-Aquitaine, the
public sector oil group. The deal, due to be completed in May, has been
fiercely criticised by the right.
One of the first tasks of the new administration will be to scrutinise the
heads of the state-controlled companies. Mr Loi Le Floch-Prigent of
Elf-Aquitaine, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer of Credit Lyonnais and Mr Gilles Menage
of Electricite de France are all seen as vulnerable.
They may yet be safe. Mr Edouard Balladur, favourite for prime minister, has
already said he does not relish the prospect of a corporate witch-hunt.

FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Right aims for Louis XVI presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YOU would have to go back into early 19th century French history to find a
comparable conservative majority, if France's centre-right parties were to
achieve in next Sunday's run-off elections for the National Assembly the
maximum projected for them as a result of last Sunday's first ballot.
The top limit of the range of seats predicted for the neo-Gaullist
Republican Rally (RPR) and centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF) is
480 seats out of the 577 total. That, said one commentator yesterday, would
leave President Francois Mitterrand with 'as much authority as Louis XVI'
after he was brought back to revolutionary Paris from Varennes.
But second rounds in French elections are a chance for second thoughts. This
is why most pollsters put the bottom range of the RPR/UDR eventual score in
seats at around 440, with the outside possibility that the Socialists -
having failed to gain a single seat in the first ballot - might pick up as
many as 80, admittedly far short of the 262 seats which they and their
allies held in the last parliament.
There are two reasons why the pendulum might swing back slightly from the
right. One is that more people might vote next Sunday than did last Sunday,
when 31.07 per cent of the electorate stayed away from the polling booths.
This abstention rate is high compared to the last cohabitation election in
1986 when the RPR/UDF first entered government under the Mitterrand
presidency. Socialist appeals for a common front against the right might
bring out more left-wing voters in six days' time. The second factor is
known as desistement, in which second-round candidates of the left desist in
favour of the one among them best placed to beat the right, with the same
tactics happening on the right. The way in which such desistement can affect
the outcome is well illustrated by Sunday's outcome in Gardanne, near
Marseilles, which Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman, is trying to keep for
the Socialists. He scored 25.6 per cent, his RPR challenger 24.28 per cent,
the Communist 19.31 per cent, and the extreme-right National Front 18.97 per
cent. All four are in a run-off race of unusual symmetry between left and
right.
Adding to the Socialists' weakness is the fact that in this election the
party has no electoral pacts with others, though it has at least a history
of striking bargains with the Communists. There is no such track record of
co-operation with Les Verts and Generation Ecologie. Indeed, the Socialists
have really messed up their relations with this green alliance.
They waited until last week, when the greens were beginning to slump in the
polls, to suggest a tactical voting pact. Had they proposed this when the
environmentalists were riding high in the polls (at one point ahead of the
Socialists, at 20 per cent), the Socialists could have given the greens, and
in the end themselves, a real fillip. Now that the ecologists have crashed
to a total 7.6 per cent vote in the first round, they are not much good to
the Socialists. With Mr Brice Lalonde, the GE leader, and Mr Antoine
Waechter, the leader of Les Verts, knocked out in the first round, most
greens feel too sore with Socialist opportunism to want to co-operate now.
By contrast, the RPR and UDF are solid, at least on paper. In more than 500
constituencies they fielded a single candidate in the first round, and 78 of
them gained an outright victory (42 for the RPR, 36 for the UDF). In 52 of
the 70 seats where the RPR and UDF ran a kind of US-style primary election
against each other, the RPR candidate did better than the UDF one. Where,
therefore, both candidates did well enough to appear in the run-off, it
would seem to be up to the UDF in most cases to give way. That is indeed
what opposition leaders decided in their 'code of good conduct'.
But the centrist, particularly the Christian Democrat, wing of the UDF
thinks otherwise. With some reason, they argue that they are naturally
better placed than hardline Gaullists to pick loose votes in the centre. And
they got backing from Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The UDF president said
that, while he 'would take no risk' of letting a Socialist get back in,
'when the choice is just between opposition candidates, it will be the
electors who will decide.'
The reason for this jostling between the partners in France's future
coalition government is that each wants to provide the prime minister
nominated by President Mitterrand next week. If, as now seems likely, the
RPR wins most seats, that job will go to one of its men, probably Mr Edouard
Balladur. But desperately keen to shake its image of being the RPR's little
brother, the UDF is conceding nothing until the polling booths close, again,
at 8 pm next Sunday.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Amato quickly fills agriculture post: Italian premier moves
to repair damage caused by latest resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, yesterday sought to shake off
his administration's lame-duck image by quickly naming a new agriculture
minister - 24 hours after the incumbent had resigned following a police raid
on his home in connection with the nationwide corruption inquiry.
Former Christian Democrat senator, Mr Alfredo Diana, was appointed to the
post vacated on Sunday by the resignation of Mr Gianni Fontana, who became
the fourth minister in just over a month swept from office by the corruption
scandals.
Instead of marking time until the next main event in the political calendar
 -the referendums set for April 18 - without replacing the minister, Mr
Amato opted for decisive action.
One of the 10 referendums concerns the abolition of the Ministry of
Agriculture and the devolution of decisions in agricultural matters to the
regions. However, the agricultural minister has to watch over at least three
key and controversial areas - the future of the Gatt talks and the impact of
any agreement on Italian farmers, especially of oilseeds; the bitter dispute
between Italy and the EC over milk quotas; and this month's outbreak of foot
and mouth disease in Italy, caused by cattle imported from Croatia, which
has led to a tough ban on meat exports.
These considerations, combined with the obvious signals of weakness in any
decision not to replace Mr Fontana, appeared to have persuaded the prime
minister to act.
As the portfolio was held by the Christian Democrats it was filled from
within their ranks, although Mr Amato could have opted for a technocrat.
Mr Fontana, 48, is under investigation by magistrates in his home base of
Verona for alleged illicit financing of political parties.
A total of six ministers have resigned since the Amato government was first
formed at the end of June last year.
Among them, Mr Giovanni Goria, who resigned as finance minister because of
his alleged involvement in irregularities in a savings bank scandal, has
since been cleared by magistrates.
Another, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the former EC commissioner who resigned as
Italy's environment minister last month and left the Socialist party in
protest at Mr Amato's attempts to find a political solution to the judicial
problems presented by the corruption scandals, was elected the leader of the
Green party over the weekend.
Mr Amato still faces an uphill task in being able to convince both the
members of his own four-party coalition and the rest of parliament that he
has the will to keep governing.
The leaders of most of the political parties have begun discussions to
consider whether a new, broader-based government should be formed after the
referendums to carry out essential constitutional reforms.
But the positions of the parties remain riven by internal rivalries and
suspicions.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Stone walls do a prison make: Two colourful Italians learn
that clinics are no substitute for a jail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIANS, it seems, can no longer 'do time' in a clinic as a substitute for
landing in a prison. This appears to be the message behind the fate of two
of Rome's more colourful business figures, Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, owner of
Roma football team, and Mr Mauro Leone, son of former President of the
Republic Giovanni Leone.
Both have landed in a Rome prison on fraud charges concerning some L300m
(Pounds 136,860) of funds in alleged false billings and rental contracts
connected with finance subsidiaries of Efim, the state industrial holding
put in liquidation last July.
In the past, lawyers have usually been able to persuade Italian courts that
important figures with health problems should be allowed to remain in
hospital. Now, Mr Leone, 45, has been forced to leave a Rome clinic where he
had been for a week.
Mr Ciarrapico avoided this indignity by being in a London clinic, whence his
lawyers sought to negotiate his return to a Rome hospital to face the fraud
charges.
He happens to be the owner of several Rome clinics, and part of the charges
relate to alleged false leases on hospitals.
The magistrates insisted he had to return and go to a jail, at best the
prison sanatorium. This he did on Sunday in style, in a jet of his own
air-taxi company.
Yesterday, Mr Ciarrapico underwent his first interrogation in jail, with his
lawyers confident he would be able to demonstrate his innocence.
Though now known for his association with Roma football team, Mr Ciarrapico
is also dubbed the king of mineral water, because of his extensive interests
in that commodity.
More important, Mr Ciarrapico is seen as a peculiarly Roman phenomenon, a
businessman very publicly identified with politics. Mr Ciarrapico has been
closely associated with Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat
prime minister.
Equally, Mr Leone is regarded as an example of someone who has risen to
business prominence as a result of the political connections of his father,
operating in the labyrinthine world of Italian state-controlled companies.
He is being charged with fraud in his role as deputy chairman of Efim and in
connection with his being in charge of the latter's leasing and factoring
subsidiaries, Safim Leasing and Safim Factor.
Earlier this month, Mr Ciarrapico was sentenced to two years' jail for
irregularities in the purchase of one of Rome's best known cafe-restaurants.
He is also contesting a sentence concerning involvement in the fraudulent
bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Greek current account gap wider despite rise in tourism

GREECE'S current account deficit widened by 33.4 per cent to Dollars 2.03bn
(Pounds 1.42bn) last year, despite a marked increase in tourism earnings and
high levels of European Community transfers.
The trade deficit worsened by 12.5 per cent, to Dollars 13.84bn, with export
earnings covering less than one-third of import payments.
According to central bank officials, the larger-than-expected deficit
reflected the effects of last autumn's upheaval on European currency
markets. The government had forecast a current account shortfall of Dollars
1.6bn for 1992, based on reduced growth in imports as economic stabilisation
continued.
Imports jumped sharply in October in response to fears that the drachma
would be devalued, while foreign currency inflows were held back. Imports
totalled Dollars 19.85bn in 1992, a 3.9 per cent rise.
The government's strong drachma policy, tying the currency to the D-Mark, is
blamed for an 11.6 per cent decline in export earnings to Dollars 6.01bn.
Greek products grew less competitive towards the end of 1992 after the lira
and peseta were devalued.
However, the invisibles surplus improved by 9.5 per cent last year, thanks
to a record number of tourist arrivals. Receipts from tourism, still
Greece's biggest single source of foreign exchange earnings, surged by 27.3
per cent to Dollars 3.27bn.
Remittances from Greeks living abroad rose more slowly, by 9.5 per cent to
Dollars 2.37bn.
EC transfers remained steady at Dollars 4.06bn, equivalent to almost 5 per
cent of Greece's gross domestic product. While two-thirds of Greek income
from the Community covers support payments to farmers, the government has
grown more efficient at tapping EC structural funds, drawing down more than
90 per cent of available funding last year.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Demirel prospers as Kurdish rebels fall out: A look at the
alternatives for Ankara as the threat from guerrillas weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, was careful not to reject
it out of hand, but many Turks privately dismiss last week's ceasefire
declaration by Apo Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the rebel Kurdish Workers
party (PKK), as yet another ploy to gain time.
There is, however, an important difference from earlier ceasefire offers,
beyond the fact that Mr Ocalan wore a suit and tie for the first time anyone
can remember. Unlike other occasions, Turkey has a chance to offer reforms
for its 10m-strong Kurdish minority without being accused of caving in to
extremism.
Both on the military front and to some extent with western opinion, the
perception from Ankara is that the tide is fast turning in Turkey's favour
at the expense of the PKK.
The generals will no doubt be counselling the prime minister to press home
the military advantage. The alternative course is to push on with
far-reaching legal and cultural reforms, which western diplomats believe is
the only way to win over moderate Kurdish opinion and resolve the problem.
Mr Demirel appears in no mood to enter negotiations with the PKK or even the
Kurdish deputies in the Turkish parliament. It will be particularly
difficult to convince his hardline colleagues of the need for magnanimity.
Nonetheless, there is clear relief that this weekend's Kurdish new year
celebrations passed off relatively peacefully, unlike last year, when more
than 90 people died after government forces used tanks and armoured
personnel carriers to reassert control in a string of towns on Turkey's
borders with Iraq and Syria.
Since that crisis, the Turks have fast improved their counter-insurgency
tactics against a weakly armed and inexperienced guerrilla force. The
purchase of US Black Hawk helicopters has provided a new, fast reaction
capability.
Turkey's army, while mostly made up of conscripts, has officers with a
wealth of experience, many of them having spent all their professional lives
fighting the PKK. The security forces have played on divisions in the
Kurdish community already strained by the revival of an earlier wave of
bloody rivalry between hardline Kurdish Islamic groups. All of this has
served further to weaken the PKK's support among the people.
Diplomatically, the Turks have made important gains. For all his wife's
campaigning for the Kurdish cause, French President Francois Mitterrand has
openly declared his opposition to the PKK's methods and aspirations for a
separate state. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, made much the
same pronouncement.
Even some of Germany's politicians, despite the attractions of the Kurdish
cause as a domestic issue, have moved to condemn the PKK as a terrorist
force.
The PKK's ability to sustain the conflict has long depended on being able to
to infiltrate trained fighters across Turkey's borders. Today the PKK's
Syrian backers, increasingly isolated since the end of the cold war and the
withdrawal of Soviet patronage, are keen to improve ties with Ankara. Iran
too seems less inclined to foment the crisis.
The real test came in tacit co-operation with Iraq's Kurdish peshmerga
rebels, whose increasingly close ties with Ankara reflect an anxiety not to
alienate the Turks, who control the vital aid lifeline and provide air bases
for the allied air umbrella.
The PKK was forced from its bases in northern Iraq; even now the peshmerga
leadership is still reluctant to elaborate on its role in this.
In the wake of the Gulf war, Turkey's western allies were rarely comfortable
explaining to their public why they condoned Ankara's heavy-handed
repression of its own Kurdish minority while the west offered support to the
Kurds in Iraq. Diplomats now say that, more than any other issue, the sight
of Kurds fighting Kurds has served to change the way that western public
opinion views the Kurdish cause.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Amato prepares to replace minister: Italian premier moves to
repair damage caused by further resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Amato government yesterday sought to shake off the image of a lame-duck
administration in the wake of the weekend resignation of Mr Gianni Fontana,
minister of agriculture, who had become swept up in Italy's continuing
corruption scandals.
Instead of marking time until the next main event in the political calendar
 -the referendums set for April 18 - without replacing him, Mr Giuliano
Amato, the prime minister, yes terday said that he intended to appoint a new
minister as soon as possible.
It had been previously suggested that Mr Amato would make no new appointment
at least until the referendums. One of the 10 referendums concerns the
abolition of the Ministry of Agriculture and the devolution of decisions in
agricultural matters to the regions.
However, the agricultural minister has to watch over at least three key and
controversial areas - the future of the Gatt talks and the impact of any
agreement on Italian farmers, especially of oilseeds; the bitter dispute
between Italy and the EC over milk quotas; and this month's outbreak of foot
and mouth disease in Italy, caused by cattle imported from Croatia, which
has led to a tough ban on meat exports.
These considerations, combined with the obvious signals of weakness in any
decision not to replace Mr Fontana, appear to have persuaded the prime
minister.
The portfolio was held by the Christian Democrats and replacement would have
to come either from the same party or from the ranks of technocrats.
Mr Fontana, 48, is under investigation by magistrates in his home base of
Verona for alleged illicit financing of political parties. He is the fourth
minister to resign in just over a month.
Mr Giovanni Goria, who resigned as finance minister because of his alleged
involvement in irregularities in a savings bank scandal, has since been
cleared by magistrates.
Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana the former EC commissioner, who resigned
as Italy's environment minister last month and left the Socialist party in
protest at Mr Amato's attempts to find a political solution to the judicial
problems presented by the corruption scandals, was elected the leader of the
Green party over the weekend.
A total of six ministers have resigned since the Amato government was first
formed at the end of June last year.
The prime minister now faces an uphill task in convincing both the members
of his own four-party coalition and the rest of parliament that he has the
will to keep governing.
The leaders of most of the political parties have begun discussions to
consider whether a new, broader-based government should be formed after the
referendums to carry out essential constitutional reforms.
But the parties' positions remain riven by internal rivalries and
suspicions.

FT  23 MAR 93 / EC pact on monitoring emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC ENVIRONMENT ministers last night agreed standardised mechanisms to
monitor the Twelve's commitments to cut carbon dioxide emissions.
Policing this main greenhouse gas will highlight whether measures planned so
far can meet the EC's undertaking to stabilise CO output at 1990 levels by
2000.
It could thus underline the need for the European Commission's controversial
carbon/energy tax if conventional energy efficiency measures, designed to
cut emissions and combat global warming, prove insufficient.
Agreement was held up by British insistence that a clear difference be
established between monitoring and implementation, and that responsibility
for measuring emissions should lie squarely with each member state.
But wider differences among the Twelve over the EC strategy to fight global
warming while protecting competitive advantage in the middle of a recession
were also on display. How to share out the cuts has not been resolved.
EC environment commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas said that national
programmes to cut CO output would still see emissions at 3 per cent over
1990 levels in 2000, underlining the need for the tax Brussels wanted. The
tax would put Dollars 3 (Pounds 2.10) on each barrel of oil equivalent,
rising to Dollars 10 by 2000, with half on the fuel content of all
non-renewable fuel and half on its carbon content.
Industry is hostile to the tax because of its implications for competition,
despite the US administration's recent proposal to tax fuel.
But northern countries such as Germany, Holland and Denmark strongly back
the tax. They have set themselves higher emission reduction targets - and
some countries fear these more difficult goals could creep into any form of
monitoring which bordered on policing. The UK is reticent, and more so after
its recent decision to levy its own fuel taxes.
Spain is strongly opposed to the tax, arguing that richer countries that
emit more CO should be set higher cuts.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Yeltsin receives encouraging regional backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin's weekend break-out from his constitutional dead end
yesterday received greater support from the regions of Russia than had been
expected by his opponents in the Russian parliaments.
Meetings of regional councils are running roughly equally for and against Mr
Yeltsin's imposition of 'special rule' and his announcement of a popular
vote on the division of powers on April 25.
The regional councils in Sverdlovsk, Mr Yeltsin's home base when he was a
regional party secretary, Samara, Altai, Kamchatka, Krasnodar and Kurgan Ude
said they favoured a popular vote.
Mr Anatoly Grebenkin, head of the Sverdlovsk council, called Mr Yeltsin's
decision 'courageous' and forecast that 'by raising the stakes, he may
mobilise the population in his support'.
The Kamchatka council appealed to the Russian Supreme Council to put the
people's trust in the body to a popular vote - a barbed request, given the
consistently low rating for the Russian parliament in public opinion polls.
However, other key areas were no less firmly against, many of them saying
they would not organise Mr Yeltsin's proposed vote in their areas. These
included the regions or republics of the Kuzbass, Kemerovo, Karelia,
Stavropol, Chelyabinsk and Sakhalin.
Mr Aman Tuleev, leader of the Kemerovo regional council, a candidate for the
presidency and an increasingly ferocious opponent of Mr Yeltsin, said the
Russian president had 'practically deposed lawful power in the country'.
A few sat on the fence, like the Union of Don Cossacks, whose leader, Mr
Vasily Kalegin, said the legislative and executive powers were 'behaving
like children, asking who loved them most'.
The newly independent states of the former Soviet Union which yesterday
reacted to the weekend moves generally supported Mr Yeltsin, though many
declined to make their views known.
Support for Mr Yeltsin was also evident from the wider, former communist
world. Ukraine, the second largest Slav state, with a history of fractious
relationships with Russia, came out in strong support of the proposal for a
popular vote. President Leonid Kravchuk said: 'I fully support the Russian
leadership's course on reforms and am certain it can be carried out only
through national consensus.'
The Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania also strongly supported Mr
Yeltsin.
Latvia's Supreme Soviet chairman, Mr Anatolijs Gorbunovs, was more measured,
saying that 'we hope the president elected by the Russian people and the
government will efficiently pursue the course of reforms'. Armenia came out
for Mr Yeltsin but the central Asian states of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan
were reserved, the latter claiming more time was needed to study the
situation.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Krupp men yearn for 1988: The restructuring of the German
steel industry as part of the upheaval in the sector throughout Europe has
elicited widespread protest. FT writers report on the hopes and fears of two
communities in east and west Germany

<TEXT>
DICKMAN Hock, a worker at Krupp Stahl's plant in Rheinhausen, sweats and
pants as he moves the wrought iron bollard around and settles it into fresh
cement. Behind the green bollard, torn by protesting steel workers from the
pavement in front of the state government's seat in Dusseldorf, a handful of
his colleagues look on gloomily.
Every day since the closure of the plant was announced last month they stand
in front of Gate 1 and wish they were back in 1988.
Then, Rheinhausen embodied the industrial might of German steel workers.
After a six-month sit-in by workers, the management of Krupp Stahl, the
second largest steel producer in Germany, reversed its decision to close the
oldest steel plant in the Ruhr valley.
Today, the days of radical labour unrest in the heartland of industrial
Germany are gone. Despite a series of protests workers admit solidarity no
longer exists and closure of the plant is unavoidable.
With jobs disappearing across the industry, workers say they no longer have
the spirit to fight together. Instead, the plight of the steel industry has
pitted plants against plants, a situation exploited by management in its
attempt to make closure acceptable.
Unlike 1988, when closure was announced overnight, Krupp's management
unveiled plans last January to shut a whole integrated plant either in
Rheinhausen or in Dortmund, 20km away.
'That strategy killed workers' solidarity,' says Karlheinz Ebe, a technician
at Krupp's plant. A few weeks later, the axe fell on Rheinhausen.
Last night, Rheinhausen inhabitants turned off their domestic lights in a
show of support for the steel workers. Tonight, steel workers from
throughout the Ruhr region plan to begin a three-day march to Bonn.
But with the recession hitting the region hard, protests seem little more
than symbolic. Rheinhausen, which is home to the steel plants of both Krupp
and Thyssen, Germany's largest steel maker, has an unemployment rate edging
12 per cent.
The closure of the Krupp plant in Rheinhausen will put an additional 2,300
workers out of a job and affect 2,000 more who depend on the steel business.
Thyssen plans to put off 8,000 workers, mostly in its steel divisions, by
the end of 1994.
With all plants trimming overcapacity, workers have instead turned their
anger at Brussels. 'How can you explain to us that we are closing down when
Italian and Spanish steel producers receive massive subsidies?' says Mr
Klaus Liebman from the workers' council in Rheinhausen.
Driving the bollard in the fresh spring soil, Mr Hock says he will not give
up completely, however. 'We have to show Dusseldorf, Bonn and Brussels they
can't tell us what to do,' he goes on. 'Tell them once more before we start
working in McDonald's'
'Or in hell,' adds Dieter Biesgen, the porter at Gate 2, who has been with
Krupp for 37 years. 'It looks like only the blast furnaces there need
additional steel workers.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Debt deal likely to be at core of aid for Russia: Clinton
aims to outline proposed G7 package at Vancouver summit meeting with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEBT rescheduling deal worth about Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) is likely
to be the main plank of an aid programme for Russia to be discussed by the
Group of Seven leading industrialised countries.
President Bill Clinton aims to announce the broad lines of the aid plan at
his summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4.
It will then be discussed at an emergency meeting of G7 foreign and finance
ministers expected to be held later in April before being finalised at the
July G7 summit in Tokyo.
Western efforts to complete an aid package have if anything been speeded by
Mr Yeltsin's announcement on Saturday that he would rule by decree until a
referendum on April 25. Japanese officials involved in preparing the
ministerial meeting say a multilateral aid programme for Russia for this
year is almost certain to reach more than Dollars 30bn and may be as high as
Dollars 40bn.
The package is expected to include debt rescheduling likely to rise more
than sevenfold from the Dollars 2.5bn deferral agreed last year (although
Russia had much greater de facto debt relief in 1992 as a result of failure
to keep up with service payments). It may also contain funds for monetary
stabilisation and special assistance for small business and the energy
sector.
However, Japanese officials say there are unlikely to be more large pledges
of bilateral aid at the April meeting, from Japan or any other country,
given G7 fiscal and political problems. They say the package to be discussed
at the April meeting is likely to include:
Relief worth about Dollars 16bn from the interest and principal on the
Dollars 80bn foreign debt which Russia inherited from the Soviet Union.
Aid worth about Dollars 12bn. This would be a continuation of the G7 Dollars
24bn programme agreed last year, when only about Dollars 13.3bn was
disbursed, mainly in bilateral credits.
A monetary stabilisation fund worth about Dollars 3bn administered by the
International Monetary Fund.
Micro-economic measures which could provide proof of the value of western
aid and economic reform. These include boosting investment in small and
medium-sized businesses, developing the energy sector, decommissioning
nuclear power plants and converting military factories to civilian
production.
Western countries continued yesterday to support Mr Yeltsin in his
confrontation with the Russian parliament.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, yesterday said: 'We are
still standing behind Yeltsin. He is the best hope for reform in that
country.'
She added that President Clinton had no current plans to change the venue of
his summit with Mr Yeltsin, but would consider moving the meeting to Moscow
if the Russian leader suggested it.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, sent a strong personal message of
support to Mr Yeltsin. He underlined that there was 'very wide support for
the (Russian) reform process throughout this country and in Europe'.
He added: 'I strongly support the emphasis you give in your address to
controlling inflation, completing land reform and helping small and
medium-sized businesses. These are all areas in which we and our partners
have compared experience with you and have offered co-operation and
assistance.'
Britain is convinced assistance for Russia can be delivered most effectively
at the micro-economic level, for example, by support for small businesses or
financial services.
Officials said Britain was not interested in grandiose schemes that would
lead to money being poured down 'a bottomless pit'.
Britain is therefore prepared to build on existing programmes such as the
Pounds 100m know-how fund for the former Soviet republics; the 'chancellor's
scheme', devised by Mr Norman Lamont, to place Russian personnel with
companies in the UK financial sector and the various technical assistance
schemes organised by the European Community in which the UK participates.
Treasury officials said Britain supported a rescheduling of Russia's foreign
debt on terms that were as liberal as possible. However, Britain is not one
of Russia's biggest creditors and officials acknowledged that UK views might
not be shared by other G7 countries, notably Germany.
Officials from Russia's creditor governments are due to discuss its arrears
at a meeting of the Paris Club this week. This may show how far Russia can
look forward to an easing of its debt burden.
Any Paris Club deal, however, is still held up by the failure of Russia and
Ukraine to reach agreement on how to divide responsibility for the debt of
the further Soviet Union. US officials yesterday urged Mr Victor Pynzenyk,
Ukraine's economics minister, to settle this problem. At the big
international financial institutions in Washington, Mr Yeltsin's move
appears to have caused little immediate change in policy.
The World Bank signed a new Dollars 90m loan agreement with Russia on Friday
to help privatisation efforts, but the funds are not likely to be disbursed
for several weeks in any case.
The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is still a long way from
agreement with Russia on the kind of stabilisation programme that could lead
to substantial financing under the Fund's normal terms.
Both institutions have been asked by the G7 to work on a list of
'deliverable and visible initiatives' to clear the way for concrete
international aid to Russia. The Bank has been asked to work particularly on
efforts to restructure and privatise Russian companies and on a social
safety net to ease the transition to a market economy. IMF staff are looking
at ways of expanding the pool of money available to help Russia, such as the
General Arrangements to Borrow, whereby the Fund raises money from 10
industrial countries.
Meanwhile, some influential voices in Washington are urging the US
administration to concentrate, until Russia's political future looks
clearer, on humanitarian aid. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a leading
advocate in Congress of aid for Russia, called for the US to focus on
initiatives such as supplying disposable needles for an inoculation
programme, or diverting money from the Nato infrastructure fund to help
build housing for the armed forces that have had to be moved back to Russia
from the other former Soviet republics and from former Soviet satellite
states in eastern Europe.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Red tape deters foreign investors
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S Ilyushin aircraft design bureau, together with US engine makers and
avionics companies, is preparing to unveil a US-Russian airliner at the end
of this month. In the centre of Moscow, a cinema 'hijacked' by its Russian
workforce two years ago has yet to be returned to the French investors who
refurbished it.
Between these two extremes of success and failure, foreign investment in
Russia has lagged sharply behind the opportunities suggested by the
country's enormous natural wealth and unsatisfied demands for consumer goods
and services.
The failure of foreign investment to materialise on any significant scale -
just over Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m) last year, according to a government
official - has been largely Russia's fault. But President Boris Yeltsin's
showdown with the Russian parliament may help change the picture, even if it
promises to create even greater political instability in the near future.
'This instability is better than the status quo because it might lead to
some more permanent improvement,' says one western commercial counsellor.
The 'elementary order' Mr Yeltsin has promised to restore in Russia if he
wins a popular vote of confidence on April 25 is the most basic requirement
of foreign companies discouraged by red tape, corruption, and political
instability.
Apart from asking the country whether it wants a strong presidency and
private land ownership, Mr Yeltsin also mobilised western governments into
focusing on ways in which they can help revive the floundering Russian
economy. One part of the answer is to step up official encouragement for
western companies to invest in Russia and provide badly-needed capital
investment and management skills.
Mr Alexander Shokin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations,
complained last week that foreign investment so far was minimal compared
with Russia's needs and with the political stakes for the west in the
success of Russian economic reform. He said the government was creating a
database to help provide foreign companies with information on
opportunities, while both his Agency for Foreign Economic Co-operation and a
new Russian state corporation to insure investment risk were also available.
But behind the new schemes, the obstacles are very elementary indeed. Some
of it is basic law enforcement. In the case of the French cinema, a court
order was served in January for the labour collective - still a powerful
institution in Russia after 70 years of socialism - to reopen the business
to France's UGC cinema group.
But Mr Marc Ruscart, commercial director for the Russian-French joint
venture when it operated the cinema, says he is still waiting to see if it
will ever be enforced.
Much red tape could be abolished fairly quickly. For instance, even
representative offices of western banks in Moscow have to file reports twice
a year to the central bank on details ranging from their customers to what
cars they drive.
Other problems are due to conflicting government regulations and frequent
changes in taxation.
But Mr Genrikh Novozhilov, head of the Ilyushin design bureau, argues that
his joint project with US aero-engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney proves that
foreign investment is possible in key sectors like aerospace.
But looking at the much more active participation of foreign companies in
neighbouring China, some Russians believe Mr Yeltsin's promise to restore
order can only succeed if it leads to a dictatorship, for instance to stop
squabbling between central and local authorities.
'You in the west have already forgiven the Chinese for Tiananmen Square,'
says one official. 'Dictatorship is bad but it must be accepted as a
necessary evil to switch to a market economy.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Hopes dim for Bosnia peace accord

PROSPECTS for peace in Bosnia receded further yesterday. 'The feeling is
that time is running out on these (New York peace) talks,' said Mr Fred
Eckhard, the conference spokesman, in an unusually pessimistic statement.
'There is a question as to how many more days they can keep a negotiating
process going that seems to be getting nowhere.'
At the same time, the United Nations Security Council put off adoption of a
resolution enforcing a ban on flights over Bosnia, if necessary by shooting
down offending aircraft. The council had been due to vote last night but
agreed to a delay at the request of the Russians.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has intimated that he might
break off the peace talks if the ban is enforced.
An enforcement vote by the Security Council would be the first time that the
UN has authorised military intervention against one of the parties in the
Bosnian conflict, namely the Bosnian Serbs.
The Council was due to act after bombing raids last week by aircraft
believed to be Serbian on mainly Moslem villages in Bosnia. But the
resolution will not go into effect until the Council, the enforcing
countries and the UN peacekeeping forces agree on a date. A grace period of
two to three weeks may be given to the Serbs before the resolution is
implemented.
The Bosnian Serbs have largely respected the original ban, adopted last
November, at least as far as fixed wing combat aircraft are concerned.
However, they have continued to fly helicopters to transport personnel, the
wounded and war supplies. Last week's bombing is reported to have been
carried out by crop-sprayers.
In Sarajevo, UN officers said that General Philippe Morillon, the UN
military commander who last Friday led the first relief convoy into the
besieged town of Srebrenica since the Bosnian civil war began last April,
had struck a deal to evacuate Serbs from the Moslem-dominated town of Tuzla.
Mr Karadzic was quoted as having ordered his forces to open an air corridor
for UN helicopters.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Threat of unrest hits European equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices on European stock markets fell sharply yesterday amid concern
that President Boris Yeltsin's imposition of direct rule threatened Russia
with civil unrest.
The political showdown in Moscow also helped to weaken the D-Mark, after
several days in which the German currency had rallied strongly against the
dollar and most European currencies.
Dealers yesterday sold D-Marks for other currencies because of concerns
about the high level of German economic involvement with the former Soviet
Union.
The crisis gave a respite to the French franc which had weakened sharply
against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism last week.
UK equities, which had taken a generally negative view of last week's UK
Budget, moved lower in response to events in Moscow. The FT-SE 100 Index of
leading shares closed down 36.2 on the day at 2,863.9.
In Frankfurt, German shares fell even more sharply, with the DAX index
slipping 37.41 to close at 1,661.40. Construction stocks were particularly
badly hit on fears that Mr Yeltsin's problems could threaten contracts with
German companies to build flats for Russian soldiers returning home from
east Germany.
In Paris, the CAC-40 index lost 23.4 to close at 1,939.28, as fears over
Russia offset any comfort from the strong performance of the right in the
first round of the national assembly elections.
The US market fell in morning trade, but a rally in bonds brought shares off
their lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.1 down at 3,463.48.
The dollar rose to DM1.6473 in the morning, but closed at DM1.6375, up
nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day. It eased slightly to DM1.63725 in New
York. The French franc closed in London at FFr3.40 to the D-Mark from
FFr3.41 previously, and stayed close to this level in New York.

FT  23 MAR 93 / French alliance parties vie for influence in government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S two conservative alliance parties yesterday opened tense
negotiations over the share-out of seats for the second round of the general
election next Sunday - a foretaste of the rivalries likely in the powerful
new government.
The outcome of the bargaining between the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF
parties will decide which could provide France's next prime minister,
traditionally chosen by the president from the party with most seats. This
will also influence the distribution of top cabinet jobs.
If last weekend's first round of voting is confirmed in the final poll, the
new administration will gain a near-record parliamentary majority, with well
over three quarters of the seats in the 577-member national assembly,
After the first round, the Union pour la France (UPF) alliance of RPR and
UDF won nearly 39.5 per cent of the vote. The Gaullists were slightly more
than 1 percentage point ahead of their partners, while the ruling Socialists
polled a humiliating 17.6 per cent. The first round gives the coalition 78
seats outright, 42 for the RPR and 36 for the UDF, while the Socialists
failed to win a single seat.
Under their pre-election pact, the alliance agreed to field a joint
candidate in all but 70 seats, where the best-placed of the UDF and RPR
runners would go through to the second round. Yet the UDF appeared unhappy
with the fact that RPR candidates had done best in 52 of the contested
seats, indicating that the centre-right, leading in only 18 of the 70
UDF-RPR contests, could end up as the junior coalition partner.
The pair were at loggerheads yesterday, with the RPR advocating a single
candidate in all constituencies and the UDF calling for a run-off between
the two conservative candidates in constituencies where there was no chance
of a Socialist winning.
Several Socialist heavyweights will be fighting to save their seats next
weekend. They include Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister, Mr Raymond
Dumas, foreign minister, and Mr Michel Delebarre, civil service minister.
The French right does appear to have assuaged earlier market fears that it
will be less rigorous in its support for the franc than the outgoing
socialists.
However, Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon
Brothers, said the franc would remain vulnerable until the future prime
minister and finance minister had given a clear indication on policy.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Whitehall faces paying half cost of Channel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to have to meet as much as half the Pounds 2.5bn
cost of building the planned Channel tunnel rail link if it is to go forward
as a joint venture with the private sector, it emerged yesterday.
Such a large funding gap will severely test its commitment to the project
and raises questions about how quickly it will be built. The figures emerged
as Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, confirmed the widely-leaked route
of the railway and set in motion a six-month process in which the public
will be consulted over local detail.
Mr MacGregor said the consultation would be followed by legislation enabling
the project to go ahead. 'Provided that we press ahead quickly, it should be
possible for the railway to be completed around the end of the century,' he
said.
Mr MacGregor also confirmed that the project was to be funded jointly by the
public and private sectors and said the government would be prepared to
offer 'substantial' public sector support for construction. However, he
refused to say how much the government was prepared to contribute or when
the money would be paid.
In the Commons, Mr MacGregor was pressed by some Tory MPs about how the
decision to involve public support in the project squared with the
legislation passed in 1987 banning the use of public money for it.
Mr MacGregor insisted it was justified because the project would bring
domestic benefits, especially to commuters in Kent. Originally the
government had been adamant that the whole route had to be financed by the
private sector.
Documents released yesterday by Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary
in charge of the project, show that the scheme as proposed would produce a
financial return of only 4 per cent, much less than the 12 1/2 per cent
figure suggested by the transport department as the minimum level acceptable
to the private sector.
The documents, however, show how the gap could be filled by government
grants to reflect the social benefits of improved train services,
particularly commuter services, and the regeneration of the east Thames
corridor. It values these at up to Pounds 1.6bn.
The transport department, Union Railways and Samuel Montagu, the
government's merchant bank adviser on the project, are now to start
discussions with the private sector about proceeding with the link as a
joint venture.
There are fears in some parts of Whitehall, however, that in committing
itself so firmly - both yesterday and in the Budget - to the project, the
government has left itself vulnerable in its negotiations with the private
sector about financing the link.
Other points emerging from the announcement were:
The rail link scheme will be taken forward by Union Railways which will
become a government-owned company separate from BR in the autumn. At least
half the line's capacity will be taken up by commuter trains, cutting
journey times between London and Kent.
The line will carry little or no freight. The government has put up Pounds
30m to start work on an international station at Ashford, Kent; but the
planned international station at Stratford, east London, has been downgraded
to a possible option.
BR will only choose the site of the London terminal after further studies.
In a separate development the transport department announced that the M2
will be widened between junctions 1 and 3 to four lanes each way and between
junctions 3 and 4 to three lanes each way.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Russia split on Yeltsin support: President gives guarantee
of media freedom - US pledges backing for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S republics and regions were last night split more or less equally
over support for Mr Boris Yeltsin in his attempt to hold a popular vote on
his presidency and a new constitution.
The mixed reaction in the regions - that belied expectations of widespread
rejection of his action in outlying areas - filtered in to Moscow as the
Constitutional Court adjourned its crucial review of Mr Yeltsin's move
without an immediate decision.
Reflecting western support for Mr Yeltsin, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary
of state, said the US must help reform in Russia 'not as a matter of charity
but as a strategic concern of the highest order'.
He said Mr Yeltsin was committed to reform in its broadest sense, including
protection of civil liberties. But Mr Christopher stressed that US
assistance would not be 'cheap' and must be 'for the duration', vested in
reformers 'whether they are up or whether they are down'.
The response in Russia's outlying regions is vital for Mr Yeltsin as they
could interfere with his proposal to hold a popular vote on April 25 on
whether Russia should be ruled by the president or by the parliament that is
largely hostile to him and his pro-market reforms.
While the reaction was encouraging for him, it raised the danger of a deeply
divided nation, with rising tension between regions as the power struggle in
Moscow intensifies.
Mr Yeltsin moved to forestall expected attempts by parliament to declare
control over the media, by announcing he would guarantee the freedom of all
TV and radio stations and newspapers. Most national papers are already
sympathetic to him and the two main state channels are headed by his
appointees.
Mr Yeltsin got further strong support from Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister, who highlighted the desperate nature of the Russian economy as the
decisive factor in the president's decision to rule by decree until the
popular vote was held.
But Mr Yeltsin suffered a blow when Mr Nikolai Fyodorov, the justice
minister, resigned - the first minister to make clear his lack of support
for the president.
The Constitutional Court deliberated for hours but failed to rule on the
constitutionality of Mr Yeltsin's move. The court's chairman, Mr Valery
Zorkin, said deliberations would continue later this week.
Like parliament, the 13-member court is dominated by conservatives. But the
delay pointed to a troubled debate on a ruling that might lead to steps in
parliament to impeach Mr Yeltsin. Pointing to one of the court's problems,
Mr Zorkin said it had not received any documents requested from Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, earlier dismissed the
court as biased because of Mr Zorkin's declaration on Sunday that the
president was in breach of the constit-ution.
In London, Mr John Major sent a message of support to Mr Yeltsin. 'Russia
needs effective democratic government respecting the rule of law. That is
what we support and what you are seeking to achieve,' the prime minister
said.
Mr Major added that over the past two weeks the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries 'has been working on ideas for further economic
support'.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Hungry American eyes European sales: A look at EDS and its
plans to expand internationally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of Electronic Data Systems, America's largest
computing services company, sits in his office in Dallas, Texas, and casts a
hungry eye over Europe. 'For this decade', he says, 'it is really the
(international) marketplace.'
Europe, he explains, is just warming to the idea of outsourcing - whereby
companies spin off their computer systems management to an outside
specialist such as EDS - and is roughly where the US market was five years
ago. Asia-Pacific is some way behind Europe.
EDS, which now operates in more than 30 countries, has huge global
ambitions. It already earns 25 per cent of its revenues in international
markets, up from 14 per cent five years ago, and demonstrated its commitment
to rapid European expansion with its 1991 takeover of SD-Scicon, the UK
computer software and services business. Company officials hint that an
Italian acquisition may be on the cards.
But financial markets have been most excited in recent months by rumours
that it is in the early stages of negotiations with British Telecom which
could lead to joint ventures. It may even mean BT taking a stake in EDS,
which is a largely autonomous subsidiary of financially troubled General
Motors.
'Yes, we're talking to BT. . .', says Mr Alberthal, but then he quickly adds
'. . . and NTT (of Japan), and the French, and the Germans, and the Spanish
. . . and every other telephone company out there.'
This is hardly surprising, as telecommunications and computer businesses are
increasingly being pushed towards each other as the two industries converge
and corporate customers seek easy solutions to the problems of moving data
around the world.
EDS, for example, now operates what it claims is the world's largest
privately-owned digital information network, with its nerve centre at an
impressive control room in Plano, Texas, and 18 large information processing
centres around the world.
Some 90 per cent of its transmission capacity is leased from
telecommunications companies, which are in turn muscling into the computer
services business. BT, for example, is doing so in the UK, and has set up a
company in the US, called Syncordia, which aims to handle multi-nationals'
global communications traffic.
Combine Syncordia's slow US start-up with EDS's European ambitions (but a
lingering reputation there for Texan heavy-handedness) and it is hardly
surprising that many analysts see plenty of logic in a BT-EDS link-up.
However, Mr Alberthal, who will not comment directly on the BT rumours,
cautions that the media tends to be too eager to link EDS with a single
partner. 'But BT isn't all over the world; AT&amp;T (of the US) isn't all over
the world. There is no one answer.' In five years' time, he adds, he hopes
to have built a number of relationships.
Whatever the outcome, there is no doubting the success of EDS in the 30
years since it was founded by Mr Ross Perot - who last year ran as a
populist US presidential candidate - to help companies develop and integrate
computer systems and to manage systems for those businesses wishing to
outsource.
Mr Perot sold EDS to GM for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.83bn) in 1984 and parted
company with both businesses two years later after a succession of clashes
with fellow members of the car company's board. He now runs a smaller rival
to EDS, Perot Systems.
In spite of his departure, EDS has continued to grow strongly under the
owlish-faced Mr Alberthal, with revenues rising from Dollars 4.8bn in 1988
to Dollars 8.2bn in 1992; earnings per share increasing from 79 cents to
Dollars 1.33; and its backlog of non-GM business up from Dollars 12.7bn to
around Dollars 25bn.
Equally important, the mix of business has changed markedly. Work for GM,
which accounts for a relatively stable Dollars 3bn of EDS's revenues,
represented three quarters of total revenues in the mid-1980s. Last year,
however, GM contributed only 41 per cent and analysts expect the figure to
drop to little more than a quarter by the middle of the decade.
Mr Alberthal has also softened the hard-charging, marine-like and secretive
culture fostered by Mr Perot, while maintaining positive elements of the
Perot regime such as a strong group loyalty and single-minded focus on
getting a job done.
'The old EDS had a 'prolonged adolescence',' admits Mr Barry Sullivan,
vice-president in charge of marketing. 'It had this arrogant, 'we can take
on the world' point of view. It gave us a very rocky entry to the UK.'
However, company officials from the chairman down insist this lingering
image is outdated and EDS has become much more sensitive to local cultures.
They point out, for example, that 10 years ago it employed 300 people
outside the US, of which 290 were Americans, while now it employs 17,000, of
which only 100 are Americans.
With analysts forecasting rapid growth in information technology services
over the next decade, the group's prospects seem very bright, though not
without potential problems.
One of these is increasing competition as computer hardware manufacturers,
led by IBM, and telecommunications companies focus more attention on the
services business. EDS's strength in this tussle is its independence - it
has no vested interest in pushing a certain product at buyers - but
competition could nevertheless drive down the sector's margins.
Another potential problem is managing rapid growth to prevent the kind of
bureaucratic inertia and cultural dilution which can put the most successful
companies out of touch with customer needs.
EDS has grown from just 13,000 employees at the time of the GM takeover to
more than 70,000 today, and the numbers should keep mounting fast, as every
time EDS gets an outsourcing contract, it also acquires the computer staff
of the company concerned and has to steep them in EDS ways - a process it
calls 'transitioning'.
Mr Alberthal argues that this is a source of strength, rather than weakness,
as it brings fresh industrial expertise into the group. Moreover, EDS, with
30 years of 'transitioning' behind it, has much more experience in the
technique than many newer outsourcing rivals.
However, to maintain the entrepreneurial drive of a small company, Mr
Alberthal fundamentally shook up EDS's management structure four years ago,
dividing the group into 38 strategic business units, each responsible for
their own profits.
Last autumn he tweaked the structure again to make it flatter, encourage
more teamwork across the group and foster the 'cultural diversity' which he
says is 'essential to being a truly global company'.
The sentiment reflects both the distance the company has travelled from
Perotian uniformity and the way it still has to go to realise fully its
international ambitions.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Unilever responds to ACT change by lifting final payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer group, yesterday became the
second company to propose an increased dividend to compensate investors for
changes announced last week in the chancellor's budget.
Unilever said it would recommend at its annual meeting next month that UK
shareholders' final dividend for 1992 be lifted from a previously announced
15.6p to 16.13p.
The increase would ensure shareholders who do not pay tax will not lose out
because of lower rates of advanced corporation tax. The increase will have
the effect of maintaining the gross dividend at 20.8p.
The increase was prompted by an equalisation agreement in place between
Unilever plc of the UK and Unilever NV of the Netherlands.
Under the agreement, the two companies' dividends are kept in line and ACT
in the UK is treated as part of the dividend.
The recommended final dividend for Unilever NV is unchanged at Fl 4.30.
Although Unilever is unusual because of its capital structure, its decision
to lift the payout will add to calls for other companies to follow suit.
This follows last week's move by Rentokil, the environmental services
company, which increased its final dividend because of the Budget changes.
Other cross-border joint ventures may also be affected.
Royal Dutch/Shell, the international oil company, refused to comment on its
dividend policy.
While it has a similar dividend distribution arrangement to Unilever, Royal
Dutch/Shell's ACT question would be overshadowed by other factors, such as
currency translation.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing merger which started trading on
January 1, is still considering the impact of the ACT changes on its
dividend policy.
Under the merger agreement, the two companies intend to recommend equivalent
gross dividends based on an equalisation ratio from October this year.

FT  23 MAR 93 / BAT plans to pay 33.9p scrip dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, plans to
pay a scrip dividend worth 50 per cent more than the 22.6p final cash
dividend announced recently.
The group does not intend to repeat the offer, worth 33.9p per share, for
future dividend payments. Shareholders who want cash can sell the new
ordinary shares through Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities for 32.2p, free of
dealing costs - a 5 per cent discount to cover the joint broker's risk in
underwriting the deal.
BAT has taken this step partly because its large overseas earnings give it a
big problem with unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. But the group denied
that this step was inspired by last week's Budget moves to deal with ACT.
Mr Amir Eilon, of BZW, said: 'We had been working on this for 18 months and
would have done it anyway if the Budget had not come along. The government
has in fact cut this short by promising to deal with unrelieved ACT.'
The scheme will need to be approved by a 75 per cent majority of
shareholders voting at BAT's annual meeting in May. City institutions do not
normally take scrip issues, but BZW said it was confident that most large
shareholders would approve the deal.
Other large companies might be tempted to follow BAT. To do so without
diluting earnings or net assets, they will need to have unrelieved ACT and
be confident that they can employ the money released at a sufficiently high
rate of return.
BAT could save up to Pounds 97m of ACT and up to Pounds 330m of dividends by
issuing the scrip, assuming full take-up. The group said its net asset value
could increase by as much as 6.2 per cent and earnings per share would be
enhanced. Gearing could fall from 54.6 per cent to as low as 41 per cent,
depending on take-up.
Sir Patrick Sheey, chairman, said: 'Shareholders will benefit from the
higher value and the group will benefit from being even better placed to
take advantage of the extensive opportunities for organic growth within our
existing businesses.'
BAT is investing heavily in cigarette factories at Southampton in the UK,
Georgia in the US, and in new technology for Farmers, the group's US
insurance subsidiary.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Row over Spring Ram audit emerges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, and its
auditors Arthur Andersen came into the open yesterday with Andersen saying
it had raised doubts about 1992 profit expectations 'at an early stage'.
Spring Ram has blamed accounting rule changes - applied to its figures late
in the day - for 1992 pre-tax profits falling to Pounds 26.2m, one third
below the expected Pounds 39m and 28 per cent below 1991's Pounds 36.2m. The
figures were reached after much haggling with Arthur Andersen.
Spring Ram's share price halved last week on news of the impending
disappointment.
Andersen denied yesterday that it had told Spring Ram it could not support
the board's pre-tax profit figure only days before results were due. It had
made its reservations known early about analysts' expectations.
As discussions over the 1992 figures started in November, it is understood
general doubts were expressed before the end of the year. More specific
points came up as the figures emerged.
Main reasons for the shortfall were that Pounds 5.6m of profits were being
booked early on land sales and kitchen contracts, and that the group was
prevented from capitalising Pounds 4m of product development costs.
The audit was conducted amid criticism of Spring Ram's aggressive accounting
policies and weak financial controls. In November false accounting came to
light at the Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary.
In December, Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, and Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance
director, toured City institutions reassuring them that Balterley was a
'one-off' and about the 'reality' of the group's profits. 'It has not been
done by Mickey Mouse creative accounting,' said Mr Greenwood.
There is strong pressure on him to go. His position and that of Arthur
Andersen will be discussed by the board this week.
Mr Rooney has been criticised for effectively combining the roles of
chairman and chief executive. One of two non-executives the group plans to
appoint may take the role of chairman.
The share price closed at 75p yesterday, compared with a high last May of
181p.

FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spring Ram Corporation's forced conversion to the kitchen sink school of
auditing must count as a triumph for the rigorous new accounting regime. It
was always improbable that a company manufacturing kitchens and bathrooms
could have maintained pre-tax profit margins at around 20 per cent
throughout the recession. Its aggressive accounting policies now emerge as
one of the main reasons.
Last year's cleaned-up results emerged some Pounds 13m below what the market
had expected. Spring Ram blithely suggested this provided a solid new base
from which to progress. Its irrepressibly optimistic fan club sensed a
buying opportunity following the company's share price collapse.
This shows remarkable forgiveness for a company which has developed a nasty
habit of disappointment. There must be grave doubts about the quality of
Spring Ram's previously stated earnings. Its in-bred culture and the delay
in appointing non-executive directors continue to give grounds for concern.
Should shareholders be burned again they have nothing to blame but their own
myopia.

FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Baltica/Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baltica's announcement that it plans to bid for Hafnia looks like an attempt
to find a Danish solution to this troubled insurance affair. Since the
underlying insurance business of both companies is sound, a merger must be
tempting - especially given a restructuring plan that should isolate the
problems in Baltica's holding company.
The main losers from this latest twist in the saga appear to be investors in
Baltica Holding, including the French Groupe Victoire. The main gainers
would be bank lenders such as Den Danske Bank whose exposure to both
companies would be more secure. That begs the question, though, of who will
be rash enough to recapitalise Baltica so that it can take over Hafnia. If
this really is a local solution, Danish pension funds might stump up the
cash. But a lot of Scandinavian institutional money has already been wasted
on grandiose schemes in the financial sector.

FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Argos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Market research is no substitute for a good idea - as Argos's foray into
furniture demonstrates all too clearly. Chesterman was only a four-store
pilot venture, yet it managed to cost Argos Pounds 21m in its brief passage
from cradle to grave. The company argues that there was too big a gap
between the research being done and the stores opened. It seems more likely
that the management's good use of research in the main Argos chain - a
business it knows well - blinded it to ambiguous answers about a business it
did not know at all. The high exit cost also indicates that the management
had not seriously considered that the project might fail.
More happily, Argos is blessed with a flourishing core business. Floor space
will grow by around 6 per cent this year, and total sales may be up over 10
per cent. Calls for more rapid development are sensibly being resisted, and
the format still has several years of expansion, so earnings growth seems
assured. That, however, is amply reflected in Argos's premium rating. And
Chesterman has delivered a nasty knock to the management's reputation. The
market's relief that Argos has decided against moving into Europe is
evidence enough of that.

FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: World equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's weakness in US and European equities bore faint echoes of August
1991 when markets plunged following the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.
Now as then there must be doubt whether events in a country with Russia's
negligible share in world trade have real meaning for equity markets.
Western governments may step up aid payments, but surely not enough to
influence interest rates. Similarly their budgets are unlikely to come under
pressure from higher defence spending when Russia's main danger is to
itself. That leaves only vague worries about refugees and disrupted
commodity supplies.
Then again, there are some differences with 1991. The coup attempt came as a
real surprise, forcing markets down sharply. Yesterday's equity falls were
more restrained, while the dollar's limited rise suggests the foreign
exchange market is less perturbed. The Russian crisis may have been more an
excuse for equity market correction than its cause. P/e ratios on both sides
of the Atlantic look stretched, while in some countries, like Germany, the
recent run-up in prices has left equity yields unattractive next to bonds.
If these are the real worries, equities may not recover as quickly as in
1991 - but neither probably will the situation in Moscow.

FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BAT's paper solution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries offer of an enhanced scrip dividend has been made in spite
of, rather than because of, last week's Budget. The lower rate of Advance
Corporation Tax promised by the chancellor should if anything encourage a
company with predominantly overseas earnings to reward shareholders with
cash. Even so, the proposed scrip might save BAT Pounds 100m unrelieved ACT
this year. What is, in effect, a small rights issue should not then dilute
earnings per share. Together with a solemn promise not to repeat the
exercise, that may overcome the markets' suspicion of companies which prefer
to print shares than fork out hard cash.
BAT must still convince it can earn a decent return on the money that will
be saved if all shareholders elect to take the scrip. Its case is helped by
the fast growth of the tobacco and US insurance businesses. Net debt is
expected to fall even if the scrip is shunned. Other companies which might
be planning similar arrangements simply to avoid paying ACT or prop up weak
cash flow deserve to be sent away with a thick ear.
The whole exercise underlines the unfortunate side-effects of the ACT
system. One can only hope the chancellor's proposed foreign income dividends
survive beyond the consultation paper and result in a more sensible
solution. Common sense dictates dividends should be set according to
companies' resources and the rate of return on alternative investments.
Setting dividend policy by every new twist of taxation is putting the cart
before the horse.

FT  23 MAR 93 / US puts increased pressure on Japan over economy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government has sharply increased pressure on Japan over the contents
and the scale of plans to boost its flagging economy with an emergency
public spending package to be announced within the next few weeks.
The US probing of the Japanese plans suggests the Clinton administration
will take an increasingly assertive stance, not just on trade but on
macro-economic policy.
Senior US officials led by Professor Larry Summers, who has been nominated
to oversee the US approach to international economic policies, have sent the
Japanese finance ministry a long stream of questions about the details of
the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency package introduced last year.
The questions are thought to reflect scepticism among some of President Bill
Clinton's senior economic advisers over the real extent of the stimulus
which the special package delivered.
While Japan presented the package as worth about 2.3 per cent of gross
national product, the US administration estimates it may be worth less than
1 per cent.
The US probing comes as Japan is in the delicate process of drawing up plans
for a further emergency package, which some politicians have suggested may
be worth as much as Y14,000bn.
Prof Summers' questioning is complicating the task of drawing up the
package, which Japanese leaders want to be ready for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, to present to Mr Clinton during talks in Washington on April
16.
The US has repeatedly called on Japan to stimulate its slowing economy to
raise demand for imports, in order to reduce its ballooning trade surplus
with the US and help sustain the role of exports in the US economic
recovery.
Until recently the US pressure was mainly confined to the size of the
Japanese fiscal programme. In the past few weeks more attention has focused
on its contents as well suggesting that the US administration may not take
it at face value.
Japanese officials say the US has expressed scepticism about the value of
increased spending through the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, Japan's
so-called second budget, which is largely funded by postal savings.
More than Y4,000bn of the Y10,700bn package was funded by drawing funds from
the programme. However, the US suggests much of this spending is simply
redirected rather than new money.
The US and Japan also differ over Japan's room for manoeuvre on fiscal
policy. The US believes Japan's public finances allow considerable room for
fiscal stimulus through cutting taxes, higher spending and increased
borrowing. The Japanese finance ministry insists much of its apparent
surplus is already committed to pensions for the country's rapidly ageing
population.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With little more than a month to go before Jacques Attali hosts the 1993
annual meeting of his European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in
London, Observer hears that the directors are already battling over where to
hold their 1994 bash.
Normally these sorts of event would have been sorted out some time ago, but
the choice of next year's site has been delayed by behind-the-scenes
bickering. Bulgaria thinks it should play host since it invited the bank to
Sofia, its capital, as long ago as last April. However, Russia's St
Petersburg has also thrown its name into the pot.
Attali, who is spending an inordinate amount of time worrying about Russia
these days, is reported to be keen on St Petersburg, whereas some of his
fellow directors feel that since Sofia asked first, it should get the
meeting.
However, the dispute is not just about directors' egos. Sofia may have a
wonderful conference hall, but the lights frequently go out. By the same
token, St Petersburg's infrastructure is not on a par with that of Budapest
which hosted the first meeting. If St Petersburg gets the go-ahead, then it
will be a sure sign that Attali's personal power remains undimmed.

It's Marx out and Spencer in for China's top bureaucrats when they pop back
to the Communist party school at the People's University of China in Beijing
for a refresher course. According to the Times Higher Educational
Supplement, the party school is sprucing up its programmes to meet the needs
of a 'socialist market economy'.
So out go 17 specialisms, including scientific socialism, the science of
national economic planning, the international communist movement and marxist
ethics. In come 14 new courses such as marketing, human resources
management, real estate, international trade, taxation and international
business management.
Required reading among high-level government officials and economists will
soon be Tom Peters and Peter Drucker, rather than Marx or Mao, as
dialectical materialism gives way to double entry bookkeeping.

Forget about cross-functional collaboration, corporate coherence and all

down-to-earth way of uniting his staff.
'Love,' he writes in the foreword to the hospital's draft application for
NHS trust status, 'is not a popular word to use in the work world these
days. Some perhaps confuse the presence of love with an absence of
management acumen. I know the two co-exist, because they are here together
at the King's Mill Hospital.'
And he goes on: 'We propose to frame the love and commitment of our staff in
the disciplines and freedoms of NHS trust status for the benefit of
Ashfield, Mansfield and our wider community.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: Thinker on the trigger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Workers of the world unite' has given way to putting thinkers of the world
on screen for 1960s student revolutionary Tariq Ali. His latest project is a
series of films about philosophers.
The first, on Wittgenstein, is for release this week. A second in the can is
on Spinoza. Another, on Locke, is scheduled for filming this autumn.
'I'm hoping Jonathan Miller will play him,' says Ali, adding that while
presenting his subjects' ideas, he isn't doing it classroom-style. 'The idea
is to explain their philosophies through the way they lived their lives.'
Hence, a good candidate for a fourth film would surely be Oxford's F H
Bradley who died in 1924. True, in Britain he was rarely seen outside Merton
College where he lived as a bachelor, but he often took health-restoring
trips abroad where he had some intriguing adventures.
One was to link up with a red-headed writer called Elinor Glyn who
scandalised Edwardian society with her novel Three Weeks about a steamy
affair in exotic settings. The result was a popular jingle:
Would you like to sin
with Elinor Glyn
on a tiger skin?
Or would you prefer
to err with her
on some other fur?
Whether she did any sinning with Bradley is uncertain. While the fact that
he was 65 when they met makes it less likely, his writings show he doubted
that he could have a Platonic relationship with a woman.
What he certainly had, however, was a fierce hatred of cats which, when
feasible, he shot at with a revolver. Nor evidently did he see them as his
only potential enemies, because he never went abroad without carrying one of
the three pistols that were found in his college room on his death, none of
them registered with the police.
All of which sheds odd light on Bradley's brand of philosophy. He was an
idealist.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Right man, wrong job: Germany needs Hans Tietmeyer in Bonn,
not at the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, is favourite to take over
at the top of the German central bank when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
president, retires at the end of September.
There is a chance, however, he will find himself in the wrong job.
Mr Tietmeyer, 61, a former state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry, who
joined the Bundesbank in 1990, would make a good central bank president. He
is a formidable negotiator who combines wide knowledge of financial affairs
with great powers of persuasion in public and private.
The real gaps in the running of the German economy are, however, not in
Frankfurt, but in Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will ultimately decide the Bundesbank
succession, should put Mr Tietmeyer in supreme charge of tackling the
economic consequences of German reunification - by making Mr Tietmeyer
Germany's next finance minister.
The suggestion is controversial. Removing Mr Theo Waigel, the present
finance minister, who heads Mr Kohl's Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, would cause a coalition crisis. Additionally, Mr Tietmeyer
would be loath to consider the idea because he started his Bonn career as an
economics ministry official as long ago as 1962. He knows, first-hand, the
strains and frustrations of government life - pressures which have been
greatly increased by the problems of unification.
The president of a universally respected, statutorily independent central
bank enjoys a much more comfortable and predictable existence than the
finance minister. The job is secure - it carries an eight-year mandate.
And the Bundesbank boss earns around DM700,000 a year, well over double Mr
Waigel's salary.
For all this, there are compelling reasons why Mr Tietmeyer's talents would
be put to better use in Bonn than in Frankfurt.
First, Mr Tietmeyer's lack of mainstream political experience would be an
asset, not a liability, in view of German voters' disenchantment with the
established political parties.
Mr Tietmeyer, a member of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union since 1960,
certainly has the ear of the chancellor. He is not a member of the Bundestag
 -but then neither is Mr Klaus Kinkel, the current foreign minister, who
took over last year.
Second, Mr Tietmeyer's stamina and experience would give him crucial
advantages in negotiations on putting the financing of German unity on a
sounder footing. Mr Kohl's budget deal with the Social Democrats and the
Lander 10 days ago still leaves gaping holes in public-sector finances. This
means the search must go on for the right balance of spending cuts, tax
increases and new public financing methods, including privatisation. As a
technocrat of stature, Mr Tietmeyer would stand a good chance of remaining
in his post if - as seems possible - a grand coalition of Christian and
Social Democrats came to power during the next few years. Clearly, however,
an outright SPD victory in the December 1994 general elections would deprive
Mr Tietmeyer of a job. That is a risk he would have to take.
Third, Mr Tietmeyer has been called in before by Mr Kohl on sensitive
missions. In spring 1990, the chancellor made him head of the West German
delegation negotiating the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany.
Mr Tietmeyer has since admitted that, reflecting the need for a quick deal,
Bonn made important errors in its accord with the east Germans. These
concerned above all the terms on which east Germany's assets and liabilities
were converted into D-Marks.
These mistakes have had important economic policy consequences. As finance
minister, Mr Tietmeyer would have a chance to correct some of them.
Fourth, on the international stage, Mr Tietmeyer would be a more convincing
performer than Mr Waigel. Mr Tietmeyer has a better grasp of the issues at
the heart of the debate over European economic and monetary union.
If he made more strenuous efforts to correct imbalances in German fiscal
policies, Mr Tietmeyer would carry more conviction in pleading for patience
over the effects of these policies on Germany's partners.
Commonsense, then, indicates that Mr Tietmeyer would be an optimal choice.
But practical realities suggest that he is likely to stay in Frankfurt. That
would be a pity.
The Bundesbank often appears strongest when the government is weak. That is
not good for Germany's image. An imaginative decision to recall Mr Tietmeyer
to Bonn would help redress the balance.
Summoning into the government a man of his reputation and intellect would
emphasise the scale of the country's challenges. And it would improve the
chance that, within a relatively short span of years, Germany will come to
terms with them.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Why Europe's hands are tied: The Commission is taking a back
seat at a time of political and economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in the new year, Mr Jacques Delors chaired the first meeting of the
European Commission. Turning to his new team, he asked whether they were
content to follow their member states' instructions and lie low until
ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European Union.
The answer was a resounding yes. Mr Delors concurred, reluctantly. One week
later, he again asked whether it was wise for the Commission to take a back
seat. Once again, a clear majority favoured a low profile.
With hindsight, Mr Delors believes he made a mistake. At the very moment of
political and economic crisis in the European Community, the Commission has
forfeited its authority as arbiter between the 12 member states. A power
vacuum has arisen in the EC.
'We have been put in a (Trappist) monastery,' says one EC official. Another
senior EC official is blunter. He argues that the EC has degenerated into a
standing inter-governmental conference, led by a weak Danish presidency
which cannot see beyond May 18, the date of a second referendum on
Maastricht.
Europe appears doomed to play a waiting game which - bar upsets - may end
with final ratification in the UK in early autumn. Mr Delors, meanwhile, has
taken to travel: a leisurely trip to Morocco, and a tour of Latin America,
ending in a 55-minute meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Washington.
Yet the impression of inactivity may be misleading. Whatever the outcome in
Denmark and the UK, EC leaders face choices which will determine whether the
Community moves forward, stagnates, or slips into genteel decline.
The first challenge is trade. Hard-pressed companies are pushing for
protection from cheap imports from eastern Europe and high-technology
competition in Asia. The call for special treatment covers steel,
semiconductors, cereals, fish and many other recession-hit industries.
Protectionist pressures may subside after the French parliamentary
elections, the first round of which ended Sunday; but Brussels diplomats
predict that the new right-wing government in Paris would adopt an even
tougher line on trade than its Socialist predecessor. Their fear is that
France will demand a renegotiation of last year's EC-US farm trade accord,
dashing hopes for the Gatt Uruguay Round.
This is a troubling prospect, particularly in Bonn. The German government is
uneasy about being forced to choose between France as its natural EC ally
and its wider national interest in seeing an early Gatt deal. Last month, Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, warned: 'We have reached the point
where our conception no longer coincides with that of France.'
Mr Kinkel's comments reflect a reassessment of EC trade policy in Bonn.
Germany remains furious that it lost the 'banana' war. Having fought to
preserve its supply of high-quality 'dollar' bananas from Latin America,
Germany was forced to accept an EC-wide quota which guaranteed supply from
Caribbean producers, many from former French and British colonies.
Diplomats detect a new German assertiveness in favour of open markets. Bonn
has resisted French-led efforts to strengthen trade weapons such as
anti-dumping duties. It has also ignored pressure to impose curbs on cheap
imports from China and North Korea. 'Trade policy is completely blocked in
the EC,' says a former EC commissioner.
The second challenge for the EC is how to stimulate economic growth. Last
week's  1/2 percentage point reduction in the Bundesbank's discount rate is
welcome; but the Commission argues that German rates must fall much further
and faster if the EC is to beat its already optimistic forecast of 0.8 per
cent growth in 1993. The target of 3 per cent growth looks even more remote.
Yet at least 2.5 per cent growth is necessary to prevent a further rise in
unemployment, according to a new European Parliament study. Low growth means
longer dole queues. The EC economy expanded by just over 1 per cent in 1992,
but unemployment rose by 2m. This year, the number of people out of work in
the EC could top 17m.
The response is an EC 'growth package'. The idea is that member states
co-ordinate capital spending projects on roads, housing and infrastructure
to kick-start their economies. But the real test is whether the 12 can put
on a convincing show of solidarity to coax the US and Japan to support
expansionary fiscal measures at the Tokyo economic summit in July.
Without economic growth, there is no prospect of the EC meeting its third
challenge: adequate 'convergence' in economic performance to proceed to a
European monetary union in 1997, leading eventually to a single European
currency.
The economic downturn, compounded by high German interest rates, has shown
that EC economies are more likely to diverge in the near term. This
divergence lay behind the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism which forced
sterling and the Italian lira to float; the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese
escudo and the Irish punt have suffered forced devaluations, while the
French franc is far from safe.
Many EC officials argue the way to beat the speculators and salvage Emu is a
Franco-German initiative launching a 'fast track' to monetary union,
possibly through a fixing of franc/D-Mark exchange rates. 'There is nothing
in the Maastricht treaty which prohibits such a move,' says one.
A putative 'strong currency club' led by France and Germany would probably
include the Benelux countries. Others would be invited to follow, at their
own pace. EC officials add that such an initiative could be timed to
'relaunch' the EC immediately after Maastricht ratification.
Yet such talk finds little resonance in Bonn; even less so in Frankfurt,
home of the Bundesbank. Senior German officials rule out moving ahead of
schedule on Emu; their great fear is that weaker members will try to fudge
the 'convergence criteria' on curbing inflation and budget deficits, just to
secure the political triumph of a monetary union by 1997.
A senior Bonn official predicts that a majority of countries will not be
ready to meet the Maastricht criteria in 1996. Without mentioning whether
deficit-ridden Germany will be strictly eligible to join Emu, he declares:
'It's going to be 1999.'
The length of time reflects the need to work out how to meet Maastricht's
twin objectives of deepening the EC through monetary and political union,
while preparing to accommodate new members. Enlargement goes beyond the
current batch of EC aspirants - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - and
extends planning for a Community of up to 20 members.
Similar planning for institutional change is proceeding quietly in other
European capitals. Among the ideas are: more responsibilities to the
European Parliament, including voting on the membership of the Commission
and new, limited revenue-raising powers; stronger powers for the Commission
president, possibly by creating a troika of vice-presidents responsible for
the internal market, trade and political co-operation; and limits on the
number of languages used in the bureaucracy.
At present, some 10,000 EC meetings are interpreted in nine official
languages, requiring 72 combinations for interpreting purposes. The use of
16 languages would result in 240 combinations, requiring 54 interpreters for
one meeting of a single committee.
But no one wants to open the debate on institutional change. It might scare
voters in Denmark or enrage UK Euro-sceptics. It could also muddy the
picture in the Nordic countries, where popular support for Maastricht is
lukewarm.
A senior Belgian official says the present vacuum is surreal. 'The accession
negotiations are being conduced on the basis of a non-existent treaty, a
non-existent consensus among the applicants, by an EC presidency (Denmark)
whose country has not even ratified the treaty.'
Sooner or later all member states will have to make the tough choices on how
to pursue deepening integration while continuing to offer wider membership
of the club. On this fundamental question, the debate over the Maastricht
treaty has little or nothing to say.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Storms ahead in France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S conservative parties have won a spectacular victory in the first
ballot of the general election. If confirmed in the second ballot next
Sunday it will produce a national assembly reminiscent of the Chambre Bleu
Horizon of 1919, or even the Chambre Introuvable of 1815, both remembered as
high points of right-wing electoral backlash.
Yet the overwhelming parliamentary majority projected for the conservative
alliance reflects only a modest jump in their popular vote. The truly
spectacular event is the halving of the Socialist vote. This was
foreshadowed in local and regional elections a year ago, but then it could,
at a pinch, be interpreted as a mid-term protest vote. Certainly it was a
warning, to which President Francois Mitterrand responded by dismissing his
unpopular prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, replacing her with the
generally respected finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy. That response has
cut no ice.
Mr Beregovoy is still respected - by the markets, but in elections they do
not have the deciding voice. With the public at large his reputation has
been tainted - not so much by the personal peccadillo of an interest-free
loan from a businessman as by the fact that his party has been involved in
scandal after scandal, while the president himself is seen as well past his
sell-by date. Crime and immigration prey on the minds of many ordinary
voters, in France as elsewhere in western Europe. But none of these things
would cause such fierce and widespread resentment were it not for the state
of the economy. Growth has come to a stop. Bankruptcies are rising steeply.
So, above all, is unemployment.
Model of responsibility
This sounds like a familiar pattern. Left-wing governments traditionally
come unstuck on economics, and disillusioned electorates then turn to
conservatives, with sounder and more rigorous policies, to sort things out.
But that is not what has happened in France. The Socialist party sowed its
wild oats way back in 1981-83, and since then has been a model of fiscal and
monetary responsibility. France has one of the lowest rates of inflation on
the continent, and is running a trade surplus. While it is certainly
plausible to blame the current recession on the government's obsession with
sound money, especially its determination to hold the franc-mark parity at
all costs, this is in fact the one issue on which the main opposition
leaders decline to criticise it. Even if the voters' howl of pain was
directed primarily at this policy, the effect will be a government pledged
to continue it.
Poisoned chalice
Inevitably the markets will question how credible, and for how long, such a
pledge can be. Already voices within the victorious parties are calling for
devaluation, and the very size of the new government's majority will make it
harder to silence them. No doubt steps will be taken to reinforce the
pledge's credibility, though it seems unlikely that a further rise in
interest rates would have that effect. The Bundesbank will reiterate its
commitment, but this too may fail to carry conviction unless accompanied by
cuts in interest rates much more decisive than we have seen yet.
If the franc fort is one poisoned chalice for the incoming government,
another is the agreement on agricultural subsidies reached between the EC
and US last November, which French conservatives denounced with even greater
venom than the Socialist government, and pledged themselves rather more
convincingly to reject. In attempting to honour that pledge they will find
themselves at odds with Germany.
The potential for a serious Franco-German split, with all that that implies
for the EC's future cohesion, is obvious. Some elements within the
coalition, especially on its Gaullist wing, may be tempted to make a virtue
of such a split. Others, including Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of
the non-Gaullist wing, would strenuously oppose it, and would be supported
by the President.
His support may not count for much, at least initially. After such a defeat,
and with only two years of his second mandate left to run, he appears the
lamest of lame ducks. But on past form he will be quick to exploit the many
fault lines in the new governing majority - not least the fact that its
leaders will be rivals in their aspiration to succeed him.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Leading Article: After Taurus - City lessons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT lessons are there for the City in the collapse of the Taurus project?
Mr Peter Rawlins, who lost his job as chief executive of the London Stock
Exchange over the failure of the exchange's ambitious project of
computerising equity settlement, thinks the lessons are wide-ranging.
'To characterise it simply as a Stock Exchange failure, or as a failure just
of the technology, is to miss the point,' he said last week.
Mr Rawlins argues that the Taurus project became unmanageable because the
City failed to agree on a specification which could actually be built.
'There is a real City management problem here,' he said. 'It could happen
again.'
The point Mr Rawlins is making reflects a shift in the way the City works.
Once, it was dominated by the heads of powerful institutions - the Stock
Exchange, Lloyd's, the Accepting Houses Committee - who possessed enough
clout to get what they wanted.
Those days are gone. The old institutions have lost their influence. The
newly important bodies in the City - the Securities and Investments Board,
the Eurobond trade-association-cum-regulator, and so on - see their roles in
much more narrow terms.
Increasingly, there is only one 'communal' body left, its prestige tarnished
but its role if anything enhanced: the Bank of England. It is not surprising
that the Bank ended up picking up the pieces of Taurus; whenever the City
sneezes, these days, the Bank is asked to supply the handkerchief.
The Bank's approach - collegiate, calm, rational-men-together - has its
virtues. But it risks producing consensus at the price of something for
everyone. It was a Bank-sponsored committee, after all, which saddled the
City with the unbuildable Taurus blueprint.
Market competition
So far, so depressing. It would be easy for this debate to drift, like many
discussions in Britain, into a lament for past glories, and an elegy for a
time of giants.
Another way of looking at the issues involved, however, is to see them as
the inevitable result of the introduction of competition into London's
financial markets.
Economic theory teaches us that in a truly competitive market, with easy
access for new entrants, it is hard to reach agreement on sharing the costs
of projects which benefit everyone.
It is much easier, and much more rewarding, to be a 'free rider', coasting
along on the back of others' efforts, than to contribute oneself. To entice
free riders to contribute, they must be promised something for their
efforts, risking the creation of unmanageable projects like Taurus.
The City's difficulty in reaching agreement on shared projects is therefore
the mirror image of its progress in becoming a more competitive marketplace.
Settlement system
That may be a plausible explanation. It still leaves the London equity
market without a modern settlement system, however - and, perhaps, without
other desirable shared undertakings in future.
When a shared project is truly a common good, the state, with its powers of
taxation and coercion, is the only institution capable of overcoming the
free rider problem. Precisely because those powers are so great, however,
they must be used sparingly. A working legal system is certainly a public
good worthy of the state's attention; an equity settlement system may not
be.
Where does that leave desirable-but-not-essential projects? Answer: in
limbo, their outcome subject to chance, and the diplomacy of the project's
proponents.
If that seems unsatisfactory, consider the alternatives, neatly illustrated
by London's two principal rivals as European financial centres. In
Frankfurt, the club ethos still rules, but is fraying at the edges as
participants start to grapple with the harsh lessons of competitive
financial markets.
In Paris, the state eagerly ensures the provision of public goods - at the
risk of providing more than the market needs and stifling competition in the
process.
Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. London has chosen a
model in which, increasingly, competition rules. If that occasionally
results in a spectacular mess like the Taurus affair, so be it: capitalism
is a very messy process.

Sir, You report that NatWest is to impose swingeing penalties on those
customers who habitually become overdrawn ('NatWest to charge daily for
overdrawn accounts', March 20). This is the same institution which, when
many of those same customers were students, inculcated the habit by
encouraging unlimited overdrafts without warning or penalty, much to the
disgust of parents who had tried to develop responsible attitude to money.
Such a cynical and irresponsible policy deserves to lose it the custom it so
unworthily obtained by such methods.

FT  23 MAR 93 / God is in the market
</HEADLINE>

   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contemporary British political debate is a pawnbroker's auction. We are
offered second-hand lies, used slogans and recycled sound-bites. We are
bribed with money taken from our own pockets. This is hardly surprising.
Most of us, politicians and public alike, work in a moral and philosophical
vacuum. Marxist socialism has been exposed as rotten; any kind of socialism
as inefficient. So much for utopian creeds. Their infinitely more profound
erstwhile rival, Christianity, has become unfashionable, if not in the US
then at least on this side of the water. The ghost of Christian morality
lingers on, but the damage caused by the decline of religious observance is
already being felt. The moral foundations of public discourse have been
blown away.
Sporadic efforts are being made to find alternative lodestars. None of them
looks especially promising. This morning a new think tank opens for business
under the name of Demos. Organised by former proponents of Marxism, it is
supported by distinguished people with a wide range of views. Its
presentational literature reads like the wailing of a tribe of lost souls.
It proposes to find ' . . . new ways of giving shape to the democratic
ideal'. Politics, say the founders, 'needs to be enriched with the insights
of . . . anthropology, organisation theory, psychology, theology, biology,
geography, culture and communications theory'. Yes, theology is in there,
but religious practice, moral philosophy, Christian values, the human
spirit, are not evident.
I cannot say anything about the actual work of Demos. It has not yet
published any, beyond its 'statement of aims'. It may produce brilliant
papers; if so they will be welcomed. At the moment it is an empty box. To me
the wrapping is disappointing. The curse of the west in general and Britain
in particular is widespread anomie, a withering away of social and ethical
standards. The pragmatic Demos is a symptom of this late 20th-century
cultural deficiency. It does not have the appearance of a potential cure.
Against that it has to be acknowledged that the thinking business is not
what it was. There are more producers, but quality is hard to find. Some of
the brightest minds on the left are occupied, serving the Labour party's
commission for social justice. On the right, at least five organisations are
hopping about looking for audiences, acquiring one another's luminaries and,
I suspect, competing for funds. Schismatics have departed from the
grand-daddy of them all, the Institute of Economic Affairs. Yet the IEA's
rump is still churning out booklets, the latest being 'God and the
Marketplace', published yesterday1.
These have the merit of seeking to debate the morality of wealth creation.
During the past decade capitalism has been elevated to the role of the god
that succeeded. In one of the IEA essays a high priest of this endeavour,
Professor Michael Novak, puts his case once more, thus: 'What makes human
beings distinctive is creativity. The Pope has focused on this 'creative
subjectivity' of the person, seeing the endowment of a fundamental human
right to personal economic initiative.' True, but Centisimus Annus, John
Paul II's encyclical of 1991, also warns of the free market's limitations -
as one of the other contributing authors, Bishop John Jukes, reminds us.
The evidence is in the streets. Look at the beggars, or the lost faces in
the dole queues. In spite of Professor Novak's enthusiastic assertions,
capitalism exists side-by-side with growing unemployment, relative
deprivation and a level of absolute poverty that should not be accepted. The
numerical evidence can be found in 'Poverty the Facts', by Carey Oppenheim,
an up-to-date edition of which was published by the Child Poverty Action
Group yesterday2. As a pressure group, the CPAG piles on the agony, and
gives some of its statistics greater weight than they can carry, but at
least it does so with moral intent.
The same purpose informs Mr John Smith, Labour party leader, whenever he
speaks. In his Tawney memorial lecture at the weekend he came out
unashamedly as a Christian socialist. ' . . . Let me assert my profound
conviction that politics ought to be a moral activity,' he said. ' . . . We
should never feel inhibited in stressing the moral basis of what we
believe.' Mr Smith would be the first to agree that in so doing he is not
claiming a monopoly of ethical sentiment, either for himself or for Labour.
Other Labour front-benchers have contributed to a new book, 'Reclaiming the
Ground'3, the final chapter of which consists of Mr Smith's lecture. The
book reveals Labour's leading Christian socialists to be Mr Tony Blair, Mr
Paul Boateng and Mr Chris Smith.
A few devoted souls, not on the front bench, have trodden similar ground. Mr
Frank Field, a Labour MP who sparks off more bright ideas than all his
comrades put together, is a practising Christian. The name of R H Tawney,
who died in 1962, was taken in vain by the founders of the Social Democratic
Party in the 1980s. I am not sure how many of them were heathens. Among the
Tories there are Messrs John Patten, John Gummer and Peter Lilley. Beelzebub
records that Mr Lilley would rather take his instruction on church matters
from Mr Field than from Mr Gummer.
The central tenet of Christian socialism is no great mystery. As expressed
by Mr Blair, its principal element is 'the union between individual and
community, the belief that we are not stranded in helpless isolation, but
owe a duty both to others and to ourselves and are, in a profound sense,
dependent on each other to succeed'. This is in stark contrast to the cult
of the individual alone, which is what people mistakenly perceive to be the
wellspring of Thatcherism.
A morally-founded debate might reveal more similarities than differences
between Christians in different parties. In one of the IEA essays Simon
Robinson, Anglican chaplain at the University of Leeds, gamely tries to
reconcile Novak's thinking with Tawney's. Difficult. Yet in continental
western Europe the moral high ground sought by Mr Blair and Mr Smith is
familiar. It is occupied by Christian Democrats.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr KEN LIVINGSTONE MP.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was alarmed by your leader ('The choice over Russia', March 17)
advocating support for President Boris Yeltsin 'up to the point where the
president concentrates authority in his hands'. You suggest that the west
may have to choose 'an autocracy run by democrats'. This is a contradiction
in terms and decidedly not the choice in Russia.
The west told the Russian people that market reform and parliamentary
democracy were indivisible. Yet now, when the Russian parliament asserts its
prerogative to guide the reform process, they are told that some kind of
emergency, presidential rule and the suspension of parliament, are
preferable. If there are genuine concerns about democracy in Russia then
there is an evident and simple solution: immediate parliamentary and
presidential elections to determine whom the people wish to represent them.
That is far better than the imposition of emergency rule which might unleash
forces of disintegration that dwarf anything seen so far in eastern Europe.

contradiction (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D MARIO NUTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current major constitutional crisis in Russia poses an awkward
dilemma for the Group of Seven: whether to provide large-scale assistance to
Russia with the risk of its being wasted by a new government slowing down or
reversing stabilisation and transition, or wait and see, thus contributing
to Boris Yeltsin's demise. But there appear to be two forms of financial
assistance which could be safely and effectively pledged immediately,
regardless of future political and constitutional developments. These are:
the provision by IBRD (World Bank), EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development), and other financial institutions of investment funds for
energy, military conversion and agro-industry, which might be well utilised
in any case as long as they were not channelled through the Russian central
bank, which effectively sabotaged Gaidar's 1992 programme, but through more
direct and controllable channels;
the provision of funds to cover partially and up to a maximum ceiling, for a
half or whole year in the first instance, the cost of additional
unemployment in Russia. This form of assistance would be 'robust' with
respect to uncertain developments: if Yeltsin were ousted and stabilisation
and reform stopped or reversed there would be no significant increase in
unemployment and therefore the western commitment would be automatically
voided. An immediate announcement should strengthen popular support for
Yeltsin's likely initiatives, like a plebiscite or a presidential takeover.
The amounts involved in supporting additional unemployment may be
substantial. There has been a tendency to evaluate the effectiveness of
dollar grants at the purchasing power in Russia of their rouble equivalent
at a vastly undervalued exchange rate. However, aid would be used to finance
imports of consumption goods on which the unemployed would spend their
benefits, and therefore the dollar value of necessary real aid should be
calculated at international prices. Mario Nuti,

FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Look beyond Maastricht for role of UK in Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM MATHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate about Britain's role and future in the European Community
the Maastricht treaty itself is not the biggest issue. Since Maastricht now
lags behind the desire for political and institutional decentralisation
revealed across the Community during the debate on the treaty, the focus of
attention ought properly to shift to the next Inter-Governmental Conference
in 1996. This provides the opportunity for those who wish to make a
constructive contribution to prepare a detailed sketch of a new
constitutional and institutional settlement which will learn from the
Maastricht process.
It is encouraging that the foreign secretary has announced a programme of
work by the Foreign Office to prepare the ground so that Britain is not,
once again, unprepared to help shape this agenda.
The second big issue must be the impact of political and legal choices on
economic outcomes. It is astonishing that, until the first studies emerged
from this forum and the Confederation of British Industry, the consequences
for Britain of a 'detached' role in the EC had not begun to be addressed.
There obviously are consequences for policy outcomes affecting enlargement,
the single market, regulation, social costs and inward investment.
Not all will agree either the broad order of magnitude of these effects,
which our study estimated as potentially affecting national output of some
Pounds 10bn a year. Yet even for a light-hearted column, Dominic Lawson's
suggestion ('Sour sound of twisted surveys', March 20) that this work is
either the result of vested interests, or from 'the government's faithful
Euro-hound', the CBI, is shallow stuff. Conspiracy theory will really have
to be replaced by detailed and far-sighted intellectual effort if Britain is
to help work out a meaningful place in and future for the Community.

created two misconceptions in the minds of your readers.
First, that the funds of Britain's top 50 charities are all available for
distribution. In the case of Barnardo's, the majority of assets on our
balance sheet are in fact buildings which house our many child-care projects
around the UK. Without investing in property which, to borrow an ugly US
phrase, is 'critical to our mission', Barnardo's would not be able to
provide services to children and young people to the standard we believe
should be expected from a leading child care charity.
When assessing a charity's overall level of resources it is usually more
helpful to concentrate on analysing unearmarked reserves rather than total
funds.
Second, the article suggests that it is always a bad thing for charities to
have expenditure growing faster than income. It is regrettably true that
many charities currently have severe funding problems, but we must not
overlook the fact that a small number of charities hold high levels of
reserves. We should applaud those which are reducing reserves in a
controlled and responsible way by accelerating new projects and incurring
charitable expenditure greater than levels of income.
The problem with this subject is, to paraphrase the 1988 SORP2 statement on
charity accounting practice, that charities are very different and the
balance sheet is not necessarily a sound measure of wealth. The only way
round this is for donors to encourage charities clearly to outline their
reserve policy in their accounts.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Jackie Mason - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone should see Jackie Mason at least once, even Gentiles. The ex-Rabbi
from Brooklyn has an indefatigable zest that makes it hard for him to know
when to stop. Unless Jews really are different from other people, however,
even they might begin to see through the formula.
Mason has a marvellous talent for persuading an audience that he is up with
the latest news, whatever country he is in. On a previous visit, London was
in the throes of the salmonella crisis. 'This is the only country in the
world,' he remarked, 'where the sex is safer than the food.'
This time he seems to be equally up with the Maastricht Treaty and has fun
about people claiming to understand it when plainly they do not. Any attempt
at explanations ends in one of his many raspberries. That is in the first
half and you go away to the interval thinking how clever he is.
The trouble is that in the second half he uses exactly the same technique on
Shakespeare. 'Everyone says he's the greatest writer who ever lived . . .
How can you tell if no-one can understand a word of what he said?' He quotes
a few Shakespeare lines to no particular effect: the result is bathos for
the technique has been exposed - Mason trades on headlines, not subtleties.
The show falls into two interspersed parts: one (about two thirds of it) is
heavily Jewish, the other about broadly contemporary events such as the
arrival of President Clinton and the marital failings in the British royal
family. The first is hard for Gentiles (as he keeps calling us) to judge,
except to say that the joke about prime minister Rabin wanting to give back
the West Bank, but he can't because it's in his wife's name, is quite funny,
and that a long story about why Jews steal towels from hotels is, well,
laborious. Surely all Jews can't be as awful, the men so timid, the women so
dominating, as he suggests. Yet maybe the largely Jewish audience, which
kept up a murmur of approval throughout, think otherwise.
Even the jokes pegged on Britain are largely about money and sex, picked up
from the newspapers. 'Do you believe he had an affair with the caterer?'
Mason throws in early on. Then on to the Duchess of York: 'You can't play
with toes in front of the children]' As for her accountant escort, 'was he
counting on her toes? Can't he afford a new computer?'
It sounds better than it reads, but still wears thin. It is a pity he does
not use talents more widely. He does a sparkling tour d'horizon of the
troubles of the world - Iran, Iraq, Yeltsin etc, then retreats to the banal.
There is a good take-off of Henry Kissinger being applauded for talking
gibberish and an excellent exposure of Sinatra who never seems to finish a
song. For the rest, Mason performs like a man who can stop a few nights in
any theatre and pick up fistfuls of dollars. At least he admits it. He
continues at the Dominion tonight and tomorrow and, for all the caveats,
needs to be seen to be disbelieved.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Morbid modern message - William Packer questions the
artistic merit of 'installations'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem a bore to bang on yet again with the great 'modern: is it or
isn't it art' debate, but while our institutions continue to show the stuff,
the questions will hardly go away. Is whatever is put into a room enough to
constitute a work of art? Does the putting together, however so elegantly
and scrupulously, of given elements, constitute a work of art? And where do
such practices leave the careful carving and modelling that was the norm
only a generation ago? Three current exhibitions of sculpture set out the
issues.
Robert Gober, who, we are told in his blurb material, is in the forefront of
America's new generation, has, for his first solo show in Britain, rehung
the Serpentine throughout with wallpapers of his own design. One paper
carries only two images, of a man asleep in bed and, next to it, a black man
hanged upon a tree. Another, given in two ways, light on dark and dark on
light, is a little more complex, setting graffito-like male and female
genitalia beside each other. The most complex pattern is of trees in an
autumn wood, the ground covered in golden leaves. Not merely repeated but
inverted, the paper transforms the room into a glade, at least to the extent
that a drop-cloth achieves the same effect in a pantomime -
Babes-in-the-Wood, perhaps.
It would be unfair to dwell too long on the qualities of these essays in
decoration. Mr Gober is no draughtsman, and to say that they are crude,
alike in conception as in execution, is enough. But I do concede that here
they serve a higher purpose. The glade, for example, is further elaborated
by a huge cigar lying in the centre of the room, and against the walls some
pairs of truncated legs, set as though the rest of the unfortunate bodies
were burrowing into the piles of leaves. One is in his underpants, with
plug-holes set into his bare legs: another supports candles in square holes
cut through his trousers.
In the middle of the darker of the genitalia-decorated rooms sits a paper
bag full of doughnuts: the lighter room has an arm-chair in one corner, a
sack-like wax torso, half male, half female, in another, and more plug-holes
set into the wall. The bedroom has a wedding dress as its centre-piece, and
hand-painted bags of cat-litter against the walls.
Such are what Mr Gober calls his 'natural history dioramas about
contemporary human beings'. His publicity apologists go further, saying that
they evoke 'scenes of intimacy and social repression' that may be 'construed
as a reaction to the escalating horror of living today . . . His sculpture
stands as a provocation and a defiant challenge: not only to good taste and
good sense, but to the accepted practice and consumption of art.'
But is any of that true? Far from being provocative, Mr Gober is merely the
academic and the conformist, to which his burgeoning international
reputation bears eloquent witness. And what he actually does, with such
perfunctory competence, is no more than the staple of the anonymous
window-dresser, or the scene-painter, whose whole duty is merely to hold for
the moment a passing interest, enough for the message to get across.
Ah] The message] the horror of living today, AIDS, eroticism, perversion,
morbidity, death. And has he never looked at Breughel, Callot or Grunewald,
Goya or Picasso, Bellmer or Kienholz? Perhaps he has.
Susana Solano, at the Whitechapel, is a different case, again an artist who
has come to international prominence with remarkable rapidity - she began
working only in the late 1970s - yet one whose orthodoxy is formal rather
than conceptual. Her work is abstract, often set on a large scale, and her
practice the conventional manipulation and disposition of industrial
elements in an industrial way - welded, bent and bolted.
Her formal ideas are remarkably consistent, limited virtually to the single
theme of enclosure, upon which she works endless elegant variations - the
box; the cage; the drawer; the cabinet; the shelf; the cell. It is all
immaculately presented, every element set against the next just so, every
surface particular in its quality and contrast. Yet is it not all just a
little soulless and impersonal? Heavy metal is impressive by its very
presence, and elegant simplicity inevitably portentous. It is a formula less
to respond to than to respect.
Dennis Mitchell is now 80 and gravely ill. He has only ever been shown on
his own in London in small gallery shows, which makes the substantial
retrospective of his post-war work, now filling Angela Flowers' gallery all,
the more welcome. He has worked in Cornwall all his life, a true veteran of
Saint Ives in its pre-war days, his work founded in the simple, symbolic
abstraction of Brancusi and confirmed in the example of Barbara Hepworth.
Seen in the light of the Gobers and Damien Hirsts of this world, he must now
seem sadly old-fashioned and irrelevant a figure, yet here, personified in
the quiet, consistent achievement of a lifetime, an unexpectedly powerful
creative integrity distinguishes him - old-fashioned indeed. Carved and
modelled polished and patinated, everything carries the mark of the artist's
hand, unprogrammed and intuitive. Each curve and bend, each cavity and
convexity, each surface, is unique in its modulation and adjustment, the
purpose not merely to serve or indulge some external Goberean angst, but
simply to get it right, to make it true. I knew the work and had expected to
respect it: I had not expected to be so moved by it.
Robert Gober: Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens W2, until April 25,
then to the Tate Gallery, Liverpool; sponsored by Beck's Beer. Susana
Solano: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1 until May 2,

Today's Assignment sounds like a vivid example of the hypocrisy involved in
negotiations aimed at achieving a more united Europe. Everybody believes in
co-operation until their own interests are directly affected. We are told
that Europe is currently divided over bananas: Germany wants a free market
with low prices, but Britain, supposedly the great champion of free markets,
is keen to protect its old colonial suppliers. Julian Pettifer reports from
the banana republics on the effects of the world's big economies (7.45
BBC2). In the era of the big battalions it is good to know that, in wildlife
programmes at least, some one-man bands still succeed. Secret Nature which
tonight investigates the creatures inhabiting the freshwater world of
Slapton Ley in Devon, is produced, photographed, and narrated by Andrew
Cooper (8.30 BBC2). Without Walls follows Kazuko Hohki and her Tottenham pop
cabaret group Frank Chickens back to Japan where Kazuko decides to get
married (9.00). Stay up till 12.30 and you can watch the opening race in
Nigel Mansell's Indy Car 93 season (ITV).

FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Rhythm, heart and soul in Havana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN HENRIQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For several years Cuban bands and musicians such as Irakere, Gonzalo
Rubalcaba, Arturo Sandoval and Paquito D'Rivera have visited Britain and
Europe. Without exception their impact had been explosive. The big band
sound of the 12-piece Irakere, the technical mastery of pianist Rubalcaba,
the stratospheric gymnastics of trumpeter Sandoval and the hot-as-chili
alto-sax of D'Rivera have widened the ears of local audiences, notably at
Ronnie Scott's Club.
The link between the club and Cuban music since the mid-1980s has burgeoned
to such an extent that this year's international jazz festival in Havana was
jointly presented by the club in the persons of Scott and his partner Pete
King, in association with the Cuban Institute of Music.
King had sensed a deterioration in production at the last Cuban jazz
festival and promptly offered to co-produce this year's and guarantee the
necessary finance to attract international artists. Thus the sign in the
large courtyard of the Casa de Cultura, where the main concerts were held,
proclaimed: 'Ronnie Scott's Salutes Havana Latin Jazz Festival '93.'
Inevitably Irakere, this year celebrating its 20th anniversary, has featured
heavily, its pulsating Cuban rhythms never failing to stir the thousand-plus
Cubans into swaying, writhing activity in the cramped but atmospheric
open-air venue which sadly lacked dancing space. But it soon became clear to
visitors that Contemporary Cuban Music, whether labelled Latin jazz, salsa
or even rock-salsa, falls into two distinct compartments: the more
traditional, mainly acoustic sounds exemplified by bands like Irakere, and
the smaller groups with their emphasis on electronics and ugly-sounding
guitars to the detriment of the music's natural rhythms.
In the latter category was Cuarto Espacio which became a focal point mainly
because of its remarkable 19-year-old drummer, known simply as Jimmy, whose
multi-rhythm patterns, astonishing speed and power left audiences and
musicians gasping. A similarly rock-infested sextet, Perspectiva, paid
tribute to Miles Davis and also bowed in the direction of one of the
visiting British musicians with Song for Jim Mullen, not surprisingly
composed by the group's guitarist.
Keyboardist Pucho Lopez led a band which played what was described as
'avant-garde jazz-fusion,' a tag sufficient to dismay and alienate me but
which, like so many of the larger units, had an impressive front line, here
two saxes, trumpet and trombone. The sextet Diakara showed a strong African
influence with its accent on chants and repetitive rhythmic figures, which
were a reminder that repeated musical phrases and lyrics can become boring
to European listeners.
Of the larger bands, Bobby Carcasses and Afrojazz presented another aspect
of Cuban music. Leader Carcasses plays flugel-horn, sings, scats and on his
sung Summertime was accompanied solely by a dancer. Later he played what
looked like an ordinary rhomboid hollow box but which was a Cuban quinto, a
rhythm instrument developed from the African slit-drum.
The strong influence of rock on salsa was fiercely illustrated at one of the
concerts at the Karl Marx Theatre featuring singer Jackelin Castellanos and
the group JB. The band was of such ear-damaging power that it, and the
grossly over-amplified, distorted voice of the attractive but unintelligible
Castellanos, forced me to the aural safety of the back row of the upper,
upper circle. This was also the best position to appreciate the other band
of the evening, Elio Reve and his Charangon of Cuba. Reve, a genial,
white-suited veteran of the local scene, leads his band from the back on
timbales. His front line had four trombones plus three singers and the
disappointingly small audience was soon dancing in the stalls.
After so much enthusiasm it was bizarre to hear no applause between numbers
nor at the end of the concert, when the theatre curtain descended slowly on
the still-playing musicians - yet another side of the tradition of Cuban
music.
Illustrious American visitors, all of whom have played at Ronnie Scott's,
added extra quality to the week-long fiesta. The flamboyant
vibraphonist/singer Roy Ayers was a predictable favourite with his visual,
show-bizzy sets. Fluent, powerful tenor-saxist Chico Freeman, guesting with
several groups including Irakere, played a memorable 90 minutes with the
quartet of Chucho Valdes, Irakere's leader. But undemonstrative singer Irene
Reid, with her rich, bluesy voice, large ear-rings, tinted glasses and
visual proof that she was really enjoying herself, was almost certainly the
hit of Havana.
Amid all this vibrancy and excitement were the British bands: Ronnie Scott's
sextet, Andy Sheppard In Co-Motion and the Jim Mullen quartet. Their
polished but mainly introspective jazz lacked the essential outwardness of
the other bands and one pondered why they were chosen for Cuba. Lesser known
but more extrovert British groups could have been more suitable for a
festival where the most important qualifications for performers are rhythm,
heart and soul.
As well as late night sessions in various venues in Havana, there were
workshops, video shows and a photo exhibition in which British photographer
David Redfern was an exhibitor. Most of Havana's hotels have small bands of
varying quality playing the island's music and the lasting impression a
visitor takes away is of a throbbing, musical capital. Oh, those
percussionists] And those trumpeters with that distinct Cuban sound] Even at
the superlative Tropicana night-club the 20-plus band backing the singers,
dancers and speciality acts, sent a thrill down the spine with its
hard-blowing, precision playing.
In two years a lot can happen in jazz as in politics, and February 1995 is
the next chance to savour the sounds of hot Cuban music at the source in
festival conditions. Start saving now]

FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Britten's War Requiem - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday's War Requiem, given in the Albert Hall (and broadcast live on BBC2),
brought to an end Mstislav Rostropovich's mainly Barbican-based 'Festival of
Britten'. In spite of passing vagaries of execution - some of them caused,
it must be admitted, by the conductor's warm-hearted, imprecise beat - it
has proved a resounding success: a series that seized the musical public's
attention because its arrival was timely, its programming apt and its
overall purpose possessed of missionary enthusiasm.
It was, therefore, a particular shame that a good third of this War Requiem
should have been counterpointed by the loud double-clicking sound emitted
every ten seconds from the Albert Hall cupola - an electronic gremlin that
was allowed to persist unchecked for an everlasting-seeming 25 minutes. The
performance had set off with rapt, steady gravity, giving ample evidence of
the immaculate preparation of all its forces (London Symphony Orchestra plus
chamber orchestra conducted by Richard Hickox, hugely enlarged LS chorus,
boy-choristers from St Paul's Cathedral). But it was lamed by the continual
interruption: even when that was finally halted, the exalted atmosphere
proved hard to restore.
In such a case, a whole review is surely out of place; a few critical points
only are permissible. This work was destined - in spirit, if not in fact -
for the Albert Hall: its finest features are there emphasised and its
patches of mechanical inspiration (in the Offertorium, especially)
dramatically ballasted; voices solo and choral carry across the spaces with
radiant, heart-lifting ease. The soloists were Makvala Kasrashvili (a
shining, passionate soprano in the Vishnevskaya mould), Anthony Rolfe
Johnson (who, curiously, ignored all p-markings in the 'Agnus dei') and Bryn
Terfel (heroic-toned, vigorous in manner, a degree lacking in reflective
eloquence).
In aid of the Vishnevskaya-Rostropovich Foundation

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few segments of the South Bank's Towards the Millennium series have been as
imaginatively devised as the mini-festival of film music mounted this
weekend by Matrix and its conductor Robert Ziegler in collaboration with the
British Film Institute. The 1920s is the period currently under review; and,
since several significant figures were involved in the composition of scores
to accompany early silent features, the three days of events at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall were filled with events at once relevant to the series'
larger theme and greatly enticing in their own right.
But perhaps more imaginative still was the opportunity given to one of
today's prominent younger British composers, Jonathan Lloyd, to provide the
score for the BFI's handsomely cleaned-up new print of a famous early (1929)
Hitchcock film. Blackmail, of course, exists both in silent and sound
versions, but the greater artistic economy of the former was a point made
clear by Thursday's showing - and underlined by the punchy alertness to
incident, and laconic sensitivity to atmosphere of Lloyd's music.
His scoring is for chamber octet (strings, wind, brass, piano and
percussion); the influence of both Weill and Stravinsky is deliciously
evident, as is Lloyd's creative fingerprint of quirky wit (a loopy set of
variations on 'Two for Tea' unfolds under the developing triangle of girl,
policeman and artist). One left the hall hoping that Blackmail and its wryly
sympathetic new musical accompaniment will now be seen and heard together as
often as possible: they have forged a genuinely successful creative
partnership.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Love's Labour's Lost - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ipswich's Wolsey Theatre enjoys a high reputation in East Anglia for its
Shakespeare productions. This year it has ventured a new angle on Love's
Labour's Lost by bringing in nine European actors to perform the play's most
obviously European roles. The point is to reveal the international nature of
the play. But the stumbling-block is that, in four cases, the actors'
foreign accents are so strong as to render numerous lines impenetrable.
When the Princess of France speaks 'beseemeth' with the stress on the first
syllable, when her companion Maria says of Berowne 'Not a word with him but
a chest' (not 'jest'), you know that Love's Labour's Lost, a play stuffed
with wordplay, is going to flounder. Don Armado's verbosity seems odd, not
funny, in a Spanish accent; even a pompous line like 'Does thou infamonise
me among potentates?' sounds merely peculiar.
The pity is the more because the pacing and tone of Antony Tuckey's staging
is of a rare sensitivity. The war of wit and instinct is always alive, the
tension between intellectual rigour and sexual desire always exciting.
Shakespeare frequently celebrates wit, but seldom does he so plainly show
wit discomfited as here. For that reason, one can talk about this play in
the same breath as The Double Dealer, Mansfield Park and A Woman of No
Importance.
Two further flaws, however. It is a mistake to put Love's Labour's into
Edwardian attire. Shakespeare's plays belong in the period he set them
and/or the period he wrote them and/or the period we live in. To set them in
some interim period is to bypass Shakespeare for the sake of irrelevant
nostalgic prettiness. And it is cheap to have English actors occasionally
add 'Je suis' or 'N'est-ce pas?'.
The best contributions from continental Europe come from Sebastian Baur
(German/Italian) as Longaville and Birgitte Ohsten (Danish) as Jacquenetta -
not just because their words are always lucid to us but also because they
make Longaville's earnest/merry wit and Jacquenetta's flirtatious/used
situation unusually clear. As the King of Navarre and Princess of France,
the French actors Patrick Forster-Delmas and Carole Franck will make a
similarly keen impression if ever their words grow clearer; I never doubted
that they had an intelligent understanding of what they were saying. Ferran
Audi is a dolorous, unfunny, posey Don Adriano who nonetheless brings out
the character's impoverished and lovelorn pathos.
Not surprisingly, the audience falls gratefully on the British contingent.
Best is Robert Benfield, who ideally realises the curate Nathaniel's sweet
love of learning. Steven Mann has just the right merry attack for Berowne,
the play's hero of wit; Richard Cant is a somewhat refined Costard - never
the 'clown' Shakespeare calls him - but his sunny, gentle humour brings out
the tenderness of tone behind the play's rapierwork.
At the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, until April 10

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: P-E Intl shares fall 12% after tumble to
Pounds 160,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN P-E International fell by 12 per cent yesterday, from 58p to 51p,
after the management and computer consultancy group revealed a sharp
contraction in profits before tax last year and omitted the final dividend.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 160,000 from Pounds 1.62m in 1991 when the
outcome was depressed by a Pounds 541,000 exceptional item. The latest
results reflected the difficult market for management consultancy and the
cost of reshaping the business.
Turnover increased Pounds 71.1m (Pounds 68.8m) but operating profits fell to
Pounds 572,000 (Pounds 2.56m) reflecting higher selling and administration
expenses of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 16.6m) including a Pounds 343,000 pension
charge and a Pounds 100,000 write-down of property which has since been
sold.
Losses per share were 0.22p (earnings 4.9p); the passed final leaves the
total at 1p (6.2p).
Since taking over as chairman in May, Mr George Cox has instituted a
wide-ranging business review and reorganisation of the group and its senior
management. Commenting on the results he acknowledged that the level of
profits were 'not what the company would like to have achieved,' but said
that the third quarter of last year represented 'probably the lowest point
of the recession as far as P-E is concerned' and was followed by a stronger
final quarter.
During the year several small businesses acquired or created in recent years
were sold or closed. Aside from recording operating losses of Pounds 427,000
on these businesses, a Pounds 524,000 extraordinary loss, reflecting
goodwill previously written off to reserves, was recorded on the disposal of
Applied Skills for Management which was sold back to its former owner.
While some new businesses have been successfully turned around, other areas
are still under review.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares dive on warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Vibroplant, the plant hire group, yesterday fell 23 1/2 p to 42
1/2 p following a warning from directors that the results for the year to
end-March would be materially below market expectations.
As anticipated in the interim results announced last November, the group
experienced a decline in profitability in the second half with pressure on
both volumes and margins in the UK.
Furthermore, it suffered a 'significant' increase in bad debts during the
period.
In the US, there had been a sharp decline in activities in the fourth
quarter.
The preliminary results for the past year are due to be released in June. No
decision has yet been made concerning the final dividend.
For the 1991-92 year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.5m. A
final dividend of 2.38p made an unchanged total of 3.6p.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bank of Edinburgh calls off merger
discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Edinburgh, which was established in 1990 to take over small and
medium-sized building societies, yesterday disclosed that its first attempt
to do so by acquiring the Heart of England Building Society had failed.
The bank and the society announced that they had agreed not to proceed
further with merger discussions. One of the bank's shareholders said talks
had foundered on difficulties in gaining regulatory approval from the Bank
of England.
Mr Russell Frith, Bank of Edinburgh finance director, said the bank still
believed that it could acquire other societies. 'There is nothing we have
found that is wrong with the basic principle of what we wanted to achieve,'
he said.
The Heart of England, which is the 25th biggest society with assets of
Pounds 1.01bn, said it intended to continue to trade independently although
it did not rule out entering merger discussions with large building
societies. Mr Mike Travis, chief executive of the Heart of England, said the
society, which is due to report full-year results in April, would declare a
profit. 'It is business as usual, although we are disappointed that this
proposition did not go ahead,' he said.
The bank's largest shareholder is Scottish Amicable, which has a 39.2 per
cent stake. Mr Graham Knox, deputy managing director of Scottish Amicable,
said the negotiations had failed because of strict regulatory requirements.
Mr Knox said that the bank had not been able to satisfy a series of
requirements for it to retain a banking licence after taking over Heart of
England. He said it had learned a number of lessons that would be useful for
the future.
Mr Knox said that reports that Scottish Amicable wanted to take a majority
stake in the bank were incorrect.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BZW scrip scheme benefits BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET did no favours to the corporate financiers at BZW who yesterday
unveiled an ingenious scheme which will allow BAT Industries to offer
shareholders a scrip dividend worth 50 per cent more than its final cash
payment.
By promising to tackle the problem of surplus advance corporation tax next
year, the Chancellor limited the shelf life of a product which will be
closely examined throughout the City - even if it can only be of use to a
small minority
Mr Amir Eilon of BZW, said the problem with paying dividends in shares for
most classes of shareholders was that it was not very tax-efficient. Because
ACT is not payable on scrip issues, pension funds could not reclaim a
credit, and ordinary shareholders were liable to pay Capital Gains Tax on
the proceeds from selling the scrip shares. These considerations have meant
that take-up rates of scrip issues have only been 4-5 per cent by value.
The problem with scrip dividends for most companies is that, by expanding
the share base, they dilute the net asset value and earnings per share.
The numbers stack up favourably for only a few companies, such as BAT, which
has a high tax charge - because large overseas earnings produce an
unrelieved ACT problem - and which is confident it can employ cash
efficiently the dividend cash saved.
BZW said BAT, which had a year-end tax rate of 41.5 per cent, could save up
to Pounds 97m of ACT and up to Pounds 330m in cash by paying the dividend in
scrip.
The group's net asset value could be enhanced by as much as 6.2 per cent and
earnings per share would be undiluted so long as the group earned a return
on assets in excess of 9.3 per cent.
In fact, BAT's return on assets from its tobacco businesses is about 20 per
cent. Last year's earnings per share of 58.7p would be increased to 60.9p if
there was a 50 per cent take-up of the scrip issue, and 63.5p if there was a
full take-up.
What other companies could benefit from this sort of scheme - and why has
none done so before? BZW said possible candidates would have to pass through
two 'filters' - having both the ACT problem, and the ability to use the
money released profitably.
Mr Eilon said only a 'large handful' of FT-SE 100 companies fulfilled both
criteria, and BZW had approached several of them. He expected others to
follow in BAT's footsteps, although time was limited - the Chancellor said
he would solve the problem of unrelieved ACT by introducing Foreign Income
Dividends next year.
Another important element in the deal is BZW's offer of the cash
alternative. It will buy the 33.9p scrip at 32.2p - the 5 per cent discount
being to help cover the stockbroker's market risk in taking an unspecified
number of shares onto its books.
Most institutions which wish to sell will be able to obtain better terms in
the market themselves, but BZW's underwriting provides crucial liquidity at
a modest price for other shareholders. BZW said there was no 'magic
ingredient' in the scheme - 'just an awful lot of hard work'.
There might be some surprise that the Inland Revenue passed the scheme, but
Mr Eilon said he believed this was because it was with the grain of current
government thinking.
One institutional shareholder, Standard Life, said it was 'pretty
indifferent' about the proposal, which had nothing in it for gross funds -
institutions such as pension funds which pay no tax. BZW said said it was
confident that other institutional shareholders would provide the 75 per
cent majority needed at May's AGM.
Income funds are allowed to treat the scrip issue as income, but retail
investors in Personal Equity Plans may encounter some difficulties, if the
rules of their scheme oblige managers to take dividends rather than scrip.
BZW said BAT was trying to ensure that its corporate PEP could take the
scrip, but said the position of other PEPs would vary according to the rules
of the individual schemes.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Argos exceeds expectations - Retailer takes
Pounds 12.7m exceptional hit on Chesterman closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS, the catalogue retailer, tried to put the disappointment of the
failure of its Chesterman furniture store venture behind it yesterday, and
announced annual profits ahead of City expectations.
Although the outcome for the year to January 2 of Pounds 52.9m pre-tax
represented a 15 per cent fall from last year's Pounds 61.9m, it included
operating losses of Pounds 6.2m from Chesterman and exceptional costs of
Pounds 12.7m to cover its closure.
Stripping out all the Chesterman costs, pre-tax profits would have been
Pounds 71.8m, up 12 per cent from a restated Pounds 63.1m last year.
The shares rose 10p to 315p, as the City welcomed a 9.4 per cent increase in
the total dividend to 7p via a final of 4.8p. Earnings per share, however,
fell to 11.7p (13.9p) including the Chesterman losses and provisions.
Turnover rose to Pounds 1bn (Pounds 926.6m), and although this was boosted
slightly by a 53-week rather than 52-week trading year, Argos said the
figure represented a 'significant improvement'.
Like-for-like sales growth in the second half of the year was 3.1 per cent,
giving a total of 1.8 per cent for the year as a whole. Mr Mike Smith, chief
executive, said the improvement reflected management initiatives taken in
the last two years, including integrating its superstore and traditional
store catalogues, and abandoning its experimental limited-range Best Seller
stores, converting them into traditional showrooms.
'The improved sales trend from the second half of last year has continued
into the first quarter of this year. But it is too early to talk of a real
recovery,' Mr Smith said.
Textiles and DIY sales declined due to a reduced textiles range and the
decision not to match the heavy discounting of other DIY retailers. But
there was significant growth in the furniture range, as well as jewellery,
watches and clocks.
Many analysts upgraded their forecasts for this year's profits from the
Pounds 72m to Pounds 75m range to Pounds 80m or more, but some said the
closure of Chesterman might lessen the group's appeal to investors.
'These were good figures, there's no doubt about it,' one analyst said
yesterday. 'But to us they fit in the worthy but dull category.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Frogmore slides 4% to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITIGATION COSTS and increased interest charges held back interim profits at
Frogmore Estates, the property company.
At the pre-tax level they fell 4 per cent to Pounds 4.16m in the six months
to December 31.
Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 22.2m on the back of a sharply increased
rent roll, which grew from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 18m through acquisitions,
rent reviews and new lettings.
Interest charges, however, rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 2.5m.
Borrowings at the end of December stood at Pounds 55m, compared to Pounds
45.8m at the end of June and Pounds 7m the previous December. Frogmore
de-geared heavily as the property recession bit, but has since taken on new
borrowing.
Frogmore also included a Pounds 1.5m charge for litigation costs arising
from a dispute over the acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH in 1986. Mr
David Wilmot, finance director, said the issue was now closed and no further
costs would be incurred.
Earnings per share were 6.9p (7.5p). The interim dividend is 3.6p (3.4p).

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pendragon Pounds 16.6m rights to help fund
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENDRAGON, the motor distributor demerged from Williams Holdings, yesterday
launched a 1-for-4 rights issue at 225p to fund acquisitions as it reported
an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
Profits rose from Pounds 4.73m to Pounds 5.23m on increased sales of Pounds
214.6m (Pounds 168.3m).
The rights issue will raise Pounds 16.6m, net of expenses, leaving the group
with net cash of Pounds 7.8m to fund its expansion programme. The shares
fell 8p to 276p.
Since the beginning of 1991 Pendragon has increased its franchises by 29 to
50. Its last cash call, in June 1991, raised Pounds 11m, of which Pounds
5.2m was invested in a Mercedes-Benz dealership and another Pounds 4.2m in
other projects.
However, last year another Pounds 9.4m was invested in various projects
which turned a net cash position of Pounds 2.1m into net borrowings of
Pounds 8.8m, representing gearing of 26.9 per cent.
Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said: 'The rights issue will allow us to
continue with a programme of expansion while maintaining a healthy balance
sheet.'
He said the declining car market and recession had meant that the
performance of many of the past investments had not reflected their profit
capability. Consequently, Pendragon's expansion with some manufacturers is
not likely to continue at the same pace.
Instead the group is to concentrate on selected infill acquisitions in large
urban areas and on investment in big market segments in which the group does
not have a significant presence.
New car gross profits improved from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 9.1m, while
overall new car sales in the UK were flat at 1.6m units.
Earnings per share were 12.2p (12.1p). The final is 4.4p making 6.6p (6p).

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: P-E Intl shares decline 12% after tumble to
Pounds 160,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN P-E International fell by 12 per cent yesterday, from 58p to 51p,
after the management and computer consultancy group revealed a sharp
contraction in profits before tax last year and omitted the final dividend.
Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 160,000 from Pounds 1.62m in 1991 when the
outcome was depressed by a Pounds 541,000 exceptional item. The latest
results reflected the difficult market for management consultancy and the
cost of reshaping the business.
Turnover increased Pounds 71.1m (Pounds 68.8m) but operating profits fell to
Pounds 572,000 (Pounds 2.56m) reflecting higher selling and administration
expenses of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 16.6m) including a Pounds 343,000 pension
charge and a Pounds 100,000 write-down of property which has since been
sold.
Losses per share were 0.22p (earnings 4.9p); the passed final leaves the
total at 1p (6.2p).
Since taking over as chairman in May, Mr George Cox has instituted a
wide-ranging business review and reorganisation of the group and its senior
management. Commenting on the results he acknowledged that the level of
profits were 'not what the company would like to have achieved,' but said
that the third quarter of last year represented 'probably the lowest point
of the recession as far as P-E is concerned' and was followed by a stronger
final quarter.
During the year several small businesses acquired or created in recent years
were sold or closed. Aside from recording operating losses of Pounds 427,000
on these businesses, a Pounds 524,000 extraordinary loss, reflecting
goodwill previously written off to reserves, was recorded on the disposal of
Applied Skills for Management which was sold back to its former owner.
While some new businesses have been successfully turned around, other areas
are still under review, including Westvries, the group's Netherlands
subsidiary, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 394,000 last year.
The group has been attempting to develop its overseas revenue as part of its
efforts to generate new long term contracts and longer-term revenue sources.
Last year, after above-the-line costs of about Pounds 750,000, Mr Cox said
'substantial progress' had been made towards this objective and the
proportion of group revenues coming from outside the UK increased from 19
per cent to 27 per cent at the year end.
Gearing rose from 22 per cent to 32 per cent and net borrowings increased
from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 4m by the year-end. Subsequently borrowings have
increased substantially, mainly because of corporation tax payments and the
settlement of creditors.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram puts blame on accounting rules
for fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM, the kitchens and bathrooms group, yesterday announced that
pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 26.2m last year on flat
sales of Pounds 193.6m.
It blamed new accounting rules, a new mood of conservatism in the accounting
profession and a desire to clear up speculation about its practices, hence
the haggling with auditors Arthur Andersen.
As the interim results, announced in September, showed an Pounds 18.4m
pre-tax profit, Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, admitted they might have to be
'revisited' - otherwise the full-year figures show a second-half profit of
less than Pounds 8m, down from about Pounds 20m.
Mr Rooney said that until very recently the group thought it would make
Pounds 39m pre-tax. Then it discovered that other companies were reporting
1992 figures under the new FRS 3 accounting rule.
'From there it escalated. I didn't know about Fred 4 (a draft standard)
until last Wednesday morning.'
The biggest item in the list of Pounds 12.9m profit reductions made in
response to accounting changes was Pounds 5.6m of profits pushed back into
1993.
Of this Pounds 4.1m was for the sale of land for retail development -
including Ikea and Toys 'R' Us stores. Mr Ron Farr, director of the special
products division, said title to the land had changed hands subject to
planning permission, which was obtained in January. A deposit had been paid,
but not the remainder.
Property disposal profits still amounted to about Pounds 2m, down from about
Pounds 5m in 1991. The division benefited from increased exports.
In kitchens, about Pounds 1.5m of profit was disallowed on sales to
distributors who were trying to beat a January price rise. Profits had not
been allowed on stock delivered later than January.
This was one of the reasons for a Pounds 1.4m fall in operating profit in
the division to Pounds 12.1m. Another was that Pounds 4m of product
development costs had been put through the profit and loss account rather
than capitalised.
The bathrooms division fell to a loss of Pounds 4.87m, compared with Pounds
5.02m profit. This included a Pounds 3.06m charge for previously overstated
profits at Balterley Bathrooms. Mr David Riley said Spring Bathrooms was
also losing money.
Savings of Pounds 1.5m were being made in the division's overheads.
Reorganisation costs amounted to about Pounds 1m.
Other accounting changes affecting the figures were the exclusion of Pounds
1.28m transferred from the revaluation reserve and Pounds 1.4m of government
grants.
Depreciation of freehold buildings for the first time knocked off a further
Pounds 660,000.
The group stressed that the 1991 figures were only reduced by Pounds 1.4m
following the application of FRS 3. This involved the comparatively small
figures in the revaluation transfer and depreciation.
After Pounds 31.7m of capital spending and Pounds 15m on buying and
absorbing debt in Stag Furniture, the group had Pounds 10m net cash at the
year end, down from Pounds 45m.
Earnings per share fell to 5p (6.8p). A final dividend of 0.243p makes a
total of 0.346p (0.288p).

FT  23 MAR 93 / Wilkinson Sword sold at a loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER-LAMBERT, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products manufacturer,
yesterday agreed to buy Wilkinson Sword, the razor and toiletries company,
from a consortium of international investors for Dollars 142m (Pounds 100m)
in cash.
The deal ends prolonged uncertainty about the future of Wilkinson, which has
changed hands four times since 1980 and has been burdened by mounting debt.
However, the sale price is substantially less than the total investments
made in the business by its current owners.
The sale should permit a settlement of the legal conflict between
international anti-trust authorities and Gillette, the US leader in the
world wet shaving market, which indirectly owns shares in Wilkinson and is
one of its largest creditors.
Warner-Lambert said the acquisition would expand its international sales of
shaving and personal care products. Though the company's Schick brand is
number two in the US razor market, it has only a limited presence in Europe.
Wilkinson, which last year launched an advanced shaving system known as
Protector, sells mostly in Germany and Britain and has a factory in each
country. It had sales last year of Dollars 190m, on which it made a small
trading profit, while Schick's worldwide sales totalled Dollars 316m.
Wilkinson has been owned since 1988 by Eemland, a Dutch-registered holding
company which purchased the business from Stora, the Swedish forest products
group.
Eemland's shareholders include several Scandinavian financial institutions
and JP Morgan, the US bank. Gillette owns a 22 per cent non-voting stake in
Eemland and has loaned it more than Dollars 100m.
Eemland put Wilkinson up for sale last year after its Scandinavian
shareholders decided they could not afford to inject further capital. In
addition, Gillette has been ordered by the European Commission and
anti-trust authorities in several countries to end its involvement in
Eemland, on the grounds that it is anti-competitive.
Warner-Lambert will not assume Eemland's debt of about Dollars 300m. The
deal provides for a small additional payment if Wilkinson's Protector sales
meet specified targets, it is understood the total proceeds will leave
Eemland's shareholders with a loss of Dollars 200m.

<TEXT>
HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure group
controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, reported a 20 per cent rise in attributable
profits to HKDollars 843.6m (USDollars 109m) in the first half to December,
from HKDollars 700.2m a year earlier.
The increase was almost entirely the result of non-recurrent earnings from
the sale of two of the group's development projects, Wu Chung House and Hing
Wai Industrial Centre. These accounted for 61 per cent of operating profits.
The interim dividend is being increased to 16 cents a share from 14 cents.
But investors continue to focus on the company's ambitious longer-term
infrastructural projects. The company said phase one of the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen super-highway would be in by the end of 1993, resulting
in an early completion bonus payable in the 1993-1994 fiscal year.
The company is also investing in a USDollars 3bn Bangkok elevated rail and
road system, a section of the Guangzhou ring road and power stations in
China and the Philippines.
These projects have been funded through property sales, and new equity.
In 1994, Hopewell will complete the Hongkong International Trade &amp;
Exhibition centre, its Broadwood Road residential project and part of the
Nova Taipa development in Macau, which will provide further substantial
capital inflows.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday unveiled a new, inexpensive desktop
business video system which allows two personal computer operators to see
each other on their computer screens while simultaneously talking and
manipulating data.
The product is not the first of its kind, but AT&amp;T's marketing muscle could
help this multi-media technology become much more widely accepted as a
business tool.
AT&amp;T yesterday committed its business video products to be based on globally
accepted standards for calls over digital phone lines, allowing its products
to work with others equipped with the same standards.
The company also said the product was one of the first large fruits of
collaboration between AT&amp;T's business communications unit, its
micro-electronics operation and NCR, the computer company acquired by AT&amp;T
in a hostile and controversial 1991 takeover.
The system, the first to employ AT&amp;T Microelectronics' AVP 4000 chipset for
compressing video images, produces slow motion pictures of about 10 frames
per second and operates through special AT&amp;T business switches or a digital
telephone line.
The cost of a unit starts at Dollars 6,995.
Delivery will begin in the US in the autumn and international marketing may
follow next year.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hongkong Land rises to Dollars
305m despite rental fall - Hong Kong Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm which
dominates Hong Kong's central office market, yesterday announced a 2.3 per
cent increase in net profits to USDollars 305m in 1992, up from Dollars
298.1m the year before.
The company confirmed it would exercise its option to increase its
shareholding in Trafalgar House, the UK construction, engineering and
shipping group, to 27 per cent from 20.1 per cent.
However, Mr Alisdair Morrison, managing director, said this would represent
only 6.5 per cent of shareholders' funds, and the group would continue to
focus on its core Hong Kong portfolio.
Hongkong Land, chaired by Mr Simon Keswick, will pay a final dividend of 6.5
US cents per share, representing a total 1992 dividend of 9.5 cents,
compared with 9 cents in 1991.
The company experienced a marginal fall in rental income last year as a
result of tenancies being renegotiated at below the property market's 1989
peak.
This phase will continue in 1993, with little growth expected. However, the
directors emphasised the 18 per cent increase to Dollars 1.95 in the
company's net asset value per share, as a result of the turnaround in office
property prices in 1992.
Hongkong Land sold its Number Nine Queen's Road tower block for USDollars
491m last year, but Mr Morrison said no other of the group's properties were
on the market.
He was confident that, with limited new supply of office space in the
central district, asset values would continue to rise.
The increase in last year's profits was due to a Dollars 18.7m reduction in
finance charges, as a result of debt reduction through property sales.
In 1993, the group will gain a maiden contribution from its Trafalgar House
investment, which will be equity accounted from April.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: JAL maps out a route to recovery
 -Japan's flag carrier is fighting for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE last summer, two new Boeing 747-400 jets belonging to Japan Airlines
(JAL), the Japanese flag carrier, have been parked in storage in the US.
Pilot resistance delayed the purchase for nearly three years, but when the
aircraft were delivered JAL had insufficient pilots trained to fly them.
The lessons of this experience have cast a shadow over a restructuring
programme the airline is planning for the next two years.
A sharp fall in business travel due to Japan's economic downturn and an
increasingly cut-throat international aviation market mean JAL's very
survival depends on the restructuring programme.
This, in turn, depends on winning the co-operation of JAL's often unruly
labour unions. It means dismantling the long-established co-operation
between labour and management, in which the unions have traditionally held
the upper hand.
JAL, which reported pre-tax losses of Y6bn (Dollars 51m) on revenues of
Y1,114bn in the year to March 1992, is forecasting pre-tax losses of Y50bn
for this year and will pass its dividend for the first time since it was
privatised in 1987.
The airline aims to break even in the year to March 1994 and return to
profit the year after. It does not expect to be able to resume dividend
payments until the following year.
JAL's directors paint a bleak picture of the group's prospects. 'The next
two years will be the most important for the survival of the company,' a
company publication noted.
With 70 per cent of JAL's business on international routes, it has been hurt
more than All Nippon Airways, its domestic rival, by the downturn in
business travel.
Competition has been fierce on international routes, particularly from US
airlines offering cheap fares as a quick way to enter and expand their share
of the market. As a result, JAL is losing money on most international
routes. Only those to China and other parts of Asia and Oceania are in
profit.
Mr Chikara Sugimoto, director of international affairs, says: 'Overall, the
number of passengers flying hasn't fallen, but yields have fallen because
everyone is flying economy.'
In the 10 months to the end of January, first class travel fell by 18 per
cent and business class by 16 per cent. Domestic business has also fallen.
JAL's problems however result from a combination of: Failing to spot these
changing market trends;
A labour policy dictated largely by the unions;
High costs resulting from being based in Japan;
Over-dependence on international and business class travel;
Several years of expansion that have left it a bloated, inefficient
organisation.
The restructuring is aimed not only at cutting costs but also refocusing its
operations to reflect Japan's changed aviation market. To cut costs it is
reducing the number of B747-400 aircraft it is buying by 25, cutting staff
costs, increasing the use of leased aircraft and curbing other investment.
Earlier this month, JAL announced that 375 flight attendants it planned to
hire in April would not be taken on until September. The airline is also
aiming gradually to replace up to 30 per cent of Japanese cabin crew with
foreign staff, who cost about half in overheads. For an airline which boasts
flight attendants who were graduates of Tokyo University, Japan's most
prestigious academic institution, that may not be an easy task.
From April 1, it plans to abolish an employee savings scheme offering an
interest rate of 9.72 per cent. It is negotiating to withdraw employee
benefits, such as limousine services for flight attendants, and studying an
early retirement programme.
At the same time, JAL is trying to reduce its dependence on international
business and aims to raise the share of domestic revenue from 30 per cent to
40 per cent of the total.
For JAL, which has long shunned discount tickets but had been able to
increase business without cultivating the budget-conscious holiday
traveller, the need to restructure has been intense. For a growing number of
Japanese travellers the comfort and security of travelling JAL is no longer
worth the high price.
Mr Geoffrey Tudor, director of public relations, says: 'We have got to get
back into the market place.'
However, the price war on international routes is escalating and competition
for international traffic will increase with the opening of Kansai
International Airport in 1994 and the expansion of Haneda and Narita
airports.
In the long run, JAL's survival will also depend on how far and how fast it
can shed its glamorous high-flying past for a more down-to-earth approach to
today's market realities.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Some neat financial engineering
designed primarily to raise equity - A look at the latest batch of targeted
share schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARGETED shares have recently hit the headlines as some of the big US
corporations, including RJR Nabisco and Ralston Purina, unveiled plans to
introduce the catchily-named stock.
However, these shares, designed to reflect the fortunes of a portion of a
company's business rather than that of the group as a whole, are not exactly
new.
The best-known scheme was introduced at USX in 1991. Mr Carl Icahn, the
financier-cum-greenmailer, had acquired a 13.3 per cent stake in the
Pittsburgh-based company and was agitating for a full demerger of USX's
steel and energy interests.
In February 1991, USX responded with a targeted stock plan, which offered
one group of shares pegged to the steel business's performance and one to
its energy assets, notably Marathon Oil.
USX subsequently added a third class of shares, called USX-Delhi, to reflect
the natural gas unit's performance. The scheme duly bought peace, and Mr
Icahn sold his stake shortly afterwards.
Even USX had forerunners. General Motors, for example, has long offered a
set of Series E shares, which reflect the performance of its EDS subsidiary,
and another set of Series H shares, which mirror the performance of its
Hughes Electronics business.
Nevertheless, targeted stocks have been receiving increased attention,
largely because of the activities of big consumer products groups.
RJR Nabisco announced plans earlier this month for two classes of shares
reflecting, in turn, the group's food and tobacco interests.
A few weeks earlier, Ralston Purina, trying to separate out its large but
lacklustre Continental Baking division from its other consumer products
operations, substituted a targeted stock scheme for a full demerger plan.
Disgruntled bondholders at Marriott Corporation have suggested a targeted
stock scheme would be a better option than the highly-contentious spin-off
proposed by the hotel and food services group. And there has even been talk
that IBM might adopt a targeted stock plan, although the company maintains
this is highly speculative.
Mr Ronald Gallatin, the managing director at Lehman Brothers who devised the
USX scheme and has been involved with many of the subsequent initiatives,
maintains that 'any company where the sum of the parts is greater than the
whole', but where multiple spin-offs are not feasible, could be suited to a
targeted stock scheme.
The obvious attraction of targeted stocks is that they focus attention on
the progress being made by individual divisions. In theory, this addresses
the problem complained of by some conglomerates - that relatively successful
businesses are dwarfed by problems elsewhere in the group.
Second, management incentives can be aimed more specifically, a factor
behind the separate GM stock series. And finally, capital can be raised by
the sale of new securities pegged to the more attractive elements of a
group's overall business.
RJR Nabisco, for example, expects to garner about Dollars 1.5bn from the
initial flotation of shares pegged to its food division. Ralston's chairman,
Mr William Stiritz, has claimed the plan will 'increase flexibility with
regard to future capital raising requirements and acquisition
opportunities'.
However, it is obvious these same advantages would flow from a full
demerger. Targeted stock schemes tend to come into play when there are
obstacles to legally dividing a company's operations - because of
liabilities (including debt obligations) faced by the group as whole, or for
tax or administrative reasons.
Mr Gallatin cites three considerations which may render the targeted stock
approach more suitable than a demerger: economies of scale derived from
keeping the businesses under one administrative umbrella, economies of
insurance (if, for example, the company self-insures), and where there are
tax drawbacks to a demerger.
RJR is a case in point. Following the record-breaking Dollars 25bn leveraged
buy-out in 1989, the company conducted a speedy disposal programme and has
engaged in a string of refinancings and capital restructurings.
However, it has struggled to galvanise its two core operating businesses -
the food group, where products range from Planters nuts to Oreo cookies, and
the cigarette business.
The cloud hanging over the latter has been particularly dark of late.
Cigarette consumption has been on a declining trend for years in the large
US domestic market, and possible tax increases by the Clinton administration
threaten to accelerate the trend.
Within the shrinking market, a rise in the popularity of discount cigarettes
is undermining the position of higher-margin, full-priced brands, including
Phillip Morris's Marlboro and RJR Nabisco's Winston and Salem. The costs of
defending these products are rising.
Under these domestic pressures, operating profits from RJR's tobacco
business fell in 1992 to Dollars 2.69bn from Dollars 2.73bn in 1991. The
food division managed an operating profit advance to Dollars 947m from
Dollars 920m. But a full demerger of RJR Nabisco is viewed as impossible -
not least because the problem of tobacco litigation.
Like all tobacco manufacturers, RJR faces liability suits. Removing a
substantial portion of the group's assets from the potential line of fire
via a conventional spin-off, would not pass muster. Investors in the group's
debt securities would scarcely cheer, either.
Unfortunately, the appeal of a targeted stock scheme - the fact that there
is no legal division of assets - is its weakness. Such plans can smack of
window dressing, and yield relatively little benefit in share price terms.
Shares in RJR Nabisco, for example, have barely budged on the back of the
targeted stock announcement.
'A bit of neat financial engineering designed primarily to raise new equity,
with the secondary benefit of somewhat sheltering shareholders from
tobacco's legal and psychological risk,' was how analysts at Oppenheimer
described the announcement. They concluded that there was little in the
transaction for shareholders.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Murdoch considers NY Post bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chairman of News Corporation, is considering the
possibility of entering the battle to determine the future of The New York
Post, the troubled tabloid newspaper he once owned.
The newspaper has been traumatised over the past 10 days by the arrival of
Mr Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric New York car parks magnate who has sacked
and re-hired a number of staff, including Mr Pete Hamill, the paper's
editor.
Last week, a New York bankruptcy court approved Mr Hirschfeld's plan to take
control of the paper, even though a rival bid is being offered by Mr Steven
Hoffenberg, a debt collector who is being sued for fraud by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Mr Murdoch, who was forced to sell the paper in 1988 as a result of federal
legislation, is understood to be watching developments at The Post very
closely. He has put senior executives on standby in case he becomes actively
involved in a formal rescue of the newspaper.
Given the unprecedented venom being directed at Mr Hirschfeld by the paper's
editorial staff - a headline last week about Mr Hirschfeld read 'Who is this
Nut?' - the future of the newspaper is by no means certain.
Mr Murdoch could only intervene if the paper were in danger of foundering
once again. He would need a government waiver allowing him to own both The
Post and his local Fox television station in New York.
The 73-year-old Mr Hirschfeld, when informed of Mr Murdoch's possible
interest, said: 'Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to get on the news because
of me, Mr Hirschfeld. There are homeless people who want to buy The Post.
'If Mr Rupert Murdoch wants to come to me I would be happy to talk to him,'
he added.
Although Mr Murdoch's US interests are predominantly in film and television,
he has told friends there are times when it is 'difficult to resist the
temptation' of buying newspapers when the right opportunity presents itself.
Mr Hirschfeld, meanwhile, yesterday barred four senior New York Post
staffers from entering the building.
The four were among 20 employees who were sacked last week.

INTEL, the US semiconductor group, yesterday began officially shipping its
newest and most powerful personal computer microprocessor, the Pentium,
which is designed to preserve its status as the world's leading chip-maker
through much of the 1990s, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The company said it would ship hundreds of thousands of Pentium
microprocessors this year, with volume passing the 1m mark in 1994. Intel
microprocessors are the brains for over 70 per cent of the world's personal
computers. The Pentium will provide increased power for applications such as
complex financial analysis and computer-aided design.
The Pentium contains 3.1m transistors, compared to 1.2m on Intel's current
486 model. It performs 112m instructions per second, making it five times
faster than the original 486.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: How the scheme works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TARGETED stock scheme does not involve any formal spin off of any assets
or operations, unlike a conventional demerger, where a company divides its
business into different legal entities.
Instead, the company - with agreement from existing shareholders - makes a
tax-free distribution of new shares designed to reflect the performance of
one division. The existing shares are usually renamed, and reflect
performance of the remaining operations.
Both series of shares are quoted, and the company notionally divides its
assets and liabilities between these two divisions. This allows it to report
separate financial results for each.
However, from a legal standpoint, relatively little changes. The company
remains responsible for all liabilities and assets, and the rights of
bondholders and other creditors are maintained. The different series of
stock vote together on corporate matters, such as the election of directors.

<TEXT>
SCHERING, Germany's pharmaceutical and agrochemical group, expects turnover
to increase by 4 per cent to DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.25bn) this year. But it
warned that reforms to the country's health system would affect sales.
Mr Guiseppe Vita, chairman, said sales in Germany would fall to about
DM680m, compared with last year's DM730m. Doctors would be buying cheaper
pharmaceutical products, and domestic manufacturers would face stiffer
competition from the reimport of pharmaceutical products from other European
countries, he said.
Net profits last year amounted to DM262m, a fall of 4.4 per cent on the
previous year. Mr Vita said profits has been lifted by about DM20.1m from
the sale of the group's industrial chemicals, organic chemicals, and
electroplating operations.
Extraordinary profits amounted to DM124.8m.
Excluding gains earned from the sales of the three divisions, operating
profits in 1992 fell by 8 per cent, or DM43m, to DM503m on the previous
year, while per share earnings for 1992 fell to DM38, against DM44 for 1991.
Last year, pharmaceuticals accounted for 95 per cent of the group's
earnings, an increase of 17 per cent in 1991. Mr Vita said pharmaceutical
sales were expected to increase by 5 per cent this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the giant American brewer has agreed to buy 18 per cent of
Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewer, for about Dollars 477m. The deal
would be one of the largest foreign equity investments in Mexico and the
first in the tightly-controlled beer market.
Mr Juan Sanchez Navarro, vice-president of Modelo, said the joint venture
'is an example of strategic associations that will be increasingly seen in
other sectors' as Mexican businesses gear up for the implications of free
trade in North America.
Modelo's only rival in Mexico, Femsa, is also looking for a foreign partner
in its soft drink and beer businesses.
The terms are that Anheuser-Busch will buy a 10 per cent stake in Grupo
Modelo and 10 per cent in its fully-owned subsidiary Diblo, giving it an
effective 17.7 per cent of the Modelo Group.
After Anheuser acquires its stake, the Grupo Modelo will seek a listing on
the Mexican stock market. It plans to issue 13 per cent of its capital,
split equally between Mexican and international markets, for which it hopes
to get around Dollars 270m.
Modelo controls 51 per cent of Mexico's beer market and makes Mexico's
best-selling international beer, Corona. It has sales of around Dollars
1.5bn and is the tenth biggest brewer in the world. Exports - to 56
countries - are worth Dollars 150m.
Anheuser has an option to increase its stake to 35 per cent. It will take
three seats on Modelo's board of directors.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank maintains dividend

<TEXT>
THE SUPERVISORY board of Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest commercial
bank, yesterday agreed to bolster reserves and offer an unchanged DM10
dividend for 1992 following one-off 53 per cent surge in group net profits.
Earnings rose to DM838m (Dollars 513m) from DM547m, mainly as a side-effect
of the absorption last October of the Berlin subsidiary into the parent,
Commerzbank AG.
After correction, like-for-like net earnings were still higher than in 1991,
the bank said.
Profits at the parent company rose from DM447.5m to DM746.5m. The board also
agreed to allocate DM443m to group reserves, compared with DM235m last time.
At the annual meeting on May 7 it will ask shareholders to agree the issue
of up to 1m additional profit-sharing certificates in a further move to
strengthen the bank's capital base.
Full details of the bank's 1992 performance and prospects for the current
year will be released later this week.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, who in January announced a 20 per
cent rise in operating profits to around DM2.2bn, said at the time that a
higher dividend would be 'inappropriate'.
Provisions for debts in the former Soviet Union would rise from 60 per cent
to around 80 per cent. The group would also provide against its exposures to
Hafnia, the Danish insurer, and the Olympia &amp; York property group.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bid paves way for Danish
solution - Hilary Barnes and Richard Lapper assess Baltica's plan for
survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALTICA'S bid to buy the insurance and banking operations of Hafnia, its
biggest domestic rival, could come to an ironic conclusion. After all, it
was Hafnia's efforts to acquire Baltica which contributed significantly to
the industry's crisis in Scandinavia.
Baltica's move also paves the way for a 'Danish solution', in which Den
Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank, and other local institutional investors
could play a crucial role.
Baltica and Hafnia became locked in a bitter struggle in 1990, when Hafnia
acquired just over 33 per cent of the shares in Baltica Holding, a blocking
minority enabling Hafnia to veto decisions by Baltica's shareholders.
Although it was unable to persuade Baltica to join forces with it, Hafnia's
acquisition weakened its rival.
Hafnia's stranglehold forced Baltica to rely on bank debt rather than new
equity capital to finance the DKr4bn acquisition of the former
state-controlled life insurance company, Statsanstalten, in 1990, for
example.
Losses at Baltica's banking subsidiary added to the group's difficulties.
Cash-flow problems became acute when property investments in Denmark and
Gibraltar went wrong.
Meanwhile, Hafnia's own problems mounted when it joined forces with UNI
Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, to launch a raid on Scandinavia's biggest
insurer, Skandia.
Between them, UNI and Hafnia acquired a 42 per cent stake in the Swedish
company, causing uncertainty on local stock markets which hit the market
value of the shareholdings and left both companies with heavy investment
losses.
Hafnia, which owns 14.8 per cent of Skandia, suspended payments to its
creditors last August and since then has been seeking to sell off its
insurance and banking operations.
A stop-gap solution to Baltica's problems was arranged last October, when
Den Danske Bank bought 32 per cent of the shares in Baltica Insurance to
provide liquidity to Baltica.
As these problems came to a head again last week, the sale of Baltica's
insurance business to Codan, the Danish insurance company, in which the UK's
Sun Alliance holds a 70 per cent stake, was also considered.
Mr Nils Wilhjelm, chairman, said that this alternative was not as
satisfactory for Baltica Holding as the arrangement *something in here (HP)
*
that has now been made.
Yesterday's events also underlined the role of Den Danske Bank in the Danish
financial world.
As well as its shareholding in Baltica, Den Danske is owed around DKr600m by
Hafnia and is one of the group's biggest creditors.
Mr Knud Sorensen, its chief executive, says that Danske does not wish to
remain a large shareholder in Baltica in the longer term.
Even so, the bank could be one of the main beneficiaries of a deal between
Baltica and Hafnia, and appears to have played a crucial role in negotiating
yesterday's measures.
'Danske has been trying to organise a Danish solution,' said Mr Mark
Cathcart, European insurance analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton in London. 'Danske
is in the driving seat.'
The likelihood of a Danish solution was welcomed by the government
yesterday.
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, said that it was satisfactory
that the financial institutions had been able to solve the problems
themselves without involving the government.
'We have avoided a situation like that in Norway and Sweden, where the state
has had to support loss-making banks and insurance companies,' Mr Lykketoft
said.
However, market reactions were uncertain. There was little trading in
Baltica Insurance, an illiquid share, which however put on DKr40 to close at
DKr1,150.
Analysts said that the complexity of the arrangements has left them
uncertain how to price Baltica Insurance. Danske's share price fell by DKr12
to DKr304.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tenneco in restructure charge of
Dollars 920m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglomerate, yesterday announced a Dollars 920m pre-tax
restructuring charge at its troubled JI Case farm and construction equipment
business, together with an issue of common stock which could raise more than
Dollars 1.1bn.
The company filed a registration statement for an issue of 23.5m new shares,
co-led by First Boston and Lazard Freres, and said the proceeds would be
used to repay debt.
Tenneco estimated the Case restructuring, to be carried out over three
years, would require Dollars 550m in cash, though this would be reduced by
any money it realised while implementing the programme.
The company's shares dipped after the announcement but recovered to close at
Dollars 47 3/4 , down Dollars  3/8 , at the close in New York.
Case, a leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, has been a thorn in
Tenneco's side for several years, suffering from weak markets and strong
global competition. It went through a major restructuring in 1991, involving
Dollars 461m of charges for job cuts, plant closures and product line
rationalisations.
Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco, said yesterday that while these actions
had helped its performance, 'the farm and construction equipment market
continued to deteriorate and we determined that major structural and
strategic changes were necessary'.
Case is to focus more on core product lines, where it is a market leader or
could become one, including medium to large agricultural equipment and light
to medium construction equipment.
The restructuring includes Dollars 441m of cost for rationalising
production, Dollars 161m for consolidating and resizing production capacity,
Dollars 126m for discontinuing or replacing unprofitable products, Dollars
91m for selling re-tail stores and shaking up the parts distribution network
and Dollars 101m for associated costs.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Astec recovery gathers pace

<TEXT>
ASTEC (BSR), the Hong Kong-based but London-listed electronic components and
power conversion products group which is 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson of
the US, yesterday confirmed its turnround by returning to profitability for
the full year.
The Pounds 7.8m pre-tax profit for 1992 compared with a Pounds 4.8m loss in
1991 and was struck after lower net interest payments of Pounds 1.48m
(Pounds 3.41m) and a Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 2.2m) exceptional charge
resulting from the decision to close the cellular telephone business and
scale down UK manufacturing operations.
Rationalisation and restructuring costs of Pounds 5.82m in 1992 were offset
by the Pounds 5.5m profit on the sale of three non-core businesses - printed
circuit boards, travel services and the text/measurement operation - for a
total of Pounds 13.5m including Pounds 11m cash.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 273m to Pounds 251m reflecting the disposals
and closures, but on a comparable basis sales increased to Pounds 230m
(Pounds 225m).
Earnings per share of 2.15p compared to losses of 1.61p in 1991.
Despite the improvement the dividend is again omitted.
Operating profits jumped to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 800,000) reflecting
aggressive cost cutting which lifted gross margins from 20.9 per cent to
23.6 per cent.
The core power conversion business increased its sales by 4.8 per cent to
Pounds 182.5m (Pounds 174.1m), outpacing the 2.1 per cent growth in the
worldwide market and positioning Astec as the market leader.
Operating profits in the power conversion business increased from Pounds
3.39m to Pounds 9.15m.
The electronic components division returned to profitability reporting a
Pounds 465,000 operating surplus (Pounds 2.61m loss) on sales which fell
from Pounds 98.9m to Pounds 68.4m reflecting the disposals.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance slips 4% to Pounds
23.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIC Assurance, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 4 per
cent fall in total net profits for 1992 to Pounds 23.7m, from Pounds 24.7m
in the preceding year.
The shares dipped 40p to Pounds 13.03.
If last year's except-ional transfer of Pounds 4.9m from the industrial
branch is excluded, profits on life business increased from Pounds 19.5m to
Pounds 21.8m, helped by an increase in new premium income from single
premium pensions from Pounds 43.1m to Pounds 73.3m.
In the general branch, the group incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 205,000
(Pounds 2.3m).
Mr Roman Cizdyn, life insurance analyst at Smith New Court, said that he
felt the share price had been driven down thanks to over-enthusiastic buying
of small stocks in the preceding weeks.
The results were broadly in line with expectations, Mr Cizdyn said.
Earnings per share fell from 39.59p to 37.91p, but the dividend for the year
is increased by 13.6 per cent, to 33.5p, via a final of 23.35p.
The group also proposed a 2-for-1 scrip issue. Mr Brian Shaw, general
manager and actuary, said the unwieldy share price of more than Pounds 13
might deter private investors, although it would have little effect on
institutions.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Goal advances to Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOAL PETROLEUM, the oil exploration and production company, reported a 6 per
cent rise in after-tax profit to Pounds 7m for 1992 after a reduction in its
tax charge.
Mr David Boyd, managing director, said the company would be better off in
the short term from the overhaul to the Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in
last week's Budget. He said the move would contribute Pounds 5m in
additional cash flow from Goal's share in the onshore Wytch Farm development
and the Magnus field in the North Sea.
However, he said the changes would accelerate plans the company had in place
to move its exploration efforts overseas. It is looking at making a further
shift from the British to the Netherlands sector of the North Sea.
Oil production was steady at 115,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (which
includes gas). It is set to dip slightly this year and almost double in 1995
when offshore production from Wytch Farm comes on stream.
Turnover was steady at Pounds 44.2m. Earnings per share rose to 5.23p
(4.92p) and the single dividend is 1.4p (1.25p).

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fall in autumn sales hits Tay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS BEFORE tax at Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, fell 43 per
cent to Pounds 1.03m in the half year to December 31 1992 following a slump
in autumn sales.
A rise in unit sales from 357 to 409 early in the period pushed turnover up
7 per cent, from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 27.2m.
However, Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said demand collapsed in the period
covering October to December to as low as an average of 10 unit sales a
week.
January sales picked up to average levels of 38 per week, before faltering
around the beginning of March. However, figures had again picked up in the
past week.
A brighter outlook for the rest of the year, fuelled by low interest rates
and stabilising house prices, was undermined by continued narrow margins as
housebuilders maintained discount schemes to entice buyers.
The company, which in January issued a profits warning for the full year to
June 30 1993, said it did not anticipate a significant improvement in
conditions until its 1993-94 trading year.
Analysts' original profits forecasts of up to Pounds 6m pre-tax in the
current year have since been downgraded to about Pounds 3.5m.
The company said it had 4,000 plots in hand at an overall cost per plot of
about 15 per cent of present selling prices.
It said this should allow it to increase volumes and margins whenever an
upturn came.
Earnings per share were down from 5.5p to 3.04p. The interim dividend is
held at 1.2p.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Halstead jumps 15.6% to Pounds 4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing
and trailers group, yesterday reported a 15.6 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits reflecting the closure of the loss-making Belstaff garment
manufacturing operations which depressed profits in the like period a year
ago.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of December increased from
Pounds 3.44m to Pounds 3.97m on turnover down to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 28.9m)
due to discontinued activities.
Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 8.94p (7.78p).
The interim dividend is raised 11 per cent to 2.5p (2.25p adjusted for the
1-for-1 scrip issue in December).
Commenting upon the results Mr Vincent Clare, chairman, noted that although
turnover declined and trading conditions remained 'very difficult', James
Halstead, Phoenix Distribution and Driza-Bone all generated increased sales
for the period.
Halstead, the core floor-coverings business, maintained profits despite
stiff competition while both Driza-Bone, the Australian weatherproof
clothing business, and Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories distributor,
generated increased profits.
Due to seasonal factors, both the Conway trailer tent business and the
associated Kingway business in France incurred a first-half loss as usual,
although the deficit was somewhat higher than usual because of recession.
The group added that the Belstaff closure had been completed and the costs
were within the provisions made in last year's accounts.
For the first time the company has produced balance sheet figures at the
interim stage.
These showed new borrowings of Pounds 5.17m at the end of December, incurred
in Australia as part of a hedging strategy.
Net cash amounted to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 6.9m).

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Persimmon sees signs of land price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAND PRICES are showing signs of hardening in response to the recent sharp
rise in house sales, according to Persimmon which yesterday raised Pounds
10.56m from a share placing.
The group said it needed the cash to finance land acquisition following
several large purchases completed recently.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'There are indications that land prices
are starting to increase in one or two instances. It is important to make
purchases early in case the market takes off.'
The company is placing 4.6m shares at 230p.
The share price slipped 1p to 233p following the announcement.
Persimmon earlier this month said that it intended to finance most of its
land purchases by raising borrowings rather than equity. Mr Davidson said
that this remained the intention.
The placing represented less than 5 per cent of the equity. It had been made
because several opportunities to buy sites had become available.

Guiness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, the New

The sale follows talks with the Takeover Panel. GPG had inadvertently
acquired a total percentage of voting rights in BS totalling 30.02 per cent.
The panel has confirmed that the purchase through 30 per cent of the voting
rights was an inadvertent mistake and that following the disposal no Rule 9
obligation will result. GPG now owns 4.8m ordinary BS shares, or 29.99 per
cent of the voting rights.

Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance group, saw pre-tax profits leap
89 per cent over the 12 months to December 31.
Directors attributed the rise - from IPounds 8.25 to IPounds 15.6m (Pounds
16.1m) - to improved non-life underwriting results both in Ireland and the
UK and 'exceptionally higher' investment income in Ireland.
The life side showed new annual premiums ahead 47 per cent to IPounds 7.3m,
but single premium sales dipped 28 per cent, to IPounds 15.6m.
Shareholders' funds at the year-end were marginally up at IPounds 72.4m
(IPounds 72.2m).
The proposed final dividend is 4.1p, bringing the total for the year to 6.2p
(5.7p), covered 3.2 times by earnings of 19.9p (10.2p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Debbie Moore is to restructure Pineapple, the fitness and fashion
retailing group she took private in 1988 after a short but spectacular stock
market career.
Three London clothes stores have been closed and Pineapple Ltd, one of the
subsidiaries, will cease trading, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs out of
150.
Ms Moore blamed the closures on bad trading conditions together with high
rents and interest rates.
She said the rest of the group, consisting of 26 retailing concessions, two
dance studios, fashion design and cosmetics, will be unaffected.
The Pineapple group is believed to be loss-making; turnover totals about
Pounds 5m.

SHARPE &amp; Fisher, the building supplies and property group, returned profits
of Pounds 1.45m pre-tax for 1992, a sharp improvement on the previous year's
restated Pounds 452,000.
The shares responded with a 12p rise to 95p.
Tight control on costs together with a reduction in bad debts enabled the
building supplies division to swing from losses of Pounds 139,000 to profits
of Pounds 1.22m.
However, the contribution from property fell from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds

Overall turnover edged ahead from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 45.3m.
An unchanged final dividend of 2.5p holds the total at 4p from earnings more

The Pelican group of restaurants is set to buy four London restaurants owned
by Mr Robert Earl, the entrepreneur.
The Stock Exchange forced Pelican to admit it is in talks following a rise
in the share price. The shares rose some 17 per cent to 54p yesterday.
The deal would mean a seat on Pelican's board for Mr Earl.
It would also roughly double the size of the 17-restaurant-strong Pelican

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delay on E&amp;A scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME of arrangement between English &amp; American, the London market
insurance company, and its creditors could take at least a year to
negotiate, according to Mr Tony McMahon of KPMG Peat Marwick, the
provisional liquidators.
Mr McMahon said the company had been hit by a rise in 'attritional' claims
on its marine book. Underwriters said last year that a rise in marine cargo
claims had caused a downturn in the company's fortunes. More recently it has
been forced to build up reserves against future marine liability claims.
E&amp;A's other insurance businesses, which include a run-off and insurance
management company, are unaffected by the developments.
Meanwhile, provisional liquidators of Trinity Insurance, another UK company
seeking to negotiate a scheme of arrangement, announced yesterday that the
scheme had been sanctioned in the courts. Mr Richard Boys-Stones and Mr
Colin Bird of Price Waterhouse have been appointed as scheme administrators.

Wellcome, the UK drugs group, received recommendation on Saturday for its
Lamictal epileptic treatment from a specialist committee of the US Food and

Lamictal is one of Wellcome's most promising new compounds which the company
believes could eventually generate significant revenues.
Analysts expect the drug, currently licensed in only 10 countries, to
generate sales of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m by 1995. The worldwide
epileptic market, which mainly consists of generic low-price medicines, is
worth between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m a year.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Suter dips to Pounds 16.3m after European
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTER, the conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, yesterday blamed
recession for lower sales and revealed a fall in profits for last year.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 16.3m in the 12 months to
December 31. At the interim stage, profits were ahead 2 per cent at Pounds
9.4m.
Mr Abell said trading conditions had been 'extremely difficult' and sales to
continental Europe, especially France, declined rapidly towards the year
end.
The distribution division, which includes refrigeration and hair care sales,
saw trading profits fall 30 per cent to Pounds 4.5m.
Chemicals increased profits 19 per cent to Pounds 7.5m and benefited from
improved productivity.
In the industrial division, lower environmental sales were almost balanced
by an improved performance from automotive components, partly due to work
with the new Ford Mondeo.
Mr Abell refused to comment on Suter's ambitions towards engineering company
James Wilkes, in which Suter now holds 10.1 per cent.
Neither would he talk about a possible libel claim against Channel 4. The
action was delayed pending publication of the DTI investigation into share
dealings by Mr Abell and Suter.
The report found no evidence these and other parties acted in concert, but
strongly criticised some of Mr Abell's actions.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 7.7m), incurred on
writing down the value to zero of Hartons, a loss-making plastics
distributor where Suter holds 22 per cent. Suter said adopting FRS 3 was
inappropriate, but confirmed that earnings would have been lower because the
extraordinary would be treated as an exceptional.
Earnings fell to 9.6p (10.5p). A recommended maintained final dividend of
5.6p makes an unchanged total of 8.8p. A scrip issue of one warrant for
every 10 ordinary shares held is also proposed.
COMMENT
It is almost a year since Mr Abell promised 'radical action', presumably
through disposals, to improve Suter's share price. Yet nothing has been
done. The shares are still languishing and yesterday fell 10p to 144p,
mainly because of a downbeat trading statement. Shareholders have little
else to celebrate either. Despite the criticisms of the DTI report, Mr Abell
appears to have shunned all advice to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive, and some of his unusual powers - for example being allowed to buy
up to 15 per cent of a company without main board approval - remain in
place. Full year profits are forecast at Pounds 19m, putting the shares on
12 times. While the only excitement on the horizon is the unexciting
prospect of a bid for Wilkes, the shares remain unattractive.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Aitken out of US with Dollars 54m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AITKEN HUME International, the financial services and banking group, is to
pull out of the US market with the sale of its fund management business for
a maximum consideration of Dollars 54m (Pounds 38m).
The group, which in 1989 sold all but three of its diverse businesses in an
effort to stem losses, is left with just its private banking operations in
London and Guernsey.
Mr Ziad Idilby, chairman, said the group had not yet decided how it would
use the proceeds from the sale of National Securities &amp; Research
Corporation.
However, a statement issued yesterday said the group did not intend to use
the proceeds for acquisitions or expansion of existing businesses.
The sale price represented a significant increase over the Dollars 30m-plus
paid for the fund management business by Aitken in the early 1980s, Mr
Idilby said. 'It was more or less an offer we could not refuse.' The
disposal was the result of several approaches, either for NSR alone or for
Aitken Hume as a whole, received in recent months.
Aitken finally agreed to sell NSR - which manages some Dollars 2.7bn in
assets - to Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance. Last year NSR contributed
pre-tax profits of Dollars 4m on total income of Dollars 17.8m.
The deal bars Aitken from competing against Phoenix in the US mutual funds
industry.
A total of Dollars 14.8m will be held in escrow pending settlement of
certain outstanding issues. Mr Idilby added that the net asset value of the
group would be 67p a share after the disposal.

FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rutland associate doubles to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUTLAND TRUST, the financial services and property surveying group,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.66m for the year to December
31.
That compared with a Pounds 6.75m loss in 1991 as restated to comply with
new accounting rules.
However, attention was focused on Rutland's plans for Capital Industries,
its 44 per cent-owned associate, which announced pre-tax profits almost
doubled at Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 1.29m). Shares in Capital Industries, a
financial services and industrial group, fell 10p on the day to 228p
Capital Industries' profitability reflected the effect of sterling's
devaluation and the acquisition of Samuel Jones, which exports more than 50
per cent of its laminated paper products, for Pounds 7m last October.
The acquisition was funded by an Pounds 8.74m rights issue. Samuel Jones'
high borrowings inflated interest payments to Pounds 322,000 compared with
Pounds 62,000 of interest received in 1991. Borrowings have fallen since the
purchase of Samuel Jones with gearing down from 75 per cent to 63 per cent.
Capital Industries took an exceptional charge of Pounds 214,000 arising from
the sale of loss-making polythene bag and bar accessories subsidiaries.
Earnings rose to 11.8p (8.5p) and a final dividend of 2.4p gives a 4p (2p)
total. A 1-for-4 scrip issue is also proposed.
Rutland's 1991 loss reflected a net loss on disposal of Technology Group and
Property Enterprise Managers of Pounds 4.03m and Pounds 10.9m of goodwill
originally written off to reserves which must now be shown on the profit and
loss account on disposal. Pre-tax profits on continuing operations were
Pounds 7.06m in 1991.
Turnover decreased to Pounds 93.9m (Pounds 94.6m). Earnings per share rose
to 1.68p (re-stated losses per share of 4.05p). Earnings per share on
continuing operations were 1.57p.
The board proposes a maintained final dividend of 0.53p giving an unchanged
total of 0.8p.

Challenge for company culture - Business re-engineering: the need for
'totally new thinking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER a decade ago, in 'Information Technology Year,' Kenneth Baker toured
the UK exhorting businesses to automate and change the entire way they
operated to increase productivity and gain new market opportunities.
The story goes that after one such speech in 1982 he was approached by a
small businessman who said: 'I'm so fired up by what you said that I'm going
straight out to buy an electric typewriter]'
Eleven years later this story is all too familiar to proponents of business
process re-engineering or any of the 20 other names for this idea which were
discovered in a recent survey.
'Companies are spending millions of pounds on applying information
technology to business processes which are donkey's years old and are
irrelevant to today's needs,' says Mr John Bennett, an executive director at
computing company ICL.
'Advances in technology mean that companies are enjoying huge improvements
in cost-performance of computers. Businesses have extensive telecom networks
and easily accessible databases. Yet despite the advances and the massive
investment in technology, office productivity has barely increased in the
last dozen years and in many cases has actually decreased,' he says.
Mr Bennett believes no more than five per cent of ICL customers are
seriously working on business re-engineering.
Mr David Harvey, a director of research firm Business Intelligence, which
recently published a 300-page report on business re-engineering*, says
information technology itself is part of the problem.
MOST businesses claim they are 'geared to constant change,' he says. 'But
too often the change is the wrong kind: the kind that props up a creaking
management process or functional structure and keeps it going for a few more
years, rather than replacing it with a system which works and is suited to
current needs. The result is management systems of growing complexity and
overhead.'
Information technology has been part of the problem, he says - 'as
administrative systems have grown in complexity, IT has been used to help
manage that complexity.'
Today's quest for more competitive companies with fewer layers of management
and administration has made business re-engineering a hot topic in the
1990s. An annual survey of senior executives in Europe by the consultancy
CSC Index found that this issue entered 'the top 20' at 17 in 1989 and
jumped to number one in 1990, staying in the top three since then.
Business re-engineering, according to the Business Intelligence report, is
the transformation of a company from one based on functions, such as
accounting, marketing and manufacturing, to one based on processes, such as
order processing and fulfilling customer expectations.
The study highlights the restrictions of traditional structures. Each
department focuses on what it contributes, not on what is needed as a whole.
There is competition between functions, for example for budgets and staff.
Staff identify with their function, rather than with the company as a whole.
There are barriers to co-operation between functions, and sometimes even
conflict. And a structure based on functions generates its own bureaucracy,
which is needed to co-ordinate work and the flow of documents between the
functions.
'Re-engineering challenges the underlying values and culture of a company,'
the report says. 'All the components of a company could be affected, because
re-engineering takes a holistic approach. Everything that affects outcomes -
organisation, processes, people, technologies - must be considered for
change.'
Mr Christopher Bell, a business re-engineering specialist at Andersen
Consulting, goes further: 'Question everything: there are no sacred cows,'
he says. 'Set dramatic targets and think of dramatic ways of reaching them.'
All this is a considerable challenge and there can be no textbook approach.
Christopher Bell underlines the need for totally new thinking when looking
at re-engineering.
'Go wild with ideas,' he says. 'Look at brain-storming meetings, suggestion
boxes, workshops, industry 'best practice,' confession meetings,
consultants, focus groups: any technique to generate new ideas to do things
differently.'
Even so, it is worth identifying specific areas which are ripe for
re-engineering - and the resultant re-engineering need not be too
earth-shattering. Rank Xerox, for example, cut the time to bill special
contracts from more than three months to just one day, largely by
simplifying the flow of documents around the company. This was part of a
wider corporate re-engineering in the UK.
Christopher Bell at Andersen Consulting and David Harvey at Business
Intelligence emphasise activities which focus on customers and the quality
of products and services delivered to them.
Mr Harvey points to the typical arrangement where a customer enquiry at a
branch generates a request for information to a particular department, which
sends back the reply, which generates a further enquiry based on the
information, so that enquiry goes to another department and so on.
A variation on this theme is when too many staff in different departments
deal with the same customer or supplier.
THE Business Intelligence research highlights IT as key to business
re-engineering. Others agree. At the simplest level, IT enables departments
to share information through an on-line database, breaking down barriers and
jealously guarded departmental ownership of data.
Electronic data interchange, the exchange of orders, invoices and sales
forecasts between computers, is transforming relationships between trading
partners and eliminating paper-handling. And often such systems will just be
the starting point for business re-engineering.
'The IT function must no longer be seen as the unit which mulls over whether
the company should go for the Unix operating system,' says John Bennett at
ICL. 'The emphasis now must be on how the function can play its part in the
future of the enterprise.'
David Harvey at Business Intelligence agrees: 'The relationship between IT
and the rest of the company must be completely different from that of the
past. In the past it has been a stand-alone department, often detached from
business thinking. It must now be part of the team which helps shape the
business re-engineering programme.'
He adds: 'The IT director should be more pro-active. Senior executives are
unable to think of their business and processes in terms of anything more
than today's - and probably yesterday's - technologies, because they are not
told how new technologies can make possible what has previously been
impossible.
'Whose fault is this? If the buck does not stop with the IT director, it is
hard to think where it should stop.'

Force for radical change - Software: object-oriented technology will lead to
upheavals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE abstract and esoteric world of computer software shares one thing in
common with the real world; it has the equivalent of an 'ecology.' And, like
the real world, the structure of this ecology is subject to changes and
shifts as a result of external pressures. Advances in hardware technology,
increased user-demand and straightforward improvements in software itself
have come together to create a force for radical change in the ecology of
the software world in the last few years. Experts talk of 'paradigm shifts'
and 'revolutions.'
At the heart of this upheaval is a new way of thinking about information
technology called object-oriented technology. It aims to define a new
approach to the design and construction of information systems and the
software which supports them.
The ecology of the software world defines the relationships between the
building blocks of modern computer systems. It includes everything from the
basic operating software, which controls the internal workings of the
system, to the graphics-based 'front end' interface which the user sees.
Traditionally, these components have been closely tied to each other,
overlapped in their functionality and been mainly concerned with internal
technology issues such as performance and system efficiency.
By contrast, the object-oriented approach aims to separate software into a
set of components according to their function and define ways in which they
can talk to each other.
Traditional engineering provides an analogy. Engineers see a motor vehicle,
a washing machine or, for that matter, a computer system, as a series of
components which are connected together to create the finished product. Each
of the components - a motor, an electronic controller, and so on - has a
pre-defined function and standard links to connect it to other components.
SYSTEMS designers and software engineers can use the object-oriented
approach in the same way to re-define the ecology of computer software.
Object-oriented also introduces several new ideas to thinking about computer
software. Objects can, for example, be 're-used' in other applications. New
objects can be created easily from existing objects. As a result, it
promises to improve programmer productivity and make long-term maintenance
easier.
Object-oriented technology is gaining ground - both among suppliers, which
see it as an opportunity to expand the scope of information technology
products, and among users who see it as a better way to solve their
information processing problems.
UK market research company Ovum forecasts staggering growth in the market
for object-oriented technology between now and 1997. Last year the combined
US/European market for object-oriented software - including development
tools, languages and databases - was worth Dollars 865m. This will rise to
over Dollars 4bn by 1997 and, although the annual growth rate will have
fallen back from its current high of 69 per cent, it will still stand at 27
per cent a year.
The rush to move into object-oriented technology is confirmed by other
sources. The Object Management Group (OMG), an organisation founded in 1989
to promote the cause, reports that the embryonic US market for
object-oriented databases grew from Dollars 18m in 1991 to Dollars 60m last
year.
Mr Christopher Stone, president of OMG, says: 'Compared with the early
growth rates for relational database technology about ten years ago - this
represents a high early acceptance of object-oriented systems.'
The level of interest is also reflected in the growth of the OMG itself. It
now has over 300 members, including all of the leading hardware and software
companies from IBM to Microsoft. Mr Stone also reports an upsurge of
interest from user organisations.
This year, there are three big conference/exhibitions taking place in the UK
alone - including the OMG-sponsored Objectworld. This level of interest is
reflected throughout Europe and the US.
There is good cause for this strong interest in object-oriented technology.
It promises to change the ecology of software for the better and correct
many mistakes of the past.
Mr Steven Cook, managing director of the UK object-oriented software
specialist Object Designers, sees the level of interest moving from the
exploratory to the pragmatic: 'We founded our company to help large users
make strategic long-term decisions about object-oriented technology. Their
position has shifted noticeably from asking what it is to asking how it can
be done.'
MR COOK is the chairman of the Object Technology 93 conference in Cambridge
at the end of March and notes that prospective attendees are asking
practical questions: 'Object technology is obviously going to effect the
whole ecology of software and applications. Users want to know what is going
to happen.'
'There is a stage when the penny drops and people start to realize how
powerful object technology can be,' explains Paul Fitzgibbon, marketing
director with UK software company Protek.
Some users are already building systems using the object-oriented approach.
Kredietbank in Belgium has started a pilot project to analyse balance sheets
using the approach. It uses Hitachi's Object IQ development package running
on a network of Hewlett Packard computers.
'We chose ObjectIQ - not for its object-oriented capabilities but its
rule-processing features,' explains Dr Marc de Brabanter, head of
Kredietbank's research and development team.
'We've long-term plans to use more object-oriented techniques - but these
are driven by the business. The tools we want just happen to be
object-oriented,' Dr De Brabanter adds.
Few users have reached this stage of course. But with the growing bandwagon
and the inevitable surge in marketing hype, it will not be long before users
will have to take account of the new ecology for software.

Bridge between east and west - The new Nordic-Russian telecommunications
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LINDSAY NICOLLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMANS may have pulled down the Berlin Wall but it is telecommunications
that is now building the bridge between east and west.
'We hope to overcome the communications barriers between east and west and
make it possible for companies in eastern Europe to work in the western
way,' explains Mr Tapio Paarma, head of an international project to build
and run advanced mobile telephone and data communications services in the
key commercial centre of St Petersburg and its surrounding area.
The service will open up international communications for the 200-300
western companies which have already moved into St Petersburg, such as
Barclays Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche Bank and Western hotel and
restaurant chains.
The service has gone live for voice but it will be two to three years before
the full data telecommunications network is complete. Mr Paarma expects to
have 100,000 subscribers by 1998.
Russia needs to catch up quickly in telecommunications: its services are
currently based on antiquated telephone exchanges with inadequate capacity.
ADVANCED western mobile technology is considered the quickest and most
cost-effective way of updating Russia's communications while maintaining
some level of service. Radio communications are regarded worldwide as the
natural successor to traditional fixed-link communications in the longer
term.
'The Russians are learning English very quickly and are extremely keen to
understand western telecom technology,' says Mr Carl-Fredrik Geust, Russia
area director of Telecom Finland, which is leading the consortium running
the St Petersburg project.
'They already have the western way of thinking about market economics: St
Petersburg is one big flea market with street-buying and selling. They just
need the telecommunications infrastructure to express it.'
The advanced technology being adopted is the Global System for Mobile
Communication. GSM is a 1980s Scandinavian vision of a pan-European mobile
telecommunications network based on digital technology which already
provides stable voice services and will handle data in the near future.
Data can already be sent on analogue mobile systems but such systems are not
reliable enough. The sender must be stationary and have a good radio path to
the receiving base station - small electrical cabinets which operate
unattended. The base station relays the data to the telephone exchange.
With digital GSM, data transmission will be much easier and safer. The
laptop computer of the future will have an inbuilt GSM mobile station and a
rod aerial at the side. The sender will dial the destination using the
keyboard. A computer-controlled digital exchange will identify the sender
from its database and route the call and its bill simultaneously.
St Petersburg is a key centre in the total Russian network. It has been the
gateway to Russia since the time of Peter the Great and is one of the most
advanced ex-communist cities in terms of western business development. Its
proximity to Russia's only north-west seaboard guarantees its future
commercial success if its telecommunications infrastructure can be
overhauled.
Telecom Finland's Nordic-Russian consortium that has been awarded the
licence to operate the telecom service in this area includes Swedish Telecom
International and Norwegian Telecom, plus the St Petersburg Trunk Line
Exchange and Leningrad Regional Posts and Telecommunications Administration
(which still prefers the old Communist name for the city).
The consortium won the contract in January against stiff opposition from US
and European telecom groups.
The total cost of the network has been estimated at USDollars 160m. Funding
is expected to come from international telecom operators and banks and from
aid organisations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Telecom equipment manufacturers around the world will hear shortly which of
them have been chosen to provide the bulk of the technology, while the
Russians will donate their local expertise and exchange equipment, masts and
antennae.
An optical fibre cable between Helsinki and St Petersburg will carry the GSM
and old analogue traffic when it passes tests now being carried out. It will
provide unlimited transmission capacity compared to the current 64 kilobits
which carries international telephone connections and packet switched data
services, thanks to another Finnish-Russian venture.
When the Russians elected last year to grant 12 GSM licences to companies to
develop GSM networks, Nordic operators were high on the list because they
have much experience of developing communications to remote and inaccessible
regions.
Finland is ideally situated next to its friendly Russian neighbours. The St
Petersburg GSM area is only 150 kilometres from the Finnish border. The
entire Finnish population of 5m is less than the 7.5m potential subscribers
in the St Petersburg area alone.
Some say this last factor - relative size - influenced the Russians not to
award the vital St Petersburg licence to US telecom giant US West
International, which won eight of the other licences and the responsibility
for GSM co-ordination across Russia. St Petersburg, they say, is 'too key a
commercial area to trust to the Americans.'
Such Cold War memories are mutual. Western security services are currently
scrutinising GSM networks to ensure that inbuilt encryption techniques are
not so good that they render the networks untappable. They have the
authority to ban the export of highly secure GSM equipment to 'enemy' states
if they choose.
But Mr Geust at Telecom Finland does not think the security issue will deter
business take-up of GSM: 'I'm sure that regardless of what encryption
algorithms are inherent in the system, organisations such as banks will
probably have their own encryption equipment at both ends of the network:
no-one trusts outside equipment anyway.'
ANOTHER unresolved issue shadowing the progress of GSM worldwide and
separating the US from the Europeans is the choice of digital technology.
For global mobile telephony and data transmission to work, clearly everyone
ought to agree on a standard technology. Wisely, equipment manufacturers are
developing systems to suit both camps. They already have their eye on the
GSM replacement, the futuristic Universal Mobile Telecommunications System.
Meanwhile the St Petersburg partners' first aim is to get the initial
service fully live. Even so, they are already looking to exploit the data
service to the full.
'There is now pressure from the international market and especially from the
Russians to have improved voice and high-speed data transmission,' says Mr
Geust. 'Database access, the transmission of high resolution pictures and
graphics - these are our next challenges.'

Threshold of new digital era - Mobile Telephony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past decade, analogue cellular radio networks have ushered in the
age of the mobile telephone, but now their digital counterparts promise a
new range of sophisticated voice and data services.
EMCI, the Washington-based market research organisation, has forecast that
by 1996 there will be about 13m digital cellular subscribers worldwide,
accounting for about a quarter of the total cellular market.
The mobile telecommunications revolution began in the US in with radio
technology providing the means to free the telephone from the tyranny of the
telegraph pole and fixed-wire connection.
In Europe, Britain led the way with telecommunications liberalisation
measures which ushered in the first cellular radio services in 1985.
Growth rates in the UK have slowed in recent years, however the number of
subscribers to the two national networks, Cellnet and Vodafone, grew by
about 13.5 per cent last year to around 1.4m - or almost a quarter of the
5.98m users in Europe.
Although the vast majority of these subscribers are business users, both UK
network operators have recently attempted to broaden the subscriber-base by
launching low-user tariffs and services designed to make their existing
analogue networks more appealing to a wider audience.
These new analogue tariff structures have been introduced at the same time
as a raft of new digital services is being rolled out across Europe. Some of
these new services are likely to appeal to business customers willing to pay
premium prices for flexible high quality voice and data communications,
while others are designed to generate a real mass market for mobile
communications.
Most immediate interest is focused on the introduction of digital services
based on the pan-European GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile) standard.
Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries are committed to building
GSM networks, and another 20 countries around the world have adopted GSM as
the basis for the next generation of digital cellular services.
The first GSM networks were launched last summer in Germany, France and
Denmark, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe.
In Germany, which lagged behind in the introduction of cellular radio, the
launch of competing GSM networks last year has al ready generated strong
subscriber interest.
Meanwhile in the UK Cellnet plans to launch a commercial GSM network next
year while Vodafone launched a limited network in December and plans to have
90 per cent of its system in place by the middle of this year.
These new premium-priced digital services will not replace the older
analogue networks immediately. Indeed, it will be some time before many full
national networks are in place and even then the existing network operators
believe there will be a slow and gradual migration to digital services.
However, for the business traveller in particular, they should offer some
key advantages. Among these, digital services provide clearer more reliable
connections which are also much more secure. By the mid 1990s, because it is
a Europe-wide standard, international travellers will be able to use their
GSM phones - and their GSM microchip-controlled 'smart' phone cards -
anywhere in Europe.
The GSM standard offers another important advantage over its analogue
counterparts - it includes a mobile data facility, This will enable mobile
terminals, like portable computers and fax machines, to communicate at
speeds comparable to the best of today's fixed telephone data links. It is
also compatible with the emerging integrated services digital network, or
ISDN.
GSM telephones equipped with small LCD screens will also be able to receive
messages like pagers. Thus GSM may bring the long-awaited digital mobile
office a step closer to reality.
In the UK, Vodafone plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM
called the Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a low-cost digital
portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers.
Local MCN call charges are expected to be significantly cheaper than GSM
services putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone
networks.
MCN is due to be launched in the south-east of England later this year in
direct competition with another digital system aimed at the mass market
called the personal communications network (PCN).
When the UK government invited applications for PCN licenses in 1989,
companies rushed to apply, buoyed by predictions of 10m customers by the end
of the decade, and the belief subscribers would swap their ordinary phones
for PCN's pocket-sized high frequency personal handsets.
Since then, the recession and the need for the very heavy investment of
around Pounds 1bn needed to build a PCN network has frightened away many of
the prospective market players.
Nevertheless, Mercury Personal Communications is pressing ahead with the
launch of its PCN service later this year, while Microtel, a joint-venture
involving Hutchison Telecom and British Aerospace, is believed to be looking
for another partner to share the cost of its planned PCN service.
Elsewhere in Europe, PCN networks are likely to be built in Germany and
perhaps France. Some countries have also licensed call-only Telepoint
services, such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK.
This proliferation of analogue and digital networks, services and tariff
packages will provide considerable customer choice, but may also lead to
confusion.
The disappointing uptake of other recently introduced radio based services,
like public access mobile radio and mobile data services has already been
blamed on customer confusion.
Mobile data in particular has so far failed to live up to early
expectations. Despite this, Mr Martin Bartholomew who is in charge of
Mercury Communications Mobile Services (MCMS), an independent service
provider, estimates that there are now between 60,000 and 70,000 mobile data
subscribers in the UK and that this will rise to around 100,000 next year.
'It is part of the range of services that the larger service providers will
offer as part of the mobile solution,' he says.
The service providers do indeed have a key advisory role to play. Currently
there are mobile data services offered by the cellular operators, dedicated
mobile data networks, and data over private mobile radio networks - all
using incompatible standards and equipment.
Transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is considerably more
difficult than over the public switched telephone network.
One solution is to build the necessary specialist electronics into dedicated
equipment or use a special cellular modem.
Vodafone's mobile data service, which claims several thousand users and 90
per cent of the UK market, uses a special cellular data link control modem
to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the
Vodafone cellular network which provides automatic standards conversion.

Reducing the paper mountains - The Electronic Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when you thought it was safe to joke about the 'paperless office,' the
convergence of a number of technologies is making it possible.
Early attempts at the paperless office failed because no matter how many
computers a company bought, paper kept arriving in the post.
But now a number of companies are starting to store both incoming mail and
computer files electronically. They include Nirex, the UK company tasked
with finding long-term storage for Britain's nuclear waste, IBM systems
house Triangle Computers and the mortgage department of Barclays Bank.
Later this month, scientists at Nirex will receive all their post
electronically. The contents of their filing cabinets are also being turned
into electronic files. So in future when they need information, they will be
able to use a database (a computer-based library) to retrieve all the
information available, whether it be letters, in house reports or external
research.
No-one wants a nuclear waste repository nearby and Nirex's ability to
respond quickly and efficiently to questions about safety could determine
the success or failure of its plan to site the repository at Sellafield.
The idea is that the system will provide a single-source of information,
both for office work and for operational tasks, such as construction and
maintenance. It will be one of the first systems to do this.
Yusef Eisa, the company's new information technology (IT) director, says:
'The data contained in the system will constitute the corporate memory and
is therefore an important asset. Information on the nuclear waste repository
will have to be kept indefinitely because future generations may need to
look at it.'
Nirex's system (called Fred - for Fast Retrieval Electronic Database)
illustrates the way different technologies are coming together. It is a
combination of established and emerging tools combined in a new way by two
UK-based suppliers: image processing company Trimco and free-text specialist
Kinesis.
The tools include:
Traditional office automation products, such as wordprocessing and
electronic mail.
Personal computers (PCs) connected by a network.
Image processing. This enables paper documents (including any
signatures/graphics) to be turned into electronic images, which can be
displayed on a computer screen.
Optical character read (OCR) technology. This is being used to 'read'
electronic images (which can't be altered) and turn them into computer
files, which can be edited.
Structured and free-text databases. Structured databases allow users to look
for specific information, such as everything received on a particular date,
or written by a particular person. Free-text databases are useful for
retrieving everything written about a specific topic, eg'reprocessing
plants.'
Workflow software. This helps to route information automatically between
workers involved in a common process and improve the information flow.
High-quality graphics and computer-aided design software. This will enable
engineering drawings, designs and maps (for both construction and planned
maintenance) to be included in the second phase of the project.
Groupware software (which supports team work). For example, Nirex plans to
use 'red-lining' - a form of shared editing - to underline and add margin
notes to online reports and drawings which have to be approved by several
people.
How it works
Paper-based information, such as a letter, will be scanned into the new
system. An electronic image of the letter will appear on a large screen in
the mailroom. Then the post clerk will key basic details about the letter
(such as date, author of letter, and addressee) into an Oracle database
index.
The image will then be sent to a queue on a Sun workstation. From there, OCR
software will produce a text file of the image. The image and its associated
text file will then be forwarded to a specific department, where further
words will be typed into a structured index.
Finally, the image of the letter will be stored on an optical disk and the
text version will be loaded into the BRS/Search database.
In the second phase of the project, it will also be possible to load
wordprocessed documents into the free-text database very easily. And to link
them with other files. For example, an outgoing letter might be linked with
an incoming letter. The idea is that when a user carries out either a
structured or a free-text search, he/she will get as full an answer as
possible. If a structured search does not retrieve the information required,
the user can try a free-text search - or vice versa. In addition to database
searches, users will be able to send each other images via electronic mail.
Groupware benefits
However, Nirex's approach is not the only way of reducing the paper
mountain. According to Roger Whitehead, editor of the Groupware News
newsletter: 'Many different combinations of old-fashioned office automation
and new-fangled groupware products can support new ways of office working.
They can help conquer the boundaries of time and space, enabling people who
are normally separated by different time zones or different locations to
work together on the same project.' Typical groupware applications include
workflow; shared editing systems; group decision support; and conferencing
and information management.
For example, last month Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch multinational decided to
use Lotus Notes (one of the best-known groupware products) to break down
communications barriers between its international offices. Notes provides
information management as well as information distribution and can be used
to exchange graphics, photographs, figures and text.
Unilever expects to have over 10,000 Notes users. Mike Johnson, worldwide
head of IT at Unilever, says it will be used to 'support team-working, and
the sharing of information from desk-to-desk, worldwide.'
This will reduce the paper flow. But Triangle Computers, a Notes reseller,
has decided to dispense with paper altogether. Every piece of information
that comes into the company, gets scanned into Notes and thrown away.
Douglas Drysdale, the company's technical director, says: 'People are
basically lazy. They make better use of information if it is at their
fingertips, rather than a short walk away in a filing cabinet. In the end,
it boils down to efficiency.'
For some, reducing the paper mountain can open up new business
opportunities. Barclays Bank's Intermortgage division has started to use
Filenet imaging technology to convert its mortgage correspondence files into
electronic documents. This has speeded up the time taken to approve mortgage
applications and cut costs. Before long, it plans to process all loans
electronically.
Gordon Charlesworth, who is responsible for image processing at the division
says: 'In the third and fourth quarter of this year, we will start scanning
all the post that arrives in the mail room in to the image processing
system. This will be phased in a department at a time.'
As the division's processing costs have fallen, it has started to attract
business processing mortgages for other lenders. It hopes to win more
business of this kind in future.
Changes in technology could mean that the paperless office becomes less of a
laughing matter and more of a serious competitive advantage.

Faster and cheaper data links - Wide Area Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDE area networks (WANs), using high-speed private or public
telecommunications lines, are common among large organisations needing an
efficient and cheap method of information exchange between head office and
branches.
There are various means of achieving the links using multiplexers, modems
and packet switched technologies. The transport mechanisms used by most
companies requiring a degree of information security are leased circuits
from Mercury or BT (eg KiloStream or MegaStream) for point-to-point
connections or X25 for multi-site connections.
Choice is largely dependent on distance between the various sites, traffic
volumes and data transfer rates needed. However, with downsizing driving the
move towards multiple LANs and distributed computing, it is unlikely that
the traditional WAN will be able to cope.
Increasingly, computer-users need to be able to work on collaborative
projects and communicate with colleagues as easily as if they were sitting
at the next desk, no matter where they are located and no matter how many
network gateways, bridges and servers they have to be routed through.
Interconnection with seamless, real-time inter-operability are key.
The Enterprise Wide Network (EWN) of tomorrow will, then, need to be based
on high-speed transport mechanisms capable of providing the aggregate
network bandwidth required for increasingly popular workgroup applications
such as CAD/CAM and real-time full-colour multimedia, as well as corporate
workflow applications such as video-conferencing, multiple messaging
services and EDI (electronic data interchange).
That data communications will increase for most organisations there appears
no doubt. This is highlighted by a report published by network specialists
3Com, entitled The Myth of the Global Village, which shows that 81 per cent
of companies expect their data communications across Europe will increase
over the next 12 months, with 20 per cent expecting an increase of over 100
per cent.
Tom Plimmer, managing director of 3Com UK notes: 'Few have the network
infrastructure capable of supporting that expansion. Very soon, companies
will find themselves facing unforeseen and therefore unmanageable and very
costly network growth.'
The answer?
'Rather than be overwhelmed and held back by over complex implementations,
they will need to form new partnerships with (networking) suppliers and
integrators,' he says.
Don Parry, manager of customer systems, Mercury Communications, agrees: 'It
is even more important now that integrated voice and data solutions are, at
last, deliverable. The WAN marketplace has been very fragmented, with some
market leaders going through some disturbing periods of instability.
'What customers need to do is follow the example of organisations like BT
and Mercury and look for partners with a solid foundation they can have
confidence in, can understand their business aspirations and can offer
flexible, standards compliant solutions.'
IF the Enterprise Wide Network is set to become the central nervous system
without which no corporate body will be able to function nor grow, what are
the standards-compliant, multiplexed broadband solutions of the future?
Most R&amp;D investment, it seems, is being directed towards Frame Relay, ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). Market
research organisation, Frost &amp; Sullivan, believes that it is these more
robust OSI (Opens Systems Interconnect) standards, when finalised, that will
take market share from currently available but functionally limited
standards like TCP/IP (Transaction Control Program/Internet Protocol) and
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
According to a new Frost &amp; Sullivan report,* fast packet switching, as it is
generically known, is forecast to rise in value from USDollars 74m in 1992
to more than USDollars 2bn by the end of 1997. Within that period, shipments
of frame relay are set to treble from the current value of USDollars 166.5m.
Because of its ability to switch both voice, data, image and video, analysts
forecast that the European market for ATM/cell relay technology will grow
even more dramatically, rising from USDollars 51m in 1992 to over USDollars
1.17bn by 1997.
Frame relay is ideal for complex, geographically dispersed networks. Based
on Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) standards, frame relay enables WAN
managers to consolidate traffic from multiple protocol environments over a
single circuit. Above all, it provides bandwidth on demand at speeds over
ten times faster than X25 packet switching.
Steve Priestley, UK sales manager at Dynatech Communications, says: 'We
firmly believe that frame relay will become the network of the future
because it has so many obvious advantages. It enables different applications
and protocols to be transported transparently across the network. Coupled
with this, it reduces bandwidth costs and can offer substantial savings to
heavy networks users.'
Private network managers have been among the first to consolidate traffic
over existing lines with frame relay, according to Robert McGuire, technical
director at Ascom Timeplex.
This, he says, is 'because the capital investment pays off quickly and the
additional cost of adding more facilities that need more bandwidth is
delayed. If connecting remote locations to the backbone involves fairly high
leased line charges then public frame relay becomes an attractive
alternative.'
But as promising as frame relay is, says McGuire, it is no panacea - 'like
all technologies, it provides dramatic benefits where it is deployed in the
correct setting to achieve realistic goals.
'Frame relay is ideal for WAN traffic originating from LANs, but it is not
deemed appropriate, for example, for time-critical transfer of financial
information, where point-to-point leased lines would be a better, more
secure option.'
Similarly, 'X25 packet switching would provide ample throughput rates where
the network consists primarily of cluster controllers for host terminal or
other low-speed transmissions.'
ATM makes the ultimate goal of seamless enterprise wide networks a reality,
say its proponents, because it means there is no longer any need to run two
separate and non-interlinked networks.
The only problem with ATM is that the CCITT standards have not been yet
finalised. Nevertheless, the 150 members of the ATM Forum are pressing ahead
with systems developments that can be upgraded in the field via software.
The first implementations will be on private networks. It will then take 18
months before ATM is generally available. Only then, it is said, will the
bandwagon effect take over.
By launching a very low-cost ATM LAN solution, SynOptics aims to be at the
forefront of that. Product line manager, Robert Newman, cites the benefits
of ATM when it becomes available at WAN level:
Massive performance increases, with high-speed dedicated connections and
high aggregate network bandwidth.
Flexible breakthroughs, with scalable end-node connection speed, scaleable
aggregate network bandwidth; and global workgroups through WANS.
Data and real-time multi-media support.
Standards shared by local and public network vendors.
Enhanced management and control.
Newman adds: 'The initial drive for ATM is coming from graphics-intensive
users on LANs who, individually, may only need file transfer at 10Mbps but,
collectively, need 100Mbps or more if bottlenecks are not to bring projects
to a grinding halt.
'With an X25 WAN you drop down to 56Kbps and that does not make sense.
ATM provides 155Mbits per second.'
There are a number of initiatives underway. For example, GPT, Siemens and BT
are set to deploy Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), heralded as the first
evolutionary step towards ATM broadband networks of tomorrow. AT&amp;T, Cisco
and Stratacom have just announced that they will be working together to
launch products for the first public full ATM service in the UK.
Northern Telecom believes that the ability to support both narrowband and
wideband applications within a consolidated network of the future is
crucial, hence the development of Magellan Passport. Its frame-switching
capabilities within an open architecture deliver cost-effective bandwidth
utilisation for data communications, while its cell capabilities allow
consolidation of bursty, high-speed data with delay-sensitive voice and
video.

Fraud may cost Dollars 4bn a year - Computer security: new moves are under
way to beat the 'hackers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is impossible to fully estimate how much computer-based fraud costs
businesses every year, partly because not all frauds are discovered
immediately, and partly because many companies fear the loss of credibility
from publicly revealing that they have been a target. Some guesses, however,
put it as high a Dollars 4bn a year.
Fraud, particularly as data communication traffic increases, is just one
reason why companies and institutions need to pay keen attention to the
security of their computer systems. The other important reason is the
proliferation of the computer virus.
The research company, Input, has estimated that the revenues of electronic
data interchange (EDI) service companies, in Europe alone, will jump from
Dollars 134m last year, to Dollars 660m by 1997. This is just the cost for
carrying EDI traffic - such as purchase orders, invoices and, perhaps most
important of all, payment transfers. The value of these will probably total
the majority of business transacted between EC-member countries. This
represents a significant target for anyone with the skills to gain access to
the systems, and many so-called 'hackers' have both the skills and resources
to carry out the work, sometimes with surprising ease.
One class of system that has shown vulnerability over recent times is the
local area network (LAN), the now widely used method for linking desktop
personal computers to one or more central file servers where corporate data
is stored.
Novell, whose NetWare system is used by about 70 per cent of the PC LAN
market, has been an obvious target for hackers. Dutch academics at Leiden
University discovered what has been quaintly called the 'mechanism for
intrusion,' a program which would keep throwing packets of access code at
the system till the right code was found. This could be used either locally,
on one of the PCs connected to the system, or remotely via a phone and
modem.
A hacker could then access all the files on the system without the need for
password protection, meaning that valuable corporate data was at risk of
theft or modification. Once the mechanism was discovered, Novell set to work
to develop a solution. Its first step was to develop a 'check stop' utility,
which checks to see if wrong code packets are being tried and then stops all
access from that PC or remote access gateway.
It has subsequently developed more complex fixes which utilise more rigorous
authentication checks and encryption of the access protocol data.
A second phase in the development will also encrypt data as it moves around
the network. The biggest problem here is that increasing the levels of
security available also tends to slow systems down. Some estimates suggest
NetWare can be up to 40 per cent slower using the encryption techniques.
One obvious step that can be taken to control intra-company hackers is to
increase the level and complexity of network monitoring. This is a
capability offered by systems such as the Computer Misuse Detection System
from SIAC (UK). Developed for Unix systems, this sets out to monitor the
activity on a corporate network, checking both for deviations from the
expected activity, and activity that steps outside the set of 'rules'
defined by the company for network traffic.
In this way, the systems administrators can be warned of improper network
activity, and in particular attempts at access to data by users with the
wrong security level, as they are attempting it. It then becomes possible to
monitor what they are doing and stop them if necessary.
Solutions such as these point to the best ways of protecting against the
hacker. Live monitoring of a network makes it possible to spot irregular and
possibly illegal activity as it is happening, while encrypting the data on
the network makes it more difficult for the hacker to generate any value for
the information accessed, if they manage to break through.
The penalty from a company's point of view, is an inevitable reduction in
overall system performance. This may not be overly significant, but should
be taken into consideration when specifying the system in the first place.
Operations can also be slowed by staff adhering fully to all system
management procedures but this can be important, particularly when it comes
to the other prime security problem, attacks by viruses.
THE fundamental principle here is that the vast majority of viruses can be
trapped and removed from a system when detected. Regular scanning of the
entire system is, therefore, an essential pre-requisite of maintaining the
integrity of a company's valuable applications and data. Virus scanners such
as those from S&amp;S International in the UK and McAfee in the US are regularly
updated with the tools necessary to spot and remove the latest viruses, with
many of their clients sending them the latest discoveries.
It is a big business for them. McAfee recently went public on the US stock
market and, despite being a company of only 30 employees, raised over
Dollars 48m.
Many viruses cause no real problems to system users bar annoyance. Others,
such as the famous Michelangelo virus of last year, carry a 'payload' that
can be extremely destructive - and users run the risk of losing all their
business data, or at least the data created since the last system back-up
was carried out.
With the increasing use of communications such as electronic mail and EDI
systems, the number of ways in which a virus can infect a company's system
has risen dramatically. If an infected file is sent to another system, it
carries the virus within it. Once in a new system, it is free to spread and
infect other files. This is why regular scanning is important.
Many viruses need an action to trigger them, often the process of loading
the infected file. Others - and so far these have normally been the more
destructive ones - are triggered by an external event such as a date change.
As with the Michelangelo virus, regular scanning can catch the virus and
eradicate it before it has been triggered.

Benefits go beyond cost-savings - Facilities Management: contracting-out the
running of a company's computing and data communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING on computing and communications facilities management will overtake
sales of mainframe computers in the UK within five years.
That forecast by market research firm Dataquest reflects the buoyancy of a
business which was growing by almost 50 per cent a year in the UK by the end
of the 1980s and is still enjoying annual growth of around 25 per cent.
But such success is attracting many new services companies - and the
increasing competition is forcing suppliers to do deals which threaten the
reputation and future of the whole business, according to some suppliers and
market researchers.
Moving to facilities management typically means contracting out the running
of a company's computing and data communications.
In the classic arrangement, a service supplier takes over a company's
central computer and most or all of the computing staff. The equipment and
staff might stay at the customer's premises and be managed there by the new
owner and employer, or they might move to the service company's premises.
Alternatively, the systems can be transferred to a computer already run by
the ser vice supplier, leaving the customer the possibility of selling its
equipment. In most cases the service will eventually be based away from the
customer's premises.
A variation on this theme is when the customer is switching to different
equipment and systems, for example in move to so-called downsizing:
typically the replacement of a central mainframe with a network of smaller
computers.
Here, the service supplier might take on the old systems and keep them
running, perhaps with some of the customer's staff, while the customer's
computing department stays largely intact and works on the new systems.
Telecommunications is a key part of most services. Some companies contract
out the building and management of their networks.
In computing facilities management, telecoms is vital if the customer is to
have the same level of access to the now-remote central computing service as
it had when it ran the service itself.
Service suppliers have long agreed on the claimed benefits. Recent surveys
show that users broadly find the claims are justified.
Separate studies by service supplier CMG and research firm Romtec show that
users see facilities management offering fixed costs, known well in advance,
for a guaranteed level of service. This is the biggest perceived benefit in
both surveys: in the CMG study over 60 per cent of users mentioned it.
Almost 60 per cent of customers also see a move to facilities management
freeing them to concentrate on their core business: they no longer have to
concern themselves with running a support activity which is in effect a
totally different business in its own right.
The suppliers' argument here is that companies contract out catering and
vehicle fleet management and even key activities such as research and
development, manufacturing and distribution - so why not computing and
networks?
The other main benefit seen by users is that facilities management overcomes
the shortage of internal skills and resources: the service suppliers are
centres of concentrated expertise and have to keep their skills up to date
in a competitive market. This benefit gets a 50 per cent vote in CMG's
survey and a 40 per cent mention in Romtec's.
An extra point raised here by the CMG study is that contracting out reduces
staff numbers and therefore staff costs.
Users largely agree on the disadvantages, too. However, in both the Romtec
and the CMG surveys, the existing users give much higher scores to the
benefits than to the disadvantages. In addition, non-users give higher
ratings to the disadvantages than users do, suggesting that the anxieties
decline or prove groundless once a service goes live.
Issues mentioned by around a third of users are loss of control of
day-to-day service and of strategy, loss of internal skills, the supplier's
lack of understanding of the customer's business and the possibility of a
future price rise.
Costs and cost-savings are more contentious issues. Facilities management
contracts involve big money: almost half the contracts run to more than
Pounds 500,000 a year and 16 per cent cost over Pounds 2m, according to the
CMG study.
Last month, Woolworths signed a Pounds 10m three-year contract with Hoskyns
involving the transfer of all 51 computing staff and an IBM mainframe
running all Woolworths' financial, distribution and sales analysis systems.
Woolworths expects to save 20 per cent of its computing costs.
Service suppliers put cost savings at between 10 and 25 per cent. However,
43 per cent of users questioned in the CMG survey said there had been no
savings.
In addition, over half the non-users in the Romtec survey said they rejected
facilities management because the costs were too high: this was the biggest
reason for rejection among all those questioned. But some suppliers and
observers say users need to look beyond the costs issue, which threatens the
future of stable facilities management services.
THE big growth of the market has recently attracted many suppliers. A
business dominated in the 1970s and 1980s by a handful of established
services now has an estimated 150 companies seeking a share. But running a
successful business depends on having the right number of customers to fill
a computer with work and keep a software team fully occupied.
'The potential for significant economies of scale is declining and the
opportunity to achieve healthy profit margins is diminishing,' says Mr
Graham Brown, a consultant at research company, IDC. 'This squeeze on
margins is exacerbated by a significant increase in competition.'
He adds: 'The combination of margin pressure and the fight for market share
will have a significant impact on the market and may result in a reduction
of service levels and unsatisfactory relationships between suppliers and
clients.'
CMG managing director Mr John Rioch puts this more bluntly: 'Suppliers are
buying market share through deals which are marginal or even below margin,
to get and keep their volumes up.'
Others concede this point - but put a different interpretation on it - 'some
suppliers are taking the long view, looking for profit in the third or
fourth year as they win extra business such as system development from their
client,' says Mr Jon Whiteley of Romtec.
Mr Gary Shepherd of service supplier AT&amp;T-Istel agrees. He is also chairman
of the Computing Services Association's special interest group on facilities
management.
'Companies are buying business to get economies of scale - but this is not
necessarily to the detriment of the client,' he says. 'Increasingly, the
initial contract is becoming just the start of a long relationship.
Contracts used to be around three years; now we're signing contracts of five
years and soon it will be 10 years.'
Even so, he believes there will be a considerable shake-out in the next five
or 10 years, with the market centring on 15 to 20 companies.
John Rioch at CMG says future success will depend on suppliers and customers
realising together that facilities management is more than just about
cost-savings.
'Companies see information technology as a problem, whether it's one of
costs or delivering systems on time,' he says. 'So they look at facilities
management and they're inundated with options.
'But they need to start by looking at their own internal organisation and
what they are trying to achieve as a business. It's not just a case of
unloading the computer department. Facilities management should be
considered against the whole background of factors such as business
re-engineering.'
Mr Rioch also believes that companies which rush into facilities management,
seeing it mainly as a costs issue, end up with contracts with too many grey
areas. He points to CMG's survey, which shows that the biggest concern for
users is defining the boundaries of responsibilities: it was mentioned by
half the user respondents.

More hope for a troubled marriage - ISDN Services: a chance to exploit the
combination of voice and data communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARRIAGE of computers and telecommunications has long been a troubled
one. The respective cultures - the fast-moving, short-termism of the
computing industry and the lumbering, long-termism of telecommunications -
have found it hard to meet on common ground.
Furthermore, the couple are fundamentally incompatible; telecoms talk
'analog' and computers talk 'digital.' The couple can only communicate
through a cumbersome translation device called a modulator/de-modulator or
modem. Not only does this reduce the speed and richness of the dialogue, it
also costs more and is unreliable.
As computers cannot possibly talk anything else, the answer was for telecom
networks to learn how to talk 'digital.' For the last quarter of a century,
telecommunications suppliers have worked towards this goal and built digital
networks alongside the old analog voice networks.
While these have served the needs of large international companies and
institutions who could afford to lease digital lines from the telecom
suppliers, they have not advanced the cause of universal digital telecoms.
Furthermore, it makes no sense at all to have two independent networks
operating side-by-side, with double the installation cost and twice as much
maintenance. The answer is to combine them in a single piece of wire or
optical fibre and carry voice and data down the same digital 'pipe.'
This is a crude definition of the answer that the computer and
telecommunications industries have come up with: integrated services digital
networking (ISDN).
Although ISDN has been around for some years now, it is only recently that
it has attracted the attention of users.
There are two main reasons. Firstly, ISDN services are now available to a
greater number of potential users. In the UK, British Telecom is expanding
the ISDN service quickly with a total of 9,000 subscriber lines for the
two-channel basic ISDN service now installed.
Secondly, the increased demand for networking of all kinds has meant that
ISDN has found a place alongside existing leased digital lines both as a
back-up service and to enable new applications.
Furthermore, standardisation across Europe means that ISDN can be used for
international telecoms. In the past, the lack of a standard method for
sending ISDN signals has slowed progress. But Germany, France and the UK
have now adopted the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
300/075 Eurofile transfer standard for ISDN, which makes it possible to use
the service for transnational digital communications. It is expected that
all European countries will have this standard in place by 1995.
'ISDN is the only internationally-available digital voice/data network. It
enables international data exchange and can cut costs dramatically,' says Mr
Peter Slade, sales director with the networking specialist, Maxim Networks.
'ISDN goes across all markets, too; we have identified 34 potential vertical
markets for ISDN-based applications in Europe,' he goes on.
The spread of the ETSI standard is likely to be accompanied by a significant
rise in the use of ISDN. Market researcher Dataquest puts the value of the
European market for ISDN terminal equipment at about Dollars 79m in 1991 and
expects this to rise to Dollars 270m by 1996 - growth rate of 20 per cent a
year.
This will be accompanied by a proliferation of ISDN 'lines' - growing from a
80,000 primary rate lines at the end of 1991 to a million by 1995. Germany
and France are leading the way, with the UK expected to grow fast.
The growth in the use of ISDN is unlikely to have a great impact on the
existing market for leased lines. Large users will continue to use leased
lines for the foreseeable future, unless telecom suppliers change their
tariffs. Many large users do, however, use ISDN as their back-up network to
save them the cost of two leased lines - one of which would be redundant
most of the time.
Where ISDN really comes into its own is in the area of 'casual' use - that
is, where connections are only required for a few minutes at a time or for
up to three or four hours a day. Such applications do not warrant the cost
of a leased line but need the speed and performance advantages of digital
communications. Dial-up ISDN can achieve this.
'In addition to cutting costs, ISDN provides access, availability and the
extra bandwidth for applications. It provides more efficiency on the back of
existing applications,' explains Mr Paul Sirikal, marketing manager with the
networking company Ascom Timeplex.
But ISDN is more than only a better way to handle existing communications.
It also offers the opportunity to build new applications which exploit the
combination of voice and data communications.
'Customers have an increased requirement for access to on-line data - as
well as back-up and overflow capacity. ISDN can meet these needs and meet
the demand for 'casual' connection. The advantage of ISDN is that you can
adjust the size of the 'pipe' to suit the application,' says Mr Sirikal.
The trend toward automation of 'remote' working - where staff are away from
their offices - is key.
'We see the remote office as one of the main applications of ISDN,' says
Nigel Oakley, UK product marketing manager for networking company, 3Com.
The electronic office is expected to be one of the leading applications of
ISDN. Employees on the move with laptop computers can plug into the ISDN
network and communicate with their central office far more efficiently than
with existing modem-based communications. They can also send and receive
'voicemail' messages and process types of data (large database files, video,
high-resolution graphics) which would have been impossible with the older
technology.
Office systems will not be the only beneficiary of improved digital
communications. BT and IBM, for example, are set to launch a personal
computer-based videophone system in the UK later this year. This uses ISDN
to carry digitised video from one PC to another and has strong potential in
a variety of applications.
ISDN is an important part of a fundamental change in the infrastructure of
global telecommunications.
In the long-term, we will see most network traffic being transmitted
digitally with all of the advantages this brings. We may also see a
successful consummation of the marriage of computers and telecommunications.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (12): US
businesses are leading the way - Virtual Private Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN in the age of the global corporation, human behaviour is slow to
change: many people have a mental block about phoning their colleagues, just
because they have to use an international dialling code.
According to Robert Taylor, consulting manager in international
communications at pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham, such reluctance
to make international calls creates a geographic barrier. This can limit the
progress of a company - 'if a company manufactures a product in one part of
the world, and someone in another part of the world wants to use the same
techniques, why not share that knowledge?' he says.
Mr Taylor believes that a new-style phone service, known as a virtual
private network or VPN, could go a long way to solving the problem. A
virtual private network offers businesses a way to link the switchboards on
different office sites, without having the expense of installing and running
their own private network.
In its most basic form, a VPN means that staff can use short code internal
phone numbers to any of the sites which are connected. Those sites could
even be in a different country. More sophisticated VPNs also permit the
system to call back when an engaged number becomes free, or to display the
number of the person calling.
Such facilities won't be new to British or US companies which have had
private telephone networks for several years. But in countries such as
France and Germany, VPNs will be the first opportunity for many companies to
obtain an advanced telephone capability.
Barclays Bank was the first organisation to sign up for British Telecom's
VPN service. John Grimmett, chief executive of Barclays Network Services,
wants to use the VPN to expand the private network facilities to many of the
bank's smaller branches where a private line is not viable.
Mr Grimmett was also attracted by the flexibility of the VPN, which be
dynamically re-configured to handle business changes within the bank.
For example, the bank might operate a payment service out of six branches in
the London area, but wants to concentrate the processing in just one of
them. Customers, on the other hand, should not have to be told to re-dial if
they call their branch with query.
Using the VPN, calls can be transferred internally, and it appears to the
customers that everything takes place in their branch.
Another VPN convert is French chemical company, Rhone Poulenc. It took the
decision on the basis of cost: for competitive reasons, most telephone
companies are pricing their VPN services at a discount to both private and
public network facilities.
'In France, the company did a full-cost analysis, looking at private
networks compared with VPN, and was initially surprised at the savings,'
said Peter Hewitt, telecom manager for the company's UK operations.
The Rhone Poulenc vpn stretches across four countries and is one of the
first to set up international links. It currently comprises BT's Featurenet
in the UK, France Telecom's Colissee service, MCI's V-Net in the US, and
KDD's Virnet in Japan. So far, 26 sites in France, 80 in the US, three in
the UK, and four in Japan have been hooked up.
Links between the VPNs in each country have been set up by the phone
companies. This means that Rhone Poulenc obtains the same facilities on
international calls as on national calls. Thus, French employees only have
to dial a seven-digit number to reach colleagues in the UK. And if they fly
to the US office, and want to call the same people, they dial the same seven
digits.
It's too early, however, to say how popular the facility will be: the UK
sites have only been connected since December last year. However, monitoring
of calling patterns in France has shown that employees are gradually getting
into the habit of calling via the VPN, although the total number of calls
has not increased.
Mr Hewitt also believes that he will make significant savings on the annual
telephone bill in the UK. He said that BT's VPN tariffs offer a 25 per
discount on international calls, and almost half of the company's UK phone
calls are to its own locations abroad.
Although some phone companies do publish VPN tariffs, most international VPN
contracts are individually negotiated. Susan Ablett, an analyst with
specialist research company Analysys of Cambridge, believes that corporate
customers are now in a position where they can use their financial muscle to
obtain good deals on VPNs - 'we say to them to use their negotiating power.
They are in a powerful position now to bring down prices, which they weren't
two years' ago,' she says.
However, Mr Taylor believes that the European phone companies could do more
to make their VPN services attractive. SmithKline Beecham is an active user
of VPN services in the US, and he is looking at possibilities for the Cable
and Wireless-Sprint joint venture known as global virtual private network
(GVPN).
In his view, the US phone companies provide better support for customers.
For example, their staff work full-time on the customer's premises. They
also provide bigger discounts for high-volume corporate customers. He would
like to see similar customer support and incentives offered on this side of
the Atlantic.
But the US market for VPNs is much more mature than in Europe, and was worth
an estimated Dollars 2.5bn in 1992. It grew up rapidly in the late 1980s,
when the three phone companies, MCI, Sprint and AT&amp;T waged a price-cutting
war.
Today, the market research company Yankee Group estimates that US customers
can get discounts of up to 38 per cent can be obtained on five-year
contracts.
Further deals are offered to customers interested in calling card or free
phone facilities - for example, sales reps are given a calling card and PIN
number, so that they can call the office from anywhere, and the call travels
via the VPN.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (9): 'No
LAN is an island' - Enlarged Local Area Networks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a time when IBM and other leaders of the information technology industry
are in trouble, one sector is growing by leaps and bounds. Internetworking -
the linking together of small personal computer networks to create one giant
computer - is flourishing as businesses everywhere seek to make the most of
existing information technology investments.
Internetworking has sprung out of the local area network (LAN) industry.
LANs were originally only intended to link small groups of personal
computers. But they have proliferated in many organisations, and their cost
has come down so low that they have become a commodity item.
Now, many companies are realising that these isolated LANs could bring more
benefit if they were tied together. The enlarged LAN should improve the
dissemination of corporate information and increase staff productivity:
where data was previously requested by telephone delivered by courier, it
can instead be retrieved electronically.
For example, staff at Strathclyde Regional Council are soon going to be able
to tap into data on debtors and creditors from any of the council's 120
office sites. The system will also provide up to date information on other
activities such as social work.
'I have a saying here that 'no LAN is an island.' While they might start as
a standalone LAN, we find they rapidly grow and need to share information,
says Mr Lindsay Barr, distributed systems services manager at Strathclyde.
Internetworking has gained further momentum from the trend towards
'downsizing' - replacing large, expensive mainframes, with smaller personal
and mid-range computers. As a result, leading vendors are growing at rates
of 40 per cent or more per year.
Synoptics, a leading vendor of internetwork hub products grew 57 per cent in
1992 over 1991, reporting revenues of Dollars 388m, over Dollars 248m the
previous year. Its smaller rival, Chipcom, grew its 1992 sales by 82 per
cent, up to Dollars 87m from Dollars 47m in 1991.
Wellfleet, number two to Cisco for the supply of routers - products which
transmit traffic between LANS - almost doubled its revenues for the six
months to December 31 last year. It reported Dollars 72m, up from Dollars
34m the previous year. However, customers are becoming concerned that the
vendors are riding high on their growth figures and failing to address a
number of key problems.
Internetworking is not a simple process. John Wise, who heads up the lobby
group known as European Network Users' Forum, says that network managers
commonly run into difficulty when they try to interwork different types of
networks. But the vendors are not being helpful in finding a solution.
For example, joining a Novell Netware network with a Microsoft LAN Manager
network will result in many of the functions of both networks being lost. In
such a case, someone in one office wanting to access a database held
elsewhere, may find they can't do so - 'if your LAN strategies have evolved
independently - and this tends to be the case historically - then you have
disparate collection of LANs which you then have to interwork. You have to
find a way of doing this. I think it's a problem,' says Mr Wise.
There are further difficulties when it comes to managing the network. This
entails checking how much data is stored on file servers, and how much
traffic is travelling along the lines. This information is important for
planning the system capacity, so that users always have access to what they
need.
Jim McMahon, an independent networking consultant, says that the problem
occurs because most network operating systems, such as Netware and LAN
Manager, remain proprietary.
'There seems to be an ambiguous approach to being open, because the vendors
don't want to lose their competitiveness. The support for interworking of
multi-vendor LANs is not as good as if you've got all of one environment or
the other,' he says.
Novell claims to address this issue, at least partially, in its latest
version of Netware, version 4, released earlier this month. It says the new
software offers better interworking with networks running the Unix operating
system. But Mr McMahon, who is having to find a solution to this issue for a
pan-European LAN-based network, remains sceptical - 'wait and see,' he says.
Novell also says it does supply products to interwork Netware with other
networks, but has not been very good at telling its customers of their
existence.
Another issue that concerns users is the implementation of new technologies.
Chief among these is known by the ungainly title of asynchronous transfer
mode or ATM. This will eventually provide super-fast data transmission at
speeds of up to 2.4 gigabits per second.
Such high speeds should make it easier for companies to transmit large data
files, such as video and image. A problem today is that LANs become
overloaded and crash if too many people try to access the system at once;
video or image transmission on a large scale is difficult. It is envisaged
that ATM could provide the backbone network, carrying the bulk of the
traffic.
ATM was originally conceived by the telecom industry for wide area
transmission, but has been hi-jacked by local area network vendors.
Unlike telecom suppliers, they exist in a ferociously competitive market.
They have therefore pressed ahead much faster with product development.
Products are scheduled to appear this year. Cisco, Synoptics, and UK vendor
Fibrenet all say they will have an initial product by the autumn of this
year. And Wellfleet, Network Equipment Technologies and another UK company
Netcomm, could be ready sooner.
But as the vendors rush to lay out their ATM stalls, customers want to know
how they will migrate from today's products to ATM. Mr Laki Marangos,
communications manager at merchant bank Morgan Grenfell says he wants to see
stepping stones to new technologies, so that he can meet new business
requirements for networking facilities with an incremental cost.
Mr Marangos would not want to buy an entire new network, in order to get ATM
capability - 'if you buy products today, they must fit in with your existing
and future requirements,' he says.
Many are also unsure of the true benefits of ATM. Mr Barr says he will be
looking at ATM, but it's too early to say what use it might be. And he adds:
'Every technology is of interest, but being at the leading edge is
expensive, in terms of resources as well as finance.'

Prizes to the value of Pounds 20,000 - Competition: Business Software
Challenge '90s
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S young software writers have the chance to win prizes to the value
of Pounds 20,000, plus a range of hardware and software, in this year's
'Business Software Challenge '90s,' the results of which will be covered
later this year in the FT's quarterly review of business software, Software
at Work.
The competition is sponsored and funded by software vendor, Computer
Associates, which founded it two years ago as a way of encouraging students
to write applications to solve real business problems. Also giving their
support are the British Computer Society, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the
Institute of Management.
The competition is aimed at students in higher education, working
individually or in teams, and recent graduates. They are invited to submit
current work which solves a specific, defined, business problem. There is no
definition of what applications are appropriate, but judges look for robust,
working solutions and a clear explanation of the business benefits.
The software should run on a commonly available computer, and integrate with
other relevant software where applicable. Entrants must be able to
demonstrate how their design addresses a particular problem.
Entries close on August 27.
Previous winners
Winners in previous years have been responsible for a number of highly
promising products, and some have gone on to full-time careers in software
design. The 1992 winner was a system by Stephen Marshall at the University
of Sheffield which helped medical staff make accurate diagnoses of patients
suffering heart attacks.
Prize-winners in the past have received help in taking their products to the
appropriate marketplace. Computer Associates retains no rights of any sort,
however, over the software submitted.

The million machine link-up - Internet Boom: the world's largest-ever
collection of computer networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JUDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE worldwide telephone network has been described as the biggest machine
ever built, and has certainly brought about some of the biggest changes in
human existence this century. It now has a rapidly growing rival: the
worldwide Internet.
The Internet is not a single network; it is the biggest collection of
computer networks ever linked together. It connects around a million
machines and new subscribers are joining at a rate of 100,000 per month  - a
growth of ten per cent each month.
Like the phone network, Internet gives global connectivity: access to any
other machine connected to the system. This gives the equivalent of a
facsimile connection direct to any other user. But computers in contact can
offer further services, from electronic mail onwards.
Despite this, few people have heard of the Internet, and business users are
only just beginning to exploit it as a resource.
The first commercial services in the UK began in 1992, and have grown
rapidly. Pipex, run by Unipalm of Cambridge, with a service that costs from
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 10,000 per year, is taking Pounds 100,000 each month
in subscription fees and has 78 subscribers.
Each Pipex subscriber gets a connection to their office and can link their
whole internal network to the worldwide Internet. One of Internet's great
advantages over other services such as X25 is the fact that Internet
protocols are the same as those used on many local area networks.
So far, Pipex subscribers include such companies as Barclays Bank, Eagle
Star, Guardian Royal Exchange, Powergen, the British Library, and City firms
such as Trygg-Hansa. Many people in these companies use Internet without
realising it.
On a smaller scale, Demon Internet Services offers a simpler connection for
home users and smaller businesses, at a cost of Pounds 10 a month. The
service started as a sideline in June 1992, when software house Demon
Systems decided to spread the cost of its own Internet connection.
'We planned to get 200 to 400 people,' says Grahame Davis of Demon Internet
Services. 'We've now got 750 people, and that is rising at about 100 per
month.'
If this continues the service will have to be turned into a fully-fledged
line of business, or sold off.
Other ways into the Internet include gateways available from several
bulletin boards such as Compulink Information Exchange (CIX) and mail
services such as Compuserve. Most of these will forward electronic mail, but
some give access to other Internet services.
Internet has been hidden from view because it was developed for academic
traffic and first boomed in linking research workers. It is also based on de
facto standard protocols which are out of favour in official circles.
The Internet began with the US Department of Defense's ARPAnet, which began
with four machines in 1969. During the 1970s, ARPAnet was linked with other
networks and developed its own standard protocols, called TCP/IP. Other
protocols including the OSI standards were used on the nets, but only
experimentally.
More and more networks joined the Internet during the 1980s.
Europe was slowest to adopt the service, possibly due to official pressure
to adopt services which use the rival OSI protocols. Strangely, the Internet
was developed with US public money, despite the fact that North America also
has an OSI policy. Much of the funding came indirectly, through researchers'
salaries. In 1992, control of the Internet and its protocols passed from a
self-appointed committee to a new body called the Internet Society, in a bid
to make the Internet more acceptable in official circles.
The Society also plans to raise development funds for the Internet.
In the meantime, the growth of the Internet may bring its own problems. As
its exponential growth continues, it will have to create new 'addresses' -
the electronic 'telephone numbers' assigned to each system on the network.
With telephone numbers, this is done by adding extra digits, as in London's
recent change from 01 to 071/081, and the extra 1 soon to appear in all UK
phone numbers. On a network, the solution is similar.
However, there are technical and political dimensions to the situation. The
Internet protocols are old, and a change of addressing would be a good time
to introduce new versions of them.
This has sparked an argument over which protocols to use, and how to
structure addresses.
The Internet Society is taking the matter seriously, but some Internet
promoters believe it has been blown out of proportion.
'The issue has become an opportunity for some unscrupulous people to sow
doubt about the Internet,' says Mr Dawe. 'The Internet is adapting to the
continued tidal wave of users. The problem has been well forecast and there
will be minimal disruption caused.'
OSI protocols have been suggested, notably by Richard des Jardins, a
lecturer and consultant based in Washington DC, and one of the original
architects of OSI. He believes that governments and the phone companies will
create a parallel OSI-based Internet: 'Why let a second Internet get
started, even if the TCP/IP Internet is dominant? The only interests that
would be served would be the hardliners on both sides and the vendors who
make money on unnecessary duality.'
If the Internet adopted the OSI protocols alongside its own, it would be a
basis for an 'international dial-tone,' claims Dr DesJardins. 'The
alternative is the internet equivalent of one half of the world using one
electrical power standard, and the other half using a different and
incompatible standard, and trying to plug into each other.'
The Internet community do not see it that way: they object that the
protocols are too 'heavyweight.' They are not being run over users' internal
networks, so the solution would destroy the homogeneity currently available.
And, says Peter Dawe of Unipalm, the system is too complex: 'OSI also allows
too many addresses - enough to address every single particle in the
universe, individually.'
In the short-term, the Internet has come up with a system to redistribute
the existing addresses and get more use from them. In the next two years,
the Internet Society will choose a new protocol (OSI or not), which will run
alongside the existing Internet - 'the two networks will run concurrently
and transparently,' says Mr Dawe. 'Over time, systems will phase over to the
new one.'
Whatever the solution to the technical issues, the Internet seems set to
keep growing. It is a demonstration of what can be achieved with a simple
practical approach to networking, and an example of how to use government
money in a well-controlled project.
'The Internet is going ballistic,' says Dan Lynch, president of Interop,
which organises events for the Internet community.
'It cannot survive technically much longer without some strong central
(worldwide) operational collective that sorts out routing and directory
service issues. I have hoped that the 'phone companies' of the world would
figure out how great an opportunity they have to provide these services but,
thus far, they have squandered their lead. But someone will get it together.
There are just too many trillions of marks to be made.'

Plenty of surprises ahead - Personal Computers: PC power increases as prices
plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR the past few years the personal computer market has been in turmoil.
Plunging prices, relatively flat sales outside Europe, and wafer-thin
margins have taken their toll and left many heavyweight market leaders -
including IBM - floundering.
Over the past decade, the personal computer has revolutionised corporate
data processing and thrown up a new set of challenges and opportunities for
suppliers and their increasingly sophisticated customers.
PCs now dominate the computer industry, accounting for 44.5 per cent of
revenues last year, according to Dataquest, the US-based IT consultancy.
This was nearly as much as mainframes (21.6 per cent) and minis (23.4 per
cent) combined. Workstations (8.7 per cent) and supercomputers (1.8 per
cent) made up the rest.
'Direct' mail-order sales have helped nimble lower-cost clone-makers - such
as Dell - to challenge, and in some cases overtake, their more lethargic
rivals. Direct sales accounted for 37 per cent of the UK market last year,
according to figures from Romtec, the UK-based market research organisation.
Other new distribution channels include the PC 'superstore,' which, like
direct selling, have been imported to Europe from the US.
The wide availability of low-cost high-quality PC components, mostly from
Far Eastern suppliers, has turned much of the hardware market into a
commodity business and removed most barriers to entry for the clone-makers.
Customer-loyalty is low and, for many, the only distinguishing factors
between suppliers are price and service.
Meanwhile, the pace of technological change is still accelerating,
shortening product cycles and propelling new concepts like desktop
video-conferencing, multimedia, and the integration of voice, data and video
to the fore.
In the office, workstations for computer-aided design and manufacturing
(CAD/CAM) and desktop PCs, many of then linked by local area networks
(LANs), have brought real computing power to the desktop and provided a huge
market for operating system and business software companies.
On the factory floor, personal computers now control automated production
and manufacturing systems while outside the office, notebook computers have
delivered fully functional computing power 'on the move.' About one-in-five
of all PC sales today are portables, and the proportion is increasing.
Consultants Frost Sullivan estimate total shipments of portable computers in
the US last year at 2.3m units, 2.14 of which were notebook machines.
The notebook computer has been made possible by greater silicon integration
and the overall trend towards miniaturisation which have allowed designers
to pack more and more computing power into lighter packages.
At the same time, low-power chips, standard processors, improved battery and
screen technology, and new lightweight components like PCMIA-card drives
have enabled manufacturers to deliver most if not all the functionality of
desktop systems in much smaller boxes.
Taken to the extreme this has resulted in a crop of even smaller machines
called hand-held computers and palm-tops. Some, equipped with mobile radio
communications, are already being used to collect data outside the office
and transmit it back to headquarters - exemplifying the increasing
integration of telecommunications and computing. Meanwhile, new pen-based
and voice-activated computers provide the prospect easier to use machines
while IBM, Apple Computer and others are talking about personal digital
assistants (PDAs) which will integrate voice and data communications and
processing power in a machine small enough to fit in a coat pocket.
Apple's Newton, which is due to be launched later this year, will be a
pocket-sized machine combining computing power and the ability to accept pen
input, with many of the facilities of an electronic organiser. Separately,
EO, a Californian company, is working with AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
giant, and Japan's Matsushita to develop a personal communicator combining
the features of a cellular telephone and a hand-held computer.
Today, however, the PC industry's leaders are not so much the PC
manufacturers themselves, but companies such as Intel, the US semiconductor
manufacturer which makes the microprocessors used by the majority of PCs;
Microsoft, the software group which sells, MS/DOS, the most popular
operating system, the Windows 'environment' and a wide range of business and
other software packages; and Novell, which markets the most popular
networking software.
Software is increasingly important in setting hardware parameters from
desktops to notebooks. According to Romtec sales of Windows-based
application software topped DOS-based software for the first time in the UK
in November last year.
Since Windows applications generally require large amounts of memory and
storage, and benefit from fast processors, larger screens and add-ons like
dedicated graphics accelerators the specifications of the entry level
desktop machine have been pushed up.
This process of upward power migration has been cultivated by Intel which,
as part of its marketing strategy, has developed a range of upgradable
'clock-doubled' processors built around its 80486 microprocessor - soon to
be displaced by the its new high-end 'Pentium' processor. However, Intel no
longer has the PC processor market all to itself. New chips from its rivals,
AMD and Cyrix, have added to the recent proliferation of processor types.
In terms of hardware boxes, IBM is still the world leader in PC sales, with
revenues from its PC business of between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 10bn a year
and a worldwide market share of about 12.4 per cent followed by Apple (11.9
per cent), Compaq (6.6 per cent), NEC (5.1 per cent) and Dell (3.5 per
cent), according to Dataquest figures. The European leader is Olivetti of
Italy, while NEC continues to dominate the Japanese market thanks to its
proprietary design.
PC manufacturers across the world have, however, had to come to grips with
some new economic realities. In particular corporate customers are no longer
scaling up their IT expenditure each year. Dataquest, the US-based
consultancy, estimates that total investment in computer systems actually
fell by about Dollars 2.5bn to just under Dollars 104.5bn last year. The
decline mainly reflects the recession, the continuing decline in the cost of
computers and a tougher corporate attitudes to IT investment. Overall, the
PC market grew by a relatively modest 7.1 per cent to reach Dollars 46.5bn
in 1992, says Dataquest. However, European PC suppliers experienced a surge
in demand in the second half of 1992 which left some manufacturers,
including Compaq and Apple scrambling to keep up with orders.
While the European PC market grew by about 11 per cent, the main feature of
the market in 1992 was the outbreak of an unbridled price war. Compaq is
widely credited with triggered the action. Having watched the clone-makers
such as Dell in the US, Elonex in the UK and Vobis in Germany snatch
market-share, Compaq - and then IBM - finally hit back last summer with
substantial price cuts and a new ranges of low-price models which have
proved highly successful.
THE result was an orgy of price-cutting with many PC prices dropping by 40
per cent or more in 1992 - a decline that was only arrested in the UK in the
autumn by sterling's devaluation. The big winners are the customers, but
margins have been cut to the bone and a handful of clone manufacturers have
gone out of business.
Until recently, most observers had expected that, with shipments remaining
strong, prices in Europe at least might begin to stabilise this year, but
that PCs manufacturers would continue to add power and new features. But
earlier this month Compaq again cut the prices of its PC in the US by up to
20 per cent, sparking fears of a new price war.
Compaq is still considering whether to make corresponding cuts in Europe.
Yet, as so often happens with an industry which is barely a decade old, the
future probably holds at least as many surprises we have seen in the past.

Software becomes the key success factor - Telecommunications in transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGY has provided the building blocks for the telecommunications
systems of the 1990s, but the industry will enter the next century shaped as
much by political and economic forces which are pushing towards
privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation, writes Paul Taylor.
Highly protected national post and telecommunications organisations (PTOs)
controlled most domestic and international telecommunications traffic until
recently and had little incentive to improve efficiency, introduce new
services or cut customer charges.
But in the the wake of the court-appointed break-up of the Bell system in
the US in the early 1980s other countries, led by the UK in Europe and Japan
in the Far East, have begun to adopt policies designed to foster
competition.
The results have been impressive. In those countries which have liberalised
their telecom regimes, competition has led to a wider range of higher
quality services, lower prices and larger markets.
In Europe, however, liberalisation and privatisation have been a largely
British phenomenon so far. But this may be about to change.
The UK remains the only EC country with two PTOs, although Germany and
France have both introduced competition into mobile telephony and satellite
links. Most countries, including Germany, also have full or partial
privatisation plans for their PTOs. In Germany, for example, talks between
the coalition government and the opposition on the privatisation of Deutsche
Telekom, the German state telephone monopoly, re-opened earlier this month.
At the regional level, the European Commission is just completing nearly six
months of consultations with the industry, consumers, regulators and member
states on the future direction of EC telecommunications policy.
The Commission has long advocated liberalisation but has only been able to
proceed at the pace of its slowest member. So far, it has only required
competition in terminal equipment and data services and not in basic voice
telephony - which represents the bulk of the Ecu 110bn European telecoms
market.
Publication of a Commission report on future telecommunications policy was
twice delayed last summer, partly because of concern about its impact on the
French Maastricht referendum. When it was finally published in October it
laid out four options for the next wave of legislation, ranging from doing
nothing to full liberalisation.
Initially, commissioners favoured a cautious approach, opening cross-border
calls within the EC to competition as a first step. However, senior
Commission officials now appear to believe the next wave of EC telecoms
legislation should go further.
They have been encouraged by signs that the mood of the industry is
gradually changing towards supporting the opening all telecommunications
traffic to competition, albeit with competition phased over a period as long
as 10 years.
IN its response, BT urged the Commission to open the European telecoms
market to free competition by issuing a directive that would force
liberalisation on EC members by January 1, 1995.
Mercury Communications took a slightly less strident view, emphasising that
while it supports moves towards rapid liberalisation of public voice
services and underlying infrastructure throughout the Community, it also
believes that process should be phased in beginning with measures to allow
competition for cross-border voice services and infrastructure, followed by
full liberalisation of national and international voice services and
infrastructure.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, argues that in
order to foster competition new entrants 'need time to establish their
operations.' Thus, Mercury emphasises that regulation plays a crucial role
in bridging the gap between monopoly and effective competition in order to
ensure that customers are protected from abuse of market power, and that
market conditions encourage the introduction of effective and economic
competition.
A decision on whether to press for a full liberalisation and harmonisation
of voice telephony in the EC is due around mid-May and will be taken by the
17 commissioners, advised by Mr Martin Bangemann, EC commissioner for
industry and telecommunications, and Mr Karel van Miert, responsible for
competition.
The outcome is a matter of considerable speculation at present, not least
because Mr Bangemann has only recently added responsibility for
telecommunications policy to his industry portfolio and Mr van Miert, a
Belgian socialist, has recently taken over competition policy from Sir Leon
Brittan.
In the meantime, the EC faces a more immediate challenge over public
procurement policy from the US. The new Clinton administration has
threatened to block EC companies from bidding for millions of dollars' worth
of US government contracts in retaliation for what the US says is EC
discrimination against US sales of telecommunications and power-generating
equipment.
Trade friction could also delay or derail plans by equipment manufacturers
and telecommunications operators on both sides of the Atlantic to compete
directly against each other as part of their emerging global strategies.
For example, Northern Telecom, the Canadian equipment manufacturer, has
established a strong presence in Europe following its acquisition of STC,
and Bell Canada's parent BCE has acquired a 20 per cent stake in Mercury
Communications. As part of that deal, Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent,
has become a partner in BCE's UK cable TV business. In addition, a number of
US-based companies have won mobile telephony licences in Europe.
However, particular attention is focused on BT's emerging global strategy.
The group already has already established Syncordia, an Atlanta,
Georgia-based network management company, and earlier this month applied to
the US regulatory authorities for permission to operate domestic and
international telephone services in the US.
If approval is given, it will clear the way for BT to become the first
international telecommunications operator able to provide multinational
customers with a broad range of voice, data and video services between the
US and the UK.
However the application faces stiff opposition from BT's US competitors,
AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint, who are likely to argue that US carriers do not enjoy
a similar freedom to operate in the UK. The outcome of BT's application will
therefore depend on discussions over reciprocal market access between the US
Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and
Industry.
In the UK market itself, BT still has over 90 per cent of the domestic
market eight years after privatisation and 10 years after Mercury
Communications began opertions. However, the duopoly faces new competition
from domestic and foreign-owned competitors in the wake of 1991 review
conducted by Oftel, the industry regulator.
Last month, Ionica, a Cambridge-based company backed by institutional and
corporate shareholders, was licensed to set up a radio-based rival national
telephone service. Ionica aims to win five per cent of its target household
and small business markets within 10 years. As many as 30 more license
applications are being considered by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Oftel plans to ease some licence conditions for new entrants to the telecoms
marketplace, in particular newcomers are not expected to have any social or
universal service obligations.
Moves like this are designed to keep up the pressure on BT's dominant market
position. As Mr Bill Wigglesworth, deputy director of Oftel said recently:
'When you move to unlimited competition, market dominance is the issue. That
means BT should be licensed more tightly.'
However, BT has been protesting loudly about what it considers to be
excessive regulatory control. More cynical observers have suggested that
BT's grumbles have been timed to co-incide with the arrival at the start of
next month of Oftel's new director general, Mr Don Cruickshank.
Among his first tasks, Mr Cruickshank will have to tackle the contentious
issue of imposing accounting separation on BT. This is considered vital in
securing fair agreements for other telecom companies which need to connect
into BT's network.
In the UK, therefore, as elsewhere, it seems that politics and regulations
will continue to play a big role in determining the competitive landscape.
This is likely to become more - rather than less - true in the future
because the telecommunications business is undergoing a fundamental
transformation - with the emphasis shifting away from facilities-based
carriers with large networks, such as BT and AT&amp;T.
As Mercury's Mr Rhodes noted in a recent speech: 'It is software, rather
than hardware which is becoming the critical success factor.' This means
that ownership of the physical infrastructure will be relatively less
important in the future and the development - and deployment - of
software-based products will become even more critical.
'Technology per se, particularly in an era of open interfaces and standards,
is unlikely to be an enduring source of competitive advantage,' said Mr
Rhodes.

Opinions differ on costs - New generation server-workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE ageing characters in a long-running soap opera, mainframe computers
have been written off and written out of the IT buyers' script.
Today's buyers, weaned on media stars such as PCs and local area networks,
are clamouring for the new generation server-workstation architectures,
architectures that combine the two. But the server-workstation architecture
is nothing new. It's nothing more than distributed data processing in the
Emperor's new clothes. So why all the excitement?
There are three key reasons why the rush to server-workstation architectures
has accelerated in the past year:
First, it gives users greater control over data. Instead of massive
databases, traditionally untouchable by end-users, data is instantly
accessible at the departmental level, and in real-time. Users can now have
their executive information where and when they need it, and they can get at
it through an easy-to-use front-end, often their own desktop PC.
Secondly, today's users are more computer literate, more sophisticated in
what they want from computing and more demanding of IT staff. Now, it's not
unusual for the financial director to be intimately involved with the search
for and selection of IT systems.
And finally there is cost: cost of ownership, as you might expect, but also
cost-savings in use. Opinions differ widely, though, on server-workstation
costs and some users prefer to retain and maintain existing mainframe
systems, rather than ditch them in favour of distributed systems.
THOSE companies that have ditched mainframes in favour of clusters of
workstations have mixed stories to tell. Some have been forced to revive the
mainframe link before it was severed completely because the new systems
couldn't cope.
Others, however, such as EBC Amro, have successfully replaced clusters of
minis or mainframes with networks of PCs hooked up to file servers. Up to a
point, it is fairly straightforward to mirror the physical storage and
processing characteristics of a mainframe with networked PCs and file
servers.
In this way, users can see 'downsizing,' the marketing executives' latest
jargon, as a form of systems integration. Here the traditional DP department
exchanges centralised control for centralised systems management.
Benefits for the user should include more effective support, frequent
upgrades and lower system costs. And those cost savings can be remarkable,
says the National Computing Centre.
One member-company reports a saving of around Pounds 200,000 a year in
maintenance costs alone, as a direct result of downsizing. There seems to be
no apparent loss of capacity or functionality, it claims.
Nick Evans, chairman of the British Computer Society's Client Server Group
claims that cost savings can be phenomenal - 'we surveyed one leisure
services company that could cut its costs by 75 per cent overall,' he says.
There were even larger savings to be made for companies that could stop
leasing their mainframe systems to switch into server workstation
architectures. But cost-savings should be questioned closely by users
intending to tread the client-server route.
'Anyone who buys client-server systems to save money is in for a shock,'
says Peter Stuart, marketing strategy manager for ICL's midrange systems.
Combining hardware, software and integration costs can sometimes exceed the
value of a small mainframe system, he suggests. Though he is quick to point
ou t that the switch does save money in the medium to long-term, by offering
better performance.
'What is good about client-server is that users can invest incrementally, a
step at a time,' he adds, 'so there can be a cost-saving in that sense.'
Henry Brysh, a senior communications consultant at the National Computing
Centre, believes that users should question vendors closely on costs.
'What they don't tell you is there are hidden costs, mainly to do with
integrating the whole system.'
In the past, users bought mainframes from IBM, ICL or Unisys, for example,
and operations managers were comfortable with the technology. In addition,
they had a stable relationship with their suppliers.
'Now,' says Mr Brysh, 'users are buying the systems, specifying the
commodities, and they're responsible for driving the whole thing.'
IN SHORT, the focus has shifted away from the performance of key hardware or
software, and towards the overall performance of the entire network.
'When you find the three distributed databases you've got linked together
don't work,' he asks, 'who do you turn to?'
But cost is a complex issue. It hardly seems fair to compare a Unix box at
Pounds 30,000 with a mainframe at Pounds 500,000, but Mr Brysh believes
these hidden costs must be measured if users are to make a fair comparison
between the systems.
Fortunately for users, a survey by KPMG, a management consultant, has gone
some way towards measuring these costs.
The survey - of workstation users at companies such as Ford, National
Westminster Bank and Refuge Assurance - has revealed that the annual cost of
running workstations is almost Pounds 6,000 per machine. Of this, over 90
per cent represents hidden support costs, claims the report.
'I was asked to speak on a lecture tour by one systems and software vendor,'
says Geoff Jarvis, a principal consultant at KPMG. 'The vendor was obviously
trying to migrate its 10-12,000 customers on to Unix boxes, claiming it
would be a tenth of the cost. I had to say 'Hold on a minute' and was nearly
booed off the tour.'
It is no surprise that vendors are so excited about client-server - even IBM
has pitched in to the market, and it is looking for a sizeable portion of
the business.
'Compared with the traditional mainframe business, this is a much broader
opportunity,' says Nicholas Donofrio, IBM Enterprise Systems general
manager.
'It's a Dollars 150bn market, which will grow at about 7 per cent over the
next five years.'
There are three main barriers for users wishing to adopt server-workstation
architectures, according to market research company Ovum:
A shortage of skills.
The immaturity and unreliability of the LAN environment.
And the lack of support and development tools.
Today's users are demanding application development tools to run in the
client-server environment, but they also need management tools, tools to
support the mainframe, as well as multi-vendor platforms.
In particular, users need tools for systems and network management.
Perhaps the over-riding concern for users is for better service and support
from hardware and software vendors. In a client-server environment, problems
are much tougher to identify and isolate.
Allocating them to one vendor over another could prove impossible. So users
need a one-stop shop for their IT systems, a shop that can support
multi-vendor systems from desktop PCs to backroom mainframes.
Thus, servers and workstations clearly have their place as the distributed
databases of tomorrow, although the questions of cost and effective support
cannot be ignored by the concerned user.
'I'm not firing the flare on client-server,' says Henry Brysh of the
National Computing Centre.
'It is effective when people decide it can help their business. But it
shouldn't be undertaken just because the chief executive or the finance
director has been playing golf with the wrong person.'

COMPUTERS are progressing to the point that they can accept a user's wish as
their command, writes Peggy Salz-Trautman.
Scientists at several research laboratories in the US, Japan and Austria
have moved beyond the keyboard, the mouse and the joystick, and progressed
to experimenting with so-called 'mind-over-cursor' technology - a by-product
of the bio-cybernetics program began by the US Defense Department in the
late 1970s - which enables specially trained individuals to use a computer
without uttering a sound or moving a muscle.
It is claimed that interaction between a brain and a computer is possible
thanks to the advance of electro-encephalography, or EEC, the technique of
attaching electrodes to the scalp. Signals collected by EEC, signals which
are emitted by the brain as it works, can now be passed on to computers
whose job it is to analyse them.
In practice, a person fitted with a slew of cables and a helmet which could
easily belong to either an officer of Star Fleet Command or a member of the
local swim team, focuses his total concentration on a series of letters or a
particular command - and the computer obeys the order.
According to a recent report in The New York Times, University of Illinois
psychologists have developed a way of allowing people to type, albeit at a
rate of only 2.3 characters a minute, by spelling out words in their minds.
Researchers at Fujitsu, Japan's largest personal computer manufacturer, take
this a step further. They are developing super-sensitive brain-wave
detectors, or Squids (which stands for 'superconducting quantum interference
device') to interface between the silent speech of the brain and the program
language of a computer.
For Prof. Kevin Warwick, expert on cybernetics at Britain's Reading
University, one-to-one interaction between a brain and a computer is 'not
science fiction and not yet science fact.'

Looking to the next century - Research: future systems will feature full
motion video, graphics, sound and voice recognition, virtual reality, text
and data processing - with a global communications capability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTING and telecommunications industries are combining with a third
sector, consumer electronics, to spend billions of dollars a year in
research and development, creating a worldwide web of instant infotainment
for the next century.
Infotainment systems 20 years from now will combine multimedia facilities
far superior to today's primitive devices - featuring full motion video,
graphics, sound and voice recognition, virtual reality, text and data
processing - with a global communications capability based largely on fibre
optics. Miniature models will be wristwatch video-diary-communicators,
linked into the network by radio.
Until now, domestic consumers have had virtually no influence on the
technical development of computing and relatively little on
telecommunications, compared to business users.
So the new participation of consumer electronics companies, particularly the
Japanese giants such as Sony and Matsushita, in information technology
represents a fundamental change that could turn out to be as important as
the convergence of computing and communications.
During the 1980s, when sales of personal computers into American homes were
disappointing, Apple gave priority to its commercial customers, in R&amp;D as
well as marketing. Now John Sculley, Apple's chairman, is redirecting the
company's Californian research centre to prepare for what he predicts will
be a Dollars 3,000bn combined global market in consumer electronics,
computing and communications by the year 2000.
Even executives of IBM, the archetypal business-oriented corporation, are
now talking enthusiastically about the coming consumer market. IBM's
personal computer laboratories in Florida are racing to develop a Personal
Digital Assistant.
PDAs (alternatively known as PICs - Personal Intelligent Communicators) are
often seen as forerunners of the convergence of the three Cs. Apple's
forthcoming Newton is the best publicised example so far.
This year the first PDAs will be launched - hand-held mobile devices capable
of simple data communications as well as voice telephony and fax. They will
include an electronic diary and address book. The user 'writes' information
into a PDA with an electronic pen, instead of a miniature keyboard.
The three-way convergence is made possible, of course, by the rapid advance
of technology in computing, communications and electronics. But the pace of
progress is far from even.
On the whole, hardware is developing more quickly than the software required
to control and make use of it. As Peter Cochrane, head of systems research
at BT Laboratories in the UK, puts it, 'the biggest single problem with
software science and engineering is the almost total lack of any science and
engineering.' There are no fundamental principles underlying software
development, comparable to the laws of science and mathematics that hardware
designers can follow. The consequence is that hugely complicated software is
required to achieve relatively simple tasks. Cochrane points out that the
line code for a simple telephone switchboard today runs to about one
kilometre of paper  - more than twice as long as the complete works of
Shakespeare.
Software is therefore becoming less and less reliable (as the increasing
frequency of telecom network failures shows) while hardware becomes more
reliable.
Even within the general area of hardware, some technologies are moving much
faster than others. A serious constraint on the development of mobile
communicators is the failure to improve significantly the energy storage
capacity of batteries. Display screens are advancing faster than batteries
but they also represent a frustrating bottleneck.
The mainstream computer technologies are making spectacular progress, though
data storage capacity and ease of access are not advancing quite as fast as
processing power.
But perhaps the greatest leap forward of all over the past decade or so has
been in bandwidth - the carrying capacity of communications channels - as
optical fibres replace copper cables. Recent discoveries in opto-electronics
make it possible to transmit information equivalent to billions of telephone
conversations in light pulses down a single glass strand as thin as a human
hair.
In contrast, the twisted pairs of copper wires that still connect most of
the world's telephone subscribers to the network cannot carry much more than
one conversation. They are incapable of transmitting full-motion video,
however cleverly the information content of the pictures is 'compressed.'
Telecoms companies in industrialised countries are rapidly replacing their
trunk cables with fibre but it will be many years before all individual
subscribers are linked in. Then, at last, everyone will be able to abandon
what Cochrane calls our 'copper mind sets' and make imaginative use of
instant infotainment.
The dominant flavour of convergence research is inevitably
Japanese-American, though European companies are playing important
subsidiary roles, such as Philips in multimedia and GEC in
videoconferencing.
The US telecoms giant AT&amp;T - resurgent commercially and scientifically in
the 1990s after a disappointing patch in the 1980s - is emerging as one of
the most important players. It spends Dollars 3.2bn a year on R&amp;D at its
world-famous Bell Labs, based in New Jersey, and turns out patented
inventions at a rate of more than one a day, focusing on micro-electronics,
photonics (light-based communications and computing) and software.
AT&amp;T's strong technical position has been strengthened by recent mergers,
particularly the take-over of NCR in 1991. The company is a leader in the
PDA movement through its stake in EO Inc, a Californian start-up company
also backed by Mitsubishi of Japan. The EO Personal Communicator uses a
processor chip designed by AT&amp;T, called the Hobbit, which will be
incorporated in similar products from NEC and Toshiba.
As the EO-Hobbit alliances show, the technical development of infotainment
is underpinned by a growing web of international collaboration, involving
corporate giants and innovative start-ups. Not even the strongest companies
like AT&amp;T and IBM can cover convergence with their own R&amp;D resources.

Boost for productivity - Manufacturing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY SALZ-TRAUTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS manufacturing industry has sought in recent years to boost production and
cut costs, it has often turned to the technocrats for solutions. Managers
have believed that investment in information systems (IS) and manufacturing
technologies alone would improve the production process - the rest would
take care of itself.
This limited view, according to the Frankfurt-based consultancy Diebold
Germany, has led to further problems for industry - 'technology has changed
the manufacturing process forever, but manufacturers have failed to change
with it,' comments the managing director of Diebold Germany, Mr Wolfgang
Dernbach.
Management has insisted on 'putting the spotlight on automation,' he adds,
'but has often forgotten where human resources can and must fit in.'
Computerised information offers tantalising benefits in the automated
processes used in manufacturing. Plant managers have been increasingly
excited by innovations such as MRP (materials resource planning); JIT
('just-in-time' updating of stock levels); OPT (optimised production
technology); EDI (electronic data interchange - the exchange of data between
manufacturers, suppliers and customers); CAD, CAM and CAE (computer-aided
design, manufacturing and engineering); and PIM (product information
management), plus other buzzwords described below.
Wolfgang Dernbach argues that if manufacturing technology is to provide a
company with really productive solutions, 'then it had better be installed
in such a way as to actively include - and not exclude - the workforce.'
In short, man and not the machine must be at the centre.
At the Regensburg plant of BMW, Germany's leading motor manufacturer, Johann
Schrafl, the head of product engineering, has a policy of 'targeted
automation' which makes good business sense. In the late 1980s, Schrafl and
his colleagues began to look for ways to make the assembly line more
'intelligent' and, at the same time, relieve workers of tedious tasks.
Rather than automate the entire production process, Schrafl chose to
'selectively' install manufacturing technologies without bypassing the
individual.
'Machines will always make mistakes,' he stresses. 'And people will always
be necessary to correct them.
To help accomplish the company goal, BMW purchased a system from Robert
Bosch, one of Germany's leading electronics companies. The system relies on
an electronic spindle mechanism to attach and tighten all five screws on
each vehicle wheel at one time - and 'feel' if the screws are tight enough.
This improvement cuts production time per vehicle by 1.4 minutes which
translates into cash-savings for the factory of DM200,000 a year.
In addition, workers are spared having to lift a machine weighing 50lbs to
tighten screws. And the Bosch system has built-in quality controls. Whereas
an earlier system at Regensburg only indicated problems with warning lights,
leaving the worker to figure out which wheels had to be corrected, the Bosch
system records mistakes in a production protocol and prints a sticker which
is attached to a quality-control folder that accompanies each car start to
finish on the assembly line.
However, Schrafl sees little reason to be 'euphoric' about the advantages of
automation. New manufacturing technologies, he emphasises, also have their
'drawbacks.' In short, they break down and make mistakes - 'but improvements
in the interface are serving to make intelligent solutions more attractive
to implement.'
For complex industrial projects, analysts argue that the emphasis should be
more product information management (PIM) than just aspects of factory
automation.
Especially in the area of electronics and telecoms, the final version of a
product depends on the priorities of managers, purchasing departments,
logistics supervisors, quality-control groups and inventory directors, as
well as designers and engineers. Because of the spread of PCs and
workstations, more than 50 per cent of product information is in electronic
form - data which can be easily accessed and amended via data transfer
networks.
But the more accessible the data, the greater the risk that the wrong data
can find its way into the product development and manufacturing processes,
bypassing formal release procedures. When this happens, engineering changes
and re-working is then needed, research budgets over-run and quality
declines. In the end, the product fails to reach its market on time - and
the manufacturer pays the price.
Rather than merely introduce more automation into its production processes,
GPT, a leading maker of telecom equipment in the UK, decided to rethink its
entire design and manufacturing routine. As a result, the company in 1990
developed its own engineering manufacturing data system, (EMDS).
This set of computer-integrated applications was designed to provide the
company with a common framework and a single access to all kinds of
information, regardless of platform. In short, EMDS manages all design
files, product configurations, engineering changes and component databases
throughout the product life-cycle.
For GPT, engineering efficiency executive Mr Les Brooks, the EMDS allows the
company to 'successfully manage change.'
Indeed, he adds, 'we are able to make sure we design and build products
right the first time and can properly manage the data generated by both
processes.' Moreover, EMDS plays a significant role in company strategy, he
says. The pay-off for GPT so far is a 'marked improvement' in the
time-to-market and increased capacity to realise concurrent engineering - a
practice where all functions involved in delivering a product to the
customer (from R&amp;D to field service) participate in the development process.
Indeed, analysts agree, GPT is a market leader and well advanced in a
ten-year development project, in collaboration with Siemens, to produce the
next generation of telecom switching systems.
Sherpa, a leading software and services supplier, based in San Jose,
California, is also the world's leading PIM supplier and the company which
provided GPT with the software for its EMDS. Sherpa believes that PIM is the
'next logical step' to CAD, CAM and CAE. According to Sherpa's European
marketing manager, Doug Macdonald, PIM underlines the concept of 'agile
manufacturing' - the flexibility which companies seek.
'Many large companies have invested 'up to the hilt' in computer-aided
design and similar tools, but are stuck struggling to manage this
information manually,' he says.
Not all manufacturers can manage their information electronically, therefore
'a lot of serious, costly mistakes are developing,' he adds. For example, a
large electronics company lost much time and money after engineers sent
outdated product information to the factory floor, resulting in the
manufacture of several hundred useless printed circuit boards - 'problems
like this can happen in even the best-managed companies,' he notes.
For this reason, Macdonald stresses, Sherpa concentrates only on supplying
systems which integrate fully with a company's design and manufacturing
systems.
ACCORDING to the US-based consultancy CIMdata, a company specialising in
product data management (PDM), which is similar to PIN, and CAD/CAM
technology and market issues, Europe has the world's highest growth
potential for PDM systems and services. By 1995, European PDM revenues could
exceed Dollars 250m, similar to the figure for suppliers in North America.
Sherpa will benefit considerably from the trend to more 'intelligent' data
management, says the consultancy.
Looking ahead, business process re-engineering, with the help of new,
integrated production technologies, plus improved information systems, is a
trend that will spread rapidly to manufacturing processes, suggests Michael
Bruce, a director of the London-based Moore Stephens Business Technology
Group.
Meanwhile, Japan's approach to automation generally seeks to avoid
imbalances between new production technologies and manufacturing processes.
Fanuc of Japan, a leader in the automation of machine tools, supports its
internal production process with highly efficient management. Company
engineers, clad in bright yellow uniforms, carry out research in highly
automated laboratories while product managers oversee operations in high
tech factories.
In the electronics plant, for example, robots and computers are assigned
tasks such as parts' inspection, plus assembly and testing of printed
circuit boards. In other futuristic plants, unmanned vehicles and robots
assist each other in the production of machinery. Indeed, robots are at work
 -making robots.
The company, according to one analyst, offers a glimpse 'of where technology
is taking us in the years to come . . . the prime example of the truly
automated factory and the outcome of a fully rational manufacturing
process.'
For Bruce Potts, Fanuc's robotics Europe executive vice-president, based in
Dusseldorf, the 'revolution' in factory automation is in full swing because
the robot control system is becoming more user-friendly.
According to the International Federation of Robotics, the world industrial
robot population in 1991 stood at around 530,000 units.
To date, Fanuc Robotics serve more than 2,000 customers, including leading
players in the automobile, machinery, food and pharmaceutical industries.
But, says Mr Potts, computer-controlled robots and factory automation alone
are not the answer if a manufacturer's problems if the basic production
process is inefficient.
'We have to look at the entire process,' he adds. 'Then we can look for a
solution.'

Suppliers hedge their bets - Network management: what is happening down the
wire?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JUDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER relies on two networks: the power grid it serves, with the
other generating companies, and the computer network with which it controls
its operations. Richard Hawkins has the job of managing the computer
network. It is a job at the sharp end.
The network links the whole of England, and provides business applications
including electronic mail, office functions, spreadsheets, word processing,
databases, and corporate applications including ledgers, purchasing and
operational systems. It also handles performance statistics for the power
stations.
'We rely on the grid to deliver our goods, and we rely on the network to
manage our business works effectively,' says Mr Hawkins. 'It allows us to
assess what our cost base is and do comparisons.'
That, in turn keeps the company competitive with its rivals.
Relying on a network has its risks. Downtime could cost the company dearly,
so it must be kept running reliably. And as needs change, Mr Hawkins has to
keep track of the growth and the costs incurred, as well as finding the most
effective way of linking.
He needs to know when one network section is overloaded with data traffic
and due for expansion, and when another is hardly used, and redundant. He
needs to be able to control parts of the network which may be the other side
of the country. He needs network management, a solution which the IT
industry is only just becoming able to deliver.
Most network management solutions involve a computer workstation attached to
the network, which probes and analyses the data traffic. Sections of the
network have their own responding equipment, which flag up problems and keep
the management system informed of activity.
For tighter control, software is installed in each individual component of
the network, to answer queries from the management station. The user can
then pinpoint any problem, and even control the networked equipment, turning
it off and on, and adjusting settings as required.
But at this point, users hit trouble. Networks don't come from one supplier
any more: the cable may be from one company, while the network software is
from another. The computers attached may be from several more manufacturers,
and so are the devices which link the sections together: hubs, routers,
bridges and the like. As a network grows over the years, the core components
can be bought from different vendors. And it is asking a lot for one
management system to control them all.
When suppliers provide their own software to monitor and control a component
it is usually proprietary. Developed in isolation, it only works with that
supplier's management products. And that leaves users with a dire choice:
leave some sections of the network unmanaged, invest in several separate
management systems, or pull back and limit the equipment on the network to
one brand. The last option leaves the user 'locked-in' to one supplier, who
may raise its prices, and may not even have all the equipment the user
needs.
To some extent, anyone with a large network is locked in at the moment: at
the top of its networking hierarchy, National Power uses AT&amp;T's proprietary
management products. But Richard Hawkins wants to break free from that.
The way to do it is to follow a strategy. There are standards for network
management, just as there are standards for connection, but they are still
in dispute.
Now an industry-wide group is promising to sort the mess out once and for
all.
The first step to network management is usually to ask for the simple
network management protocol (SNMP), a standard from the Internet community.
This means buying network components which can respond to an SNMP manager,
and adding an SNMP-based management system. The set of information which
each component can provide is well agreed, so the chances are that the
manager won't be talking a foreign language to the rest of the network.
Mr Hawkins standardised on SNMP as a first line of attack - 'we have a
centralised network management system with voice and data integrated,
currently based on SNMP,' he says. 'But we are developing a strategy for
system-wide management of all the resources in the IT environment.'
SNMP is not up to that job. The scheme is already showing its limitations.
Mr Hawkins is unlikely to move from it in the short term, but he is not
prepared to rely on it indefinitely, because of its lack of security - and
because suppliers insist on adding their proprietary features to it.
The alternative is from the international standards community, a more
powerful system called CMIP (common management information protocol),
developed with a more theoretical approach. The problem as with other
official standards, is that there are few products.
British Telecom, IBM, AT&amp;T and the other giants are all committed to CMIP,
which is part of the OSI scheme. Although products are on their way, there
is a 'chicken and egg problem.' The suppliers are waiting to be sure there
is a real demand. And while they wait, the users are installing more and
more SNMP, making the market look tougher for CMIP. This puts brakes on a
market which could be one of the fastest growing in the industry.
The answer may come from a group set up to promote management technology.
The Network Management Forum (NMF) hopes to make the two protocols can work
together with its Omnipoint programme, which also brings together the
applications, combining the user interfaces which confront people using the
software.
The scheme has the backing of users and vendors, including all the big
industry groupings and the UK government's IT adviser, the CCTA. Martin Kirk
of the standards pressure group, X/Open, says: 'Two standards, we can live
with - if there were ten, we'd have a problem.'
'We see Omnipoint as a way forward,' says Mr Hawkins. 'It gets away from the
protocol wars: its real role is in dislodging proprietary systems at the top
of the management hierarchy.'
At the CeBIT exhibition in Hanover, NMF will show management applications
working together. This follows a demonstration of the protocols themselves
at the ComNet show in Washington in February, where systems from BT, Ascom
Timeplex, Fujitsu, IBM and others were linked together.
Despite this activity it does seem that the suppliers are still hedging
their bets. BT, IBM and AT&amp;T also showed their products working with
proprietary protocols. Users are also cautious, but it is still possible to
take small steps, given the limitations one is working under.
NM Financial Management in Portsmouth had a network from Digital Equipment,
with 120 host computers and 400 terminals on three sites. The company had a
medium-term plan to swap its whole network for one based on IBM protocols,
and float the IT department off as a separate company. In the short term,
however, it needed to get the best from what it had.
Simon Bierne, then working in-house, went for a simple approach.
He put in an SNMP system and four monitor probes. The system picked up
enough information to pinpoint the network black spots, and helped plan a
reorganisation which reduced the time for the weekly database copy by two
thirds, to under two hours.
For a busy services company, that kind of saving can justify the price tag
of around Pounds 15,000 for a management station, and Pounds 2,000 for each
probe.

Users want more freedom - Open systems: OSI in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JUDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is mounting for governments to open up their definition of open
systems. The policy of requiring systems based on 'official' standards has
had mixed results and users in the public sector have begun to demand
freedom to adopt the technology they want.
Since the 1980s, users in the public sector have been required to adopt
network products based on the official OSI standards. But some of those
standards have had little impact in the market, and other technology has
been more practical.
'Back in 1989 or so, we believed everything that was said - that there would
be no alternative, and OSI would be a panacea to all our ills,' says Len
Graves, county information technology (IT) officer at Essex County Council.
'Now, we are frustrated. The deliverable has never really materialised.'
In the 1980s, the European Commission was forging ahead towards its 1992
target for a common market and, beyond that, to greater unity.
Goods and people had to move freely around Europe, and to provide public
services on a European basis, government departments and other public bodies
had to work together. To achieve this, the governments' IT systems had to
have a common language. At the time, IBM and the other suppliers were using
their own communications protocols, which limited the choice users had, and
cut them off from other users' systems.
The international standards bodies were working on standards for open
systems interconnection (OSI), which promised to solve this.
Whatever systems you had, once the suppliers installed OSI communications,
they would communicate with each other.
In 1987, the European Commission passed a Decision, stating that all public
procurements above a certain value must refer to international standards.
The Decision required the OSI standards for communications.
The move was meant to kick-start an OSI market. If the whole public sector
asked for the same thing, suppliers would change their proprietary ways.
Public bodies would be able to communicate with each other, and have free
choice of the systems they bought.
The private sector would follow. Free communications would make European
businesses stronger and more competitive.
That was the theory; in practice, the standards were almost unworkable. They
included a vast number of options, and there was no guarantee that products
would communicate.
To deal with this, the European standards community took on more work.
Tighter standards, called profiles, were defined, along with conformance
tests which would establish whether a product met a particular profile.
The UK government's IT adviser, CCTA, weighed in with the Government OSI
Profile (GOSIP), a procurement guide which helps users buy products which
work with other GOSIP products. A European handbook on open systems (EPHOS)
based on GOSIP, is under development.
Up to a point, this has worked. OSI protocols have been in development for
13 years, and there are now products available which do work together. But
they are finding, like Rip van Winkle waking from his long sleep, that
things have changed.
OSI was designed to tackle problems which are no longer so serious. Vendors,
suffering from recession and technical change, cannot impose their will on
users so easily, and are co-operating more readily. In the 1980s 'industry
standards' were imposed by single suppliers, and OSI opposed them; in the
1990s, industry standards are developed by consortia with much the same
goals as the standards bodies.
Ironically, users acknowledged this situation more quickly than the
authorities. When users in the public sector were required to adopt open
systems and standards, they responded by buying systems based on the
emerging operating system, UNIX, which communicates with the TCP/IP
protocols.
It is claimed that TCP/IP and related network protocols have inferior
features to the equivalent OSI standards. What they do have is a proven
track record, and easy availability.
Whatever the technical merits, many public sector users would rather have an
80 per cent solution now, than a 99 per cent solution in five years. But
they are saying it privately, because the EC decision requires them to have
an OSI strategy. The irony is that, although these protocols are excluded
from the policy, because they are not international standards, they actually
provide most of what the EC wanted from OSI in the first place. They offer
easy connections and are free from the control of any one supplier.
Public bodies are meeting the EC's objectives, but they are doing it by
misunderstanding the guidelines, or using loopholes to get what they want.
Fortunately, the decision allows plenty of exceptions. The EC never wanted
to force users to waste money, so other protocols are allowed if
standards-based products are uneconomic over the life of the system, if the
standards are ill-defined or untestable, or if the technology is new and
unproven. They are also allowed, for compatibility with existing systems.
Purchases below 100,000 ECUs are exempt.
Larger bodies are still positive about using the OSI protocols on 'backbone'
networks: 'Most people are persevering,' says Seth Mason, of the National
Health Service's Information Management Centre. 'With the advent of EPHOS
and maturing of GOSIP into two boxed sets, it has become easier to reference
OSI specifications.'
The biggest networks are run by the telecom operators. Like large public
bodies, they look to OSI to solve the big problems, such as global
directories and network management, areas where there is little alternative
work. But in bodies the size of local authorities, there is frustration.
'If it is in reality a waste of time, then it is also a waste of money,'
says Roger Toms, general manager for information systems services at Surrey
County Council. 'If OSI is truly becoming an irrelevance, then they have to
be honest enough to say so, and not force the public sector through an
artificial process, which increases our procurement costs and causes delay.'
Mr Toms fears the OSI requirement could put the local authority's own
departments at a disadvantage in a compulsory competitive tender against
outsiders from the private sector, who are not subject to the same
procurement restrictions.
Often the TCP/IP solution is so much cheaper that it falls beneath the
100,000 ECU threshold, but public sector bodies still have to go through the
lengthy process of claiming exemption. Consultant Ray O'Connor, who has
advised the EC on this issue, says: 'Governmental policy needs to be more
flexible, recognising that OSI has an important role to play, but that it
has little chance of becoming the universal solution which was expected.'
CCTA is opening up its policy a little. Its published guide keeps an
optimistic tone, with a suggested target date of 1994 for a complete
transition to OSI. When advising individual organisations, however, CCTA it
is reported to be more relaxed, and it supports the use of agreed
specifications from industry, such as the Portability Guide from the X/Open
group.
But there is not much hope of a new policy. The EC wants to keep up its
pressure for open systems, of whatever kind, but the Treaty of Rome's
principle of subsidiarity would only allow legislation binding in all the
member-states, in an emergency. There is now no emergency.
It seems all too likely that the present system of lip service to a 1980s
solution will continue. Meanwhile, users will adopt the solutions that
industry provides in the 1990s, which will be a mixture of the available
protocols.

Sales continue to fall - Mainframes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world will only ever need five mainframe computers,' said Thomas Watson,
the founding father of International Business Machines. His prediction, made
many decades ago, may yet come true as sales of the industry's workhorse
'number crunchers' continue to fall.
IBM's 1992 results - one of the worst losses in financial history - are the
final evidence, if any were needed, that the day of the proprietary
mainframe is finally over. Now IBM is intent on capturing the open systems
market, rather than on trying to pen its customers into proprietary systems
architectures.
'Customers are very clear about what they need to solve large problems,'
says Mr Nicholas Donofrio, IBM's Enterprise Systems general manager. 'We are
responding by making our products more open, by further enhancing server
capabilities and by continuing to reduce the total cost of computing on
multiple platforms.'
And the company certainly seems to be opening up its architectures,
announcing open standards as recently as February 1993 for MVS/ESA, a key
IBM mainframe operating system.
Britain's ICL has also announced changes, mainly performance upgrades, to
the System 39SX range, its top-end mainframes. And it, too, has opened up
its mainframe operating system, VME.
ICL's VME, launched in the mid-1970s, is perhaps the youngest of the
mainframe operating systems, and it was relatively easy to fit open
interfaces on top of the operating system software, says Peter Slavid, ICL's
corporate business systems manager.
'We've learned a lot from the Unix environment about openness,' he says,
'and we can apply this to the mainframe environment. But we've also learned
some of the limitations.' Mr Slavid does not believe Unix is yet capable of
managing a very large corporate network, for instance, leaving some room for
potential growth in the mainframe arena.
BESIDE the ageing of the mainframe market, though, there is increasing
pressure on mainframe vendors from the makers of supercomputers. Many
believe, though, that the machines from companies such as Pyramid and
Sequent are probably not as resilient or as fault tolerant as mainframes, or
as effective at archiving and data management, especially if they support
more than a few hundred users.
Of the true supercomputer vendors, such as Cray and other scientific
mainframe suppliers, mainstream mainframe manufacturers seem even less
worried.
'In other European countries, supercomputers are common in commercial
environments,' says Mr Slavid. 'But these people are coming from a
scientific background and these applications are very different from the
banking and commercial applications in Br itain.'
Which means that mainframe manufacturers still have the pick of the UK
market - for the present, at least.
A problem with that UK market, though, is price. Once unassailable, the
prices of mainframe systems are tumbling now like PC prices at sale time.
'With the commoditisation of the market, mainframes are now just boxes,'
says John Perkins, a director at the National Computing Centre. 'There is
intense pressure on the margins of mainframe suppliers who are being
attacked on all sides,' he says. 'That's inescapeable.'
This explains the switch in focus of hardware vendors, away from hardware
sales and into software and services. IBM, ICL and Digital among others are
all becoming service-oriented suppliers.
The watchword is 'solutions.' One remaining demand for mainframe systems, a
demand that will keep sales trickling in for some time, is the requirement
for large transaction processing systems. Mainframe systems in banks and
building societies effectively operate as country and even continent-wide
networks. Trying to replace these with a distributed network of Unix boxes
may mean saying goodbye to processing power and security.
'It's important to remember that we have learned a lot of lessons in the
mainframe market over the last 30 years,' says John Perkins. 'For many
people, mainframes represent a significant investment of time, money and
effort. This is not something they will throw away lightly.'
But that is exactly what many users are considering. In a 1992 survey
conducted by the NCC, over 55 per cent of its members - representing 584
medium to large computer installations and over two million staff - have
already considered downsizing and a further 11 per cent plan to do so within
two years.
The main reason users are looking to move away from mainframes is their
initial cost, but ease of access and flexibility of use are also important
to today's increasingly sophisticated users.
The result for mainframe vendors will be a 31 per cent cut in the number of
mainframes in the coming year. They will be replaced chiefly by
super-minicomputers and intelligent workstations.
Perhaps the most important, often forgotten factor companies should consider
when downsizing is corporate culture.
Clearly, a decentralised, distributed IT system is not the best solution for
a hierarchical and highly centralised organisation. In companies such as
this, service to the user will deteriorate and cost-savings will evaporate
in a flood of corrective measures designed to remedy an irremediable
solution.
Further problems may arise for users with the change in skills needed among
IT service personnel. The key problem here is that software development
platforms will move away from the traditional mainframe database management
systems and ever closer to the PC-based database systems and fourth
generation languages of the Unix world.
In the medium-term, therefore, skills issues will become increasingly
central to the drive away from mainframes.
In the short-term, however, downsizing will continue, as will the fall in
price. And to combat the drainage, away from mainframes and into open,
Unix-based systems, hardware companies will continue evolving into software
and service companies.
'The hardware companies will continue to move into the service business as
fast as they can,' says Doug Eyeions, secretary of the Computing Services
Association.
IBM, ICL and Digital Equipment all make more money from software and
services today than they do from hardware sales. This may suggest a sudden
death for the mainframe, but its future for the time being is assured.
'The mainframe is still good at cost-effectively sharing large volumes of
data among large numbers of users,' says Peter Stuart, marketing strategy
manager for ICL's mid-range systems. Large scale applications such as
airline reservation systems will stay on mainframes, he suggests. Doug
Eyeions agrees: 'For the rest of this decade we will still need mainframes
as database drivers on very large applications, but that's all.'
But what about the future?
In the long-term, it seems, mainframes will becoming corporate data centres,
massive repositories of data. But to get at the data, users will be managing
a transparent network of Unix boxes. And what do users think of this
diagnosis?
'In the long-term, Northern Electric's strategy is to move away from
proprietary mainframe platforms,' says Peter Wadham, programme manager for
integrated billing services at Northern Electric. 'At the moment, though,
the size, availability and processing power of Unix boxes just isn't there.'
The users seem to agree.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (1): New
era of global networks - The increasing convergence of the computer and
communication technologies is a powerful driver of globalisation, enabling
companies to capture economies of scale by eliminating barriers of time and
space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION of computers and communications is a marriage made in heaven. Yet
while the banns have been read many times over the past two decades,
consummation has been a slow process.
The reasons are both cultural and technical, but today there is renewed
optimism that a new era in information processing systems is about to unfold
as a result of the convergence of the two most powerful modern technologies.
Computers and digital (computer language) communications lie at the heart of
information technology; computers realise their full potential only when
connected in networks; telecommunications systems based on digital
technology are infinitely more flexible and powerful than their analogue
cousins.
Together, they are a powerful driver of globalisation, enabling companies to
capture economies of scale by eliminating barriers of time and space.
The telecom and computer industries, however, have separate origins and
history. Telecoms stretches back into the last century; the industry grew up
with traditions of regulation, monopoly power and a duty to maintain and
protect the network.
The computer industry grew out of research into scientific calculation and,
in the 1950s, it was grafted onto the mature office equipment business which
it then proceeded to cannibalise.
Telecom companies and computer companies have often been seen as competitors
rather than allies. In the 1980s, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, and
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
seemed set for a battle royal as AT&amp;T established a computer division and
IBM bought Rolm, a promising telecoms manufacturer.
In the end, it proved to be a phoney war. AT&amp;T bought NCR two years ago to
rationalise its loss-making computer business; IBM sold Rolm to Siemens of
Germany in 1989.
According to Mr Alan Willsher, managing director of GPT Communications
Systems, owned jointly by GEC of the UK and Siemens of Germany, the moves
were premature: 'They came in too early before digital public-switched
networks had been properly established. Ten years on, most developed
countries have a good digital system'.
Among other developments which are creating optimism that the rate of
convergence of computers and communications is speeding up include:
Pressure on national telecommunications authorities to deregulate and
liberalise their services. The US is the world's most deregulated
telecommunications market; the UK leads in Europe. The European Commission
seems set to put pressure on the remaining European nations to speed up the
process, buoyed by a European Court of Justice decision that the commission
has the right to compel member-states to deregulate certain telecom
services.
LIBERALISATION is seen by many as the key to the new era of information
technology. According to Mr William Marx, writing in a colloquium report* to
be published later this year: 'The liberalisation of trade and of regulation
and the formulation of policies that bolster market-based economies will
hasten the expansion and modernisation of global networks and at the same
time deliver to individuals, companies and government, the full benefits of
information technology.'
Growth of distributed data processing, more commonly described now as
client-server computing. This is a direct consequence of the increasing
power of microprocessor chips and the declining cost of computing. For many
applications today it makes economic sense to distribute processing through
a network of personal computers, or clients, with more powerful systems -
servers - providing network management and control, database services and a
reservoir of computing power.
A consequence has been a decline in the use of traditional mainframe
computers with deleterious effects on the profit and loss accounts of
mainframe vendors such as IBM and Groupe Bull.
Client-server designs are not for everybody, however. A survey carried out
among delegates to City IT, a conference held in London, showed worries
about the difficulty of building and managing networks, fears of losing
control of data and data security and concern for the technical inadequacies
of personal computers - 'it is back to the dark ages,' one delegate said
'All the things mainframe people have known for the past 20 years, PCs do
not have.'
A market for mobile, radio-based telecommunications growing explosively.
Building on the success of the earlier, analogue cellular telephones,
suppliers are preparing to launch digital voice and data services. The
pan-European Groupe Speciale Mobile will provide the digital infrastructure
for a personal communications network.
The use of digital technology in these networks will make possible new and
sophisticated services while making better use of the available frequency
spectrum.
A further factor is the growth of distributed multimedia systems - the
convergence of sound, data, static image and video.
Many believe that multimedia will emerge as the dominant mass technology of
the next century. The pace of change is being driven by the evolution of
optical storage, which is making possible the capture of huge volumes of
information on a disc only a few centimetres wide. A single disc, for
example, can hold all the text and graphics from a 21 volume encyclopaedia
set.
However, as Mr David Hutchison of Lancaster University in the UK pointed out
recently,** the telecoms authorities control the spread and adoption of
multimedia applications - 'high telecommunications prices will hinder
applications rollout. This is because multimedia traffic will require high
bandwidths (transmission capacity): a single digital video stream offering
full colour and motion may require two million bits per second even when
compressed, using the most advanced techniques.'
The growth of digital networks is changing the balance of power within the
sector. Telecom companies, in particular, are showing a renewed interest in
computer firms. This time round, however, their interest is in services
companies. Nynex, for example, one of the US 'Baby Bells' bought the UK
computing services company BIS, while AT&amp;T bought Istel, the former data
processing unit of the Rover car group. France Telecom has invested in the
Anglo-French Sema Group, while there are tenacious rumours that BT of the UK
has an interest in acquiring a stake in EDS, the large General Motors
subsidiary.
This is a reflection of the fact that computer hardware has become
essentially a commodity, yielding a low gross profit margin of perhaps less
than 20 per cent. Computing services offer faster growth and a more
reasonable margin and are a better fit with the nature of the telecoms
business with its emphasis on service and customer satisfaction.
One of the more exciting developments in the past two years has been the
emergence of 'personal communicators,' hand-held devices which combine the
functions of telephone handset with computer and facsimile machine. AT&amp;T is
at the forefront of one such development working with the Californian
company EO; the Japanese organisations Matsushita and Marubeni; and
Olivetti, the Italian computer company.
According to Mr Elserino Piol, Olivetti vice-chairman, a leading IT company
these days has no choice but to enter the market for personal communicators.
Other companies developing personal communicators or 'personal digital
assistants' include IBM, Apple and, in the UK, Amstrad.
The importance of personal communicators and their desk-bound equivalents is
the emergence of the 'broadband' society where individuals have access to
virtually unlimited amounts of information.
Mr Marx* sketches the likely future: 'Universal access to information and
the relatively inexpensive cost of transmitting it, offer the potential to
create a worldwide entrepreneurial revolution to rival the one that followed
the personal computer.'

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running debate in the market whether Lasmo will maintain or cut its
dividend when it announces its preliminary figures tomorrow, moved strongly
in favour of those suggesting the payment will be held.
At the close Lasmo shares were 4 higher at 187p on reasonably good turnover
of 1.1m shares.
Lasmo shares came under substantial pressure last year as concern about
gearing, resulting from the acquisition of Ultramar, saw the stock price
fall to 117p.
Bank shares fell along with the market, Barclays slipping 15 to 410p,
NatWest 14 to 431p and Lloyds 12 to 518p.
Merchant banks, on the other hand, drew comfort from the highly encouraging
results published by Morgan Grenfell, now controlled by Deutsche Bank, which
followed on from excellent numbers from Schroders. Hambros edged up 3 to
348p, while Schroders jumped 22 more to 1975p.
Britannic Assurance fell 40 to 1303p amid mild disappointment with the
figures. Prudential, due to announce preliminary numbers this morning, gave
up 8 to 326p. Of the composites Sun Alliance dropped 9 to 352p with a block
of 2m shares traded at 356p.
BT fell 12 to 411p, with investors worried by the prospect of a price war in
the mobile phone market, triggered by Mercury's new PCN network. Securicor
'A', BT's partner in the Cellnet cellular phone business, fell 6 to 612p.
Vodafone were also affected, sliding 9 to 390p.
The dividend reduction hit P-E International which dropped 8 to 50p.
Figures from Argos were in line with expectations, but the market was
encouraged by a positive trading statement. The upgrades that followed fell
into the range of Pounds 76-83m for the coming year, although one analysts
view of the stock as 'worthy but dull,' was echoed by a number of others.
The shares gained 10 to 315p in turnover of 1.1m.
Newspaper vendors continued to be buoyed by the decision by the chancellor
of the exchequer not to impose VAT on newspapers. WH Smith 'A' was steady at
434p and J Menzies added 2 to 476p.
A rash of research on the food retail business, largely concentrated on the
impact of discount stores, produced further cautious sentiment in the
sector. Goldman Sachs suggested that while the majors were likely to
continue their expansion, competitive pressure would increase as the
discount chains fought for market share. However, the house likes Argyll
Group because of its exposure to the discount sector through its Lo-Cost
chain of stores.
Only Iceland Frozen Foods, which reports results today, managed to buck the
trend, the shares climbing 4 to 735p. The group signalled its expectations -
profits of at least Pounds 55m and a full-year dividend of 10p - when it
bought 48 stores from Littlewoods recently. Elsewhere, Argyll Group declined
6 1/2 to 353p, Kwik Save 9 to 815p, J Sainsbury 10 to 515p and Tesco 3 1/2
to 240p.
In a more perky food manufacturers sector, Booker rose 2 to 441p ahead of
results on Thursday. Cadbury Schweppes was steady at 479p and Northern Foods
added 3 to 275p. Both stocks have been left behind recently. Unilever, off
10 at 1203p, was upset by talk of an unofficial DTI inquiry into the ice
cream business.
Worries about the company's accountancy practices from several brokers
continued to exact a toll on engineering group Siebe. The shares fell
another 17 to 455p, with turnover reaching 1.3m. One broker however
suggested that the recent fall may have been overdone.
Negative press comment at TI Group saw the shares give up 7to 311p.
In motors, Pendragon shed 8 to 276p, after announcing an expected Pounds
16.6m rights issue. A recommendation from NatWest Securities however lifted
Perry Group 6 higher at 154p.
A cautious results statement from conglomerate Suter saw the shares give up
10 to 144p. Market watchers say Suter may soon launch a bid for engineering
group James Wilkes in which it raised its stake to more than 10 per cent
last week. Shares in Wilkes hardened 5 to 70p.
Among transport stocks, the collapse of talks between British Airways and
Virgin Atlantic led to weakness in the British flag carrier. The shares fell
8 to 279p.
The profits warning issued by the company after the close of trading on the
market last Friday, saw Vibroplant shares plunge 223 1/2 to 42 1/2 p. Sharpe
&amp; Fisher, on the other hand, jumped 12 to 95p after the better than expected
preliminary figures.

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI was buoyed by talk of disposals, with analysts believing that the
music and rental group is currently in discussions with several companies
about various aspects of its non-core business. Top of the sell list is the
company's defence business, with GEC said to be keen. Other Thorn divisions
being touted around for sale are said to include its security arm, the
lighting business and its HMV record stores. This would leave Thorn to
concentrate on its rental and music businesses, with some suggestions of a
demeger further down the line. Thorn shares held steady at 872p. GEC fell 5
to 300p.

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leisure and hotel group Rank Organisation was upset by the interpretation by
some analysts of tax changes announced at the Budget. NatWest Securities was
one house taking the view that the capital losses that Rank had bought with
the purchase of Mecca in 1990, amounting to between Pounds 400-500m, might
not be allowed to be offset against taxable gains on potential disposals of
the stake in Rank Xerox.
The sale of Rank's 50 per cent holding in Xerox has long been mooted as a
way of freeing resources for the group to focus on its core activities. A
figure in excess of Pounds 1bn from such a sale has been suggested by
analysts. Yesterday, NatWest used the tax argument to reiterate its negative
stance on Rank. The shares tumbled 16 to 653p, although turnover was only a
moderate 447,000.

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, weakened in recent weeks by the resignation of its chief executive
and deputy chairman and official criticism by US drug authorities of the
company's claims for Zantac, its anti-ulcer drug, came under renewed
pressure after press suggestions that Zantac could cause allergic reactions.
The shares fell to the lowest levels since June 1991.
At worst the shares touched 591p before stabilising to settle a net 12 off
at 601p. Turnover was a hefty 5.6m shares.
Some UK pharmaceutical analysts, strong supporters of Glaxo over the past
year or so during which their US counterparts have adopted an increasingly
critical attitude to the shares, maintained that selling of Glaxo had been
overdone.
SmithKline Beecham, another of the big drug companies quoted on the UK
market, closed 12 1/2 lower at 424 1/2 p on turnover of 2.1m. ICI, suffering
from the general retreat by the London market, settled 15 off at 1,225p.

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ruling boosts Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS manufacturer Wellcome was one of only a handful of strong performers
in the Footsie-100 and the only stock to make progress among the big
international drug companies after the relevant US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) committee recommended approval of Wellcome's Lamictal
drug.
Lamictal is used as a complimentary preparation to existing epilepsy
treatment and the FDA's committee recommended approval on Saturday.
The approval news saw Wellcome shares marked higher and continue to gain
ground at the outset of trading. At best the shares touched 898p. They
closed a net 6 higher at 894p with turnover reaching an above-average 1.3m.
Dealers also said the market was looking for a good set of interim results
from Wellcome on Thursday. Leading pharmaceuticals analysts expect Wellcome
to achieve pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 320m, against last time's
Pounds 244m.

FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: UK equities upset by Russian fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON suffered in the general setback in European stock markets prompted
yesterday by the darkening political scene in Russia. Although sterling,
benefiting from weakness in the German mark, held steady, share prices fell
heavily across the range of a stock market still taking a generally negative
view of last week's UK Budget. However, selling by the big institutions was
not heavy, as was borne out by the day's Seaq volume figure of 529.1m
shares, down by about 36 per cent on Friday's total. Sentiment was further
bruised by poor UK non EC trade figures.
A poor start by the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index, which took
over leadership of the derivatives sector yesterday, sparked off the slide
in equities. The Footsie Index itself quickly abandoned the 2,900 mark and
fell 41 points to 2,858.7 at the day's low point. A modest rally took the
FT-SE to a closing level of 2,863.9, a net loss of 36.2 on the day.
Yesterday's loss of 1.2 per cent on the Footsie Index was close to the
average loss in European markets, with Germany providing the strongest
exception with a loss of just over 2 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
recorded only a minor fall, closing 10.7 off, or 0.3 per cent, at 3,144.
Non-Footsie business made up around 62 per cent of total Seaq business
yesterday. Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained high,
recording value of Pounds 1.54bn on Friday.
Steadiness in sterling, benefiting from weakness in the German currency, was
largely ignored in London where hopes for a further cut in base rates have
now been put aside for the present. Investors in the UK stock market now
appear to be pinning their faith in prospects for long-awaited recovery in
the domestic economy, rather than in prospects of a further cut in domestic
base rates.
However, the suddenness of the fall in UK equities alerted fears that the
market could be vulnerable down to FT-SE 2,800 in the wake of a UK Budget
now seen as threatening further fiscal tightening in the future as well as
concerns over dividend yields in the near term. However, some analysts
believe that the Budget measures on dividends on overseas earnings may not
unduly upset a stock market more likely to focus on prospects for strong
corporate earnings.
Underlying confidence was implied by the late rally in UK stocks which
contrasted with a fall of 16.75 on the Dow in early dealings on Wall Street.
Many sectors of the market gave back some of their recent gains. Food
retailers, hotels and selected engineering shares fell foul of
profit-takers. But merchant banks continued to respond favourably to
excellent company results from the big names of the sector.
Among the industrial blue chips, pharmaceutical stocks continued to suffer
from the nervousness prompted by both the new political regime in the US and
by market re-ratings of what had been one of its most-favoured sectors.
But losses in the blue chip issues were emphasised by general uncertainty
regarding the latest developments in Russsia as well as across other areas
of eastern Europe. The London market was following other Continental centres
in foreseeing pressures on Wall Street as global investors await the outcome
of the renewed struggle for power in the former Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
FADING hopes of a cut in UK base rates, worries about the political
situation in Russia and a higher than expected trade deficit combined to
depress the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,905, 5
points below Friday's close, was the first indication of the selling that
was to drive June lower for the rest of the session on the domestic economic
and overseas worries.
A mid-morning attempt at a rally petered out after the 11.30am release of
figures showing a higher than anticipated UK trade deficit with non-EC
countries. This drove June lower once again, falling to 2,861 by lunchtime.
Bargain hunting saw the contract start to claw its way back from the lows
after lunch, but the upward momentum once again proved to be premature for
the poor opening on Wall Street led to another bout of selling of the
contract.
June eventually closed at 2,852, down 58 on the previous session and around
an 11-point discount to the underlying cash market, with volume a healthy
12,927 lots.
Traded options was also dull and saw volume of 26,130 contracts, down from a
previous 30,610. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 7,385 contracts and
the Euro-FT-SE 3,058. Fisons was the busiest stock option after a 'Roll
Over' trade, at 3,020 lots.

Wall Street
CONCERN about political turmoil in Russia initially sent US share prices
spiralling downwards yesterday morning, but by midsession the market had
started to claw back from its lower levels, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped more than 27 points in
morning trading, ended the day down a more moderate 8.10 at 3,463.48. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.30 at 448.88, while the
Amex composite was 3.19 lower at 419.18, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled
6.10 at 676.62. Trading volume on the NYSE was around 232m shares and
declines outnumbered rises by 1,205 to 660.
Drug company stocks started the week on a gloomy note, with Merck initially
slipping to a 52-week low before regaining lost ground to close down Dollars
 1/8 at Dollars 35 3/4 . Glaxo Holdings fell Dollars  1/4 to a 52-week low
of Dollars 17 3/4 but Abbott Laboratories ended the day Dollars  7/8 higher
at Dollars 24 3/4 .
Software company Cadence Design plummeted Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 in
very heavy trading following predictions that revenues and earnings for the
first quarter will fall substantially below market expectations. The stock
has not traded below Dollars 13 1/8 since before 1992.
Cadence blamed its disappointing outlook on a systems product strategy shift
which had resulted in customers delaying product purchasing decisions. Mr
Joe Costello, the chairman, said that 'although we see signs for improvement
in business conditions in the second quarter, we remain cautious due to the
significance of the current shortfall'.
Shares in IBM slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 1/2 after Merrill Lynch
reduced its 1993 earnings forecast to a range of 50 cents to Dollars 1 a
share from earlier estimates of Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.50.
Tenneco recovered from sharp morning losses to edge Dollars  3/8 lower at
Dollars 47 3/4 on news of a major restructuring including a pre-tax
restructuring charge of Dollars 920m and a planned sale of at least 23.5m
common shares.
In Nasdaq trading, declining technology shares drove the market lower
through the day. Sun Microsystems sank Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 1/8 , , Dell
Computer fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 . Intel lost Dollars 3/8 to
Dollars 113 in spite of announcing that it has started shipping its new
Pentium microprocessor. and Apple Computer was off Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
53 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO prices closed mixed in heavy trading. Based on preliminary figures,
the 300 composite index rose 6.75 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,583.74.
Declines led advances 337 to 325.
Volume fell to 50.01m shares from 62.93m shares and trading value was
CDollars 388.3m compared with CDollars 589.4m.
Hudson's Bay Co. said a subsidiary has agreed to merge with Woodward's.
Hudson's Bay will own all of the merged company's outstanding equity.
Hudson's Bay fell  3/8 to 32 1/4 and Woodward's gained 0.105 to 0.33.

FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Tension in Moscow unnerves the
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a month's heightened political uncertainty in Russia took
European equities from last week's effective stasis into a clear decline,
writes Our Markets Staff.
A week ago, Goldman Sachs said that global equities could lose 2-3 per cent
on continuing political instability in Russia but that German equities were
likely to be affected most.
On the day, among senior bourses, this turned out to be the case. The Milan
bourse fell by more than 3 per cent against the 2.2 per cent drop in
Frankfurt but Italy seemed mesmerised by its own political problems.
FRANKFURT's DAX index fell 37.41 to 1,661.40. Goldman Sachs said last week
that the German market could 'justifiably' fall by 5 to 6 per cent over a
period, indicating that the 1,600 level is under threat.
Mr Mushtaq Shah, a strategist for the brokers, said that Goldman had also
thought that the German market was overvalued, and that the Russian problems
could act as a trigger for a correction in the market.
Turnover fell from DM20.5bn, inflated by Friday's options expiry, to
DM6.8bn. Weakness in derivatives spilled over into the cash market and
affected Allianz, the insurer, subject of a recent attempt to manipulate the
options market; Allianz ended DM67, or 2.9 per cent lower at DM2,242.
Some construction stocks, and financials were hit harder than most. Hochtief
and Holzmann fell by DM43 to DM1,135 and DM47 to DM1,037 on the thought that
Mr Yeltsin's problems could threaten contracts to build flats for Russian
soldiers returning home from east Germany.
Among banks the main fallers were Bayernhypo, Commerzbank and Dresdner, down
DM15.90 to DM438, DM10.50 to DM289.50 and DM16 to DM405 respectively.
Brokers said that the Bavarian bank was hurt at the outset by misreporting
of its results - it recovered a token DM2.50 to DM440.50 in London later -
while the other two, like some of the builders, had been popular with
investors recently.
MILAN tracked the mood of other markets but had domestic worries of its own
which acted as an additional depressant. The Comit index reacted with a fall
of 15.09 or 3 per cent to 481.57 but turnover was reported to have been low
as many international investors remained absent.
The already beleaguered government suffered a further setback with the
resignation of the agriculture minister, the sixth cabinet member to have
quit in connection with investigations into widespread corruption and
bribery. However, some consolation was found in suggestions that March
inflation data would show a decline over the previous month.
Nevertheless, many investors were dismayed by further delays in the
privatisation programme in spite of comments by Mr Piero Barucci, the
treasury minister, that the government was committed to forcing through the
proposals. He added that the cabinet hoped to be able to approve a plan for
the flotation of ENI units by the end of the month.
The market was unimpressed by news late in the session of terms for
Montedison's sale of its majority stake in its pharmaceuticals subsidiaries
to Procordia of Sweden. The shares fixed L59 lower at L1,240. Fiat, up
sharply on Friday on reports that Renault might take a stake in the group,
eased L197 to L5,400.
PARIS had already factored in a victory for the right wing in Sunday's first
round of the elections, so it looked further afield for stimulation. The
CAC-40 index lost 23.4 to 1,939.28, but ended off the day's low of 1,927 as
turnover slipped to FFr2.2bn.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe in London said that the new government
would aim to raise some FFr50-60m a year through privatisations, with Elf
Aquitaine, Rhone Poulenc and Renault among the favoured early candidates:
'Prospects for the latter would be damaged by the widely rumoured
acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in Fiat, a move denied by both companies
but widely believed by industry sources.'
Suez eased FFr4.70 to FFr309.60 on worries over the suspension of Baltica
Holdings, the Danish insurer, in which it has a stake.
STOCKHOLM followed the mood of the day with a fall in the Affarsvarlden
general index of 24.00, or 2.5 per cent to 983.2. Turnover was low at
SKr569m.
Handelsbanken, however, went against the trend with gain of SKr0.50 to
SKr71.00 assisted by the prospect of easier European interest rates.
VIENNA reacted to Russia's weekend showdown, and Austria's physical
proximity to eastern Europe, with a fall of 4 per cent, the ATX index
closing 33.09 lower at 783.86. ZURICH was lifted off the day's low by news
that the Union Bank of Switzerland plans to cut its mortgage rates by half a
percentage point on June 1. The SMI index fell by a below average 21.0 to
2,161.6.
COPENHAGEN was depressed further by worries over Baltica Holding, the
insurer, which announced restructuring proposals. The KFX index shed 1.96 or
2.4 per cent to 78.87 with Baltica down DKr55 at DKr100. Its main
shareholder, Den Danske Bank, was off DKr10 at DKr305.

FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei boosted by
reports of larger fiscal package
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO was firmer on reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is
considering an economic fiscal package of some Y14,000bn, boosting hopes of
an early economic recovery, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 247.22 at 18,784.39, the day's high, having
opened at the day's low of 18,559.85 before rallying throughout the day on
buying by foreign investors.
Volume fell to 300m shares from 630m, due to subdued activity by dealers who
are reluctant to build up positions before the March 31 financial year end.
Gains led losses by 626 to 386, with 162 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks rose 7.01 to 1,413.70 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index 2.52 to 1,126.48.
Investors were also encouraged by a rise in last month's money supply: M2
plus certificates of deposits, the country's money supply aggregate, rose
0.2 per cent from the previous year, its first rise in six months. Traders
said that lower interest rates had pushed more liquidity into the economy,
including financial markets.
Reports over the weekend that the new fiscal support package would be far
larger than the Y10,700bn package formulated last August also added to the
optimism.
Steels and shipbuilders were stronger with Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, rising Y3 to Y340, followed by Kawasaki Steel, which gained Y8
to Y323. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the leading shipbuilder, advanced Y11
to Y548.
Sankyo, a leading pharmaceutical company, lost Y50 to Y2,360 on reports of
alleged side effects of one of its products. Other drug makers were firm,
with Takeda Chemical rising Y10 to Y1,350 and Dai-Ichi Pharmaceutical up Y50
to Y1,540.
Construction companies, which were raided by tax officials over the weekend
on alleged links with Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former kingpin of the LDP, lost
ground. Nishimatsu Construction fell Y30 to Y1,150 and Tobishima retreated
Y12 to Y539.
Brokers, which rose last week on hopes that the recent market rally would
help earnings, fell on profit-taking with Nomura Securities losing Y40 to
Y1,850 and Daiwa Securities down Y20 to Y1,080.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 106.24 to 19,562.82 in volume of 61.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE political turmoil in Russia weighed on some of the region's markets
yesterday.
TAIWAN closed higher as financials regained Saturday's losses, the weighted
index closing up 100.70, or 2.2 per cent at 4,674.28. Turnover was TDollars
55.1bn.
Some brokers commented that the financial sector will face profit-taking in
the coming days although they expect support to remain for banks. Hua Nan
Bank put on TDollars 9.50 to TDollars 157.00.
BANGKOK was led down by banks and property groups with some observers
commenting that political worries, with rumours of an impending cabinet
reshuffle, may have led to the change in sentiment. The SET index lost 12.77
or 1.4 per cent to 899.23 in turnover of Bt3.2bn. Declines led advances by
205 to 34 with 53 stocks unchanged.
HONG KONG fell back in the absence of further developments in the dispute
between Britain and China over the future of the democratic process. The
Hang Seng index closed 28.30 lower at 6,060.04 in turnover of HKDollars
2.25bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 3.88bn.
Jardine Matheson slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 47.00 while its affiliate,
Hong Kong Land, which was due to announce its final results after the close,
lost 10 cents to HKDollars 13.00.
AUSTRALIA lost ground throughout the day; investors were upset by
developments in Russia. The All Ordinaries index dipped 12.9 to 1,664.3 in
turnover of ADollars 226.8m.
Great Central Mines was lifted by ADollars 3 to ADollars 11 on reports of
increasing US support for the company's West Australian diamond operations.
Foster's Brewing dropped 4 cents to ADollars 1.19 on continuing speculation
that Asahi Breweries intends to sell part of its 17 per cent stake.
SEOUL eased for the first time in four trading sessions, on profit-taking.
The composite index shed 10.00 to 658.75 in turnover of Won330.3bn.
SINGAPORE also suffered profit-taking following a recently strong
performance. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 12.52 to 1,652.26.
Carnaud, which last week reported healthy profits on lower turnover, rose 60
cents to SDollars 10.40 in volume of 25,000 shares.
MANILA rose slightly on speculation that Manila Electric will declare a
dividend some 40 to 60 per cent higher than last year. The composite index
rose 1.88 to 1,455.60 in combined turnover of 522.6m pesos.
NEW ZEALAND weakened as a number of major companies went ex dividend.
The NZSE-40 index fell 22.68 to 1,567.59 in turnover of NZDollars 25m.

FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Two-way market in Tokyo outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, Japan dominated the FT-Actuaries World Indices last week, taking
the World Index to a gain of 1.1 per cent in local currency terms in spite
of flat performances from the US, and Europe.
Declining corporate profits, low economic growth, and political scandals
have put the health of the recent Tokyo rally in question. It has been
suggested that the gains, owing much to the performance of NTT, the partly
state-owned telecommunications stock, have been engineered to get Japan's
financial institutions comfortably through the closing of their books on
March 31.
However, Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist who called the turn of
the Tokyo market last year, thinks that the market is more strongly based
than that.
He says that institutions are turning their attention to next year and that,
after a drop in domestic interest rates, equities are much more attractive.
Investors are beginning to expect a massive reflation of the Japanese
economy, with a fiscal package of Y14,000bn now on the cards.
Mr Knight says that there is growing evidence that the bad corporate news
has been priced into the market, and that institutions are beginning to look
beyond that to prospective recovery. The Japanese, now, are much more
receptive to talk of corporate restructuring than they used to be; and,
finally, foreigners are losing their conviction that big short positions in
Tokyo equities will pay off from next April onwards.
Ireland put up the biggest gain of the week and, indeed, of the year so far.
Dealers at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin say that the country's inclusion from
May 1 in Morgan Stanley's world index series has helped; talk of an outside
buyer in the Greencore privatisation has moved on to Irish Life; and the
steady reduction in domestic interest rates continued with another cut last
Friday.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yeltsin weakens the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK had a weaker tone against the dollar and European currencies
yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of direct rule raised
deep concern about political stability in Russia, writes James Blitz.
Political tension in the former Soviet Union tends to have a negative impact
on the German currency. Germany is perceived to have a high level of foreign
investment in Russia, while the physical proximity of both countries raises
concerns that Bonn might one day face an even worse refugee crisis than the
current one.
Consequently, the D-Mark lost some of the ground it had made against the
dollar at the end of last week. After closing at DM1.6330 on Friday night,
the dollar rose as high as DM1.6473 in Europe yesterday morning. However,
the US currency was unable to sustain the rise, and fell back to close at
DM1.6375, up nearly  1/2 a pfennig on the day.
Several factors limited the dollar's upside yesterday.
First, there was speculation in currency markets that the Bundesbank would
today ease its repo rate - the interest rate at which it offers short term
funds to commercial banks. The level of German call money - at 8.65 per cent
 -remains well above the new Discount rate of 7.50 per cent, and the
Bundesbank may want money market rates to come into line. However, instead
of cutting the repo rate today, it may choose to inject a large amount of
liquidity into the banking system.
Secondly, the dollar was capped by expectations that the next batch of US
economic indicators will be on the weak side. Mr Christian Dunis, an
economist at Chemical Bank in London, expects tomorrow's Durable Goods
Orders for February to be poor.
Finally, there is no reason to think that the dollar should make long-term
gains from a Russian crisis. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman
Brothers in London, said he found it hard to recall the last time the dollar
enjoyed a sustained rise from an east European crisis. 'If anybody will lose
his peace dividend from this crisis it is President Clinton, not Chancellor
Kohl,' he said.
Last week's tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism were offset by
the Russian crisis. Having fallen as low as FFr3.4150 on Friday, the French
franc closed at FFr3.400 last night. However, sterling - which is outside
the system - failed to make the same headway because of a poor set of UK
trade figures. The pound closed up 1/2 a pfennig at DM2.4375.
The excellent performance by right wing parties and the National Front in
the French elections might have worsened the franc's plight had it not been
for the crisis in Moscow. Dealers have been suspicious that a new French
administration might be less tied to President Mitterrand's European policy.
Markets may exert more pressure once a new administration is in place.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures contracts fell again yesterday as dealers continued to
assume that UK base rates would not fall below 6 per cent in the medium
term, writes James Blitz.
The sterling market was again swayed by indications that UK monetary policy
would remain tight for the forseeable future.
In last Tuesday's budget, the UK chancellor said the prospects for economic
growth were consistent with the current level of base rates. An unexpected
drop in the number of people out of work also consolidated the view that the
economy did not need to be stimulated by an easing of policy.
In addition, yesterday's trade figures, which showed the UK's visible
deficit with non-EC countries widening to Pounds 1.3bn in February, may also
have raised concerns about the vulnerability of the pound if base rates are
cut again.
The June short sterling contract fell 10 basis points to close at 94.12, and
the September contract fell 13 basis points to close at 94.26. Both these
prices effectively assumed that base rates will remain unchanged for the
next 6 months.
The fall in the June contract by some 44 basis points since last Tuesday
underlined the speed with which assumptions about base rates had been
revised.
One dealer said the June contract was a good buy from here, because it would
easily rise if there is any bad news on the economic front. Cash rates in
the sterling money market were more or less unchanged, with 3-month money
again closing at 6 1/16 per cent.
Euromark futures continued to reflect disappointment that the Bundesbank's
Lombard rate had not been cut at last Thursday's council meeting. However,
there were hopes that the repo rate - at which the Bundesbank provides
weekly funds to commercial banks - might be cut from 8.25 per cent today.
The June Euromark contract fell 7 basis points to close at 93.08. At this
level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 6.92 per cent, some 89 points
below yesterday's closing level.
However, according to one dealer, the chances of a cut in the repo rate
today are slim. He believed the Bundesbank would prefer to bring call money
down from the relatively high level of 8.65 per cent by adding emergency
funds. before touching the repo rate.

SUGAR futures slipped below Friday's closing levels as profit-taking in
London New York ate into gains. In early trading prices had continued last
week's uptrend, taking New York prices to fresh three-year peaks and
London's to the highest level since April 1991. London's May position, which
had reached Dollars 309.50 a tonne at one point, slipped back to Dollars 304
a tonne, down 80 cents. Traders had been expecting a price correction after
the recent sustained rise. 'It is healthier to have the market a little
lower, where it will attract fresh buying,' one commented. London robusta
COFFEE futures firmed in light trading with May closing at Dollars 891 a
tonne, up Dollars 11, just below the day's high. The initially steadier tone
on New York helped the London market to build on its morning advance, but
traders thought the price was unlikely in the near future to move back above
the Dollars 900 support level that was breached last week. LME COPPER prices
capitalised on the generally firmer trend engendered by the situation in
Russia but the cash price baulked at overhead resistance before closing
Pounds 4.50 up at Pounds 1,464 a tonne.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S AGRICULTURE ministry has announced a Esc220bn (Pounds 975m)
investment plan to promote and improve Portuguese food products to enable
farmers to compete with their European Community partners, reports Reuter
from Lisbon. The five-year programme includes Esc126bn of direct investment
by the government.
Portuguese farmers, hit by the worst drought this century, have protested at
what they say are cheap imports.
The plan includes a risk capital fund to help existing and new companies and
the creation of credit lines at discount interest rates for producers of
fruit and vegetables, rice and meat.
Other planned measures are a Esc5bn fund for agricultural and food products
promotion and investment in processing and distribution companies. The
promotion and quality control of food products will be subsidised and new
legislation will be introduced on the management of farm co-operatives.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market retreats after
pact talks failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COCOA prices were in retreat yesterday following the virtual
abandonment on Friday of the International Cocoa Organisation's attempt to
formulate a new international agreement with economic clauses.
The May contract shed Pounds 15 to close at Pounds 682 a tonne.
The ICCO earlier this month failed at the fourth attempt to bridge the gap
between producers and consumers at talks under the auspices of the United
Nations in Geneva. Delegates to last week's council meeting at the ICCO
headquarters in London were hoping to make enough progress to return to
Geneva later this year.
The ICCO agreement has operated without market support measures since early
1988, when its buffer stock system collapsed. The agreement runs out in
September, threatening the possible sale of more than 230,000 tonnes of
cocoa on to a weak market.
Delegates will meet again for a special ICCO session in London from June 8
to 11. They will discuss a proposal from Mr Matthew Nwagwu, chairman of the
ICCO Council, for 'a limited form of economic agreement which would discard
temporarily the problem issues such as price range for withholding purposes,
withholding scheme and financing of the withholding scheme'.
The latest proposal envisages controlled liquidation of the buffer stock,
and a production and consumption policy.
Analysts now believe there is little chance of the withholding scheme, which
was planned to keep 350,000 tonnes off the market, ever coming into force,
although the proposal allows for its revival at a future date.
Basically, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures
brokers, ICCO members will be trying to prevent the liquidation of the
buffer stock.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: No punches pulled as Mrs Witte
goes for gold - A bitter battle to reduce costs at Canada's Giant mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YELLOWKNIFE, capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, is a rough place at
the best of times. But the mood there has turned downright ugly in the ten
months since 240 workers were locked out from the Giant gold mine on the
outskirts of town.
Middle ground has become hard to find in the bitter dispute between Royal
Oak Mines, which owns Giant, and the local branch of the Canadian
Association of Steel and Allied Workers (Casaw). Brawls erupt more
frequently than ever in Yellowknife's numerous bars and vandalism has become
endemic. The mood among the town's 15,000 residents was captured in a
recently-circulated anonymous letter, which expressed the wish that every
member of the union would be 'dropped from a helicopter in the middle of
Great Slave Lake with a ball and chain on each wrist and ankle'.
Emotions were rubbed especially raw by the deaths of nine strike-breakers in
an underground explosion at the mine last September. Although no arrests
have yet been made, many residents of Yellowknife take it for granted that
Casaw members were involved.
Only the intensity of the Giant dispute, however, separates it from tensions
which are evident throughout North American resource industries as employers
and workers wrestle with sagging metal prices and competition from low-cost
Third World suppliers.
Mrs Peggy Witte, Royal Oak's president, sees her company as one of the few
willing to confront organised labour in the drive to bring down costs.
Throughout the Giant dispute, Royal Oak has single-mindedly concentrated on
keeping the mine in operation, rather than taking the less painful routes of
cutting production or watering down its demands for concessions from the
union.
Third-quarter output of 22,185 ounces was 5 per cent lower than the same
quarter a year earlier, but 7 per cent up on the previous three months.
Giant's fourth-quarter production was not disclosed in Royal Oak's 1992
results, published last week.
'Many of the big companies don't want to face the situation,' Mrs Witte
says. She adds, however, that several of them have demonstrated their
support by contributing to the reward fund - now totalling CDollars 225,000
(Pounds 120,000) - for information leading to the arrest of the those
responsible for last September's murders.
Mrs Witte asserts that 'nobody is aggressive enough to say: 'It's got to
stop here'. I'm not willing to keep the mine open with a (labour) contract I
can't live with'.
Royal Oak has kept Giant operating with replacement workers flown in from
the south and, more recently, with some Casaw members who have crossed the
picket line. The company has rejected government efforts to impose a
settlement on anything other than its own terms. Mrs Witte also refuses
point-blank to take any union activists back on the payroll until last
September's murders are solved.
Royal Oak's uncompromising stand has won it admirers, but also many enemies.
A government commission was in Yellowknife last week to hear allegations
that a new union formed by replacement workers and strike-breakers is, in
the words of Casaw's lawyer, a 'front organisation' for the company.
'She doesn't want to sit down and talk to us,' complains a worker manning
the union's picket hut outside Giant's main gate. The hut is plastered with
slogans such as 'Scabs took our jobs'. Although Mrs Witte denies it, Casaw
and its sympathisers are convinced that Royal Oak's aim is to destroy the
union.
For Royal Oak, the nub of the issue is the survival of the mine. According
to Mrs Witte, Giant has a life of at least 10 years if costs can be brought
down to the USDollars 280-290 an ounce range, which is substantially below
the present gold price of Dollars 330 an ounce. If not, the mine is unlikely
to last longer than another two or three years without a big jump in the
bullion price.
Wage increases at Giant have averaged 8.3 per cent a year since the early
1980s. Prior to the lockout, workers were taking home an average of CDollars
77,000 a year in pay and benefits, with the best-paid earning CDollars
132,000, equivalent in Canada to a senior manager's salary at a large
company.
During negotiations with the union last year, Royal Oak offered to maintain
hourly wage rates. But it wants to peg future increases to the gold price
and to trim benefits, including a number of holidays, regular air fares to
Edmonton, 950 km (590 miles) to the south, and the bus which carries miners
between Yellowknife and the mine.
Since it bought the mine in 1990, Royal Oak has succeeded in bringing down
cash production costs from almost Dollars 400 an ounce to about Dollars 305
an ounce. (The latest figures exclude CDollars 3.5m in strike-related costs
last year, almost all spent on extra security for the property and the
replacement workers).
Royal Oak has added an extra shift, changed work schedules and put greater
emphasis on preventive maintenance. The replacement workers have accepted
substantially lower wages than the locked-out union members.
Giant's survival is crucial to Royal Oak's plans to press ahead with
expansion plans in the Northwest Territories. The company, which is carving
out a reputation for restoring high-cost gold mines to profitability, last
month signed a deal to acquire the mothballed Colomac property, north-east
of Yellowknife.
It aims to reopen Colomac in 1994, bringing down operating costs from about
Dollars 425 an ounce when the mine was closed to less than Dollars 300. The
key to lower costs however, is running Colomac in tandem with the Giant
property. Payroll, human resources, safety administration and various other
functions would be combined.
Mrs Witte is also interested in buying Kennecott's Con mine in Yellowknife
'if the price was right.' The labour contract at Con, which expires at the
end of April, is currently being renegotiated.
The mine's owners and its workers are expected to draw some sobering lessons
from recent events at Giant. Observers in Yellowknife anticipate that the
United Steelworkers Union, which represents the Con workers, will accept
management's demands for concessions more readily than its counterpart did
at Giant. Indeed, Mrs Witte predicts that the tough line she is taking at
Giant will find an echo in the North American mining industry far beyond
Yellowknife's two gold producers.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tokyo court hears more evidence
on seized coins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Japanese authorities prepare to issue a gold coin to mark the
forthcoming wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito, there was a reminder yesterday
of the embarrassing fiasco that followed the Hirohito coin issue in 1986.
Lawyers for Mr Paul Davies, a UK coin dealer, were back in court in Tokyo
claiming compensation of Y320m (USDollars 2.7m), plus interest, from the
Japanese government and the Tokyo Metropolitan government for 3,200 Hirohito
coins which he claims were illegally confiscated by Tokyo police in February
1990.
At that time the police claimed the coins were forgeries and said they had
uncovered Japan's largest known counterfeiting case. They alleged that the
coins were part of a consignment of 107,000, then worth USDollars 70m,
suspected of being counterfeits and imported to Japan from the Middle East
through European intermediaries.
Mr Davies, a 41-year-old barrister who set up a coin dealing business in
Ilkley, West Yorkshire, 20 years ago, has always protested his coins were
genuine. No charges have ever been brought against him even though he has
frequently been back to Japan to fight his case. He suggests the Tokyo
police effectively abandoned their investigations in the summer of 1990.
Since he began his civil action a year ago there have been six court
hearings at which written evidence has been presented. At yesterday's
hearing evidence presented by Mr Ernest Newman, former chief metallurgist at
the UK Royal Mint, was critical of a report previously submitted by the
finance ministry's Osaka Mint. Once again Mr Newman insisted that the
confiscated coins were genuine.
The Finance Ministry made a huge profit on the Hirohito coins because they
were priced at Y100,000 each (Pounds 580 at the present exchange rate),
twice the value then of the 30 grams of gold they contained. However, as the
coins were legal tender and the Bank of Japan was obliged to buy them back
at Y100,000 each, there were obvious risks that forgers might try to cash in
on the premium between the gold content and the legal-tender price.
Uncertainties about the Hirohito coins caused the Japanese authorities to
delay by several months the launch of gold coins to commemorate Emperor
Akihito's accession to the throne - more gold was put into the coins and the
number issued was substantially reduced to 2m compared with 10m Hirohitos.
The Finance Ministry says 2m gold coins will also be issued to mark the
Crown Prince's wedding but so far have given no other details.
Meanwhile, Mr Davies expects it will take many more months before the court
rules on his action.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: South African fruit industry
faces tough year after crop setbacks

THE SOUTH African deciduous fruit industry faces a tough year following
damage caused to the crop by extreme heat and hail. The total crop will
probably fall to 38m cartons - 5m below expectations - from 40m last year.
Prices are also under pressure in Europe, the industry's largest market,
owing to the twin effect of consumers trading down because of the recession
and the large surplus from last year's huge northern hemisphere crop. Mr
Louis Kriel, chief executive of Unifruco, the export marketing arm for
deciduous fruit, said northern hemisphere stocks were about 40 per cent
higher than during the previous season.
South Africa has about 33 per cent of the southern hemisphere deciduous
fruit market in Europe. After minerals and metals, deciduous fruit is its
largest export industry and has shown impressive growth in recent years.
Mr Kriel said a feature of the current season was that after 50 years of
being South Africa's largest customer the UK would probably be supplanted
this year by Germany. About 11m cartons are sold annually to each country.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian supply worries push
metals prices higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS ABOUT Russian political instability spilled over into the metals
markets yesterday. Prices of aluminium, gold, nickel and platinum all rose
sharply, reflecting the prominent role Russia plays as a supplier of these
metals.
Dealers pointed out that, if disruption in Russia became widespread, metal
shipments might be curtailed and this would be a welcome relief for western
world producers who have seen prices decimated in the past two years by huge
rises in Russian exports.
Nickel for delivery in three months at one point yesterday gained nearly 4
per cent from Friday's close on the London Metal Exchange to touch Dollars
6,245 a tonne. However, profit-taking emerged and nickel closed at Dollars
6,125, up Dollars 107.50 a tonne.
Three-month aluminium prices rose by nearly 2 per cent to Dollars 1,193 a
tonne, not only because of concerns about Russian politics but also on
reports of an explosion at the Bratsk smelter, the largest in the world. The
Reuter news agency later reported the impact on Bratsk's output was not as
serious as first feared and the LME aluminium price subsided to close at
Dollars 1,184.50 a tonne, up Dollars 12.75.
Russia is the world's second-largest producer of platinum, after South
Africa, and in London last night platinum prices closed Dollars 5.75 a troy
ounce, or 1.6 per cent, ahead at Dollars 356.
Earlier, Mr Nickolai Menjshikov, an official from Russia's platinum group
metals exporting agency, Almazshikov, on a visit to Tokyo told Reuter that
his country's shipments would be limited this year because of falling
demand. Analysts suggested that if cuts were made it would have more to do
with production problems than with Russia's willingness to support prices
with supply reductions.
Meanwhile, gold closed in London at its highest level in US dollar terms
this year - at Dollars 332.15 an ounce, up 70 cents. Dealers said there was
no selling by producers, who frequently take advantage of price rises to
hedge their output. One analyst suggested this probably reflected the fact
that the contango (premium for metal for future delivery) was a 'very lean'
Dollars 9 an ounce a year compared with nearly Dollars 40 at the peak.

FT  23 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Russian crisis casts shadow and causes
yields to rise
</HEADLINE>

THE deepening crisis in Russia cast a shadow over the European bond markets
yesterday, causing yields to rise across all the main markets.
The German bond market was most directly affected by unease over the
political uncertainty in Russia. Cash bunds fell back by around a quarter of
a point, while the June futures contract on Liffe was trading late in the
day at 95.38, down from 95.63 at the opening.
The bund market seemed mesmerised both by the events in Russia and by
anticipation of this week's repurchase agreement (or repo) auction. Since
last week's cut in the discount rate, the market has been looking for a cut
of as much as 25 basis points in the repo rate from its current 8.25 per
cent, with some optimists expecting even more. Anything less could leave the
market seriously questioning the pace at which German rates will fall during
this year, with adverse consequences for the bund market, warned Mr Kit
Juckes, international analyst at Warburg Securities.
FRENCH government bonds were also caught in the fall-out from Russia, but
the market gathered some confidence from the firmness of the franc after the
weekend's opening round of elections. The early election results merely
confirmed the market's expectations, and did little to ease concern that
pressure would grow on the French currency in coming weeks.
This week's German repo auction could provide an early test. 'If the
Bundesbank disappoints, and short rates stay above 11 per cent, the pressure
will grow to cut interest rates with the franc outside the ERM,' said Mr
Philip Tyson, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
THE UK bond market, meanwhile, lost ground ahead of today's announcement of
details of the latest government bond auction. The auction will be of 15-20
year paper, the part of the yield curve which has seen the strongest
performance in recent weeks.
As a result, longer-dated bonds suffered the biggest losses yesterday, as
they did had after the auction was announced on Friday.
The reversal in the market was compounded by poor February trade figures
with non-EC countries, which showed a sharp pick-up in imports.
The 9 per cent gilts due in 2008 lost three-quarters of a point during the
day, pushing the yield up to 8.21 per cent, from 8.15 per cent on Friday.
Shorter-dated paper also fell back, in part reflecting the fading hopes
since last week's Budget of a further cut in UK interest rates.
US TREASURY prices firmed slightly in fairly light late trading yesterday,
with shorter-dated maturities buoyed by reports of political instability in
Russia.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104
5/32 , yielding 6.795 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note firmed  3/32 , to yield 3.874 per cent.
Later this week, the market will have to digest new supply, when the
Treasury sells Dollars 15.25bn in two-year notes tomorrow and Dollars 11bn
in five-year notes on Thursday.
ITALY'S Association of Interbank dealers and Treasurers (ATIC) plans to
launch a contract to hedge domestic interbank deposits, Reuter reports. ATIC
hopes the contract could be up and running in September, with technical
specifications ready by June.
A three-month Eurolira bond contract already trades on the London
International Financial Futures Exchange.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Andean Fund plans Dollars 75m
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Andean Development Fund, awarded last week an investment-grade rating by
Standard &amp; Poor's, is planning a Eurodollar bond issue next month if market
conditions permit.
The BBB rating for the fund - known by its Spanish acronym CAF and owned by
the governments of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela - makes it
the second Latin borrower to achieve investment grade status. The other is
the government of Chile, which was awarded the same rating last year and is
unlikely to be an active borrower.
Mr Enrique Garcia, the fund's executive president, said a Dollars 75m
five-year issue - its first in the public bond markets - was planned next
month, with Chemical Bank as lead underwriter.
The fund wants to make further bond issues this year in other markets, such
as the Yankee bond market in the US and Japan's Samurai market.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan goes slow on commission
change
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN, the only leading stock market nation where brokers' charges are still
fixed, is about to take its first step towards the deregulation of trading
commissions.
An advisory committee is expected today to endorse a gradual liberalisation,
starting with transactions of more than Y1bn (Dollars 8.4m). The measures
are due to take effect from April next year.
Transactions in excess of Y1bn make up 5 per cent of all trades among the
big four securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and some 2
per cent for the top 10 second-tier brokers. The immediate impact of
deregulation is thus likely to be minimal.
The decision to go-slow on deregulation is seen as a victory for the
securities industry, since the changes will have little impact on
brokerages' returns. The brokers have argued that injecting competition into
commission rates would lead to higher small-lot rates and drive individual
and small-lot investors away from the stock market.
Fixed brokerage commissions took most of the blame for the spate of stock
scandals two years ago, when brokers were found to be underwriting the share
losses of favoured clients. Supporters of deregulated commissions argue that
price competition would have made this practice obsolete.
The securities industry was outraged when the ministry of finance agreed to
review fixed commissions, since the ministry had originally agreed with the
securities industry that commissions would remain fixed but lowered to
international standards. Deregulation of commissions would result in lower
profits for the brokers.
The advisory group will also recommend that the effects be carefully
monitored, implying that full liberalisation may take longer than many
critics of the system anticipated.
Supporters of liberalisation, including institutional investors and some
foreign houses, argue that fixed commissions help maintain Japan's brokerage
oligopoly. But the securities industry contends that lower costs for
institutional trading will result in lower costs for individuals.
Liberalisation will hurt smaller houses, which rely heavily on client
commissions; and an increase in large-lot transactions could mean greater
risks for the bigger brokerages.
The ministry of finance, the reluctant advocate of commission
liberalisation, says an agenda for further deregulation is not yet set, due
to the weakness of the stock market and heavy losses among smaller brokers.
Although stock market weakness has forced the ministry of finance to scale
down its plans for financial reform, an easing of the barriers between
banking and the securities industry, together with interest rate
deregulation, appears to remain an official priority.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Ontario Hydro raises CDollars 1.5bn
amid brisk new activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW issue activity in the international bond market was brisk and varied
yesterday, in spite of weakness in government bond markets across Europe.
Ontario Hydro raised CDollars 1.5bn through an issue of five-year global
bonds. The issuer had announced its intention to launch a global bond issue
last week. The Kingdom of Sweden is also said to be considering a five-year
Canadian dollar Eurobond issue.
Ontario Hydro's bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 1/4 per cent, were priced
to yield 73 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds, in the
middle of the indicated range of 72-74 basis points.
An official at Goldman Sachs, one of the four joint lead managers, said that
investor demand gauged in the run-up to yesterday's launch enabled the
underwriting group to pitch the bonds slightly below an original target
spread in the mid-1970s.
The bonds were distributed mainly in Europe and Canada, but interest from
eastern Asia was thin, mainly because of the ending of the Japanese
financial year. When the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread was
virtually unchanged.
The day's other big issue was a Dollars 1bn seven-year warrant Eurobond
issue from Roche Holdings Inc, the US financing arm of the big Swiss drugs
company. The proceeds of the bonds, which carry a coupon of 2 3/4 per cent,
will be used to re-finance Roche's loans related to the Dollars 2.1bn
purchase in 1990 of a 60 per cent stake in Genentech, the Californian
biotechnology company.
The issue, led by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), has a novel structure
whereby holders of the warrants, which are exercisable into Roche
Genussscheine (non-voting profit-sharing certificates), have conditional
protection against a fall in the value of the Genussscheine.
However, this protection is eliminated if the shares rise to a so-called
'knock-out' price. The potential gains for investors are also capped.
The issue got a mixed reception. One syndicate manager involved in the deal
called the structure 'unnecessarily complicated'. Others said that the
structure puzzled investors and that the main beneficiary was the issuer
itself, since it was able to raise a large amount of money at a a relatively
low cost.
An official at SBC said that the issue had got off to a good start, with
demand for the package mainly from Switzerland. UK accounts showed some
interest for the stripped bonds. SBC quoted the bonds at 100 1/2 bid in the
late afternoon, but there was little actual trading. Some dealers said the
lack of activity suggested that the rest of the market was unable to put a
value on the bonds.
Elsewhere, Abbey National took advantage of investor demand for short-dated
dollar-denominated paper and raised Dollars 250m via a three-year Eurobond
issue. The bonds were priced to yield 38 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries, which offered a 10 basis point pick-up over the three-year
Dollars 250m issue launched last week by Landesbank Schleswig Holstein
Girozentrale.
Weakness in the German government bond market hampered the launch of
Metallgesellschaft Finance's DM300m seven-year Eurobond issue, though an
official at the joint lead manager, Deutsche Bank, said that sales had gone
well in view of the unfavourable market circumstances. The bonds were priced
to yield 70 basis points over comparable Bunds and were not freed to trade
by the close of business.
The European Investment Bank braved the Eurolira market, raising L300bn
through a five-year issue. The bonds, which were priced to yield 50 basis
points below comparable Italian government bonds, were mainly bought by
foreign investors wanting lira paper not issued by the Italian state, an
official at the lead manager Credito Italiano said.
The stream of Eurosterling issues continued as Eksportfinans, the Norwegian
export financing agency, launched a Pounds 100m five-year issue. The bonds
were priced to yield 43 basis points over comparable gilts and were not
freed to trade by late yesterday.

FORD Motor Company has agreed to set up a Dollars 90m joint venture with
Shanghai's Yafeng Accessories Factory to produce plastic car parts for
China's fast-growing automotive industry.
Ford is contributing half the investment for the plant, which will be built
in Pudong, Shanghai's new development zone on the east bank of the city's
Huangpu river. China has more than 4,000 auto parts plants, mostly
inefficient and resource-consuming.
'The joint project is still at its preliminary stage,' said Mr John Emmert
of Ford's Beijing office, 'but this market certainly looks encouraging.'
Ford's investment in Shanghai reflects intense and growing interest among
foreign carmakers in the China market.
Last year, China's car output reached a record 1.8m vehicles - roughly the
monthly output of General Motors. China aims to produce 3m vehicles a year,
65 per cent of which would be sedan cars, Mr Cai Shiqing, general manager of
China National Automotive Industry Corporation, was quoted as saying this
week by the official New China News Agency.
Mr Li Peng, China's premier, listed car manufacture as one of the four
pillar industries in his report to the National People's Congress, or
parliament.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: KIO's top Briton resigns as
treasurer
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, Kuwait's foreign investment arm, is losing its
most senior British manager, Mr Ian Black, who has resigned as the KIO's
treasurer and is to leave in June.
Mr Black has been a key figure in retaining the trust and confidence of the
international banking community in the KIO since the Iraqis were ejected
from Kuwait in early 1991.
He played a leading role in organising a Dollars 5.5bn loan to help
reconstruct the emirate after the Gulf war. He is also said to have helped
calm nervous bankers in recent months after a public investigation was
launched by the KIO's new management into alleged losses and fraud in
investments made by their predecessors in Spain.
The uproar surrounding this investigation, in which the KIO has refused to
honour some debts incurred by former managers, has worried some large
international banks.
Mr Black's departure is likely to coincide with a reduction in the power of
the KIO, headquartered in London. The Kuwaiti government is poised to
approve plans to merge the KIO into its younger Kuwait-based parent, the
Kuwait Investment Agency (KIA).
According to proposals by the Kuwaiti finance ministry, the new merged body
would be headed by Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, the new president of the KIO.
The merger would mean concentrating most decision-making power over Kuwaiti
investments back in Kuwait, a move some critics fear would open Kuwait's
finances to much greater political intervention.
Defenders of the plan say the KIA and the KIO already duplicate many of each
other's functions. If the merger does take place, a number of non-Kuwaiti
staff at the KIO in London are expected to be made redundant.

HOLDERBANK, the leading Swiss international cement group, reports net income
in 1992 up 49 per cent to SFr376m (Dollars 247m) on sales up 18 per cent to
SFr7.8bn, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Full details will be provided on May 4. Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman,
said in November that Latin American subsidiaries were performing very
strongly. Losses in the US, which had caused a 12.5 per cent slide in group
profits in 1991, were expected to remain high in 1992.
*****
Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, suffered a sharp fall in net
profits to FFr130m (Dollars 23.4m) in 1992 from FFr233m in 1991, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The group was hit by the sluggish state of the global luxury goods market
and a FFr40m loss on the launch of a new skin care range.
This may aggravate the political row over its FFr3.6bn acquisition earlier
this year by Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled
oil group.
YSL turnover slipped to FFr3.0bn from FFr3.01bn in 1991 but operating
profits declined to FFr379m from FFr512m over the same period. The group was
also affected by the impact of the rationalisation of its licensing
interests and of its perfume business, where it reduced sales to certain
countries to counter the threat of the grey market, or discount sector.
*****
Asarco, a leading US integrated copper producer, said it would report a loss
in the first quarter as a result of depressed metals prices and problems
with flooding at one of its Arizona mines, writes Laurie Morse from Chicago.
The company estimated that the effect of heavy rains and flooding would cost
about Dollars 20m after taxes. Asarco will report those charges in the first
quarter.
Asarco's Ray mine has been plagued by above-normal rainfall since mid-1992,
reducing copper production by 10,000 tonnes in the first quarter.
Metals refining processes in areas near the mine were also adversely
affected.

AKBANK, Turkey's leading retail bank, which is 87 per cent owned by the

Akbank, which floated 5 per cent of its capital on the Istanbul stock
exchange in 1990, is one of Turkey's most conservative banks. But tax
incentives for holders of Treasury bills and other government paper have
been scrapped, forcing banks to reconsider asset strategy. Akbank's 1992 tax
bill rose 140 per cent.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese trading house bails out
finance offshoot

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Corporation, the leading trading house, is reviewing its policy
of zaiteku, the financial engineering popular among Japanese companies,
after announcing the rescue of a subsidiary, M. C. Finance, which
accumulated stock investment losses of Y28bn (Dollars 237m).
During the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s, Mitsubishi and other
conservative industrial companies came to regard stock investment as an
important 'profit centre'. But the sometimes huge losses suffered by special
investment trusts have forced a reassessment of the risks of the stock
market.
MC was established in 1986 to act as a banker for Mitsubishi subsidiaries
and affiliates, borrowing large sums at discount rates from Japanese banks
and passing on the savings to these smaller companies, which would have paid
higher rates if they had negotiated their own bank loans.
The company was also encouraged by Mitsubishi executives to generate income
through stock investment, which seemed a safe bet in the late 1980s, when
Tokyo stock prices appeared capable of defying gravity. Like many other
companies, MC used tokkin, or specified money trusts, giving it control over
the choice of stocks.
But three years of falling stock prices have badly bruised MC and
Mitsubishi, which estimates that it, too, had Y310bn in tokkin funds at the
end of September, with Y80bn in unrealised losses. MC has about Y70bn in
funds invested in stocks, showing a loss of Y28bn.
As MC has capital of only Y2.5bn, and was unable to cope with the losses,
the parent company was forced to take action before the close this month of
the fiscal year. Mitsubishi said MC would 'concentrate on core activities of
providing financing, accounting and related services' to subsidiaries and
affiliates.
The trading house plans to cover the losses at MC through sales of its own
equity portfolio, which had unrealised gains on total stocks held of Y782bn
at the end of March last year. After covering the losses, the trading house
plans to reduce holdings of 'investment stocks', though it will maintain
strategic cross-shareholdings in Mitsubishi group companies.
Japanese trading houses have generally done poorly in their stock fund
investments. Sumitomo reported unrealised losses of Y60bn at the end of
September, Marubeni Y98bn, and Itochu Y92bn, prompting each of these
companies to review their stock investment policies.

Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said 1992 net
income tumbled 74 per cent to SFr11m (Dollars 7.1m), mainly because of heavy
restructuring costs.
The dividend, reduced from SFr10 to SFr8 in 1991, will be eliminated 'in
view of the significant deterioration in profitability and the uncertain
economic outlook.'
*****
Incentive, the Swedish industrial group, saw earnings after financial items
rise 70 per cent last year to SKr371m (Dollars 50.8m) from SKr218m, despite
a fall in sales to SKr11.77bn from SKr13.77bn, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
If earnings from the group's big shareholdings in Asea, Electrolux and Esab
are included, profits rose to SKr1.28bn from SKr1.17bn. An unchanged
dividend of SKr6 per share is proposed.
The group said sales fell partly because of worse market conditions and
partly because of divestments. The recession also hit orders, which fell 20
per cent to SKr11.4bn from SKr14.2bn.
The improved result stemmed from rationalisation, more efficient use of
capital and share sales. There were better performances from the group's
construction and environment, power and camera operations, but the materials
handling, process and transportation units all posted weaker results.

FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sekyra steels himself for repeat
performance - Austrian Industries' chief has to start restructuring all over
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE danger of being good at something is that you become condemned to it for
life. That seems to be the predicament of Mr Michael Sekyra, chief executive
of Austrian Industries.
Mr Sekyra earned a big reputation in Austria in the late 1980s for his
success in rationalising the sprawling state- owned heavy industrial
conglomerate and focusing it on four businesses; steel, plant engineering,
aluminium and oil and petrochemicals. Dozens of plants were shut or sold,
and nearly 30,000 jobs were eliminated between 1986, when he took the helm,
and 1991.
But after a three-year interlude of profits, the group tumbled back into
heavy losses last year as recession and the emergence of eastern European
competitors undermined some of its key businesses.
Figures are not available yet, but the speculation in Vienna is that AI
suffered a loss of about Sch2.9bn (Dollars 252m) last year, compared with a
profit of Sch2.1bn in 1991.
So now Mr Sekyra has to start restructuring all over again. His new goal is
to compress the group to only two businesses, steel and engineering, with
less than half its 1991 turnover of Sch170bn by the end of the decade.
'When we started in 1986, our target was to be competitive in western Europe
and to be prepared for Austria joining the EC,' Mr Sekyra says. 'We have
reached that target, but in the meantime we have been hit by an earthquake.'
The end of communism in eastern Europe has been doubly tough for AI,
depriving the group of markets while bringing new competitors desperate to
earn hard currency. And it is poorly placed to fight back. 'We have high
labour costs, high environmental protection expenses and a high exchange
rate,' Mr Sekyra says, so he has to assess afresh 'what is the portfolio
that we can survive with'.
He is not optimistic about the group's chances in aluminium, and a huge loss
at its Austria Metall (AMAG) subsidiary last year was the main contributor
to the group's woes. AMAG's only Austrian smelter has been closed,
participations in overseas smelters are for sale and AI is looking for
partners for the fabricating operations.
The group's big oil and chemical arm, OMV, which also suffered losses last
year, has been sold back to OIAG, the main state holding company, pending
sales of equity stakes to strategic partners.
Several other minor holdings are up for sale, leaving steel and plant
engineering as the two remaining pillars.
At first glance, it is difficult to see how landlocked Austria can be a
competitive steelmaker. But Mr Sekyra points out that the Voest Alpine Stahl
works at Linz is close to the motor industries of south Germany, Italy and
the Czech Republic, the main consumers of high quality, flat-rolled steel.
Also, raw material costs have been helped by the development of an effective
way to use low-cost Ukrainian iron ore in its blast furnace. The result is
that VA Stahl is among the top three steelmakers in Europe on costs, a
position it hopes to keep by investing heavily in lean production
techniques.
By the end of the century, Mr Sekyra sees AI as a steel and engineering
group with the equivalent of DM10m (Dollars 6m) turnover (compared with
roughly DM24bn today) and a split between steel and engineering of 30/70,
compared with 60/40 today.
'Our idea is not to be among the biggest 50 companies in Europe, but to have
a good balance of activities and stable results and to be fully privatised,'
he says.
The group originally hoped to float shares on the Vienna bourse this year,
but this is now out of the question. 'We are now trying to find industrial
banking partners. Our first step would be to sell 20 per cent to 30 per cent
and then, after the recession, continue with plans for going public.'
If Mr Sekyra has any regrets about abandoning the more ambitious structure
he conceived in 1986, he conceals them well, although it is plain that the
loss of OMV has been a blow.
'OMV faces big challenges. Because our plans to go to the stock exchange
cannot be realised, we are not in a position to help them, so the decision
was right to find a separate way,' he says.
There has been speculation that Mr Sekyra, who is 52, does not get on well
with Mr Viktor Klima, the new minister responsible for nationalised
industries, and will soon leave AI.
However, both men dismiss this. Mr Sekyra says: 'I have a contract until
1996. It is wrong to leave a ship in a storm.'
Mr Klima, for his part, observes that AI still has to concentrate on
restructuring and cost saving. 'Mr Sekyra has demonstrated that he is able
to do these things. I think he really has a lot of strengths for this
period.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / BBC World TV faces CNN attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service Television is about to face a counter-attack from Mr Ted
Turner's CNN International.
The Atlanta-based international television news service has been surprised
by the speed with which the BBC's 24-hour television news service from
London has established itself.
In Asia, for instance, BBC World Service television is available in an
estimated 11m homes with up to 45m viewers 15 months after its launch on the
Star TV system in Hong Kong, a company set up by Hutchison Whampoa.
Mr Tom Johnson, president of CNN, concedes that in the past CNN
International has been too American in its coverage but that is all about to
change. He said: 'We intend to double our international broadcasting in a
single year.'
At present 40 per cent of CNN International's coverage is international and
the rest American orientated. The proportion of international coverage is to
be increased to 70 per cent by the end of this year.
A Dollars 10m development programme has been approved and there will be an
increasing trend to hiring international reporters such as Mr Brent Sadler,
formerly of Independent Television News in the UK, rather than sending
correspondents from the US.
Mr Johnson said: 'We intend to compete aggressively in all areas with the
BBC. He added that he had great respect for the quality of journalism
produced by the corporation.
'We will let the marketplace judge the results of our efforts,' said Mr
Johnson, who believes that there is room for both the CNN and BBC
approaches.
In the past three years there has been a dramatic increase in the
international distribution of CNN. Its service is now on 11 satellites and
there are few parts of the world where it cannot be received.
The BBC aims to span the world with a self-funding television equivalent of
World Service radio by the end of this year. Mr Christopher Irwin, chief
executive of WSTV, said: 'We are on course despite the world recession.'
The BBC strategy has been to set up in business with regional partners -
with the M-Net subscription TV service in Africa and the Nissho Iwai company
in Japan. Subscriptions for the 24-hour European service are handled by
TV-Extra, a subsidiary of Philips, the electronics group.
Mr Irwin said: 'We have witnessed a similar response to the Star TV channels
elsewhere in the continent from Taiwan to the Gulf, where BBC WSTV is
rebroadcast around the clock on a dedicated terrestrial channel owned by
Bahrain TV.'
Even Taiwan, which has strong US links, has a BBC audience of 2m - an
increase of 66 per cent in six months.
Mr Johnson reflects a little wistfully on the fact that CNN was approached
first by Star TV but the two sides were unable to agree a deal. 'We gave the
BBC the opportunity to compete,' he said.

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fila plans flotation on NYSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FILA, the Italian sportswear group indirectly controlled by Fiat, is set to
become the second Italian company to shun the domestic stock market and
float shares directly in New York.
The company is negotiating with US regulators and bankers for a flotation on
the New York Stock Exchange, following a path beaten in 1990 by Luxottica,
the spectacle frames group.
The decision to by-pass Milan and list in New York reflects Fila's growing
penetration of the US market, where sales of its sports shoes have risen
sharply to put it in third place behind Nike and Reebok, and ahead of
Adidas.
The company, which was in poor financial health as recently as the
mid-1980s, has made a remarkable recovery. Operating profits rose by 124 per
cent to L75bn (Dollars 47.5m) last year, while sales reached L500.2bn, up
from L271bn in 1991. Turnover of the group, based in Biella in northern
Italy, is forecast to grow to over L660bn this year.
Fila was controlled by Fiat's Snia-BPD textiles and chemicals subsidiary
until 1988, when Snia-BPD sold for L62bn its 80 per cent stake to Gemina, in
which Fiat is the major shareholder. The remaining shares were acquired from
private shareholders. Gemina is an investment and financial services group
controlled by leading north Italian business families and dominated by Fiat.
Much of Fila's recent growth has stemmed from its expansion into sports
shoes, which last year accounted for more than 60 per cent of sales. In
Europe, the company is still better known for its up-market sports and ski
apparel.
The Fila flotation may be swiftly followed by that of Natuzzi, a south
Italian furniture maker, in which Gemina has a 20 per cent stake. The
company is Italy's biggest maker of high-quality leather furnishings.

sports group

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRIA Tabakwerke, the state-owned tobacco monopoly, is understood to have
agreed in principle to buy the Head sports equipment group for about Dollars
200m.
The monopoly, like other tobacco companies, has been seeking to diversify
away from its dependence on tobacco, partly because of health concerns.
Tabakwerke will also have to give up its monopoly position as a result of
Austria joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free-trade
area being created this year by the countries of the European Community and
most of those in the European Free Trade Association.
Head is a leading international sports equipment group that specialises in
making skis, ski boots and bindings, tennis rackets and shoes and diving
equipment. Annual sales are about Dollars 400m.
The group was the subject of a leveraged buyout in early 1989, which was
arranged by the Los Angeles merchant banking group Freeman Spogli and
financed largely by Sumitomo Bank of Japan and Creditanstalt of Austria.
The shareholder group was led by Lowe Finance of Geneva.
The terms of that deal provided for roughly Dollars 285m of debt to be
supported by only Dollars 50m in equity.
It is understood that while Head has performed well, the leverage in the
capital structure has proven too great.
The desire of Sumitomo Bank to reduce its international lending exposure
also contributed to the decision by the shareholders to sell.
Austria Tabakwerke said it could not confirm that it was purchasing Head.
'We are in the midst of discussions with various parties and nothing has
been settled yet,' a spokesman said.

<TEXT>
CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by Sun Alliance of the UK, is
understood to be in discussion with Baltica, the country's biggest insurer,
for the acquisition of all or part of Baltica's insurance operations.
Shares in Baltica Holding and Baltica Insurance were suspended on Friday,
when the board said that new negotiations for a long-term solution to the
group's financial situation were taking place.
It is understood that the acquisition by Codan is one of the options under
consideration. Analysts estimate the price for Baltica's insurance
operations at between DKr6bn and DKr10bn (Dollars 1.6bn).
Baltica acquired a DKr3.5bn tax-loss deduction when it bought the former
state-controlled life assurance and pension group Statsanstalten
(subsequently renamed Danica) from the government three years ago. Large
losses, however, have prevented Baltica from making use of the tax-loss
deduction, which could be of interest to Codan, the most profitable of the
larger Danish insurers.
The major shareholders in Baltica Holding are France's Suez group, the
Danish ATP national pension fund, the mutual fire insurer Kobstaedernes
Almindelige Brandforsikring, and Hafnia, Baltica's domestic rival which
suspended payments last August.

Channel Holdings, the former investment company known as Channel Tunnel
Investments, is taking a further step in transforming itself into an
industrial group with the acquisition of CQR, a security alarm maker, from
Expamet International, for Pounds 1.72m in cash.
Because of the size of the transaction CH requested a halt to dealings in
the company's shares on Friday. They stood at 25p.
Under the deal Channel has also agreed to procure that CQR repays Pounds
2.08m inter-company debt to Expamet. Also, on completion, CQR will repay a
Pounds 647,000 loan to Expamet from its own resources.
To finance the acquisition Channel proposes to raise about Pounds 4.1m by
way of a placing of 8.74m new ordinary shares and a rights issue of 9.09m
new ordinary, both at 23p per share. The rights will be on the basis of
3-for-5 ordinary and 3-for-1 preference shares.
This acquisition follows the purchase of Carflow Products last August.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Kuwait may cut back independence of KIO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kuwaiti government met yesterday to discuss proposals to merge the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) with its parent institution in
Kuwait, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA).
Mr Abdulla al-Rhodan, the finance minister, has nominated the KIO president,
Mr Ali Rashaid al-Badr, to become chief of both organisations and centralise
decision-making in Kuwait.
The proposal, if successful, could reduce the independence of the KIO and
undermine the positions of many of its non-Kuwaiti investment staff. The KIO
is already considering making redundancies at its London headquarters.
The KIO's Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40.3bn) investment portfolio was cut to less
than Dollars 20bn by the costs of the Gulf War.
Analysts believe the efforts to merge the KIO into the KIA is a direct
attack on the power of the Kuwaiti prime minister and Crown Prince, Sa'ad
al-Sabah.
A public campaign run by the new management of the KIO has convinced
Kuwaitis that former KIO managers lost or mismanaged up to Dollars 5bn in
Spain.
Although the scandal has strengthened critics of the Crown Prince, it is not
clear how quickly Mr al-Rhodan could push through his proposals.
Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, managing director of the KIA and protege of the
Crown Prince, is understood to have still two years of his term to run.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: Omissions regarding Telegraph purchase of Southam
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CONRAD BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Several important facts were missing from your article on March 20
('Purchase of Southam stake by The Telegraph delayed'), about the deferral
of the Telegraph plc extraordinary general meeting to consider the purchase
from its parent, Hollinger (which is not a private company as you reported),
of half that company's interest in Southam, Canada's leading newspaper
publisher.
The deferral of the meeting (likely by less than a week), will enable The
Telegraph to present a supplementary circular describing the changed
circumstances created by the sale of Southam treasury shares to Power
Corporation of Canada. Hollinger believes this development to be wholly
positive. Indeed, it could not have occurred without Hollinger's strong
support.
Power Corporation will average down its cost of Southam shares drastically
with this purchase. The Telegraph and Hollinger will be free to average down
also, if the Southam share price does not rise too swiftly. Southam stock is
now above its price on the date of Hollinger's purchase of the shares, half
of which are being offered to The Telegraph, a price about 50 per cent below
where the company's shares were trading in mid-1990, and Power Corporation
is paying a higher price per share than a generally distributed sale from
treasury would yield.
Most important, your article inexplicably omitted all mention of the
agreement between Hollinger and Power Corporation, whose benefits The
Telegraph will share, which largely vacates the so-called 'poison pill'
arrangements which could have curtailed Hollinger's and The Telegraph's
ability to be a constructive influence at Southam. No such modifications
would have been accepted by Southam without the Power Corporation
investment.
Now, Hollinger and Power, long-standing corporate friends and on occasion
allies, will be able effectively to assist Southam management in
accelerating the profit turnaround that seems already to have begun. The
agreement assures an absolute equality between Power and Hollinger and its
affiliates despite any fluctuations in shareholdings. Power's investment
greatly strengthens Southam at no cost to Hollinger or The Telegraph.
I know of no precedent (and I doubt whether Lex does either) for one
newspaper company to be offered so strategic a shareholding in another great
newspaper company with the right to sell back its shares at its cost for a
year. The only downside to The Telegraph is the interest for the year on the
money required to buy the shares: less than 3 per cent, net of taxes and
dividends. The upside could be astronomical and the addition to The
Telegraph's earnings, through equity accounting, should add appreciably to
The Telegraph's share price.
This is a classic corporate recovery, identified by the same source,
Hollinger, which discovered and made good on the Telegraph and Fairfax
opportunities and which brought The Telegraph the one-year unrealised Pounds
65m capital gain at Fairfax and the six-month Pounds 6m gain on Trinity
International shares.
It is presented to The Telegraph as another outstanding opportunity and I am
confident it will be approved and will be a worthy sequel to those earlier
successes. Given our expectations of being able to raise our participation
in Fairfax and Southam, the proposed investment will also create under The
Telegraph the finest confederation, commercially and editorially, of
newspaper titles ever assembled in one corporate affiliation.
The Telegraph's independent directors and minority shareholders will
short-change themselves if they do not subscribe to this almost-risk free
opportunity. In that unlikely event, Hollinger will be mystified but
consolable to take the entire benefit for itself.
Conrad Black,
chairman,
Hollinger and The Telegraph

demise. The newspaper, which had 55,000 subscribers, faced high costs
because of a union ban on Sunday printing that forced it to print in

Turkish Kurds marked the Nowrouz spring festival with only minor outbreaks
of unrest yesterday, keeping alive peace hopes raised by a guerrilla
ceasefire, Reuter reports from Cizre.
A 15-year-old youth, one of six civilians wounded by bullets when police
broke up an unauthorised demonstration by Kurds in the southern industrial
city of Adana, died of his wounds, a police official in the city told
Reuter. A child was injured and 200 people were detained in Adana, according
to the police chief. But there was no repeat of last year's Nowrouz
bloodbath in which about 100 people died, most of them civilians.
Tanks, armoured cars and sharpshooters kept a tight grip on the
south-eastern towns of Cizre and Silopi. There were few signs of trouble
from Kurdistan Workers' Party guerrillas, whose leader has called a
unilateral 26-day ceasefire.

The Christian Democrat and Socialist parties agree on the need to find an

in extra revenue. However, the Socialists want to avoid higher taxation,
while the Christian Democrats favour large spending cuts and extra taxes.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: Moralist may work miracles - Rafik
Al-Hariri, prime minister of Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rafik Al-Hariri, the 48-year-old Moslem prime minister of Lebanon, appears
too good to be true. The billionaire businessman has given up his role as
head of a multi-national corporation with interests in three continents for
a thankless job with one of the shortest life expectancies. in the world.
Over the next five years he has set himself the task of rebuilding his
war-ravaged country as the financial and trading capital of the Middle East.
His rags-to-riches rise has taken him from a lowly farming background to
membership of the Forbes 100 list of wealthy individuals, with a personal
fortune estimated at between Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn. Of that, he gives
nearly Dollars 90m a year to charity, mostly in the form of scholarships to
poor Arabs.
Since his appointment as prime minister five months ago, thousands of
Lebanese from across the country's political and religious divide have
rallied to the man with the Midas touch. For many Christians and Muslims,
the portly prime minister, known as 'The Sheikh' or 'The Uncle', has become
a symbol of renewed optimism - a personification of the country's belief in
its own renaissance. Across Beirut shopkeepers display his photograph in
their windows and Lebanese newspapers have dubbed him 'Mr Miracle'.
'I was suspicious about him at first,' says Ms Rima Tarabay, an assistant to
the president who used to fight with the Christian Lebanese Forces against
Moslem militiamen during the civil war. 'But he is what he says he is. He is
the only man who can do the job.'
Mr Hariri himself believes he is the only man who can preside over the
restoration of Lebanon - a country almost synonymous with civil war,
terrorism and disintegration. In remarks to donors, diplomats and
journalists, he often says: 'I want to go down in history as the man who
rebuilt Beirut.'
In an interview with the Financial Times he said: 'I think I can serve my
country and make a difference. I have done a lot of unusual things. I had
power without being in this position and I don't need the position to have
power.'
Mr Hariri has set a brisk pace on the road to reconstruction. He, and his
team of 'technocrats', are starting to get to grips with an economy hit hard
by corruption, poverty and mismanagement. The prime minister has speeded up
a Dollars 5bn public and private investment programme to repair the
country's infrastructure and rebuild the capital.
As a sign of confidence in the new government, Lebanese businessmen
repatriated at least Dollars 700m of the estimated Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn
held abroad in the first three months of Mr Hariri's government, allowing
the country to erase last year's balance of payments deficit. The Lebanese
pound has been stabilised and efforts are under way to slash a 1992 budget
deficit of LB1,200bn (Dollars 6.9bn). Next month, the government will meet
representatives of western donor countries in Paris to seek up to Dollars
2.25bn for a three-year programme to repair and upgrade electricity,
telephone, water and other main services.
Mr Hariri has also begun to restore the tarnished image of Lebanon abroad.
The armed militias who once ran makeshift roadblocks across the city and
terrorised the capital have been disarmed. In what has become a mark of his
government, Mr Hariri talks constantly about re-establishing the rule of law
and a moral code of conduct.
'We have a choice: either live according to force or according to the rule
of law. Now in Lebanon we are trying to restore the rule of both domestic
and international law. That is the only way civilised people can live,
otherwise the world will be a jungle.'
Mr Hariri peppers his speech with words like 'ethics', 'morals' and
'principle' as he paces around his study, occasionally feeling the Islamic
prayer beads stuffed into the waistcoat pocket of his suit.
His words appear to be bearing fruit. Mr Hariri's campaign to rehabilitate
his country took a leap forward last month when Mr Warren Christopher, the
US Secretary of State, became the first senior US official to visit Beirut
in nearly a decade.
The restoration of confidence has been boosted by the way Mr Hariri and his
team talk about rebuilding Lebanon as if they are about to put up a small
office block in Texas. 'If things go well, by 1996 we will have an airport
which will handle 6m-7m passengers a year, 1.5m telephones lines, 3,000MW of
electricity and we should have solved the problem of the displaced people
and have a train system across the country,' he said. 'This is not a dream.
It is real.'
This grandiose vision is more believable from a man who started his working
life as a teacher and part-time accountant in Saudi Arabia and who now owns
one of the biggest construction companies in the Arab world, as well as
banks, hotels, and properties across Europe and the US. Most of his fortune
was made building hotels, cities and palaces in Saudi Arabia. He owns homes
in London, New York, Paris, Monaco and Riyadh.
But while his corporate approach to solving seemingly intractable problems
has its advantages, it can also be a weakness. As the honeymoon of his
premiership draws to a close, Mr Hariri is beginning to realise that running
a country is not as easy as running a conglomerate.
His style remains very much that of a tycoon - short nights, long days
starting with 'power breakfasts' with a handful of his closest aides,
telephone calls on portable cellular phones, an impatience with problems and
a tendency to expect his instructions will be carried out promptly.
Sometimes he dips into his private funds to speed up the work programme. His
company paid for the master-plan for the Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn private
sector redevelopment of downtown Beirut which aspires to remake the city
into the 'Paris of the Middle East'.
His 'get things done' executive style of government, has, however, already
landed him in trouble with Lebanon's political class, anxious to protect its
vested interests. Six weeks ago he clashed with President Elias Hrawi, a
Maronite-Christian, over civil service appointments. Mr Hariri had failed to
consult sufficiently with the president. The clash, now resolved, led to a
temporary attack on the Lebanese pound by speculators and symbolised the
lingering suspicion of the Maronite-Christian community about the increasing
power of the prime minister's office.
In an admission of the difficulties in navigating the unfamiliar world of
politics, Mr Hariri said: 'Running your own business, you are the master of
yourself. Here, you have to consult much more.'
Any solution to the political and economic problems of Lebanon will involve
hammering out a peace agreement with Israel, under which Israel will
withdraw its troops from its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.
Without an Israeli withdrawal, Mr Hariri will find it hard to counteract the
Islamic fundamentalist group Hizbollah, which continues to resist the
Israeli occupation, and to press for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian
troops throughout the country to the Beka'a Valley. Without these two signs
of progress, he will be unable to win over the Christian community.
Political stability and economic development will remain elusive.
'Don't underestimate the Israeli occupation in the south of Lebanon. This is
our major obstacle,' Mr Hariri said. 'It is as if we had a poison bullet in
our body. If there is occupation, there is resistance, and reaction to
resistance.'
Mr Christopher's visit undoubtedly boosted Mr Hariri's drive for a solution
to this problem and for Lebanon's bid to be accepted in the family of
civilised nations.
Many observers agree that Mr Hariri has given his country its best
opportunity for peace and economic resuscitation since the civil war began
in 1975. Whether that opportunity is grasped depends largely on the domestic
and international response to his call for the return of the rule of
international law to the region.
'I cannot imagine life without principle or law,' he said. 'Nothing can go
on without a basis of religion, law, principle and morals. I cannot imagine
life and work without that.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / West cannot help Yeltsin: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one can predict the end of the escalating political crisis in Russia. At
one extreme of the political spectrum, there is a danger of civil war; at
the other, a danger of prolonged stalemate between President Boris Yeltsin
and the Congress, leading to the paralysis and conceivably the collapse of
the central Russian state. The one thing which is certain is that the
western bandwagon being drummed up for an emergency international meeting to
help Mr Yeltsin, is misconceived, and likely to make matters worse.
Lead drummer in the bandwagon is President Francois Mitterrand. During a
lightning visit to Moscow last week, he called for an urgent summit of the
Group of Seven industrialised countries, to increase their help for Russia.
Boris Yeltsin was enthusiastic, but not the Japanese. They currently hold
the chairmanship of the G7, and they were irritated that President
Mitterrand should hijack the regular summit which they will be hosting in
Japan this summer.
In any case, they are annoyed with Yeltsin for refusing even to talk about
returning the four northern islands seized from Japan by the Soviet Union at
the end of the second world war.
But the Japanese could not stop the bandwagon. The Germans were ready for an
early meeting; US President Bill Clinton was ready to think about it; all
western countries were worried that Mr Yeltsin and his economic reform
programme could be brought crashing down by the obstructionism of Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov and the Russian congress over which he presides.
Unfortunately, this 'Help Yeltsin' campaign is driven by mixed motives.
After the present French parliamentary elections, Mr Mitterrand will likely
face a hostile conservative government with a huge majority. He needed to
underline in advance, by his visits to Moscow (and Washington), his claim to
control French foreign policy. But in this domestic French debate, Yeltsin's
predicament is purely accessory.
In any case, Mr Mitterrand's recent record makes the campaign suspect on
other grounds. He dragged his feet over the unification of Germany; he used
what influence he had to keep Yugoslavia together; and he did his best to
keep the Soviet Union alive as well. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr
Mitterrand's judgments have been surprisingly fallible.
The problem is that the proposal for an urgent G7 summit has been framed as
a response to the growing constitutional crisis in Russia. It implies that
there is some sudden action which the west could take, which would either
save Mr Yeltsin, or save his liberal economic reform programme, or
preferably both. There is no basis for such an assumption.
There is obviously a strong case for the west to help Russia, if it can be
done; gradually, over a period of years, financial aid, technical
assistance, political advice and foreign investment could be helpful. But it
is doubtful whether the west can do anything directly to change the
political course of events in Russia; it is most unlikely that the west can
intervene effectively in the present crisis; almost certainly it should not
try.
In any case, western perceptions of the power struggle in Moscow seem
distorted by Manichaean oversimplifications: in the white corner is Battling
Boris, the liberal democrat; in the black corner is Retrograd Ruslan, the
power-mad conservative. These stereotypes do not admit the possibility that
Russia may be different. We may believe in the superiority of pluralistic
democracy and market forces; but is it sensible to imagine that the Russians
can knock up from scratch a politico-economic system which took us hundreds
of years? If it comes to that, why should we assume that they would want, or
could use, an implant of one of the many different western versions?
Hear Boris Kagarlitsky on the subject*: 'In repeating the slogans of western
neo-conservatism, the Russian ideologists consciously closed their eyes to
the fact that its key economic concepts were elaborated, and the
prescriptions applied, in conditions utterly different from those now
confronting Russia . . . The proclaimed goal of becoming a developed
capitalist state in the mould of Britain or France is simply objectively
unattainable. It is naive in the extreme to think that the gulf in levels of
development and wealth can be bridged with the help of a few salutary
laisser faire prescriptions . . .
'What sort of privatisation can we talk about in the absence of a
functioning economy, in a country where laws do not operate; where there is
no developed system of commercial law; and, most important, where there is
no civilised and responsible bourgeoisie? . . . The bourgeoisie needs
several generations in the most favourable conditions to come into
existence, and several more generations to become civilised . . .'
The utility of a G7 crisis meeting is unclear. Declarations of western
support did not help Gorbachev; why should they help Yeltsin? They might
easily make matters worse, by ratcheting up the conflict between Yeltsin and
the congress. The west may prefer a victory for Yeltsin and liberalism; but
a victory for congress would only be the second-worst outcome. Much the
worst result would be a prolonged and inconclusive struggle, since that
could prompt the disintegration of power from the centre to the regions and
the republics.
The west can do little to help Yeltsin win; but it can certainly increase
the danger of prolonged conflict and disintegration.

FT  22 MAR 93 / An unreliable third parent: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been reading one of those gloomy essays on the corrosive effects of
television. In the winter issue* of the journal Daedalus, Professor John
Condry of Cornell University argues that dross on the box is stunting the
development of American children. Television, he claims, is contributing to
increased youth violence (including rising rates of suicide), to physical
and mental disorders, and to a secular decline in educational performance.
Children once learned about society, and their place in it, from school and
by directly observing adults in their local communities. Today, says Mr
Condry, television is swamping these influences. On average American
children spend an incredible 40 hours a week watching the box or playing
video games - more than a third of their total waking hours. School,
including time spent travelling and doing homework, absorbs another 40
hours. All other interactions with family and peers - which are potentially
far more productive than TV - have to be crammed into just 32 waking hours,
a fraction of the time enjoyed by past generations.
As well as robbing children of precious time, TV distorts their sense of
reality. Because it is designed primarily to sell things, it has to put a
premium on gaining and keeping people's attention. The easiest way to do
this is by projecting violence. According to Mr Condry the average hour of
children's programming contains 25 acts of violence - far more than adult
TV.
Television distorts in other, more insidious ways. It depicts wealth as the
key to happiness but rarely shows people working hard, because this would be
dull viewing. TV thus leads children to seek 'quick fixes', to want things
but not to see they must work for them. It also presents a dangerously
simplistic moral code, typically dividing the world into heroes, who can do
no wrong, and villains, who can do no right.
Mr Condry's indictment has to be taken seriously. If children spend more
than a third of their waking hours watching TV, their characters must be
moulded by it. Yet his criticisms do not apply to all commercially
successful programming. The producers of the popular series Star Trek, to
take one example, appear quite responsible.
Back in the late 1960s, the starship Enterprise was run almost exclusively
by white males (there was a token black female communications officer and an
Asian helmsman) and toured the universe seemingly looking for trouble. In
nearly every episode, Captain James Kirk proved his manhood by fighting with
some unpleasant alien species (surrogates for the evil Soviet empire) and
falling in love with a beautiful blonde guest star.
Star Trek: the Next Generation (the 1980s' relaunch of the series) shows
distinct signs of progress. The cerebral Captain Jean-Luc Picard has
superseded tough-guy Kirk. A blind black has a responsible post on the
bridge. Women play a more active role and are no longer treated as mere sex
objects; the ship's doctor and security officer, for example, are both
female. As in the first series, the Enterprise is subject to the 'prime
directive' - essentially a code of non-interference.
This year a third series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - has hit the nation's
screens. Perhaps reflecting the more reactive stance of US foreign policy in
the 1990s, it is set on a stationary space station rather than a roving
starship. Waiting, rather than looking, for trouble is the station
commander, Ben Sisko (impressively played by Mr Avery Brooks), a black
single parent. His deputy is a feisty female. The station is packed with
aliens of all shapes and sizes, many of whom dislike and misunderstand each
other - a metaphor for the friction endemic to America's multi-racial
society.
Pushing back social frontiers, one leading character, the demure Lieutenant
Jadzia Dax, is a fusion of two lifeforms. She has the body of a 28-year-old
woman but the memories and (partly) mind of a combative old man and former
mentor to Commander Sisko. This could provide scope for a sensitive
exploration of gender and sexual identity.
Deep Space Nine is not exactly great art. As in previous incarnations of
Star Trek, each episode includes plenty of sanitised violence. But by
reserving the best roles for minorities and women, and by spending as much
time on social problems as on warfare, it at least sends some useful signals
to children. Commander Sisko could become quite an important role model for
young black boys.
But even though some commercial TV may do more good than harm, Mr Condry is
right to argue that the US has paid far too little attention to the social
impact of this 'greedy institution'. It seems pointless endlessly to debate
ways of improving school education when so few restraints are placed on
children's TV curriculum.
Ways could surely be found to reduce the number of childhood hours lost to
the box, to increase the proportion of educational programmes, and to limit
the portrayal of violence. (One act of violence every two minutes seems
excessive even for the US.) After all, few parents would thinkingly consign
their offspring, for 40 hours a week, to an institution as empty-headed and
violent as commercial television.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Test for franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOCUS in foreign exchange markets this week will be on the French franc,
and whether it moves nearer to its floor against the D-Mark in the exchange
rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
Last week's decision by the Bundesbank's policy-making council to reduce its
discount rate by 50 basis points triggered this latest bout of weakness for
the French currency.
The results of yesterday's first round in the French parliamentary election
could also have a significant impact on the franc in the next few days.
According to Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips
and Drew in London, the market was disappointed that the Lombard rate, which
sets the effective ceiling for German rates, was not reduced by the
Bundesbank on Thursday.
However, he believes that foreign exchange dealers had not appreciated that
a cut in the Lombard rate would have been technically difficult because of
the high level of call money, which, on Friday, was at 8.58 per cent. The
recent changes in minimum reserve requirements have temporarily kept the
cost of call money high.
Mr Chertkow believes that the pressure on the franc will be alleviated if
the Bundebank cuts the rate at which it offers funds to commercial banks by
25 basis points to 8.00 per cent tomorrow.
'If they cut rates now, we will clearly have seen in the course of this year
the establishment of an accommodative posture by the Bundesbank,' he said.
Even if the Bundesbank does ease the repo rate again, there will still be
concerns that a new right-wing french government might abandon the franc
fort policy. The market may be anxious to see that an easing in German rates
is followed by a fall in French ones.

FT  22 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports half-year results on
Thursday with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 295m
and Pounds 325m against Pounds 244m a year earlier on sales of about Pounds
1bn.
Retrovir, the HIV-treatment, is expected to generate between Pounds 120m and
Pounds 140m, while estimates for sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chickenpox
medicine, range from Pounds 345m to Pounds 385m.
The main reason for the large range of forecasts is the impact of the dollar
in the US where Wellcome generates nearly half of its sales. Analysts will
be watching how the cough and cold season has progressed, given Wellcome's
non-prescription over the counter business is heavily geared towards
winter-type remedies.
Prudential, the insurer, is expected to report tomorrow a big jump in
pre-tax profits for the year of around Pounds 415m from Pounds 267m,
although forecasts range widely. A much improved second-half contribution
from the US and benefits flowing from the reorganisation of its UK
distribution network are two key factors.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food, household products and toiletries group, should
report on Thursday flat pre-tax profits for 1992 of around Pounds 250m.
P&amp;O, the shipping group, is forecast tomorrow to produce only a modest
increase of around Pounds 10m in pre-tax profits for 1992 from Pounds 217.4m
a year earlier.
Redland, the building materials group, similarly will manage on Thursday a
moderate profit increase of around Pounds 20m from Pounds 186m, including a
nine month contribution from Steetley.
Lasmo, the independent oil company, is expected by some analysts to cut its
final dividend on Wednesday despite an increase in profits to around Pounds
45m from Pounds 17.9m in 1991.
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, announces its 1992
results tomorrow.
It released estimated results, showing an unaudited pre-tax profit of Pounds
147m, a 48.5 per cent increase on 1991,last
month when it announced the Dollars 434m acquisition of Specialty Coatings
international, the US coatings company.
Argos, the catalogue retailer which this week announced the closure of its
four pilot Chesterman furniture stores because of disappointing sales,
presents its full-year results today. Forecasts range between Pounds 62m and
Pounds 66m, compared with last year's Pounds 62.1m.
These, however, do not include the Pounds 12.7m charge for the Chesterman
closure, which is expected to be taken as an exceptional item, and so reduce
pre-tax profits to the Pounds 50m to Pounds 54m range.
Full year results tomorrow from Invergordon Distillers, the independent
Scotch whisky producer, are likely to reflect the increased pressure on
margins in the bulk whisky market. After five years of strong growth,
pre-tax profits are expected to be virtually flat at Pounds 32.4m against
Pounds 32.2m in 1991.
Wolseley, the heating and plumbing supplier, is expected to announce mixed
results when it reveals interim profits tomorrow.
The company is expected to reveal pre-tax profits up more than 20 per cent
to Pounds 40m-Pounds 42m in the six months to end-January. Profits from the
US east coast and the UK are likely to be strongly ahead, although results
from California and France could be disappointing because of recession.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Economics: Europe looks for some cheer from recovery in US
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of economic statistics from the US will underline to what degree
the recovery in North America is getting under way, while in Europe
economists will be watching out for new inflation data from Germany.
With the US likely to provide the main engine for what little growth is
likely in the European and Japanese economies over the next year, relatively
high figures for output growth in the US will raise a cheer in a number of
countries.
Attention will be especially focused on the revised data for growth of US
gross domestic product in the final quarter, due for release on Friday.
In Germany, statisticians are due to announce inflation figures for several
individual states. The Bundesbank will be especially interested in the data,
to determine whether further easing in monetary policy is appropriate after
last week's cut of 0.5 percentage points in the German discount rate.
In the UK, economists will be forced to turn their attention to
non-statistical indicators since few data will be available to illustrate to
what degree the British economy is recovering.
There will be some interest in the answers given by Treasury officials on
Wednesday when they are quizzed in public by the House of Commons' treasury
and civil service select committee. The MPs' questions - expected to be
directed mainly at Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser -
will focus on the strategy behind last week's Budget. The Confederation of
British Industry is bringing out its latest economic forecasts on Thursday.
On foreign exchange markets, observers will be watching out for any signs of
weakness on the part of the French franc ahead of next Sunday's second leg
in the French parliamentary elections.
The main statistical releases and events are as follows. The figures in
brackets gives an average of what financial markets expect, according to
figures provided by economics consultancy MMS International.
Today: UK, Visible trade deficit for countries outside European Community
(Pounds 1.2bn); Japan, March wholesale prices index; Canada, January
seasonally adjusted retail sales (down 0.3 per cent on month).
Tomorrow: Germany, tender for first 5-year Treuhand bond; US, Federal Open
Markets Committee meets in Washington; Canada, January wholesale trade (up
0.4 per cent on month).
Wednesday: Germany, auction of 5-year Treuhand bond; US, February durable
goods orders, durable goods shipments, car sales March 11-20, truck sales
March 11-20, February house sales
Thursday: US, initial claims for week ending March 20, state benefits for
week ending March 13, monetary data for week ending March 15; Canada,
building permits in January (down 4.5 per cent month on month).
Friday: US, release of FOMC minutes of meeting of February 2-3, gross
domestic product growth and deflator in fourth quarter of last year (4.8 per
cent and 2.0 per cent, both at an annual rate), after-tax corporation
profits in fourth quarter (up 6.1 per cent), February bank credit,
export/import price indices; Canada, February industrial and raw materials
production; Australia, February vehicle registrations; Japan, March consumer
prices index (for Tokyo up 1.1 per cent on year, excluding perishable items
up 1.4 per cent; for whole country up 1.4 per cent on year, excluding
perishable items up 1.7 per cent on year), workers' income in January;
February retail sales (down 5.1 per cent on year), February industrial
production (up 0.5 per cent).
During the week: Italy, January industrial production (down 2.6 per cent on
year), February bank lending (up 8 per cent); Germany, March cost of living
indices for different federal states (up 0.3 per cent on month), February
import prices (up 0.4 per cent on month, down 2.3 per cent on year), March
preliminary cost of living index for whole nation (up 0.3 per cent on month,
4.1 per cent on year).

FT  22 MAR 93 / Swiss Bonds: Swiss Eurobond market finally in view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Siegmund Warburg must be chuckling in his grave.
Only two decades after the City of London's great financial innovator tried
to establish a Euro Swiss franc bond market, it is finally about to come
into being.
Warburgs' arrangement of a Swiss franc currency bond issue for the city of
Copenhagen in the 1960s caused a huge outcry in Switzerland, where the
'gnomes' feared they would lose control of their precious currency.
It also led quickly to a syndication agreement among European central banks
restricting membership in bond syndicates in each European currency to
locally domiciled firms. Any issue mounted by a foreigner in any currency
other than the US dollar would be blocked by all the central banks.
These provisions have gradually been relaxed in many European countries but,
until now, they have remained strictly in force in Switzerland. The Swiss,
it seems, got caught up in their own protectionist web.
In the early 1970s, the government introduced stamp duties on securities as
an easy way to raise revenue.
That made it more expensive to issue and trade bonds in Switzerland than
elsewhere but, for many years, when the Swiss franc was a very strong
currency and the Swiss banks' placing power was awesome, it did not seem to
matter.
Foreign borrowers were happy to pay a premium for this service, and buyers,
most of them Swiss institutions, were not much interested in a secondary
market.
In recent years, however, as markets in other currencies have become more
liquid and competitive, the Swiss market has sagged. For a long time, the
banks' entreaties to the government to remove the stamp duties were brushed
aside as greediness.
Last year, after it became clear that the government's revenues from the
duties were declining, Bern finally agreed to act. In a referendum last
September, a majority of Swiss agreed to the government's proposal to reduce
some of the duties and to abolish others, notably those on bonds by foreign
issuers.
Of course, tax reductions never come into effect as quickly as tax
increases, and it is only from April 1 that the stamp duty changes come into
effect.
That, in turn, finally cleared the way for the Swiss National Bank to loosen
its rules respecting syndicates of Swiss franc bonds for foreign issuers.
(If it had liberalised before the duties were removed, most of the
syndicates would have decamped to London to avoid them, to the detriment of
the Swiss financial centre.)
The SNB was originally inclined to remove all restrictions on syndicate
membership in line with European Community policy.
But a few quick phone calls to its counterparts revealed that an 'anchor'
strategy was still being applied in most European countries. That means that
the syndicate lead manager must be locally domiciled. From April 1, that is
what the rule will be in Switzerland as well.
In practical terms, the changes will make the Swiss franc market more
competitive for foreign borrowers.
It should also improve liquidity, by repatriating some of the secondary
trading that has already shifted to London to avoid the stamp duties.
It will also be a relief to many of the extraordinarily large number of
Japanese banks and securities houses with subsidiaries in Switzerland. Most
of them have little hope of being a lead manager; now they can shut their
expensive Swiss offices and participate in Japanese Swiss franc issues from
London or elsewhere.

FT  22 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Signs of slower growth steady prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street tried to shrug off renewed worries about inflation last week,
but it was only partially successful, which raises questions about the
strength of the bond market's long winter rally.
The inflation spectre popped out of the shadows on March 12, when a much
larger than expected increase in the February producer price index knocked
almost 1 1/2 points off the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue in a single
day.
The uneasy tone continued into the first half of last week. However, prices
then rallied and the long bond ended on Friday night with a yield of around
6.81, down 5.5 basis points on the week, in spite of a retreat in prices
earlier in the day.
Market sentiment was helped, particularly at the short end, by Thursday's
Bundesbank move to lower the German discount rate by half a percentage point
to 7.5 per cent, which attracted overseas buyers into US debt.
But the market rally came in spite of a second disturbing inflation report
on Wednesday, in the form of the consumer price index for February. This
showed a 0.3 per cent increase, in line with most analysts' expectations,
though more worrisome was a 0.5 per cent rise in the the core inflation rate
 -which excludes food and energy - for the second month in a row.
Many economists brushed the figures off as statistical freaks. Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged in Congressional
testimony that inflationary trends were off to a 'less than auspicious'
start to the year.
But he dismissed the consumer price statistics as an aberration and pointed
out that labour costs - the 'most fundamental' driver of inflation - were
still under control as corporate productivity rose.
At the same time, recent demand statistics suggest that the economic
recovery has lost some of the momentum witnessed in the fourth quarter, when
GDP rose 4.8 per cent, and many economists are forecasting first-quarter
growth in the 2 to 3 per cent range before a rebound later in the year.
Ms Susan Hering, of Salomon Brothers, argues that contributory factors to
the slowdown in final demand include consumer retrench-ment from the
spending spree of last year's final half; a shortfall in personal tax
refunds; stormy winter weather; and a mildly negative response to President
Bill Clinton's economic package.
This growing perception of slower short-term growth has helped steady bond
prices over the past week, yet the re-emergence of the inflation spectre
could start to change the dynamics of the market.
Few economists yet see escalating inflation as a serious threat, though Mr
Erich Heinemann, of Ladenburg, Thalmann, warns that 'if inflation continues
to accelerate through the spring and summer, there will be shock waves in
both Wall Street and Washington.'
However, the statistics of the past two weeks will at the very least erode
the perception that inflation may still be ebbing. And if the market comes
to believe that inflation has reached the bottom of the cycle it may prove
hard for long bond prices to make much further progress, without a touch of
tightening from the Fed.
No one is expecting any early move by the Fed. The bank's policy-making Open
Markets Committee, which meets this week, seems certain to keep monetary
policy on hold while it weighs the strength of the recovery and inflation.
But the potential for some lively internal Fed debates over the next few
months seemed to be underscored on Friday when Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Fed
governor, said the economy was 'closer to full employment than we might
expect'.

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Investors unsettled by rise in RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt market is poised for an increase in yields across the maturity
range after the steady increase in prices in recent weeks.
A possible taste of what is in store came on Friday, when prices at the long
end of the yield curve fell by about half a point on worse-than-expected
news on UK retail price inflation. For short-dated gilts, yields fell by 15
to 20 basis points on the week as financial markets absorbed implications
that the UK government is unlikely to cut base rates from their current 6
per cent in the near future.
At the long end, prices rose marginally on the week. The yield on the 8.75
per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2017 fell to 8.30 per cent on Friday
night, from 8.33 per cent the previous Friday.
The small upward movement in prices for long-dated gilts seen last week may,
however, be difficult to sustain. That is because of the inflationary
pressures that may be building up, together with the price-depressing
effects of an estimated Pounds 45bn programme of gilt issues in the
financial year beginning next month.
The 1.8 per cent increase in the retail prices index in the year to last
month, after a 1.7 per cent year-on-year rise in January, unsettled some
gilt investors. The unease was magnified by news that the underlying
inflation rate, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage payments, was 3.4
per cent in February. In January, the corresponding year-on-year rise was
3.2 per cent.
The inflation data might indicate that higher import costs following the 13
per cent fall in sterling since September are working their way into the
economy.
The big funding programme for 1993-1994 will get under way a week on
Wednesday when the Bank of England will auction between Pounds 2bn and
Pounds 4bn of stock in the maturity range 2008 to 2013. Details of the
specific bonds, the amount to be auctioned and the terms will be announced
tomorrow.
During 1993-94, auctions are to take place roughly once a month. They will
be the main way of financing the PSBR for the year, which Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor of the exchequer, said last week in his Budget statement
would be about Pounds 50bn.
The chancellor's simultaneous announcement of an end to the full funding
rule - meaning that purchases of gilts by banks and building societies would
count towards the PSBR - was welcomed in the gilts market. However, the
direct impact of the change on the funding programme may be minor.
At present, the incentives for banks and building societies to buy gilts at
around the five-year level, after borrowing at shorter maturities at lower
interest rates, is far from overwhelming. That problem could be rectified in
the event of a steepening of the yield curve at the short end. However, the
most likely way in which this could happen - through a cut in base rates
sanctioned by the government to speed recovery - is considered not
particularly probable, on the grounds that a fragile upturn appears to be on
the way.
That certainly was the inference from the announcement last week that
seasonally-adjusted unemployment dropped by 22,000 last month, the first
fall in three years. Even so, the position on interest rates is extremely
fluid, given that Mr Lamont's three-year package of fiscal tightening
announced in the Budget should, in theory, give him plenty of room to ease
monetary policy should evidence arise of continuing weakness in economic
activity.
As for the PSBR, by the end of the week the gilt market had recovered from
its initial alarm at the high estimate for 1993-1994 unveiled by the
chancellor. In the Budget in March last year, the Treasury's corresponding
forecast had been for a Pounds 32bn deficit, while in the November Autumn
Statement the department put the figure at about Pounds 44bn. Many in the
gilt market, however, had already accepted that the Treasury's previous
forecasts were too optimistic and had adjusted their own projections.
According to last week's Budget projections, the deficit will come down to
Pounds 44bn in 1994-95, Pounds 39bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 35bn in 1996-97.
That compares with unpublished Treasury estimates in early-1992 of Pounds
35bn, Pounds 29bn and Pounds 16bn for the three years in question. The
numbers which were eventually published in last year's Budget were Pounds
25bn, Pounds 19bn and Pounds 6bn respectively.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: Regulators offer blueprint for US futures
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSED change in US regulations could put the US futures market on a
more even footing with the over-the-counter swaps market, at a time when
competition between the two markets is intensifying. US futures exchanges
also hope that a more liberal environment will help stem their loss of
market share to European exchanges.
Last week, Mr William Albrecht, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates futures trading, put forward
ambitious proposals for the liberalisation of rules governing US futures
exchanges. Speaking at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in
Boca Raton, Florida, Mr Albrecht said he had asked the CFTC's staff to draft
a proposed rule that exchange products traded on electronic systems and used
by institutional investors should be exempt from most CFTC regulations.
This would mean that, apart from rules governing manipulation and fraud,
exchanges meeting these requirements would not have to seek CFTC approval
for new contracts, rule changes, and so on.
In practice, it would allow exchanges to enter part of the territory
currently controlled by the OTC market. In particular, it would make it
easier for them to break into the Dollars 4,000bn swaps market.
US exchange officials tend to have a rather ambivalent attitude to the swaps
market.
On the one hand, they realise that banks and securities houses in the swaps
market are also active users of futures markets, to lay off risks. On the
other hand, they are also aware that the growth of the OTC market has been
generated by that market's ability to tailor OTC products to specific client
needs.
Last year, it was confirmed that swaps were exempt from CFTC futures
regulations. Consequently, the swaps market is not directly regulated, but
most of the players are (either by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
the case of securities houses, or by the Federal Reserve in the case of
banks).
Mr Pat Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said that the proposed
rule change would create 'a level playing field so we can not only
complement but compete with the OTC market.'
He added that there had been a blurring of the line between swaps and
futures, citing the growing secondary market in swaps and the fact that
swaps are now used for a variety of reasons, including speculation on
interest rate movements, in the same way as futures. Mr Arbor suggested that
a suitable exchange instrument would be a Dollars 10m swap contract from
fixed to Libor-linked floating rate interest.
But the chances of Mr Albrecht's proposal seeing the light of day are
probably slim. As acting chairman of the CFTC before the appointment of a
new head by President Bill Clinton, he admitted he hoped the proposal might
help force the hand of any new chairman into reforming current regulations.
However, the move runs counter to the trend followed by most US regulators,
whose approach has generally been to extend rather than retrench their
powers where possible.
Mr Albrecht, however, shares the view of market practitioners that changes
are needed in order to halt the flow of business to less regulated markets
overseas.
'Our regulatory system dates back to the 1930s. All we have done is add on
rather than taking anything out,' he said. Consequently, regulation has not
kept pace with developments such as electronic technology and the challenge
of fresh regulatory approaches in overseas markets. 'With electronic trading
systems, there is an electronic audit trail which makes it easier to detect
violations,' Mr Albrecht said. 'If people know they will get caught, they
are less likely to commit violations.'
In response to proposals from Mr Jack Sandner, head of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, that the current array of regulators should be
streamlined into a single authority, Mr Albrecht said: 'The question of how
many agencies we have is less important than the rules they are supposed to
be enforcing.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling issues on course for a
bumper year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of a flood of Eurosterling issues in the international bond
market have been fulfilled during the last few weeks, and the rush does not
appear to be over yet.
According to the new international bond issues tables published daily by the
Financial Times, volume of new sterling Eurobond issues so far this year has
reached Pounds 8.1bn, compared with just under Pounds 3bn at the same stage
last year, when UK bond yields were significantly higher.
In view of the prolific start to the year, last year's total of Pounds
13.7bn of new sterling Eurobond issues looks an easy target to beat.
Syndicate managers believe that a total of between Pounds 16bn and Pounds
20bn could be raised in the international bond market by the end of 1993.
The overriding reason for the high new-issue activity in this sector is
clearly the fall in UK interest rates to their lowest level since the 1970s.
This has prompted an increasing number of foreign and domestic issuers to
take out fixed-rate borrowings at what they regard as attractive, absolute
levels. The Eurosterling sector has also offered attractive interest-rate
swap opportunities to borrowers, especially at the shorter end of the yield
curve.
At the same time, there has been a marked increase in demand from domestic
investors for fixed-income instruments that offer higher yields than
short-term cash deposits.
In addition, an improving outlook for the UK economy, together with
sterling's recent recovery on the foreign exchanges, has whetted the
appetite of international investors for sterling-denominated paper. 'The
time is right for borrowers and for investors,' said one syndicate manager.
Several of the sterling-denominated deals rumoured in the market have
surfaced. British Gas tapped the market for Pounds 400m, followed by Abbey
National, which raised Pounds 650m of 10-year Eurobonds - a record for a
single Eurosterling transaction. Last week, the Republic of Finland launched
its Pounds 500m, 10-year Eurobond issue.
However, syndicate managers expect more non-sovereign borrowers to tap the
market before the Easter break, encouraged by the strength of the UK
government bond market in the wake of the UK Budget and the latest reduction
in German interest rates.
A significant portion of the sterling-denominated paper issued so far this
year has been raised by financial institutions looking to bolster their
capital base.
This trend continued last week, as HSBC Holdings and Lloyds Bank both
launched long-dated subordinated Eurobond issues, of Pounds 250m and Pounds
200m respectively. Both deals were well-received by the market, resulting in
a tightening in the yield spreads over comparable gilts on these issues.
Continued demand from investors for high-yielding, long-dated paper has
fuelled speculation that the other two UK clearing banks, Barclays and
National Westminster, will launch similar deals in the near future.
Corporate issuers are also said to be closely studying the Eurosterling
market, especially now that the 1992 corporate reporting season is almost at
a close.
Mr Frank Kennedy, sterling bond analyst at SG Warburg Securities, notes that
investor demand for non-gilt sterling paper has contributed to the sharp
drop in the yield spread that corporate borrowers have to pay over gilts.
According to SG Warburg Securities' corporate unsecured index, the spread
over gilts for maturities of 10 years or more has fallen from 153 basis
points at the end of 1992 to 130 basis points at the end of last week.
'The performance from non-gilt sterling paper has been very strong, but
investors still find the spread attractive,' says Mr Kennedy.
He warns that the level of corporate borrowing this year may fall short of
the market's expectations, in spite of hopes for an economic upturn.
Furthermore, some corporate treasurers may hold out a little longer,
especially if they believe that interest rates have further to fall.
Nevertheless, there is general agreement among syndicate managers that the
sterling sector will be much more active and profitable in 1993 than it was
last year.
It is too early to say which house will get the biggest slice of the action,
and the volume figures so far this year are to a certain extent distorted by
the large transactions mentioned earlier. But those volume figures still
make interesting reading.
At the end of last week, SG Warburg Securities was in the lead, with Pounds
1.4bn, or around 17 per cent of the volume, followed by CSFB with around 14
per cent and Samuel Montagu with 13 per cent.
But the real surprise is Goldman Sachs, which has appeared from virtually
nowhere (it arranged a modest Pounds 350m of sterling Eurobond issues last
year) to fourth place in the sterling league table, with Pounds 930m, or
11.5 per cent of volume so far in 1993.
Goldman Sachs is the only US house with a significant presence to date in
the sterling primary market. It has also raised its profile by jointly
arranging the deals for British Gas, Abbey National and Lloyds Bank.
Mr Michael Sherwood, head of syndicate at Goldman Sachs, attributes this
achievement to the house's strategy of developing its secondary market
trading before going into the primary market. 'We now feel very comfortable
in the primary market,' he says.

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: State to float majority stake in
Dutch telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH government has decided to sell a majority stake in the state
telecom company PTT, ending months of speculation over what proportion of
the company would be privatised, Reuter reports.
The first tranche of the flotation will be offered to the public next year.
The exact amount to be sold, who will arrange and underwrite the offer and
what level the company will be valued at remain the subject of debate,
financial sources said.
But at an estimated total value of Fl 15bn (Dollars 8bn), the fight for rich
adviser fees is under way. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was named
adviser to the company at the end of January. Dutch, British and US firms
head the field of contenders for the more lucrative underwriting and
co-ordinating roles.
PTT will have to jockey for postition in an already-crowded European
privatisation calendar. In addition to the third tranche of British Telecom,
PTT is competing against several at least three other groups, including
Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and Sweden's Procordia.

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: VME plunges to Dollars 94m net
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VME, one of the world's largest producers of construction equipment, plunged
to a net loss of Dollars 94m last year due to a recession described by Mr
Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive, as 'unprecedented in modern
times'.
The loss at the Brussels-based company compares with a deficit of Dollars
45m in 1991, but includes one-time costs of Dollars 19m related mainly to
restructuring in North America.
Sales slipped slightly to Dollars 1.36bn from Dollars 1.39bn
VME's two parent companies, Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US,
pumped in a total of Dollars 100m last year to support the company. But Mr
Johannesson, in an interview, said VME's balance sheet was strong.
The group had also recently arranged a club deal with a group of German,
Belgian and Swedish banks that, over time, would be very advantageous for
the company.
'Fundamentally, we are in good shape, and I am optimistic in a reserved
way,' Mr Johannesson said.
This year's result would be considerably better than 1992's, even though VME
is budgeting for a further 8 to 10 per cent fall in volumes.
Mr Johannesson said that heavy rationalisation over the past three years,
together with big improvements in productivity and manufacturing processes,
would help VME achieve the improved result.
Employment at the group, which was formed in 1985, has fallen from 10,400 in
1990 to 6,600.
By the end of this year, with the closure of the St Thomas plant in Ontario
this summer, it will reach 6,000.
Apart from a general reduction in volumes on leading markets, price
competition and restructuring costs, VME's performance last year was also

The company produces 65 per cent of its equipment in Sweden, and the krone
was 'strongly overvalued' until the devaluation in November, said the VME
chief.

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Buffett predicts lower returns
from US stock market over next decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in the US stock market over the next 10 years will not be so
lucrative as in the previous decade, according to Mr Warren Buffett, one of
the nation's most celebrated investment gurus.
Mr Buffett, chairman of the Omaha-based investment group Berkshire Hathaway,
says in his annual letter to shareholders: 'The return over the next decade
from an investment in the Standard &amp; Poor's index will be far less than that
of the last decade.'
He says the reason is that increases in stock prices have for a long time
been ahead of growth in corporate earnings.
'It is clear that stocks cannot forever out-perform their underlying
businesses, as they have so dramatically for some time, and that fact makes
us quite confident of our forecast that the rewards from investing over the
next decade will be significantly smaller than they were in the last.'
Mr Buffett's folksy letter repeats some of his investing precepts, including
sticking to businesses 'we believe we understand. That means they must be
relatively simple and stable in character. If a business is complex or
subject to constant change, we're not smart enough to predict future
cash-flows.'
He also advises avoiding new share issues, arguing that 'an intelligent
investor will do better in the secondary market.'
The new-issue market, according to Mr Buffett, 'is ruled by controlling
stockholders and corporations, who can usually select the timing of the
offerings or, if the market looks unfavourable, can avoid an offering
altogether.
'Understandably, these sellers are not going to offer any bargains.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bitter meeting for Clark on bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark the family held shoe manufacturer riven by
shareholder dissention, faces a potentially acrimonious meeting today as it
attempts to decide which of three bids for the company it will recommend.
Berisford, the commodity and property group, tabled its formal offer on
Friday, thought to value Clark's at about Pounds 160m. It is believed to be
an all-share offer, underwritten for cash.
The bid is conditional on approval from a majority of the nine-strong board
and the grant of exclusive due diligence rights to Berisford.
Fii is believed to be offering a similar deal, which values Clark's at about
Pounds 140m.
Finally, an investment consortium comprising existing institutional
shareholders and backed by Electra Investment Trust, is thought to have
offered about Pounds 2 a share, or Pounds 154m.
A member of the Clark family, which owns or controls 80 per cent of the
company, said he was opposed to the planned sale. It is believed that a
group of family members is seeking to co-ordinate opposition to the sale at
the AGM later this month.
'My concern is that it (a sale) is being presented as something which has
been agreed by the company - which it has not,' he said.
The extraordinary general meeting in October had agreed only to determine
the best price for Clark's, following a bid approach backed by Electra. The
board had also promised to investigate options for those who wanted to sell
their shares.
The dissident shareholder said that an outright sale of Clark's had 'very
little to do with the interests of the company.'
'Furthermore, he added, 'the current prices being talked about are terribly
low.' Even if the family wanted to dispose of the company, he said 'it seems
a crazy time to sell'.
At least 40 per cent of the family shareholders are thought to oppose the
sale of Clark's. Four members of the nine-strong board - who are also of the
Clark family and sought to unseat the chairman and a director last year -
are likely to object to the sale. At least two of the bidders have indicated
that some or all of the management at Clark's would remain.

The Irish government is considering helping GPA, the financially-troubled
aircraft leasing group, by taking a stake in the company worth around
IPounds 10m - IPounds 15m.
GPA has to find buyers for a Dollars 200m convertible share issue by this
time next month to ensure its continued survival.
According to reliable business and government sources in Dublin, talks are
underway between GPA and the Shannon Development Authority, a regional
development agency in the west of Ireland, where the GPA headquarters is
based, to buy an equity stake in the company.
It is thought that the development agency is considering buying up to 10 per
cent of the new share issue.
A spokesman for GPA said yesterday 'There are a lot of negotiations going on
with existing shareholders and potential new investors.'
GPA has some Dollars 5.5bn in debts and has been in difficulties since its
aborted flotation last June.

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach tag could exceed Pounds 120m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH, the Perth-based company which operates bus services all over the
UK and in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is planning to raise Pounds 20.6m
through a Stock Exchange flotation next month which could value the company
at more than Pounds 120m.
The company, which has expanded rapidly through the acquisition of
privatised bus companies in the UK and abroad, is forecasting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 12.8m for the year to April 30 1993, up from Pounds 8.24m
on continuing operations in 1992. Turnover was Pounds 104.3m for the 36
weeks to January 9 1993, compared with full year turnover of Pounds 131.4m
in 1992.
The pathfinder prospectus for the flotation is issued today. The sponsor is
Noble Grossart, Edinburgh merchant bank, and stockbroker UBS Philips &amp; Drew.
Analysts believe the shares could command a price earnings ratio of between
13.5 and 14.52. They believe the company would be valued at over Pounds
120m.
After flotation, which will lead to borrowings of about Pounds 20.6m being
replaced by equity, Stagecoach will save about Pounds 2m in interest
charges, which will raise the forecast earnings per share from the 7.8p
stated to about 9.3p. After flotation Stagecoach will have net assets of
Pounds 43m.
The company says it has identified possible acquisitions among the 32
remaining municipal bus operators and the 10 operating companies in London
Buses which the government plans to privatise.
Mr Brian Souter, 38, the chairman, and his sister Ann Gloag, 50, managing
director, who founded Stagecoach in 1980, are expected to sell shares worth
about Pounds 13m but will still end up owning more than 50 per cent of the
company.
Eight Scottish institutions which own convertible preference shares would
end up owning 13 per cent of the equity if they convert all their shares but
are also expected to make some realisations.
Some 18 per cent of Stagecoach's 11,000 staff own shares, which if held will
lead to them owning about five per cent of the company.
The price should be announced on April 6. The offer will close on April 16
with dealings beginning on April 20. Prospectuses can be obtained by
dialling 0645 100640.

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram chairman under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL ROONEY, chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the kitchens and
bathrooms company, is under pressure to relinquish one of his two posts.
Some institutional shareholders believe Mr Rooney must take some of the
blame for the recent surprise profits warning.
A financier close to the group said: 'There is a question mark over Mr
Rooney's role.
'I think it will be very difficult for him to stay as chairman and chief
executive.'
The company's directors, and advisers NM Rothschild and Panmure Gordon, have
made it clear that they will be listening to what shareholders have to say
at today's presentation of its results.
Last week the company said the 1992 pre-tax figure would be not less than
Pounds 26m, down from a restated Pounds 36.2m in 1991. Analysts had
predicted Pounds 37m to Pounds 40m.
The directors will decide shortly after today's meeting whether to seek a
replacement for Mr Stuart Greenword, finance director, and the company's
auditors, Arthur Andersen.
A number of big shareholders have already told the company that Mr
Greenword's position has become unten-able.
One said: 'It is not just that pre-tax profits will be far less than we
thought. We are talking about a serious breakdown in communications between
the company and its shareholders, which has happened once too often.'
Spring Ram's profit warning followed haggling with its auditors over the
implementation of more conservative accounting principles.
Some Spring Ram directors feel its auditors were too conservative in its
accounting methods in order to counteract the damage of last year's
revelation of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary.

FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italian telecoms group profits
steady at L133bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALTEL, the Italian state-controlled telecommunications equipment group,
reported virtually unchanged net profits of L133.2bn (Dollars 8.4m) against
L132.5bn the previous year.
Earnings would have been higher but for a substantial increase in tax to
L128.5bn from L101.3bn in 1991 and a sharp rise in one-off payments for
early retirement, which reached L61.5bn against L37.8bn in 1991. Sales rose
7.7 per cent to L2,973.4bn, undimmed by a 6.4 per cent fall in average
prices as part of cuts in the cost of Italian telecommunications equipment.
Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the future industrial strategy of
Italtel, which is controlled by the Stet telecommunications holding company.
Although AT&amp;T, the big US telecoms group, retains a 20 per cent stake, Stet
is known to be in talks with several multinational telecoms groups over the
possibility of buying shares in Italtel, in an attempt to achieve economies
of scale and widen access to technology.

LOMBARD Continental Insurance, the provincial insurance arm of US group
Continental Insurance Company, is to be bought by its management for Pounds
32m.
The new company will begin trading in June and includes all the incumbent
senior management currently responsible for the provincial business.
In 1992, Lombard Continental had gross premium income of Pounds 70m - 65 per
cent of which came from personal insurance.
Mr Andrew Laing, the new managing director, said: 'Our business will
continue to focus on the provincial insurance market. The current hardening
of rates in the insurance market and our selective underwriting policy
provide us with every opportunity to develop our business successfully.'
Mr Laing added that an independent chairman was presently being sought. Two
non-executive directors are also to be appointed, one of which is to be a
nominee for Electra Kingsway, the lead investor in the venture.
Other institutional investors include Phoenix Development Capital Fund, Bank
of Boston and Brown Shipley Venture Managers.

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch Group seeks listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING market share and optimism over prospects for the London insurance
market were among the reasons given yesterday by Fenchurch Group for its
plans to seek a stock market listing, probably early next year.
Insurance analysts estimate it could be worth up to Pounds 80m.
Fenchurch, which specialises in insurance broking and as Lloyd's agent, was
bought by management in 1989 from GPG for Pounds 36m.
Its former chairman, Mr Geoffrey Knight, who led the MBO team, retired last
week to be succeeded by Mr Rupert Hambro.
Profits fell last year from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.45m, but Mr Roger Earl,
the group's managing director, said these reflect - ed the start-up costs of
the group's expanding activities.
'We have laid the foundations in the past year for revenue earners which
should come through to the balance sheet in the next 12 months. The signs
are very encouraging', he said.
Last month, Fenchurch won the contract to insure the former Soviet Union's
trading fleet.
The contract for the 117-strong Sovconflot, one of the biggest commercial
fleets in the world, was worth a 'high six-figure number', according to Mr
Earl, and complemented similar business deals struck in Cuba and North
Korea.
Fenchurch has also opened offices in the past year in Germany, Switzerland
and a management consultancy in Texas, as well as additions to the group's
core operations in London.
All businesses were now operating in the black, said Mr Earl.
He added that the group's debt of Pounds 21m would be reduced significantly
with the proceeds from the flotation.
It would also give Fenchurch the chance to pay its first dividend to the 250
shareholders among its 550 staff.

FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays new loan procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, is making senior executives personally
responsible for their mistakes when making big corporate loans, following
the Pounds 240m losses which it made on Pounds 422m of loans to Imry, the
troubled property group.
The change in lending procedures emerged as Chester Holdings, Imry's parent
company, disclosed that it had a deficit on shareholders' funds of Pounds
357.6m on March 31 1992.
These losses were in part absorbed by holders of Chester's subordinated loan
stock totalling Pounds 161m. However, Barclays was forced to write off
Pounds 197m from its loans to the group and has made additional provisions
to cover possible further losses.
Accounts filed at companies house also show that Chester made a pre tax loss
of Pounds 105m last year and an after tax loss of Pounds 158m.
Barclays exposure to Imry stems from its 1989 loan of Pounds 214m to
Marketchief, a financial vehicle which acquired Imry in a leveraged buy -
out.
That loan was intended as a bridging facility. However, Marketchief was
unable to pay it off as quickly as hoped, so in the middle of 1991 Barclays
decided to put in place a longer term facility.
A banker said yesterday that the security given on the original loan was
inadequate. Barclays wanted to secure an improved charge over Imry's assets
when making the new longer term loan, but was prevented by the terms of a
Pounds 175m 'club' loan from a group of banks to a separate Imry arm, called
Imry Merchant Developers.
Barclays decided it was vital to take an improved charge over the assets, so
it took the unusual step of lending a further Pounds 199m to pay off the
Pounds 175m club loan. The club was led by Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Hill
Samuel, National Westminster, Bankers Trust, Citibank and Midland, each of
who provided Pounds 18.5m.
A club member yesterday described Barclays actions as providing 'manna from
heaven'. The club, whose agent was Citicorp, was in a powerful position when
negotiating with Barclays because a condition of the club loan was that it
became immediately repayable if there was a change of control of Imry - and
the financial reconstruction of Marketchief amounted to a change of control.
A banker said that Barclays has subsequently punished executives involved in
the original Marketchief loan. However he added that assigning
responsibility for the Imry mistakes was difficult, because at least ten
executives had been involved in the lending decision, including three
directors whose rank was just below that of the main board.
So Barclays has now instituted a new system for approving big corporate
loans. No matter how many Barclays employees are involved in the process of
making a loan, there will always be one senior executive who takes personal
responsibility for the loan.

Last week's deal, in which Primerica bought Shearson for Dollars 1bn (Pounds
672m), underlines a trend towards consolidation evident on Wall Street since
the early 1980s, but which now may be coming to a close.
As one chairman of a leading Wall Street house said of the merger: 'This is
the culmination of a process that has been going on since the early 1980s -
one more step in the rationalisation of the securities business.'
Some 10 or 12 years ago the early phase of consolidation was either about
building fully integrated securities houses that could prosper in both the
retail and wholesale markets, or creating 'financial supermarkets' by
bringing securities firms and providers of related services under the
umbrella of huge diversified corporations.
Only one large firm, however, succeeded in becoming a big, fully integrated
securities house, and that was Merrill Lynch (although on a smaller scale,
PaineWebber has built a modest presence in investment banking to go with its
retail strengths).
And none of the attempts to create financial supermarkets - notably American
Express with Shearson Lehman Brothers, and Sears Roebuck with Dean Witter -
succeeded.
It is clear the big corporations that sought to build financial supermarkets
paid too much for their securities units in 1980s. When the securities
business went sour in 1988-1990, they tried to get rid of them but could not
find buyers.
When the industry returned to profitability in 1991, buyers began to emerge.
Two parent groups, Sears and American Express, have taken the opportunity to
sell part or all their securities units.
Two others, General Electric, which owns Kidder Peabody, and Prudential
Insurance, which owns Bache (now called Prudential Securities), may be
looking for buyers over the next year or so.
As for those Wall Street firms that failed to make it as integrated houses,
ever since the start of the 1990s they have been concentrating on either
broking or investment banking.
The creation of Smith Barney Shearson, and the splitting of Shearson from
its old investment banking partner Lehman Brothers, is part of a process
that has been going on for several years. The merger certainly makes it
easier to see how the structure of the US securities industry now looks.
The brokerage business is dominated by a small number of large firms, of
which Merrill and Smith Barney Shearson are by far the biggest. Below them
come a handful of medium-sized houses, such as PaineWebber, Dean Witter,
Prudential and Bear Stearns.
Merrill, however, is different from its nearest rivals in one important
respect - it is also a dominant force in investment banking, where it
competes with a small band of global investment banking powerhouses such as
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and CS First Boston.
This group concentrates on providing underwriting, financing and advisory
services to corporations in the US and overseas.
Below the big brokers and investment banks, come the smaller players -
securities firms such as Alex Brown, Donaldson Lufkin and Brown Brothers
Harriman, investment banks such as Dillon Read, and finance boutiques such
as Blackstone - which thrive by specialising in just a few areas of the
securities business.
Among the groupings, Prudential Securities and Kidder Peabody are the odd
ones out, because they are still owned by large parents. They have yet to
undergo the final part of the consolidation process - a merger or a takeover
 -and GE and Prudential Insurance would probably sell them at the right
price.
Smith Barney Shearson, meanwhile, faces a difficult first year of life. In
leaving behind the Lehman Brothers investment banking unit at American
Express, Primerica's chairman Mr Sanford Weill made clear he was not
interested in building an integrated securities house. Instead, the new firm
will concentrate on what Smith Barney and Shearson did best when they were
independent - selling stocks to the investing public.
In terms of size, Smith Barney Shearson is not far behind Merrill Lynch. The
new company will have 11,000 brokers, 495 branches, and mutual fund assets
under management of Dollars 62bn. Merrill has 11,500 brokers, 458 branches
and Dollars 117bn under management. The gap between the two is likely to
widen, however, because Mr Weill will have to cut fat from the new
operation.
While Smith Barney, under the careful eye of Mr Weill, was generally
regarded as trim and efficient, Shearson's cost base had become bloated. In
particular, employee compensation was rising faster than productivity. The
most common criticism analysts have aimed at the firm has been that Shearson
was paying too many people too much money.
Mr Perrin Long, securities industry analyst at First of Michigan, estimates
that between 2,000 and 4,000 people could go at the new company, and not all
from the cost-laden Shearson.
It is too early to tell how much savings can be wrung from the merger, but
Mr Frank Zarb, president of Smith Barney and the newly appointed chief
executive of SBS, has said he expects to take between Dollars 100m and
Dollars 200m out of costs in the first few years.
Although he insisted there would be no lay-offs among the company's broking
force, analysts cannot see how costs can be cut without shedding some
brokers.
Most of the jobs cuts, however, will come from the back office operations.
But merging the two companies' broking forces will pose human problems.
Smith Barney's strength as a broker was in the top end of the market,
catering to richer individual investors.
Shearson brokers, however, have always aimed much lower, and have earned a
reputation for hard-sell tactics. Yet, in spite of Shearson's more
aggressive selling, Smith Barney's brokers have been consistently more
productive than Shearson's.
Merging the two cultures, and avoiding the kind of clashes and rivalries
that undermined Shearson's alliance with Lehman Brothers, will be one of the
most difficult tasks facing Mr Weill and his senior managers over the next
year.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Pirelli close to truce with Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyre company, is close to ceasing hostilities against
Continental, after a two and a half year campaign to gain control of its
German rival. The Italian company last week agreed in principle to sell its
5 per cent stake in Continental and also to cancel arrangements with
corporate allies who control a further 25 per cent.
According to a senior executive involved in negotiations between Pirelli and
Continental, attempts are being made to place this combined holding of 30
per cent in Continental with institutional investors.
However the executive stressed that the share sale was not certain, because
Pirelli has insisted that the disposal must be made at a premium of around
10 per cent to the market price.
Under the terms of the share sale agreement, if buyers cannot be found for
the entire 30 per cent, none of the shares will be sold. Continental's share
price was DM208.5 last week, valuing the company at DM1.83bn (Pounds
752.5m).
Continental is being advised by Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and
Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's UK merchant banking subsidiary. Morgan and
Deutsche's securities arm are leading the process of finding buyers for the
shares.
Pirelli has in the past claimed to control more than 40 per cent of
Continental shares. It has options giving it the right to buy 30 per cent
from allies. In addition, Pirelli also believed that two other holders of
Continental shares, controlling 10 per cent, were supporters.
However, Continental believes that a placing of only 30 per cent would end
hostilities between the two companies.
Pirelli has made huge losses as a result of its raid on Continental. It and
its allies bought their shares when they were priced at more than DM300.
The Italian company's original intention was to force Continental to buy its
tyre subsidiary, to create Europe's biggest tyre manufacturer. Continental
rejected the merger plan on advice from Morgan.
Since then, the two companies have been locked in legal disputes about
whether Pirelli has voting rights over the shares it holds under option.
Continental has been keen to end the dispute because it has absorbed
management and financial resources. In addition, Pirelli was able last
summer to block Continental's attempts to raise new capital.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: A high price to pay for high wages in
the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A week ago, German politicians were jubilant about agreeing on a solidarity
pact aimed at financing the economic reconstruction of eastern Germany. But
a deepening wage dispute in eastern Germany is dampening the euphoria.
IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade union, is threatening a strike
if its members in the five eastern German states do not receive a 26 per
cent pay increase beginning on April 1.
This pay increase stems from a March 1991 contract designed to bring eastern
German wages up to the level of their western German counterparts by April
1994 but which the employers are now trying to revoke.
The contract was made between the former communist managers of east German
industry, Gesamtmetall, the west German employers association, and IG
Metall. For political reasons, the managers wanted high wages for its
employees, regardless of the cost.
The west German employers saw high wages as a way of preventing eastern
Germany from posing any serious competition for western German companies.
But the agreement failed to take into account the very different levels of
productivity in the two economies. Today, eastern German wages are about 70
per cent of western German levels, but productivity in the steel,
engineering, and electrical sectors is 70 per cent below western German
levels.
The result is that unit labour costs in the east are already 80 per cent
above western German levels. Economic forecasts for 1993 show that eastern
Germany's gross domestic product will total DM201bn (Pounds 82.65bn), while
the wage bill will exceed DM248bn. In western Germany, GDP for this year is
estimated to be DM2,223bn, and wages around DM1,555bn.
Gesamtmetall has realised its error and is now trying to pull out of the
contract, invoking a revision clause giving it the right to do so in view of
the deteriorating economic conditions in eastern Germany. It is prepared to
offer a 9 per cent increase.
IG Metall is now threatening to call an all-out strike on April 1 and has
already staged a series of warning strikes throughout the region.
Mr Heiner Flassbeck, a senior economist at DIW, the German Institute for
Economic Research in Berlin, says that the chance of the emergence of a
strong, and vibrant mittelstand, the small and medium-sized companies which
formed the backbone of the western German economy, is unlikely to prosper if
unit labour costs continue to rise.
A report published by the DIW shows that, in a survey of 3,200 privatised
eastern German enterprises, 60 per cent have serious competitive problems.
Many are not generating profits largely because, as the graph shows, in
eastern Germany there is hardly any gap between the labour costs and
productivity per hour. This means that existing enterprises are not in a
position to invest, let alone think of expanding, while the obstacles to new
small enterprises are high.
'These enterprises face external and internal pressures,' says Mr Flassbeck.
'The external pressure is from the Bundesbank. Interest rates are still too
high. Banks will not lend to these enterprises because they are strapped for
cashflow. The internal pressure is from IG Metall. Wages are too high,' he
added.
Mr Flassbeck argues that a 26 per cent rise will deter foreign (and western
German) investment, and prevent investment by the new eastern German
enterprises.
IG Metall says that if it caves into the employers and accepts a 9 per cent
rise, the employers will have won the first round in their attempts to
undermine Germany's collective wage bargaining system.
It also argues that it wants a 26 per cent increase for its members because
eastern Germans have to pay western German prices for most items.
The chemical and energy and utilities sectors in eastern Germany, however,
have settled for 9 per cent.
IG Metall also knows that if its members are afterwards made redundant they
will obtain more unemployment benefit because benefits are linked to wage
levels.
Yet the 1.2m already unemployed in eastern Germany will not benefit in any
way from a 26 per cent increase. The already massive cuts in east German
employment largely explains why productivity in eastern Germany rose at a
rate of 60 per cent from the beginning of the first quarter of 1991 to the
last quarter of 1992.
Economists at DIW believe that IG Metall's high wage demands will mean that
the sacrifices of the unemployed in eastern Germany will have been made in
vain: they have no chance of getting work because money saved from their
jobs, instead of being invested, will have been soaked up by wages.
IG Metall might yet be prepared to compromise by putting back the timetable
towards income parity in return for job guarantees and/or subsidies for its
members who work in enterprises which are not yet privatised.
Its members fear for their jobs and do not have the stomach for a strike.
But any compromise will be useless if it fails to give the fledgling
enterprises in eastern Germany an opportunity to start allowing wages to lag
behind productivity costs which would then give them a chance to invest and
compete.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Telegraph directors to decide on Southam stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, chairman of Hollinger Group and The Telegraph, yesterday
said he was confident that independent directors of the UK newspaper group
would not change their recommendation to buy a stake in Canada's Southam
newspaper group.
The Telegraph's board will meet on Thursday following news that Power
Corporation, the Canadian newspaper group, is buying shares in Southam more
cheaply than the UK newspaper group.
Some of the Telegraph's independent directors are concerned that Mr Black
agreed to Southam's issue of 13m shares to Power at a price of CDollars 14
each, days after they recommended that the Telegraph should pay CDollars
18.10 a share for half of Hollinger's 22.5 per cent stake.
Mr Black said he understood the 'sensitivity' surrounding the sale. However,
he said that without Power's involvement he could not have 'emasculated the
so-called poison pill' which effectively prevented Hollinger from increasing
its stake above 23.5 per cent in Southam without making a full bid.
Power and Hollinger will now be able to take their combined shareholding up
to 47 per cent and to any percentage after two years. Mr Black said Power
and Hollinger were 'longstanding corporate friends and on occasion allies'.
Mr Black believes the poison pill arrangements could have curtailed
Hollinger's and The Telegraph's ability to be a constructive influence at
Southam. 'Somebody had to break the ice' said Mr Black.
After Thursday's board meeting, NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which
handled The Telegraph's flotation last summer, will write to shareholders
explaining the background to Power's involvement. The Telegraph has
rescheduled the extraordinary general meeting, at which shareholders will
vote on the purchase, from March 30 to April 5.
Lord Swaythling, an independent director, said: 'The Telegraph's purchase of
Southam's shares was an excellent deal at the time Hollinger asked us to
participate and it is no less of a good deal since Southam's share price
fell on news of its results which enabled Power Corporation to pay less for
its shares.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / CrossRail bill may be reactivated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BILL authorising construction of the Pounds 2bn CrossRail link, the
biggest public transport project planned for central London, is expected to
be reactivated soon after Easter as the government seeks to counter
accusations that it is trying to shelve the scheme.
Last week the chancellor said, in his Budget speech, the project would be
re-examined as a candidate for private sector finance as part of the
government's attempt to attract more private funding for transport
infrastructure projects. This gave rise to fears of long delays for the
scheme because it had previously been agreed that it would be funded wholly
by the public sector.
But the CrossRail bill, dormant since its introduction to the House of
Commons last year, is now likely to be reactivated and given a second
reading in May.
The underground British Rail link between Paddington station on the western
side of the capital and Liverpool Street on the eastern side would enable
thousands of commuters to travel beyond the two terminuses to the West End
and the City without changing to London Underground's overcrowded trains.
At the end of last week, the Corporation of London, the City's governing
body, published a strongly worded report pouring cold water on the idea of
getting private funding into CrossRail and other projects. A co-author of
the report, Mr Stephen Glaister of the London School of Economics, said:
'There is a real danger that waiting for private sector finance to dig this
project out of a financial hole risks losing it altogether.'
Department of Transport officials yesterday emphasised that the Budget
restated the government's commitment to the project and said the Pounds 200m
allocated to preliminary work on the scheme over the next three years
remained in place.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Rise in basic pensions ruled out: Concern grows over
compensation scheme for fuel bill tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday appeared to rule out an increase in basic pensions
to compensate for the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel bills.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, pointed out that many
pensioners were not on low incomes. To provide them with special help would
'miss the target'.
Mr Dorrell's comments are likely to increase concern among some Conservative
backbenchers over the controversial measure to levy VAT at 8 per cent on
domestic fuel from April 1994 and at 17.5 per cent the following year.
As MPs prepared to vote on the Budget resolutions tonight, Labour stepped up
its attack on the government over the issue, accusing ministers of having
'torn up' the commitments made last Thursday about extra help with fuel
bills.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday called the Budget 'a bonfire of
John Major's election promises and Conservative party election pledges'.
Labour will target Tory MPs who serve on the committee to discuss the
finance bill, contrasting their own election pledges with last week's
announcement.
Interviewed on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, confined himself to offering help to 'poorer' pensioners and
families, likely to total about 10m people.
He explicitly ruled out doing so by exempting people in need from paying VAT
on fuel bills, saying that such a course would be expensive, inappropriate
and an 'administrative nightmare'.
Although Mr Andrew Bowden, the Tory chairman of the all-party pensioners'
group of MPs, last week urged extra help for pensioners who just fail to
qualify for income-related benefits, Mr Dorrell appeared to rule out doing
so through the basic state pension.
'If we want to help people on low incomes, and the government has made it
clear that in the context of this VAT change we do want to help people on
low incomes, then to take pensioners as a category would be to miss the
target,' he said on BBC radio.
Mr Lamont refused to give a figure for the amount of extra help that would
be provided in compensation. He added, however: 'This measure in the Budget
is designed to raise revenue. I want to help those in adverse circumstances,
but I do not want to give it all back.'
Tory MPs are certain to press the chancellor to give a definitive statement
of the government's plans when he winds up the budget debate tonight.

FT  22 MAR 93 / US battles to hold share of Japanese chip market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KONA, HAWAII
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US-Japan battle over semiconductor trade is not over yet, in spite of
the surprise announcement on Friday that the long-sought US target of a 20
per cent foreign share of the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) Japanese
semiconductor market had finally been achieved.
The US is now pressing Japan for continued improvement in foreign access to
its semiconductor market by maintaining an average 20 per cent foreign
market share over the next 12 months.
Japanese officials said, however, that they would 'reject out of hand' any
suggestions for further quantitative measures of market access. As trade
officials and industry representatives from both countries gathered in
Hawaii for semiconductor trade talks that began yesterday, it was evident
that sharp differences remained which could have important implications for
trade relations in this and other sectors.
Officials from both countries were surprised by Friday's announcement that
the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market was 20.2 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1992, a 4.3 percentage point jump from the previous
quarter.
Although the market share rise alleviated trade tension, it also raised new
questions about the use of market share as a quantifiable indicator of
market access.
Japan has always vigorously denied that the 1986 semiconductor agreement
guaranteed foreign chip manufacturers a fifth of the Japanese market.
The Japanese government's resistance to further use of market share data has
been hardened by US suggestions that a similar approach might be applied in
other sectors.
However, the sharp increase in the foreign share of the Japanese chip market
in the fourth quarter could be explained more by economic conditions in
Japan than by the significant increase in foreign semiconductor sales. US
officials acknowledge that the size of the Japanese semiconductor market
declined drastically.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Bosch cuts pay rises in attempt to reduce staff costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSCH, the German electrical, electronics and motor components maker, is to
cut pay increases agreed with its domestic workforce in an attempt to reduce
costs.
Uhde, a chemical plant manufacturer, is to 'export' jobs to foreign plants
with the same aim in view.
The moves reflect the crushing impact of recession on German industry, which
is now running out of 'easy' options in its search for payroll economies.
Hundreds of companies have introduced early retirement schemes and stopped
hiring replacements for leavers.
However, the cost-saving potential of natural wastage is virtually exhausted
in many sectors. Compulsory redundancy is almost unknown in Germany, and
employers are searching for other means to economise.
Announcing a 'first step' at the weekend, Bosch said it would pay a 3 per
cent pay increase, agreed with the IG Metall union last year, and due to
take effect on April 1.
However, the rise would apply only to national basic pay levels. Other
payments would be excluded from the calculation, the group said.
Non-union employees, who were awarded a pay increase last autumn, would be
asked to show 'solidarity' and take a 3 per cent pay cut from the same date.
Management had already agreed to 'considerable' salary reductions.
According to early estimates, the measures would save around DM250m (Pounds
106m) in a full year, the company added. Bosch, which slipped into operating
losses in the second half of 1992, said at the weekend that improvement was
unlikely this year.
'Negative economic developments and increasing competitive pressure have led
to a considerable drop in profits and damaged international
competitiveness,' a statement noted.
The group has shed 12,000 workers worldwide in the last 14 months, and some
24,000 employees are now currently on short-time rotas.
The weekend action followed unsuccessful negotiations with workers'
representatives at group level in which management sought voluntary cuts on
a range of extras and bonuses including 25-year service awards, lunch
subsidies, nursing care and spa cures.
At Uhde, a subsidiary of chemicals giant Hoechst, management announced a
switch of manufacturing strategy in which only 40 per cent of its
3,000-strong workforce would in future be employed in Germany, compared with
60 per cent at present.
Mr Lothar Jaeschke, chief executive, said the costs of employing an engineer
in India, for example, were between 50 per cent and 80 per cent lower than
in Germany.

FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Food retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK food retailing industry is in a transitional phase. The sector's
shares are too. Fundamentals suggest grocery stocks remain undervalued. But
such considerations have been swamped this year by a surge of adverse
sentiment. There may be relief that the chancellor has - at least
temporarily - refrained from extending VAT to all food products. Yet other
fears have gnawed away valuations.
The hoary old saturation debate has raised its head again. The discount
sector seems set to flourish. The promised US-style warehouse clubs may not
instantly see huge slices of market share changing hands but they will
create a new price floor. Food volumes have fallen to their lowest level for
more than a decade and will only recover slowly. The restrained spending
seems not so much a factor of consumer confidence but cash: high
unemployment rates and low earnings growth mean there is limited money in
shoppers' purses.
Despite such worries, the big grocers will record some solid earnings gains
this year thanks to their prodigious opening programmes. Isosceles's
continuing misfortunes will provide opportunities for cannibalistic growth.
The devaluation effect will eventually feed through to prices, perhaps this
summer. By then, recovery should have firmly taken root. In such uncertain
times the market believes that - apart from special situations like Asda -
it is wise to stick with quality stocks, such as J. Sainsbury and Wm
Morrison. It is difficult to disagree.

FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lamont also held out a little noticed but juicy carrot for the UK
insurance industry. Insurers have long argued for the right to set aside
tax-deductible general reserves against unspecified future losses. The
Budget gave them cause for celebration by promising a consultation paper on
the issue. Swings in profits caused by natural catastrophes could be ironed
out by such equalisation reserves. European insurers enjoy a competitive
advantage in the London market by being allowed to create them.
Yet there is plenty of scope for disappointment in the fine print.
Equalisation reserves would be of little value if they were restricted to
minor classes of business. The big gains would flow from reserves against
future losses on property and household accounts. Only then would
shareholders funds be protected from hurricanes or deep recessions. If the
government and the Inland Revenue are prepared to go that far, insurance
companies may be more inclined to maintain dividends through the cycle and
the sector would be a less volatile investment.
The industry will still have to argue its case. Smoothing profits goes
against the grain of recent UK accounting reforms. The continental practice
of setting up general reserves discourages transparency. Insurance companies
which are free to reserve to the hilt on the upswing may also be tempted to
write bad business in difficult markets. Far from smoothing the insurance
cycle, equalisation reserves would then only add to the problem.

FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Infrastructure funding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's Budget may have signalled a real revolution in the private
funding of infrastructure projects. Mr Norman Lamont's comments certainly
showed a renewed enthusiasm for the concept. The cynical view is that this
will only lead to a re-run of the frustrating - and largely futile - debate
following the Ryrie rules of the early 1980s. But there are certainly
greater grounds for optimism this time round.
The most important factor is the significant shift in Treasury thinking
contained in its guidance for joint venture infrastructure projects. In the
past, the Treasury has balked at investing public money in projects and
simply transferring the rewards to the private sector. But it now appears
prepared to do so if it is accompanied by a complete transference of risk.
Any continuing government involvement in projects would threaten the PSBR if
costs ran out of control. For private sector companies, the profit
motivation must be coupled with a real fear of bankruptcy.
Government money is clearly needed at the start of infrastructure projects
when the risks are primarily political. Further subsidies may be needed in
the course of construction. But, if the government is not to bear any
residual risk, the private sector must at some stage assume full
responsibility for its completion. As long as the Treasury and the private
sector can draw that line in an appropriate place, there is now a chance of
mixed infrastructure projects working.

FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: French test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange market always promised itself some sport around the
French election. It seems reluctant to forgo the opportunity even though the
result should not make a great deal of difference to policy. In opposition
the right was committed to a strong franc. Only after the second round next
week will the final shape of the new government be known and the real test
of that conviction begin. In the meantime there is little chance of the
outgoing administration giving way. To desert the ERM as one of its last
actions in office would be to drink from the poisoned chalice. It would
surely rather hand it on.
Nonetheless it may now require a vicious squeeze on short-term rates to
discourage speculators from selling the franc short. Its vulnerability is
clear. The new government may want to establish its European credentials,
but it also has to tackle unemployment - and that requires much lower
interest rates. An agreement on closer monetary co-operation with Germany
might help but it is difficult to conceive of one that will convince the
markets without infringing national sovereignties. The guilder's special
relationship with the D-Mark is purely voluntary. It works because the
guilder is a small currency that can be easily manipulated and has a
stronger track record than even the franc.
If the new government proves its determination, short-term rates might fall
quite quickly to the German level. But real rates would even then be
positive by an unsustainable 6 per cent. French exchange rate policy would
be much more plausible if the Bundesbank helped by cutting rates more
quickly. So far it has been too grudging for comfort. The repurchase rate it
sets this week will matter more to the future of the ERM than the poll
result in France.

Hearing the dreadful stories of how revolting French fishermen are

can beat the French at their own game by using poisson distribution to
calculate the exact probability of further interruptions.
If the average destruction rate is 10 crates of cod an hour, applying the
poisson gives an 11 per cent probability of 8 crates being destroyed in any
one hour and a 7.5 per cent chance of a 15 to 30 minute delay between
onslaughts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's think-tank industry, like the rest of the country, has not escaped
the recession. Money has been tight, Big Ideas have been in short supply,
and existing output has been hit by theoretical disputes. Hence, this week's
launch of Demos, the first new think-tank of 1993, is a welcome event.
At first sight it might look like a Marxism Today conspiracy. After all
Demos' chairman is Martin Jacques, 47, a former editor of the magazine and
once described as the most prominent British communist of his generation.
Director Geoff Mulgan, 30, is an old buddy of Jacques' and there are plenty
of old Marxism Today buffs on the advisory council.
However, the presence of successful business folk such as Courtaulds
Textiles' Martin Taylor, Northern Foods' Chris Haskins, and Dennis
Stevenson, who is chairman of the Tate Gallery and a member of the City
Takeover Panel, suggests that it is not going to be dominated by the loony
left or the nutty right. Its membership comes from a surprisingly broad
church.
That said, its list of aims is a bit long-winded. Any think tank which
cannot sum up its purpose in one sentence is going to find it hard to get
its message across.

It's not only the big shots who have been brought to book by Japan's
anti-crime drive. Brief fame has just been won by a run of the mill
commuter, identified only as a 39-year-old office worker from Tokyo, who
achieved a national record for rail ticket fraud.
For five years he travelled back and forth flashing an out-of-date rail
pass, successfully trusting to the ticket collectors' inability to imagine
that a worker warrior would ever do anything so uncharacteristically
Japanese.
When one finally challenged him, however, he made a full confession and has
agreed to make reparation to Japan Railways as well as paying a fine. In
all, it is costing him about Pounds 80,000.

Why should the Conservative members of the European Parliament give up their
offices on the third floor of the European Parliament's London outpost in
Queen Anne's Gate and move into the Tory party's Smith Square headquarters?
The official line is that it is all to do with winning next year's European
elections. 'We want to have one integrated election fighting machine', says
Tim Collins, the Tory party's exceptionally young director of
communications.
Maybe so. But the suspicion remains that the party's forgotten tribe of MEPs
has been ordered in to the expensively refurbished Tory party HQ to help
reduce the overheads. Unlike, Queen Anne's Gate, the Smith Square
accommodation will not be provided rent free.
Fortunately, the financing of the Conservatives in Europe is on a much
sounder footing than that of the Conservatives in Britain.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Retirement home feud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court now has one lady aboard and may soon get another, but
it remains a brotherhood at heart. And as in even in the most closely knit
fraternities all is often not sweetness and harmony.
Take Justice Byron White's announcement on Friday that he was resigning
after 31 years. The instant suspicion was that he had pre-empted one or two
other justices contemplating retirement so as to lay claim to the fine suite
of offices in the existing Court building vacated by the death earlier this
year of former Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Retired justices are entitled to offices in the Court itself where four
suites are reserved for this purpose. However Chief Justice William
Rehnquist has been trying to persuade ex-justices to move down the road to
the new Thurgood Marshall building in the revamped Union Station complex.
The problem is that the three living former justices - Warren Burger, Lewis
Powell and William Brennan - have refused to budge from their quarters. They
say they were appointed for life to 'this building.'
Chief Justice Rehnquist, a conservative, is thought to be particularly
disturbed by the influence exerted by Brennan, 84, a powerful liberal
intellectual, over Justice David Souter, appointed by President Bush to fly
the conservative flag but proving to be distinctly moderate in many of his
judgments.
Justice White has said he would 'likely' move to the new quarters. But this
is exactly what Brennan, who has a great sense of mischief, said he would do
when the chief justice first mooted the idea and Messrs White and Brennan
are great friends, though not ideological soulmates.
If he does go, then it is a fair bet that Harry Blackmun or John Paul
Stevens, the liberal pair reckoned the next likely to retire, will not be so
accommodating. Rehnquist may end up having to move to Union Station himself
in order to distance himself from his liberal ex-brethren.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Yeltsin at last plays his hand: The gamble taken by the
Russian president in his decision to impose special rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the embattled president of Russia, has broken out, a move
which now seems to have been inevitable. Penned in by decisions of the last
Congress of People's Deputies - which gave parliamentarians the right to
cancel his decrees instantly and even to suspend the office of the
presidency, Mr Yeltsin has taken his tail from between his legs and stung
his opponents into decreed oblivion.
He told the country on Saturday night that he had 'signed a decree on
special rule until the power crisis is overcome'. On April 25, a 'vote of
confidence' in the president and General Alexander Rutskoi, his
vice-president will be held throughout Russia. At the same time, another
popular vote will be held on a draft constitution and draft electoral
legislation. If these are passed, elections for a new parliament will be
held under the provisions of the new constitution and the revised law.
Mr Yeltsin also said that the structure of the new parliament would be
wholly different from the present Congress of People's Deputies and its
smaller permanent Supreme Soviet, but he was not specific about any changes.
In the past, he has expressed a preference for a bicameral assembly.
Until the deputies are replaced, the president added, they may continue to
work - but 'no decisions . . . which aim to change or suspend commands or
instructions of the president or resolutions of the government have any
legal force'. At the same time Mr Yeltsin has directed Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to draw up a law on the private ownership
of land.
In the main, Mr Yeltsin's directives are unlawful, violating numerous
articles of the Russian constitution. Article 121, for example, explicitly
states that the president cannot disband or suspend the parliament. Other
provisions repeatedly declare that the Congress is the supreme power in the
country and that it has the right to do anything it wishes.
Mr Yeltsin's actions were described as a 'coup' by Mr Valery Zorkin, head of
the Constitutional Court, who cut short a visit to the US at the end of last
week because of the crisis. Yesterday he convened an immediate sitting of
the court. Though compromised by his failure to guarantee the December
agreement between Mr Yeltsin and the parliament to hold a referendum, Mr
Zorkin remains the country's senior law officer, and he gives the judgments
against Mr Yeltsin the imprimatur of his office.
However, the Russian president did not claim that his actions were
constitutional. Instead Mr Yeltsin has justified them on three grounds: his
election by all of the people; the threat of a reactionary movement
organised by the Congress; and his support for urgent constitutional and
economic reforms. Together with his commitment to continue to respect human
rights, this reasoning - while not quelling every qualm - was enough to
produce declarations of firm support from leading foreign governments for
his continued leadership of the Russian reform process.
Meanwhile, Mr Yeltsin told the army to stay out of the conflict between
himself and the Congress. The military leadership will probably be grateful
that he did not ask for their direct support. Interior troops and the
security services are also unlikely to intervene, at least not overtly, for
the moment.
Mr Chernomyrdin, who addressed parliament yesterday afternoon, was also
supportive. 'In these conditions, it is not at all easy to pull ourselves
out of an economic crisis,' he said. Nonetheless, the government was solidly
behind the president because of the need to break out of the chaos and to
'defend the constitutional order as a whole'.
Yet the opposition in parliament believes that it commands the moral high
ground. The president is acting unconstitutionally, it contends, and he is
rushing the nation towards civil war. Indeed, one of Mr Yeltsin's longtime
supporters, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet
foreign minister, commented that the possibility of internal conflict in
Russia appeared so real 'that I can almost smell it'.
'The worst has happened,' Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker,
told legislators yesterday. He repeated that his belief was that the
president was 'in breach of the constitutional laws'. He said that even
though Mr Yeltsin had asked for a vote of confidence in both president and
vice-president, he could not co-sign such a decree. He has thus put himself
(not for the first time) in the opposite camp.
But how have the Russian people reacted? A few thousand supporters of each
side - separated by lines of police - yesterday rallied round the White
House, the Russian parliament building. Hardliners supporting the Congress
tried to beat up an American TV crew, and a Reuters correspondent quoted an
elderly lady - carrying a portrait of Stalin - saying she was fighting
against dictatorship.
Yet recent polls have suggested that public apathy is growing. Some show
that as many as 70 per cent see recent political events as having no
relevance whatsoever to their lives. The Russian people, as Mr Yeltsin has
himself observed, are infamous for their spells of passivity broken by
sudden explosions. If this pattern holds true, the polls are alarming.
Mr Yeltsin's domestic and foreign supporters - who are split on the
advisability of his tactics but broadly behind him in doing something to
break out of the stalemate with parliament - have two principal concerns:
first, that his gamble of going to the people will be technically possible;
and second, that the people should vote in large numbers. Neither can be
assured.
It is still unknown precisely what Mr Yeltsin means by a 'vote' on April 25.
It is presumably not to be a referendum or Mr Yeltsin would have said as
much. Referendums, moreover, are absolutely ruled out by the constitution -
something Mr Yeltsin has appeared to accept.
If the vote is to be an informal plebiscite, about which he has spoken
often, a great deal of organisation is necessary: people need to be able to
vote at polling stations; supervision is required; votes must be counted;
and it must be seen to be fair. A plebiscite will also take millions of
roubles, and there is as yet no word on where the funds will be found.
A full-fledged referendum needs at least 50 per cent of the electorate
voting before it is valid. A plebiscite would need no such thing, but the
turn-out would have to be more than, say, 25 per cent if it is to be taken
seriously. Even such a modest level may be too much to expect in present
conditions. However, supporters of this strategy say that, with a four-week
campaign, and a populace roused by rhetoric and struggle, the issue may be
dramatised enough to stir heavy participation.
A final question is whether Mr Yeltsin can keep on the peaceful path he
clearly wishes to tread. Can he hold out to the leading industrial companies
a reasonable prospect of being a stable partner in their increasingly
frenzied efforts to find some way of assisting him?
He has showed his cleverness by allowing the Congress to continue to meet
and work. He is under no obligation to arrest them; he can ignore (under the
terms of his own decree) any resolutions which may cancel his orders; and if
the Congress impeaches him, or attempts to strip him of powers, it must then
act - which, in the end, means it must secure the allegiance of at least
part of the armed forces.
Even though this puts the ball in his opponents' court, it also represents a
great danger. Each side in the confrontation, in seeking to make its power
paramount, must command loyalty of one or other of the armed forces. It is
not impossible - indeed, it is relatively easy  - to envisage a split
between forces loyal to the parliament and those loyal to the president,
rather like a replay of the English civil war three centuries on. Mr
Yeltsin, it was reported yesterday, has already renamed the elite Kremlin
guard as the presidential guard, and put it under his direct control.
'He must have gone mad,' said Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in an interview with
Italy's La Stampa yesterday, schadenfreude getting the better of him again.
Mr Yeltsin clearly has not gone mad. But he is equally weary, perhaps
fearful - perhaps even losing heart. He will need every ounce of it for the
struggle to come.

FT  22 MAR 93 / How to misuse the price mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A luggage trolley is one of the most useful of innovations, and, like many
such, did not require sophisticated science and technology, but merely
someone to think of the idea. It enables the feeblest person to transport
his or her luggage without being fleeced by the red-coated 'privatised'
porter services to be found, for instance, at Heathrow Airport.
Alas, rarely has a good idea been put into effect for long when someone sets
about spoiling it; and the bad example is copied. Imagine my chagrin when I
arrived at Brussels airport a few years ago to find that a coin was required
to release a trolley. Although I had small denomination Belgian notes, I did
not have the coin required. The banks and newsagents were closed; and none
of my fellow passengers was able or willing to provide change.
Since then the habit has spread to other airports and to railway stations.
The idea seems to be to find a new deterrent to cross-border travel now that
customs barriers are coming down. It never seems to dawn on the clever
idiots who installed the system that banks normally supply foreign exchange
in notes; and not even flight attendants carry loose change.
Yet a further horror has been invented which I first discovered at Zurich
railway station. This is to make the traveller pay a somewhat larger sum -
two Swiss francs as far as I remember - but to return the coins when the
trolley is finally deposited at the curb or on the platform. It is extremely
difficult to discover how to make the extraction, and I am usually more
concerned to secure my taxi than make the effort. Similar devices have
apparently been installed in some supermarkets.
The trolley charging systems look at first sight like an application of the
price mechanism, but on closer inspection turn out to be a misapplication to
the point of caricature.
Other things being equal, the price of a trolley should roughly correspond
to the extra ('marginal') cost to the airport or railway of providing this
service, for an appropriate charge helps in the allocation of resources.
With the right pricing policy, there is an incentive for the airport or
station to make available the appropriate number of trolleys - not too many
or too few - and for the passenger to use them only if the advantage
outweighs the cost.
The snag in the above argument is that the gains in welfare from the use of
the price mechanism are heavily outweighed by the discomfort and
inconvenience. If you want to be pompous you can talk about the disutility
of striving too earnestly to maximise utility. There are many other examples
where separate charging is not worth the bother. Hotels do not charge
separately for light, heating, water, room-cleaning, and so on.
The transport authorities are simply trying to recover their costs. In that
case would it not be simpler to add a small sum to the airport or station
charge, which would be incorporated in the fare? The disincentive effect of
the charge (as distinct from the nuisance cost of finding the coin) on the
number of passengers using trollies, must be vanishingly small. So there
would be almost no effect on the allocation of resources.
As for the fear of stolen trolleys, this is farcical for airports. A trolley
cannot be put in a waiting car or taxi without anyone noticing. Even at
railway stations most illicitly taken trollies go to nearby hotels - whence
they would be brought back by departing passengers for the same reasons of
convenience, if the rail authorities did not criminalise the activity.
The main reason why the issue is one of public policy is that airports and
mainline rail terminals have a local monopoly, whether privatised or not.
Supermarkets, where the danger of theft is less risible, can be left to make
their own decisions, although even here bodies such as the Consumers'
Association need to ventilate the issue, and make sure that customers are
fully informed of where shopping remains easy. But where monopoly applies,
the regulatory body needs to say: 'No, No, No.'

PRESIDENT Yeltsin could not have been clearer, in his televised address on
Saturday, about the choice now facing the Russian people. In the plebiscite
planned for April 25, they have to decide whether the leader they elected by
a 57 per cent majority in June 1991 is to be allowed to get on with the
economic and democratic reforms he then pledged to undertake, or whether
they prefer to be ruled by an assemblage of anti-democratic relics from the
old Soviet state.
In putting the question, and in giving himself 'special powers' between now
and the plebiscite, Mr Yeltsin is taking an enormous gamble. It comes
perilously late in the day, when much of his political capital has already
been spent. It is also not clear if he has thought through precisely how to
frame the vote or to proceed thereafter: on Saturday he vowed to seek
approval for a new draft constitution and electoral law on top of a vote of
confidence, an agenda which may prove unmanageable.
What is certain is that the Russian president has no choice but to seek a
renewal of his popular mandate if he is to retain any capacity to pursue his
reforms - and that the west has no option but to swallow any discomfort
about the constitutional niceties and support him in the attempt. In doing
so, western governments need to be aware of the dangers. They cannot afford
to become so entwined with particular personalities in Russia's internal
struggle that they lose their freedom of action or judgement. They cannot
ignore the possibility that power has seeped away from the centre to such an
extent that neither Mr Yeltsin nor anyone else can now prevent chaos in
Russia.
They can and should, however, make emphatically clear that they believe the
reforms President Yeltsin symbolises to be the only path towards a peaceful
and prosperous Russia in the long term; that the alternatives propounded in
the Congress of People's Deputies are a recipe not for 'order' but for
increased disintegration and conflict; and that assuming the plebiscite
results in the creation of a more legitimate and coherent power structure in
which reforms can be pursued, a serious, concerted and highly visible
programme of financial assistance will be made available.
The key words here are 'in the long term'. Mr Yeltsin's gamble can only pay
off if it is the start of a sustained process. He cannot expect to produce a
satisfactory constitutional settlement in a rush, and he cannot wait until a
new constitution is in place before taking steps to make economic reform and
financial stabilisation begin to work. That will almost certainly mean
having to ask in the plebiscite for the extension of his special powers for
a finite period while elections are held and deliberations completed on
Russia's political future.
It is a daunting challenge. The west should do what it can to secure
success, but should start thinking now about the consequences of failure.

IF SAVING the Russian reform process is now the most urgent issue for
discussion between the US and its European allies, saving the Uruguay Round
and averting a global slide into protectionism is hardly less so. Indeed,
the two issues are closely connected. In the immediate crisis, a heated
argument over trade issues would distract political leaders from the Russian
problem and make it harder for them to agree on a plan of action. In the
longer term, the west's ability to help Russia (or indeed anyone else) will
be badly impaired, and the effect of any help it does give more than offset,
if old and new trade barriers are allowed to impede a global recovery.
Both issues involve, or should involve, Japan as much as North America and
western Europe. But the Atlantic alliance is much more firmly rooted in a
shared cultural heritage, as well as being embodied in a more solid
institutional framework, than the trilateral relationship - or for that
matter either of the other legs of the triangle taken by itself. The
Atlantic alliance was the backbone of the free world in the cold war. The
best hope for a post-cold war world order worth the name lies in its
continuation, and indeed the gradual extension of its shared values and
procedures, if not its specific institutions, to at least the main
industrial powers of the northern hemisphere.
But continuation cannot mean simply leaving it alone, on the principle of
'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. The alliance in its familiar form was a
direct response to the twin challenges of Soviet military power and what
President Truman called 'the menace of communism as an idea, as an
egalitarian, dynamic social force'. Both are now dead, or at any rate so
diminished that fear of them is no longer enough to hold the western
democracies together. The new challenges facing Europe and North America,
and the reasons why they require a joint effort, need to be clearly
articulated by leaders on both sides of the Atlantic if their peoples are to
make that effort. A common strategy has to be worked out, and the
institutions of the alliance need to be adapted to the new tasks.
On the security side a start has been made, with the creation of the North
Atlantic Co-operation Council (bringing Nato members together with their
former adversaries), and the placing of Nato's resources at the disposal of
the UN for peacekeeping, and perhaps soon for peace enforcement, duties. But
much more needs to be done, above all on the political and economic side
where the EC - soon, let us hope, the European Union - is the proper
interlocutor of the US. Last week's meeting between President Clinton and Mr
Jacques Delors showed that seemingly intractable differences can be
overcome, or at least contained, when political will is applied at the
highest level. The relationship needs much more sustained attention on that
level if it is to flourish.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A new vocation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTURY of failure in Britain's vocational training and education cannot
be quickly reversed. But the next two years should show whether a key
building block of the new system - National Vocational Qualifications - is
helping fill the country's skills deficit or merely giving a fancy new name
to existing arrangements.
If it succeeds it may owe something to the unglamorous sounding National
Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets (Nacett) unveiled last
week. The small committee's high-powered membership, along with the
co-operation shown by rival government departments at its birth, are
promising signs.
NVQs are a critical part of Nacett's remit, aimed at the system's greatest
weakness, namely the large number of young people with no vocational or
educational qualifications. NVQs, which are meant to rationalise a maze of
vocational qualifications, are now available to more than 80 per cent of the
workforce. Based on competence tests rather than written exams, they stretch
from level one (semi-skilled) to level five (higher professional). They are
meant to promote mobility through core transferable skills and improve
comparability both between occupations and between vocational and academic
achievements.
Few people argue with the NVQ principle or with national education and
training targets, in particular the aim that by 1997, 80 per cent of young
people should have reached NVQ level 2 or its academic equivalent of four
higher grade GCSEs. But employers have been slow to sign up their employees
to NVQs, and opinions are strongly divided about the way NVQs are organised.
Critics argue that there is little sign of parity of esteem between academic
and vocational qualifications and that the lack of central authority,
ultimately from Whitehall, has allowed the system to be hijacked by the 126
industry bodies which have designed unacceptably company and job-specific
qualifications, with little emphasis on transferable competences.
For all this, the system is reformable. Nacett's annual report will be a
useful spur. One immediate aim should be to establish reliable figures about
how many people have, or are working towards, NVQs - the figure of 3m quoted
by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications appears to be a guess.
At the same time, the NVQ assessment system could be made less rigid and
expensive. It could also be made easier for people to sub-divide NVQs by
doing a core qualification and then adding more sophisticated options.
The upgrading of vocational qualifications remains in its infancy in
Britain. Education reformers are familiar with the problem of seeing their
work damaged by vested interests. It will take combined determination from
the Education and Employment departments to overcome the difficulties. But
the task is not impossible - the targets must be met.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Not on your life, say insurers: OFT disclosure plans
threaten to revolutionise British insurance practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest insurance
company, loves to tell about the time he paid a sales call on a young woman
policyholder. The woman, needing to look up the details of her policy,
turned to the family bible. And there, on the flyleaf, was the policy number
of every Prudential life insurance product ever owned by a member of her
family.
But now, the traditional relationship between customers and insurers is
coming under attack from Office of Fair Trading proposals for a new
disclosure regime that threatens to revolutionise the way life products are
sold.
Last week, the OFT said proposals by the Securities and Investments Board,
the City's chief watchdog, had 'significant anti-competitive effects' and
did not give prospective customers enough information to help them make wise
choices among products, companies or sales agents. The SIB rules were
intended to replace the current regime under which shoppers learn almost
nothing about how much they pay life insurance companies when they buy a
policy.
Now, the Treasury will examine the OFT report and will order the SIB to
draft another set of rules for the industry if it agrees with the
conclusions.
The OFT proposals will, for the first time, allow Mr Newmarch's favourite
customer to find out before she buys her next policy how much is being
deducted from her premium payments to cover the Pru's costs. Also, she will
learn how much the policy is worth if she surrenders before maturity and, if
she bought the policy through an independent financial adviser, the cash
amount of commission he will earn on the sale.
The question is: will the effect of the additional information be to
discourage the purchase of insurance products generally? And, will it
encourage investors to seek low-cost products - or low-cost sales outlets -
now that shoppers will know roughly how much each product costs?
The Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association, thinks
it knows the answer, but it does not like it. It intends to lobby against
the proposals, saying they will add to the industry's costs and offer few
benefits to consumers.
Mr Tony Baker, ABI director of public affairs, says: 'It will serve to put
people off from buying the product. It will have an unnecessary and unfair
effect on life insurance sales.'
That is the nub of the running battle between regulators and the life
insurance industry since the Financial Services Act went into effect in
1987.
'The FSA was really a watershed,' said Mr Charles Cannon, partner at
consulting actuaries Mercer Fraser. 'It came as a shock to the industry that
life products were even deemed investments.' Mr Cannon notes that for
decades, the life insurance industry had won tax breaks and a favourable
regulatory regime by arguing successfully to parliament that it fulfilled a
social function; that of providing for families after the death of
breadwinners. The companies argued that they collected small bits of money
from many people and invested the sums in British industry.
So attractive were the tax breaks on insurance products and so loose the
regulation that companies piled into the business; there are more than 120
insurance companies operating in Britain. 'Lets face it,' said the chief
executive of one major company, 'these companies just opened the door and
the money poured in.'
In recent years, the insurance business has become exposed as regulators -
and the financial press - came to grips with the heart of the business.
'It is fair to say that the more information which has become available
about life insurance, the less attractive it looks,' Mr Cannon said. Figures
in the OFT's report, for instance, show that by the 20th year of a 25-year
endowment policy, a consumer cancelling the policy will only earn 40 per
cent of its final face value even though 80 per cent of the premiums have
been paid.
A study last year by the SIB found that a quarter to a third of all life and
pensions policies are cancelled within the first two years, a point at which
most customers will receive only a small fraction of premiums paid as a
refund.
Public pressure for regulators to tackle life insurance has become acute.
'For one thing, the average consumer has become much more sophisticated
about financial products,' said Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive of London and
Manchester Group. 'Also, with so many companies in the business, pressure on
sales has been acute.'
For its part, the ABI blames the financial press, which has focused
attention on poor early surrender values and high commissions earned by
sales agents - precisely the information which will become more readily
available under the regime sought by the OFT.
Until now, the life insurance industry has convinced regulators that, unlike
cars and refrigerators, insurance is so complicated it is impossible to tell
shoppers exactly how much they will have to pay for it.
This lack of transparency in price has allowed insurance companies to pass
on their rising costs to consumers with no discernible effect on sales. And
rise they have, according to observers.
Mr Marshall Field, formerly a partner at actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, who
prepared a report on sales commissions for Lautro, the self-regulatory body
for the life insurance industry, points out that there is no lack of
competition in the industry. However, competition has been for sales
outlets, not for consumers. By outbidding each other for sales agents, life
companies found they could increase volumes substantially.
'The industry was not competitive in the true sense until relatively
recently,' said Mr Geoffrey Westall, manager of the European life practice
at consulting actuaries Tillinghast and Co.
More competition under the OFT plan will bring about a restructuring of the
industry and threaten life insurers in several ways. First, prospective
customers will for the first time be able to compare the charges deducted
from their premium payments. 'It will expose the charging structure of
with-profits policies,' said Mr Pyne, explaining that such disclosures would
inhibit the size of commissions that life insurance companies would be able
to offer sales agents. Sales commission is the single biggest ingredient in
the cost of a policy and very few consumers realise they are paying it.
Second, and perhaps even more significant, is the OFT proposal that banks
and building societies, which are the 'tied agents' of life insurers - they
sell the products of one company exclusively - can charge less for the same
product than other sales agents.
Mr Mike Wadsworth, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson said the new
rule was certain to sharpen the competitive edge of so-called bancassurance.
This is assurance sold by banks and building societies through their own
branches to existing customers.
Mr Wadsworth argues that, in any case, life insurers would have had to come
to grips with their distribution costs no matter what happened on the
regulatory front. Competition from banks and European players eager to
exploit the UK market presage a shake-out in any event. 'But regulation has
been the sand in the oyster. Without it, the changes would not have happened
so fast or been so far reaching,' he said. Already, bancassurance is a far
cheaper method of selling policies than the cold-calling approach of
traditional sales agents, he added. The average agent sells a single policy
per week, the average bank-based sales agent sells four.
While bancassurance is currently only 12 per cent of the UK market, Mr
Wadsworth estimates it will be 30 to 50 per cent by the end of the decade.
Thus the OFT, whose goal is fostering competition and protecting consumers,
may be the unwitting instrument of a life insurance revolution.
Banks and building societies will challenge the role of traditional
insurance companies, the long-term endowment policy will become a relic and
companies will be forced to cap sales agents' commissions. In the likely
industry shake-out which follows, the survivors will be those who move most
quickly to fit the new model.

FT  22 MAR 93 / CrossRail off track: Financing a London rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, the chancellor has given the go-ahead for central London's biggest
public transport project since the opening of the Victoria Line in 1968.
From around the turn of the century, people travelling on suburban trains
into British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street terminuses will no
longer have to change to the Underground to reach the West End and the City:
they will stay on their trains and be carried through to their destinations
on CrossRail, a new rail link underneath the capital.
Or will they? More precisely, what the chancellor actually announced in his
Budget speech was that the government was to seek ways of attracting private
finance into the Pounds 2bn project, rather than building it with public
sector money as originally planned.
On the face of it, the idea has some appeal. It is sometimes forgotten that
virtually the whole of London's Underground railway, bar the Victoria Line
and a few extensions, was created by the private sector. A substantial part
of it was built by Charles Tyson Yerkes, a convicted embezzler from Chicago,
who doubled the size of the network with three new lines between 1905 and
1907 and profited handsomely as a result.
The case for building CrossRail is that, like many other big cities, London
suffers from having its railway terminuses on the outskirts of the central
area. The result is that about 200,000 rail commuters a day have to switch
from main line trains to the Underground to get to where they want to go,
putting heavy strains on the system. The problem has worsened with the
outward migration of London's population.
One solution is to join the railway lines on one side of the city with those
on the opposite side, so allowing trains to run right through the centre.
London has already done this in a small way with the Thameslink service,
which uses limited capacity on an old cross-city route to take some suburban
trains through the capital on a north-south axis.
The main obstacle to building new cross-city lines is their cost.
Invariably, they have to go underground, and costs are further increased
because the tunnels and subterranean stations have to be big enough to take
main line trains.
So how were Yerkes and his ilk able to build Underground railways at a
profit? The answer is that labour was cheap in those days, and construction
costs low. Costs were further minimised by digging lines just below surface
level (as with the District and Metropolitan lines) or, in the case of the
deep-level tubes, building very small-diameter tunnels (hence, today's
cramped trains). Further, some companies made substantial property gains
from the development of land adjacent to the surface sections of their
lines. And, significantly, all were able to charge realistic fares because
the absence of motor cars and buses gave them a monopoly on mechanised
transport in the capital.
Things are different today. There are few opportunities for development
gains in a tunnel, so the private sector would have to remunerate its
investment in CrossRail almost entirely by charging train operators tolls
for the use of the link.
The tolls, of course, would have to be recouped by charging passengers
higher fares for going to destinations on the link than for stopping short
of it. But if the price was much higher, passengers would simply disembark
at Paddington or Liverpool Street as now and continue their journeys by
Underground, bus or foot. So CrossRail could find it difficult to charge a
toll high enough to cover its operating costs, still less make a dent in its
financing and construction costs.
It hardly looks a project fit for another Yerkes. But then, perhaps nobody
ever really thought it would be. The cynical view is that, whether or not
the CrossRail bill is revived after Easter, the government is looking for an
excuse to dump the project altogether. Paris, meanwhile, has already
completed three cross-city lines, has a fourth under construction, and is
planning a fifth.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: EC integration has not led to a more protectionist
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDRE SAPIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the EC is the world's largest importer and exporter of merchandise,
even excluding trade among member states. It is therefore befitting that its
commercial policy be subject to close scrutiny. I feel that the recent study
by Prof Winters, as reported by David Marsh ('Single Market Watch: Europe
turns inward', February 22), does not scrutinise adequately.
The study argues that the economic effect of EC integration has been far
less positive than often argued, for two reasons. First, the EC has become
increasingly protectionist. Second, the process of EC integration is
inherently biased toward protectionist outcomes.
However, during the period 1980-91, domestic suppliers' share of the total
of processed products consumed has steadily declined in member states (from
67 to 56 per cent), while the shares supplied by EC partners and non-EC
partners have both risen (from 19 to 25 per cent and 14 to 19 per cent
respectively). This reflects a lowering of the average of external
protection for total processed products, rather than the alleged increase.
The opposite holds, though, for processed agricultural products. Here, the
share of consumption supplied by extra-EC partners has actually declined
(from 7 to 6 per cent), presumably as a result of the Common Agricultural
Policy.
The study's second allegation is that a coalition of states with a common
external trade policy, like the EC, will automatically favour protectionist
outcomes. Prof Winters has clearly in mind the 'fiercely protectionist' CAP.
Although there is no denying that levels of external protection have been
high under the CAP, one cannot be sure that they would have been lower in
the absence of the EC. The example of Switzerland and the Nordic countries,
which protect their agriculture even more than the EC, suggests that the
answer is not as evident as the author would have us believe.
My assessment of the impact of EC integration differs substantially from
that of Prof Winters. While he feels that the EC may have succumbed to the
'danger of becoming inward-looking', I see a process of regional integration
having led to substantial multilateral liberalisation, beyond what could
have happened without the EC. Reinforcement by the EC of its commitment
towards the multilateral trade system is the best way to ensure that
integration will continue to be beneficial to both the EC itself and the
world at large.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Letter: A lesson too frequently ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JONATHAN VIRDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins ('Fast track to efficiency', March 17) illustrates a
general rule for capital projects which is often ignored. This is that it is
necessary to spend about 10 per cent of the total cost of a project before
the main work is done to avoid having to spend an extra 50 per cent or more
to make it work, outside budget and very late.
The difficulty is that 10 per cent of the cost of a big project seems like
an enormous sum to spend without visible result, and is usually cut out of
the plan, especially by those who only have to pay for the project.
With hindsight, and ignoring the effects of long-term inflation, the
Docklands Light Railway project would have spent Pounds 8m to determine that
the original project for Pounds 77m would never work. Whereas Pounds 30m
would have given a good chance of making an excellent system for Pounds
300m, thus saving half of the final cost.
The lesson is that what is certain or uncertain in one culture (engineering)
cannot be easily transmitted to another (finance). But the same mistakes
will be made again, or will public bodies learn?

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Britten Festival begins and ends with innovation -
London premieres of Saxton's Cello Concerto and Dillon's Introitus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Symphony Orchestra's Britten Festival began four weeks ago with a
new work commissioned from Colin Matthews; its final orchestral concert,
conducted by Oliver Knussen at the Barbican on Thursday, included a second
premiere, from Robert Saxton.
Saxton's new Cello Concerto was written expressly for Mstislav Rostropovich,
and its proportions are imposing; it plays continuously for more than 30
minutes and it sets the solo cello against an orchestra that includes triple
brass and a hefty battery of percussion.
The music moves out from a lengthy orchestral introduction, a 'structural
upbeat' in Saxton's terms, through carefully delineated sections which
include a reflective slow movement and a dance-like scherzo back to the
quiet ruminations with which it opened.
The progression from darkness to clarity and back again is typical of
Saxton; he refers to the concerto as being 'programmatic' in an abstract
way, and certainly the very ending has almost a theatrical tension, as the
cello line is left hanging with only a bass pedal to support it.
Otherwise, though, the concerto is dogged rather than dramatic and it is
difficult not to feel that Saxton has missed a precious opportunity.
There are few more committed musical advocates than Rostropovich, whatever
the cause, yet Saxton set him a thankless task: too much of the concerto
condemns the soloist to busy figuration, as the thematic material is put
routinely through its paces.
The ideas are never vivid enough, nor the interplay between the cello and
the orchestra sufficiently striking; what could have a luminous, intense
work, given the auspicious circumstances, turned out to be a grey,
undistinguished one.
James Dillon's Introitus, introduced to Britain at St Giles, Cripplegate on
Friday by Music Projects/London under Richard Bernas, scarcely set the pulse
racing any faster. It is the latest instalment of the Nine Rivers cycle
which has preoccupied Dillon since 1982, and by a long way the most
ambitious to date.
Planned as the eighth segment in the finished sequence (with the third,
fifth and ninth still to be completed), Introitus was first performed at
IRCAM in Paris three years ago: an ensemble of 12 strings is embedded in a
web of computer-generated taped sound and electronic transformations which
envelops both listeners and performers, creating what Dillon hopes is 'a
tidal delirium opened up by the employment of computer technology'.
The programme note painstakingly details the sources of the tape (from the
string instruments themselves to the sound of cicadas and the periodicity of
pulsars) and the digital techniques that were applied to them.
For the most part, however, the sound is homogenised into a continuum
through which the instrumental sounds, live and treated, only emerge
vaguely.
The total effect is generally far too amorphous; the telling moments towards
the end of the 30-minute piece, appearing almost anecdotal in this context,
arrive too late to lift what comes across as a forbidding and unrewarding
experience.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Eldar Nebolsin's encores redeem a lost hour - An
impressive performance by the young Russian pianist and Grand Prizewinner of
the Santander competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All unawares, I reached the Wigmore Hall on Friday evening just in time for
the interval; my newly repaired watch had somehow mislaid an hour during the
afternoon. It was frustrating to hear such excited reports of what young
Nebolsin had been doing with Liszt's 'Dante' Sonata, and with Beethoven's
op. 31 no. 3. Fortunately, there was enough meat in the second half of his
programme to stretch him again: the excited reports proved to be entirely in
order, and I was sorrier still to have missed his 'Dante'.
Nebolsin was born in 1974, like the prodigious Siberian violinist Maxim
Vengerov, and in a still more exotic corner of Russia ' Tashkent, where he
pursued his studies until only a year and a half ago. He works now with the
teacher Dimitri Bashkirov in Madrid, and last year he was Grand Prizewinner
at the Santander competition. The continuing westward stream of precocious
Russian artists, whose difficult times at home are driving them abroad, must
be discouraging for their Western coevals.
How do those 'provincial' Russian music-schools contrive at once to polish
their budding solo performers to a dazzling virtuoso gloss, to instil in
them a firm respect for period manners, and yet to leave their communicative
energy and imagination untrammelled? European conservatoires hardly ever
manage that: with their products, between lusty individual attack and
revealing musicianship it's usually one or the other.
Still a somewhat gangly adolescent, Nebolsin springs at the piano like an
instinctive performing animal. His technique is brilliantly articulated,
with a bias toward the feral pounce and sharp clang of Horowitz's style.
Everything he does is alight with feeling. Here, in Chopin's B minor Sonata,
the Scherzo and Finale glittered to urgent purpose; the languorous,
visionary byways of the opening movement weren't indulged (Nebolsin's range
doesn't run so far yet), but given crisp up-tempo treatment as moments
within the overall form.
All of it was bracing to hear, electric with conviction. In a couple of the
Chopin Mazurkas, he captured just the second-beat-in-the-bar mazurka-lift
that we missed last week in Marc Laforet's. (For want of it, as I wrote
then, his came rather near to sounding like French valses.).
In Sofia Gubaidulina's 1962 Chacon, forming her first bold 'serial'
exercise, Nebolsin's address was forceful, lean and linear where two weeks
ago Andreas Haefliger had conjured up warm, suggestive hazes from the
residual hints of tonality.
For encores it was no surprise that the young Russian should choose
extrovert, heart-on-sleeve Rakhmaninov; nor that he should deliver it with
such resounding fervour. Some scatterings of wrong notes were forgivable and
forgettable; with Nebolsin they amounted to mere flecks upon a palpably
vital current.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Orpheus in the Underworld - D'Oyly Carte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR JACOBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's cross-Channel leap from Gilbert and
Sullivan to Offenbach has been sympathetically awaited. Orpheus in the
Underworld is announced as a first step in a broadening of the company's
repertory of light opera. It comes as a co-production with Opera North,
sharing the same designer (Tim Hatley) and director (Martin Duncan) but with
D'Oyly Carte's own musical director, the capable John Owen Edwards, and with
a cast largely overlapping with that of the companion-piece for the current
national tour, The Pirates of Penzance.
To complain of timidity in the choice, on the ground that Orpheus in the
Underworld is the most familiar of the dozens of works in Offenbach's
output, is probably to miss the point. The ceaseless musical fizz of this
score plus the ready opportunity for guying the gods of Olympus mean that
the piece can hardly fail. The same assurance can be given with the D'Oyly
Carte version, even though it is really Orpheus in the Recession. It is not
merely miserly of scenery and effects, with tatty, ill-fitting costumes; its
poverty is also the poverty of imagination. The staging manages to be both
congested and over-symmetrical; elbow-jigging and bum-shaking are passed off
as dancing.
David Fieldsend zombies through the role of Orpheus, his persistently faulty
miming of the solo violin part hardly credible in a music-based company. His
spoken lines are delivered in a nondescriptly northern accent (why do
directors suppose, as Ken Russell did with the ENO's Princess Ida, that
regional dialect is funny in itself, however unmotivated?). At Birmingham
last Thursday, most of the characters seemed not so much to be playing their
roles as playing at them - the outstanding exceptions being Barry Patterson,
a tall, dashing devil of a Pluto; Gareth Jones, with just the right pathetic
and comic touch as Pluto's servant, John Styx; and Jill Pert, whose
self-righteous but nimble-footed incarnation as Public Opinion would have
done honour to Patricia Routledge.
Moving down from Mount Olympus to Pluto's dominions, the second act showed
some improvement. Mutual sparks began to fly between the pretty,
sweet-voiced Eurydice of Mary Hegarty and the rather dry-toned Jupiter of
Alan Watt. Here the smart new translation by Jeremy Sams was to be relished,
though I maintain that Geoffrey Dunn's former translation was smarter still.
Finally, of course, the can-can - or rather can't-can't. If the expectation
of Parisian flavour would have been unreasonable, some comparable
inventiveness was needed. But things just bumped along - a verdict which has
to be applied to too much of this shortish evening.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Fabbricini's Tosca - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The soprano who brought La traviata back to Milan three years ago after a
generation's gap was Tiziana Fabbricini, a petite Italian discovered and
moulded by Riccardo Muti. Since that triumph, far from flying round the
world on Muti's coat-tails, we have heard very little of her - unlike her
Alfredo, Roberto Alagna, who made a much-approved Covent Garden debut last
season. In the past two months, however, Fabbricini has finally begun to
spread her wings, allowing audiences in Berlin and New York to hear her
Violetta.
The Deutsche Staatsoper in east Berlin also engaged her to sing Tosca, which
gave her the chance to prove she is more than a one-role singer. There must
have been many like myself who questioned whether Puccini's doughty heroine
was the right step forward. In the event, the doubts were swept aside.
Fabbricini is the opposite of the Valkyrie breed of Tosca currently
prevalent - fragile and feminine, young enough to be naive and impulsive,
subtle in her body language instead of relying on Verona-size brush-strokes.
She may miss the glamorous hauteur of the prima donna, but she has an
authentic stage personality, dramatic and vulnerable. And the way she allows
jealousy, romantic passion and anger to flare in quick succession underlines
that Tosca is a woman with Latin blood coursing through her veins.
The more refined Italian instincts are to be found in her natural projection
of words, grace notes and melodic line. She produces remarkable volume for
such a small frame, but never volume for the sake of it. The voice itself is
very much a matter of taste, which is why Fabbricini is unlikely to make a
big recording career: you have to see her to appreciate her. The timbre is
not conventionally beautiful. When not in full flood it has a brittle
quality that can sound dangerously close to parlando. Yet even in such
moments she communicates genuine emotion.
Her Cavaradossi was another up-and-coming singer who has yet to make an
impact in London - the Latvian tenor Sergey Larin. As befits someone who has
already sung Don Carlo at La Scala, he shows good vocal manners, bringing a
handsome, even ring to the arias. He also looks presentable, despite some
unimaginative acting. Sherrill Milnes, one of his increasingly rare visits
to Europe, brought a sense of patrician menace to Scarpia, one of his
best-known parts - though the vocal colour is beginning to fade.
With three such well-matched principals, Tosca recaptures some of the
magnetism we all recall from our first encounter with it. The Staatsoper
staging, first produced in German in 1976, provided a glimpse of
pre-Barenboim days - simple and serviceable, with strong comprimario
singing. The conductor, Eugene Kohn, was about two bars behind everyone
else, but the Staatskapelle (on automatic pilot) played well.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Gothic preserved - The case for sympathetic building
and restoration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It often seems to me that architecture is sometimes taken much too
seriously. Sides are taken and battle lines are drawn in a fashion that
often looks ridiculous to anyone outside the profession. Do you really care
whether or not a design is modern, post-modern, gothic or classical? What
matters is whether or not the design is good. One of the subjects that
currently arouses ire and passion in equal doses in the breasts of
architects is the future of the damaged wing of Windsor Castle.
That esteemed organ, Country Life, which now seems to be all set under its
new editorial team to become the journal of imagination when it comes to
architectural and environmental issues, has just launched an important
international competition for designs for the rebuilding of the fire-damaged
areas of Windsor Castle. The reason for mentioning this in this column is
principally because it is open to anyone - artists, interior designers, 'and
anyone else who feels qualified to comment'. This sounds a brilliant idea
because there are many of us who have maintained for a long time that
architects do not necessarily have the monopoly of architectural ideas.
The other reason why the Windsor competition could be very important
(although impossible to judge) is that it may concentrate minds on the
debate about the appropriate way to treat historic buildings. The only
problem with this competition is the nature of the jury. For some reason,
presumably to excite international interest, Country Life seems to have lost
its traditional nerve and gone for trendy names on its jury - as well as
some deadbeat modernists who are known to be deeply prejudiced against
history itself. But far be it from a mere architecture critic to put anyone
off entering a competition because of the composition of the jury. After
all, this competition does deal with a fascinating and important
architectural problem. The key thing to remember is that it is open to
anyone.
The competition brief is available from Country Life Windsor Castle
Competition, Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 2EH. Telephone: 0344 890080.
There is an entry fee of Pounds 10 and a very modest prize of Pounds 1000.
The closing date is June 10.
The Architecture Foundation is another ginger group that is keen to get on
the Windsor Castle bandwagon. It has commissioned several practising
architects, mainly but not entirely of a modernist persuasion, to come up
with a new design for the interior of the damaged St. George's Hall. These
will be exhibited shortly at the Architecture Foundation and published in a
forthcoming book about Windsor Castle by Dr Mark Girouard.
When it comes to architectural tradition there always has been a
comparatively unsung group of architects and craftsmen in England quietly
working away building and designing things that are usually ignored by the
architectural press. What these unsung heroes generally achieve is very
happy clients and plenty of work. They are free of the vagaries of fashion
and mercifully outside the intense and often meaningless international
debate. One of these architects is Roderick Gradidge, who has recently
completed an ingenious scheme for St. Edmund's College, Cambridge.
The college is situated on Mount Pleasant - the part of Cambridge that marks
the commencement of the line of new colleges that proceed to the west of the
city. It was founded as St. Edmund's House by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in
1896 as a residence for Roman Catholic clergy studying for degrees. Since
1965 the college has been an approved graduate college and now has some 150
students from 30 countries. The early gabled red brick, turn of the century
buildings are without any particular distinction and to unify and extend
them was a not inconsiderable challenge for the architect. For a long time
Gradidge has taken a pioneering interest in the history of Edwardian
architecture - his work at the National Portrait Gallery in London and his
more recent restoration of the Guildhall at Northampton shows a
knowledgeable enthusiasm for Edwardian and Gothic interiors.
At Cambridge Gradidge had little opportunity to provide decorative
interiors. Instead he has designed a striking brick tower some six storeys
high to mark the entrance to the college. At the top of this tower is the
Okinaga Room, named after the benefactor (Dr S. Okinaga the President of
Teikyo University, Japan). This is the highest room in Cambridge and has
remarkable views over the whole city. The style of the tower has been
described by the architect as 'streamlined Tudor'. It is built of buff brick
with a slate roof and has some well carved heraldry in the brickwork (by
Richard Kindersley). The tower has succeeded in centering the plan of the
college, giving it a prominent entrance and literally raising its profile in
Cambridge. Gradidge worked throughout the scheme with the Charter
Partnership.
Shades of Tudor and Gothic revivals are clearly in the air with attention
focused on the fate of the unrepaired Albert Memorial in London's Kensington
Gardens, which is now a neglected victim of government parsimony. There is
an argument for putting Albert into a glass case but a public appeal for
funds looks more likely. That will be a real test of the national enthusiasm
for the Gothic - and the recent news that passengers from the Channel Tunnel
trains are now going to arrive at St. Pancras gives Railway Gothic a sudden
international dimension.
I would like to see architect Michael Hopkins put in charge of the
replanning of the station, as he has the rare skill of understanding and
adding to the past without any hint of nostalgia or pastiche. He would also
provide ample evidence to our visitors from Europe that although we love the
Gothic we are not totally smothered by Gothic gloom. Next year's exhibition
at the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted to the life and work of Pugin will
show once and for all how Gothic architecture and design can marry
structural ingenuity with colour and decoration in a way that many
contemporary architects still find difficult to contemplate, let alone
achieve.

<TEXT>
There will surely be tears before bedtime in September Song (8.00 ITV) not
least because this half-hour drama serial is described as 'bittersweet'.
Ted, who cared for his wife until she died of MS, is pretty clearly falling
for Roxy, the stripper with a heart of gold and a charming daughter. Roxy
may admire Ted's decency and education, but will she reciprocate the love? I
fear not, or we would be left without a plot. Dear old Horizon seriously
imagines that the Dead Sea Scrolls 'could radically alter what Christians
and Jews have believed for almost 2,000 years'. They may alter what
historians or scientists believe, but where religion is concerned the power
of myth seems to work in inverse proportion to the facts. The programme
visits the site of the discovery of the scrolls and examines the evidence
(8.00 BBC2). In Anthem For Doomed Youth Kenneth Branagh reads from the war
poems and letters of Wilfred Owen (9.25 Radio 3); and in A Book At Bedtime
John Hurt begins 'The Inseparable Twins' by Anatoly Pristavkin (10.45 Radio
4).

FT  22 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 35m orders awarded to Try
Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRY CONSTRUCTION and TRY BUILD, members of the Try Group, have been awarded
contracts totalling Pounds 35m.
More than 60 per cent of the group's workload has been secured by
negotiation or has arisen as novations from the receivers of failed
contractors. The recent acquisitions of AF Budge Building and CBM
Construction in Yorkshire alone have given Try Pounds 20m of work.
Try Construction has secured contracts totalling Pounds 19m which include
the negotiated fit out of offices for a major petrochemical company in
Sunbury worth Pounds 3.82m.
Try Build has contracts worth Pounds 15.6m which include a Pounds 1.1m
community centre at Slough for Berkshire County Council and an extension to
Bishop Challenor School (Pounds 630,000) for the Diocese of Westminster
Trustees.

FT  22 MAR 93 / People: Credit Lyonnais' Menard says 'Oui' to Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Menard, a 25 year veteran of Credit Lyonnais, is leaving in June
to join Barclays Bank as head of the French operation. He replaces Jacques
Rambosson, director of European corporate banking, who moved to London in
December. Since then, Carlos Martinez de Campos, director of retail banking
in Europe, has been temporarily filling the position.
During a peripatetic career at CL, Menard has lived in Portugal and Brazil,
and had two stints in London. He spent four years as managing director of
Credit Lyonnais Capital Markets and is credited with returning the UK
securities operation to profit after several years of losses following the
French bank's ill-timed acquisition of Alexanders Laing &amp; Cruickshank in
1987. At the beginning of 1992, Menard, 51, returned to head office; he is
currently 'directeur central' in charge of the branch network. He was not
prepared to comment on his move.
Barclays, which employs over 2,500 people in France as a whole, has recently
been expanding its retail network. It has added twenty branches in the past
few months in the Paris region, and plans to open another 20 before the end
of the year, bringing the total to 90. The bank also caused a stir among the
French banking community last autumn with an attempt to get around the ban
on interest-bearing current accounts, and, despite further government
prohibitions, it has already found 10,000 customers for a modified product.

<TEXT>
SANTE TRADING, based in Cyprus, and ACER CONSULTANTS, engineering and
management consultants, have been commissioned by Iran's Qeshm Free
Authority to finance, develop, design and build the Gulf Bridge in Iran's
Qeshm Island.
The Gulf Bridge will be a 2.5km road and rail bridge linking Iran's main
land to the Qeshm Island. Sante will be acting as the financiers and
developers for the project, which is estimated to cost USDollars 100m
(Pounds 69m). The Middle East Trading Co, based in the Isle of Man, has
already been appointed as financial consultants and Sante is currently
negotiating with Bank Saderat, Tehran, Iran, to also appoint them as joint
financial consultants for this project.
Acer is the design and build project manager and full design consultant for
the project. Four European contractors have been invited by Sante and Acer
to take part in the project and interviews are currently being held. An
Iranian contractor will also be appointed to work in joint venture with the
selected European contractor.
Sante and Acer have already received the letter of intent for the project
and the feasibility study is expected to begin in September.
It is estimated that the Gulf Bridge will take three years to complete from
start to finish.
Iran intends to convert Qeshm Island, which is about three times the size of
Singapore and almost the size of Cyprus, into the commercial and tourist
heart of the Gulf.
Schemes for the island are already under way including; commercial buildings
and housing developments; power generation and supply; and over 250,000
trees planted.

FT  22 MAR 93 / People: BP clips senior executives' wings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less flying and more decision-making seems to be the main purpose of the
latest top management reshuffle at BP. Rodney Chase and Hugh Norton, BP's
two regional managing directors who have been based overseas in Cleveland
and Singapore, are being brought back to BP's group headquarters in London.
Rodney Chase, 49, who took over as chairman and chief executive of BP
America a year ago, will remain chairman of BP America and retain group
responsibility for the Western hemisphere. Hugh Norton, 56, who was sent out
to Singapore less than two years ago as part of an upgrading of BP's
presence in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, will retain his
responsibilities for these areas. But he will be based in London from July
and Chase will return from the US in the second half of the year.
David Simon, who took over as BP's chief executive after the ousting of Bob
Horton in June, says that the moves 'complete the co-location of BP's
businesses and regional managing directors in one centre and will enable the
executive team to extend and integrate its work programmes more closely.'
Given that both men are supposed to put in appearances at the regular
managing directors' meetings, it meant they spent a considerable amount of
their time either flying to London or missing meetings.
Although BP portrays the latest upheavals as a routine reorganisation, it
means that BP America will have had its third chief executive in less than
two years. Chase replaced James Ross, who left to be chief executive of
Cable &amp; Wireless, and Chase is now being replaced as chief executive of BP
America by Chuck Bowman, who has headed BP Australia for the last three
years. Bowman takes up his new post at the beginning of 1994. He in turn
will be replaced by fellow American Ron McGimpsey, currently chief financial
officer and senior vice president of BP America.
Les Atkinson, general manager of BP Oil, succeeds Norton as regional
director Asia Pacific, also becoming chief executive BP Oil, S E Asia.

FT  22 MAR 93 / People: Scotia's new chairman?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, who steps down as director general of the Office of Gas
Supply in September, could soon be leading a small but glamorous
pharmaceutical company on to the stock market.
He has been made deputy chairman of Scotia Holdings, the research-based drug
company, which expects to float its shares within the next year or so. Sir
James, 63, was also made deputy chairman of financial services and media
group MAI last week.
MAI, like Scotia, is headed by Sir Ian Morrow. The two men know each other
from their days when they were presidents of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in Scotland. Given that Sir Ian is now over 80, it is thought he
will hand over the chairmanship of MAI and Scotia to Sir James.
Although Scotia only had a turnover of Pounds 16m in the year to last June
it has spent over Pounds 32m on pharmaceutical research and development
since it was founded by its chief executive Dr David Horrobin. In order to
continue its heavy spending in this area, the company is keen to get its
shares fully listed on the stock market.
Apart from recruiting Sir James McKinnon, there are a number of other
well-known names on Scotia's board of directors including James McAdam,
chairman of Ratners, and William Glynn-William, deputy managing director of
Glaxo Pharmaceuticals UK.
To pave the way for its stock market float, Scotia has hired Kleinwort
Benson as its merchant bank and Hoare Govett as broker. The company is owned
by a couple of venture capital funds, Dr Horrobin's family and about 200
shareholders. The shares are traded in a small way under rule 535. On the
basis of the last price of Pounds 7.80, the company is valued at around
Pounds 180m.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Management: Tighter rein on the treasury - Even blue-chip
companies have suffered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of employees dabbles on the foreign exchange futures market, betting
on a rise in the dollar. The dollar then falls and they cover their tracks.
Four years later they are discovered sitting on an unrealised loss of
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m).
The story sounds improbable. Yet it can happen to the most blue-chip of
companies, as Shell found out when its Japanese associate, Showa Shell,
disclosed such a loss last month.
It is not just unauthorised dealings that can land companies in trouble.
George Wimpey, the housebuilder, last week announced a Pounds 25m provision
against the cost of unwinding interest rate futures contracts. About five
years ago, the builder had bet on interest rates remaining high; the
subsequent fall in rates has made it cancel its bet  - at a heavy cost.
The scale of potential damage a treasury department can inflict on the
profit line has made top management take notice. Big shareholders are taking
an increasing interest too. They are not just worried about the scope for
losses when controls break down - as was the case at Showa Shell - but about
losses when companies take a view and get it wrong.
The Association of Corporate Treasurers has recently published a booklet of
awkward questions that investors and analysts can put to companies to
understand their exposure.
Pressure from shareholders, coupled with the growing list of corporate
horror stories, is encouraging companies to build a structure of controls
around their treasury departments. 'In the past, boards used to let the
treasurer get on with it. They used to look at the treasury as a black box,
yet now more companies are introducing policies and procedures,' says Nick
Ross, partner of accountant Touche Ross.
The first step is for the board to come out with a clear set of rules.
'Companies must ask themselves what level of risk they are happy with,' says
Gerald Leahy, head of the Association of Corporate Treasurers. They should
then issue a policy statement approved by the main board, making it clear to
what extent the company hedges against movements in interest and exchange
rates.
The statement should lay down the objectives of the treasury department and
provide lists of dealing limits in each sort of instrument, saying who can
deal and in what amount.
This sort of exercise seems to have focused the minds of companies and made
them increasingly wary of taking any unnecessary risks.
'We never expose ourselves to unlimited risks, we always know what the
downside is. If I want to do anything fancy, I need to get approval for it.
But usually, I just stick to plain vanilla,' says the treasurer of an FT-SE
100 company.
Only about 7 per cent of big companies run their treasury as a profit
centre, and some companies are abolishing their central treasuries, passing
the duties down the line to the operational level, where all exposures are
mechanically covered as they arise.
The whizzy financial deals that companies happily engaged in during the
1980s are becoming less common. 'We are saying to directors: 'If you don't
understand it, say no',' says Leahy.
A policy statement alone is not going to ensure that things run smoothly in
the treasury. It is almost impossible to prevent someone from doing an
unauthorised deal, but companies can at least ensure that such trades are
quickly spotted.
To this end, the person who does the trade should not be the same as the one
who confirms it, nor the one that settles it. However, this rudimentary
control is not followed by a large number of companies: according to Touche
Ross, many of the top 250 UK companies do not separate their activities in
this way.
Companies should then set up accounting systems to measure how well the
treasury department is doing and keep senior management abreast of what is
going on. They should also issue to someone outside the department a regular
report of all transactions.
Once again, companies do not seem to be following best practice. According
to Touche Ross, almost half do not revalue their positions regularly, which
means that they may be sitting on losses or profits without being aware of
it.
However, these sort of controls are not likely to work unless the culture of
the company discourages taking unacceptable risks.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar company, has gone to some lengths to ensure that it
is not in the interests of its 14-person treasury team to do anything
untoward. Its incentives are structured so that there are no individual
bonuses; and although the department as a whole may get a bonus, this is
only loosely tied to its trading performance.
The company claims the virtue of intellectual honesty is drummed into its
traders, all of whom are trained in-house. Furthermore, all employees are
encouraged to confess immediately if they make a mistake.
Technology is also helping companies introduce better controls. At Tate &amp;
Lyle, all telephone calls to the banks are recorded - a system that a few
years ago would have cost some Pounds 30,000, but now can be had for a sixth
of the price.
Similarly, advances in computer technology are making it possible to revalue
trading positions more frequently, so that the management of big companies
will constantly be able to know where they stand at the touch of a button.
Naturally, the systems appropriate to a big trading company are not
necessary in a little company with a treasury of one person, yet the
principles are the same.
Controls are all very well, but there is a danger that companies can get
fixated on the controls, rather than watch the intrinsic risks of what they
are doing.
Says Leahy: 'Auditors are putting more and more controls in, so that
companies can kid themselves that with so many controls all is OK. But
management have to think what sort of business they are in, and stick to
their last.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / Management: A dogged all-rounder - Sir Owen Green, the
outgoing head of BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the secret of management is timing, Sir Owen Green has it to perfection.
Ten days ago he announced his retirement from BTR, the company he founded.
He also announced that BTR's profits had passed Pounds 1bn for the first
time. The share price rose to new heights, valuing BTR at Pounds 12bn. This
made it Britain's seventh biggest company, handsomely ahead of Guinness, ICI
and J. Sainsbury and a nose ahead of its rival conglomerate Hanson.
But BTR is in another sense deeply out of fashion. As a conglomerate, it
lacks focus. On the day of Sir Owen's announcement came the news that
Glaxo's chief executive had been ousted, largely because he believed -
unlike his chairman - that the company's focus should be broader. A few
weeks earlier, ICI's chairman had said he was finally persuaded the
conglomerate concept was finished and focus was everything. ICI would
therefore split itself in two.
Unsurprisingly, Sir Owen has no truck with any of this. 'If you're trained
in the techniques of management, you ought to be able to apply them across
an unlimited area of activity. There have been disasters when organisations
have outgrown their strengths and talents. But that's because their reach
was further than their grasp. It's another thing to preach that being
diversified is a weakness.'
Then again, ICI's decision was based on more than size. The company had come
to realise that the technical complexity of its operations meant no
individual understood them all. No-one was properly equipped to choose
between investment proposals ranging from seed breeding to chlorine
manufacture.
'I suggest that's because they must specialise to too high a point in their
organisation', Sir Owen says. 'There ought to be a level at which special
knowledge can be translated into more general terms. If it can't, I don't
know what a board of directors is for. I'd reject the view that a business
could ever be so technically specialised that an informed decision could not
be made by a trained management.'
The key to BTR, says Sir Owen, is not focus but contiguity: moving into
areas next door. 'To start with, we looked for contiguity in manufacturing
processes, particularly in rubber. But a common feature of the market was
the automobile industry, so we started making acquisitions related not to
rubber but to autos. So we got into contiguity of markets.'
Underlying that was an absolute commitment to growth, whether organic or by
acquisition. In the ecologically conscious world of the late 1990s, this
might seem unfashionable as well.
Sir Owen is unrepentant.
'The human condition seeks to better itself, whether materially or
intellectually. And the most exciting period of life is one's teens. During
those years, tremendous things are happening physiologically. If you can
somehow capture that excitement and freshness in an organisation, you've got
something. That's what I mean by growth. It isn't acquisitiveness, or size,
or being in the top 10 in the beauty parade. It's the vivacity it gives to
life in the company.'
But must not a company eventually age, like the human organism? 'The fact is
we have continued to grow. In percentage terms it's been declining, but it's
still there. There must come a time when you can't acquire and you become
unmanageable, but I don't know when. I don't think it would come through
internal limitations. Internally, our system of management -
decentralisation held together by financial control - is capable of any
amount of expansion'.
There is another heresy behind this. Governments in the developed world,
from Tokyo to Brussels, agonise over the growth industries of the future,
such as information technology and biotechnology. Sir Owen is happy to be in
none of them. 'We're hewers of wood and drawers of water. It isn't the
nature of any of our businesses to take a very long view technologically. I
can't see anywhere where pure research funded by us would benefit either us
or society.'
Surely this risks being left behind in a changing world? Not if you pick
your areas, says Sir Owen. 'In 10 years' time, an automobile will still have
wheels and suspension. In packaging, the concept of wrapping things up will
still be there, whether you're talking about paper or boxes or cartons or
bottles. Or take the creation of electrical energy. It's been going for 150
years, and it's probably good for another 150. Or take valves. As long as
you're going to conduct fluids, you're going to need valves. You get steady
improvements in ways of shutting things off and turning them on, but nothing
particularly revolutionary.'
Pursuing his view of the world in 10 years' time, where does he think the UK
will stand as a manufacturing base? 'If Europe maintains a commonality of
markets, I think the UK could be more important as a manufacturing centre
than it is today. That's provided we don't tie ourselves to a fixed monetary
system, or commit ourselves to the Social Chapter.
'If I compare the productivity of our German operations with our British
ones, I don't detect the advantage Germany's said to have. When you come to
actual cost, clearly the UK has the advantage. And we still have the skills.
I see no reason for us to try to force through a greater concentration on
engineering, though it would be nice if we could re-establish the regard for
technologists we had in the 19th century.'
There is a final, classic question to ask an eminent industrialist on his
retirement. What advice would he give to an aspiring young UK manufacturer
today?
'You have to have a product. What you should then do, more than has been
done in a good many years, is get around the world. My impression is that
the large economies are more willing to buy from any source than they used
to be. In the US, for example, there are tremendous opportunities for anyone
who has a product. For the UK manufacturer, the important thing is that the
world is your oyster. Your total capacity is tiny in relation to the
available market.'
And could he suggest a product? 'No, I couldn't. Wisdom and sagacity are
things you only get with age, so their application has drawbacks. You're
bound to be constrained by your own experience of setbacks. You'd fail to
recognise the vital, energising stream of possibilities that young people
can see. Wisdom and sagacity would rule out half of them.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / Deficiencies in technical skill teaching seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TECHNOLOGY syllabus used in English schools is much less effective in
preparing pupils for industry's needs than equivalent courses in other
European countries, a report published today by the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research says.
The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research
fellow - say practical subjects taught in schools can lay the foundation for
vocational training and the acquisition of industrial skills.
Schools in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands use practical subjects
such as woodwork, technical drawing and domestic science to instil basic
work skills. These include care, precision, perseverance and responsibility.
In England teaching of these subjects has been replaced with the technology
syllabus of the national curriculum. The report says this syllabus places
strong emphasis on creativity and imagination at the expense of basic
skills. The English syllabus devotes much of the pupil's time to speculating
and writing about a general theme, the report says. In the European
countries studied, school time was largely devoted to the making of useful
objects working from precise drawings.
Earlier studies by the institute have shown that the shortage of craft
skills is the principal deficiency of British industry when compared with
European competitors.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Rivals clash over Bristol's airspace: How BAe's plan to
develop its Filton airfield has met with opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS all the ingredients of a classic dogfight, with thousands of workers
and residents caught in the crossfire.
To the north of Bristol, British Aerospace intends to develop its Filton
airfield, once the proving ground for Concorde, as a commercial airport. To
the south, determined to defend its identity, is the existing Bristol
airport, owned by Labour-controlled Bristol City Council.
Filton, once an RAF station, has several advantages. Its runway is longer
and it is close to the city centre, the M4 and M5 and the Severn Bridge.
Bristol's existing airport at Lulsgate, where traffic is increasing rapidly,
is reached down a winding country road.
BAe and its supporters are scornful of local opposition to its ambitious
plans for Filton. 'It is only the old lady and her dog against it,' says Mr
Malcolm Ginsberg of Air Bristol, which wants to start scheduled flights from
Filton in direct competition to Lulsgate.
The issues at stake are not simply those of rivalry. BAe has obtained a
commercial licence for Filton from the Civil Aviation Authority and believes
it does not need planning permission for a change of use from the present
mixture of business operations. 'We have this licence and we are simply
enacting it,' Mr Ian Woodward, a BAe official, says. 'We are not seeking to
be devious nor to upset our neighbours.'
BAe's stance has caused the district council, Northavon, to reach for a
lawyer. It has caused Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general and a local MP,
to express concern and antagonised another local Conservative MP, Mr Michael
Stern.
The presence of a new town on the eastern side of the airfield makes the
dispute more controversial.
Four thousand houses have been built there creating the new town of Bradley
Stoke, which is scheduled to double in size by 2000. Bradley Stoke
advertises itself as 'a new community environment'. Presumably this does not
mean it could be under the approach path of a regional airport.
There are powerful groups in both camps. BAe has the backing of its unions
in making best use of its airfield to protect the future of Filton, where
the work includes Airbus. It has the tacit support of Rolls-Royce at its
neighbouring Patchway plant. In recent years thousands of jobs have been
lost at the two sites. Only this month Rolls-Royce announced that a further
1,400 jobs would go at Patchway.
BAe says the airfield costs Pounds 1m a year to run and, with work at Filton
declining, the plant's future could be jeopardised unless more use is made
of it. Under its plans, commercial flights would be limited to freight and
scheduled services with its 'whisper' jet, the BAe 146.
Air Bristol, a fledgling airline which is about to apply for an operator's
licence, wants to lease BAe 146 jets and start scheduled services by late
spring.
Meanwhile Mr Les Wilson, managing director of Bristol airport, says the city
cannot afford two airports. 'There is no city in Europe which is not a
capital which has two airports.'
Lulsgate's viability is being threatened just when it is embarking on a
Pounds 50m 10-year development programme for which it is seeking private
finance that could entail some form of privatisation. Northavon council says
it has been 'inundated' with letters protesting about the Filton plan. Its
legal advice over whether fresh planning consent is required is that the
position is not clear cut. It is to meet BAe this week.
BAe gained its commercial licence as long ago as 1988 but nobody outside the
aviation industry seems to have noticed. In awarding a licence, the CAA
states it is only concerned with safety and not with the environment. Sir
John Cope, MP for Northavon, says local people fear that Filton might start
with modest proposals but become a full regional airport in five or 10
years.
Mr Stern hopes Northavon will decide that fresh planning consent is
required. He is prepared to challenge that in the courts if it does not. He
says BAe has gone back on assurances that it had no plans for commercial
use.
More opposition comes from Mr Tom Hood, marketing manager of Bradley Stoke
Consortium, a roll call of builders from Beazer to Wimpey which hold large
parcels of as yet undeveloped land. 'I believe it is morally wrong. If you
want to bring in an extra 350,000 passengers a year to an airport then you
should get planning permission.'
In contrast Mr Ginsberg says a successful regional airport would even put
value on the houses near the airport. He dismisses the environmental
protests. 'The BAe 146 doesn't make any noise,' he says. 'There is a
groundswell of local opinion which is very firmly in favour of Filton.' He
argues that the airports could be complementary, with Filton having the
scheduled services and Lulsgate the charter flights.
The furore over Filton comes as traffic at Lulsgate is running at 1m
passengers a year. The airport's priority is a new Pounds 14m terminal but
its construction is delayed - ironically by planning requirements.
The local district council, Woodspring, has set conditions which the airport
is resisting. There will be a public inquiry in May.
If BAe does succeed in its plans, the new Lulsgate terminal may be
redundant.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Change to national curriculum urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL CHANGES are needed to the national curriculum if the government's
educational reforms are not to fail, a pamphlet published today by the
rightwing Centre for Policy Studies says.
The centre was responsible for shaping much of the reform programme.
The pamphlet says the national curriculum has become too prescriptive and
should be limited to essentials. It should not occupy more than half the
school day, nor should it cover more than half the time allotted to any
subject.
The pamphlet also calls for testing to be simplified. Short, simple, pencil
and paper tests are more objective, cheaper and less time-consuming for
teachers, the centre says.
The pamphlet is published amid growing concern among Conservative education
thinkers about the progress of the government's education reforms.
Written by Professor Anthony O'Hear, a leading government adviser on
education, the pamphlet says that raising standards requires greater choice
and diversity in schools.
Prof O'Hear echoes widespread concern about the forms of compulsory testing
introduced for all children at 7, 11 and 14. Simplifying the tests and
increasing their rigour should be a priority for the new School Curriculum
and Assessment Authority, he says.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Securities professionals face exam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London's newest professional body, the Securities Institute, is
urging potential members to beat a March 31 deadline and escape a nine-hour
examination ordeal.
Membership will be much easier while the 'window of opportunity' remains
open. Until Wednesday former members of the Stock Exchange will be
transferred automatically, subject only to a check of their continuing good
standing with regulators such as the Securities and Futures Authority.
Other experienced practitioners in areas such as corporate finance,
investment management, futures trading and back office settlement can also
take advantage of the window. They will face an interview, however, and will
be required to show 15 years' experience - or 10 years if they have a
relevant qualification, such as chartered accountancy.
At present the institute, which is less than a year old, has 5,000 members,
including about 4,000 from the Stock Exchange - which no longer offers
individual membership, following structural reforms last year. The
short-term target is for 5,500 members.
After March 31 new full-members will be accepted only on passing diploma
examinations. To be held twice a year, these will involve three sessions,
each of three hours.
The institute aims to be the main professional body for the securities
industry, promoting standards of skill and ethics.
It is involved in discussions about a possible merger with the
long-established Institute of Investment Management and Research, a more
specialised body.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Statistics chief seeks business links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL McLENNAN, head of the Government Statistical Service, is looking for
ways to improve the data it can offer government departments and businesses.
An internal inquiry into the operations of the service is trying to find and
fill gaps in the provision of data.
Mr McLennan wants the service to form stronger links with the business
world, mainly because he believes better business contacts will focus
statisticians' minds on data that other people find useful. He also wants
the service to examine ways to gain more finance via private-sector sales.
The investigation covers the statistical work of about 30 Whitehall
departments and has been ordered by Mr McLennan.
The study, due to be completed by the end of this year, is likely to focus
on specific items of data that could be sold to companies, either directly
by the government or through private-sector statistical agencies.
The statistical service, which employs about 5,000 people, of whom 700 are
statisticians, has an annual budget of about Pounds 120m, virtually all of
which is met from public funds.
The service co-ordinates the statistical work of officials in a range of
government departments including health, transport, social security,
employment, trade and industry and defence.
The inquiry is likely to focus on ways to:
Obtain from different government departments statistics that relate to
specific regions of the UK, for instance in the field or housing or
environmental issues.
Allow individual departments to pool more of their data, for example to
determine the statistical links between areas such as unemployment and
health.
Use computers and telecommunications more effectively to channel data
between government departments and users.
Bring together in an accessible form specific kinds of data of interest to
the business world.
Link sources of statistics in the UK more closely with those in other parts
of Europe to enable a better comparison of broad trends in areas such as
transport or social security.
Identify new surveys which might be needed to plug gaps in knowledge, for
instance concerning the service industry which is less well monitored than
manufacturing.
Mr McLennan, an Australian who was appointed to the GSS just over a year
ago, has recently won the approval of ministers to redirect the work of the
service to make its work more relevant to companies as well as to other
parts of the government.
He is also director of the Central Statistical Office, which is mainly
concerned with economic data and answers to the Treasury. He has introduced
more rigorous procedures in the CSO to reduce leaks of sensitive economic
information.

Fimbra said that Mr Thomas Kelly of DD Financial Management, based in
Warminster in Wiltshire, was 'not fit to carry on investment business in

appointed representative of a life company and as an appointed
representative of DBS Financial Management, a Fimbra member, at the same

He had been ordered 'to cease conducting and soliciting investment business

FT  22 MAR 93 / Baltic rises from wreckage: The return of trading to the
bombed exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING at London's historic Baltic Exchange resumes early next month, just
less than a year after an IRA bomb wrecked the London shipping market's
headquarters.
The Baltic has emerged from the disaster - in which three people were killed
and dozens injured - as a much smaller institution. Managers have been
forced to slash the scale of back-up operations it provides, reducing staff
by two thirds.
Complete restoration of the 91-year-old, grade 2 listed building - one of
the City's best known landmarks - could take a further three years.
Mr Jim Buckley, the Baltic's chief executive, says, 'It has not been an
entirely happy experience. In fact it has been a nightmare.'
Mr Buckley took seven months to negotiate a Pounds 27.6m insurance
settlement. Although there is enough money to cover repair work and many
other costs, Mr Buckley says the insurance was insufficient to cover the
entire cost of the disrupt-ion.
The ordeal started last April when the building's facade took the full force
of the bomb blast. Pieces of Swedish granite and carved Portland stone were
hurled through the building's lavish interior. Steel columns clad in Italian
and Greek marble, nine glass domes, including a central dome 40ft in
diameter, moulded bronze chandeliers, stained-glass windows and a 23,000 sq
ft Rhodesian walnut trading floor all sustained heavy damage.
Ironically, trading was barely affected. Brokers who buy and sell space on
ships for bulk cargoes ranging from oil to phosphate, and from grain to
sugar, improvised in the first few days after the explosion and within a
week had rented alternative premises at the nearby Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
Mr Buckley says it was merely a 'hiccup' in trading, which generates about
Dollars 1.4bn a year in commission income.
However, the impact on the exchange, its staff and the small businesses
associated with it has been far more severe. Because so many of the small
offices surrounding the trading floor were destroyed, the exchange's annual
income of Pounds 5m a year was immediately halved by the loss of Pounds 2.5m
a year in rent.
'We have been out of the building a lot longer than we had expected,' Mr
Buckley says. 'The insurance wasn't going to cover all our costs.' He has
set aside Pounds 7 1/2 m of the Pounds 27.6m settlement to meet that loss
over the next three years. A further Pounds 1m covered the cost of a year's
rental income at Lloyd's, while the immediate clean-up and refurbishment
have cost about Pounds 3m. That leaves just Pounds 15m to carry out
essential rebuilding work, and although the sum will be enough to restore
the building to grade 2 status, there will be insufficient cash to rebuild
the 110,000 sq ft of office space.
'We have had to husband our resources carefully on behalf of our members,'
says Mr Buckley, who was forced to dismiss 100 of the exchange's 150 staff
last May. Many of the small businesses which surrounded the exchange - the
Italian sandwich shop next door, the wine bar and the restaurants, and the
gym in the basement - have little hope of being re-established.
'There is a bitter and human side of the story,' Mr Buckley concludes.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Labour calls for probe at Kellogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday called on
the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the refusal of Kellogg, the
cereals maker, to supply two discount supermarket chains.
In a letter to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, Mr
Griffiths took up the case of the refusal by Kellogg to continue to supply
Shoprite and United Norwest Co-operatives.
Mr Griffiths said yesterday: 'I believe that large supermarkets are behind
this and action must be taken to bring prices down for consumers.
'It is my view that there has been no thorough investigation which has got
to grips with the massive power over suppliers and wholesalers of the big
supermarkets.'
His letter spells out the basis of the case which Shoprite put to the OFT a
few weeks ago.
It says that between November 1990 and February this year Kellogg supplied
Shoprite with a range of items and that, with Kellogg's knowledge, Shoprite
sold cornflakes below cost price.
In January this year, however, Kellogg wrote to all its customers, saying
that it would not supply a brand to a retailer selling that brand below or
at cost price.
In 1990, when asked by Aldi, the German food discounter, to investigate
allegations of manufacturers refusing to supply discounters, the OFT said it
would monitor the situation.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Straw seeks fresh line on clause IV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW approach by the Labour party to public ownership is urged today in a
pamphlet by Mr Jack Straw, a senior shadow cabinet member.
Mr Straw's call to revise clause IV of the Labour party's constitution,
which deals with 'common ownership', has already re-ignited the controversy
between the traditionalists and modernisers in the party, outraging some
leftwing MPs.
Mr Straw said on London Weekend Television's Walden programme yesterday: 'We
may perhaps conclude that the reluctance to bite this particular bullet
speaks volumes for our timidity, our lack of confidence in our beliefs.'
Party officials said that although Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, had
made it clear that he regarded a debate about clause IV as an unnecessary
diversion from Labour's main task, he was relaxed about Mr Straw's wish to
stimulate discussion on the issue.
Mr Straw argued that when clause IV was written about 75 years ago Labour
was seeking an alternative to laissez-faire capitalism, and that its
economic analysis had to change in the light of the failure of Marxist-based
economies.
'At the heart of what Labour stands for is the conviction that the market
must be made to work for the people,' Mr Straw said. No Labour manifesto had
ever said that the way of increasing prosperity was to nationalise
everything.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Patten predicts new constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S constitution and institutions face fundamental change by the turn
of the century, according to a study published today.
In the study by the European Policy Forum, a free-market think tank, Mr John
Patten, education secretary, says the Citizen's Charter has started a
rolling programme of constitutional reform which will introduce a new
constitutional settlement by 2000.
Mr Patten says the government's approach is to introduce new ways of running
the country on a step-by-step basis. This involves:
Giving citizens 'real rather than paper rights' through the Citizen's
Charter.
Encouraging active participation in the way things are run at local level.
Changes to the criminal and civil justice systems to ensure a just outcome.
The restructuring of local government to 'reflect local needs and
sentiments'.
He says the result of the government's approach is a growing body of clearly
defined rights.
This process renders 'civil rights less liable to sudden change or collapse
than is the case when they derive from the vague provisions of a written
document, when one particular interpretation by a few jurists can nullify
everything at a stroke', Mr Patten says.
Mr Frank Vibert, director of the forum, says change in the British system of
government is inevitable and radical reforms are needed to revive a
machinery of government, which is under pressure from the need to be more
effective in setting the European agenda.
Mr Vibert proposes drawing ministers from outside parliament and direct or
indirect elections to the Lords.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Shephard says plans for jobless may grow swiftly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCHEMES to help the unemployed that were announced in last week's Budget
could be expanded swiftly, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
said yesterday.
But such a move could be at the expense of existing programmes for the
unemployed.
The measures, including a Community Action programme which will provide
benefit plus Pounds 10 for 60,000 people who want to work part-time and
receive help with job-hunting the rest of the time, were widely welcomed for
their new approach, but criticised for being too small-scale.
Apart from Community Action, the other main scheme announced in the Budget
is called Learning for Work and funds 30,000 unemployed people to pursue
full-time vocationally relevant education.
Mrs Shephard said on BBC television's On The Record: 'If we find that these
measures work better for unemployed people and, indeed, as investments in
the economy, then certainly what I would look at is reviewing what we are
already doing, and perhaps switching from some of those ways of helping
unemployed people into these new ways.'
The Employment Department believes that results from the four pilot
'Workstart' projects will come through quickly enough to enable it to bid
for an expanded programme in the autumn spending round negotiations. The
initial Pounds 2.6m scheme will give an employer a one-year subsidy of
Pounds 60-a-week for taking on someone who has been unemployed for a long
time.
Mrs Shephard said the four pilot schemes would be deliberately varied to
give the widest possible range of circumstances for testing the idea.
Two will be run by the Employment Service and the other two by the Training
and Enterprise Councils. Half the schemes will be for people who have been
unemployed for more than two years and the other half for people who have
been unemployed for more than four years. The 1,000 places will not
necessarily be divided equally between the four schemes.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Auditing role urged for non-executive directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE boards should establish audit committees composed exclusively of
non-executive directors, say guidelines published today by Pro Ned, the
organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors and which is
backed by the Bank of England.
The recommendations are similar to those adopted last year by the Cadbury
committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. The guidelines
were adopted in consultation with Pro Ned's sponsors, who include the Stock
Exchange, the Institutional Shareholders Committee and the Confederation of
British Industry.
Pro Ned says board-level audit committees should be responsible for ensuring
that a company's financial and accounting systems provide accurate and
up-to-date information, that the financial statements give a true and fair
picture of its position, and that the external audit is conducted in a
thorough manner.
External auditors should be able to meet privately with the audit committee
at least once a year to enable the auditors to raise unresolved issues of
concern, the guidelines say. Also, the full board should circulate a
resolution authorising the committee to ensure that senior and middle
managers understand and accept the nature and purposes of the committee.
The audit committee's functions should include reviewing half-year and
annual financial statements before they go to the board, and reviewing
statements issued at the time of a rights issue, an acquisition or a bid
defence.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Power chiefs hold out on coal deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADS of several regional electricity companies said last night that
they were still unwilling to sign deals to buy coal until the government
published its white paper on the future of the coal industry. The government
has said it wants the deals signed before the white paper.
After a weekend of talks in the coal and electricity industries there was
continuing uncertainty about whether the government could publish its coal
white paper before the Easter parliamentary recess.
British Coal executives and the electricity companies said considerable
progress had been made in the talks on contracts which will replace those
ending this month. Most outstanding differences were resolved.
Senior executives at the corporation are resigned to the uncertainty over
the industry's future continuing for several months after it emerged on
Friday that the white paper would not include details of deals for coal
additional to those for 'base contracts' which were the subject of the
weekend negotiations.
One corporation executive said: 'The white paper will not be the end of the
story, just a further stage in the process. We still hope to keep some pits
open but how many is uncertain.' The best guess is that fewer than 10 of the
31 pits will be kept in the corporation's ownership, although several more
may be leased to the private sector.
At the weekend outstanding issues between the two generating companies and
some of the regional distribution companies were resolved without the need
to resort to binding arbitration. British Coal and the generators also
settled most remaining differences.
Even if the government and the electricity companies resolve their dispute
over whether signing the deals or publishing the white paper should come
first, ministers have a tight timetable if they want to publish this week.
Some electricity companies said yesterday they were prepared to sign
contracts before the white paper if the government provided written
guarantees on several issues.
Regional companies want to be sure the government does not alter its
timetable for liberalising the electricity supply market. The generators are
seeking assurances that they will not be forced to sell generating plant
they no longer want to operate.
Several companies said the detail of the contracts, most of which are more
than 200 pages long, meant that signing before the end of the week would be
impossible even if the assurances were provided.
One chief executive said last night he was strongly against signing before
the white paper was published. He would be consulting with other companies,
and this would affect how firm a stance he would take, but 'in any case we
cannot sign by Thursday'.
That is the day the cabinet meets and the first opportunity the government
is likely to have to publish the white paper.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Miners struggle to find paydirt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL Enterprise, founded to create jobs in coalfield areas, has
launched a research project to discover how more ex-miners can be turned
into successful businessmen.
'Our view is miners don't make very good entrepreneurs. They make good
employees,' said northern regional BCE manager Mr Roland Stevenson.
With hundreds of miners leaving the industry each week and more pit closures
looming, BCE is working with Durham University Business School to study how
suitable ex-miners would be for a career in business. Mr Stevenson said the
aim of the Durham study was to see 'if there is something hidden we can
bring out'.
Since its formation in 1984, BCE claims to have been highly successful in
placing former miners in new employment and helping coalfield companies,
through financial support, to create more jobs.
But its experience helping them become entrepreneurs has been more mixed. Of
the relatively small number who have opted for self-employment, few have
created substantial businesses and some have failed, losing their redundancy
money.
As part of the research, co-funded by the Department of Trade and Industry,
BCE has started running pilot one-day workshops in north-east England and
the Midlands, in which ex-miners planning self-employment undergo
psychometric analysis and behaviour studies. The sessions are intended to
gauge personality traits such as goal orientation, leadership, communication
skills, the ability to thrive under pressure and willingness to take risks.
The research is also assessing a selection of companies in Durham and
Bristol to identify which qualities in the person at the helm have
contributed to their survival.
Since 1985 the number of miners employed by British Coal has dropped from
191,000 to 33,000. BCE estimates that of 27,207 ex-employees, including
miners and white-collar staff, whom it has resettled since 1987, 2,070 have
become self-employed. It does not know how many are still in business.
Ex-British Coal employees no longer in business include Mr Michael Peary of
Pegswood, Northumberland. His British Gnome Stores at the Gateshead Metro
Centre, which opened in the late 1980s and did a brisk trade in Thatcher
gnomes, closed a year ago. Mr Peary was reluctant to discuss his experience
but said: 'There were quite a few of us at the time went into
self-employment. As far as I know there's none of us self-employed now.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / Wider sentencing powers called for
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, England's most senior judge, yesterday
appealed for 'sanity' to be restored to court sentencing through an urgent
review of legislation which tied judges' hands.
Lord Taylor told the annual conference of the Law Society of Scotland that
the fundamental error underlying the 1991 Criminal Justice Act - which does
not apply in Scotland - 'is a misconceived notion that sentencing should be
programmed so as to restrict the discretion of the sentencing judge'. The
desire to confine custodial sentencing to cases where it is really necessary
'has led to restrictive provisions forcing the judge into an ill-fitting
straitjacket.'
He said judges should have wider powers to impose custody sentences for
youngsters.

FT  22 MAR 93 / ICI waste output falls sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reduced its
worldwide emissions to land, sea and air by 9 per cent from a total of
5.68bn tonnes in 1991 to 5.167bn tonnes last year, the company states in its
second environmental report, Paul Abrahams writes.
Hazardous waste was cut by 26 per cent from 475,000 tonnes in 1991 to
350,000 tonnes last year. That represents a fall of 48 per cent since 1990.
Over the same period non-hazardous waste was cut by 9.7 per cent. Waste
production overall has fallen by 14 per cent since 1990.
The group was fined and prosecuted 21 times for environmental incidents,
including seven times in the US, four times in continental Europe and five
times in the UK. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said there was clearly much
to be done in this area.

FT  22 MAR 93 / MP demands to see Lamont on Equatorial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEITH Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, last night demanded an early
meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, over the Bank of England's
role in the collapse of Equatorial Bank, to which administrators were
appointed on Friday.
Mr Vaz said that at a meeting on Thursday night Equatorial Bank officials
asked the Bank of England to make up a shortfall of between Pounds 7m and
Pounds 10m to allow it to continue trading.
According to Mr Vaz this request was refused and administrators were called
in under insolvency laws.
The Bank of England refused to comment.
Mr Vaz said: 'I will be pressing the chancellor at the earliest opportunity
on the issue of why the Bank of England did not intervene.'
More than 90 per cent of Equatorial's 3,000 customers in the UK are of Asian
origin. Mr Vaz told a meeting of about 100 creditors, customers and
employees in London yesterday: 'This is further pressure on the Asian
community at a very difficult time.'
Accountants Ernst &amp; Young were appointed administrators following a petition
from directors. High provisions against bad and doubtful debts led to fears
that the bank would have inadequate capital.
The bank is believed to have suffered a loss of liquidity because some
customers withdrew deposits after publicity surrounding the closure of Bank
of Credit and Commerce International in 1991.
The administrators said that the draft balance sheet of the bank, which has
Pounds 117m of assets, showed that it was still solvent it was hoped that
all creditors would be paid in full. A creditors' meeting will be held
within three months.
The bank is believed to have a number of depositors in east Africa and
India. Its customers in the UK are concentrated among the Gujarati-speaking
community and include many Asian small businesses.
Ernst &amp; Young said that the administration had been caused by the large
provisions the bank had made 'which resulted in prospective capital
inadequacy for regulatory purposes'. The bank is licensed and supervised by
the Bank of England.
In the bank's last published annual report, for the year to September 1991,
pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 549,474 compared with Pounds 879,282 for the
previous year.

5.68bn tonnes in 1991 to 5.167bn tonnes last year, the company states in its

Hazardous waste, ICI's main priority, was cut by 26 per cent from 475,000
tonnes in 1991 to 350,000 tonnes last year. That represents a fall of 48 per
cent since 1990. Over the same period non-hazardous waste was cut by 9.7 per
cent. Waste production overall has fallen by 14 per cent since 1990. The
group aims to reduce wastes by 50 per cent by 1995, using 1990 as a
baseline.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'The achievements made to date are
impressive and are a credit to the individual skills, determination and
enthusiasm of everyone in the group.'
The group was nevertheless fined and prosecuted 21 times for environmental
incidents, including seven times in the US, four times in continental Europe
and five times in the UK. The total number of prosecutions and fines was 26
in 1991 and 30 in 1990. Sir Denys said there was clearly much to be done in
this area.
ICI restated its emission figures for 1990 and 1991 to exclude water
evaporation at a plant in Pakistan and deep well injection in the US.
Earlier figures given by the company for all emissions had been 8.627bn
tonnes for 1990 (restated at 6.012bn), and 8.31bn tonnes in 1991.
Between 1991 and 1992 capital expenditure on environmental measures
increased from about Pounds 130m to about Pounds 170m while environmental
operating costs rose from about Pounds 180m to about Pounds 170m.
Non-hazardous waste disposed on land fell from 1.47bn tonnes in 1991 to
1.468bn last year. Non-hazardous emissions to air dropped from 297,000
tonnes to 280,000 tonnes over the same period. Non-hazardous wastes to water
fell from 3.484bn to 3.068bn.
Energy consumption fell 12 per cent during 1992 compared with 1990.

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Election arouses little excitement among
voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francois Albert, a retired building worker, has voted Socialist all his
life and sees no reason to stop now. 'I'm not saying this government has
been perfect, but at least they've done their best,' he said yesterday after
casting his vote in the first round of the French parliamentary elections at
the town hall of the 4th arrondissement in Paris.
'The polls say the right will win this time. Maybe they will. What will
happen to pensioners like me then?'
Mr Albert, like the rest of the French electorate, will probably find out
next Sunday after the second and final round of voting in the elections.
The atmosphere in Paris yesterday was as downbeat as the rest of the
campaign. French law imposes rigorous restrictions on electoral publicity.
Candidates may not spend more than FFr500,000 (Pounds 63,000) on their
campaigns and there are other tight curbs in force for the six months before
the vote.
The tourists milling around Paris yesterday in the spring sunshine could
have been forgiven for not realising an election was in progress. There were
none of the blockbuster advertising campaigns that mark US elections, nor
the eager canvassers who badger voters outside many other European polling
stations.
The only signs of the French vote were a few fly posters, odd splashes of
graffiti and the billboards of smiling candidates pasted up outside town
halls.
Moreover, the tone of the campaign, the 10th parliamentary polls in the
Fifth Republic, has been subdued even by French standards. The apparently
inevitable conservative landslide, coupled with President Francois
Mitterrand's determination to stay on at the Elysee Palace until the 1995
presidential poll, has sapped the electorate's enthusiasm.
'All the parties are as bad as each other,' said Mr Alexandre Mercier, a
young shop assistant, voting in the 4th arrondissement. 'The left is
useless. The right is useless too. I've voted for the ecologists, not
because I believe in them but because I can't stand the rest.'
Even conservative voters were unenthusiastic. 'I've voted conservative
because the sooner the left goes the better,' said an elderly woman. 'But
nothing will really change in France until that man Mitterrand goes too.'
Some are so disillusioned they are not bothering to vote at all. Mr Francis
Bertaux and Mr Patrick Miller, two designers in the Marais area of Paris,
abstained yesterday and plan to skip the second round of voting next Sunday
in favour of spending the evening at the Matisse exhibition in the Georges
Pompidou Centre.
'We don't believe in any of the parties,' said Mr Miller. 'Everyone will be
at glued to their televisions at home next Sunday, watching the final
results. It'll be our only chance to see the Matisse show without the usual
crowds.'

FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Shocked ecologists see hopes collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unexpected victims of yesterday's right-wing landslide were the two
ecology parties, which received a possibly terminal blow to their hopes of
becoming a force in national politics.
According to early exit polls, Les Verts and Generation Ecologie pulled in a
mere 8.5 per cent of the votes. That is around half of their score at the
peak of their popularity at the turn of the year and well below the nearly
14 per cent they recorded in regional elections a year ago. As the count
continued, it looked as if their first-round score could fall below 8 per
cent, at which level they would win no seats. Their fate questions the
commonly held belief that the Green movement was the main beneficiary of the
Socialists' decline.
'A crushing majority (for the right) would bury France in concrete,' mourned
Mr Antoine Waechter, leader of Les Verts, the more hardline of the ecology
pair. He called on his election candidates to fight on to the second round
'however few in number'. He claimed the Greens had been victims of
'political manoeuvres and false candidatures'. The one positive element in
yesterday's setback was that 'ecology was a confirmed part of the French
political landscape', he claimed.
His partner, Mr Brice Lalonde, a former Socialist environment minister, was
less cheerful. The result was a 'disappointment' due partly to France's
majority voting system and partly to the fact that other political groups
had sought to steal the Green vote.
Pre-election polls had shown that support for ecologists lay in what had
been traditional Socialist territory - the young, graduates, middle managers
and religious agnostics. Many observers believed the two parties' decision
to make an electoral pact, as Entente des Ecologistes, after months of
wrangling, would help them build on last year's regional election success.
However, the pact failed to reconcile splits on a whole series of issues,
from nuclear power to the strategy to adopt with a new government - a
failure which appears to have sapped their credibility.
