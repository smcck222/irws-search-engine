FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (13): Searching look at monopolies - Now
media ownership is being investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as some Milanese journalists thought the corruption scandal might be
dying down, a new line of inquiry has emerged to keep judges and the press
occupied.
This time, the magistrates eyes have focused on the media. In an unexpected
twist, investigations on the allocation of valuable television broadcasting
frequencies have presented magistrates with a fruitful line of inquiry.
This issue has rekindled interest in the whole question of press and media
ownership in Italy. In few other countries is the press so closely attached
to big business and the relationship so slavishly reflected in editorial
policy.
Until last year, Italian law posed few limits on ownership of newspapers,
magazines and even broadcasting, allowing a free-for-all with few parallels
in the developed world. Though restrictions have now been imposed, they are
relatively loose compared with other European countries.
Proprietorial interference is regularly denied by all media sectors, in
spite of most leading newspapers and news magazines invariably reflecting
their owners' opinions. Arch-rivals Carlo De Benedetti and Silvio Berlusconi
recently have been using their publications for a long-distance slanging
match. Born out of differing views on the economy, it has developed into a
tit-for-tat campaign of 'revelations' about alleged involvements in the
corruption scandal.
The battle has encouraged a form of investigative journalism not common in
Italy by pitching talented editorial teams against each other. La
Repubblica, the De Benedetti-controlled daily, is the best source of
information on alleged misdemeanours of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company,
while Panorama, the Berlusconi-controlled weekly, has specialised in
'exposes' on the De Benedetti group.
The magistrates' inquiries have also taken the lid off another highly
controversial aspect of media policy - the so-called Mammi law of the late
1980s, which attempted to impose order on the chaotic world of broadcasting.
Here too, the focus is on Mr Berlusconi. The law, named after Mr Oscar
Mammi, a former posts and telecommunications minister, sanctified
Fininvest's control of Italy's three leading private television channels - a
position many think places too much power in Mr Berlusconi's hands. But
earlier this month, the new Ciampi government ordered a revision of the law.
Foremost among the law's critics are Italy's newspaper proprietors, who
claim Fininvest has used its strong position in TV broadcasting to take too
large a slice of the overall advertising cake.
The proprietors' criticisms backed by energetic lobbying has been influenced
by the downturn in advertising during the recession. Though advertising
revenues have fallen by less than 10 per cent for most newspapers in the
past year, preliminary figures for this year suggest the drop is much
sharper, with smaller regional papers being hardest hit.
Added to Mr Berlusconi's troubles is the Italian authorities' plan to impose
tough new rules on the use of advertising slots in sponsored TV shows. The
'breaks' - most common in the game shows pioneered by Fininvest channels -
are an important source of revenue for the group. Typically, a show host
cuts away from the contestants and scantily-clad show girls to extol the
virtues of a sponsor's products. Fininvest claims curbs on breaks could cost
it about L400bn a year.
Fininvest's recent named association in the corruption scandal has also
exacerbated matters for Mr Berlusconi's group. But it need hardly be
embarrassed by the company it keeps. Other large companies with media
interests, such as Fiat, Olivetti (controlled by Mr De Benedetti's Cir
group) Ferruzzi and Eni, have already made their debuts before the
magistrates for a variety of alleged kickbacks to politicians.
The allegations of Fininvest's involvement in the corruption scandal come at
a particularly sensitive time. The signing of a lucrative L420m contract by
Mr Davide Giacalone, a consultant who helped Mr Mammi draft the original
broadcasting rules, with Fininvest has come to light.
Fininvest says the contract with Mr Giacalone was entirely above board and
the renumeration reasonable for his level of expertise.
The company has also responded to criticisms of its alleged media monopoly.
It says in observing the Mammi law it has given up control of its three
pay-TV channels for a minority stake. It has also sold Il Giornale, a
highly-regarded Milan daily paper - though significantly, ownership passed
to Mr Berlusconi's brother, Paolo. And its 45 per cent audience share of the
three Fininvest TV channels is no higher than that of other single private
television operators abroad, it claims
Focus on the media has come at a time of unprecedented commercial ferment in
the industry. Financial difficulties at Ferruzzi, the big private-sector
industrial group, could soon put its newspaper (Il Messaggero) and national
TV channel (Telemontecarlo) on the block. And Eni, the public-sector energy
and chemicals group, has said Il Giorno, its Milan-based daily newspaper, is
to be sold.
Finding buyers in a recession will not be easy. The international media boom
of the mid-80s, which saw the arrival of huge cross-border takeovers, has
long gone and many of the big media groups which grew through acquisitions
are focusing on debt reduction.
Italian buyers could also prove difficult to find. The handful of very big
companies such as Pirelli, have traditionally eschewed media interests and
show no sign of changing their minds. Although their are indications that
some smaller entrepreneurs could be interested, the assets likely to be for
sale represent too big a mouthful for most of Italy's small-to-medium sized
businesses leaders.
But it is possible that bankers may try to assemble consortia of investors
for some of the assets up for disposal. This is a solution being considered
for Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based newspaper. Otherwise, proprietors may find
themselves holding on to media assets for longer than hoped.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ICI and Du Pont fibres swap expected
shortly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ASSET swap between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont,
the US group, is expected to be completed within the next few days.
The deal, which involves ICI and Du Pont exchanging their respective fibres
and acrylics businesses, was first announced in April last year, but has
been held up by objections from the American Federal Trade Commission, the
US competition authority. The two companies had originally hoped to conclude
the swap by the end of last year.
However, ICI will not receive the full Pounds 250m provisionally agreed when
the swap was first revealed because of deteriorating trading conditions in
the European fibres market. The sector is suffering from over-capacity,
sluggish demand and poor prices. Demand in the automotive market is
particularly depressed.
The FTC's clearance will prove a relief for other chemicals companies. There
have been fears that efforts to rationalise the industry in some loss-making
sectors could fall foul of competition authorities in the US and Europe.
It remains unclear whether the FTC will insist ICI disposes of any of its
American acrylics operations. These are small, however, and will not prevent
the company becoming the world's largest manufacturer of acrylics with sales
of about Pounds 500m. Du Pont's business has sales of about Pounds 160m.
Du Pont is acquiring fibres operations with sales of about Pounds 600m a
year. The company has had only limited fibres production in Europe, but will
now become one of the leading nylon manufacturers in the continent.
The American company still has to find a buyer for 12,000 tonnes of nylon
carpet production in Europe. The European Commission said the capacity had
to be sold.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Debenham Tewson advances to Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEBENHAM TEWSON &amp; Chinnocks, the quoted property adviser which merged with
Bernard Thorpe, a firm of chartered surveyors, in a deal worth Pounds 10.9m
in February, yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.59m
to Pounds 2.86m for the year to April 30.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman, said that Thorpe's 10-week contribution coincided
with its 'historical heavy weighting of profitability' in its final quarter.
Of the enlarged group's operating profits of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.68m),
Pounds 2.06m came from DTC and Pounds 1.05m from Thorpe. Mr Lay said that
Thorpe's contribution represented virtually its whole year's profits. 'In
that respect, we timed the merger well,' he said.
DTC was strong in London and the south-east, he added, and Thorpe was very
strong in the regions. That made the merger - known as DTZ Debenham Thorpe -
'one of the most significant advances in our industry in recent times', Mr
Lay said.
Group turnover of continuing businesses totalled Pounds 41m (Pounds 34.8m),
to which Thorpe pitched in Pounds 5.75m. Mr Lay said that 'after the most
appalling recession', there was now a change of mood.
A final dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3p (2.5p), payable from
earnings of 5.13p (2.76p).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING PROFITS from brokerage lifted pre-tax profits at Lowndes Lambert, the
insurance broker, by 11 per cent to Pounds 10.3m in the year to March 31,
writes Andrew Jack.
Broking profits more than doubled to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 1.6m), while
interest fell to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 5.9m). The expense ratio improved from
96.7 per cent of brokerage to 92.4 per cent.
Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 53.7m. Earnings per share emerged at 28p
(25.8p). A final dividend of 9p brings the total to 13.5p (12.6p).
Mr Richard Shaw, chairman and chief executive, said rates were hardening and
that there were significant opportunities for underwriting profits.
Acquisitions in the second half cost Pounds 5.1m, and included the fine arts
broking arm of Crowley Colosso, Jeffreys Coates and Associates, Robert
Barrow (Victoria) in Australia and Berkeley Burke in Hong Kong.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: US firms dodge the drought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even during the most severe periods of drought, the extensive grounds at
Hewlett-Packard's plant in Santa Rosa, California, remain fresh and
well-watered.
Life at the plant was not always this green, though. Shortly after spending
Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) on landscaping at its facilities back in 1977, the
company faced severe water shortages and acres of wilting plants.
Then someone had the idea of re-using waste water from manufacturing to
irrigate the grounds. The idea took off, and Hewlett-Packard has recently
been extending its enthusiasm for water recycling to other areas. The
company has experimented with using waste water for toilets on its sites and
will soon begin to use industrially-tainted water for rinsing in some
manufacturing processes.
Faced with droughts, water use restrictions and increasingly stringent
standards for effluents, more and more US companies are beginning to view
water as a precious resource.
'Rates have gone sky-high over the last two decades,' says Robert Brown, an
environmental manager at Hewlett-Packard. 'We now pay Dollars 1.47 for every
1,000 gallons we use and Dollars 5.48 for every 1,000 we dump into sewage.
That has led to a complete re-thinking of our water usage.'
Companies anxious to trim water costs are increasingly creative in finding
ways to reduce consumption. Texaco, for instance, is altering plant design
at many of its oil refineries to cut water usage.
'We have gone to air coolers rather than water coolers,' says Leslie Lakie,
environmental manager. 'We've also switched from steam to electric pumps.'
Whenever Texaco does use water, the company tries to ensure that it has
already been used in another part of the refinery. 'The basic rule these
days is to use the water over and over again until it gets so dirty that you
have to clean it up,' says Lakie. 'We have cut water usage by up to 90 per
cent at some refineries.'
Environmental consultants say that in certain cases, reducing water usage is
a matter of common sense. 'A lot of the problems arise from carelessness,
like leaks that haven't been fixed, or spillage,' says Charles Moores, an
environmental consultant at Badger Engineering. 'With water rates soaring,
though, companies can't afford that kind of waste.'
For industries like food and pharmaceuticals, which need extremely clean
water, re-cycling poses particular problems. But even here water re-use is
not out of the question.
'In many cases, these companies have to clean up water supplies even before
they use them,' says Christopher Simmons of Ionpure, which produces water
purifying systems. 'Because they start with ultra-clean water, even after
it's gone through the manufacturing process it can still be cleaner than tap
water. It makes sense to clean up the used water rather than take in new
stuff.'
Companies are also finding alternative water sources. The Chevron refinery
in Richmond, California, plans to start using district sanitation water -
which can be purchased more cheaply than fresh water - early next year. A
new federal law requiring companies to collect rain water in an bid to
prevent pollution from surface run-off has also created an alternative water
source for some groups.
Other companies, such as Shell, are taking in sea water, which is cheaper
than fresh water, for processes that are resistant to salt contamination,
though its corrosive nature makes this process less popular.
Although US manufacturers use far less water than a decade ago,
environmental consultants believe most groups have a long way to go before
they achieve high levels of water use efficiency.
'This is a matter of economics. As water becomes more expensive to use and
clean up, we'll see more and more water conservation in manufacturing.
What's happened so far is just the tip of the iceberg,' says Moores.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Management: Dispelling the macho myth / Experiencing the
pleasure and pain of outdoor training courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overgrown boy scouts who derive pleasure from other people's pain? Or
underrated professionals who help companies achieve their business goals?
Earlier this year a British television documentary on outdoor management
trainers lent weight to the more sadistic view. Using vivid footage from six
days of apparent purgatory in Scotland, the programme included images of
acute executive suffering, even humiliation. The man who ran the course
complained that he had been unfairly represented, but other 'outdoor'
specialists worried that they might be tarred with the same brush.
Chris Cotton, a director of Truro-based Training In Action, was one of them.
He therefore invited me to join 10 personnel, training and other middle to
senior managers on one of his quarterly 'appreciation' courses run from a
converted 16th century thatched barn and round-house on the edge of
Dartmoor. The thinking behind these 36-hour 'experiences' is to let
participants judge the value of the outdoor training approach for
themselves.
The core of our programme, which ran from late on a Tuesday afternoon to
early Thursday morning, comprised three well-conceived and entertaining
outdoor exercises, involving an emergency rescue, raft and bridge building
to tight deadlines, and a night-time search - with compasses and flashlights
 -for a long-lost 'glass chalice'.
As Cotton emphasised, the outdoors is only a vehicle for the overall process
of learning about communication, team roles and development and the
management of change at work (topics covered on our course). Training in
Action uses the so-called experimental learning approach which incorporates
review sessions - in which groups are encouraged to analyse the process by
which the task was (or was not) achieved - and teaching modules. As well as
muddy boots, participants therefore take away some understanding of concepts
like Johari Windows (a framework for improving self-perception and the
perception of others) and snippets of the work of management gurus such as
Meredith Belbin.
Most 'appreciation course' members endorsed Cotton's claim that outdoor
training can be 'a memorable experience' which is sufficiently different
from a manager's everyday work that it becomes possible 'to concentrate on
the management process rather than getting bogged down in the task itself'.
Kevin Murphy, training manager of HMS Personnel Services (part of BET), says
it is always an advantage not to have 'the usual clutter of departmental
restrictions or traditional limitations' on a course.
'The outdoors can also offer a much safer environment for people to fail; in
the workplace the perception is that reputations, even careers, can be at
stake. Making it safe to fail encourages people to take chances and try out
new ideas, methods etc - this is when the greatest benefits can be derived.'
Lesley Dayson, training manager of computer distributors Front Line
Distribution, was not alone in arriving on Dartmoor 'with the impression
that it was all about having a good time'. But the experience changed her
opinion.
Training in Action scored high marks - particularly from the five women on
the course - for disavowing the 'macho' approach. 'It is my belief that
participants should not be forced into situations that cause serious
physical or mental stress, as this is often counterproductive,' says the
development trainer of a multinational company.
That point was illustrated when one hitherto intrepid member of our team
suddenly felt claustrophobic inside a cave, and was quickly accompanied back
to base.
'Safety conscious', 'never confrontational' and 'possessed of a strong
vision' were other tributes paid to Cotton and his colleague Richard Jones.
'The course was enjoyable, not physical and put greater emphasis on brain
power than on physical activity,' comments Lawrence Mitchell, senior
personnel manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Simon Davey, finance director of GMTV, cites the significance of what he
called the 'extra touches' - notably several 'bit parts' in the three
exercises played by a neighbouring farmer. 'I have been on courses which
were unrealistic in this regard and simply led to frustration and
exhaustion,' he says.
The acid test for Training in Action, though, is whether flattering words
will ultimately be matched with corporate training budget deeds. Most of the
participants said that they would happily send junior or middle managers on
a course - even board members in one case - but that money, senior colleages
and established consultancy arrangements were among the obstacles. 'I'd like
to . . . but it's a big sell,' is how the management development manager of
a leading retailer sums it up.
Cotton says training managers often share his convictions, but that 'a
problem is persuading senior managers that they are not going to be keel
hauled in some out-of-the-way place'. Two months after the 'appreciation'
event he has no firm bookings but hopes that three or four of the companies
will consider signing up in the autumn.

pleasure and pain of outdoor training courses

There were three of us, up to our waists in a swamp - and blindfolded.
The engineer, whose trousers I was clutching by the waistband, was
describing the muddy horrors he could feel ahead and I was doing my best to
warn the personnel assistant, who was clinging to the back of my swimming
costume.
This apparently showed the importance of communication.
The marsh is the bit most people who complete a Raleigh International
(formerly Operation Raleigh) selection course remember best, but it was not
the trek through the mud that defeated me. I was beaten by 10 poles lying on
the ground, of which more later.
Raleigh's demanding selection weekend was designed to test young people to
see if they are ready to be sent to the developing world to work on
community projects such as building bridges and clearing rivers. It is now
aggressively marketing the scheme to employers as a management development
product.
The initiative reflects the pressure on charities whose rules permit them to
raise money by offering their services commercially.
Raleigh now has a respectably long list of sponsors, an increasing number of
which encourage their junior employees (aged 17 to 25) to apply. They then
sponsor those picked to go on the 10-week adventures.
Organisations including TGI Friday's, the US restaurant chain owned in the
UK by Whitbread, and British Rail, are prepared to provide Pounds 3,950 for
each successful candidate to become a 'venturer'.
The fortunate few join teams of other young people who have applied off
their own backs. Raleigh also funds places for young offenders and socially
and physically disadvantaged people.
Raleigh is developing its management products. The organisation recently
appointed Sue Wilkins, formerly group training and development manager at
bookmakers William Hill.
The charity is also setting up an overseas course for managers with Ashridge
Management College, and offers customised outdoor staff development courses
in the UK.
When I arrived for my selection weekend, probably not even averagely fit, in
lipstick and high-heels, the Raleigh staff smothered smiles. 'It will be fun
picking on you tomorrow,' one said at the pub in East Grinstead, East
Sussex, where we met.
I was already nervous. Candidates on selection weekends have been injured
and the expeditions themselves involve risks. Two venturers and one staff
member have died, all in freak accidents, the charity says.
After last orders it was off to the candidates' quarters where, jammed
between a snoring signalman and an inflatable dinghy, I slept.
At 9am sharp we started 30 hours of non-stop problem-solving which tested
logic, physics, stamina and temper.
This included skinning a frozen rabbit, hiking through the darkness to
rescue an 'injured' person who had to be carried back on a stretcher,
answering personal questions and giving three-minute speeches.
In the middle of all this were the judges, both hectoring and helpful.
Scurrying around making notes in little blue books, they laughed at our
suffering and chose all the wrong moments to remind us to 'keep smiling' or
to ask: 'So, why Raleigh?'
Much went wrong. Our bridge broke, our raft sank, our egg catapult went 10
yards instead of 70, our bivouac collapsed, we didn't finish building the
Lego house and the porridge was burnt and spilt. Everyone got soaked from
head to foot.
None of this fazed me. I was beaten by the 10 poles, lying parallel on the
ground.
On Sunday morning, stupid with cold and wet, we were told to make five
crosses, each of which could only be created by one pole skipping two others
to land on a third.
The other team members failed too. We were firmly ticked off and made to do
10 star jumps: 'It does happen on expeditions you know. You are cold and you
are wet and you can't just give up and let someone else do it,' the judge
said.
Despite the disasters and the misery, I could understand why employers see
them as a good management tool.
The value of team work and planning was spelled out: the rewards and
difficulties of giving and taking help, of accepting weaknesses and using
strengths with confidence.
Alan Percox, BR personnel director for production services, believes it is
leadership skills which show the biggest improvement. Staff are willing to
take on responsibility and need less support.
Percox says the scheme makes solid financial sense: 'For about Pounds 2,000
we are saved 12 to 18 months' formal training which would probably cost up
to Pounds 6,000.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Coke fails the kosher cola test say rabbis

IN ISRAEL things don't always go better with Coke.
The country's 360,000-strong ultra-orthodox Jewish community is intensifying
pressure on a leading rabbi to remove his kashrut - the kosher certificate
stamped on every product - from the soft drink.
Coca-Cola is the latest victim of a rising tide of fundamentalist Jewish
consumer boycotts. Among Coca-Cola's 'sins' are sponsorship of the music
cable television channel MTV, 'immodest advertising', and desecration of the
sabbath by advertising on Saturday - including sponsoring the Jerusalem
International Film Festival which will show films on the sabbath.
The focus of the pressure is Rabbi Moshe Landa, chief rabbi of the Bnei Brak
rabinical court, who granted the kosher certificate to Coca-Cola.
Rabbi Landa last month successfully pressed for the withdrawal of the kosher
certificate from Pepsi because of its sponsorship of Michael Jackson
concerts and its 'immodest' advertising which was 'poisoning the souls' of
Israeli youth.
The attack against Coca-Cola comes a week after leading rabbis signed a
religious decree calling for the removal of kashrut certificates from food
companies which use advertising agencies that produce 'immodest' billboards.
'The holy land is filled with abomination. We cannot walk in our streets,'
said Rabbi Eliezer Schach, one of the sponsors of the decree.
In Haredi (ultra-orthodox) neighbourhoods billboards have been put up
attacking the rabbi. One says: 'Coca-Cola continues to enjoy all worlds:
they enjoy the Rabbi Landa certificate and give platforms to idol singers of
the most lowly and abominable kind.'
The PR departments of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are trying to play down the
problem but are refusing to alter their advertising. Among the objections of
the orthodox community are Pepsi's use of the slogan 'The new generation'
and billboards showing a young woman in jeans showing her bare arms and a
hint of stomach.
'You have to understand that the Haredi feel that they are not just fighting
a soft drink but a culture,' said Professor Menachem Friedman, a sociology
lecturer at the Bar Ilan university. 'Like the Moslem fundamentalists they
feel Pepsi and Coca-Cola are selling a type of western secular permissive
culture which identifies with movie stars and rock bands. They find
themselves increasingly threatened and in a war with that culture.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Contractors tied to bribery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government was shaken yesterday by fresh allegations of
bribe-taking by a regional mayor and by the arrest of executives at four
general contractors, which public prosecutors say provided the politician
with Y100m (Pounds 630,000) in expectation of public works contracts.
Mr Toru Ishii, the mayor of Sendai, in northern Japan, and the former head
of a national mayors' association, was arrested by prosecutors, who also
raided the offices of the contractors - Hazama, Nishimatsu Construction,
Mitsui Construction, and Shimizu, the country's leading construction
company.
The case could provide further evidence for the US government, which has
claimed that bid-rigging and political deals are common in the Japanese
construction market, limiting opportunities for foreign companies competing
for public works contracts.
Mr Ishii's arrest was a shock for the ruling Liberal Democratic party, which
has been generally pleased by its returns at a weekend election for the
Tokyo metropolitan government, and is increasingly confident that the party
will not perform as poorly as expected at a general election on July 18.
Prosecutors alleged that Mr Ishii, 67, sponsored by the LDP and some
opposition parties at a mayoral election last year, met construction company
executives at a Tokyo restaurant in April last year. They further allege
that the companies gave him Y100m, three providing Y30m and Mitsui
Construction giving Y10m.
The construction companies denied the funds were bribes, but prosecutors
yesterday arrested the chairman, president, and managing director of Hazama,
said to have arranged the restaurant meeting, and a vice-president at each
of the other three contractors.
After the arrests, the Construction Ministry immediately placed an
indefinite ban on the companies' participation in bidding for public works
contracts under its jurisdiction. The ministry said the allegations are
'regrettable' and 'come when the public is losing confidence in the
construction industry'.
The case follows prosecutors' raids on 18 contractors' offices, inspired by
the investigation into Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's former godfather and fund
manager, who is awaiting trial for tax evasion. The trial is due to begin
four days after the general election.
LDP leaders, forced to call an election after losing a parliamentary
no-confidence vote, fear that the arrest of Mr Ishii, one of the country's
most venerable mayors, will again stir public demands for the reform a
scandal-prone political system and provoke a voter backlash against the
party.
Mr Ishii, a former official at the Home Affairs Ministry, oversaw rapid
development in Sendai, the largest city in the north of Honshu, the main
island.
He was re-elected for a third four-year term in November, promising to
redevelop the area around Sendai station and the local harbour, projects
which would be lucrative for general contractors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION is close on a formula which would gradually introduce more
competition in the eastern German electricity industry. Only one local
council is holding out against a deal that would resolve the future of the
region's electricity supply and pave the way for limited foreign
involvement.
The compromise, which involves eastern Germany's 164 local councils, the
association of municipal utilities, the economics ministry, and west
Germany's utility companies, would give councils access to power generation.
It would also allow them to buy 30 per cent of their electricity needs
locally, or from a foreign supplier, and to form partnerships with
outsiders.
The compromise also means that Vereinigte Enerkiwerke, or Veag, eastern
Germany's main utility which operates the region's high voltage grid, could
speed up its massive investment programme.
The deal results from opposition by eastern Germany's local councils to the
Stromvertrag, or electricity contract, signed in August 1990 between the two
Germanies.
Ostensibly it set out to modernise eastern Germany's power industry, but
with little room for competition. Not only were the east's local councils
denied the right to generate their own power, but the grid, sales, and
distribution of energy were monopolised by western Germany's eight utility
companies.
However, the local councils appealed to the constitutional court, arguing
they had the right to claim 100 per cent of the regional utilities' assets
because they had owned them until 1952 before they were expropriated by the
Communist regime. The court upheld the Stromvertrag but suggested a
compromise.
The councils will be allowed to sell their 49 per cent stakes in the
regional utilities. At the same time, the councils will be free to use the
assets to meet 30 per cent of their energy needs. However, they must still
obtain 70 per cent of their electricity from the regional utilities, which
in turn must obtain 70 per cent from Veag.

It would also allow them to buy 30 per cent of their electricity needs

The compromise, which would end the uncertainty about who had the right to

speed up its massive investment programme.
The deal results from opposition by eastern Germany's local councils to the

Ostensibly it set out to modernise eastern Germany's power industry, but
with little room for competition. Not only were the east's local councils
denied the right to generate their own power, but the grid, sales, and
distribution of energy were monopolised by western Germany's eight utility
companies.
RWE Energie, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, the country's three largest
utilities, together obtained a 75 per cent stake in Veag. The rest was
divided among the five other utility companies. These eight companies were
also given majority stakes in eastern Germany's 15 regional distribution
networks.
In order to underwrite Veag's massive investment programme in eastern
Germany, the Stromvertrag stated that only 49 per cent of eastern Germany's
regional utilities could be owned by the local councils. The regional
operators had to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag for the next 20
years; and the local councils in turn had to buy 70 per cent of their
electricity from the regional utilities.
However, the local councils, which opposed the emergence of a monopoly,
appealed to the constitutional court, arguing they had the right to claim
100 per cent of the regional utilities' assets because they had owned them
until 1952 before they were expropriated by the Communist regime. The court
upheld the Stromvertrag but suggested a compromise, accepted by all but one
council.
The councils will be allowed sell their 49 per cent stakes in the regional
utilities. Local cities and regional utilities are likely to have priority
over foreigners. At the same time, with the assets, the councils will be
free to meet 30 per cent of their energy needs from whatever source they
choose. However, they must still obtain 70 per cent of their electricity
needs from the regional utilities, which in turn must obtain 70 per cent of
their electricity from Veag.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Canadian wages under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTS of Toronto will be unable to pay their municipal taxes or apply
for marriage licences on three Fridays this summer - all in the name of
holding down the wage bill of Canada's biggest city.
In what is becoming a countrywide pattern of fiscal restraint, Toronto will
close its municipal offices and halt all but essential services on these
days, forcing about 9,000 municipal workers to take three days' unpaid
leave.
The recession has forced many Canadian businesses either to freeze or roll
back wages. But the squeeze is gradually extending to the public sector,
despite the presence of powerful unions.
Statistics Canada reported that wage rises in April averaged 0.2 per cent a
year. The small rise was largely due to a wage freeze on federal civil
servants. Ontario's provincial government is in the process of negotiating a
three-year freeze with unions representing over 900,000 public-sector
workers.
The diminishing upward pressure on wages is one reason for economists'
optimism that inflation in Canada will remain dormant for at least the next
year or two. The consumer price index edged up by 1.8 per cent in the year
to April, and is not expected to climb more than 2-3 per cent this year or
in 1994.
Public office-holders are also under intense scrutiny to limit pay
increases. Leaders of Canada's two main political parties have expressed
displeasure over a vote by the Senate, the non-elected upper house, to give
each member an extra CDollars 6,000 (USDollars 4,687) a year in travel and
accommodation allowances.

FT  30 JUN 93 / An economist with political nous: Larry Summers has made his
mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN POLITICS your job is as important as you make it. This, at any rate,
appears to be the modus operandi of Mr Lawrence Summers, the forceful
under-secretary for international affairs at the US treasury.
Mr Summers is only the third-ranking official at the treasury; yet this has
not stopped him from speaking out authoritatively on a wide range of issues,
some of which would appear to be the responsibility of other departments.
For example, in a series of speeches - most recently to Japanese businessmen
in Tokyo - Mr Summers has set out the general principles underlying trade
relations between Japan and the US.
Mr David Mulford, who held Mr Summers' job in the Bush administration,
tended to focus more narrowly on the financial services sector and left
general trade policy to the US trade representative or the commerce
secretary, the two top trade officials.
While many appointees of President Bill Clinton are still struggling to find
their feet, Mr Summers has set about rapidly carving out a position of
influence within the administration.
His stature in part reflects his having served the perfect apprenticeship
for his job.
As chief economist at the World Bank for two years up to last November's
election, Mr Summers became familiar with nearly all the issues now
confronting him, such as economic reform in Russia, policy co-ordination
between Group of Seven countries and third world development.
He also had a chance to build important personal relationships with leading
economic policy makers in Europe and Japan.
But Mr Summers also brings intellectual gifts to the job. Still technically
on leave from Harvard University, Mr Summers has just won an award he long
coveted: the John Bates Clark Medal, presented every two years to the
'outstanding American economist under the age of 40.'
Academics do occasionally get political posts but it is rare for a young
economist to drop research for the hurly-burly of Washington politics.
As most members of Mr Clinton's economic team have been fully absorbed with
domestic policy - especially the struggle to win congressional support for
the deficit-cutting economic package, Mr Summers has had a relatively free
hand to mould international policy.
He has been instrumental in shaping a two-pronged global strategy consisting
of a 're-invigorated multilateral effort' to strengthen global economic
growth and an 'export-activist' trade policy designed to open markets and
make other countries 'bear a greater responsibility for supporting the
global trading system.'
In both areas Mr Summers has tried to present policy in terms likely to
appeal to Washington's Group of Seven partners.
For example, he encouraged his boss, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, to stress that
economic co-operation is a 'two-way street' in which the US will respect the
views of allies.
Viewed from Tokyo, Mr Summers' brand of co-operation looks more like
coercion: Tokyo is being pressed hard to adopt a more expansionary fiscal
policy and to halve its current account surplus as a fraction of national
income.
Mr Summers has been active on many other fronts. He is one of the
administration's strongest proponents of more generous US and international
support for Russian economic reforms.
Soon after arriving at the treasury he began to put pressure on the
International Monetary Fund to agree new more flexible rules for lending to
formerly communist countries.
The so-called 'Systemic Transformation Facility' was duly announced in April
and the IMF announced the first tranche of a Dollars 3bn loan to Russia this
week.
Mr Summers is also showing greater sensitivity to the needs of developing
countries than his Republican predecessors. He has signalled that the US
would join other industrialised countries in offering more generous debt
relief to low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.
He is putting his inside knowledge of flaws in World Bank operational
procedures to good use. He has pressed the World Bank and other development
institutions to sharpen their focus on poverty relief and alter the way they
conduct business by placing less emphasis on the approval of loans and more
on the supervision of projects.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to move the headquarters of its
audio business from the Dutch town of Eindhoven to Singapore, reflecting the
buoyancy of economies in the Far East and their importance in setting new
trends in consumer electronics, writes Ronald van de Krol from Amsterdam.
The move to Singapore will also bring management closer to Philips' audio
production sites in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, where the bulk of the
company's hi-fi equipment is made. Philips has only two audio production
sites left in Europe, one in Austria and the other in Belgium, which is
already being slimmed down.
Philips' main competitors, especially Sony of Japan, are also located in the
Far East.
The transfer away from Eindhoven is part of a strategy of getting closer to
the market. Previously, the car stereo business was moved to Germany, the
centre of Europe's motor industry, while the video business's management was
shifted to Vienna, where Philips produces video cassette recorders.
Philips' audio staff in Eindhoven will be cut to 20 from 66. Thirty-five
jobs will be eliminated, and the rest will be transferred to the Far East.
Overall, Philips employs 6,625 people in audio, most of them in Far Eastern
factories.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Catalan MPs courted by Socialists: Gonzalez in search for
government partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S parliament yesterday met for the first time since the general
election earlier this month, re-electing the speaker and paving the way for
Mr Felipe Gonzalez to be sworn in for a fourth term as premier.
King Juan Carlos now begins formal consultations with party political
leaders and is expected to inform the speaker next week of his candidate for
prime minister - certain to be Mr Gonzalez.
Mr Gonzalez, whose Socialist party (PSOE) lacks a parliamentary majority,
said he might include the PNV, the small Basque nationalist party, in the
government and that he still hoped to persuade the more reluctant Catalan
nationalists of the larger CiU party to become junior partners in a
coalition administration.
The PSOE won 159 seats in the elections two weeks ago, 17 short of an
overall majority in the 350-member chamber.
An investiture debate, in which Mr Gonzalez would seek a vote of confidence,
could be held as early as Thursday next week and the new government
announced shortly after.
The Socialist leader is expected to present his programme to parliament some
time next week before the vote of confidence. He needs an absolute majority
to be confirmed at the first vote. Should he fail to get it, he can be
confirmed by simple majority in a second vote two days later.
The need for a broad-based government has been heightened by a back-bench
revolt among Socialist MPs against Mr Gonzalez' nomination of Mr Carlos
Solchaga as the party's parliamentary leader.
Mr Solchaga, a former economy minister, is widely distrusted by the left
wing of the party and by the unions. He secured the nomination by 87 votes
to 66 with six abstentions. Spokesmen for the rebel group said, however,
they would respect the majority decision and pledged loyalty to Mr Solchaga.
The Catalan politicians are understood to be under considerable pressure
from Barcelona business leaders to overturn their initial refusal last week
to back Mr Gonzalez. CiU support would ensure a stable government and its
business-orientated policies would reassure the markets.
Hopes for a final agreement between Mr Gonzalez and the nationalist parties
were fuelled yesterday when PNV and CiU members of parliament voted
alongside the Socialists to re-elect Mr Felix Pons, a Socialist, as speaker.
Fellow Socialist Juan Jose Laborda was returned as speaker of the 256-seat
Senate.
Mr Solchaga meanwhile tendered an olive branch to the nationalists by
co-opting a Basque MP to the parliamentary standing committee in place of a
member of the Communist-led United Left (IU) group.
Reuter adds: The Basques, whose five seats would not alone be enough to give
the PSOE a majority, are still open to the possibility of a coalition and
have guaranteed to co-operate in creating a viable administration,
Urged by a strong current of orthodox Socialist opinion, Mr Gonzalez also
has the option of some sort of parliamentary deal with the United Left,
which has 18 seats. He is due to meet an IU official today.

The charges involve Oto Trasm, in which Graziano Trasmissioni, a company
chaired by Mr Ghidella, has a 49 per cent stake. Warrants have also been
issued against five other managers of Oto Trasm appointed by Graziano
Trasmissioni. The charges include embezzlement against the state and
fraudulent trading of the company's shares. Mr Ghidella, who set up in
business independently after leaving Fiat, is now involved in the Swiss
Saurer engineering group and Italian automotive activities.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Germans to ease law on waste burning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY intends to introduce legislation to allow both domestic and
industrial waste to be incinerated when recycling proves too costly,
according to Mr Thomas Rummler, a director responsible for waste disposal at
the federal environment ministry.
The move would represent a shift in Germany's tough environmental policies,
which place severe restrictions on incineration.
'Recycling will continue to be given priority but incineration will be
permitted when recycling does not make sense economically or when it is more
expensive,' Mr Rummler said at a conference on waste management jointly
organised by The Financial Times and the Boston Consulting Group.
Germany's environmental policies have recently been under renewed attack
from industrial lobbies, including the German federation of industry. They
are complaining that German waste disposal laws place an unfair burden on
businesses struggling against recession and intense foreign competition.
Germany has some of the strictest environmental laws in Europe. It also has
a draft bill which plans to force manufacturers to take back durable
consumer goods like electronic and white goods and recycle the materials.
Industrialists at the conference raised questions on the validity of the
German approach to 'recycle at all costs'.
Computer manufacturers, for example, argue that energy recovery, such as
burning plastics and using the resulting heat for cement kilns, is a viable
alternative to recycling. France, Denmark and Belgium are currently using
such incineration methods.
Mr Rummler said the new legislation would foresee the construction of
incineration plants. Such projects have until now been highly controversial
in Germany and new moves to establish incinerators are likely to be fiercely
resisted by communities and environmental groups.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Ruling defuses GM's row in Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN district court order requiring General Motors to keep producing
Calibra cars in Finland, while a bitter dispute with its former Finnish
partner Saab-Valmet is resolved, has been set aside by the Frankfurt Court
of Appeal.
The court acted after GM and Saab-Valmet, part of the majority state-owned
paper machinery and engineering group, said they had reached a business
compromise. Under it, Saab-Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki, Finland, will
produce up to 6,000 Calibras between June 1 this year and the end of next
March, during which an arbitration panel will seek a final settlement.
The earlier district court ruling, made in March, ordered GM to allocate 30
per cent of Calibra output to the Valmet plant.
Under the compromise, both sides also agreed that neither would initiate
other injunction measures during arbitration. GM ceased all Calibra
production in Finland in December, moving Finnish assembly to Germany to
improve capacity utilisation at its Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added
cost penalties of production in Finland.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Poland unveils plan for oil industry privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND plans to keep its oil refining and petroleum products distribution in
the hands of private domestic investors, while seeking to attract foreign
investment in individual refineries and petrol station networks.
According to Dr Andrzej Olechowski, a former finance minister retained by
the government to prepare a plan for the privatisation of the sector, the
industry would be reorganised into a holding company, the Polish Oil Company
(POC). This would then be privatised through the sale of shares at a
discount to local banks, financial institutions and small investors.
A 30 per cent share would stay in state hands or foreign financial
institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in
which Poland has a share.
The plan, which has yet to be accepted by the Council of Ministers, foresees
the sale of a 50 per cent share in Poland's two major refineries at Plock
and Gdansk to foreign investors. The purchasers would also have the right to
buy some state-owned petrol stations. The remaining 50 per cent share in the
refineries would stay in the hands of the POC.
The sale of the sector, according to Dr Olechowski, is designed to raise
Dollars 2.5bn for modernising the industry to improve competitiveness once
15 per cent tariffs on petrol imports start to be phased out in 1998.
Amoco is to explore for coalbed methane in the Upper Silesian coalfield in
southern Poland.
The contract for three-year drilling is estimated to be worth Dollars 10m,
and will be implemented once the Polish government has agreed to ease tax
provisions and provide safeguards against foreign exchange risks arising
from the steady devaluation of the zloty.

FT  30 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome remained under the hammer in a generally unhappy health and
household sector, with the market said to have been unsettled by a very
low-priced 'print' or trade in the ADR's, recorded on the Seaq ticker during
the session, indicating that the shares had come under heavy selling
pressure in the US.
Wellcome shares have attracted sustained selling pressure over the past few
weeks as the market has worried about the challenge being mounted to
Wellcome's patent in the US on its AZT anti-Aids drug. The court case, being
held in North Carolina, commenced on Monday.
At their worst yesterday Wellcome traded as low as 660p, before stabilising
and moving up to end a busy day at 673p, for a net loss of 15, the lowest
closing level since July 1991. Turnover was never more than thin and
eventually reached 1.1m shares.
Wall Street's early weakness triggered selling of all the leading
pharmaceuticals stocks in London. Glaxo, hit recently by numerous broker
downgrades, lost 7 more to 563p on 2.7m traded. SmithKline Beecham moved
against the overall trend, however, settling a net 2 higher at 437p on 1.2m,
following support from one of the leading UK broking houses.
ICI, under constant pressure recently following some hefty profits
downgrades by top broking firms, rallied to close 5 1/2 up at 658p on 2m
traded. Ever-present takeover speculation drove Fisons up 2 more to 179p,
after 180p.
French theme park operator Euro Disney fell 12 to 798p after French press
reports that attendances have fallen dramatically in the last quarter.
Favourable comment on Monday's results and acquisition helped Airtours gain
4 to 338p. Rival tour operator Owners Abroad climbed 4 to 102p and Eurocamp
also added 4 to 231p.
Profit-taking restricted Thorn EMI, off 5 at 910p, and Rank Organisation, 16
down at 780p.
The Irish banks responded to currency moves with Allied Irish up 6 at 263p
and Bank of Ireland the same amount firmer at 253p.
Caledonia Investment jumped 25 t0 484p after announcing a 38 per cent
increase in preliminary profits.
Prudential Group held up well in an otherwise weak life assurance sector,
the shares steadying around the 340 1/2 p-mark after a strong buy
recommendation issued by Hoare Govett. The broker's insurance team said
Prudential shares offered 'significant upside' and that Prudential's
dividend growth will at least equal that of the UK market and more likely
outperform.
Royal Insurance continued to outpace the rest of the composites, moving up 6
more to 310p on good turnover of 3.9m. Insurance brokers attracted renewed
strong support with Lowndes Lambert 5 up at 384p after excellent results,
showing profits up 11 per cent at Pounds 10.3m. JIB put on 7 to 217p.
Seeboard hit the front in the regional electricity sector's 'dividend race',
upping the dividend by 16 per cent, and easily outpacing the early runners
in the sector's 'payout stakes'. 'The race is still on,' said one utilities
analyst. Electricity shares have risen sharply this week, responding to
strong buy recommendations issued by leading brokers such as Kleinwort
Benson and Smith New Court.
Seeboard ended a busy session a net 10 higher at 520p, followed by the likes
of Midland, up 9 1/2 at 481 1/2 p ahead of figures due on July 6, and
Southern, up 8 1/2 at 471 1/2 p ahead of preliminaries due on July 1.
Among the recs that have already declared their results, Yorkshire put on 10
to 512p, and Norweb 6 to 495p.
The latest spurt by the 'recs' triggered a fresh burst of support for
Northern Ireland Electricity which advanced 5 to 130p on good turnover of
4.9m; Prudential Corporation announced it has acquired 5.19m shares, or a
3.15 per cent stake, in the company since its flotation last week.
Securicor and its associate Security Services made rapid progress after
revealing profits up 27 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. Securicor 'A'
jumped 11 to 645p and Security Services 14 to 549p.
Ferranti dropped 3 to 11 3/4 p after the continuing losses with the shares
additionally weakened by the sale of a block of 2m shares as part of a
mid-morning programme trade.
Banana dealer Geest climbed on news that Germany had lost its case in the
European Court of Justice against the introduction of the new EC import
system for bananas.
A slightly downbeat trading statement from Sears left the stores group a
half-penny adrift at 99p.
The appointment of a new chief executive at Storehouse ended a 4-month
period of uncertainty and the shares advanced 3 to 212p.
A confident forecast and reasonable results by John Waddington pleased the
market, sending the shares up 11 to 230p in moderate turnover.
Shares of newly-named publisher Headline Hodder closed marginally better at
355p in its new ex-rights form as it made its debut in the market.

Overseas acquisitions are likely to be top of the shopping list for United
Newspapers following yesterday's Pounds 190m cash call, and analysts were
generally in agreement that the company had made a sound move.
There was some feeling that the company - which refused to be drawn on the
exact nature of the potential acquisitions - might have been more open about
its intentions. Mr David Forster at Smith New Court was slightly bearish,
saying that the market would have preferred 'a flavour' of what the targets
would be. But he believed the one-for-five rights issue at 480p would be
'grudgingly' taken up.
The share price slipped back 11 to 574p in a volume of 1.3m - a modest
decline which some analysts read as a confident market comment. The offer
was also largely seen as well-priced at a discount of 18 per cent to the
market price.
'Despite the dilution in earnings, it is a good move,' said one analyst who
was unconcerned at the vague nature of United's acquisition intentions.
'They are only expected to look at small things - there would be some
concern if it was thought they were looking at big things.'
United also made a confident forecast on its profits for the first six
months of this year.

THE PREMIUM price paid by Granada Group for its near-15 per cent voting
stake in rival LWT sparked a surge in television company shares as the
market braced itself for a wave of further strategic moves within the
sector. Granada's surprise move, described as 'audacious' by one media
specialist, leaves the leisure and television group well placed to take
advantage of the expected relaxing of regulations currently limiting mergers
and acquisitions in the sector.
The main loser from yesterday's events was seen to be Carlton Communications
which was thought to have high hopes of itself buying a strategic stake in
its London rival. Analysts said that it was highly likely that Carlton would
be in the market over the next few days in an attempt to gain a toe-hold in
LWT. With Granada likely to stay on the acquisitive track, Central is also
seen as another company that could be prompted into moving soon, with Anglia
the likely target. In addition, Granada now has a way into Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees, where it recently lost out to LWT for a WH Smith's 15 per cent stake.
Dealers said that BZW bought the 13.7m LWT convertible preference shares at
500p from three big institutional shareholders for Pounds 67.9m. They closed
at 466p, a big jump of 91p. Carlton, which also lost its managing-director
to Storehouse yesterday, tumbled 13 to 770p. Central gained 107 to 2,065p,
Anglia 36 to 353p and Yorkshire 14 to 199p. Granada's share price closed 3
down at 417p.

FT  30 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blue chips weaker as support fades

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market lost its US buyer of stock index futures yesterday
and interest rate optimism alone proved not enough to sustain share prices.
The struggle to hold the Footsie 2,900 level, regained in early trading, was
again lost towards the close when Wall Street came in lower following
disappointing data on the US economy.
Selling pressure was light, however, and some enthusiasm was stimulated by
corporate activity, especially among the domestic television industry
stocks. Analysts at the leading securities firms continued to recommend a
range of switching moves towards stocks regarded as underperformers. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 5.2 to close at another all-time high of 3,229.1.
UK equities opened higher as Wall Street's 39 point gain overnight took some
of the pressure off the drug sector and also raised hopes that US buyers of
the London stock index future contract would continue to push the UK market
forward. Indications, as soon as stock index futures opened, that the US
buyer was not active, were ignored at first and the stock market advanced by
8 points to 2,905.
But the market went abruptly into reverse when some futures traders believed
that a US house had turned seller of the September future, and the slide in
share prices accelerated in the face of a significant sell programme from a
UK house.
The selling hit the Footsie 100 list hard and the market gave ground
steadily to show, at the day's worst, a loss of nearly 14 points. A modest
rally brought a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,886, a net loss of 11
points since the previous close.
The Footsie Index has returned to its previous testing area, having made no
convincing progress over the past week. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon
commented that the Footsie Index looked 'precarious' on the index charts.
The absence yesterday of the basket trading between index futures and blue
chip stocks which has provided sustenance for equities for several session
left the Footsie-listed issues looking vulnerable.
Interest rate optimism also went into a decline, in spite of the renewed
climb in sterling yesterday afternoon. Although some strategists continued
to insist that the Bundesbank is likely to make a move at its policy meeting
on Thursday, analysts of the UK scene were less certain that rates will be
cut in the UK before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, introduces his
autumn budget. The stock market also fears that any benefits arising from a
cut in base rates could be offset by rises in domestic taxation.
However, the fixed income team at Nikko believe that; 'lower (UK) interest
rates later in the year are inevitable, given the poor outlook for growth.'
In addition to its many other reasons for caution, the equity market is now
restrained by the prospects for today's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of
long-dated government bonds. Institutional activity has been at a low ebb
this week as fund managers have raised cash for the gilt-edged auction.
Rights issues have also reappeared this week, and yesterday's Pounds 190m
rights call from United Newspapers revived market rumours that further cash
calls are in the pipeline.

FURTHER profit taking in stock index futures brought a decline which saw the
September contract on the FT-SE test the 2,900 resistance level, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The September contract opened at 2,920 taking its cue from the strong
overnight performance on Wall Street. But this positive start made little
lasting impression and having risen to the 2,926 within the first hour, it
went into retreat.
Most of the selling was led by independent traders and had the effect of
pulling the underlying cash market lower as it gathered pace. Sentiment was
also dampened by a poor gilts sector, a rights issue from United Newspapers,
and a sell programme from Smith New Court.
Having traded between 2,910 and 2,905 for most of the session, a big seller
saw September fall to the day's low of 2,901 in the last hour of trading.
However, bargain hunting just ahead of the close brought a modest rally and
the contract finished at 2,904, down 15 on its previous close but 6 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 11 points. Volume improved to
7,368 lots.
The traded options was more lively and recorded improved turnover of 27,066,
against 21,964 contracts the previous day. The FT-SE 100 option saw business
of 8,815 contracts, while 3,875 lots was recorded in the Euro FT-SE 100
option. Grand Metropolitan was the most active stock option with a day's
total of 1,777 lots.

HEAVY demand for YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company, pushed
its shares to a USDollars 6 premium in frantic grey market trading in Buenos
Aires, writes John Barham.
Against an offer price of Dollars 19, YPF stock closed at Dollars 21.65, 14
per cent up. At lunchtime it reached Dollars 25 due to heavy demand from
institutional investors. But YPF depressed other stocks.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Construction raids sink
Nikkei at close

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKS ended sharply lower on reports that four major construction companies
had been raided by prosecutors on bribery charges, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
Prices also fell on arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking in thin trade as
investors grew wary over political worries.
The Nikkei average finished down 343.34, or 1.7 per cent, at the day's low
of 19,543.42, after a day's high of 19,854.93. Volume was 220m shares with
declining issues leading advancers by three to one.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 19.21 or 1.2 per cent at
1,581.26 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.09 to 1,196.67.
The market opened lower following the fall in Nikkei futures in Chicago
overnight and failed to recover the opening level all morning due to
arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking. Prices fell sharply before the close
on news that four major construction groups had been raided by prosecutors
on bribery charges.
According to a television report, state prosecutors had arrested senior
officials of some construction companies for alleged involvement in the
bribery of the mayor of a city in northern Japan.
The construction scandal renewed concern over domestic politics after
investors had been relieved on Monday following the better than expected
results in Sunday's Tokyo city elections.
Brokers said that investors were also wary about taking fresh positions
ahead of the G7 summit in Tokyo next week.
Construction stocks lost ground: Nishimatsu Construction fell Y80 to Y1,010,
Mitsui Construction by Y34 to Y505 and Shimizu by Y50 to Y820.
Bridgestone, which cut its outlook on parent profits by some 30 per cent on
Monday, slipped Y50 to Y1,240.
Kawasaki Steel slid Y3 to Y355, NKK also lost Y3 to Y309, and Kobe Steel
fell Y15 to Y330 after the three companies announced group losses.
Banking shares fell on profit-taking on expectations of a discount rate cut
in the near future. Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank slipped Y50 to Y2,230 and
Y1,390 respectively.
Roundup
THERE were mixed fortunes in the region yesterday.
HONG KONG closed lower as investors took a lack of political news as a
signal to take profits.
The Hang Seng index ended 40.63 lower at 7,107.47 in turnover of HKDollars
4.8bn.
Brokers said that there was diminished interest in companies considered as
possible targets for takeover by mainland investors seeking a backdoor
listing in Hong Kong.
Dynamic Holdings, seen as a possible takeover target, was one exception,
rising to HKDollars 1.22 before sinking back to finish unchanged at
HKDollars 1.03.
SINGAPORE finished higher on bargain hunting with gains notable among
industrial issues. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 25.38 higher at
1,808.52.
A report that economists have revised their second quarter economic growth
forecast to 6.8 per cent from 6.6 per cent also boosted sentiment.
F &amp; N rose 60 cents to SDollars 12.30 after a healthy interim report.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon to close slightly lower on
profit-taking. The composite index closed down 1.49 at 720.58 after earlier
touching a high of 727.77.
TAIWAN reversed early losses to end higher on late buying in banking stocks.
The weighted index, which fell 57 points at one stage, ended 23.37 up at
4,067.83. Turnover was a thin TDollars 16.7bn.
MANILA rose for the second day but some analysts said that the market was
still in a consolidation phase.
The composite index rose 12.37 to 1,568.78, pushed up largely by the mining
index.
Turnover was 313.38m pesos against Monday's 271.7m pesos.
AUSTRALIA closed off its highs as year-end book-squaring dominated trading.
Most blue chips fell, but gold and bank stocks were firmer.
The All Ordinaries index closed up 3.4 at 1,718.5 in turnover of ADollars
383.3m.
NEW ZEALAND, propelled by strength in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge, again
came near to breaking through its three-year closing high.
The NZSE-40 index ended 11.80 higher at 1,679.34 in turnover of NZDollars
32m.
BOMBAY closed higher after a news conference on Monday by the stockbroker at
the centre of India's Dollars 1.3bn securities scandal failed to produce new
revelations. The BSE index gained 51.02 to 2,213.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Low bond yields keep declines
to minimum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH the latest batch of bad economic news depressed US stocks
yesterday, low bond yields kept declines to a minimum, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.35at 3,518.85,
well above its lows thanks to a late burst of buying. The more broadly based
Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.00 lower at 450.85, while the Amex composite
finished up 0.66 at 433.52, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.77 at 701.07.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 273m shares.
The economic news was bearish. May leading indicators registered a decline
of 0.3 per cent, May home sales plunged 21 per cent, and consumer
confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, fell for the sixth time in
the last seven months, from 61.9 per cent in May to 58.9 per cent in June.
The data suggested that the economy continues to struggle, and does not bode
well for the corporate earnings outlook. While all of this is bad news for
stocks, the sluggish economy has boosted bond prices, sending yields down to
record levels. The low yields have helped prop up equities, which otherwise
might have been in full retreat.
The bad economic news, however, hit cyclical stocks hard. Allied Signal fell
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 5/8 , Caterpillar lost Dollars  3/4 at Dollars
74 1/2 , International Paper dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 and Georgia
Pacific fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Aluminium Co of America
bucked the trend among cyclicals, rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 69 as
investors cheered the news that the company will cut its domestic primary
aluminium capacity by a quarter and lay off about 750 employees. The move is
an attempt to reduce the worldwide overcapacity in aluminium.
Technology stocks, which benefited from Monday's rally, gave back some of
their gains. Compaq, undermined by fears of a personal computer price war,
plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 , Digital Equipment dropped Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , IBM fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 , and
Hewlett-Packard gave up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 82.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed little changed in moderate-to-heavy trading, as a
surge among gold stocks helped offset Northern Telecom's continued decline.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 2.22 points,
or 0.06 per cent, to close at 3,963.23.
Northern Telecom continued its sharp decline, after saying late last Friday
that it expects to report a second-quarter loss and that 1993 earnings would
fall well short of 1992 earnings. The company dropped CDollars 2 1/8 to
CDollars 35 on volume of almost 3m shares, after its CDollars 10 nosedive
yesterday. Its parent, BCE Inc., slipped CDollars 3/8 to CDollars 43 5/8.

TEL AVIV scored a 6.7 per cent gain after the Treasury ruled out imposing
taxes on stock market profits, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
The Mishtanim index rose 12.45 to 199.47, in heavy turnover of Shk237m
(Dollars 84.6m).
On Tuesday, the Mishtanim had fallen to its lowest level since last
November.
However, Mr Abraham Shohat, Israel's finance minister, ended months of
uncertainty on Tuesday evening, saying that he had decided to rule out a
capital gains tax to inject stability into Israel's capital market.
Mr Shohat also said that the imposition of a new tax would have hampered
government plans to privatise several state-owned companies by selling
shares to the public.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners frustrated as Seoul stocks
climb high - A lack of South Korean liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are frustrating times for foreign investors in the Seoul bourse.
Eighteen months after the stock market was opened to direct foreign
investment, the exchange's most attractive shares are no longer available
because they have reached the 10 per cent limit on foreign ownership.
Ninety-nine of the bourse's 693 listed issues have had their foreign
shareholding quota filled, with another 60 close to the ceiling. Most of the
remaining stocks are either too small in terms of capitalisation, or too
obscure to attract foreign institutional investors.
'If ten fund managers decided today that they each wanted to buy Dollars 2m
of a non-financial stock, they would have only 16 companies to choose from,'
explains Ms Joanna Newman, an analyst at WI Carr in Seoul. 'Within a few
months, we think that there will be nothing left to buy.'
Companies associated with Hyundai and Samsung, considered the strongest
industrial groups in South Korea, were the first to reach their foreign
ownership limit.
Overseas buyers have since turned their attention to other big
conglomerates, such as Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar.
As the pool shrinks, 'foreigners are buying shares they otherwise would
never have bought,' notes Mr John Wadle with the Seoul office of BZW.
The troubled banking and petrochemical sectors offer the only large bloc of
shares still available to foreigners, together with Korea Electric Power
(Kepco), the state electricity monopoly.
The foreign ownership limit is particularly troublesome to US fund managers,
who did not enter the Seoul bourse in force until last autumn and found that
UK investors, who initially dominated foreign buying, had already captured
Korea's choicest companies.
It is one reason why Washington is pressuring Seoul to raise the the foreign
ownership ceiling. Mr Hong Jae-hyong, the finance minister, has promised to
do so eventually, but any increase is not likely to come until next year,
when most analysts believe it will be raised to 15 per cent.
The government argues that the foreign shareholding ceiling should be raised
in stages, fearing that excess funds from abroad could add inflationary
pressure by increasing the money supply. The net inflow of foreign funds for
stock purchases has so far reached Dollars 2.65bn this year.
'There is no reason to raise the foreign ownership ceiling now since there
are plenty of stocks still available to foreigners. They have bought only 47
per cent of the number of shares available to them,' says Mr Lim Chang-Yuel,
the assistant minister of finance.
But WI Carr estimates that only 40 per cent of the foreign quota remains
open on a market capitalisation basis, and the ratio falls to 32 per cent
once three large bank stocks (Commercial Bank of Korea, Cho Hung, and Bank
of Seoul) and Kepco are excluded.
Most foreign brokers complain that the real reason the government is
unwilling to raise the ceiling soon is that both officials and businessmen
are reluctant to see foreigners acquire a substantial stake in the country's
main industries. 'It's xenophobia, pure and simple,' says one.
One factor that could force the government to change its mind is that
foreign investment has been an important psychological factor behind the
bourse's recovery from a low of 459 last August to 745 yesterday. 'If
foreign buying tails off, as it is already starting to do, and the market
drops sharply, then the government may be tempted to raise the limit to
bolster share prices,' says Mr Stephen Marvin, head of research at Jardine
Fleming in Seoul.
In the meantime, foreign investors may consider several alternative measures
to obtain Korean shares. One is the unofficial over-the-counter market for
foreigners.
In spite of the absence of a computerised pricing system for OTC
transactions and the considerable short-term risks involved in such deals,
'fund managers are now willing to pay high premiums to acquire blue-chip
shares rather than settle for third-rate stock still on the open market,'
according to Mr Marvin.
Another option is the purchase of offshore paper issued by Korean companies,
such as global depositary receipts (GDRs), But the government is now trying
to restrict offerings because it is concerned that the funds repatriated
home will boost money supply and increase inflationary pressure.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses hover as rate talk
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCUSSION yesterday seemed to centre on whether the German Bundesbank will
reduce interest rates tomorrow - its first key interest rate cut since April
22 - or whether it will wait until July 15, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT levelled out, the DAX index closing just 1.13 higher at 1,708.33
after gaining 10.91 on Monday. Detailed plans for government spending cuts
sat uncomfortably with the recent concentration on cyclical recovery
prospects; interest rate cut hopes, a possible corollary, were muted.
Turnover rose from DM6.1bn to DM7bn. Apart from a DM2.90 decline to DM260.60
in Hoechst, which said that it faced a period of losses from its east German
chemical activities, cyclicals did not come under obvious pressure.
The best gain of the day came from AMB, the non-life insurer, up another
DM50 to DM1,120 in spite of a broker's sell recommendation, for a rise of 24
per cent this month. The company disposed of its biggest problem - a
majority holding in the trade union-associated, and accident prone BfG bank
 -at the end of last year.
PARIS fell back on profit-taking ahead of today's expiry of options and
futures. The CAC-40 index lost 13.45 to 1,977.50, just off the day's low.
Euro Disney, denying reports that it may cut staff, slipped FFr1.45 to
FFr68.35. Spie Batignolles, which said that it expects a further recovery in
business this year, put on FFr5.50 to FFr354.50 and its parent company,
Schneider, gained FFr10 to FFr669.
MILAN was cautious as investors awaited further developments in talks
between the government, unions and employers on a wage accord, while Fiat
came under early pressure ahead of the annual meeting scheduled for today.
The Comit index fell back 4.93 to 535.41.
Commenting on the wage talks, Kleinwort Benson analysts Mr Enrico Ponzone
and Ms Fiona Marshall note that agreement is likely: 'The gravity of the
economic situation, the level of unemployment and the relative weakness of
the unions bode well for a positive outcome'.
There was progress on the other major issue overhanging the market, the 1994
budget, as Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, said that he planned
to present a draft by the middle of next month.
Fiat slipped L119 to L6,332 at the fix, before rising to L6,440 on the kerb.
The telecommunications sector advanced in expectation of the publication of
a plan today on restructuring of the sector. Stet rose L25 to L3,450, and
then to L3,535 on the kerb, for a new year's high. Sip put on L22 to L2,563.
Montedison and Ferruzzi, which had been suspended on Monday, fell back as
investors reacted to news of deeper losses at the former. Montedison lost
L74.50 to L789.00 and Ferfin by L46.90 to L498.50.
ZURICH was lifted by banks and other defensive stocks, and depressed by
cyclicals. The SMI index finished just 1.7 higher at 2,371.4.
UBS bearers were the most active stock at SFr1,095, up SFr125, but Brown
Boveri lost SFr17 to SFr807 following a drop in the share price of its
Swedish partner, Asea, after a block sale in Stockholm, and Sulzer lost
SFr21 to SFr712 after a sell recommendation by a private bank.
STOCKHOLM saw some 7m shares in Asea, the engineering conglomerate, sold by
Investor early in the session, with more than 50 per cent of the shares
placed with foreign institutions. Asea's B shares lost SKr22 to SKr430 while
Investor B's gained SKr2 at SKr118.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 2.5 to 1,077.9.
HELSINKI improved for the third consecutive session, the Hex index closing
1.7 per cent higher at 1,157.7.
Huhtamaki, the confectionery, pharmaceutical and packaging group, was
suspended at its own request at FM186, prior to its announcement that it was
to take over the European confectionery operations of Procordia of Sweden.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen loses to D-Mark and Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDEEP DEOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN reversed direction yesterday, losing ground to both the dollar and
the D-Mark following another corruption scandal in Tokyo and a poor set of
Japanese industrial production figures, writes Sandeep Deol.
The yen closed in London at Y63.26 to the D-Mark after Y62.36 on Monday.
Against the dollar the Japanese currency finished at Y107.10 after Y106.05.
The yen had begun weaker in early European trading, following sales of the
currency in the Far East. Later, the decline continued.
Reports that top officials at several Japanese construction firms had been
arrested on bribery charges had prompted Far Eastern sales, with the market
fearful that this could challenge the Liberal Democratic Party's retention
of power at the general election on July 18.
Mr Nigel Richardson, international economist at Yamaichi in London, pointed
to a weakening in the Japanese economy as having played a role in the yen's
weaker tone. Industrial production data released yesterday showed a sharp
output fall in May.
Mr Richardson forecasts that once the elections are over the Bank of Japan
will ease interest rates to boost the economy. This sentiment seemed
yesterday to be shared by others in financial markets, sparking general
selling of the yen.
The D-Mark moved up to DM1.692 against the dollar in London yesterday from
DM1.70 on Monday. Against the French franc, it improved to FFr3.37 from
FFr3.367.
The D-Mark's firmer tone was supported by news that the German government
had agreed to cut federal spending. The budget agreement raised hopes that
the Bundesbank may cut official interest rates at tomorrow's council
meeting.
Dr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, believes the
central bank will cut the discount rate by  1/2 percentage point from 7.25
per cent. However, he said a rate cut would have been expected whether or
not the new budget had been agreed. The weakened state of German industry
demanded lower interest rates and a weaker currency, he said.
Speculation of an easing was boosted by evidence that the Bundesbank had
been selling dollars and buying its currency in a move interpreted as
boosting the D-Mark ahead of any possible monetary easing.
The dollar saw a slipped slightly from its better levels after the release
of US leading indicators of economic activity for May. These showed a
surprise 0.3 per cent fall against forecasts for a 0.3 per cent rise. The US
consumer confidence index fell to 58.9 per cent in June from a revised 61.9
per cent in May. The market had expected a figure of around 61 per cent.
Sterling had a quiet day on the sidelines in the absence of economic data.
It closed in London at Dollars 1.5040 and DM2.545 from Dollars 1.4930 and
DM2.5375 on Monday.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Muted speculation

TALK of possible cuts in German interest rates tomorrow was the dominant
feature on European money markets as traders weighed up the implications of
the slight rise in the D-Mark against other important currencies, writes
Peter Marsh.
The consensus view was that members of the Bundesbank council may be pushed
into a small cut in German official interest rates by the weight of pressure
from industrialists and politicians both inside and outside Germany.
In support of such notions was the conciliatory tone sounded at the weekend
to the idea of an easing in monetary policy by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
vice president.
Even so, there is a strong body of opinion on financial markets that the
German central bank's worries about inflation and the recent weakness in the
D-Mark may hold it back from any such action.
The fall by almost 1 pfennig in the dollar against the German currency to
DM1.692 at the close of European trading last night slightly pushed the
balance of possibilities in the direction of a cut in interest rates.
That seemed to be the reaction of investors trading Euromark futures, where
the September contract closed slightly up at 93.21 from 93.19 the evening
before. There was a similar upward movement in the December contract, which
ended at 94.30 from 94.27.
The three month French franc contract changed in a similar direction,
closing 3 basis points up at 93.70 from 93.67.
The sterling money markets saw little action as traders took the view that
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, would almost certainly not cut
interest rates in the next month or so until he has taken a broader view
about the strength of any UK recovery.
Comments yesterday by the chancellor that the rise in the pound recently
reflected 'some confidence' in the UK's economic recovery had little impact
on the market.
The September sterling futures contract closed unchanged at 94.15, as did
the December contract, which was last night quoted at 94.33.
In its technical operations, the Bank of England injected Pounds 257m of
late assistance into the banking system bringing the total cash handed out
during the day to Pounds 1.4bn. compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds
1.75bn.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (12): Art becomes more visible - The Uffizi
gallery bombing has focused minds on culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON June 20, the Uffizi Gallery re-opened its doors, a mere 24 days after a
car bomb had severely damaged the western wing of the world's oldest museum.
Five people were killed in the explosion. Inevitably, the public imagination
was caught by what might have happened if the new form of terrorism had
destroyed this priceless collection.
Just as happened after the floods of November l966, when many of Florence's
treasured artworks and books were damaged, volunteers flocked to help.
Indeed, efforts to deal with the aftermath were impressive, including not
only the dedication of the Uffizi team (l50 in all) - with the help of
restorers from the famous Florentine laboratory, the Opificio delle Pietre
Dure - but also the determination of the Mr Alberto Ronchey, the minister of
culture. He insisted the museum be opened, at least in part, at the earliest
possible moment.
The ministry of culture is the poorest of all the ministries, receiving a
mere 0.02 per cent of the state budget - roughly L1,620bn a year. This is
equivalent to the amount spent by the French government on 60 new rooms of
the Louvre - FFr6bn. The Louvre also has five times as many paying visitors
a year as the Uffizi.
Mr Ronchey has proved one of the most successful appointments of the
government formed by Giuliano Amato last June (re-confirmed when Mr Ciampi
took over as Prime Minister in April). He has no party affiliations and is
not an art expert. In fact he started his career as professor of sociology
and economics at Venice University, followed by a long stint in journalism.
As cabinet heads have rolled amid revelations in the long-running bribes
scandal, Mr Ronchey's power has increased. The culture ministry has not been
immune, however. The last but one incumbent is under investigation over the
disappearance of L4bn for 'ghost' restoration works.
Tourism is now part of Mr Ronchey's field, the ministry for tourism and
sport having been demoted to a department of the prime minister's office
after a referendum in April.
The minister has realised the need for public support in his series of
struggles with entrenched Italian bureaucracy. But some of his battles seem
almost irrelevant in the general state of Italy's art - the attempt to
dislodge the Teatro dell'Opera's summer season from the Baths of Caracalla
(it is questionable whether people visit the monument or simply go to view
the elephants and horses of Aida) and banning rock concerts from the Arena
in Verona.
One stroke of genius, however, was his declaration of war on the vast army
of museum custodians by demanding that museums and galleries be open to the
public seven days a week from 9am to 7pm.
This battle was won at the outset in the Italian press, with the public and
tourists. He was mobbed like a pop-star outside the Uffizi on Easter Sunday,
as guides pointed him out to their tour groups as 'the man who opened up the
museums - even on holidays]'
Museum custodians account for 54 per cent of his ministry payroll - the EC
average is 28 per cent - and are high on the list of the most hated
professional groups in Italy. Loathed and feared by museum directors and the
public, they are said to derive pleasure from slamming museum doors in the
faces of tourists on once-in-a-lifetime trips.
Last year there were 21.5m visitors to Italy's museums, *something in here
(HP) *
down by 1m on 1991. The museums which lost out were mainly free entry, which
despite being splendid, such as the Villa Farnesina in Rome, have impossible
opening hours. The number of paying visitors to museums increased by
500.000.
The figures are not lost on Mr Ronchey. He plans to make under-l8s and
over-60s, who get free museum admission, pay something. He is also
determined Italian museums begin to offer services which are standard
throughout western Europe, such as restaurants, coffee-shops and bookshops.
And he has plans to open the door to private companies to run these
services.
Mr Ronchey's main objective is for the didactic material to be available on
video discs and video casettes, to enable visitors to get a restorer's-eye
view of the newly cleaned frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, or the Piero della
Francesca in San Francesco at Arezzo.
The proceeds of such projects will help the finances of the larger museums,
which are now freer of state controls. Earnings from the smaller museums
will go into a central regional fund, to be re-distributed according to
need. Enterprising competitors for the tenders, such as Ovidio Jacorossi of
Artemesia, are offering package deals to include air-conditioning, security
and restaurant services. The latter have already been provided for Rome's
newest and most comfortable exhibition space - the huge neo-classical
Palazzo Degli Esposizioni.
Mr Ronchey's latest battle is the fiercest, most important and maybe the one
most in danger of being lost. The military has refused to dislodge their
Officer's club from Palazzo Barberini, designated by the Italian government
in l949 as the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica (to hold 12th to l8th
century Italian art). The officers have used this now slightly decaying
billet in central Rome since l934, giving over part of a single floor to one
of the finest art collections in the world.
The gallery is composed of donations from the grand old Italian families,
such as the Corsinis and the Odescalchis, and includes Raphael's 'La
Fornarina', and several Caravaggios, Lorenzo Lottos and Filippo Lippis. Only
300 pieces of the l,500-strong collection can be displayed at any one time,
which the majority languishing in store-rooms.
Mr Ronchey, in his attempts to encourage the military to move out of the
Palazzo Barberini, issued a decree on April 21 to enable a pre-emptive
purchase of the handsome, turn-of-the-century villa on the Nomentana (just
outside the city walls), which was being sold by the state. L28bn was
rapidly raised from the finance ministry, and the defence ministry agreed to
pay restoration costs.
Mr Ronchey had hoped to save this architectural treasure from speculators
and free Palazzo Barberini for the National Gallery. Too simple. The decree,
guaranteeing that the finance ministry put up the money for the villa,
lapsed in mid-June, and although there is a 60-day prorogue the outcome is
in doubt - unless, as Mr Ronchey hopes, now, there is a public outcry. A
second decree has been issued, giving Mr Ronchey until August 21 to persuade
the military to accept his offer.
Some of Italy's long-hidden treasures will, however, be reappearing shortly.
On July 2 the newly-restored Palazzo Massimo opens to the public and Roman
statues and reliefs long hidden in the cellars at the Museum of Roman Art at
the Baths of Diocletion will at last be visible. The third section of the
Museum of Roman Art, based at Palazzo Altemps near Piazza Navona, will open
next summer.
It will house the fine groups of classical statues collected by the Roman
aristocrats in the l6th and l7th centuries, such as the magnificent 97-piece
Ludovisi collection.
Such efforts to make art more visible and the recent cleaning and
restoration work on a cluster of Rome's finest baroque churches, should make
the city a pleasure to visit.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (11): More patience for patients - David
Lane examines the unpopular health service reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH Italians are accustomed to daily trials with officialdom, many have
nevertheless been surprised by the extra hurdles the health service reform
requires them to leap. The De Lorenzo decree, introduced at the end of last
year, sets new bench marks for testing patience, stamina and cunning.
Thoroughly disliked by the public, Mr De Lorenzo's decree has been given
short shrift by the medical profession. 'Chaotic and stupid,' says Mr Benito
Meledandri, vice-president of the Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini dei
Medici (the national medical association). Words of condemnation were
usually stronger among the long queues that formed earlier this year at
local health authorities for 'bollini' (coupons) giving entitlement to free
medicines.
Next month and the following month, about 15m Italians will face another
endurance test devised by former health minister Francesco De Lorenzo. Until
now Italians have been entitled to free access to family doctors. The De
Lorenzo decree has introduced an annual charge of L85,000 a person, payable
by individuals with income of more than L30m, couples with family income of
more than L42m and three-person families with income above L50m. (The income
threshold rises by L5m for every additional family member.)
The method of payment of the tax on general practitioner (GP) services will
probably cause as much complaint as the charge itself. Italy's creaking
bureaucracy is unable to handle modern payment methods such as cheques,
bankers' orders and direct debits. It has to have cash.
Paying the GP tax will mean finding the appropriate giro forms, and there is
a fair chance of an acute shortage of them, and facing interminable queues
at post office counters to pay cash.
In spite of calls to drop the tax, the government is going ahead. Smart
money is on a repeat of the 'bollini' fiasco.
Mr Meledandri says that his association believes that the only way to deal
satisfactorily with the question of financing Italy's national health
service is through general taxation, particularly direct taxation on income.
'We are convinced that those who are fit must pay for those who are sick,
and the wealthy must pay for the poor. Indeed this was the line taken in the
major reorganisation that took place in 1978.
'The De Lorenzo reform seeks the end of the welfare state. His decree was
ideologically based, attempting to abolish public sector health care and
replace it by the private sector.'
It is not surprising that the PDS (Partito Democratico della Sinistra, the
former Communist Party) is also at the barricades. Indeed the doctors and
the PDS are two of many organisations that have collected signatures for a
referendum to abrogate the De Lorenzo decree. And with 850,000 Italians
putting their names to the call for referendum, this will go ahead unless
the government makes the appropriate legislative changes.
The De Lorenzo decree is criticised for being conceptually wrong, poor in
implementation and out of touch with reality. 'We warned that the
introduction of bollini would have a knock-on effect, and this has
happened,' notes Mr Meledandri. Hospitals have experienced a large surge in
admissions by Italians who do not have bollini or whose quota has been used.
Unable or reluctant to pay for medicines and analyses, people are turning to
hospital emergency departments.
This shift of treatment from GPs' surgeries to hospitals leads to higher
costs. Budget minister Luigi Spaventa notes that spending on prescription
pharmaceuticals has fallen sharply this year. (They were 25 per cent lower
in the first quarter.) But hospital costs have soared.
While hospital treatment for minor ailments or for chronic conditions
already being treated by GPs is a misuse of resources, the problem is
exacerbated by a generally low level of hospital efficiency. 'Patients stay
for four or five days when one ought to be enough,' remarks Mr Spaventa.
Mr Meledandri admits that there is inefficiency and waste in the health
service, blaming this on lack of paramedical staff and insufficient
investment. He also admits that the non-medical aspects of hospitals often
fall far short of acceptable standards. 'Lack of clean bed linen, and
inadequate and dirty bathrooms and lavatories are problems. But the patient
can rely on the professionalism of medical staff,' he says.
However, senior cardiologist Bruno Pilato sees non-medical matters as
hampering the work of doctors in hospitals and causing demoralisation. And
professionalism has suffered from poor morale. 'In clear conflict of
interest, doctors have used their positions within the state health service
to further their private practices. In addition to bad management, there has
been dishonesty. There have been numerous cases of equipment being purchased
and never unpacked,' says Mr Pilato.
Given the sums of money spent by Italy's state health service, it is not
surprising that it has been the target for corrupt businessmen and
politicians. 'An example of the party political character of healthcare is
that hospitals have been built and never opened, or opened many years after
construction was completed. Generally delays have been caused by staffing.
Secure public sector jobs are central to the patronage system, and reaching
agreement on beneficiaries can be time consuming,' explains Mr Pilato.
Yet party politics and good health services are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. 'Public services are generally of high standard in Emilia
Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria, Italy's 'red' regions,' notes Mr Pilato.
Indeed, the health service in Italy offers sharp contrasts of good and bad,
of corrupt and honest, of efficient and inefficient, of caring and uncaring,
albeit the negative aspects seem to predominate. Few doubt that
reorganisation is urgently needed to boost professionalism, increase
efficiency and raise standards overall.
However, few believe that the reorganisation introduced by the De Lorenzo
decree meets the needs. The sight of pensioners and the sick condemned to
lengthy queues, in which some failed to reach the front and died while
waiting, suggested that Mr De Lorenzo had failed.
'There is no easy solution,' remarks Mr Meledandri. He points to the
increasing calls on Italy's health services arising from a higher number of
elderly people in the population, and also from the opportunities for better
treatment that are offered by advances in medicine.
Yet at the same time Italy is having to tackle a critical situation in its
public sector finances. There is no scope for open-handedness. On the
contrary, austerity requires that spending be kept rigorously in check.
Mr Meledandri considers that more resources should be allocated. 'Only 6.5
per cent of GDP is spent on health care in Italy. This is too low,' he
states. But it is hard to see that such calls for higher spending will be
satisfied. Cuts in resources are more likely, together with higher
contributions from the public. And in this respect the De Lorenzo decree has
shown the way.
There is scope for better value for money, and this must be an objective if
Mr De Lorenzo's successor, Maria Pia Garavaglia, wants to avoid the
criticism that service cuts and higher charges bring. The reduction of local
health authorities from the present number of 640 to about 100 (one per
province) may help. 'But the risk of political interference still exists in
the local health authorities,' warns Mr Meledandri.
In preparing her reorganisation, Mrs Garavaglia must try to reconcile
conflicting factors, and to allay concerns about a shift in health care from
public sector towards private. The debate has been lit by the De Lorenzo
decree. 'Health is a hot issue,' says Mr Spaventa. The coming GP tax will
keep the temperature high.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (9): Pride of a nation damaged by tagenti -
Corruption has been unearthed on a truly vast scale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORD tagentopoli has become deeply embedded in the national
consciousness in a remarkably short time.
Tagenti are bribes, and when the corruption scandals first began to break in
Milan 16 months ago the city was dubbed tagentopolis. But as the scandals
spread throughout Italy, the polis turned plural to tagentopoli. The
expression is now short-hand both for the investigations into corruption as
well as the system of corruption itself.
Corruption has been unearthed on a truly vast scale. Without exaggeration
virtually every institution of state is either implicated or risks being
implicated. Few public figures are untainted. In Milan alone 800 persons
have been caught up in the investigations and 111 have already passed
through the courts. More than 105 members of parliament are directly
affected and risk incrimination.
The pride of Italian industry has been dragged in, damaging the image of
private groups such as Fiat and Olivetti or state companies such as IRI, the
main holding company, Eni, the oil concern, and Enel, the electricity
authority. Bribes are revealed to have been paid on anything from minor
pharmaceutical supply contracts to theatres, railway carriages, power
stations, football stadiums and waste treatment plants.
The total amount of money involved has been estimated at L5,000bn a year.
But this is merely a guestimate by analysts examining the size of public
sector contracts awarded annually and then factoring in revelations on the
percentages demanded by the politicians and their henchmen. Contracts in the
telecommunications sector involved 2 per cent of the total value. Power
station contracts carried percentages of up to 3 per cent.
But it is now clear the combination of contractors paying bribes and the
authorities accepting rigged bids added considerably to public expenditure.
From the late Eighties the majority of projects were costing between 15 and
20 per cent more than was necessary. Indeed, this month in Milan a municipal
construction tender was bid 50 per cent below the rate prevailing before the
corruption scandals broke in February 1992.
Overall, according to the calculations of one research institute, the
elaborate system of bribes was latterly costing the country L15,000bn a year
in extra expenditure and the extra cost of borrowing to cover the spending.
Such figures may overstate the cost, but they nevertheless convey a sense of
the scale of corruption and the extent to which it came to burden the
economy. It is also abundantly clear that during the Eighties corruption
became systematic. The main political parties placed their trusted
'collectors' or executives throughout the state apparatus to ensure that
funds were diverted to their coffers - and towards their own pockets. The
degree of personal enrichment has been substantial.
Those who have confessed to taking bribes freely concede that as much as 60
per cent of all monies collected ended up in the bank accounts of
individuals. Perhaps it is no accident that all the main parties have
serious deficits. The worst deficit is that of the Socialists, regarded as
the most avaricious, with a staggering L214bn plus a further L30bn
outstanding in local sections. If the money had been channelled solely to
the party, the deficit could never have been so high.
The funds illicitly obtained in the name of the main political parties have
come in several different forms. Normally businessmen have handed over money
to the politicians and their bagmen in return for winning contracts in the
public sector. These contracts have been awarded by state agencies such as
Anas, the roads authority, utilities such as Enel or by municipal
authorities in such spheres as transport, health and waste treatment.
Alternatively, state companies have been deliberately 'milked'. Their
political masters obliged these companies to make contributions. Usually
this was through foreign operations. The most significant case has been the
illicit funding by Eni, the state oil concern and its subsidiaries. Last
month Saipem, Eni's pipeline subsidiary, revealed that since 1987 it had
paid out L225bn in bribes and commissions to Italian and foreign
intermediaries, most of this via a friendly Swiss banking institution.
Contributions have also been made in the form of indirect transfers such as
support for politicians' pet projects, political meetings and advertising
campaigns.
There are also instances of deliberate agreements between the politicians,
local authorities, the public administration and companies to defraud the
exchequer. This has especially been the case in southern Italy. Here the
most flagrant example has been the misuse of the huge sums of money
available for reconstruction after the I980 Irpinia earthquake near Naples.
Other instances include the construction programme for the 1990 World Cup
football competition and deals to inflate expenditure or carry out
unnecessary projects.
The practice of concert party deals between politicians, businessmen and
officials agreeing to defraud the state has arguably been the most damaging
aspect of the corruption scandals on the public accounts. But equally, there
have been cases of one public company agreeing to pay a bribe to another to
obtain a contract, while the illicit monies are shared among the
politicians.
The share-out has usually been on the basis of the party's proportion of the
national vote or their respective weight inside the government. Minor
coalition partners such as the Liberals and Social Democrats obtained
illicit finance wholly disproportionate to their share of the vote simply
because they were in government. But the lion's share has gone to the
Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the dominant coalition parties. The
opposition, too, in the form of the old Communist Party and its successor
the Party of the Democratic Left(PDS), was frequently co-opted, normally by
a deal to offer a proportion of contracts to their co-operatives.
The inquiries have acquired a momentum of their own as the magistrates
establish inter-locking threads and the exploit of the system of plea
bargaining. Basically people are arrested and imprisoned until they accept
to talk. The information thus gathered has been selectively released by the
magistrates breaking most norms of justice intended to protect an
individual's innocence.
Nevertheless, this practice has achieved its aim of discrediting the
political establishment which proceeded to occupy and rape the state for its
own selfish needs in the post-war era. It has also unmasked the mechanics of
corruption which cannot easily be reproduced on the same scale in the short
or even medium term. Arguably such objectives lay behind the Milan
magistrates' drive to uproot corruption in the city.
The investigative phase of tagentopoli will soon play second fiddle to other
issues as the process moves towards the courts. For instance, is the
judicial system equipped to cope with trying so many people? Is it realistic
to consider an amnesty as the practices unmasked relate essentially to a
vanishing political system?
A case can take up to 10 years to complete its slow path through the full
array of courts. Equally, such is the morass of contradictory legislation
that the prosecution fails in 75 per cent of all cases. Simplified
procedures may well be introduced to despatch the cases of those who have
pleaded guilty and have agreed to co-operate with justice. But with the
politicians who are contesting charges, especially the serious one of
extortion (ie forcing businessmen to pay bribes against the threat of not
obtaining contracts), quick trials are not proving so easy to contemplate.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (10): Moves on Mafia may be costly -
Organised crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS

<TEXT>
ITALIAN authorities have, in the past 12 months, registered an unprecedented
series of successes against the Mafia. Unprecedented because, in spite of
countless ritual declarations of war by successive Italian governments, no
real offensive against Cosa Nostra had ever before been launched.
If the war against the Mafia is now being fought in fact and not just in
words, there are two main reasons. One is the upsurge in popular feeling
following the assassinations of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino
last summer. The other is the eclipse - in part the consequence of
elections, in part that of tangentopoli (corruption) - of the oligarchy that
has held power in Italy since the war.
The arrest this year of Toto Riina, head of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella
organisation of the Sicilian Mafia, of Benedetto (Nitto) Santapaola, second
in command, and the fact that dozens of other pezzi da novanta are now
behind bars, are all clear evidence of the profound change that has taken
place.
It would have been unthinkable and in effect impossible a year ago. Riina
and Santapaola, the two most wanted men in Italy, had, for more than a
decade, been leading outwardly normal lives close to their homes. Only
powerful political protection could have enabled them to do so.
Former premier Senator Giulio Andreotti, and former interior minister
Antonio Gava, are under investigation for collusion with the Mafia and the
Neapolitan Camorra respectively. Whether or not these two men face charges
is, of course, up to the prosecutors.
What is clear, however, is that the growth of organised crime in Italy to
the point where it effectively controlled the governments of four of the
country's regions, holding sway over the lives of 12m people in southern
Italy - and the simultaneous spread of the Mafia's tentacles over large
sectors of the national economy - would not have been possible without
political connivance.
The story of how this 'unholy alliance' operated largely remains to be told,
but the outlines are already apparent. It will tell of a super tangentopolis
involving not only corrupt politicians and businessmen but, in addition,
Mafiosi, Freemasons and spies.
Over the past 30 years, the Italian government has channeled L200,000bn to
promote the development of the country's backward south. How far, if at all,
this objective has in fact been achieved is a matter of some controversy. It
is estimated, however, that some 15 per cent of this has gone into the
Mafia's pockets. Says Pino Arlacchi, professor of sociology at Florence
university and one of the country's leading experts on organised crime:
'Italy's are the only criminal organisations in the world to be largely
financed by the government.'
The March 12, 1992, shooting of Salvo Lima, a prominent Sicilian Christian
Democrat close to Andreotti, signalled the breakdown of the shadowy links
between politicians and Mafiosi which grew up during the cold war. According
to Mafia justice collaborators the murder was retribution for the
politicians' failure to honour a promise that the supreme court would quash
a series of convictions against the bosses in the so-called maxitrial of
more than 700 Mafiosi.
This might have been feasible in the past - Italy's supreme court was, at
one point, almost routinely reversing anti-Mafia verdicts issued at assizes
and appeals level. But, with the wind of change already blowing strong,
there was no way it could be done in January last year.
The murders of Falcone and Borsellino followed, and, then the war that
should have been fought 20 years ago began in earnest. In the past 18
months, police have arrested 5,793 Mafiosi, including 70 ranking bosses.
Availing themselves of new laws on the seizure of assets, the authorities
have confiscated more than L4,500bn in property, bonds and cash. The
governing councils of more than 60 Italian towns have been disbanded after
being found heavily infiltrated by the Mafia.
Today, most of the Mafia's most fearsome bosses are behind bars, as are the
leaders of the Camorra and the Calabrian 'n'drangheta.
But the recent car bombs in Rome and Florence have also shown - as intended
 -that it still retains a dangerous capacity to plan and organise
terrorist-style operations.
With 17,000 'regulars' each of them flanked by roughly 30 sympathisers or
accomplices, the Mafia is a highly diversified organisation which can count
on a nationwide workforce of roughly 500,000 people. It will, according to
Luciano Violante, chairman of Italy's standing parliamentary committee on
the Mafia, take another six to seven years before it can be completely
destroyed.
Moreover, the Mafia's very considerable financial and economic interests
have, in spite of the seizure of billions of lira's worth of assets,
remained largely intact. According to the Italian National Statistics
institute, organised crime in this country grosses some L26,000 bn a year,
which would make it Italy's fifth largest corporation.
Just how much of the Mafia's illicit profits are invested in legal
activities is a matter of debate, especially as the dividing line between
investments and laundering or recycling is blurred. However, according to
Colonel Francesco Petracca, of the Guardia di Finanza, 60 per cent of the
Mafia's investments go into the financial sector, 17 per cent into real
estate, 11 per cent into the retail trade and 4 per cent into industry.
Despite the introduction of a series of safeguards against recycling, the
Italian banking system is still regarded as wide open to Mafia money.
Treasury bonds merit a chapter apart. According to Franco Piro, former
chairman of the parliamentary committee on finance, Mafiosi may be buying
some L10,000bn of government paper every year, significantly helping to
finance government spending and shore up the national debt.
All this poses an interesting question. The Italian government finally seems
determined to eliminate the Mafia. But can it really afford to?

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (7): Progress at a snail's pace - Haig
Simonian monitors the ambitious privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 10 months ago, Italy's government surprised the stock market, foreign
multinationals and many of its supporters by announcing an ambitious
privatisation programme for the next three years.
Since then, Bonn has put forward plans to sell off state assets, London is
going ahead with the disposal of the remaining stake in British Telecom,
while the new French government has knocked the wind out of investors with
the speed and scope of its privatisation plans.
Italy, in the meantime, has appeared to stand still. The same companies are
still for sale; timetables, which looked ambitious to begin with, are
regularly repeated but never revised; only ministers' faces have changed.
What has gone wrong?
The delays involve party politics, economic fundamentals, and just plain
donkey work. The upshot is that, although some deals are approaching
conclusion, many more are barely on the starting line.
However, the impression of inactivity masks some genuine progress. The
previous government of prime minister Giuliano Amato, which set the
privatisation ball rolling, made a start on overcoming many of the toughest,
but least visible, obstacles to disposals.
Foremost among them was political consensus. While the need to sell assets
to bring down the budget deficit was widely accepted in the government and
ministers were broadly agreed that privatisation was one instrument in going
about it, consensus ended there.
Opposition to disposals took two forms - the second sometimes masquerading
as the first. Some ministers, notably Mr Giuseppe Guarino, who held the key
industry portfolio, argued privatisation should be prepared in the context
of a broader 'industrial policy' for the state.
Some companies on the privatisation list, such as Finmeccanica, the
engineering arm of the IRI state holding company, have huge investment
programmes entailing long lags before profits start to show. The risk of
privatisation, according to the critics, was that essential, but potentially
unattractive, long-term investments or research projects, vital to keeping
Italy abreast in the high-technology race, might be pruned by new
private-sector owners. Rather than pushing ahead with piecemeal
privatisations, they argued the government should first work out a list of
strategic priorities.
The second barrier to sell-offs was much more self-centred. State-sector
companies have been important sources of political patronage for decades.
Their boards have been stacked with political placement. As the corruption
scandal shows, some were also crucial milk cows for the political parties.
Such territory is not easily relinquished by politicians accustomed to
treating the symbiosis between parties and state enterprises as a fact of
political life.
Mr Amato also had to overcome organisational difficulties. Big
privatisations require months of groundwork by lawyers, bankers and
accountants. Some laws also had to be changed to eliminate monopolies and
alter tariff structures. And the legal status of the biggest public-sector
concerns also had to be amended.
Hence the privatisation of IRI, Eni (energy and chemicals), Ina (insurance)
or Enel (electricity generating) could not advance until all were
transformed into joint stock companies, producing normal balance sheets and
with an arm's-length relationship to the state.
The completion of much of the groundwork by Mr Amato and the presence of a
more homogeneous team of ministers under Mr Cimapi means disposals should
now gather speed. Few doubt Mr Ciampi's determination, unequivocably
expressed in speeches on cutting the deficit during his term as central bank
governor.
Political opposition has also diminished as many MPs have become discredited
by the corruption scandals. Meanwhile, pro-privatisation parties, such as
the Northern Leagues, have been gathering strength.
The process has also been helped by the progressive 'de-politicisation' of
the big state companies, reducing internal resistance. Boards of directors
have been slimmed down for faster decision-making. Revelations about the
payment of kickbacks has made the management renewal process faster and less
painful than expected.
Most of the delays are now market-related rather than political. Recession
has eroded the number of buyers for many assets. Mr Franco Bernabe, Eni's
managing director, has recognised disposals are likely to be easiest when
limited to small companies or plants, rather than wholesale divisions. As a
result, leading newspapers have been peppered with modest advertisements,
rather than full-page blockbusters, offering individual Eni units for sale.
Falling earnings have also dulled the attractions of many big state-owned
banks and companies. Italy's financial institutions, once avidly courted by
big foreign banks wanting to expand abroad, have lost much of their lustre
now that profits are down.
Changing corporate priorities have not helped. The focus among banks on
cross-border financial services in the run-up to the European Community's
1992 liberalisation prompted a scramble to buy financial services companies
in neighbouring countries. Little was for sale in Italy at the time. Now the
supply has increased, but demand has withered as bankers have realised
managing financial services abroad is no easy matter.
Luck also plays a part. Some disposals, such as the treasury's stake in the
Crediop long-term lending agency to the San Paolo banking group, went
through smoothly before Mr Amato came to power.
By contrast, talks to sell the treasury-controlled IMI financial services
group to a pool of big city savings banks fell through this month, nearly
three years after first being mooted. The sale of the banks, led by Milan's
Cariplo, was forecast to raise about L3,500bn. Now, plans for IMI will have
to be revised, with the treasury envisaging a flotation instead.
To cap it all, Italian business remains overshadowed by the corruption
scandal. Many foreign buyers are keenly aware of the prospects in retailing
or insurance. But most are hanging back until the corruption scandal dies
down.
Domestic constraints must also be tackled for privatisation to proceed
smoothly. The Milan stock market remains relatively small and illiquid,
despite recent financial reforms. The lack of potential domestic investors
has made ministers, fearing a flop, wary of big flotations for the first,
pace-setting privatisations.
Both the Amato and Ciampi governments must take some of the blame for not
doing more to develop the bourse as part of the overall privatisation
process.
Most recently, the government approved a proposal by the Bank of Italy to
allow banks to buy up to 15 per cent of the shares of industrial companies
in an important revision of the outdated 1936 banking law. Although easing
the privatisation process was not the main motive, letting banks buy into
public-sector companies due to be sold was undoubtedly an influence on
policy-makers.
For its critics, however, the proposal represented nothing more than a
veiled 'nationalisation'. The banking system is dominated by public-sector
institutions, which may end up taking significant stakes in state-owned
companies now being 'privatised'. Such an approach was understandably
derided by those calling for a 'true' privatisation policy.
In fact, the main reason for the reform was to ease debt problems among
private-sector companies suffering in the recession. But given the
apparently snail's pace of Italy's privatisation programme, the cynical
reaction was not altogether surprising.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (5): Hopes for a modest recovery - After a
tough budget, Robert Graham analyses the economic slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CIAMPI government is hoping the economy will begin to shake off
recession in the last quarter of the year, and will witness a modest
recovery in 1994. Such an assumption could be optimistic.
With the economies of Italy's main partners sluggish, there are limits on
the advantage exporters can exploit from a heavily devalued lira. At home,
the climate will be strongly influenced by the continued need for a tough
adjustment programme to remain in force throughout 1994 to reduce the public
sector deficit to the levels of its EC partners. This year's budget has been
one of the toughest in the post-war era, depressing domestic demand and
forcing the first drop in private consumption in 40 years.
Growth during the current year is unlikely to be more than 0.3 per cent.
This compares with 0.9 per cent in 1991. The economy formally entered
recession in the third quarter of 1992. Nevertheless, the slowdown had been
in evidence since late 1991.
The extent of the slowdown was masked by the way in which public spending
was boosted in the first half of 1992 for electoral reasons. This spending
merely delayed the arrival of recession which had already hit Italy's main
trading partners. For a while Italians even had the illusion their economy
might be able to ride out what promised to a dip in the production cycle.
But such an illusion underestimated the accumulated size of the public
sector deficit, which by last year had reached more than 10.5 per cent of
GDP. The currency crisis of last September, which savaged Italy's reserves
and forced the lira to float outside the European Monetary System (EMS),
inculcated a sense of reality among the politicians.
As a result the Amato government was able to force through a tough 1993
budget and an accompanying series of structural reforms. The budget sought
to raise L93,000bn in extra revenues and spending cuts to hold the public
sector deficit down to L150,000bn. The new fiscal measures included
increased property taxes, stamp duties, and a generous tax amnesty to recoup
unpaid taxes over the previous five years. The spending cuts covered
limiting public sector wages to below inflation and ceilings on local
government transfers.
The Amato government also introduced the concept of a 'minimum' tax in
arguably the first serious attempt to crack down on tax evasion. The finance
ministry drew up notional average earnings for specific jobs and then
applied tax demands on such a notional base - a move intended to catch
especially those in the professions who have been notorious for
under-declaring their incomes.
The other novelty in 1993 budget was the structural reforms which provide
for savings in subsequent years on a cumulative basis. These reforms covered
changes in the generous system of pensions, a shake-up of the national
health, tighter controls over government transfers to the regions and local
authorities, and reform of the civil service.
Pensions in particular have come to be a huge burden on the budget. If the
system had been left unchanged, the entire budget threatened to be taken up
with covering pension payments in under 30 years. The reforms raise
gradually the retirement age from 55 to 60 for women and from 60 to 65 for
men. Limits are also placed on the size of benefits available to public
sector employees.
The health system is also in the process of being changed, with hospitals
placed under professional management, the greater availability of private
medicine, and medicines being no longer free for all on prescription. These
changes in the nature of the welfare state should bring significant
long-term savings, although on the pensions side future governments may have
to introduce even more restrictive legislation.
Public finances should also be helped by allowing greater autonomy to local
authorities to raise revenue and to control expenditure. Until this year
local authorities simply received transfers from the central government
without any sanction for over-spending or premium for good management. Now
local authorities will have their central government transfers capped but
they will be able to raise a share of property taxes, impose their own car
taxes and have at their disposal several other fiscal devices. This, coupled
with tight control over new hirings in the civil service, and greater job
accountability in the public sector, should provide savings.
Despite these positive attempts to introduce structural change, instead of
mere temporary palliatives, the budget deficit remains difficult to control.
As a result of the recession the tax take has declined, eroding the chances
of sustaining a primary surplus without corrective measures. Recession also
puts pressure on the government to expand unemployment benefits or spend on
job creation. Already the Ciampi government has been obliged to carry out a
mini-budget in mid-May (foreshadowed by its predecessors) raising L12,500bn
in new taxes and spending cuts. The mini-budget is still being discussed and
could undergo some modification - although the overall amount to be raised
will not be changed.
The public sector deficit should thus be held down to L155,000bn, in line
with promises made to the EC earlier in the year when an ECU8bn loan was
contracted. But the government will have to find a further L45,000bn or more
in the 1994 budget. Only with such a continued adjustment can spending be
controlled and the deficit gradually rolled back towards the 1994 target of
8.4 per cent of GDP.
If interest rates can be reduced, the pressure will be further alleviated.
At present interest on the debt is almost equivalent to the budget deficit;
while the debt itself is more than 104 per cent of GDP, well above the 60
per cent ceiling set in the Maastricht Treaty criteria. Each one percentage
point movement in interest rates adds or detracts more than L13,000bn in a
full year to debt service.
Following Italy's exit from the EMS in September last year, the Bank of
Italy has been able to steadily reduce the discount rate. From the September
crisis high of 15 per cent, it was down to 10 per cent by mid-June, and
commercial rates have also fallen accordingly. However, real rates remain
high in European terms since inflation is running at just over 4 per cent on
an annual basis. The authorities are still caught in the dilemma of having
to retain interest rates attractively high to encourage purchasers of
treasury bills which finance the huge debt.
So far inflation appears to have been kept under control. The heavy
devaluation against the dollar and D-Mark, the main traded currencies,
occurred at a time of depressed domestic demand and importers have kept
prices down. But it is questionable how long the economy can remain immune
from the effects of a 25 per cent devaluation. Economists predict that
year-end inflation could be running at around 5.7 per cent on an annualised
basis.
Manufactures have been able to hold prices down because they have cut
margins and wage costs have been almost two percentage points below
inflation. The latter has been due to a pact between the unions, employers
and government last July ending inflation-indexed pay (the so-called scala
mobile). The continuance of such a pact will be vital to domestic costs and
inflationary pressures as a whole.
The agreement is due to be renewed at the latest by next month. The unions
are seeking a limited re-introduction of wage indexation; but in the end
they will play job security above wages. Over the past year some 200,000
jobs have been lost in industry and unemployment as a whole has risen to
more than 10.5 per cent of the workforce. This understates the picture since
a large number of workers in industry are covered by temporary lay-off
schemes, funded mainly by the government. As these schemes exhaust their
two-year statutory limits, the jobless could rise to more than 12 per cent
by 1994.
The bright spot in the economy has undoubtedly been the devaluation induced
surge in exports. Italian industry has been able to compensate at least in
part for declining domestic demand through an aggressive export performance.
Overall exports are expected to increase by 7 per cent in real terms this
year, perhaps more; while imports are projected to decline by 1.5 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (8): Voters call for a new administration -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIANS enjoy a privilege offered to few electorates; the power to abolish
government departments. And they exercised it in April when the score from
the referendum ballot box was a resounding 3-0 against the ministries.
The ministry of agriculture was one of the losers, some 54 per cent of the
electorate voting that it should be closed. In a turnout of 77 per cent, 70
per cent voted that the ministry's powers should pass to Italy's regional
authorities.
The referendum campaign was led by the regional authorities of the Alto
Adige, Piedmont, Lombardy, the Trentino, the Veneto, Emilia Romagna,
Tuscany, the Marches, Umbria and Basilicata. (With the exception of
Basilicata, all are wealthy northern or central regions.) The opposition
line-up included all the main farmers' and agricultural organisations.
Immediate closure of the ministry would be difficult, and the government has
been able to delay implementation of the electorate's verdict until August
4. In the meantime, an effort is being made to establish a new framework for
administering agriculture. 'We are working towards the creation of a new
ministry which will be the ministry of agricultural, food and forestry
resources,' states Alfredo Diana, the minister of agriculture.
In setting up a new organisation that bows to the will expressed by the
electorate in April, the government is having to perform a delicate
philological and constitutional balancing act.
'Though the timescale is short, the deadline is absolutely inflexible,' says
Mr Diana. 'Draft legislation has been prepared and is now being discussed.
The main issue is to decide which activities should be transferred to the
regions.' He believes that the responsibility of the state is essentially
that of planning and co-ordinating policy for the sector.
'Land improvements and reclamation ought to pass to the regional
authorities. Responsibility for co-operation should be centred on the
regions, and so also should interest rate assistance. A large part of
activity will be decentralised. I envisage that the regions will have the
task of managing agricultural policy,' says Mr Diana.
One certainty is that Italy will not be represented in EC negotiations by 20
regional agricultural assessors. Eurocrats and Italy's community partners
will not be treated to a Babel of Italian regional dialects or heated Latin
demonstrations of differences on policy and how agricultural funds should be
divided.
'There will be no change in our presence in Brussels,' says Mr Diana, noting
that national responsibilities are indicated by the Treaty of Rome. He
points out that federal administrative structures in Germany and Belgium do
not prevent single national representation in EC discussions.
'The responsibility of overseeing the application of EC policy definitely
belongs to the state. The agreement that we recently reached on milk quotas
is conditional on control being exercised by the state. The 173,000
registered letters to Italian milk producers dealing with quotas were from
AIMA, a ministry agency. Almost 700,000 sowing declarations are being
handled by the ministry, as the body responsible towards the EC.'
At least 30 per cent of the ministry's 2,200 jobs will go in the shake-up.
Mr Diana admits that there will problems, but believes that the changes can
be achieved without trauma. Employment security is not at risk. Nobody will
be fired.
Though amalgamation of departments generally leads to fewer jobs, it is hard
to believe that Mr Diana's ideas for bringing the ministry's 23 research
institutions under one roof will not lead to job creation. And the state
agency for market intervention, AIMA, ought to offer openings to some of the
civil servants whose jobs at the ministry will disappear. 'It is absolutely
necessary that AIMA should establish an inspection service, and this will
require staffing.'
Another source of new jobs will be in the food sector, if Mr Diana's plans
for re-defining the ministry's fields of competence are extended in this
direction. 'The food industry would welcome closer links with agriculture.
The new ministry ought to cover food as well as agriculture,' he says,
foreseeing the acquisition of new and different responsibilities.
The position of the Corpo Forestale di Stato, Italy's 7,000-strong force of
forest rangers, is also under discussion. Mr Diana believes that the nature
of its work, which includes fire-fighting and protection of national parks,
is such that it should pass to the environment ministry. 'But some members
want to keep police status and would prefer that the Corpo Forestale should
be part of the internal affairs ministry.' Mr Diana dismisses the idea that
the Corpo Forestale's job could be devolved to the regions.
Italy's minister of agriculture and his staff are clearly more than usually
busy. Although heavily engaged in discussions on transferring
responsibilities to the regional authorities and transforming the central
organisation, the ministry has continued its efforts to put Italy's case in
international forums. In mid-June Italy presented two position statements;
to the council of agricultural ministers, one on the Uruguay Round and the
other on Common Agricultural Policy reform.
Mr Diana emphasises Italy's objective of obtaining Gatt agreement as soon as
possible. He is concerned, however, that the Blair House agreement risks
affecting some sectors adversely. Mediterranean products such as wine, olive
oil and fruit and vegetables are an area where Italy seeks a favourable
response before accepting Blair House. 'They have never been a source of
contention on international markets, and external protection and internal
support have declined to negligible levels,' says Mr Diana.
Closer to home, Italy has concerns about CAP reform, complaining about
complex mechanisms and the consequences of errors and omissions by farmers.
'The experience of applying the reform has shown the need for significant
changes in the system, from both an organisational and regulatory point of
view,' says Mr Diana. But given Italy's record in terms of CAP fraud, it is
hard to see EC partners accepting an easing of regulatory constraints where
these help combat fraudsters.
Mr Diana complains about quotas and that Italy is being put in a
straitjacket. 'Only countries that have already reached satisfactory
production levels find quotas acceptable. Italian farmers are reluctant to
submit weakly to measures that bestow advantages to agriculture in northern
EC member states.'
The farming lobby in Italy is numerically strong. Latest statistics show 3m
farms and an agricultural workforce of 2.1m. But the problem of small-scale
farming has not been solved by co-operation. 'Perhaps too much emphasis has
been given to this form of activity. Lack of funds would prevent such
support today,' says Mr Diana, noting that this will soon be a regional
responsibility.
He considers that the collapse of Federconsorzi, an event two years ago that
laid open malpractice and maladministration and created much discontent
among foreign bank creditors, is a loss to the agricultural sector. 'It was
very useful to small farmers for storage and the sale of products,' says Mr
Diana.
In addition to fragmentation, Italian agriculture is characterised by
substantial regional differences. Farmers in the north are closer to their
counterparts in north European countries, technologically, culturally,
economically and geographically, than to fellow Italian farmers in the
south.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (2): The old makes way for the new - After
the corruption scandals, Robert Graham looks at the new politicians at the
top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S political class has been decapitated during the past year as a
result of the corruption scandals.
Foundering with the discredited politicians are the parties they have
represented. The long-ruling Christian Democrats have become a shadow of
their former self. The 100-year-old Socialist Party risks dismemberment,
while the other two government partners, the Social Democrats and Liberals,
are in danger of extinction. All four parties have changed their leaders
within the past nine months.
The only new force to have established solid roots is the populist Lombard
League, which is dominant throughout northern Italy. To a lesser extent The
Network (La Rete), the Sicily-based cleansed government movement, also
deserves credit for breaking the mould. The Network is a recycled version of
the left wing of the Christian Democrat Party. Such recycling is scarcely
surprising because a new political class in a democracy inevitably builds on
the old.
In this highly fluid situation Italy could either move towards two or three
large parties/alliances, or retain the large number of parties which would
coalesce on specific issues. In either event commentators agree that it will
take probably two more general elections for the political landscape to
settle.
At present there appears to be a move towards a greater concentration of
regional power, local politics taking precedence over national issues.
Certainly this is the superficial interpretation of the results of the June
municipal elections, which is the most recent gauge of electoral sentiment.
The vote went broadly on regional lines: the League took the north
consolidating its position as the largest single party by a factor of three
to one; the former communists, Party of the Democratic Left (PDS),
reaffirmed and increased its control of the Centre of Italy (the old 'red
belt' in Emilia Romana, Liguria, Le Marche, Tuscany, Umbria and parts of
Lazio) while the Christian Democrats remained strong in the south with the
neo-fascist MSI also doing well.
But this crude split ignores the way in which the PDS has also improved its
position in the south and clung on in the north to remain a significant
national force. The degree of future regionalism also depends on whether the
Christian Democrats can recover their national vote.
The three-way division of the country reflects in broad terms differing
political evolution. The rise of the League in northern Italy has been a
direct response to a feeling that the traditional parties in Rome ignored
the problems of the industrial north, using the region's wealth to fund
corrupt government in Rome and an inefficient welfare state in the south.
Rather than being separatist, or even autonomist, the League represented a
kind of northern nationalism, appealing across party lines.
The League has drawn its support as much from industrial workers anxious to
protect jobs, as from small businessmen and the professional classes. Within
the League, there are overtones of xenophobia both towards the south and
towards immigrants, and some of the language of Umberto Bossi, the leader,
is vulgar and inflammatory. But the base appears to vote with its feet
firmly on the ground, wanting to get value for money from taxes, and be able
to control their own regional affairs.
Having won the mayoralty in Milan and 15 other cities in the north, the
League has a chance to prove itself in local administration. But beyond
this, Mr Bossi must decide in the future whether the League is a regional
movement or a national one. At present it operates as a series of regional
federations and formally calls itself the Northern League.
Mr Bossi must also decide whether as a regional force, the League will win
more concessions in opposition or by joining the government. Mr Bossi is
classified by commentators as being on the right, and it is significant that
alone of the parties (save the neo-fascist MSI) the League chose to fight
the municipal elections without any alliance.
The League's continued success will determine the fate of the Christian
Democrats in the north since it has been mainly at their expense.
Significantly, in the north the first genuine attempts to revamp the
Christian Democrats are occurring, led by the formidable female politician
from the Veneto, Rosy Bindi. In the south, nothing has been done largely
because no alternative other than The Network in Sicily has appeared.
The Christian Democrats are profoundly demoralised and have yet to come to
terms with having lost their position controlling the levers of political
power. The old guard - the Andreottis, Gavas, Forlanis, Pomicinos and De
Mitas - who ran their factions and behaved like feudal barons, have been
damaged beyond repair by the corruption scandals. But they have also done a
considerable disservice by refusing to countenance a thorough cleansing of
the party.
The longer this cleansing is delayed, the more the Christian Democrats risk
being unable to halt their decline. The church appears no longer willing to
offer unconditional support to the party; yet it is precisely in Catholic
values that the Christian Democrats are seeking renewal. Mr Mario Segni, the
leader of the referendum movement, decided to leave the party in March. He
may yet realise he can achieve more as a reformer inside the party.
The Socialists have been the biggest losers from the corruption scandals -
even though they have a mere 39 deputies implicated against the Christian
Democrats' 48. This is because so much of the public odium has fallen on
Bettino Craxi, who resigned in February from the Socialist leadership. He
has come to symbolise the worst aspects of the 'partitiocracy' - the control
of the state apparatus by the ruling parties.
With such a personalised leadership for more than a decade, Mr Craxi's
departure amid a welter of recrimination has left a huge gap. Mr Craxi
cleverly spear-headed an anti-communist alliance with the Christian
Democrats; with the collapse of the Berlin wall the two partners exposed the
two parties' ideological bankruptcy.
The Socialists' future is further clouded by their disastrous financial
position. The party has accumulated debts of L214bn, a further L30bn in
debts of regional offices and a similar amount accrued by the daily, Avanti.
With public funding of political parties banned by the April referendum, the
Socialists are pruning staff and selling assets.
Illicit funding of the parties has been the central issue in the corruption
scandals. The drying up of this source of money, plus the ending of state
subsidies, will have a radical effect on the way parties behave. All
bureaucracies will have to be slimmer and the practice of running
loss-making daily papers could end.
The PDS was one of the first to make cuts in its organisation. This was
forced by the decision to drop the communist label and become social
democrats. (As of this year the PDS is part of the Socialist International).
The old party split, the bulk forming the PDS and the hardline rump,
Reconstituted Communism.
Between them their vote remains remarkably close to 26 per cent enjoyed
before their divorce. The PDS accounts for two thirds nationwide but in some
northern cities has been overtaken by Reconstituted Communism. The
faithfulness of the old communist party vote bears increasingly less
relation to ideology. The appeal is a mixture of a sentimental attachment
and a belief that this grouping represents an honest alternative.
The PDS suffers from serious internal divisions but Achille Occhetto's
leadership has been boosted by the municipal election results which saw PDS
and its allies win 73 of the 145 mayoralties. The PDS needs to move away
from its mind-set as a party of the opposition. The party's three ministers
lasted only 10 hours in the Ciampi cabinet before they were withdrawn in
what with hindsight looks like a frivolous protest.
Formally it was in protest at being associated with a government whose
partners appeared to back parliament in blocking attempts by the judiciary
to make Mr Craxi face corruption charges. However, the Ciampi government
itself had nothing to do with the Craxi affair and Mr Occhetto was merely
thankful to find an excuse to head off criticism for having let his men join
the cabinet.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (3): An experiment in voting / A look at the
sweeping electoral reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE next election, Italians will be experimenting with a new system based
on the principle of majority voting but balanced by proportional
representation.
The historic change came earlier this month when the chamber of deputies
began debating proposals for electoral reform. Ironically, the Italians have
decided to reject their system of proportional representation, introduced
with the post-war constitution, at a time when other European countries are
beginning to have doubts about the merits of majority voting.
The Italian argument for electoral change, however, is powerful. Politicians
from across the political spectrum have reluctantly come to recognise that
the existing system of proportional representation provides too great a
guarantee to small parties and encourages fragmentation. In consequence the
system has fostered unstable coalitions (the Ciampi government is the 52nd
since 1945) yet failed to offer a genuine change of government in elections.
The Christian Democrats have thus ruled throughout the post-war era and
relied on four alternating or contemporaneous allies - the Socialists,
Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans. All the latter have enjoyed a
degree of power and influence over the institutions of state out of all
proportion to their share of the vote.
The pressure for reform has not come from within parliament, as the bulk of
the politicians have profited from the existing system. Instead it has come
from a small group of reformist politicians using the instrument of a
referendum. The first step was the June 1991 referendum endorsing an end to
the practice of multi-preference voting - a practice heavily abused to stack
the odds in favour of machine-backed politicians.
The fragmentation of the political scene in the wake of the April 4, 1992
general elections brought home the fact that the old system had reached the
limits of viability. No fewer than 16 parties were represented in parliament
and half had less than six per cent each of the vote, and only one more than
20 per cent. Pushed by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, a 60-person joint
parliamentary commission was formed in October 1992 to draw up proposals on
constitutional reform, with specific reference to new electoral laws.
The existence of this committee, no matter how slowly it moved initially,
signalled that parliament was serious after years of indifference. Even so,
the pace and agenda of the commission was dictated by the cross-party
referendum movement headed by Mr Mario Segni, the then Christian Democrat
reformist politician who left the party in March this year.
Once in January the courts gave the go-ahead for a total of 10 referendums
to be held in April, a clock was ticking. The commission had to act either
to anticipate the referendum or to adhere to the results. One of the
referendum proposals was for introducing majority voting in the Senate for
238 of the 315 seats with the remainder retaining proportional
representation. Another proposal concerned the abolition of the existing
laws regarding the municipal and regional elections.
The commission, deeply divided on the nature of electoral reform, opted to
await the outcome of the April 19-20 referendum on reform of the senate.
But in the case of municipal election laws agreement was reached in March on
proposals similar to those contained in the referendum. The referendum was
thus unnecessary on this issue. The municipal reforms introduced majority
voting in all towns with populations over 15,000 and direct elections for
mayor, with a second round run-off between the two most voted candidates
where none obtained an absolute majority the first time. Voting was also to
be held on one day instead of the traditional leisurely two-day schedule for
local and national elections.
This system was tested on June 6, with a run-off on June 20, covering a
broad cross-section of Italian towns and cities with nearly a quarter of the
electorate involved. The reformer's two broad objectives were clearly
achieved. The first aim was to shift the voter's attention away from the
traditional blind party loyalty and instead chose a specific candidate.
The second was to provide a system that ensured stable local administrations
over a four-year period of office - during the course of the past year the
administrations in the big four cities of Milan, Naples, Rome and Turin have
collapsed because the governing coalitions have disintegrated.
To this end, the winning mayoral candidate has the right to chose 60 per
cent of the seats in the municipal council, the remainder being apportioned
on the basis of the party's share of the vote. For Italians it was a wholly
new experience to see the 145 new mayors declared winners and then promptly
have assured stability for their administrations. Normally elections have
been pursued by several months of uncertain and unseemly politicking. The
impact of the clean-cut results in the new municipal system could well
affect the course of electoral reform now being debated in parliament.
Since the reform of the senate referendum triumphed in April, parliament has
been obliged to respect the voters' sentiment by producing similar rules for
the 630-seat chamber of deputies. Agreement has been reached on a
first-past-the-post system for 75 per cent of the seats, with 25 per cent
reserved for proportional representation to guarantee minority parties.
An ample majority rejected the idea of a second round run-off in those
constituencies where there was no outright winner. They argued the second
round risked encouraging a series of local alliances which could not easily
be translated into a cohesive parliamentary alliance. The main proponent of
copying the French-style run-off was the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) which calculated it could benefit precisely from such
a system. But with all parties so manifestly weak, save the populist Lombard
League in the north, the principle of a second round could yet be adopted.
The parties will also have to make up their minds how voters are going to
approach the 25 per cent proportional element. If the electorate is
encouraged to place one vote for a candidate and a second for a party, this
could produce what one commentator called 'a vote from both the head and the
heart'.
The proposals in any event should be ready before the summer recess. The
next stage will be the preparation of new laws redefining constituencies - a
complex process that could take four months. Nevertheless it is hard to see
fresh elections taking place without changes to the constituency
legislation. Beyond this, the constitutional reform committee should, if
parliament remains in session, address such key issues as whether or not the
president, or indeed the prime minister, should be directly elected.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (4): Perilous times for big city mayors -
Municipalities have suffered from a trio of ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW JOBS are less enviable than mayor of a big Italian city. Prestige, staff
and an office in the most splendid palazzo in town are there aplenty, but
occupational hazards include high blood pressure and the risk of an early
grave.
Municipal administration has suffered from a growing trio of ills in recent
years. Coalitions have engendered problems in administration;
belt-tightening by the state has caused growing financial difficulties;
while law and order has been an increasing concern, notably in the south.
Eroding party allegiances have turned a mayor's job increasingly from chief
administrator to umpire between heterogeneous, and sometimes volcanic,
coalitions. Like the referee on Italy's fractious football fields, mayoral
authority is not always respected, and can often be questioned by all.
The need for urban coalitions stems from the traditional voting system,
based on proportional representation. That has traditionally returned a
rainbow of parties to council chambers. With one, or even a small group, of
parties seldom able to muster a majority, ill-disciplined coalitions have
become the norm.
Matters were exacerbated by an institutional system which required even
minor decisions, such as contracts to cut the grass in parks, to be approved
by the full chamber. The system left city administrations as hostages to the
whims of coalition members, who might withdraw support unless granted their
wishes on some special platform.
Matters should change following this year's introduction of new rules to
relieve the paralysis which has afflicted almost every council chamber in
Italy's big cities.
The new laws allow for the direct election of mayor, the reduction in size
of local assemblies and adoption of a guaranteed majority for the party
winning the most votes over a certain trigger level. Together, reformists
believe the changes will revolutionise urban politics by reinforcing the
mayor, who will also be able to nominate many members of the civic
administration independently of political parties.
Direct election means the mayor will be distanced from the party apparatus,
theoretically creating a more secure position, in which parties will depend
on the mayor rather than vice versa.
Stability should also be improved by making the mayoral term four years,
which can only be terminated prematurely by a vote by the entire municipal
assembly. As that will trigger automatic new elections, it may contribute to
greater restraint among trigger-happy councillors ready to bring down an
administration if their wishes are not met.
The changes will overturn the way in which big Italian cities have been
governed, says Piero Bassetti, chairman of Milan's chamber of commerce and
an unsuccessful candidate for mayor in this month's elections. 'This is
bound to foster greater stability'.
Giampiero Borghini, the former mayor and another unsuccessful contender this
month, is less sanguine. 'The impact of the new law will depend very much on
the candidates,' he says.
Mr Borghini believes a candidate backed by one powerful party, such as the
Lombard League, which has won commanding positions in many big towns in
Italy's richest region, should have the moral and institutional clout to
create strong urban administrations.
But he is less certain that will be the case in towns where the new
administration comprises broader coalitions. In such cases, the mayor could
still face the traditional problems of inching through the minefield of
coalition politics rather than reforming urban government.
If arbitrating between ill-fitting coalitions were not enough, many city
mayors also have to grapple with tragic finances. Italy's biggest cities are
deeply in debt as spending has increasingly outweighed receipts from central
government and local taxes.
The need to boost local revenues has increased as financial constraints on
the national budget have led to cuts in direct transfers from the state to
local coffers.
Milan's debts now total about L6,000bn compared with an annual income of
L3,500bn. That means about one third of council spending goes on debt
servicing. In Naples, matters grew so acute earlier this year that the city
declared itself bankrupt.
The downturn in central funding has combined with the impact of Italy's
corruption scandal to create a new emphasis on accountability and
transparency in local government.
A stream of candidates in this month's administrative elections stressed the
need for costs and benefits to be evaluated much more carefully than in the
past, when the steady flows of cash from Rome led to a much less
budget-conscious approach in local government. The emphasis now is on saving
money.
The change is accompanied by a new stress on 'de-politicising' many local
government functions following the revelations of the corruption scandal.
Investigations in Milan, Rome and Naples have already uncovered countless
cases of urban enterprises, such as the energy authority, being used as milk
sows by the governing parties.
Reforming municipal finances and cleaning up city administrations featured
prominently on the agenda of many local politicians in this month's polls.
In Milan, Marco Formentini, the candidate for the Lombard League, went so
far as to propose local bonds to finance communal services. The bonds,
issued to investors in the city, would improve transparency and indirectly
reflect the quality of the services being provided, he claimed.
The bond idea may be politically appealing but impractical. By contrast,
local politicians are now regularly emphasising privatisation as a way to
raise revenues and cut debts.
Municipally-owned companies play a remarkably big role in the economies of
many cities. Big Italian municipalities control a range of services,
including fresh milk, pharmacies, energy and transportation.
While some, such as public transport, are usually loss-makers, others are
highly profitable. So far, only a handful of big cities have sold their milk
operations.
While administration and finance are common themes across the country, law
and order tends to split Italy between north and south.
In the rich north and much of the centre, the problem is principally drug
abuse and petty crime. In the south, however, the issue of law and order
means combatting powerful and entrenched criminal organisations such as
Sicily's Cosa Nostra or the Neapolitan Camorra.
Some southern councils have been so severely infiltrated, or even taken
over, by criminal organisations that special administrators have had to be
imposed by the interior ministry. Combatting crime in the south is a complex
problem, as in some cases it requires a cultural change among inhabitants
sceptical about the state, cynical about public services and accustomed to a
code of silence.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (1): A move into the fast lane - Italy has
been undergoing profound changes which strike at the very heart of the
political and economic system. Robert Graham discusses the reforms taking
place, as the country embarks on rapid modernisation in an attempt to keep
up with its European partners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EVENTS in Italy seem to possess a never-ending capacity to surprise.
A car bomb explodes at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence; seven times premier
Giulio Andreotti is accused of consorting with the Mafia and plotting to
kill a journalist; the Ferruzzi family surrenders control of the second
biggest private industrial group amid a mountain of debt; Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy, becomes the first
non-politician this century to be prime minister.
Things are happening with such bewildering speed, there is a risk of
analytical indigestion.
Within the space of the past 12 months, Italy has had two prime ministers.
There have been no fewer than five different people holding the finance
ministry and three foreign ministers. The leaders of five parties have
stepped down, and the Socialist leadership has changed twice.
These changes are some of the many symptoms of the profound process of
political and economic transformation overtaking Italy. Amid considerable
confusion, the nation is casting off a corrupt political system and
reshaping the dominant role of the state in the economy through
liberalisation and privatisations. In a great hurry, and in forced
circumstances, Italy is attempting to modernise itself and carry out reforms
to avoid being left in the slow lane of Europe, isolated on the other side
of the Alps.
Historians will have to decide whether Italy has embarked on a revolution.
At this stage it looks more akin to a movement restoring a democracy which
was hijacked by a corrupt establishment. The present phase is clearly
transitional, leaving behind the First Republic with its constitutional laws
that encouraged a series of mutually balancing (and neutralising)
institutions, shaped by the trauma of fascism and the needs of what was
still a poor country.
In this phase anomalies are bound to exist. The composition of parliament
for instance, no longer represents the mood of the electorate. In the light
of this month's partial municipal elections the four-party coalition, which
is notionally the basis for the Ciampi government's parliamentary majority,
represents only 20 per cent of the vote.
The parties themselves are in mutation seeking new alliances, fresh
identities and credible policies. The long-ruling Christian Democrats and
Socialists are disintegrating, while the populist Lombard League of Umberto
Bossi has taken over the rich industrial north, planting its flag in the
municipality of Milan. The former communist party, Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS), retains old allegiances in the centre. The country's political
geography is being redefined with a strong pull towards less central control
and more recognition of regional initiative and identity. The spectre of a
northern secession spearheaded by the League is still a mixture of bluff and
astute tactics by a north impatient with Rome's reluctant reformism.
With so many vested interests at stake, there has been considerable
behind-the-scenes resistance - especially over lessening political control
in the state companies. Such rearguard action is one reason why the pace of
privatisation has been so disappointingly slow. A more sinister reaction has
been last month's car bombs in Rome and Florence. Although the precise
authorship of these outrages remains unclear (the authorities have blamed
the Mafia), the message is unmistakeable: there are still people willing to
create a climate of tension. But this is not the Seventies and society is in
no mood to put up with such blackmail.
External pressure for change has played, and will continue to play, an
important role. The financial markets and Italy's EC partners have obliged
the government and parliament to reduce the huge public sector deficit and
lower the mountain of debt to meet Maastricht Treaty criteria. This has
meant cutting state hand-outs, reassessing the funding of the welfare state
and ending feather-bedding in the public sector. Any lingering doubts on
this score were brought home by the September currency crisis and the lira's
enforced exit from the European Monetary System.
Internally, the magistrates and electorate (through the elections and
referendums) take near equal credit. The old guard of politicians has been
discredited and swept aside by the nationwide efforts of magistrates
investigating corruption. No modern democracy has witnessed such devastating
action by the judiciary - one in six members of the chamber of deputies is
under investigation for corruption.
Through a deliberate policy of leaking information to the press, the
magistrates have laid bare the incestuous structure of power that evolved in
the post-war years under the guise of defending Italy against communism. The
parties in government enriched themselves by demanding fat bribes from
businessmen in return for contracts and political protection; business in
most cases appeared more than happy to oblige, and certainly never
complained in public.
Some of the most important company names and their managers have been caught
and damaged by the scandals which touch every area of activity from
kick-backs on fixing pharmaceutical prices to percentages on power stations
contracts.
In this climate, the long taboo subject of political links with the Mafia is
being touched. The political protection given to organised crime is one of
the explanations why the Mafia has survived and prospered so long in the
south. Investigation of these links may help elicit the truth behind the
countless unsolved mysteries of the past which rest on the nation's
conscience - such as the kidnap and murder of former premier Aldo Moro.
The Mafia's power is beginning to crack - another important element in the
process of change. The Amato and now the Ciampi governments can claim credit
for putting in place more effective measures to fight organised crime. But
public pressure for action could scarcely be ignored in the wake of the
killings of the two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and
Paolo Borsellino.
Public pressure has also been vital in pressing electoral reform as the
prerequisite for political renewal. It is an eloquent commentary on the
outgoing political class that parliament has been obliged to accept
electoral reform rather than anticipate it. As a result of the April
referendum, majority voting is being introduced for 75 per cent of the
seats, the remainder retaining the old system of proportional
representation.
However, to be fair, the previous government of Professor Giuliano Amato
never had the parliamentary backing to press political reform. Prof Amato
made a valuable contribution to the transition, and even accelerated it by
attacking public spending, initiating reforms of the civil service and
regional administration and removing political appointees from state
companies. However, he fell in May in good measure because his four-party
coalition lacked the moral authority to impose new electoral laws.
Mr Ciampi was a choice of last resort by President Oscar Luigi Saclfaro.
No-one else could command sufficient prestige and be above the party fray;
and he stepped in out of a sense of duty even though he was ready to retire
from the Bank of Italy.
He has stated his task is twofold - oversee electoral reform and draw up
another austerity budget for 1994, with the clear aim of calling elections
as soon as possible.
Legislation for electoral reform should be in place by the summer recess;
but this will have to be complemented by new laws redrawing the
constituencies, which could take up to four months to approve. In other
words, even if a majority of parliament wishes to hold elections in the
autumn, this might be impractical.
At the moment the majority of parliament wants to see the legislature last
at least until next spring. This would give the parties time to reorganise,
and permit Mr Ciampi sufficient elbow room to get privatisation on course
and ensure the public sector deficit is being tackled in earnest. But the
Lombard League and PDS are adamant in demanding autumn elections, and Mr
Ciampi cannot easily survive for another year in the present unpredictable
circumstances.

PALLADIUM continued its recent strong performance on the London bullion
market. Dealers said that tightening Russian supplies were the cause of the
recent rally. They also noted good demand from Japan and North America. In
Chicago SOYABEANS were higher in fast early trading as a renewed round of
fund buying pushed prices to contract highs. Fundamentals were little
changed, traders said. Excessively wet weather in the western US Midwest
soyabean-
growing regions continues to plague the soyabean crop. New York raw SUGAR
was lower in all months at midsession with nearby months feeling the most
pressure on expectations for ample to abundant nearby supply. Analysts said
forecasts for tightening global supply later this year and into 1994 was
underpinning the back months. But uncertainty over how much would be
delivered against spot July, which comes off the board today, and continuing
sluggish demand in the cash market continued to undercut the front months.
London COCOA futures closed with modest losses as the market struggled to
consolidate after experiencing a downside technical correction.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia gives go-ahead for BP
consortium's oil development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE COLOMBIAN government has given the go-ahead for the development of the
Cusiana oil fields, discovered by British Petroleum and its partners Total,
Triton and Eco Petrol.
BP estimates crude reserves for the Cusiana and Cupiagua structures in the
eastern Andean foothills at 2bn barrels, though the state oil company Eco
Petrol tends to be more conservative. There are also large gas deposits.
Production will rise from 10,000 barrels a day to 150,000 b/d by the end of
1995, with the state companies sharing development costs. Investment in this
first phase is expected to reach about USDollars 1.2bn and involve the
expansion of the central pipeline, which runs from the eastern plains across
the Andes mountains. A 1,600-hectare (3,950-acre) settlement-free zone has
been established around Cusiana in an attempt to cut off guerrilla access.
A second stage of development could take output above 600,000 b/d in 1998.
That would mean investing another Dollars 5bn or more, depending on the
exact production level and which transport option was chosen.
One possibility would be the use of the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline as
output from Cano Limon declines, another would involve taking the crude
through Venezuela to the gulf of Maracaibo. Mr David Simon of BP said
earlier this month at the Latin American energy conference that improved
technology would allow very high well productivity and that the costs of
drilling the deep Cusiana wells had fallen by 50 per cent.
Colombia produces about 450,000 b/d of crude at present and exports some
180,000 b/d. The Cusiana and Cupiagua fields ensure a big increase in
foreign earnings and fiscal income from the mid-1990s - the discussion as to
how the extra income should be used is hotting up. After 1998 Cusiana
exports could be bringing in Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn a year, equivalent
to half of Colombia's current total exports. Despite the need for spending
on infrastructure and social projects, economists are worried about
inflationary pressures and exchange rates. International reserves are
already high at Dollars 8bn and exports are losing competitiveness because
of the slowdown in devaluation. Part of the Cusiana income may be frozen for
the future and some used to pre-pay foreign debt.
Although the Cusiana discovery has focused interest on Colombia -
particularly on the eastern plains - some foreign companies are discouraged
by guerilla problems and tax rates. Exploration drilling has dropped off in
the last two years and Eco Petrol is offering some of its 'reserved' areas
in an attempt to boost interest. To help fund refining and pipeline projects
the state company recently launched a Dollars 150m Eurobond issue, with
immediate success.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcoa shows the way with
aluminium cuts - An attempt to forestall EC protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL O'NEILL, the idiosyncratic chairman of the Aluminium Company of
America, believes aluminium production cuts are urgently needed to forestall
protectionist action by the European Community against the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
And who better to show the way than Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium
producer? So, with all the drama he could muster, Mr O'Neill announced late
on Monday that Alcoa was to cut its annual primary aluminium production in
the US by 268,000 tonnes or nearly 25 per cent and lay off 750 people in
five states.
This action had to be taken because of 'a lack of any mechanism to deal with
the economic consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union', he
said. Alcoa had opted to make the cuts rather than to seek protectionist
action by the US government.
Mr O'Neill believes in banging the drum hard when he has something important
to say. The production cuts are deep - the deepest taken by any group since
the aluminium market descended into turmoil in 1991 when it was engulfed by
a huge surge in imports from the CIS. But more cuts are needed and it is
clear that one reason Mr O'Neill made so much noise is that he hopes other
western producers will follow Alcoa's example.
He also hopes the European Commission will get the message - that rather
than resort to protectionism, the western aluminium industry must learn to
live with the unpredictable and uncontrolled flood of CIS exports which have
been boosting stocks and depressing world aluminium prices to their lowest
level in real terms.
Until now Alcoa has made only marginal production capacity cuts and Mr
O'Neill has argued that the western world's high-cost smelters, most of them
in Europe, should close rather than Alcoa's, which are among those with the
lowest costs.
Now he has changed his tune because the US producers face a new threat: the
European Commission, using regulations that allow it to 'safeguard' European
industry, might impose draconian quotas on aluminium imports from the CIS.
The European Aluminium Association says CIS aluminium exports to Europe, the
nearest big consuming market, rose from 123,457 tonnes in 1990 to 361,185
tonnes the following year and reached 582,000 tonnes in 1992. This has
completely destabilised a market which last year consumed 4.76m tonnes of
the metal.
The association suggests that modern EC smelters might be forced to close to
make way for metal from polluting CIS plants. It has delivered a study to
the commission which indicates the CIS aluminium industry's emission of
hazardous substances is eight to ten times higher than European regulations
permit.
'While we do not deny that the CIS has a place in our market, it is the
abnormal quantities and the effect on prices that make some action
necessary,' said Mr Dick Dermer, the EAA president, yesterday.
Mr Bernard Legrand, who heads the aluminium activities of Pechiney of
France, Europe's biggest producer, has suggested in the past that Europe has
played its part in cutting high-cost capacity. Between 1982 and the end of
1992 some 665,000 tonnes of capacity was permanently shut in the EC area. In
contrast, those North American so-called Lazarus smelters, which closed
during the last recession, have come back into production. Last year
Pechiney played its part by cutting 20 per cent from output at its smelters
in France and the Netherlands.
If the European Commission was to impose quotas, the CIS metal would simply
flow elsewhere, mainly to the US and Japan, the two other big consuming
markets. Mr O'Neill is obviously concerned that this might lead to even
lower prices in Alcoa's domestic market.
This is one of the arguments being used by the CIS aluminium industry in a
written submission to the commission this week. Its new trade organisation,
Intercomalum, also pointed out that any drop in CIS income would make it
even more difficult for the aluminium industry to carry out
environmentally-necessary work at its smelters. There would also be less
money for downstream joint ventures with western groups for such things as
aluminium can production plants, which would absorb more CIS metal
domestically.
Mr O'Neill said Alcoa will complete its production cuts at Badin, North
Carolina; Rockdale, Texas; Warrick County, Indiana; and Wentachee,
Washington in three weeks. It would make up for the shortfall in output by
buying in the market. Mr O'Neill said that if Alcoa's production cuts helped
to reduce world aluminium stocks and brought higher prices, this would more
than offset the cost of the cuts. The industry needed prices of between 80
to 85 cents a lb to cover its full costs and invest in new capacity,
compared with about 56 cents yesterday. The industry would continue to 'eat
its capital' until prices went back to these levels and an industry that did
not cover not only its operating costs but also its replacement costs was
'going out of business'.
Mr O'Neill pointed out that the aluminium industry was not alone in
suffering from a flood of CIS exports. He predicted that eventually the
problem would affect the west's high-technology sectors such as aerospace.
London Metal Exchange traders had been expecting news of substantial
aluminium production cuts for some weeks and prices have been buoyed up by
these expectations. So, after an early upward burst yesterday following the
Alcoa announcement, profit-taking sent the price for aluminium for delivery
in three months tumbling back to end the day at Dollars 1,228.25 a tonne,
down Dollars 12.50.
Analysts said more production cuts were needed, of at least the same size as
Alcoa's, if any big impact was to be made on LME stocks, now at a record of
nearly 2m tonnes. There is also a huge quantity of CIS aluminium unsuitable
for the LME also in western stockpiles.
Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium producer, would not comment
on rumours that it would follow Alcoa's lead.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, estimated that the Alcoa cuts would still leave

FT  30 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Court turns down German
challenge to banana regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday lost its battle to get the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg to suspend the controversial new EC banana regime, which comes
into force tomorrow.
The regime puts a 2m tonnes quota on European Community imports of Latin
American, or 'dollar zone' bananas, subject to 20 per cent duty, and an
Ecu850- (Pounds 650-) a tonne tariff, equivalent to 170 per cent, on imports
above that level. The measure is designed to protect higher-cost banana
producers in the EC's outlying territories and former colonies, to which it
is bound by the Lome trade and aid convention.
The new regime also distributes 30 per cent of the dollar banana quota among
traditional importers from the Lome countries, effectively allowing them to
cross-subsidise their operations.
Senior Brussels officials say the banana regulation has been the most
lobbied issue in EC history, and the community still faces action by the
Latin American producers through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Germany, backed by the Benelux countries and German banana importers, argued
that it was protected by a 'banana protocol' to the EC's Treaty of Rome,
guaranteeing it unimpeded access to the fruit. Germans ate the majority of
the 2.4m tonnes of dollar bananas the EC imported in 1991, out of total
consumption of 3.7m tonnes.
Bonn and the German importers also claimed the measure amounted to an
expropriation and redistribution of market share, which it would not be
possible to reverse once the new rules took effect. The court yesterday
ruled that the new regime did not cause 'serious and irreparable damage' to
Germany, because the regulation, passed by a majority of the 12 in February
after six years of wrangling, allowed the European Commission to rectify
'eventual difficulties'. Brussels says it will raise the quota in line with
demand.
Lawyers acting for dollar banana importers say judges were irritated by a
flood of new pleadings. Germany argued for its own exemption - impossible to
work in a border-free single market - and then for raising the quota to 2.9m
tonnes.
Brussels in the interim produced revised EC figures, showing that the
community imported only 2.2m tonnes of dollar bananas last year, and not, as
previously thought, 2.8m tonnes.

<TEXT>
PROTECTING THE forest habitat of the the spotted owl supposedly drove North
American lumber prices through the roof early this year as fears of wood
shortages were raised.
The spotted owl controversy is still rife, but lumber prices have collapsed.
The cost of 1,000 board-feet of Canadian spruce dropped from Dollars 475 in
mid-March to Dollars 235 in early June, according to Madison's Canadian
Lumber Reporter.
Traders explain that improved weather in the Pacific north-west has aided
logging, while a slower-than-expected US economic recovery has dulled demand
for houses, and hence for wood.
The US Commerce Department yesterday reported that May home sales fell 21
per cent to an annualised rate of 571,000 units, the largest decline in 12
years. Chicago lumber futures dropped on the news, with the July delivery
price down Dollars 3.80 at Dollars 234.70 per 1,000 board-feet.

HUNGARY PLANS a sweeping reorganisation of its meat industry to reduce
excess processing capacity and strengthen a sector hit hard by the collapse
of its traditional markets in eastern Europe, officials said, reports Reuter
from Budapest.
Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the agriculture ministry, said the
consolidation scheme could allow enterprises carrying heavy debt loads, but
otherwise able to compete, to refinance themselves with bonds that the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would subscribe as the sole
buyer.
He said the EBRD had reviewed the plan favourably but the Hungarian
government still needed to approve it. In any event, Hungary would be forced
to close some unprofitable plants, he added.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: US prices little changed on weak economic
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of data showing sustained weakness in the economy failed to lift
longer-dated US Treasury prices yesterday, but yields remained close to
record levels.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 105
25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.994 per cent.
The economic news was bullish for bonds. May leading indicators fell 0.3 per
cent, while new home sales were down 21 per cent, a much bigger fall than
analysts had expected.
Also, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 58.9 per
cent in June, down from 61.9 per cent - the sixth time in the seven months
since the presidential election that confidence has fallen.
The news cheered fixed-income investors but it was only at the short end
that prices responded. At the long end, where yields fell on Monday to
record levels, prices firmed in early trading but dropped back later amid
profit-taking. Dealers said demand for longer-dated securities was
temporarily exhausted after Monday's big gains.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds eased yesterday as traders prepared their books for
today's record auction of gilt-edged stock, which is expected to generate
substantial overseas interest.
The Bank of England is selling Pounds 3.25bn of 10-year bonds carrying an 8
per cent coupon, and the auction, which increases an existing issue to
around Pounds 7bn, is expected to be very tightly bid.
The auction comes at a time when the combination of low inflationary
pressures, slow recovery and a strengthening pound makes UK paper
particularly attractive to overseas investors.
Economists estimate that around 20 per cent of gilt investment is now held
overseas, with the bulk in the 10 to 15-year range, and dealers said
yesterday that there was strong interest from overseas, especially Japanese
investors who were preparing to sell dollars in order to buy gilts.
The feeling in UK trading rooms was that if the auction was covered more
than 1.5 times it would be considered a success.
Medium-dated issues slipped back as dealers ensured that they were short of
stock ahead of the issue and the key 10-year gilt that is being auctioned
today fell  5/32 to 102 7/32 . Short-dated issues were steady and
index-linked gilts, which have been left behind recently as the market
concentrated on conventional issues, bounced smartly.
THE LATE announcement of a German budget package and its possible
implications for an interest rate cut gave a brief fillip to government
bonds, which had been trading disinterestedly.
However, bund prices were unable to sustain the rally that briefly followed
the announcement of DM20bn of spending cuts.
Bund futures for September opened at 95.76 and had drifted downwards in
early trading as hopes of a rate cut at tomorrow's Bundesbank council
meeting receded.
When the news of the budget package came through, the contract sparked ahead
to 95.90 but by the close it had been taken down again to close 0.02 lower
on the day at 95.74.
Belgian bonds picked up on German rate cut hopes and at the weekly T-bill
auction the average rate on three-month T-bills fell to 6.68 per cent from
6.80 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds were easier ahead of a FFr17bn to FFr19bn OATs
auction tomorrow and the yield spread between French and German 10-year
issues widened slightly.
On the Matif, the September futures contract had been strongly through 120
in overnight trading but it was unable to hold that level and came back
during official trading hours to close 0.10 lower at 119.82.
IN THE high-yielding government bond markets, Italy bounced 0.40 to 102.63
in the September futures contract while Spain traded sideways ahead of an
auction today of one-year paper and an auction tomorrow of three-year,
five-year and 10-year Bonos.
THE JAPANESE bond market focused on the prospect of heavy supply, due to the
announcement of a seven-year Y225bn global bond issue from the World Bank,
with the benchmark No 145 easing 10 basis points to 106.96.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Bonds: World Bank Y225bn global issue offers
broad appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK turned heads with the launch of its giant Y225bn global bond
deal yesterday. The seven-year bond issue has been much talked about in the
market and is expected to appeal to a broad range of international investors
 -who want to enjoy the benefit of further currency appreciation - as well
as Japanese investors hoping that a further interest rate cut will trigger a
rally in Japanese government bonds and other yen-denominated issues.
Daiwa Europe, Goldman Sachs, and IBJ International, the three joint
lead-managers, yesterday boasted that their 60 per cent allocation of the
deal was already 'placed and substantially oversold'. Other houses generally
praised the indicated pricing for the deal but said that, given the sheer
size, it might take a while to place all of the paper.
Yesterday's offering is the World Bank's fourth global yen deal. It already
has a five-year issue and two 10-year deals behind it but was keen to tap
the seven-year area given the shortage of paper in this maturity. Dealers
predict the issue will become an important seven-year benchmark.
The yen has been appreciating steadily against the US dollar in recent
months, moving from Y126 to the dollar at the beginning of the year to
Y105.32 on June 14. Since then, it has moved back to around Y111 - Y112 on
political jitters, but subsequently strengthened again to reach Y107 to the
dollar yesterday.
Several houses predict that the yen has further to appreciate, and some are
pointing to a trading range of Y90 to Y110. 'There is a belief that the yen
could go to 100 to the dollar, so international investors are looking for
currency appreciation,' said Mr Denis Kelleher of Daiwa Europe.
Meanwhile, Japanese investors are expected to be drawn by the prospect of a
cut in the official discount rate, possibly after the election if the
economy shows no sign of picking up, dealers said.
'There are some very large tickets in Tokyo: they are looking for a
reasonably liquid asset, which is tradeable around-the-clock, with some
pick-up over the JGB,' said one dealer.
The bonds will be priced today with an indicated yield spread of 11 - 13
basis points over the JGB No 129. In the secondary market, the World Bank's
five-year bond deal is trading at a yield spread of around 26 basis points
over the JGB No 105 while the 10-year issue is about 18 basis points over
the JGB No 145.
Aside from the World Bank's deal, the international bond market saw a couple
of smallish Euroyen deals - from Osaka Gas and Korea Development Bank - and
a handful of Eurodollar issues, including a Dollars 350m, five-year deal
from Tokyo Gas Co.
Japanese utilities have been flocking to the market, lured by the relatively
attractive pricing and the longer maturities available.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB introduces further cuts
in transaction fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German screen-based futures and options
market, will tomorrow introduce a further round of cuts in transaction fees.
Following on from a round of fee cuts last year, fees on stock and index
instruments for investors and market-makers will be cut by an average of 23
per cent, Mr Jorg Franke, one of the exchange's two chief executives, said
yesterday.
Mr Franke said the fee reductions did not extend to products based on debt
instruments. The move is aimed especially at private investors, who are
mainly drawn to stock and index-linked products, he said. The cuts are also
a way of sharing the profitability of the exchange with investors, he said.
Pre-tax profits at the DTB nearly trebled to DM42.2m (Dollars 25.4m) last
year, reflecting a reduction in costs as well as higher income due to
heavily increased trading volume.
Mr Franke reported that the number of contracts handled by the DTB had risen
by 50 per cent to 21.11m in the period to June 25 this year.
DTB's strategy for 1993 is based to a large extent on further expansion
abroad: in May this year, trading screens went on-line in Amsterdam and,
according to Mr Franke, demand from institutions in other financial centres
is high. But as Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, DTB chairman, has recently stressed,
the lack of a central regulatory body for the German securities industry
hampers the exchange's plans to expand abroad.
The DTB said that plans to link with Matif, the French futures and options
exchange, were moving ahead on schedule. The aim is to finalise the
co-operation agreement for consideration by the two exchanges by the end of
the summer.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea will substantially ease foreign exchange controls and open the
bond market to foreign investors by 1997, the ministry of finance said
yesterday.
The country will also allow foreign institutions to become shareholders in
domestic banks during the next three or four years.
The majority of the changes, however, will not occur until 1996 or 1997 and
the programme does not promise full abolition of foreign exchange controls
nor unlimited foreign access to the bond market.
Although it will lift restrictions on speculative trading in foreign
exchange markets, for example, the government warned that it will not
tolerate 'excessive currency speculation'.
Documentation proving actual demand for routine foreign exchange
transactions will be phased out, although 'the principle of real demand will
be maintained.'
The government also promised to 'pursue' a free-floating exchange rate
system' during 1996 and 1997.
From next year, foreigners will be allowed to underwrite state and public
bonds, including housing bonds, with interest rates 'comparable' with
international rates.
International organisations, such as the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank will be allowed to float won-denominated bonds on the
domestic market in 1995, and foreigners will then be able to buy bond-type
beneficiary certificates in an indirect opening of the bond market.
By 1997, foreigners will be allowed to acquire long-term and non-guaranteed
bonds issued by small and medium businesses.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Northern suffers from purchasing
switch / A look at problems facing the Canadian telecoms group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom has a history of skidding on an oily patch every few years.
The Canadian telephone equipment maker has been fortunate, however, to find
a new driver each time with the skill to straighten the wheel and put down
the pedal for another burst of speed.
Northern is now in just such a skid. Following a 27 per cent drop in
first-quarter earnings, it announced last week it expected a loss in the
second quarter and 'significantly' lower earnings for the year as a whole.
Its share price has tumbled 28 per cent in the past two days to CDollars 34.
True to form, a new driver - in this case, two new drivers - have taken the
wheel. The appointments of Mr Jean Monty, who took over as chief executive
from Dr Paul Stern last March, and Mr Bradford Butler, named to replace Dr
Stern as chairman last week, give a clue to how Northern plans to deal with
its latest problems.
Mr Monty, an astute and personable Quebecer, was previously head of
Northern's sister company, Bell Canada, the country's biggest telephone
utility. Bell is not only a big Northern customer, but is about the same
size as each of the US regional operating companies on which Northern
depends for sales of its computerised telephone switches.
Mr Butler is a former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer
goods group. He is described by a fellow-director at Northern as 'a great
people guy' with excellent contacts in the US.
Dr Stern's legacy was to broaden Northern's international base. He led
Northern into the acquisition of STC, the UK telecommunications group, and
forged a valuable joint venture with Matra of France.
But his abrasive style and emphasis on international growth have hit
Northern's core business in North America. Mr Michael Arellano, analyst at
Northern Business Information in New York, says the company 'might not have
had these problems if customer service and software quality had been given
more attention over the past four years.'
Northern ascribes its difficulties to lower-than-expected sales of switching
equipment. But this sits awkwardly alongside indications from US local
telephone companies that they are pushing ahead with substantial capital
investment programs which are little changed from previous years, or in some
cases larger.
BellSouth, the 'Baby Bell' serving the south-eastern US, says it plans to
spend Dollars 3bn a year over the next three years on capital equipment -
roughly the same as last year. Nynex, which serves the north-eastern US,
says it expects capital spending to be at around Dollars 2bn a year for some
time.
Pacific Bell, which serves California, is spending Dollars 1bn over the next
five years to replace analogue switches - the computers which route calls -
with digital equipment, a Northern speciality. That is some Dollars 330m
more than it would normally spend on switching equipment in a five-year
period.
At the same time, increasing competition in the US local telephone market
should provide more customers for switching equipment.
Northern has been slow to latch on to some of the fastest-growing areas of
telecommunications, notably transmission, cellular and wireless. It is
between 12 and 15 months behind its rivals in bringing key fibre-optic
transmission products to market. Northern predicts that transmission
products will eventually contribute as much as switching equipment to its
business, but they made up only 11 per cent of revenues last year, compared
with 50 per cent from switches.
Another challenge is the trend among US local telephone companies to place
equipment contracts with fewer vendors. Nynex is expected shortly to
announce which of four equipment suppliers - Northern Telecom, LM Ericsson,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and Siemens - has won a bid to supply 3.5m
lines of digital switching.
Mr Romy Tomlinson, managing director of technology selection at Nynex, says
the company is trying to minimise the number of vendors in order to lower
operating costs. Fewer vendors means less money spent on training people to
use the equipment, fewer problems of matching different suppliers'
equipment, and less inventory.
The move to fewer suppliers has contributed to fierce pricing pressure in
the North American market. Equipment vendors seem willing to cut prices to
ensure they are on a telecommunications company's buyer list, because if
they miss out they will have a hard time getting back on the list and may
then have to offer either extremely keen prices or next-generation
equipment.
The arrivals of Mr Monty and Mr Butler signal that Northern's priority will
be to snuggle up again to the US telephone companies. 'Northern is going to
attack the world a little differently under Monty than it did under Stern or
(previous chief) Fitzgerald,' predicts one of the company's directors.
Mr Monty's plan of action is likely to become clearer between now and July
27, when Northern publishes second-quarter earnings. At least one, and
possibly more, significant announcements are expected. One move may be to
shift resources to faster-growing products, with a consequent reduction in
switching capacity. Part of the second-quarter loss will probably comprise a
hefty write-down to reflect this adjustment.
Some recent initiatives have yet to achieve top speed. The Matra alliance,
for instance, links Northern with a leading supplier of radio systems. A
cellular venture with Motorola in North America is still getting off the
ground. But provided Mr Monty and Mr Butler are as deft as their
predecessors, it could be just be a matter of time before Northern pulls out
of its latest skid.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Steel blames loss on
Armco shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAWASAKI STEEL, the Japanese steelmaker, yesterday blamed a group loss of
Y30bn (Dollars 283m) on the restructuring of Armco Steel of the US, in which
it holds a 50 per cent stake, and on loan losses at a Japanese financial
subsidiary.
Kawasaki is still attempting to squeeze profits from Armco, in which it
acquired a stake in late 1988.
The acquisition was one of a series by Japanese steel-makers seeking to
enhance their US presence without increasing exports from Japan, which are
still a sensitive trade issue.
Group sales at Kawasaki slipped 5 per cent to Y1,310bn, while pre-tax profit
fell 69.7 per cent to Y16.1bn.
However, net profits were eroded by the company's half-share of a Dollars
460m loss at Armco, arising from the dismantling of old facilities and the
introduction of continuous casting equipment.
Another leading Japanese maker, Kobe Steel, reported a group loss of
Y14.3bn, which it said arose from weak domestic demand for steel and
machinery, and from about Y10bn in investment losses incurred by a leasing
subsidiary, Shinko Lease.
For the year ending in March, Kobe had reported a parent net profit of
Y11.76bn compared with a group net profit of Y27.25bn in the previous year.
Sales were down 8.3 per cent to Y1,334bn.
Japanese steel companies are attempting to clear the debris from the late
1980s, when some financial subsidiaries became active players on the stock
market, while others were part of the rush to lend to property developers.
Kobe Steel forecast a net profit of Y5bn for the current year, although the
continued weakening of the domestic economy could force a revision later in
the year.
The company is hoping for sales of between Y1,310bn and Y1,320bn, down
slightly on last year, but assisted by strong demand from China.
NKK, another Japanese steelmaker, reported a group net loss of Y4.45bn,
compared to a net profit of Y8bn in the previous period, and also said
profits were hurt by a Dollars 48m loss at its US steel acquisition,
National Steel.
Group sales were down 3.8 per cent to Y1,858.6bn.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Saffa plans new legal action
against KIO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAFFA, the Italian packaging and boxboard group which is locked in
litigation with the Kuwait Investment Office over alleged irregularities in
Spain, is poised to open a second front with a new legal action in London.
Mr Carlo Bonomi, Saffa's controlling shareholder, said that it planned to
claim in the UK courts that the KIO had supplied 'misleading' information
about the condition of some of its Spanish activities in which Saffa had
invested.
Earlier this year, Saffa persuaded courts in Geneva and Zurich to freeze
more than L500bn (Dollars 323m) of KIO assets in Switzerland pending the
resolution of a separate, but linked, claim.
The two actions stem from the L420bn deal in 1991 between Saffa and the KIO.
Saffa sold part of its Spanish Sarrio subsidiary to the Kuwaitis in return
for cash, stakes in Prima Immobiliaria and Ebro, two KIO-controlled
companies, and some industrial activities.
Since then, the crisis in the KIO's Spanish operations has resulted in the
deal turning sour.
Saffa has received about L120bn in cash and shares worth L200bn, but claims
that it is still owed about L110bn in cash - the reason for its Swiss court
action.
The new legal initiative is over a separate claim that the KIO misled Saffa
about the financial position of Prinma Immobiliaria, the Spanish property
group in which Saffa has a 6 per cent stake.
Prima shares have fallen steeply as a result of difficulties within the
KIO's Spanish operations and the downturn in the local property market.
Saffa claims that the price at which the shares were bought did not reflect
the true value of Prima's property holdings.
Although the sale contract was signed in Spain, Mr Bonomi claims that UK law
allows the case to be brought in London, as the information provided by the
KIO was conveyed verbally there.
Problems in Spain accounted for a significant portion of Saffa's 1992 group
losses of L34.6bn.
The company set aside L59.1bn in write-downs on its investments.

DAEWOO Heavy Industries plans to build helicopters using Russian technology,
starting next year.
The Korean company has so far been mainly a producer of aircraft fuselages
and wings and helicopter components, with aerospace sales of USDollars 56m
last year.
Daewoo will co-operate with the Mil Design Bureau to develop transport and
multipurpose helicopters for both domestic and foreign markets.
It will import helicopter production technology from the Kazan Helicopter
Production Association and engines from the Klimov Design Bureau.
The project is the latest example of Korean companies turning to Russia for
the supply of technology in areas ranging from electronics to aerospace.
Russian technology is less expensive than that from the US, and European and
Russian companies have shown greater willingness to transfer technology to
South Korea.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: American Express names new
president
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US travel and financial services group, reshuffled its
senior management yesterday, appointing Mr Jeffrey Stiefler president of the
company.
Mr Stiefler, who was chief executive of American Express's financial
services subsidiary IDS, takes over as president from chief executive Mr
Harvey Golub, who assumes the title of chairman from Mr Richard Furlaud.
American Express said Mr Furlaud, an outside director of the company since
1972, has been elected chairman of the executive committee of the board of
directors.
The changes represent a consolidation of the management installed in
February following the departure of Mr James Robinson, who had run American
Express for 15 years. After a protracted battle, Mr Robinson was forced out
because of the poor performance of the company's various divisions, and of
its share price.
The appointment of a new president, and the move of Mr Furlaud to chairman
of the executive committee, are designed to spread some of the management
load. Previously, American Express was being run solely by Mr Golub, with Mr
Furlaud's support.
Mr Stiefler's promotion is seen as a reward for his work at IDS, which
during the group's recent troubles with its loss-making securities brokerage
operations and struggling credit card business, remained a reliable source
of profits. In 1992, IDS contributed Dollars 243m to the group's overall
earnings of Dollars 436m.
This is the second time in a few years that IDS has proved a stepping stone
for management within American Express. In 1991, Mr Golub, then head of IDS,
was promoted to president of the parent group.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: YPF receives enthusiastic
trading launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in YPF, Argentina's newly-privatised oil company, got off to a
roaring start yesterday in New York and Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires,
traders pushed its share price up by 14 per cent to Dollars 21.75, having
earlier touched Dollars 23 amid scenes of frantic activity.
On Monday, the government announced it would sell 45 per cent of YPF at a
price of Dollars 19 per share, raising Dollars 3.04bn in cash in Argentina's
largest privatisation. The issue was oversubscribed by about five times, and
yesterday's trading reflected unsatisfied demand in the wholesale segment.
Mr Win Smith, chairman of Merrill Lynch International, said 'we saw broader
interest in the deal than for any transaction we have ever done,' with the
issue several times over-subscribed in the US, Argentina, and the rest of
the world.
The local and international markets' positive reception for YPF came as a
huge relief for the government. One of its objectives was to use the YPF
privatisation to reactivate Argentina's sickly equity market and open the
door for international share issues by other Argentine companies.
Heavy demand enabled the Argentine government to increase the stock
available to 140m shares from 125m, with an option on another 20m open to
underwriters.
With the market price above the Dollars 19 opening, the option is almost
certain to be taken up. The offering will be divided between 65m shares for
the US, 35m for Argentina and 40m for international mar-kets.
The government has told the worldwide sales team assembled by global
co-ordinators CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch to favour investors planning
to hold YPF for the long term over suspected short-term, speculative
players.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Falling yields trigger
record-breaking run - The unexpected revival in the US bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX weeks is a long time in the US Treasury markets. A month-and-a-half ago,
investors in US government securities were fretting that the Federal Reserve
would tighten monetary policy to curb rising inflation.
Their concerns were depressing bond prices, and had sent the yield on the
long bond up to 7.05 per cent. The bond market rally, which for two years
had pushed stock prices to record levels and fuelled an unprecedented boom
in corporate bond issuance, looked over.
Today, investors' inflation fears have abated, Fed policy appears to be back
on hold, and bond yields are heading down again. Yesterday, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond fell to under 6.6 per cent, the lowest it
has been since 1977, when the treasury began selling the 30-year issue on a
regular basis. Yields on shorter-dated securities also fell to record or
near-record levels.
Several factors have driven the impressive recovery in bond prices. First,
the inflation outlook has turned positive. In the opening months of 1993,
consumer and producer prices surged, threatening to take the annual
inflation rate above 4 per cent and beyond. Recent figures, however, showed
price rises have slowed once more. Analysts now predict annual inflation
this year will stay in the 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent range.
Second, the economy remains weak by normal post-recession standards. Since
economic growth put on a spurt in the final quarter of 1992, output growth
has slowed. Gross domestic product expanded by only 0.7 per cent in the
first quarter of this year, and is expected to remain relatively anaemic for
at least another two quarters.
Economists place much of the blame for the poor growth on President Bill
Clinton's planned tax increases, which are discouraging consumers from
spending and companies from hiring or investing in new capital, and on poor
demand from depressed overseas economies.
Third, the likelihood that the president's deficit-reduction package will be
passed by Congress this summer has cheered bond investors, who see it as the
first meaningful attempt by the administration to tackle the huge federal
budget deficit.
Finally, several technical factors are temporarily boosting bond prices.
They include the absence of immediate supply pressures (the treasury is not
due to sell new government securities until late July, which means there is
currently a shortage of notes and bonds in the market), and heavy buying of
bonds by municipal authorities eager to finance their higher-interest
bearing debt.
The impact of the bond market's unexpected revival, meanwhile, is being felt
throughout the economy.
The equity markets, which might otherwise be in serious trouble because of
the depressed economy, and the recent warnings from big companies about
earnings prospects, continue to be propped up by low interest rates. When
the 30-year yield hit a record low on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average jumped 40 points, to within less than 1 per cent of its all-time
high.
The market for new corporate debt is also benefiting greatly from low bond
yields. The interest rates on bonds issued by US companies are pegged to
treasury yields, and for the past two years corporations have been rushing
to take advantage of cheap debt by issuing bonds in record amounts.
Last year, companies issued a record Dollars 274bn in investment-grade debt,
well ahead of the previous record of Dollars 190bn set in 1991. This year,
the volume of new issues has been even greater.
According to preliminary figures just released by Securities Data in New
York, debt issuance is running at a record rate this year - up to June 29,
Dollars 208bn in investment-grade bonds had been sold in the US markets.
In May, when bond yields were rising, analysts feared it was inevitable the
boom in corporate bond issuance would slow. Now yields have dropped sharply
again they see the boom in new issues lasting at least another six months.
Mr James Quigley, head of US debt syndication at Wall Street securities
house Merrill Lynch, says: 'This year we felt that (attaining the levels of
1992) would be difficult - yet yesterday we surpassed Dollars 200bn. That
puts us on a pace for Dollars 400bn for the year. Although I think that's
unlikely, we should end the year at around Dollars 350bn.'
The vast sums of money being raised on the debt markets continues to be used
primarily to refinance older, more expensive debt. Refinancing has been a
profoundly important feature of the financial markets for the past two
years, helping to knock the balance sheet of Corporate America back into
shape after the indulgences of the highly-leveraged 1980s.
Moreover, there is little sign companies have exhausted their need for
refinancing. Mr Quigley says: 'If the long bond yield falls to 6.5 per cent,
we will see companies continuing to use debt to refinance in the third
quarter.'
Yet the Merrill banker says refinancing is not the only reason companies are
issuing debt. 'There will also be more of what I call 'opportunistic'
financing - where companies issue debt purely to take advantage of the low
rates, even if they don't need the money today.'
As for whether companies are issuing new debt to finance spending on new
capital and labour, Mr Quigley believes that will be determined primarily by
the health of the economy - 'financing for expansion is not yet pronounced'
in the market, he says.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Corning growth slows to 6% in
second period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
CORNING Inc, the US high-technology group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
increase in second-quarter earnings per share, excluding special charges,
and blamed the slow growth mainly on poor retail conditions and economic
deterioration in Europe.
The company announced net income of Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 67.2m, or 35 cents, in the same period of last year.
However, the 1992 figures were held back by a one-time reduction in equity
earnings of Dollars 16.3m, or 9 cents a share. Net sales rose from Dollars
871.5m to Dollars 906.8m.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said the company expected a continued
improvement in earnings in the second half.
However, the second-quarter results were below the company's expectations,
and the trend was similar to that in the first quarter - 'a good start in
the first eight weeks and a disappointing slow-down in the last four weeks'.
He said the US optical fibre and cable businesses were strong and the
laboratory testing business had a good quarter.
Weakness was concentrated in consumer products, which were hurt by poor
retail environments, and all of the European businesses.
Damon Corporation, a medical testing laboratory group which which was the
subject of a Dollars 370m unsolicited bid from Corning on Monday, said
yesterday its board had directed management to hold negotiations with
Corning.
Corning's move followed a Dollars 258m agreed bid for Damon last week from
National Health Laboratories.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sumitomo investment in LTV to go

<TEXT>
THE emergence of LTV, the US steel group, from Chapter 11 bankruptcy this
week has triggered a Dollars 200m investment in the group by Sumitomo Metal
Industries of Japan.
The investment, announced when LTV filed its financial reorganisation plan
early last year, involved Dollars 100m in convertible voting preferred stock
and Dollars 100m in senior secured convertible notes, about a 10 per cent
stake in the third largest US steel manufacturer.
SMI's investment comes regardless of the burdens on other Japanese
steelmakers which took equity stakes in US companies. Kawasaki Steel
announced a group loss of Y30bn (Dollars 282m), mostly due to restructuring
costs at Armco Steel of the US, in which it has a 50 per cent stake.
The investment follows ventures which began in 1984 and was decided partly
in response to the friction created by Japanese steel exports to the US,
which have been hit by anti-dumping duties.
Sumitomo has about 10 factories in the US, but said demand from Japanese
carmakers and electronics companies had increased the need for high-quality
steel, which the closer relationship with LTV was intended to provide.

IBM yesterday demonstrated advances in its speech recognition technology
that will lead to the availability within the next 12 months of
high-performance speech-to-text translation on low-cost personal computers.
The demonstrations included a dictation version of WordPerfect, one of the
most popular PC word processing programs. IBM's technology provides a
vocabulary of up to 32,000 words and can take dictation at a rate of about
70 words a minute.
Users train the system to recognise their own voice.
Promising applications of the speech recognition technology include its use
by doctors, police, social services personnel and lawyers, Mr Sherwin
predicts.
IBM also demonstrated the use of 'continuous speech' recognition to create
and manipulate data using Lotus 1-2-3, the leading PC spreadsheet program.
Atari, the video-game manufacturer, said IBM is to manufacture a new TV game
system, the Atari Jaguar. It will be made at an IBM plant in North Carolina.
Atari valued the agreement at Dollars 500m.

GENERAL Mills, the US food manufacturer and restaurant operator, yesterday
reported a fall in fourth-quarter after-tax profits in the three months to
May 30 to Dollars 67.5m from Dollars 93.1m, on unchanged sales of Dollars
2bn. Net income for the year was Dollars 506.1m, against Dollars 495.6m in
the previous 12 months.
The figures were struck after a Dollars 57.3m restructuring charge which
General Mills says should generate about Dollars 15m of annual after-tax
savings in 1994.
The company calculates that, excluding this item, earnings per share in the
12-month period would have risen about 13 per cent to Dollars 3.45.
Both the main divisions, consumer foods and restaurants, posted operating
gains of around 11 per cent during the year.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fl 150m loss forecast by Fokker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker in which Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of
Germany recently acquired a majority stake, expects to report a loss this
year of Fl 150m (Dollars 79m), compared with net profit of Fl 20m in 1992.
The company, which blamed the downturn on the malaise in the world aviation
market, said it expected an improvement in 1994 and future years, helped by
Dasa's involvement and by restructuring measures already being taken.
The predicted loss is due partly to the non-recurring cost of laying off
staff, as well as to higher interest charges caused by the burden of unsold
aircraft.
Fokker is lowering output and restructuring production of its Fokker 100
model so that final assembly takes place only when a delivery is about to be
made.
The warning of losses came after the close of trading in Amsterdam, where a
minority of Fokker's shares are still listed.
Fokker said debt levels would fall in the course of 1993. It added that its
financial position would be bolstered by the recapitalisation associated
with the sale of government-owned shares to Dasa, as well as the recent
issue of new shares to the German company, which is part of the Daimler-Benz
group.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette studies Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA-HACHETTE, the French defence electronics and media group, is keen to
participate in the French privatisation programme by taking stakes in the
Renault motor group and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, Matra-Hachette chairman, said the group was actively
considering investment in Renault, with which it already has a joint venture
to produce the Espace luxury van.
'It's clear that the government sees us as an interesting investor,' said Mr
Lagardere at the shareholders' meeting of Lagardere Group, through which his
family controls Matra-Hachette. 'If Renault's management is favourable we
would be interested in participating in its privatisation.'
Matra-Hachette's interest comes at a time of intense speculation about a
merger between Renault and Volvo of Sweden. The French government is thought
to be trying to assemble a group of noyaux durs, or long-term strategic
investors, in Renault as a precursor to privatisation and to the merger.
The government has called on companies to act as noyaux durs for all the
privatisation candidates, as it did in the mid-1980s state share sales.
Societe Generale, the bank, and Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics group, have
already indicated their interest.
IFIL, the Italian holding company linked to the Agnelli family, yesterday
also expressed its interest.
Mr Lagardere said Matra-Hachette might also invest in Aerospatiale, although
he saw its flotation as a longer-term prospect. Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French premier, has said that Aerospatiale was unlikely to be sold until
after 1995.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: State covers default at Swedbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government was forced yesterday to lay out SKr400m (Dollars
51.8m) to cover an interest payment missed by the owners of Swedbank, the
largest bank in the Nordic region by asset volume.
The move takes the state a step closer to becoming a principal shareholder
in another of Sweden's ailing bank groups.
The state Bank Support Authority stepped in to make the first interest
payment due on a SKr3.5bn commercial loan raised by Swedbank's main
shareholders as part of a government-backed package to ensure the capital
adequacy of the loss-hit bank.
The government guaranteed the commercial loan and provided a further state
loan of SKr3.8bn to the 11 savings bank foundations, whose institutions were
merged late last year to form Swedbank. In return, the foundations, which
own 55 per cent of the voting capital in Swedbank, pledged 70 per cent of
their shareholding as collateral.
However, a lack of dividend flow from Swedbank meant the foundations were
unable to pay the first interest tranche on the commercial loan, forcing the
government to redeem its guarantee and call in the equity collateral.
The Bank Support Authority was yesterday at pains to stress this did not
mean the state had, in effect, become a 40 per cent shareholder in Swedbank.
It is clearly a possibility, however, if the foundations go into deeper
default.
The state has already completely taken over two Swedish banks - Gotabanken
and Nordbanken - and pledged SKr74bn in aid for the banking sector, stricken
last year by a spate of loan losses. It is still negotiating on a further
package of aid for Swedbank.

FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ferfin share price suffers
renewed battering
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the debt-laden Italian group, and its
Montedison industrial subsidiary suffered a renewed battering on the Milan
stock market yesterday as trading resumed after Monday's one-day suspension.
Ferfin ordinary shares dipped 8.6 per cent to L498.5, while Montedison stock
slipped 8.62 per cent to L789 as speculation mounted about the causes of the
huge write-off announced by Montedison on Monday.
Ordinary shares in Ferfin have now plunged by more than 53 per cent since
the end of last month, when the group unveiled surprisingly large losses for
1992. Stock in Montedison has fallen slightly less sharply, with a drop of
30.2 per cent.
Further information about the write-off, which meant a revision of
Montedison's 1992 group losses to L1,679bn (Dollars 1.09bn) from L1,244bn,
may come at today's shareholders' meeting of Ferfin in Ravenna.
Official information about the increased loss has so far been limited to
terse comments by Mr Enrico Pizzi, a veteran board member. He said the loss
had stemmed from a 'credit, which has been revealed to be irrecoverable',
made by Financing and Investments NV.
The little-known company, based in Curacao and not listed in Montedison's
annual report, is a subsidiary of Montedison International Holding.
The scarcity of details has triggered speculation that the write-off could
be linked to illicit payments in the political corruption scandal.
Two members of the board of Montedison International Holding are involved in
financial operations linked to subsidiaries of Fiat and the big Eni state
energy and chemicals concern, both of which have been involved in kickbacks
to politicians.
Eni has admitted to using foreign subsidiaries for making illicit payments
to Italian politicians.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's key holding company, is cutting debts by
nearly SKr3bn (Dollars 385m) through the sale of its entire shareholding in
Asea, the joint owner of the Asea Brown Boveri engineering combine.
A total of 6.96m shares, equal to 7.4 per cent of Asea's capital, have been
placed with around 130 international and domestic institutions at SKr422 per
share. The move raises SKr2.94bn for Investor and produces a SKr950m capital
gain.
The deal does not significantly weaken Investor's influence over Asea,
thanks to a related agreement involving Investor associate Incentive.
This involves reclassifying 6.1m of Incentive's Asea B shares which carry
one-tenth of a vote, to one-vote A shares, while a similar number of the
shares Investor is selling will switch from A to B status.
This will increase Incentive's voting stake in Asea to 32.9 per cent from 25
per cent, while only cutting Investor's overall voting influence from 35 per
cent to 32.9 per cent. Investor holds 25.9 per cent of the capital and 34.1
per cent of the votes in Incentive.
Investor said the sale was in line with its stated strategy of cutting net
debt, which at March 31 stood at SKr9.86bn.
The investment group has stakes in many of Sweden's blue-chip companies,
including Astra, the pharmaceuticals group; Stora, the forestry concern;
SKF, the roller bearing manufacturer; and Ericsson, the telecommunications
group. Although it also holds a 1.4 per cent stake in Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, the troubled Swedish bank, it said its decision to sell was not
directly linked to SE Banken's forthcoming share issue.
The placing was arranged by Morgan Stanley International and Enskilda
Corporate. The placing price was SKr30, or 6 per cent, below the SKr452
level at which Asea's shares closed on Monday, contributing to a SKr22 fall
in Asea's share price yesterday.

HUHTAMAKI, the Finnish consumer products group, is buying the European
confectionery operations of Sweden's Procordia for SKr900m (Dollars 115.4m)
as part of a broad collaboration between the two companies.
The deal will be funded by an issue of 3m new shares to Procordia, making it
the third-largest shareholder in the Finnish company with a 10.9 per cent
stake.
The groups will also set up a joint venture pharmaceuticals operation to
boost European sales of two gynaecological products outside Scandinavia.
Buying Procordia's European confectionery businesses, which had 1992 sales
of SKr1.05bn, will add 60 per cent to the European sales of Huhtamaki's Leaf
group, already the world's 10th-largest confectionery company. Until now,
two-thirds of Leaf's sales have been generated in North America. Its 1992
European sales were FM1.32bn (Dollars 230.4m).
Huhtamaki gains a presence in several new European markets - including
Norway, Denmark and Spain - it gets access to important brands, including
Lakerol throat pastilles and SorBits sugarless chewing gum. The deal gives
Huhtamaki manufacturing units in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Spain, and
sales organisations in nine European countries.
Huhtamaki's chief executive, Mr Timo Peltola, noted that the acquired
businesses made a SKr40m loss last year, and said their prospects 'will
remain depressed for a while'. He promised further rationalisation to
increase profitability.
The co-operation within pharmaceuticals centres on Procordia's Kabi
Pharmacia unit and Huhtamaki's Leiras division, and involves joint marketing
of Kabi's Estring vaginal ring for hormonal replacement therapy and Leiras'
Levonova hormone-releasing contraceptive intra-uterine device.
Both groups are to explore further areas for co-operation, although
Procordia will be restricted to a maximum 21 per cent stake in Huhtamaki.
The transaction will not be affected by last month's accord between the
Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck group, which will split
Procordia into separate pharmaceutical and food/consumer products units this
autumn.

COMMERZBANK, Germany's third-largest private sector commercial bank, is
diversifying into the French asset management market with the acquisition of
Caisse Centrale de Reescompte, a bank owned by Groupe Paribas.
Commerzbank did not disclose the purchase price but is believed to have paid
more than DM100m (Dollars 60.2m) for CCR, one of France's leading
independent fund managers, with FFr16bn under management, 21 funds and
almost 400 institutional clients.
CCR has a full banking licence and is involved in money market and foreign
exchange activities for financial institutions.
At the end of last year CCR's balance sheet total was FFr17.8bn.
Commerzbank said the purchase would complement the activities of its
existing Paris branch (opened in 1976) as well as Commerz International
Capital Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary which specialises in fund
management for non-German clients.
The cross-border deals extend to the insurance sector as well: on Monday,
Assurances Generales de France, the large French insurer, disclosed that it
had taken its stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs from 25 to around
33.5 per cent, strengthening its ties with Germany's second biggest
insurance group.

MR UMBERTO Agnelli, chairman of Italy's Ifil diversified holding company,
yesterday raised the possibility of a bid battle for Eridania Beghin-Say,
the Paris-based sugar and foods group controlled by the troubled Ferruzzi
Finanziaria concern.
Mr Agnelli said Saint Louis, the diversified holding company in which Ifil
is a leading shareholder, could be interested in participating in a takeover
of EBS. 'If the restructuring of the Ferruzzi group leads to some sort of
operation at Eridania Beghin-Say, it's possible Saint Louis could take
part,' he said.
By contrast, Mr Agnelli ruled out a bid by BSN, the big French foods group
in which Ifil has a minority stake.
Ifil now has 15.6 per cent of Saint Louis. However, it has an agreement with
Worms - the biggest shareholder with 31.9 per cent - to raise its holding to
a similar level. Ifil also owns 7.1 per cent of the holding company
controlling Worms.
Mr Agnelli's statement comes just days after Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, the former
chairman of EBS, suggested he might be interested in bidding for the group,
possibly with Mr Raul Gardini, the previous guiding light at Ferruzzi.
Saint-Louis made no comment on Mr Agnelli's remarks. However it referred to
a statement by Mr Bernard Dumon, its chairman, saying his group was always
interested in any potential investments in the European sugar industry.
The French company has already collaborated in a number of Ifil ventures,
notably in last year's bid battle for control of the Perrier mineral water
company.
Saint-Louis eventually sold its Perrier stake for a profit to the ultimate
victor, Nestle.
Saint-Louis is the third-largest player in European sugar with interests in
other areas of food and in the paper industry. It recently announced a
modest increase in net profits, from FFr765m in 1991 to FFr774m (Dollars
138.95m) in 1992.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, dipped 3 1/2 p to 222 1/2
p yesterday after a representative of the United Mine Workers of America
told analysts the union planned to escalate strike action against Peabody,
Hanson's coal mining subsidiary.
Peabody suffered 'significant' costs from a strike in February, although not
the Pounds 15m claimed by the UMWA. The strike resumed in May after talks
broke down. Mr Ken Zinn, of the UMWA, said this one would cost Hanson 'much
more'.
Mr Zinn accused Peabody of setting up a new company, Premier Coal, which he
said would open non-union mines and so get round agreements on job security.
Mr Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, said Premier had applied for mining
licences but would not be opening any mines as the fall in the coal price
made the reserves uneconomic to mine.
Mr Engelhardt said the union mines were 28 per cent less productive and had
higher labour costs than non-union mines. He said Peabody wanted a contract
with the union which would make union mines competitive.

Heavitree Brewery, the USM-traded pub operator, produced profits of Pounds
401,000 pre-tax for the six months to April 30, against Pounds 232,000 last
time, restated for FRS 3.
Mr William Tucker, chairman of the Devon-based group, said the outcome -
struck after interest charges reduced from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 197,000
 -was some 2.5 per cent ahead of budget. 'There is good reason to anticipate
that the full year will see a return to our previous levels of profit,' he
added.
Turnover showed little change at Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 3.83m).
The Heavitree Inns subsidiary incurred an operating deficit of Pounds 80,000
but was on course for a profitable year, Mr Tucker said.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.6p, payable from earnings of 3.2p

MS International, the Doncaster-based engineer, lifted pre-tax profits to
Pounds 460,000 for the 12 months to May 1.
The outcome, on turnover of Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 30.5m), compared with
Pounds 251,000 last time, or a deficit of Pounds 1.52m restated for FRS 3.
At the operating level, profits jumped 90 per cent, from Pounds 330,000 to

despite the lack of recovery in the group's markets. 'There remained a
distinct reticence by customers to commit for capital projects', he said.
Net cash balances of Pounds 430,000 at the year end compared with borrowings
last time of Pounds 780,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 1p (losses of 5.5p under FRS 3) but the

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aukett cuts operating deficit
</HEADLINE>

CONCENTRATING on corporate markets is beginning to show benefits for Aukett
Associates, which provides integrated design and management services.
In the six months ended March 31 it cut its operating loss from Pounds
372,000 to Pounds 136,000. There were no exceptional charges this time,
against Pounds 202,000.
However, the pre-tax deficit doubled to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 1.16m) after
losses of Pounds 2.1m on sale of discontinued operation (Pounds 586,000
against investment in associate), losses from associates of Pounds 124,000
(Pounds 129,000), and net interest payable of Pounds 32,000 (Pounds 70,000).
Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, said he could not judge whether the company had
turned the corner, but believed current signs were encouraging.
Reductions in operating costs implemented over the past 18 months were
expected to show real benefits over the next 12 months.
They will be further enhanced by the 'considerable reduction' in borrowings
following the sale of Nathaniel Lichfield to management for Pounds 1m.
Losses per share came to 16.91p (7.31p).

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Caledonia advances by 38% to Pounds 36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALEDONIA Investments, the investment holding company 48 per cent owned by
the Cayzer family, increased pre-tax profits 38 per cent, from Pounds 26.1m
to Pounds 36m, in the year to March 31.
Net assets per share rose from 472p to 559p.
The shares rose 25p to 484p, compared to a price of 355p at which the group
bought back 10 per cent of its equity a year ago.
Results benefited from a first time contribution from the 27 per cent stake
in Exco, included for seven months, and a nine month (five month)
contribution from the 45 per cent owned Bristow Helicopters.
Profits from trading activities - subsidiary and associate companies - rose
from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 15.7m.
Such trading profits are expected to increase as a proportion of the whole,
but will mean slower dividend growth as the group believes a higher level of
cover is needed from trading earnings than from investment income.
Income from investments fell from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 12.9m, but the
comparable figure included Pounds 6.8m from British &amp; Commonwealth
preference shares. Net interest received dropped from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds
11m, as rates were lower and net cash balances fell from Pounds 206m to
Pounds 142m.
Cash represented about 30 per cent of shareholders' funds at the year end.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the net asset value might have risen
faster had that money been invested during the year, but Caledonia had taken
a selective attitude to investment opportunities.
There was a Pounds 700,000 loss on the sale of investments (Pounds 3.3m) and
no new provisions were made, compared to a Pounds 5.3m provision the
previous year.
Earnings per share were up from 18p to 26.1p, excluding the effect of losses
and provisions, or from 24.1p to 26.9p including them.
A final dividend of 10p is proposed to give a 15p (14.4p) total.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Birkby calls for Pounds 9m to fund buy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRKBY, which is involved in the provision of managed workspace, vehicle
hire and instalment credit, is calling for Pounds 9.2m, partly to fund the
acquisition of Hill Hire, a specialist in the hiring of heavy commercial
vehicles.
The rights issue, of 7.17m new shares, is on a 1-for-2 basis at 135p. It is
underwritten by Charterhouse Tilney.
Birkby, which reversed into Finlan Group last August, also announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.1m for the year to March 31. As the results included the
Birkby businesses for eight months they were not directly comparable with
previous restated losses of Pounds 4.32m.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 19.5m). Earnings per share came
through at 11.7p (1.2p losses) and a proposed final dividend of 2.53p makes
a total of 3.53p.
Mr Michael Woodhead, chairman, said that Finlan's two remaining trading
businesses, Witting Brothers and New Range Systems, had had a difficult
year.
Hill Hire is being acquired for an initial Pounds 4m in cash and Pounds
500,000 in shares. Further consideration, up to Pounds 2m, is profit
related. In the six months to March 31 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
424,000.
In addition to funding the acquisition, proceeds from the rights issue will
be used to provide further working capital for the expansion of all the
group's main divisions.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Domino declines 19% as US drive fails to
pay off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Domino Printing Sciences, the Cambridge-based continuous
ink jet printer maker, fell 19 per cent, from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 3.73m,
at the half way stage in line with the warning in March.
Sales and gross profits were well ahead, but heavy investment in marketing
and distribution in the US had so far failed to pay off, according to Mr
Howard Whitesmith, group managing director.
Turnover for the six months to April 30 rose to Pounds 37.6m, an improvement
of 22 per cent on the Pounds 31m recorded last year. Earnings per share were
down 18 per cent at 9.35p (11.46p). The interim dividend is 2.65p (2.4p).
The balance sheet shows net cash of Pounds 16.4m.
Gross profits grew 21 per cent to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 13.5m) but selling
and distribution costs rose 45 per cent to Pounds 8.31m, the result
principally of taking on an additional 14 sales people, together with
support staff, in the US in anticipation of a sales boom that had yet to
arrive.
Mr Whitesmith believed potential customers were delaying purchases while
they assessed the effect on business of the Clinton administration. He said
there were indications that the situation would improve in the second half,
traditionally the stronger part of Domino's business cycle.
Domino, together with Videojet, a US-based subsidiary of GEC, dominates the
world market for industrial ink-jet printers, used to mark sell-by dates and
batch numbers on a variety of foods, beverages and drugs. They are also used
to imprint part numbers on fast moving production lines. Domino has only an
18 per cent share of the US market compared with 55 per cent in Europe.
According to Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, sales in the UK and France were
strong, but Germany and the Netherlands remained difficult. The boom in
ink-jet printing resulting from legislation in Europe demanding the
labelling of foods and beverages has now levelled off, and ink-jet printer
makers are seeking new outlets for their products.
The shares, which fell 44p to 552p on the March profits warning, rose 6p
yesterday to 469p.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rodime at Dollars 0.8m but warns on year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RODIME, the disk drive pioneer which now strives to make its living by
licensing and patenting its technology, stayed in the black in the six
months ended March 31 1993, making a pre-tax profit of Dollars 815,000
(Pounds 543,000).
However, the company warned it might not be able to maintain the profitable
trend over the full year. In the comparable period Rodime incurred a loss of
Dollars 644,000 but turned that into a profit of Dollars 1.69m by the
year-end.
The Scottish company, which produced the first 3.5 inch disk drive in
Scotland in the early 1980s, is suing Seagate, the big US disk drive maker,
for wilful infringement of its patents. It is also in litigation with Maxtor
and Quantum, two other leading US disk drive makers.
Mr Peter Bailey, managing director, said the litigation with Seagate was
'making progress' but the case was not expected to come to court in the US
until the first half of next year. Rodime successfully sued International
Business Machines for patent infringement in 1990. It believes a victory
over Seagate, which it alleges has infringed its patents on about Dollars
3bn worth of products, could be lucrative.
Mr Bailey said several other disk drive makers which Rodime claims have
infringed its patents were waiting for the outcome of the Seagate case
before settling with Rodime. The company had planned on at least some of
them settling before the Seagate case was concluded, reaching licensing or
patent agreements and paying money to Rodime.
It has negotiated increased facilities with the Bank of Scotland as it could
be faced with increased litigation costs and reduced licensing income.
Rodime achieved only one license agreement in the half year, receiving a
'modest single payment' from Sony Corporation of Japan.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 60m tag on Business Post - Shares
placed with institutions at 120p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Business Post Group have been placed with institutions at 120p per
share, giving the UK's biggest independent parcel and express mail company a
market value of Pounds 60m.
The placing will raise Pounds 15m, of which Pounds 12m will go to the the
group and the rest to its owners, Mr Peter Kane, chairman, and his brother,
Michael, managing director.
The price of the placing, organised by Barings and UBS, puts the shares on a
historic earnings multiple of 17 and gives a notional dividend yield of 3
per cent and cover of 2.4 times.
Founded in 1971 Business Post has - in spite of recession - increased
turnover over the past three years at a compound annual rate of 41 per cent.
In the year to March, it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m on sales of
Pounds 33.7m.
Mr Peter Kane said: 'We have grown rapidly in size and profitability in the
last three years. We believe that we only have a market share of 4 per cent
in the UK and are confident that we can continue to expand our overnight
parcel and express mail business.'
He said some Pounds 6.4m of the flotation proceeds would be spent in the
expansion of the group's national hub in Birmingham, the development of new
regional hubs in Leeds, Manchester and Bristol, and - subject to finding
suitable sites - the purchase and development of new regional hubs in
Reading and central London.
An increase in operating margin to 14 per cent in the 12 months to March
this year was attributed to further economies achieved by the opening of the
Birmingham hub in 1992, and tight cost controls.
COMMENT
Business Post has flourished impressively, not least by targeting smaller
businesses which send a limited number of packages every day. It also
eschews advertising, instead getting salesmen from the group and its
franchisees to 'knock on doors' of prospective customers. The placing was
comfortably oversubscribed, and the shares are likely go to a comfortable
premium when trading begins on Monday. However, liquidity will be limited by
the vendors' decision to hold on to 75 per cent of the equity. The group
seems confident of maintaining its rapid growth record but that is likely to
be reflected in the rating - even after any stags exit.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Securicor ahead 27% despite flat outcome
from Cellnet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURICOR, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a 27
per cent increase in profits despite flat results from Cellnet, its 40 per
cent owned mobile telephone network.
Pre-tax profits rose from a restated Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 28.9m in the six
months to March 31. The increase would have been a modest 7 per cent on a
pre-FRS 3 accounting basis.
Security Services, the 50.75 per cent owned subsidiary where most of the
group's operating companies are held, expanded profits 36 per cent to Pounds
20.1m (Pounds 14.7m).
Mr Christopher Shirtcliffe, finance director, described the overall results
as 'impressive'. Turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 317.6m, helped by
last year's acquisitions of Federal Express' UK parcel business
Cellnet's pre-tax contribution fell from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 21.4m.
Profits were dented by marketing costs for the new Lifetime service,
launched six months ago. Neither Securicor nor BT, which owns the remaining
60 per cent of the network, has disclosed start up costs for Lifetime, which
has built up just over 100,000 subscribers.
The security division lifted profits from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 3.76m,
although the rise was flattered by prior year restructuring costs.
Parcels, which operates as Securicor Omega Express, increased profits 10 per
cent to Pounds 3.3m; but that stemmed from the Federal Express purchase and
the company said overcapacity in UK parcels meant margins were slipping.
Securicor's communications division, which excludes Cellnet and mainly
involves cellular retailing, continued to lose money because of its small
subscriber base, although losses were reduced from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
2.4m.
Earnings, helped by a lower tax charge, increased 59 per cent to 14p (8.8p).
Earnings at Security Services almost doubled, again helped by a lower tax
charge, to 12.2p (6.3p).
Both companies raised their interim dividends by 10 per cent to 0.732p and
1.533p respectively.
COMMENT
Results at the top end of expectations sent Securicor's A shares up 11p to
645p. After a poor start to the year, the shares have added 15 per cent
since April as analysts became more sanguine about competition threats to
Cellnet from new entrants like Mercury. The threat remains, of course, and
its shadow can be seen in the unspecified start-up costs incurred to gain
market share for Lifetime. But for the longer term the shares are
underpinned by the eventual likelihood that BT will make Securicor the offer
it cannot refuse. Until then the company's managed businesses offer solid,
if unspectacular growth. Full year profits forecasts of Pounds 65m put the
shares on just under 21 times, which looks about right.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Seeboard increases dividend by 15.9% -
Several hundred jobs to go in cost-saving exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEEBOARD took the electricity sector's dividend increases to a new high
yesterday by announcing a 15.9 per cent rise in its total pay-out, narrowly
capping Northern Electric's 15.6 per cent rise announced on Monday.
Seeboard will also be favouring shareholders by advancing the payment date
for the final dividend by six weeks to August 23.
The final is 14.3p, bringing the total for the year to March 31 to 20p.
At the same time, however, the company announced that several hundred jobs
would be lost in a cost-saving exercise.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said: 'Seeboard delivered a strong performance
in 1992-93 with increased profits, substantial progress in improving
efficiency and positive action to reduce the cost of electricity for our
customers.'
Electricity prices for households and small businesses will be reduced by
3.3 per cent in September.
The Hove-based company announced a 14.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit
from Pounds 98.4m to Pounds 112.7m. Earnings per share rose 15.9 per cent
from 53.5p to 62p.
The greatest part of the increase came from the supply business, where
operating profit rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 13.3m.
By contrast, the distribution business, which accounts for the bulk of
earnings, was virtually unchanged at Pounds 91.9m. Units of electricity sold
fell by 1.5 per cent, reflecting the recession.
Other activities, which include the retailing business, made an overall
surplus of Pounds 1.5m, up from Pounds 300,000. Southern Gas, the company's
one-year-old gas trading venture, made a trading profit of Pounds 700,000,
and now has 700 customers at 3,000 sites.
Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, said that the company was being restructured
to create self-contained businesses and a smaller corporate head office at a
new location in Crawley. This would reduce jobs by 500-600, on top of the
500 which the company has already shed since privatisation.
'There is a major cultural change going through the company to put the focus
on profits, results and shareholder value,' he said.
COMMENT
Although the generous dividend helped boost the share price by 10p to 520p,
the market was just as pleased by Seeboard's aggressive attitude towards
costs. Its aim of being the industry's most efficient member puts it in a
good position to deal with whatever comes out of Offer's pricing reviews.
Management also took a conservative line on diversification yesterday,
promising not to be tempted by its low gearing to undertake exotic ventures.
At last night's close, the shares yielded just under 5 per cent, the lowest
in the sector, confirming Seeboard's place as the market's favourite REC,
but analysts warned that the early dividend payment could cause some
disruptions.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Danka makes three acquisitions in US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DANKA BUSINESS Systems, which distributes office equipment and related
supplies and services in the US, has made three acquisitions there which
will add Dollars 21m (Pounds 14m) in revenues to its existing operations.
The acquisitions of Layne's Copy Product Company, Business Copy Products and
Midwest Toner Distributors and its five affiliated companies, brings the
total number of purchases announced by Danka since April 1 to seven.
Danka will issue shares for the outstanding stock in Virginia-based Layne's
in a Dollars 2.9m deal. In 1992 Layne's reported revenues of Dollars 5.9m
and pre-tax profits of Dollars 532,000.
BCP, a Minolta and Savin copier dealer in Lubbock, Texas, reported revenues
of Dollars 2.8m and pre-tax profits of Dollars 400,000 in the year to June
30 1992. Danka will pay Dollars 1.35m in cash and assume certain deferred
revenue liabilities up to a maximum Dollars 300,000.
Danka will issue 209,000 shares and pay Dollars 1.14m cash for Midwest,
which operates out of a distribution centre in St Louis, Missouri. In the
year ended June 1992, Midwest reported wholesale and retail revenues of
Dollars 7m and Dollars 5m respectively and pre-tax profits of Dollars
500,000.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ascot poised to return as loss is cut to
Pounds 79.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASCOT HOLDINGS, the renamed Control Securities, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 79.6m in the year to March 31, down from the previous deficit of
Pounds 196.2m.
The property, brewing and leisure group finalised a financial restructuring
on June 17 and its shares, suspended since October 1991, are expected to
resume trading today.
Mr Howard Dyer, the new chairman, said the 1992-93 year had been 'traumatic'
with 'the very survival of the group in jeopardy'. With the refinancing now
in place, though, the group 'is entering a period of stability.' It aims to
sell assets to cut debt, while concentrating on its pub activities.
Mr John Kerslake, finance director, said the group was achieving disposals
in line with the business plan agreed with the banks. However, selling
properties on yields higher than current interest rates would have an
adverse impact on profits.
He said trading was difficult in the pub estate, with a price war raging,
although occupancy rates were improving at the hotels. The Belhaven brewery,
which is for sale, had increased market share. Retail properties were in
demand.
The balance sheet at the year end showed negative net worth of Pounds 50.6m.
The accounts have been qualified by the auditors on a going concern basis.
A pro-forma balance sheet, taking account of the restructuring, showed a net
deficit of Pounds 16.4m, an improvement of Pounds 34.2m, which relates to
the exchange of Pounds 89m of bonds for Pounds 66.8m of new bonds plus
convertible shares. Bank debt stood at Pounds 163.2m at the year end.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 97.9m to Pounds 120.4m but this included
asset disposals. Operating profits fell from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 22.2m,
but associate losses were down from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 118,000.
Exceptional costs were Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 193.4m) most of which were
revealed in the interim figures. Interest charges were Pounds 30m (Pounds
27.3m). The retained loss was Pounds 80.9m (Pounds 192.4m) with losses per
share 21.8p (51.8p).

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology Pounds 13m loss
'within budget'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Bio-technology, the pharmaceuticals group that floated last year
with a market capitalisation of Pounds 150m, yesterday reported losses of
Pounds 13.1m, 'well within budget'.
More importantly for a lossmaking start-up company that is investing across
a number of development projects, British Bio-technology said it had limited
the cash outflow to Pounds 14.5m and still had about Pounds 50m of cash in
the bank.
The pre-tax loss rose from Pounds 11.6m and cash outflow increased from
Pounds 11.8m in the year ending April 30 1992. Losses per share were 37.5p
(44.9p).
The group also said it had agreed in principle to sell British
Bio-technology Products, its research reagent and assays subsidiary, to
Techne Corp of the US for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.53m) in cash.
Techne is also to make research payments of Dollars 5m over four years in
exchange for diagnostic product rights.
Mr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, said the group had taken the view it
was a drugs company and would prefer to sell its products business rather
than spend more to expand it.
He said the group had passed the milestones it said it would pass at
flotation. From two drugs in clinical trials, the group now had five in
trial. Three of these were in Phase II clinical trials.
Mr McCullagh said that historically the biggest capital value increases for
successful US companies had been enjoyed when their drugs were going through
the Phase II clinical trial phase. 'We are well past the maximum risk
point,' he said.
COMMENT
With another tranche of development capital almost certainly required in the
next two years - long before any profits become visible - one wonders
whether British Bio-technology shouldn't still be financed by venture
capital. Granted the company has hit the targets for pushing drugs into
phase II clinical trials. And it has the highest reputation for research and
can boast alliances with the likes of SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo. But
British Bio-tech's research programme remains tiny by pharmaceutical
industry standards, however novel some of the underlying science. The
research may simply not pay off and investors could be left with few other
eggs in few other baskets. Or perhaps not. The trouble with the emerging
bio-science sector in the UK is that, unlike in the US, stock analysts and
institutional investors with real knowledge of bio-science are all too
scarce. Investing in the sector will undoubtedly have its thrills - but for
some time will resemble a visit to the gaming table.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti seeks cash injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI International, which came close to collapse following the 1989
discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, its US
subsidiary, is seeking a strategic partner to take a minority equity stake
and help strengthen its shrunken balance sheet.
Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman of the electronics and defence company since
1990, said it was looking for 'a substantial cash injection,' which would
help ease tight liquidity problems and enable it to wipe out Pounds 19m of
overdue creditors payments.
Ferranti has cut its bank borrowings from Pounds 700m to under Pounds 100m
since 1989 and reduced its overdue creditors payments from Pounds 55m, but
Mr Anderson said the process needed to be accelerated. 'I should like to
operate with a little less adversity,' he said.
He said the group has already held talks with a number of unidentified
potential partners but had not yet reached an agreement. Asked if Ferranti
had been warned away from a rights issue, Mr Anderson answered that the
group's financial advisers 'believe the strategy we are following is the
right one.'
Yesterday the group reported a reduced, but slightly larger than expected
Pounds 24.5m pre-tax loss in the year to March 31 compared to a restated
Pounds 46.2m loss the previous year. The latest accounts have been produced
on the basis of the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
Losses per share were 2.43p (4.71p). The share price fell 3p to 11 3/4 p
after the announcement.
Turnover fell to Pounds 230.9m (Pounds 362.6m) including Pounds 216.9m
(Pounds 243.9m) from continuing operations and the group posted an operating
loss of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 9.7m) including a Pounds 3m (Pounds 3.3m) loss
attributable to continuing operations.
The group also incurred non-operating costs of Pounds 7m (Pounds 23.8m), but
interest costs declined to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 13.5m).

Directors who left Brent Walker, the pubs, betting shops and property group,
during 1992 received compensation of Pounds 240,000 for loss of office.
During the year Lord Kindersley, the chairman, resigned. The compensation
did not include payments to Mr Ken Scobie, who resigned as chief executive
in January this year, or Mrs Jean Walker, wife of former chairman Mr George
Walker, whose compensation was fixed after the year-end. Those payments
together are expected to exceed Pounds 1m.
The accounts show the highest paid director received Pounds 638,000 during
1992. This was Mr John Brown, head of the betting shop division, who was
entitled to a bonus of Pounds 467,000 relating to Rapid Raceline, a business
he set up and sold to William Hill.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Halma at Pounds 21m as growth continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of sterling helped Halma, the safety and environmental
technology group, maintain its strong record of growing profits and exports.
Pre-tax profits increased by 47 per cent to Pounds 20.9m in the 53 weeks to
April 3, under FRS 3, and by 35 per cent under the old accounting
conventions. Sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 116m. Overseas sales rose by
35 per cent to Pounds 59.8m and direct exports from the group's UK companies
rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 31.8m.
The group said its net profit margin on sales increased from 16.4 to 18 per
cent and its overall return on capital employed was, at 45 per cent, in
excess of 40 per cent for the 10th consecutive year.
Mr David Barber, chairman, was encouraged that the group had been able to
achieve these figures during a difficult period for the UK economy.
Halma's net cash balances rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 8.5m, although the
group spent Pounds 4.5m on acquiring businesses and had capital expenditure
of Pounds 5.39m.
Mr Barber said that during the 15 months since March 1992, Halma had bought
eight companies and formed four businesses, bringing the total number of
operating companies to 43. He said all the acquired companies had continued
to trade satisfactorily.
Earnings per share rose by 43 per cent to 9.93p (6.92p) under FRS 3,
equivalent to 29 per cent under previous rules. A final dividend of 1.6p
(1.332p) is proposed for a total of 2.636p (2.195p). There is also a 1-for-3
scrip issue.
COMMENT
Even allowing for the strong benefit which sterling's devaluation brought in
the second half, these are very impressive figures. Halma continues to
benefit from legislation which requires investment in industrial safety,
water treatment and gas and fire detection. It can also point to a strong
performance by companies that supply electronic sensors for lifts and
service the US semi-conductor market. The shares, which rose 8p to 256p,
have had a strong run since the beginning of 1991 and are on a prospective
multiple of more than 22. The premium rating is justified, but the shares
look fully valued.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Celsis valued at Pounds 60m as placing is
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Celsis, a new medical diagnostic company, were yesterday placed at
100p, valuing the company that hopes to replace the laboratory agar plate,
at about Pounds 60m.
Panmure Gordon said the placing of 15m shares with institutions was
comfortably oversubscribed. The intermediaries offer of 7m shares, which
have been conditionally placed, closes on Friday.
The company will raise Pounds 12.4m from the float. Existing shareholders
have sold 9m shares.
In a novel development related to bio-technology and start-up companies, the
Stock Exchange has insisted that no existing shareholders can sell any of
their holdings for two years.
This condition forms part of new rules being developed to allow new bio-tech
companies to come to market without a track record.
Celsis is developing a system for rapid diagnosis of microbial contamination
which it hopes will replace the agar plate.
The company does not expect to launch the product till the end of next year
and will not make make significant profits until 1995.
COMMENT
Celsis has clearly generated strong support among institutions. Part of this
is no doubt the result of the impressive team Chris Evans, the founder, has
brought together. Part will stem from a desire to build a portfolio in the
new and potentially exciting bio-science sector, which seems also likely to
include a number of diagnostic companies. But companies like Celsis, with no
proven product, remain stocks to leave out of Granny's portfolio - unless
she is a high roller. Reasons for why Celsis should be valued at Pounds 60m
 -not Pounds 80m, Pounds 40m or less - are more elusive than brief
explanations of the use of bioluminescence reagents in microbe detection.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 10p discount for BT investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK PRIVATE investors will receive a 10p discount in the first instalment of
the Pounds 5bn sale of the government's remaining tranche of shares in
British Telecommunications.
The first instalment for investors in the international offer is to be 160p;
the overall price, which will determine the sum payable in the third
instalment, is to be determined after the international offer has closed on
July 16.
The closing date for registration with share shops of the share information
service is this Friday. Registration gives preferential treatment in
allocations for the UK public offer, which closes on July 14.
Dealing in the partly-paid shares starts on July 19.
Launching the prospectus yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, said the offer was shaped to 'help achieve one of our more
cherished long-term ambitions of wider share ownership.'
The shares will be allocated equally between the UK public offer and the
international offer, but the government is reserving the right to increase
the proportion available to UK investors to 67 per cent 'in the light of
demand.'
Mr Clarke said that 4.7m registrations had been made to date, 1.4m with
share shops and 1.3m with the share information service. At the close of the
registration period for the last government sale of BT shares, 5.3m had
registered.
The details of the offer were as expected by the City, although the discount
is 5p less than that on offer at the sale of the last tranche of government
BT shares in November 1991.
Two dividends will be declared on the partly-paid shares within six months.
The first will be a net 9.45p paid in September. An interim dividend will
also be payable before the second instalment is due next March.
Some 2.4m existing shareholders and employees are automatically registered
for shares. In the allocation, BT shareholders get preferential treatment,
with allocations 50 per cent higher than non-shareholders.
Employees are guaranteed about 2,000 shares.
The minimum application for retail investors in the UK public offer is 120
shares. Larger investors and institutions must enter the retail tender -
which is part of the international offer - where the minimum application is
2,000 shares, except for Pep applicants who can apply for a minimum of
1,000.
Bookbuilding for the international offer will start on July 8.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Waddington falls 16% to Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES ON the disposal of a subsidiary depressed profits at John Waddington,
the packaging, printing and games company which yesterday revealed a 16 per
cent decline at the pre-tax level to Pounds 6.1m for the year to April 3.
The results - according to new accounting standard FRS 3 which, in effect,
eliminates extraordinary charges - showed a Pounds 9m loss on the disposal
of the business forms subsidiary. Excluding the loss, operating profits rose
by 14 per cent to Pounds 18.1m on sales 4 per cent lower at Pounds 221.6m.
The shares closed 11p higher at 230p.
Mr Martin Buckley, chief executive, said the disposal of business forms for
Pounds 1.3m had eliminated annual trading losses of Pounds 1.8m.
Meanwhile, Waddington's core packaging operations in the US and UK had
performed particularly well following the heavy capital expenditure
programme of the last five years. Profits were ahead by 7 per cent to Pounds
12.3m on static sales of Pounds 125.6m.
The growth was expected to continue this year, with the most significant
opportunities in the US.
The performance in packaging was dampened by a disappointing performance
from the labels division. The loss of a substantial contract with Heinz last
year had adversely affected this business, leaving it with losses of Pounds
900,000. However, this included one-off redundancy costs of Pounds 400,000.
Mr Buckley expected the labels operation to approach break-even by the
year-end.
The final dividend is maintained at 4.3p, for a maintained total of 7.9p.
Earnings under FRS 3 fell from 4.93p to 3.19p. However, stripping out the
loss on disposals, they rose from 11.6p to 13.71p.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Murdoch Asian TV deal fails at first hurdle: Expansion move
founders on ownership laws and complaints from Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's bid to enter Asian broadcasting through a HKDollars
1.85bn (Pounds 160m) purchase of 22 per cent of Hong Kong's Television
Broadcasts (TVB) was on the verge of collapse yesterday. He was forced to
ask the Hong Kong government to defer its consideration of the acquisition.
His plan to acquire a substantial shareholding in TVB appears to have
foundered on Hong Kong's tough media ownership laws and complaints from
China concerning the deal. It was unclear last night how the transaction
could be restructured to avoid these problems.
Mr Murdoch's News Corporation said discussions were continuing with TVB's
two controlling shareholders - Sir Run Run Shaw and Mr Robert Kuok, the
Malaysian financier. More time was required 'to examine the structure of
their proposals to the government and the Broadcasting Authority'.
Earlier this month Mr Murdoch said he had forged an alliance with Sir Run
Run and Mr Kuok which would create 'the premier Asian company in terrestrial
and satellite broadcasting'. After the deal Sir Run Run would own 23 per
cent of the company, News Corporation 22 per cent and Mr Kuok 21 per cent.
But the proposed deal drew hostility from Hong Kong legislators and the
local journalists' association, who fear the concentration of media power.
It also ran up against what appear to be insuperable regulatory problems.
Hong Kong does not permit an existing broadcaster to own more than 15 per
cent of a local television licensee. Nor does it permit a foreigner to vote
more than 10 per cent of a licensee's equity.
Mr Murdoch would require exemptions from the government for the TVB deal to
proceed. But it emerged yesterday that such exemptions were unlikely to be
given.
Neither the government nor the Broadcasting Authority 'could see good reason
for bending the rules', one Hong Kong government official said. 'I think it
is the end of it.' Mr Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday cleared a final
big hurdle in its bid to take over the ailing tabloid New York Post when the
Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the
media industry, gave the takeover its approval, writes Martin Dickson in New
York.
The FCC, by a two to one vote, gave Mr Murdoch a waiver of its rule which
normally bars a company or individual from owning both a television station
and a newspaper in the same market. News Corporation, which also owns the
New York TV station WNYW, has been operating the Post since March under a
temporary FCC waiver. Mr Murdoch owned the Post, which is now in bankruptcy
proceedings, until 1988, when he was forced to sell it to comply with the
cross-ownership rules.

FT  30 JUN 93 / China is the key to ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rupert Murdoch is not a man who often makes mistakes. But the obstacles to
him using Hong Kong as a launching pad for his Asian broadcasting ambitions
were such that initial failure should come as no surprise.
His bid to own 22 per cent of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts ran counter
to at least three legislative prohibitions. His side deal with TVB's
controlling shareholders, Sir Run Run Shaw and Mr Robert Kuok, to increase
his stake to about 33 per cent compounded the problem.
Hong Kong broadcasting law is written with the presumption that foreign
ownership will be refused. Exemptions are needed for a foreigner to vote
more than 10 per cent of a licensee's stock and for an existing broadcaster
to own more than 15 per cent of a licensee. Mr Murdoch's ownership of Fox
Television of the US puts him at odds with the latter.
To obtain these exemptions, Mr Murdoch would have to produce compelling
evidence of how the public interest would be served.
The logic for Mr Murdoch of the TVB deal can be summed up in one word:
China. It is the emerging television market in north east Asia and TVB alone
has the wherewithal to make commercial Chinese broadcasting work. It is the
dominant terrestrial broadcaster in Hong Kong with a Chinese language
channel that reaches an estimated 16m viewers in neighbouring Guangdong. It
has recently entered satellite broadcasting in Asia.
Mr Murdoch hoped to marry his abilities in managing a satellite broadcaster
with TVB's control of Chinese language programming. It produces 5,000 hours
of Chinese programming annually and has a library of more than 100,000 hours
of material. Indeed, it has been estimated that TVB's library is equivalent
to 60 per cent of Asia's stock of Chinese language material, excluding
communist China.
Mr Murdoch has been assiduous in his cultivation of Chinese leaders. He
first visited China in the early 1980s and earlier this year he spent a week
in Beijing meeting the leadership. His Fox Television distributes movies in
China and houses a Chinese government censor in Hong Kong.
It was, however, becoming increasingly clear that China had reservations
about the proposed deal. Media in China is controlled by the Communist
party, which takes seriously what mainland Chinese view and read.
Late last week, the semi-official China News Agency in Hong Kong reminded
the colonial government that 'deep thought' was required before a decision
was made. The phraseology was low key, but the message was clear: don't do
this.
As one British diplomat observed: 'The Chinese want to have as few
uncontrollable influences on the media as possible after 1997' - the date at
which sovereignty reverts.
Chinese opposition to the deal also appears to be impervious to the
entreaties of Sir Run Run and Mr Kuok, both of whom have longstanding
connections in Beijing. As one TVB executive said last night: 'Connections
are one thing but whether they are useful in this case is another matter.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Renault and Volvo fortify links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT, the state-owned French vehicle maker, and Sweden's Volvo said
yesterday they were setting up a department to plan joint car production,
adding momentum to an alliance which appears to be heading towards a merger.
The 'joint strategic and product planning department', to be set up by
September, will succeed a joint planning committee and create a common
management team for planning and co-ordinating the range of cars made by the
partners.
Both companies, which entered an alliance in 1990, stressed they would
retain the distinct identities of the Renault and Volvo marques, and
separate production. But they would deepen co-operation on what cars each
produced in different classes of vehicle and on shared use of components.
The move coincides with negotiations over a possible merger, which hinge on
the French government's privatisation plans for Renault.
A privatisation bill is due to be passed by the French parliament next month
which would allow Volvo to increase its 20 per cent stake in Renault and
open the way for private French investors to take up Renault stock.
Renault at present holds 8 per cent of the Volvo parent company and 25 per
cent of the Volvo car company.
The new joint planning department is the latest development in steadily
growing co-operation between Renault and Volvo. Already they make some 20
per cent of their annual purchases - worth some Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) -
together to achieve lower supply prices.
The companies already have joint quality projects, some shared marketing and
distribution and are jointly developing a commuter bus.
Volvo's Dutch car production plant is to use Renault diesel engines and
Renault plans to use a Volvo two-litre petrol engine for one of its future
models. The two are also working on project called P4 which envisages each
company producing two executive car models built on a common platform.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Granada pays premium to increase its stake in LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA Group yesterday surprised the ITV sector by paying Pounds 67m for a
14.99 per cent stake in London Weekend Television, the maximum possible
under present rules.
Granada paid a considerable premium - 500p a share compared with Monday's
price of 375p. Yesterday LWT's share price rose from 375p to 466p.
The move is a clear indication that Granada - which also has interests in
leisure, TV rental and computer services - plans to expand in the television
market.
Earlier this year the company, which holds the north west England franchise
and is famous for programmes such as Coronation Street and World in Action,
was beaten to a stake in Yorkshire Television by LWT.
Yesterday Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, insisted that the
deal was 'a stand-alone investment' rather than a gamble that the rules on
ownership of ITV companies will be relaxed.
Current legislation says that the nine largest ITV companies cannot take
each other over because of fears about concentration of ownership.
The government has made it clear that it is prepared to consider relaxing
the rules.
Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, said yesterday:
'Granada has almost certainly done this in the hope that the rules will
change. It would be too much to pay for a trade investment.'
The shares of companies which are seen as attractive takeover targets -
particularly Central and Scottish, which pay only Pounds 2,000 a year for
their franchises, and Anglia - are expected to rise.
The Granada purchase gives the company two options. If the rules change, it
could make a full bid for LWT. An alternative would be to use the LWT stake
as a counter in a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman, yesterday described himself as
'neutral' on the deal, but an admirer of the way Mr Robinson was managing
Granada.
The deal is likely to make more than 40 LWT managers richer. If the LWT
share price is above 278p in September the managers will get four ordinary
shares for every management share. When the share price stood at 385p the
management shares were worth a total of Pounds 55m.
The managers are now likely to share Pounds 65m.

FT  30 JUN 93 / BAT swaps tobacco brands with rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries and American Brands, the rival tobacco groups, are to swap
some cigarette brands as part of a drive towards pan-European marketing.
The move, a rare example of consumer companies swapping brands to simplify
their ownership, was announced yesterday as BAT revealed that the cigarette
price war in the US would reduce first-half trading profits at its Brown &amp;
Williamson subsidiary by Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m). The problem lay in
excessive stocks of its full-price US brands, notably Kool.
BAT will acquire from American Brands the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall
cigarette businesses in France. In exchange, American Brands will get BAT's
Benson &amp; Hedges operations in the duty-paid markets of the European
Community and European Free Trade Area.
As part of the deal, prompted by the creation of the European single market,
American Brands will pay BAT about Pounds 135m - Pounds 70m in cash with the
balance paid over 10 years according to B&amp;H sales.
The Pounds 135m will be included as a pre-tax profit in BAT's accounts for
1993. The net trading profit foregone is estimated at about Pounds 8m a
year.
The arrangements have been approved by the EC Commission.
Mr Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT's tobacco business, said: 'This
is a key development which will enable the group to build on the continuing
success of Lucky Strike in Europe by focusing on the brand and unifying its
marketing.'
BAT, which owns the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall trademarks in the rest of
Europe, will continue to license the brands in France to Seita, the
state-owned tobacco company. Sales of Lucky Strike in France have increased
by 27 per cent a year since 1989 to 1.2bn cigarettes and BAT believes it
offers scope for development across Europe.
BAT's worldwide Lucky Strike volume, which has grown by 18 per cent a year
to 17.1bn since 1989, will also benefit from the deal which extends its
rights to the brand into the US duty-free trade and a number of other
markets, including the Philippines, Algeria and Cuba.
American Brands will retain control of the US domestic market where the
brand's sales volume amounted to 1.7bn last year.
Gallaher, the British subsidiary of the US group, which owns the Benson &amp;
Hedges brand in the UK and Ireland, will now manufacture and market the
brand throughout the rest of western Europe.
However, BAT - which owns the biggest UK export brand, State Express 555 -
will retain control of the B&amp;H brand in European duty-free and other
international markets.
Sales of B&amp;H in Europe last year accounted for 3bn of total worldwide volume
of 17bn.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Express publisher seeks Pounds 190m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, yesterday
announced a one-for-five rights to raise Pounds 190m.
The publishing group, with interests ranging from regional newspapers and
business magazines to exhibitions, said the aim of the rights issue was to
reduce debt, running at an estimated Pounds 300m, and to provide scope for
expansion.
'A number of opportunities for expanding existing publishing and exhibition
interests are being actively pursued in the US and Far East,' the company
said.
The price of the new shares was set at 480p and the issue was fully
underwritten by Samuel Montague.
Mr David Foster, media analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court, said that
the reaction of institutions to the rights issue had been 'somewhat
grudging' mainly because there was no obvious sign of imminent takeover
deals.
The deal would involve a 10 per cent dilution of earnings next year and
further uncertainty could be caused in the autumn if the government again
considered the possibility of imposing VAT on newspapers and magazines.
The rights issue follows a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in 1992
from Pounds 77.6m to Pounds 99.5m, excluding exceptional items. Earnings per
share rose from 10.9p to 40.1p.
United's directors forecast that pre-tax profits for the first six months of
this year will exceed the Pounds 46.5m achieved in the first half of 1992.
Mr Graham Wilson, finance director, said that the company needed to
strengthen its capital base. It was more honest to raise the money in one go
rather than in a series of small rights issues associated with acquisitions.
In the past five years United said it had invested more than Pounds 700m in
capital expenditure and in rationalising the business.
It is also clear that United is likely to raise more cash through the sale
of Extel, its financial information company.
Although United emphasised that a sale was not under active consideration,
Extel is seen as a non-core business that would probably be sold if the
right offer came along.
The company's share price closed at 574p last night, down 11p.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Bonn agrees Pounds 9.8bn savings: Cuts plan arouses fury but
may pave way for lower interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN

<TEXT>
LEADERS OF Germany's ruling coalition agreed yesterday to savings worth
DM25bn (Pounds 9.85bn), chiefly in social spending. They prompted a furious
reaction from trade unions and opposition leaders.
At the heart of the programme is a 3 percentage point cut in labour market,
unemployment and social assistance payments, combined with a time limit on
payment of earnings-related benefits, saving DM14bn in 1994 and up to DM16bn
a year by 1996.
The aim is to keep the 1994 federal government budget deficit about DM68bn,
as forecast this year, and in following years to cut the net borrowing
requirement from 15 per cent to 10 per cent of the federal budget.
The cuts, in providing some evidence of control of public spending, might
open the way for the Bundesbank to make further interest rate cuts. They
will also head off criticism of Germany's tight monetary policy and fiscal
laxity at next month's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations in Tokyo.
The plan was condemned by Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy leader of the
German trade union federation, who said it was the most drastic assault on
unemployment benefits since the early 1930s. 'That had catastrophic effects
on the Weimar republic,' she said, referring to the ill-fated German
democracy overthrown by the Nazis.
It was also greeted with scepticism by the banking community, where the
DM25bn savings at federal government and state government levels in 1994,
rising to almost DM35bn by 1996, are seen by many as inadequate.
Mr Helmut Geiger, retiring president of the savings banks association, said
the real 'horror scenario' remained from 1995 onwards. Only then would the
full effect of borrowing for unification, by organisations such as the
Treuhand privatisation agency and the German Unity Fund, fall on the federal
budget.
The plan was presented jointly by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, and Mr Norbert Blum, the labour
minister, as a great success for the ruling coalition.
Given the sharp downturn in the German economy, the plan, they said, was
intended to strengthen growth prospects and revive Germany's reputation as
an investment location.
The coalition parties still face a fierce battle to push the cuts through
the German parliament. Mr Rudolf Dressler, deputy leader of the Social
Democratic party and social affairs spokesman, said the cuts would be
opposed 'with all the political means at our disposal'.

FT  30 JUN 93 / London parking fines double as powers pass to councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFIC LAWS that start to take effect tomorrow herald the toughest
clampdown on illegal parking in London since traffic wardens began pounding
the beat in 1960.
The Pounds 30 penalty for illegal parking will double to Pounds 60 in
central London; at least 1,000 traffic wardens will join the 1,500 already
on patrol; and computer technology will be deployed to crack down on
persistent offenders.
The new regime is being introduced under the Road Traffic Act 1991, which
gives the government powers to transfer responsibility for parking
enforcement from the police to local authorities.
It is modelled on schemes introduced over the past two years in US cities
such as Chicago which have succeeded in cutting congestion and increasing
traffic speeds.
The law permitting the London scheme comes into effect at midnight tonight,
but the transfer of responsibility will be phased in area by area over the
next 12 months.
Under the existing system, traffic wardens are employed by the Metropolitan
Police - although some local authorities engage additional wardens to patrol
parking meters and residents' parking spaces.
In future, police wardens will concentrate on patrolling the capital's main
roads, soon to be redesignated 'red routes' with stricter curbs on parking.
The rest of the capital's roads will be the responsibility of local
authorities, which will introduce at least 1,000 parking attendants - some
employed direct and others working for private sector subcontractors.
The attendants will have hand-held computers enabling them to check vehicle
registrations. They will then summon car clamping or removal squads to deal
with persistent offenders.
The Pounds 30 fixed penalty will rise to Pounds 60 in central London and
Pounds 40 in the rest of inner London, but will stay the same in outer
London. Motorists will be encouraged to pay promptly with the offer of a 50
per cent discount for penalties paid in 14 days and the threat of a 50 per
cent surcharge after two months.
Proceeds from the fines will be used to finance the local authorities'
enforcement activities. Any surpluses can be used to provide off-street
parking or to improve public transport or roads.

FT  30 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smoke must be getting into someone's eyes at BAT. The first part of
yesterday's statement dealt at length with the reshuffle of its European
brands; the second, which came as a fleeting postscript, with developments
on the US market since Philip Morris escalated the cigarette price war in
April. Yet that has a more significant bearing on BAT's prospects and
unfortunately the news is bad. Not only has Kool, a premium menthol brand
which was not supposed to be in Philip Morris's sights, suffered from
discounting. The process, which will lead to a Dollars 75m stock adjustment
loss in the first half, was evidently well under way before Philip Morris
struck.
The implication is that the price war will be bloodier than many at first
supposed. BAT will have to sit it out until its larger brethren decide to
call a halt. The risk is that, by then, the government will have increased
the tax on cigarettes to pay for its healthcare reforms. Margins could thus
remain under pressure for years to come.
The European exchange with American Brands will hardly compensate, despite
the striking Pounds 135m pre-tax gain for 1993. Nearly half of that
represents profit borrowed from future years. The most that can be said is
that BAT appears to have won itself a good financial deal which also makes
marketing sense, perhaps because American Brands was prepared to pay up for
control of Benson &amp; Hedges throughout the European single market. At 422p
the shares are underpinned by a yield of 5.5 per cent, but yesterday's fall
was a reminder that they remain vulnerable to bad news from the US.

FT  30 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All kinds of entertaining theories can be advanced for Granada's decision to
buy a 15 per cent chunk of LWT at a big premium to the market price. The
most dull, and least plausible, is that it is merely a passive trade
investment. A more racy plot line suggests that Granada's nose was put badly
out of joint by LWT's cheeky acquisition of a 14 per cent stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees; the bruised suitor is now seeking greater leverage to
prise its prey free. The more uncertain truth, though, may be that no one
has the faintest idea how far the government will relax the rules
surrounding multiple franchise ownership next year. The big TV companies are
simply piling up all the bargaining chips they can in advance.
Cross-shareholdings are now rapidly multiplying. A grand asset swap may yet
represent the industry's end-game.
Alongside Carlton Communications, Granada is shaping up to be one of the
dominant players in the industry. A future Granada/LWT grouping would
certainly represent a powerful force in ITV, accounting for about 23 per
cent of the network's total revenue. The shares of other ITV contractors
have shot up in anticipation of industry consolidation. Far from settling
the future shape of the ITV network, the government's franchise auctions may
only have proved a temporary staging post.

FT  30 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: United Newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to comprehend why a company with interest cover approaching six
times needs to tap shareholders for an additional Pounds 190m to fund
expansion. United's balance sheet gearing of 180 per cent partly explains
it. But that gearing level reflects the thinness of United's shareholders'
funds - at just Pounds 168m - rather than the crushing weight of borrowings.
Like other newspaper companies, United's assets are mostly intangible.
Moreover, the issue will dilute earnings this year given that the money will
initially be used to repay cheap borrowings in the UK and US. United may
have done better simply to sit back and reap the rewards of its Pounds 700m
investment programme. Given the scale of its operational gearing, profits
should certainly swing up sharply when advertising volumes recover. Every
additional Pounds 1 of revenue in United's business magazine division, for
example, translates into 65p of profit.
The 62 per cent rise in United's share price since September may have
provided the main spur for the fund-raising. Few managements can resist such
overt temptations - as the property sector has conclusively proved.
Shareholders may not begrudge United its opportunism if it really can find
suitable earnings-enhancing acquisitions.
The company's record on this front, though, is patchy. The company may also
have missed the floor for asset prices in the US, where it appears most
interested. If United really needs the money, Lord Stevens, its chairman,
should spell out precisely how he plans to spend it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 10p discount on a share flotation is not normally the kind of sum which
starts the stags rutting. But at least private investors who apply in the
BT3 offer will get the 9.5p final dividend if they hang on until mid-August.
Taken together the two incentives give private investors an effective 13 per
cent discount on the 150p first instalment. A first year yield of over 20
per cent will probably also tempt building society depositors to ignore the
capital risks. The retail offer will thus probably be a modest success.
Assuming that those private investors tend to hang on to their shares,
institutions will find themselves even more underweight in BT. Along with
the company's remarkable cash generation that ought to ensure good
institutional demand both before and after the issue. Indeed, BT seems so
well underpinned in the short term that the Treasury's paranoia over a run
on the shares is hard to understand.
The real threats to BT's cash machine come from continuing regulatory risk
and increasing competition. An agreement on pricing is due to run until
1997. And while investigations into special offers and Yellow Pages would be
a nuisance, they seem unlikely to wreak wholesale destruction.
Competitive erosion of BT's market share is the larger worry. At present it
looks glacial, but it may speed up as Mercury expands and other competitors
enter the market. The chancellor's apparent support in principle for AT&amp;T's
licence application yesterday is thus interesting. If the government is
singing the praises of competitive pressures while trying to unload Pounds
5bn-worth of BT shares, what will it do afterwards?

Market research knows no bounds. Now it is telling us which nations fall

According to Research International, Americans, Canadians, Dutch and Germans
are all 'anxious experts' - they have strong preferences for environmentally
friendly products.
'Negotiators' (British, French and Japanese) know about green issues but
don't alter their behaviour to make room for them.
'Lip-service environmentalists' (no explanation necessary) are types like
Argentines, Italians and Portuguese. Colombians and South Africans are
'passive environmentalists' still deeply into consumerism, no matter how bad
for the environment. Then there are the Brazilians, Nigerians and Indians,
or 'spectators', which means they don't give two hoots.

What next for Devenish chairman Michael Cannon after he sells his chain of
550 West Country pubs to Greenalls? He is showing a Pounds 26m profit on a
business which started with a Pounds 30,000 investment in a Bristol pub in
1976. He could be forgiven for wanting to retire to the other side of the
bar.
However, the diminutive and dapper Cannon has no intention of retiring at
54. He was one of the first to recognise that several pints of beer was not
enough to satisfy changing consumer attitudes and has been leading the
retailing revolution in Britain's pub trade.
'We became known for red lampshades and subdued lighting - but who wants to
go to a pub and feel they're under the spotlights at the Hippodrome?' Like
Marks &amp; Spencer, Cannon tries to stay a step ahead of rivals by offering
something different. 'You have to be better than the next pub, but you don't
have to be much better to succeed.' Let's hope, for Greenalls' sake, that he
doesn't desert to the opposition.

<TEXT>
Mark Boleat - busy bee chief executive of the Building Societies Association
and about to depart for an even bigger job at the Association of British
Insurers - has earned a black mark on his otherwise unblemished report card.
He may be jolly good at putting big ideas across but recent problems at one
of the outfits under his command raise the question of whether he is
over-stretching himself by taking on too many worthy outside jobs.
The question is prompted by the recent difficulties at Circle 33, one of
Britain's biggest housing associations, which provides over 8,000 homes for
low income families in the south-east. Boleat has been associated with
Circle 33 for 15 years and has been chairman since 1990. A combination of a
police investigation into allegations of a long-running fraud and concerns
about internal monitoring procedures led to the Housing Corporation, the
official regulator and lender of last resort, temporarily suspending its
funding to Circle 33 earlier this month.
This is almost as bad as the Bank of England suspending a bank's licence and
precipitated the departure of Circle 33's director, Melinda Phillips. The
funding has been restored but the episode is embarrassing for Boleat since
he was also on the board of the Housing Corporation.
He's now stepped down to devote more time to sorting out Circle 33 but has
signalled that he will resign the Circle 33 chairmanship after the annual
meeting in September.
His problems have highlighted a dilemma facing an increasing number of busy
executives who give up their time for worthy causes. Can they spare enough
hours to keep a proper eye on a complex organisation? The days when housing
associations like Circle 33, which spend around Pounds 75m a year, can be
overseen by unpaid volunteers must be numbered.

FT  30 JUN 93 / The world on his shoulders: John Gummer must choose among
urgent priorities at the environment department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer has inherited a long list of tough choices as UK environment
secretary as well as unresolved battles with other government departments.
After a month in the job, there are questions about whether he has the clout
in the cabinet to meet the challenge.
The government's announcement this week that it is holding a further public
consultation on the future of Thorp, the Pounds 2.8bn nuclear reprocessing
plant at Sellafield, has delayed a final decision on that thorny question
until autumn. Mr Gummer is responsible for the eventual decision, however,
and the awarding of a licence to the plant, as seems likely, will earn him
the opposition of environmental groups.
A year after the Rio Earth Summit, he must also find a credible way for the
UK to meet its targets on global warming, which Mr John Major, the prime
minister, has said is a national environmental priority This week found Mr
Gummer at odds with his European counterparts, whom he accused of trying to
ambush the UK over a proposed energy tax to curb emissions of so-called
greenhouse gases.
The most complex question Mr Gummer must address is whether the UK - and
other industrial countries which have signed international 'green' treaties
 -can afford the ambitious environmental policies they have designed over
the past two decades. As recession has increased awareness of the costs of
going green, the environment has slipped on the UK political agenda.
Mr Gummer built up some green credentials as agriculture minister, mainly
for his opposition to commercial whaling. But pressure groups remain wary of
his appointment, feeling he kept silent on controversial issues, such as
agricultural contamination of rivers.
They are concerned, too, that his appointment signals a downgrading of
environmental issues in the cabinet. To many environmentalists, Mr Gummer is
a lightweight against his predecessors - Mr Chris Patten, Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr Michael Howard, now home secretary.
Concern about Mr Gummer's priorities is warranted because he takes over at a
critical point in the development of the UK's environment policy, when it is
widely accused - by other governments, environmentalists and industrialists
 -of being patchy and incoherent.
It is barely five years since the UK began seriously to develop an
environment policy. The turning point was Mrs Thatcher's apparently
overnight conversion to green issues when she told a startled Royal Society
that scientists should worry more about global warming. The government's
belief that there was political capital in the environment was strengthened
the next year when the Green party grabbed 15 per cent of the vote in the
1989 European elections.
The white paper drawn up by Mr Chris Patten in 1990, This Common
Inheritance, is one of the government's most ambitious attempts to design a
policy. It declared an 'intense hope that we can pass on what we value most
about our heritage to our children'. Its guiding principles were the use of
scientific research, the need to take 'precautionary' action when scientific
evidence was equivocal, and a desire to ensure 'the polluter pays'.
UK policy is now built on the 1990 Environmental Protection Act which
coincided with the white paper, plus the 1989 Water Act, some 200 EC
directives, a handful of international pollution treaties, and last year's
Rio conventions on biodiversity and global warming. A range of issues are
covered - from air, water and land pollution, to local planning and
promotion of worldwide 'sustainable development'.
But some expectations raised by Mr Patten and sustained by Mr Heseltine have
been dashed. Mr Howard's report last autumn on the second anniversary of the
white paper reveals an uneven record. Water pollution and some industrial
emissions have improved; traffic pollution and inner-city air quality are
getting worse.
Central parts of the 1990 act have also been dropped or delayed:
A proposed register of contaminated land has been scrapped as it threatened
to cause property blight across much of the country;
Tighter rules on landfill operators - managers of rubbish dumps - have been
postponed until clashes with EC rules are ironed out.
Last year's election pledge to create an environment agency to centralise
all pollution regulation has also given way to more politically pressing
issues.
Environmentalists blame Mr Howard, a former barrister, for this
retrenchment. But DoE officials argue that whoever had inherited the job of
implementing the 1990 act would be forced to acknowledge that parts were
ill-thought out.
The better-aimed criticism of Mr Howard is that he failed to address some of
the deeper conflicts in the government's environment policy, which Mr Gummer
now confronts.
First, many industries are forthright in warning him that greener does not
always mean richer. The European Chemical Industry Council has argued that
bulk chemical manufacture is being driven outside the EC by the costs of
complying with environmental regulation. UK manufacturers complain their
costs will soar if the government backs recycling as a waste disposal method
rather than landfill. Recycling has become a moral crusade for many parts of
the environmental movement, but generally is the most expensive method of
all.
Second, Mr Gummer must grapple with the problem of how to meet Britain's Rio
commitments to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the gases implicated
in global warming. The targets, which would bring such emissions back to
1990 levels by 2000, a cut of 6 per cent on projected levels, seem certain
to put Mr Gummer at odds with current energy and transport policies.
The government claims that it has put in place measures to take it
two-thirds of the way to meeting Rio's targets. But economists, such as
Oxford Economic Research Associates, have attacked a central plank of its
stategy - the March Budget's new taxes on motor fuel and home heating. They
say these will have little effect because demand for transport and for
domestic heating is relatively insensitive to price.
Environmentalists fear that beyond 2000 the outlook is even gloomier -
transport pollution looks particularly intractable given current plans for
more roads. However, the government appears nervous about upsetting its
supporters by higher road or energy taxes.
This autumn's review of nuclear power will be a test of the real importance
accorded by the government to the Rio principles. If the review scales down
nuclear power's long-term role in energy supply in favour of gas and other
fossil fuels it will make cutting carbon emissions even harder.
Third, Mr Gummer must address the tensions in the UK's approach to
international environment policy, which reflect the country's ambivalence
about its role. His resistance this week to the imposition of an EC-wide
energy tax indicates that he shares the government's caution over Brussels'
influence. However, the UK is unlikely to want to be labelled a permanent
dissenter, despite its concern over rising EC water standards, for instance.
Symptomatic of all the considerations about cost, energy policy and
international co-ordination is the looming decision on the Thorp plant.
Mr Gummer, who holds pro-nuclear views, needs to show the government has
addressed the wider political and economic questions raised by Thorp -
including nuclear weapons proliferation - if he is to claim the UK is
developing a coherent and far-sighted environment policy.
The choices facing Mr Gummer are not easy. They reflect underlying dilemmas
over much of government policy, notably its uneasiness about its role in
Europe, and over the fragility of its political support. The result of these
conflicts is likely to be an untidy, pragmatic environment policy. Without a
resurgence in public attention to green issues during economic recovery,
however, departure from the spirit of the 1990 white paper is unlikely to
give the government much political trouble.
The government cannot hope to satisfy all demands of the environmentalists.
The danger is that, in turning away from its 1980s green evangelism, it will
fail to act on the handful of issues that deserve to be at the centre of
environmental policy. It may saddle businesses and households with
unnecessarily high charges while failing to make enough polluters pay. It
may fail to devise an energy policy, including a role for nuclear power,
that gives it a real chance of meeting global warming targets. It may
tolerate rising transport levels despite worsening inner-city air pollution.
It may also fail to take a constructive part in the complex international
debate about how to protect the environment. These are the priorities which
stare Mr Gummer in the face. They demand a clear response.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Back Nafta now or lose it
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS IN the US of the North American Free Trade Agreement are
belatedly waking up to the possibility that the accord may fail to pass
Congress. Unless they do something about it soon, the treaty may be lost.
The agreement's motley group of opponents has been allowed to dominate a
debate in which the soundbite has counted for more than cool assessment.
Americans have heard a lot of the 'sucking sound' of US jobs heading south
of the border if the agreement goes ahead but little about the jobs that are
being created by the development of Mexico as the fastest growing market for
US goods.
US exports to Mexico expanded to Dollars 44bn last year. If, as is commonly
supposed, each Dollars 1bn of US exports is worth 20,000 US jobs, the
Mexican market - growing in part because of the prospect of a free trade
agreement - has been responsible for the creation of nearly 500,000 US jobs
in the past few years.
There will, of course, be losers in the US jobs market as well as winners.
But rejecting the agreement will not save American jobs, it will simply
increase the chances of lower-skill jobs migrating to lower-wage economies
beyond Mexico, for example in Asia.
From the standpoint of the US economy, better those jobs move to Mexico than
to the hungry economies of east Asia: for every dollar Mexicans spend abroad
on foreign goods, 75 cents is spent in the US, a much higher ratio than any
Asian country.
Capital flows
Rejecting Nafta would sharply reduce capital flows into Mexico and probably
trigger a devaluation. This would disrupt Mexico's economic prospects and
reduce US exports to Mexico.
Worse, the impact of the treaty's rejection on the Mexican political system
would be regressive. While the administration of President Carlos Salinas
would probably not shoot itself in the foot by reverting to economic
populism, there would be little incentive to continue with political reform
and the US would have lost its influence in the process.
The US would be seen instead as having spurned the outstretched Mexican
hand. A nationalist backlash could follow. While the dinosaurs of the ruling
party would not be unopposed, they could emerge from the shadows, armed with
anti-gringo rhetoric, to lead the party into the August 1994 presidential
election.
The US would face once more a suspicious neighbour to the south and the
historic advances in US-Mexican relations over the past 10 years would be
damaged. Moreover, the Clinton administration would find it difficult to
forge a constructive foreign policy in Latin America. For the region's
governments, there would be no more potent symbol of US attitudes than a
rejection of Nafta.
Stumbling blocks
As many Nafta critics point out, Mexico is far from being an open democratic
society in which the rule of law is paramount. This is bound to lead to
tensions within Nafta. Yet if these critics sincerely desire an improvement
in the way Mexico is governed, then that is surely not to be achieved by
estranging Mexico from the US.
There is a further stumbling block: the supplementary accords now being
negotiated on labour and environmental standards. Because of the
implications of these understandings on US sovereignty, they are of largely
symbolic value. As such, they should not be allowed to block passage of the
treaty.
It will not be easy to persuade a Congress, with 110 new representatives and
24 new senators who above all desire re-election, to vote in favour of a
deal which, in the popular perception, will cost US jobs. Convincing them of
its advantages cannot be left to the Mexican government and a handful of US
politicians. Those US businesses and trade unions which stand to benefit
need to engage more vigorously in pressing the case for Nafta.
Mr Clinton and his cabinet have at last begun themselves to lobby publicly
for the agreement, but they should not wait until the supplementary accords
are completed before beginning the campaign in earnest. Many of President
Clinton's critics are looking for signs that he can decide on a course of
action and push it through to a conclusion. Nafta is an important test.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Second best pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BRITAIN, as in continental Europe, public finances have been
deteriorating and the population is ageing. Political reality thus dictates
that pension provision will be undertaken increasingly by the private sector
in the decades ahead. Against that background the National Association of
Pension Funds' call for a national debate on meeting the financial needs of
the elderly is all to the good. But the pensions lobbyists have slightly
spoiled their case by suggesting, before the debate has even begun, that the
answer lies in the current approach to occupational pensions. This is not
self-evident; and the NAPF's campaign may anyway have come too late.
If occupational pensions have become a Pounds 350bn-plus business in
Britain, it is because governments have provided tax relief for pension
contributions, while employers have been prepared to remunerate employees in
a tax-efficient form. The political tide has long since turned against such
pension fund paternalism. Tax reliefs for pension contributions are under
attack by the backdoor, the latest instance being the reduction in tax
credits on UK dividends. Personal pensions, meantime, have been expensively
promoted.
On the employer side it now seems questionable, with unemployment at record
levels, whether companies need to enter the financial services business to
compete in the labour market for employees. Having enjoyed pension fund
holidays when investment returns were high, employers will think twice about
taking on big commitments to new employees now that the pension fund
surpluses are eroding. The temptation to limit the company's financial
obligation by switching to defined contribution schemes, which simply pay
out what the contributors put in, together with the investment return on the
money, must be strong. It could become stronger if the Goode committee on
pension law adds to the burden on companies.
Older workers
At first sight, a switch to defined contributions might seem no bad thing.
Employees might be able to exercise some control over their deferred pay,
since the company would not be underwriting the solvency of the fund and
thus wanting control as a quid pro quo. Many of the cross-subsidies that mar
the workings of defined benefit schemes, which favour long stayers against
the mobile or the redundant, and the low paid against the high paid, would
be eliminated.
Equally important, defined contribution schemes do not incorporate an
incentive to sack older workers, in contrast with the existing system which
has probably made a significant contribution to long-term unemployment
because the cost of funding an individual's pension tends to rise towards
retirement. Also, ownership rights can readily be identified and valued.
Arbitrary level
But there are snags with defined contribution schemes, not least the
arbitrary level of the pension received. Retiring in one week rather than
another in October 1987, when global stock markets crashed, would have
dramatically affected a pensioner's living standards. Because of the need to
diversify against such volatility, fund managers are forced to adopt a
lower-risk, and thus lower-reward, investment policy. And if the defined
contribution scheme takes the form of a personal pension, costs can be
absurdly high.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the staying power of defined benefit
schemes, not least because the biggest beneficiaries tend to be the bosses,
many of whom have shamelessly manipulated pre-retirement salaries to boost
their pensions. It may be that, as with Churchill's celebrated verdict on
democracy, they are the worst form of private pension provision, apart from
all the others. But in the absence of authoritative data to establish who
loses how much from each type of system on a range of assumptions about
employee mobility and investment returns, the proponents of the status quo
will find it hard to beat off an alternative that is transparent, much less
prone to conflicts of interest and far more healthy for labour mobility and
employment. The challenge for the pensions lobby is to come up with
convincing numbers and facts. Assertions will not be enough.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing rates of asthma among British children could be one of the next
environmental issues to provoke widespread public concern, environmentalists
and government officials believe, writes Bronwen Maddox.
But, while many doctors believe that traffic pollution triggers asthma
attacks in people who are already sufferers, medical opinion is divided
about whether it can be blamed for the increase in the number of cases. The
difficulty of proving which chemicals are responsible has not helped
environmentalists to boost public awareness, some campaigners feel.
There are no national statistics of the number of asthma cases, and doctors
warn that not all sufferers are diagnosed accurately. However, the National
Asthma Campaign quotes research on small groups which suggests that about 10
per cent of schoolchildren have wheezing of some kind, and about 3 to 5 per
cent of schoolchildren are diagnosed asthmatic. Other studies suggest about
2 to 5 per cent of adults are asthmatic, it adds.
Medical research in the past three years has also pointed to annual
increases of 5 per cent between 1973 and 1986.
The puzzle of the rise in the number of asthma cases and in their severity
is that it has occurred in the past few decades, when much industrial and
domestic air pollution in Britain has been dropping because of tighter
environmental rules. The Department of Health, which acknowledges that
'asthma is an important problem', says only that the link with 'air
pollution is particularly complex and remains incompletely understood'.
However, traffic pollution has been rising, and doctors are suggesting this
may be the culprit. Professor Robert Davies of St Bartholomew's Hospital,
London, a leading specialist in respiratory medicine, said last month that
traffic fumes were under 'very great suspicion' of triggering attacks.
The chemicals thought to be implicated are nitrogen oxide and dioxide, ozone
and sulphur dioxide, and particles from diesel exhausts.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, and the National Asthma Campaign
have urged better monitoring of roadside air pollution.
The DoH is now mounting further studies. Its committee on the medical
effects of air pollutants is investigating the link between asthma and air
pollution, under the chairmanship of Professor Ross Anderson, of St George's
Hospital Medical School, and it expects to produce a report next year. The
DoH is also funding a study on the health effects of the severe air
pollution in London in December 1991, the worst episode of nitrogen dioxide
ever recorded in the UK.
In the meantime, practising doctors have few qualms in telling patients at
risk to stay away from busy London streets. Dr Stephen Durham, consultant
physician specialising in allergies at the Royal Brompton Hospital, says
'the balance of probability is in favour of pollution' as the cause 'of both
the increase in the number and worsening symptoms of asthma cases'.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Clock keeps ticking: Prospects for a deal on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, sits down for a meeting of the
British cabinet's Hong Kong committee tomorrow he could be forgiven for
feeling that his firm stand with China in negotiations on the colony's
political future has been vindicated.
Beijing said it would never again talk to the British about Hong Kong's
development if Mr Patten did not withdraw his blueprint for a fairer, more
open way of electing members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), the
colony's lawmaking body. It also said it would never talk if Mr Patten
published his legislation.
Mr Patten has not withdrawn his proposals - they remain the British
negotiating position - and he did publish his legislation. But Beijing has
returned to the negotiating table.
Tomorrow's meeting of the British cabinet's Hong Kong committee will give
ministers an opportunity to take stock of progress made in the talks in
Beijing. It will allow them to fine-tune Britain's negotiating position and
to consider in what circumstances Britain would be prepared to terminate the
talks.
More important, it will provide an opportunity for ministers to consider how
far each side is likely to compromise to secure agreement on Hong Kong's
political future.
Only six months ago China was actively undermining business confidence in
the colony by trying to unseat the governor. Now Beijing is taking a more
positive approach than when the talks began in Beijing in late April.
China has allowed several high-profile public works contracts to proceed,
and it has indicated it wants Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport to go
ahead.
It has also proceeded with plans for nine state companies to seek listings
on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Progress on such projects reflects, in part, Beijing's wish to sustain Hong
Kong's economic and business success after sovereignty reverts to China in
1997. It is also the result of increasing co-operation between China and
much of Hong Kong's business community, eager to secure good relations with
Beijing before the handover.
But if there is evidence that China is moderating its position on economic
matters, there is no sign of progress on the political issues. China appears
to be as implacably opposed to the governor's plans to extend democracy to
Hong Kong as it has been since the proposals were unveiled last October.
The talks on Hong Kong's political development were a barren exercise until
the sixth round which ended last weekend. There was no breakthrough, but the
Chinese government set down for the first time its specific objections to
the Patten package.
Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, presented Beijing's view on the
two most controversial aspects of the package. These are the governor's
proposal for an electoral college which will elect 10 members to the LegCo
in 1995, and his proposal to broaden the franchise of 30 'functional'
constituencies, which represent special interest groups, such as business,
industry and the professions.
In the words of a senior Hong Kong government official, 'horns have been
locked'.
Britain has sought to improve Mr Patten's tactical position in the talks by
asking the Chinese to agree to full democratic elections in Hong Kong by
2007.
It has also asked for Hong Kong government representation in a Chinese
committee which will be formed in 1996 to prepare for the transfer of
sovereignty.
Mr Patten is prepared to give ground, specifically on his proposal for the
creation of nine new functional constituencies, to be added to the existing
21.
Originally he envisaged carving up Hong Kong's 2.8m workforce into nine
electorates. China saw this for what it was - an attempt to get more
broadly-based representatives elected to the LegCo.
More important, the proposal has failed to win support among LegCo members.
Mr Patten knows it would probably be defeated in LegCo if it were deciding
the matter.
The governor continues to claim there are points on which he will not
compromise. These are: the need to broaden the electoral base of the
functional constituencies; full democratic election of all members of the
electoral college; and a commitment by the Chinese to define the criteria of
a 'loyalty test' LegCo members will have to pass if they want to serve after
China resumes sovereignty in 1997. The governor will want the cabinet to
endorse his stance on these issues.
He will also want to remind ministers that time for negotiation is not
infinite. Mr Patten does not tire of reminding Hong Kong and China that
measures have to be in place to ensure adequate preparation for elections in
1994 and 1995. As Mr Patten put it yesterday, just before he flew to London,
'tick tock goes the clock'.
The governor has indicated that he wants an agreement, or at least a sign
that agreement is not far off, by September. He has not called this a
deadline, for fear that China might treat it as a deadline that must be
broken.
An autumn target is important for Mr Patten since he will want something
positive to present to the LegCo at the opening of its 1993-94 session on
October 6. The governor's credibility and that of his administration would
suffer if he were able to say only that the talks were continuing.
Mr Patten's popularity remains high in Hong Kong as does support for his
proposals for political liberalisation. And nobody is yet arguing that it is
time to pull out of the talks. Yet Mr Patten will have to be seen to have
done all in his power to secure an agreement if he is to win broad public
support.
The governor is an optimist; he believes China and Britain can do a deal. In
believing this he is betting that China's interest in achieving a
trouble-free transition from British to Chinese rule in 1997 will make
Beijing more prepared to compromise than it has so far been prepared to do.

FT  30 JUN 93 / No long-term gain without pain: India's economic reformers
have baulked at radical restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When India embarked on economic reform two years ago there was much talk of
the country imitating China's rapid economic take-off. But that prospect now
appears more remote.
Political, social and economic developments have combined to persuade Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, his finance
minister, to allow the momentum of reform to slow.
Their performance will come under scrutiny this week at the annual meeting
in Paris between India and its international aid donors, led by the World
Bank. They will get credit for shrugging off almost 40 years of
socialist-inclined central planning as they have liberalised trade rules,
reduced the public deficit and introduced a market-based exchange rate. But
the Paris meeting will note that the government in Delhi has shied away from
politically difficult decisions.
The government's reluctance to close state enterprises means India has not
seen the drastic declines in output experienced in other economic
restructurings, for example those in eastern Europe. Instead, the Indian
economy grew by 1.2 per cent in the year to March 1992, the difficult first
year of reform, by about 4.5 per cent in 1992-93, and is forecast to reach 5
per cent for 1993-94.
'India has seen growth despite readjustment,' says Mr C Rangarajan, the
governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. 'We have something
to show off.'
But critics say too little real restructuring is taking place. 'India has
not been through the public and private sector shake-out which is necessary
to create a good basis for long-term growth,' comments an economist working
for an international aid agency
Ministers have had political cause to go slow this year. Last year's Rs40bn
(Pounds 836.8m) scandal in the Bombay securities market shook their
confidence. Banks and stockbrokers circumvented rules to channel money
illegally into the stock market in the scandal which was widely, though
wrongly, perceived to have resulted from liberalisation. The government was
also distracted by violence following the destruction by Hindu militants of
the Ayodhya mosque.
There is, however, a more fundamental reason reform has lost momentum: a
lack of popular support for radical change.
About 30m of the country's 880m have jobs in the so-called organised sector
 -that is, in large public and private units which cover all main areas of
the economy from the civil service to railways and steel. They, with their
families, form the majority of India's 150m-strong urban middle class. Some
in this class would benefit from opportunities created by liberalisation.
But many fear they would not, and so resist the changes. The first
demonstration after the reforms started in mid-1991 was, for example,
mounted by clerks at over-staffed state-owned banks, insisting
liberalisation should not endanger their jobs.
The main beneficiaries of reform would be the country's remaining 700m-plus
people, who are excluded from the benefits enjoyed by those in the organised
sector, such as guaranteed jobs. Under the old system, many of these poor
have benefited from food price subsidies and similar hand-outs. But they
have been disadvantaged through being restricted to high-priced, low-quality
goods produced by protected Indian industries and through limited access to
basic services such as education.
These people have expressed few strong preferences about the reforms. But
poverty and ignorance prevent most from developing a political voice.
India's policymakers often say they cannot proceed with reform as fast as
China because, as a democracy, India must consider conflicting interests.
The truth could be that India might proceed faster with economic reforms if
the interests of these poor were better voiced.
Even so, the changes India has made so far have been fundamental. After
pursuing economic self-reliance for 40 years, India is opening up to the
world by cutting import duties, reforming the exchange rate and promoting
exports and inward foreign investment. The 'licence raj', a panoply of
industrial controls, has mostly been dismantled. Despite the securities
scandal, financial deregulation has gone ahead, including liberalisation of
foreign institutional investment.
Businessmen have responded by proposing an unprecedented number of new
projects, many involving foreign technology. These include power stations,
electronics plants and textile mills. Foreign companies have, since
mid-1991, pledged to invest more than USDollars 2bn. Mr B K Modi, head of
the Modi group, an industrial combine, says: 'Indian industry is already
getting ready for international competition.'
But the willingness to plan has not - so far - always been matched by actual
investment. Foreign investors have committed only about 20 per cent of the
funds promised. Mr S K Khanna, senior partner in India of Arthur Andersen,
the accountancy firm, says: 'We don't see a great rush to invest.'
This caution has held back growth. A rise in exports, without which India
cannot earn the foreign exchange to fund its investment needs, was just 3.6
per cent in the year to March, against a target of over 15 per cent.
Industrial production grew in the same period by only 3.8 per cent, with 6
to 7 per cent forecast for this year. These growth rates accord with India's
past experience but fall well short of those achieved in the high-growth
economies of east Asia, whose example India seeks to follow.
Large-scale investments take time to come to fruition. But a more basic
reason for sluggish growth is that many Indian factories still produce goods
uncompetitive by world standards. A sharp increase in output, particularly
exports, can come only if these plants are rigorously restructured.
Reform-minded sceptics also need convincing that bureaucratic fingers really
are being lifted from the economy. While many controls have gone, officials'
desire to exercise economic power has not. For example, the
telecommunications ministry has been deliberating for almost a year on the
award of licences for India's first cellular telephone network.
Reform of India's labour laws is no less important to promoting growth.
These laws, which place tight restrictions on employers' rights to dismiss
workers, are among the most important obstacles to reform state-owned
enterprises. The government wants to privatise sound enterprises and to
restructure the rest, using the proceeds of privatisation. But investors
show little appetite for shares in the state companies, which account for
about two-thirds of workers in large-scale employment, because of the
government's unwillingness to press ahead with job cuts. Ministers retreated
from reform of labour legislation late last year.
Another critical issue is further financial reform - especially the
restructuring of nationalised banks. For too long, these banks have
channelled low-cost funds to state-owned enterprises and other politically
approved borrowers, such as farmers, who were often under no pressure to
repay. The government is injecting funds to help the banks write off Rs100bn
(Pounds 2.14bn) in bad debts. It is also slowly liberalising lending rules
to make banks more commercially minded - but much more slowly than critics
want.
Carrying out the necessary measures would bring pain to many but would also
release resources to tackle India's other deep-seated economic weaknesses:
shortages of electricity and transport as well as inadequate education and
population control programmes. Besides helping the poor, such investments
would eventually assist economic growth.
This week's meeting in Paris will set the tone for decisions by donors over
the next year on aid totalling about Dollars 7bn. Donors are unlikely to
withhold money, but they would give with better grace if the pace of reform
was faster. Indian officials will argue very hard that they have done more
than enough to promote reform. By the standards of their own country's past,
they have indeed moved with surprising speed. But by the standards required
to satisfy India's aspirations, the pace is much more sedate.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: Service contract rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL D VARCOE-COCKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Corporate lawyer Ronnie Fox writes that the starting point for
calculating a payment for termination of employment of an executive is (my
emphasis) the amount that the executive would have earned during the
unexpired notice period (Letters, June 28).
Although I agree broadly with the rest of the letter, as a fellow corporate
lawyer, I believe the starting point should be what the executive would have
been entitled by contract under his service agreement (including any
provisions for mitigation), although earnings for the unexpired notice
period may form an important element in the final amount. Mr Fox is right to
point out the unfairness of mitigation in the case of a senior executive in
his 50s, but where such an executive is able to move quickly to a new job on
comparable terms, there is no reason why his compensation should be not be
mitigated if that is what the service agreement provides.
The agreement is what the parties negotiated at the outset and, where senior
executives are concerned, they will have had a reasonable say in the terms.
The agreement should foresee a broad range of possibilities and provide a
reference point for both employee and employer to assess the likely result
of early termination.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: UK productivity growth and the trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY BARKER and Mr RICHARD LEWNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan is right to emphasise the substantial changes in the
structure of UK trade and the increased importance of services ('That
manufacturing fallacy again', June 28). Our long-term projections, based on
a detailed analysis of trade performance by manufacturing and service
industries, forecast a sustained reduction in the huge deficit on the
balance of payments as the European recovery gets under way and the effects
of the sterling devaluation come through, even with a recovery in UK
domestic demand.
However, these forecasts are predicated on continued improvements in
competitiveness, and in particular strong productivity growth in both
manufacturing and traded services. The issue for policy is whether
government has a useful role to play in sustaining these improvements, for
example through re-entry to the exchange rate mechanism at a competitive
rate, raising standards of education and training, or measures to stimulate
innovation. The technical question of whether the market will restore a
sustainable current account position misses the point. There will, of
course, exist various combinations of the terms of trade and domestic demand
consistent with external balance. A competitive economy will enjoy higher
terms of trade and no external constraint on domestic demand growth.
On interpreting the recent data showing strong import growth, we doubt that
there is any significant lag between domestic spending and imports, and
believe that the answer lies rather in sterling's overvaluation and the
composition of domestic spending (eg investment demand for goods in which
the UK is not specialised). The higher share of manufactures (as opposed to
raw materials) in imports means that imports are more responsive to relative
price changes than ever, and we expect a relatively strong response to
sterling's decline. Incidentally, we also expect the large increases in
import prices to begin to be reflected in retail prices shortly.

<TEXT>
Sir, The new chancellor, in his FT interview ('A rounded bloke at the
Treasury', June 25), declared his to be 'essentially a political post', but
did not feel disqualified from handling monetary policy, which is
essentially technical - like the administration of justice - and must be
non-political to achieve the best results.
Small wonder, in the debate over an independent Bank of England left to
conduct monetary policy free from political interference, Clarke
acknowledged himself to be 'sitting on the fence' - an uncomfortable
position, nevertheless, if maintained for any length of time.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: British Gas - monopoly and costs at issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E R STEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex comments ('British Gas', June 22) that 'figures (on rate of return)
around 4.5 per cent for existing assets and 7 to 8 per cent for new
investment look sensible'. No wonder that the issue which excites British
Gas most is its desire to retain the pipelines. This seems to rank in
importance above everything else, even the domestic market.
Maybe Lex has been able to unravel British Gas's cost base to conclude this.
Without full inspection of British Gas's costs and its apportionment to
different aspects of the business - as well as answers to many of the other
strategic issues which are central to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry - to sympathise with British Gas and its rate of return arguments
would be to fall into a ready trap. The result would be potentially damaging
effects on the developing competitive structure of the industry and to the
detriment of the price of gas paid by end-consumers.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: British Gas - monopoly and costs at issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C H BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Abolishing the gas monopoly' (June 29), raises some
very important issues relating to the public interest. Although the theory
of your argument is plausible, a number of the practicalities have not been
properly addressed.
First, a competitive framework would, as the article rightly concludes, lead
to the phasing-out of subsidies to about 12m households with lower levels of
consumption. But can it really be in the wider public interest for these
people, mostly less well-off, to face increases in their gas bills of up to
94 per cent? Who else would pay? The shareholder or the government
(taxpayer)? The present system works efficiently with high levels of
customer satisfaction on value for money and quality of service. Prices have
come down by 20 to 25 per cent since privatisation, in contrast with the
electricity industry where competition has yet to develop and prices have
gone up - hardly an appropriate comparison.
Our company is neither afraid of competition nor protected from it. On the
contrary competitors are now operating in 53 per cent of the firm industrial
market, and 13 per cent of the tariff market above 2,500 therms. We have
published proposals that will also ensure competition in the interruptible
market. There are two further practical hurdles. Accurate metering is
essential for developing a competitive market, for without adequate daily
measurement and the means of using that information, there would be
significant extra costs leading to massive consumer discontent.
Huge strides have already been made in producing a technically advanced
ultrasonic meter. Field tests are already taking place, but full development
is some years away. Again who will pay? But the most critical issue you have
overlooked is the safety of gas supply. What distinguishes gas from
electricity is that when it fails it is dangerous. That is the main reason
why no other country has competition in gas supply to domestic households.
This is the single issue on which there must be no compromise.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Arts: David Bedford's 'Touristen Dachau' - Spitalfields
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it makes much of its setting among the remains of a Georgian area
of London, the Spitalfields Festival supports 20th-century music as well as
period. There is something ironic about going to hear the newest of new
music in Hawksmoor's Christ Church, which looks more elderly and in more
desperate need of repair every year.
The main new work this time was David Bedford's Touristen Dachau, a festival
commission. It is described as a chamber opera, but solo cantata might come
closer. One singer and a group of chanting schoolboys (hidden behind pillars
here, not really audible) are the only performers, supported by a small
instrumental group of three strings, three wind and percussion. There is no
acting as such, no plot; if there is any drama, it is in the mind.
The central character is a tourist at the concentration camp at Dachau -
presumably a woman, as the part was taken by Jane Manning, accompanied by
her group, Jane's Minstrels. In the text, however, the sex becomes
interchangeable. The tourist assumes the identities of various people
associated with the place, past and present, a student, a Jewish prisoner, a
nun (a Catholic convent was built at the Dachau site) and so on.
Bedford's aim is less to characterise them than to create the general
atmosphere. By choosing a present-day tourist as its mouthpiece, Michael
White's text invites its quota of naive observations, which may be fair
enough, but the final scene (woman contemplates God himself as a tourist to
sanctimonious hymn-like accompaniment) is surely too mawkish. One comes away
missing the pain, the ethical grit, the strident sounds, with which
composers usually load this subject to excess.
The Bedford work lasted barely half an hour, so there was room for more on
the programme. Unfortunately the infirmity of the soprano's voice in its
present state sank the other vocal works without trace. In different
circumstances Arne Nordheim's Tre voci might prove a potent short cycle of
Italian settings. Of the instrumental pieces, Thea Musgrave's Impromptu No.
2 for wind trio was welcome for its bubbling energy and glistening textures.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Arts: Good sports come dressed to kill - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moving News At 10 means the end of serious commercial television, according
to Sir David Nicholas, who was for many years the inspirational chief
executive at ITN. But the truth is surely the other way about: the ending of
serious commercial television in Britain is leading inevitably to the moving
of News At 10. Argument continues about where to put ITV's main bulletin
within peak time (between 6.00 and 10.30) but commercial forces demand that
the ten o'clock slot be cleared so that 'adult' drama and movies can be
screened uninterrupted - except by commercials, of course - after the nine
o'clock watershed, and commercial considerations are now paramount in ITV.
That, among other things, is what the British people have consistently voted
for over the last 15 years. As promised, successive Conservative
administrations have pursued a market philosophy, forcing commercial
competition into everything from health to transport. Broadcasting was a
particular target. Now, having destroyed the benign, albeit fortuitously
conceived, duopoly system which provided such an extraordinary flow of high
quality programmes from the BBC and ITV, the government, with its new rules
for broadcasting, has ensured that News At 10 will cease to be. The only
alternative is to reverse the entire thrust of recent broadcasting
legislation, replace 'light touch control' with a statist rod of iron, and
force ITV to stick with a ten o'clock news. Having sown the wind we are
reaping the whirlwind. It was all quite foreseeable and predicted here:
public service broadcasting in the commercial sector is going down the
tubes, Gresham's law is operating, bad is driving out good, and tabloid
telly is taking over.
Watching this week's tennis, athletics and boxing makes you wonder what
television's ideal sports personalities will be like in the year 2003.
Television has already made them peculiarly boastful and startlingly sexy:
how much further down that road can matters proceed? That television is now
the chief driving force behind virtually every development in sport seems
unmistakable, and, just as members of the Flying Squad began to imitate the
characters they saw on screen in The Sweeney, so sportsmen and women today
clearly seem to take the pictures they see on television as the pattern upon
which to model themselves.
In the old days you would have known how Stanley Matthews looked if he
happened to play for your local team, and anybody anywhere might have known
his face from a cigarette card. But to most of the world the details of his
body below the shoulders would have been a mystery. Today we are all
intimately familiar not only with John Regis's pectoral development, but
with the precise delineation of his primary sexual characteristics: you can
hardly miss them as he comes hurtling into the camera covered only in a
thin, tight layer of Lycra. Among women athletes matters have gone even
further. Some at the Rome meeting extensively covered over the weekend by
the BBC favoured a brief top and skin tight pants, leaving the navel bare,
like the presenters on the satellite rock video channel, MTV. Others opted
for one-piece Lycra outfits, much like the modern bathing suit, cut high on
the thigh, low on the bust, and explicitly close in the crotch. The
assertion that this sort of tight-fitting outfit is more comfortable than a
conventional pair of shorts and a loose vest would carry more conviction if
lipstick, nail varnish and ear rings were less in evidence; and if hair
stylists are not actually attending in dressing rooms these days, they must
be lurking close by. The reasons are hardly difficult to guess: people such
as the German long jumper Heike Drechsler are now paid huge sums in
endorsement fees, and advertisers prefer their heroes and heroines to look
sexy and photogenic. Heike sprinting into the lens with baggy shorts
flapping will sell fewer carbonated drinks, presumably, than Heike flaunting
her all like something out of Penthouse. And once the Heike Drechslers have
set the trend other athletes, even if lacking endorsement contracts, copy
the look, Sweeney like.
As for boastfulness, it can reach embarrassing levels, perhaps because
sportsmen, encouraged to be self-confident, now use in the first person
singular the sort of descriptive passages they have heard from television
commentators and coaches who speak, of course, in the third person.
Interviewed on BBC2 on Sunday after his magnificent win in the 5000 metres
at Rome, Rob Denmark said inter alia: 'I was really pleased with the way I
ran it, I was cool, I was composed . . . I kept thinking 'You're better than
all the others' . . . I just ran the perfect race . . . I was very pleased
with the way I ran it . . . I ran a very brave race and it's an
understatement to say I'm absolutely delighted . . . I think it shows my
maturity that I'm confident enough to do that.'
The days of the strong, silent, sporting hero are apparently over. With
television calling the shots and creating the personalities which are wanted
by the marketing chaps, the sports stars of the future will have to
complement their weight training with media management courses to handle all
the stadium interviews and personal grooming lessons to prepare them for the
cameras. This is not exaggeration. The interview beside track, court or ring
is now an integral part of the television presentation; television
interviews are written into Wimbledon contracts. When Loyd Honeyghan fought
Vinnie Pazienza on ITV on Sunday the former wore some sort of black
loincloth and the latter matching shorts and boots covered in umpteen layers
of shimmering gold.
Given this transformation of sport into an arm of television marketing, it
seems a pity that television continues to be so poor at righting the balance
a bit by organising series which keep a journalistic eye on the subject. The
latest, ITV's Sport In Question, turns out to be a sequence of saloon bar
arguments in which, as ever, the panel of 'experts' and 'celebrities' are
given the lion's share of the time, and the members of the studio audience,
as ever, hardly get a look in. The development of sport, marketing and
television into a single seamless entity appears at present to be
irresistible.
Any defender of freedom of expression would want to champion the BBC's right
to dramatise DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley which ended on Sunday, but how
embarrassing if we have to defend Ken Russell's production. A mixture of
playfulness and banality, it offered neither a faithful version of the
printed original nor an outrageous Russell romp. The real Russell is a
big-screen image maker, and there were occasional reminders of this: however
much of a visual cliche, the shot of Connie in pure white searching a
glistening black coal tip for her lover was momentarily breathtaking, and
the carefully reversed shots showing her return to Wragby Hall, first from
below the steps, then from inside the porch, made a pleasant change in a
medium which cares so little about mise en scene.
But too often it made you cringe. Russell will insist on acting in his own
works these days, and then turning in weirdly ham performances, this time
playing Connie's father as a cross between John Bull and Father Christmas.
His willingness to exchange Lawrence's heart searching for schlock fiction
emerged most clearly in the absurd happy ending where Mellors, gazing sadly
into the steamer's wake as he leaves for a new life in Canada, hears the
tannoy announcing 'Lady Jane is waiting for Sir John Thomas on the upper
deck, please come' (nudge nudge) 'immediately'. The odd thing is that
Russell's past work suggests he believes as much as Lawrence did in the
redemptive power of sexual passion, yet you would never guess it from this
work.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Arts: The Very Big Carla Bley Band - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Without leaders like Carla Bley, the big band format would be in danger of
becoming a part of the musical heritage industry. Turned on to jazz as a
girl by the showmanship and antics of Lionel Hampton and his orchestra, her
development through bebop into abstract and long narrative works has
produced a writer who breathes new life into the large ensemble.
The mixed colours of Afro-American jazz with shades of the exotic in her
scores have reflections of Charles Mingus. But less gothic than the late
bass player's dark and dangerous arrangements, Bley's big-hearted work is
home to more approachable demons.
Like the best of all big band music, The Very Big Band's large mass of bass
bears down on the listener with irresistible force. At the Royal Festival
Hall on Monday with charts ranging from the newest 'On The Stage In Cages'
to the oldest 'All Fall Down', the 13-strong brass section featured soloists
Lew Soloff on trumpet and British tenor saxophonist Andy Sheppard. Delicious
mood swings from movement to movement allowed soloists to break easily from
the ranks, roaring New Orleans style or squiggling atonally: the crazy
sleaze of Gary Valente's hellfire trombone pitted against the slippery notes
of Wolfgang Puschnig's alto. Placing a few chords at the piano and looking
like the rogue replicant from Blade Runner in her electrified mop-top, the
willowy 55 year old leader directed elegantly.
'Strange Arrangement' was a choice piece of squeaky and off kilter Bley,
while 'Who Will Rescue Your?' opened with melodious melodrama finally
crossing over into rocky rhythms projected into the middle of next week by
Valente's supersonic trombone (why is this person not seen more outside the
Bley bands?). After the interval, the second set began with a wilful
experiment in glumness by the addition of violinist Alex Balenescu, relieved
by slick and speedy changes from Sheppard and Soloff and a clashing of brass
which Balenescu's sawing finally made sense of. 'Permanent Wave' was
described by Bley as slow and soft and she hoped it would stay that way. It
didn't, and once Valente had a hold of it, the rest of the band rose
grandiosely with him.
Finally and gloriously, Bley gave in to the trombones' bristling slides
completely and with Charles Mingus's 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' consolidated her
role as natural successor to the demon big band leader.

<TEXT>
The Bergen International Festival always ends with the Grieg piano concerto.
Listening to it in the fiery performance of the brilliant young Leif Ove
Andsnes with the Bergen Philharmonic, on the 150th anniversary of the
composer's birth, one realised that this work, more than any other, gave
Norway its musical voice.
To say that Norway is proud of this son is an understatement. Since the
beginning of the year the country has been turned upside down. There have
been drop-in concerts, jazz sessions, folk-song recitals, all connected in
some way with the composer. The Lofoten Islands have celebrated his visit.
In one town there was even a Grieg marathon.
As the composer's native city, Bergen is at the centre of all this. He was
born there on June 15 1843, and he died there. This year's festival moved
from its normal date in May to coincide with the anniversary. King Harald
and Queen Sonja attended the memorial concert, at which a specially
commissioned work, Hommage a Grieg by Alfred Schnittke, was performed: it
turned out to be a charming, wistful piece saved from pastiche by subtle
dissonances and a soaring violin solo.
The man who gave rise to all this comes across strongly from an exhibition
called 'Your Grieg' at the local Museum of Applied Art in the very building
where the composer's body lay in 1907. He was mercurial, humorous, often
outspoken, always totally honest. Extracts from his 20,000 lively letters
(strange how many composers could also handle the pen) provide the sole
commentary for an excellent video.
One is struck by how tiny he was: but in spite of constant ill health which
sent him round the spas of Europe, he was a mighty atom. He was fearless in
expressing his views, political or other, refusing for instance to give
concerts in France after Dreyfus was sentenced in 1899.
He seems not to have been very interested in his Scottish ancestry: all
Norwegian Griegs are descended from Alexander Greig - the composer's
great-grandfather, who moved to Bergen in 1770 from a small town north of
Aberdeen and set up a successful business exporting dried fish and lobster
to Britain. His only other real connexion with things British was his
friendship with the young Percy Grainger who, he declared, understood him
better than anyone else.
In Bergen today you will look in vain for the house he was born in: it was
burned down in 1945. The centre of the Grieg cult there is the lakeside home
he built himself six miles south of the city at Troldhaugen - Trolls' Hill -
together with the wooden hut in the garden in which he did his composing.
The house is a Grieg museum, and recitals are given both in it and in a hall
built in a little ravine beside it.
The city - a charming place set among mountains, fjords and pine-clad
islands - is well provided with venues for music. The big Grieg Hall is an
ugly piece of concrete but has a fine acoustic, as does the smaller
Haakonshalle, built by an early Norwegian king in the 13th century.
There is also the National Theatre, which dates from the turn of the century
and is much devoted to Ibsen. This year it presented a new production of
Peer Gynt with the Grieg incidental music, contrasting with the brilliant
Ingmar Bergman production of the same play in which Grieg features not at
all. Another new work is the ballet on the composer's life, Grieg A Jour,
with choreography by Solvi Edvardsen and music by Frank T. Nordensen.
You come away from all these events with a corrected impression of an
otherwise hackneyed composer. Grieg's music is much more than those 'bonbons
stuffed with snow' of the Debussy gibe. The small cubicles at the exhibition
where they play samples from his compositions bear that out; in the best of
the songs and chamber music, in folk song arrangements that look forward to
Bartok, a much stronger musical personality is revealed.

Alzheimer's is a particularly loathsome disease because it turns sufferers
into different people. We are, to a large extent, our memories whether in
the complex sense of carrying our family history with us or at the simplest
level of remembering how to make a cup of tea. Alzheimer's destroys both
capacities and turns mothers and fathers, husbands and wives into fey
strangers. Some victims shout and wander around, others, like my late
father, sit and smile quietly, not knowing who you are or what you are
doing. Black Daisies For The Bride is BBC2's 'ScreenPlay' production written
as a prelude to National Alzheimer's Awareness Week by poet Tony Harrison.
Filmed in High Royds Hospital in Yorkshire, it combines documentary, drama,
music and verse (9.00). The Late Show follows up with a studio discussion
(11.15).
It is bad enough that BBC2 and Channel 4 run their wildlife repeats against
one another, worse that they ensure the subjects clash. Last week both
covered beetles, this week it is snakes. C4 offers Rattler and BBC2 adders
in Summer Wildlife (8.30).

FT  30 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Utilities' chance to clean up
 -Laurie Morse describes a US plan that allows companies to turn cuts in
sulphur dioxide emissions into dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protecting the environment with legislation is notoriously difficult. Even
when the measures to be taken find general agreement, government regulations
often result in high costs - either to industry or to taxpayers.
But the group of environmental radicals who crafted the US 1990 Clean Air
Act may have turned this situation around. Having achieved a political
mandate to clean up the air, they set up a rare market solution for
achieving the goal. To date, the programme, which encourages trading in
pollution allowances, is getting rave reviews from environmentalists,
electric utility customers and from the industry it is assigned to modify.
The Clean Air Act requires that by 2000, US sulphur dioxide emissions be
reduced to half their 1980 level of 19m tons. This should remove the acid
rain that is killing many north-eastern watersheds.
Rather than force the nation's electric utilities - the largest sulphur
dioxide polluters - to adopt uniform technology for pollution abatement, the
Environmental Protection Agency defined emissions standards, issued permits
for the allowable level of pollution, and then told the utilities to design
their own emissions clean-up programmes. If they reduce emissions more than
required, they can sell their surplus pollution permits.
'This turns the regulatory system on its head,' says Daniel Dudek, senior
economist for the Environmental Defence Fund, a Washington-based advocacy
group. 'Rather than providing a ceiling for compliance, the regulations
provide a floor. It motivates companies to clean up beyond legal
requirements and turn that into dollars. It also inspires innovation in
technology and clean-up strategies.'
The programme gives utilities unusual flexibility in meeting emissions
requirements, and allows them to seek the lowest-cost compliance
alternative.
The market-based compliance process is welcomed by the US electric power
industry, which faces financial pressures from deregulation. Federal energy
rulings are gradually curbing the utilities' monopoly control over their
transmission lines, opening the door to cut-rate producers and allowing big
customers to haggle over the prices they pay for power. In many cases,
electric companies are finding it difficult to recover capital construction
expenditures, including those for pollution control equipment, by raising
utility rates.
The allowance programme is being implemented in two stages. In the first
phase, 110 of the nation's dirtiest power plants, most of them in the
mid-west, have until 1995 to cut their sulphur dioxide output by 25 per
cent; by 2000 they must reduce emissions by a further 25 per cent.
They will then be joined by hundreds more utilities in phase two of the
clean-up, which extends to 2010. By then, US sulphur dioxide emissions will
have dropped to 8.95m tons (8.12m metric tonnes). From 2010 onward, there
will be only 8.95m tons of pollution allowances available. The EPA will
strictly enforce the emissions levels, levying fines of Dollars 2,000
(Pounds 1,333) for each stray ton of sulphur dioxide output.
Most of the utilities, which usually burn low-cost regional coal to fuel
their generators, will comply by installing expensive smokestack
'scrubbers', or switch to low-sulphur fuels. However, some, like Carolina
Power and Light, will buy additional pollution allowances as the lowest-cost
compliance alternative.
CP and L uses clean-burning low-sulphur coal and already meets the 1995
emissions standards. To meet the more stringent standards for 2000, it would
have had to install millions of dollars in air-cleaning equipment for only
marginal improvement in air quality. Instead, it has purchased 85,103
pollution permits, each allowing one ton of sulphur dioxide emissions for
one year in the second phase of the programme. It paid Dollars 11.5m, or
about Dollars 135 each, at an EPA allowance auction held in Chicago in
March. The utility expects to buy additional allowances directly from other
utilities.
James Davis, CP and L's senior vice-president for fossil generation,
estimates the price at about one-third the cost of installing and operating
scrubbers. 'Purchasing these and other allowances will enable us to delay
the need to install scrubbers until 2005 at the earliest,' he says. 'This
translates into direct cost savings for our customers, since they ultimately
pay for environmental regulation.'
For a relatively clean plant like Davis's, scrubber installation and
maintenance costs can be as high as Dollars 800 per ton of emission
reduction.
Overall, the EPA estimates electric utility customers would have had to pay
30-60 per cent more for the benefits of the Clean Air Act if it were not for
the allowance programme. 'There will be an increase in electric rates, but
it will be far lower than under the old command-and-control system,' says
Renee Rico, an EPA administrator of the acid rain programme (which is
implementing the Clean Air Act). She points out that under the allowance
scheme the biggest polluters will make the biggest emissions reductions.
American Electric Power, the US's largest coal-burning utility, has 50 power
plants distributed across seven mid-western states. Twenty-one of its sites
must meet the 1995 compliance deadlines. Henry Fayne, AEP's controller, says
the allowance programme enables his company to over-comply by building a
scrubber on one site, and distributing the resulting surplus permits to
other plants in the system. 'If we over-comply in one place, we don't have
to comply in others,' he says.
AEP is building a Dollars 815m scrubber at its Gavin plant in Gallipolis,
Ohio. When it begins operation in 1995, it will cut Gavin's sulphur dioxide
output to 30,000 tons a year from the current 388,000 tons. That reduction,
and fuel switching at other sites, will bring all 50 of AEP's power plants
into compliance.
Pollution permits, like scrubbers, allow utilities to continue to burn local
high-sulphur coal. The Clean Air Act has significantly reduced demand for
that coal, depressing prices and putting thousands of mid-western miners out
of work.
For some utilities, coal mines, and miners, are important customers.
Illinois Power, a utility in southern Illinois, used the clean air standards
to negotiate lower coal prices in contracts with its suppliers, Arch
Minerals and Peabody Coal. With the contract concessions and a portfolio of
pollution permits, it will continue to burn about 5m tons of local coal a
year, preserving mining jobs and satisfying the sulphur dioxide emissions
requirements.
Illinois Power will purchase between 75,000 and 125,000 pollution allowances
a year until 1999. After that, it will install scrubbers. Delaying the
technology decision will allow new research on scrubbers to be completed,
Illinois Power chief executive officer Larry Haab said, in a statement
announcing the agreements.
Environmental groups have accepted permits as a low-cost and direct means of
reducing pollution. By removing each allowance they buy from the market,
they reduce national sulphur dioxide output by one ton for a year. In a
notable gesture, North East Utilities, a Hartford, Connecticut-based power
company, donated 10,000 allowances to the American Lung Association in
support of cleaner air.
One aspect of the allowance programme that is still lagging is a low-cost
means for utilities to trade the permits. The EPA is developing a
computerised system to track allowances and record ownership changes. But
that system is behind schedule, and until it is operational the Chicago
Board of Trade will delay holding a second allowance auction, originally
scheduled for this month.
Utilities continue to arrange private contracts for permit swaps, with most
focusing on allowances for the second phase of the programme.
'All this planning takes tremendous lead time,' says Andrew Weissman, a
principal in Clear Air Capital Markets, which specialises in allowance
trades. 'Most companies have finished their phase one planning, and are just
starting on phase two.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Management: A boost for word power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A technique used by many of the world's largest companies to help executives
write simple, informative reports and memos is now available in the UK.
'Information mapping' is based on research carried out at Harvard and
Columbia Universities. It uses principles of information analysis and
management which are instinctive to naturally fluent writers, but which can
be learned.
Examples are:
The use of 'bullet points', or short, clear statements taken from the main
text, to ram home the essential elements of an argument.
Ways of splitting dense text into fact-rich chunks which can be easily
assimilated.
Obvious enough, perhaps, but anyone who has struggled to comprehend a
detailed technical report will understand the importance of helping the
message pass efficiently from writer to reader.
Information mapping's arrival in the UK is the result of an agreement
between the Danish company Information Mapping Europe (IME) and TMS Computer
Authors, a small Godalming, Surrey-based organisation specialising in
documentation and training. With a capital injection of Pounds 450,000 from
the 3i group, last year it turned over Pounds 3.5m.
Jean Hilder, a director of Computer Authors, points out that managers read
on average 1m words a week and forget 80 per cent of what they have learned
within a month.
Companies that have used information mapping report significant benefits: a
38 per increase in the use of documentation by its recipients, 30 per cent
decrease in reading time and 55 per cent fewer errors. Among IME's clients
are AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment, Dow Chemical, IBM and Sun Life of Canada.
Computer Authors is planning public seminars on information mapping at
Pounds 750 plus VAT per person or seminars for up to 15 people at Pounds
5,000 plus VAT.

FT  30 JUN 93 / People: Edelman fills gap at Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Edelman (right) is a devotee of bananas and is all in favour of
informality. Unlike his predecessor, however, he intends neither to eat the
fruit in meetings nor wear cycling shorts to the office.
The managing director of Carlton Communications, who has been headhunted to
replace David Dworkin as chief executive of Storehouse, is 'a very normal,
straightforward, calm and collected individual with his feet planted firmly
on the ground', according to chairman Ian Hay Davison.
Dworkin, who had succeeded in turning around BHS and took over as chief
executive of the group last May, resigned abruptly in February to run US
department store Cater Hawley Hale. His departure greatly angered
Storehouse.
With bonuses for his BHS performance, he collected a total of Pounds 3.3m in
his last year. Edelman's pay, by contrast, will be 'in accordance with
English market norms; we will not be making headlines on that front',
according to Hay Davison. He will be on 24 months' notice, 12 on his side.
The company employed headhunters to search both sides of the Atlantic,
quickly discovering that it was not looking directly in the women's wear
retailing sector because 'too few candidates had in-depth management skills'
in Hay Davison's view.
Meanwhile Edelman is keen to stress his departure is quite unconnected with
any friction at Carlton or any falling out with chairman Michael Green.
'Michael and I get on very well; I am afraid there is no story there.'
However, he had been managing director for just two years.
Edelman, who is only 42, says he enjoys retailing more than anything else he
has done because of the pace - referring to his spell as chairman of Texas
Homecare which had just been acquired by Ladbroke when he took charge.
Describing himself as 'financially oriented' but not an accountant, previous
jobs included a spell as financial controller of the UK, Irish and Nordic
businesses of Bank of America. He then went to Grand Met, where he was
finance director of Express Dairies before moving to Ladbroke.
While the onerous task of righting BHS, of which Edelman will also be chief
executive, is largely complete and the turnaround at Mothercare, where Ann
Iverson is in charge, is in train, the new boss, who arrives in August, will
not be short of things to do. 'The management is thin, tightly stretched and
badly in need of pulling together,' says the chairman, referring to the gap
at the top left by Dworkin's hasty exit.
And as to the inevitable question as to whether he is related to Asher
Edelman, the US arbitrageur who stalked Storehouse during 1989, he replies:
'Not that I know of but I have always wanted to meet him.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / People: Pilkington posting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington, the glass products group whose fortunes have fluctuated in North
America, is sending main board member Peter Grunwell (right) to Toledo,
Ohio, where he will take charge of both American continents, with the
purpose of 'putting him closer to his markets', according to a spokesman
yesterday. It is the first time Pilkington has based a plc director overseas
full-time.
The company denies the move is directly connected with its problems at
Toledo-based Libbey-Owens-Ford (Lof) where chief executive Ronald Skeddle
and two other directors were fired last month after allegedly giving
data-processing contracts to a company they controlled jointly with an Ohio
University business professor. 'The timing is a coincidence. Grunwell's move
is part of a reorganisation of responsibilities of existing board members
which we have been considering for some time.'
Grunwell, 56, has been at Pilkington since 1961. He worked his way up on the
finance side, rising to the position of finance director. In 1990 he then
moved to covering South America, New Zealand, Australia and the Far East.
The latter three geographical regions will now come under Glen Nightingale.
Since the departure of Skeddle, who was not on Pilkington's main board, Lof
chairman Trevor Jones had been running the operation, but the company is now
searching for a chief executive officer. Jones will report to Grunwell.
As a big supplier to General Motors and others, the North American
operation, which represents 31 per cent of group turnover, is highly
dependent on the automotive industry. However it claims to have seen better
results in the first three months of this year.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Jobs: The company that rose from the pit - Real-life
survivor tells how organisations' political problems can be tackled and
tamed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN the vogue for performance reviews nowadays, even readers who don't
regularly carry out appraisals will be used to having same thrust upon them.
But how many of you, I wonder, have had a managerial colleague spontaneously
approach you and say: 'I'm most interested in hearing from you about things
which you think I could improve my performance by changing. Also, any things
that you believe are important, yet you believe that I do not see.'
The Jobs column's guess is that it hasn't happened to very many of you,
although no doubt the odd case occurs. Even when it has done, however, I'd
take bets that the colleague wasn't the chief executive of your company.
The sole recorded instance I know of is in the outfit I wrote about four
weeks ago. As enduring readers may remember, it was set up by seven
high-fliers who'd decided they could no longer bear the organisational
politics in the separate management consultancies where they had worked
before. Their avowed aim in establishing their own consultancy was that its
internal dealings would be open and straightforward.
Alas, it nevertheless soon turned into a political snake-pit at least as bad
as any they had left. The worst of the slithery manoeuvring, moreover, was
being perpetrated by the seven founder-directors themselves. Fortunately,
unlike the numerous top managements that turn a blind eye to such
counter-productive problems, they elected to tackle them and called in
Harvard University professor Chris Argyris to help to set matters to rights.
In his book* on the remedial project, the professor tells how the one of the
seven who'd been made chief executive decided that, as he appraised the work
of his six fellow-founders, they should be given a chance to appraise his.
He therefore called them all to a board meeting, and began with the words I
quoted early on.
My own impression that such events are unusual is confirmed by Chris
Argyris, who says: 'Rarely does a chief executive officer bring his or her
group together in order to review the CEO's performance. A few CEOs might
hold a private review with a close colleague. Few would consider doing it
with their entire group, and even fewer would actually implement it.'
That set me wishing - along with well over a dozen other people who have
inquired these past weeks - that I knew the consultancy's name. After all,
such an unusual chief executive would *Knowledge for Action. Jossey-Bass,
San Francisco (ISBN 1-55542-519-4). Dollars 29.85.
surely have interesting things to say. But since the professor scrupulously
refrains from identifying the outfit, I'd settled for disappointment . . .
until the fax suddenly reeled out a message from the rare specimen himself.
He is 39-year-old Mark Fuller, and his consultancy is the Monitor Company
based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He tells me it started in 1983, and over
the next three years grew to employ nearly 100 people. Meanwhile, however,
the distrustful politicking was blocking useful action to the extent that
the business was in danger of breaking apart.
Then came the decision to call in Chris Argyris and start the remedial
programme. And what is the result?
Today, Monitor has over 460 on its payroll, including 350 consultants. It
has three United States branches and others in Toronto, Tokyo, Seoul, Milan,
Munich, Madrid and London besides the European headquarters in Amsterdam.
The chief executive says US clients include 17 of the top 35 companies
listed by Fortune, and comparably substantial organisations in other lands.
'So getting to grips with our political difficulties looks to have paid
off,' he adds.
Since the task must have sharpened his consultant's eye for similar
snake-pits elsewhere, does he think that the problems which bedevil
organisations are more often political than of the financial or other
technical kinds?
'In most cases I see, not only are the majority of the problems political,
but the proportion is growing. Companies have greater technical resources
than they had in 1983 - spreadsheets, for one example. But that kind of
expertise can't help if there are taboos on sharing or even collecting
certain information, or when the truth dare not be told.'
Does he agree with Chris Argyris that the prime cause of such troubles is,
not anything anyone does badly, but a polished skill virtually all of us
begin acquiring before we can walk?
(The professor thinks the root is the defensive tactic of countering
personal threats by first bypassing the problem, then covering up the
by-pass, covering up the cover-up and so on. Hence the law of organisational
stupidity named after him, Argyris's Archetype, which states: The more
threatening a problem to those responsible for solving it, the deeper it
will become ingrained under ramifying layers of camouflage.)
'For the most part, yes,' Mark Fuller says. 'The root is defensive
manoeuvres by individuals, although the trouble doesn't always start in the
top ranks as it did with us. But when it does, it sure as hell cascades
downwards, spreading and intertwining as it goes.'
When Monitor's consultants see a client concern is stricken by politicking,
how safe do they feel in saying as much to its chiefs? After all, the top
bosses may well owe their own positions to playing the power game better
than more technically capable people below.
'Well, that might be so - and the only reason they're offering us an
assignment could be that they want a report that helps their play. But in
that case, it would soon be clear to both them and us that we wouldn't get
along. If we're going to be able to help clients, we must be free to tell
the truth.'
There are, however, more and less useful ways of telling it, he adds. One of
the lessons Monitor has learned from Chris Argyris is that people's
self-protective manoeuvring can only be made worse by talking to them in a
way that makes them feel more threatened than they were in the first place.
Discussions must be 'crafted' to avoid triggering defensive reflexes.
'So long as that's done,' Mr Fuller says, 'we find clients are more and more
ready to face up to what's really stopping them from being effective. For
one thing, they'll usually have tried out technical prescriptions like total
quality and so on, and found they don't work. For another, these days there
are fewer safe havens where businesses snarled up by power games can
survive.
'Of course, that doesn't apply in the not-for-profit sector, where they're
still flourishing - and I don't simply mean government organisations.
Universities, for example, are as bad as any.'
Nor would he except the schools of management. Although he has lost the
close knowledge of them he had as a student and tutor at Harvard Business
School, they strike him as paying scant heed to political problems as
opposed to the technical sort.
'Mind you, universities aren't geared to teaching the lessons we've had to
learn. The only way is by concentrated experience which is evilly
frustrating because, try as you might to get rid of them, the defensive
routines keep reasserting themselves. There's so much deep habit to be
unlearned before you can start learning to act differently. Even though it's
seven years since we called in Chris Argyris, we're still short of a clean
bill of health.
'But there's one thing I can assure you. Nobody who had changed to the new
way of working would ever want to go back to the old one.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / NHS to switch research funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Health yesterday announced plans to switch most of the
National Health Service's spending on research and development, currently
Pounds 316m a year, to the assessment of new drugs, medical equipment and
other treatments.
The strategy for creating an 'evaluative culture' in the service is
contained in a health department document published yesterday. The strategy
includes closer links with industry and the publication of guidelines on the
best health technologies.
'Quality care will reach patients through the efforts of well-informed
health professionals and managers,' said Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, announcing the programme.
An expert commission will compare, for example, the treatment of kidney
disease with drugs or with dialysis equipment.
The results will be disseminated by a new team of marketing and media
specialists.
Professor Michael Peckham, author of the document, said this should
encourage hospitals to make use of new treatments more quickly. 'There is
generally a poor uptake of research findings by clinicians and health
service managers,' he said.
But the plans received a mixed response from the medical technology
industries. 'We question the competence of bureaucratic committees to
evaluate different treatments,' said Mr John Griffin, chairman of the
Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries.
Mr David MacKenzie of the British Healthcare Industries Association, which
represents medical equipment manufacturers, said: 'Britain has a trade
surplus in medical equipment, but this is falling. What we really need is
money to develop new equipment.'
Prof Peckham said the new programme would eventually see more than half the
service's research and development budget spent on technology assessment.
The commission will also look at new strategies in such areas as community
care, hospital staffing and how research and development funds are allocated
to hospitals.
As well as technology assessment, the NHS will establish a set of goals in
research and 'initiate major programmes of R&amp;D on NHS priority topics'.
Prof Peckham said that it was difficult to know what existing research
projects, if any, would be dropped to provide cash for the assessment
programme because an audit of the way money is currently spent was not
finished.
The health service spends 1.1 per cent of its budget on research, a figure
that Mrs Bottomley has said will rise to 1.5 per cent.
'The R&amp;D initiative will ensure that knowledge-based quality care becomes a
reality,' she said.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Scots tourism aid put on new footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to re-organise the way it helps Scotland's tourist
industry, doing away with a structure which critics say is fragmented and
ineffective.
The Scottish Tourist Board will continue to be responsible for marketing
Scotland as a tourist destination and will take over marketing the Highlands
and Islands from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body.
But the tourist board will no longer give financial assistance and advice to
tourism businesses. This will be the responsibility of Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the two umbrella development bodies
which operate through a network of local enterprise companies - the
equivalent of the Training and Enterprise Councils in England. The
development bodies already disburse the bulk of official aid to tourist
businesses.
A co-ordinating group to be set up under Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the
Scottish Office minister, will draw up a national strategic plan.
The Edinburgh-based tourist board will be told to establish by 1995 a
'substantial office' in Inverness, the Highland capital. This is expected to
involve moving about 50 jobs to Inverness. The number of area tourist
boards, which undertake local promotion and assistance, is to be cut from
more than 30 to fewer than 10.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday government spending on
developing and promoting tourism in Scotland would be about the same - about
Pounds 50m - but the money would be better spent.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Building chiefs to question banks on 'harmful' policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARTERED Institute of Building, which represents building managers and
directors, is to hold meetings with the four main clearing banks in the next
two months to discuss concerns about the banks' attitude to the construction
industry.
The move follows publication of a survey this week by the institute which
found that, of 1,300 members questioned, three quarters believed that banks
had a negative policy towards the industry.
The survey also found that 49 per cent of those questioned felt the industry
was moving out of recession, but was not being helped by the banks.
The survey could fuel the often acrimonious debate about the banks' attitude
to industry, but the institute said yesterday it was not aiming to 'hit the
banks'.
The institute said: 'We want to make them aware of the problems of our
members, and we also want to have a teamwork approach to finding a solution.
We know that the banks have their shareholders to consider.'
As a result of the survey the big banks were criticised yesterday by Mr
Nigel Jones, the Liberal Democrat housing spokesman.
Mr Jones said: 'Construction is the key to recovery. The banks by their
attitude are harming any recovery in the building and construction
industry.'
Mr Jones said the Department of Trade and Industry should take action to
ensure that the construction industry received the support it needs from the
big banks. 'If there ever was a case for intervention this is it,' he said.
Mr Jones tabled three Commons questions last week on the issue, for answer
by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. He has asked Mr Gummer what steps
he is taking to ensure that the construction industry is given enough
financial support to enable it to expand.
It is understood that the banks are upset by the institute's survey, and
that their own studies have produced different conclusions. An unpublished
study for Barclays in March found that 60 per cent of construction companies
had a 'good or excellent' relationship with their bank.
Among other findings of the institute's survey, 41 per cent of those polled
envisaged they would be making further redundancies this year.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Lloyd's risks losing its top agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL Lloyd's agencies may be about to quit the insurance market in the
wake of record losses, Chatset, the research company which monitors Lloyd's,
has warned.
'Names must watch the situation closely to ensure that Lloyd's does not
become an agglomeration of the second-rank agencies, with the leading
agencies splitting themselves off and becoming autonomous insurance
companies,' said Chatset yesterday, presenting its review of the market's
performance in 1990.
Lloyd's last week reported a loss of Pounds 2.91bn for 1990, the last year
for which it has released figures.
Chatset added: 'There are signs that Lloyd's may be breaking up through
successful agencies declining to support a market which has notched up
substantial losses through bad management and poor underwriting,'
Last month five Lloyd's agencies put members' agents 'on notice' that they
might not be prepared to continue managing syndicates in 1994.
In at least two of the cases the agencies are contesting new rules which cap
the level of fees they can charge Names - the individuals whose assets
support the insurance market.
Chatset said some agents 'wonder if they need Lloyd's at all to run a
commercial organisation'.
The company's review of the 1990 results shows a wide variation in the
performance of the syndicates trading at the market. While five marine
syndicates reported profits of more than 10 per cent of their stamp capacity
 -the premium they are allowed to underwrite according to Lloyd's rules - 18
marine syndicates reported losses of more than 100 per cent of their stamp
capacity.
Syndicates 475 and 745, both of which specialise in catastrophe reinsurance,
were the two worst-performing syndicates, with losses equal to more than 200
per cent of capacity.
Syndicate 952, a small non-marine syndicate, was the best performer in 1990.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Doctors reject role as 'health police'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS WOULD not act as the 'Department of Social Security health police'
when handling invalidity benefit claims, Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the
British Medical Association general medical services committee, said
yesterday.
The BMA annual representative meeting in Torquay angrily condemned
government suggestions that an over-lenient approach by doctors was fuelling
a rapid growth in invalidity benefit expenditure - one of the areas
earmarked for possible savings in the government's long-term review of
social security spending.
During the last 10 years the number of people receiving the benefit has
risen from 700,000 to 1.5m. Expenditure has more than doubled in real terms
over the same period to Pounds 6bn a year and is likely to reach Pounds 8bn
by 1995-96. Ministers have said invalidity payments are one of the
fastest-growing social security benefits at a time when the nation's health
has been improving.
But the association conference adopted a motion rejecting government
assertions that general practitioners did not understand the criteria for
sickness certification in relation to fitness for work.
Dr Peter Holden, who moved the motion, said that there had been a government
whispering campaign suggesting that doctors were conniving with patients to
issue false sick notes.
There were many possible explanations for the increase in benefit claims,
the conference heard. Manufacturing industries that had once kept people
with sickness problems in light work could no longer provide this, while the
prime minister should be aware of the links between unemployment,
deprivation and sickness. Dr Holden received prolonged cheers when he
declared: 'I am a family doctor, not the SS of the DSS.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Christie's in plan to aid stricken Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ANOTHER sign of the ripples that the record losses at Lloyd's are sending
through the art world, Christie's, the fine-art auctioneers, announced
yesterday that it had joined Coutts bank to provide a rescue package for
Lloyd's Names.
Under the scheme Names can raise a bank guarantee at Coutts for up to 40 per
cent of the value of their works of art.
The move comes as art dealers report a surge of inquiries from Names who are
seeking to sell art works and heirlooms to meet cash demands for the record
losses unveiled at Lloyd's last week - losses that have left the 27,770
Names facing average bills of Pounds 100,000.
A six-month cash advance on works of art to be sold at Christie's is
available for Names faced with immediate cashflow problems, Christie's
added.
Mr Anthony Browne, director of Christie's, denied yesterday that the move
was intended to rival a scheme which Sotheby's announced earlier this month.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Corporate fraud rises sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE FRAUD has risen sharply to more than Pounds 571m in the first four
months of 1993, according to figures compiled by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm, Andrew Jack writes.
Its 'fraud barometer', which catalogues press reports of UK criminal fraud
charges exceeding Pounds 100,000, shows there have been 355 cases involving
a total of Pounds 2.2bn since 1987.
Nearly 60 per cent of fraud since last year has been committed by top
management, 13 per cent by middle management and 22 per cent by employees.
In the first third of this year, the figure of Pounds 571m included Pounds
489m in charges connected to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The total figure for last year was Pounds 671m.
Of the other 13 cases detected in 1993, nearly half were brought against
lawyers or accountants and the average charge was Pounds 6.3m.
Over the last seven years, more than one third of fraudsters charged were
aged between 41 and 50, and a further 30 per cent were between 31 and 40.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Getting out there and learning some street cred: The
enthusiastic man from the ministry who has been lent by the DTI to TI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS JACKSON is stoical about a salary which looks distinctly sickly
alongside the pay of his immediate colleagues.
As a strategic development executive with TI Group, the specialist
engineering company, he plays an important role in determining its future
shape and direction. But many of those around him are paid much more
handsomely.
Mr Jackson, however, is not what he seems. A temporary addition to the small
management team which operates from TI's global headquarters in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire, he is normally found behind a desk at the Department of Trade
and Industry in London's Victoria.
Mr Jackson is a civil servant. He has been for nearly 30 years, working his
way up to grade 5 - assistant secretary - level. He intends to remain a
servant of the government which continues to pay his usual salary while he
is out of town.
The only perk of his present job is the car provided by TI to make the daily
60-mile journey from his home in Sunbury, Surrey. 'I have made a long
investment in my career. Remuneration in the private sector is undeniably
higher but I would have to think three times before changing horses,' he
says.
Mr Jackson, at 46, has become part of the drive, renewed under Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to build a new partnership
between the government and industry. The temporary attachment of civil
servants to private companies - conducted in parallel with a programme of
inward recruitment - is hardly new, but the DTI is giving fresh priority to
the strategy.
By the end of last year more than 50 of Mr Heseltine's staff were working on
long-term secondment outside his department, while nearly 60 external
recruits, possessing what Mr Heseltine calls 'street cred', were working in
the DTI. The number is now growing as Mr Heseltine extends the principle
throughout the department.
Before his recruitment to TI, Mr Jackson headed part of the DTI's
environment unit, encouraging businesses to commit themselves to sensible
environmental strategies and also dealing with a range of UK and EC
environmental agencies in the development of policy.
The move to Abingdon meant a new role and something of a culture shock. He
had to field the inevitable jokes about a civil servant's lifestyle,
although he insists the sheer daily volume of work flowing across his DTI
desk is greater than anything he has experienced at TI.
His new colleagues, while expressing curiosity about the internal workings
of government, also made it clear that his government department was not
particularly highly rated, a view which he believes is now changing as Mr
Heseltine gives the department a new remit and fresh focus.
Enlisted at TI to help Mr James Roe, director of strategic development, Mr
Jackson was put to work on medium-term planning for the group, analysing
markets, identifying areas for potential growth and putting potential
acquisitions under the microscope.
His arrival last year came weeks before TI launched its hostile bid for
Dowty, the aerospace components manufacturer. He immediately joined the team
building up a detailed profile of the bid target and, after the takeover,
toured Dowty factories to see how they would fit in to the expanded group.
'Some things strike you at once,' says Mr Jackson, summing up the
differences which separate two very different worlds. 'Life is very much
more fluid and flexible. You have to self-start more and work doesn't follow
a regular pattern. In the DTI, you have a job description which is unlikely
to change from one year to the next.'
Mr Jackson says that at TI, 'you do what needs to be done and you do it
quickly. The pace of events is much faster and there is speedier
decision-making. In government, there are so many people you have to get on
side before you can make any serious moves.'
The need for public accountability, he says, can also act as a drag on
decision-making and he stresses that while accountability remains an
important factor in the private sector, the systems governing it are
'slicker'.
In spite of the equanimity with which he views the prospect of returning to
the civil service at the end of the year, Mr Jackson believes he has been
extremely fortunate to get to the heart of a highly successful international
company. Any DTI colleagues, he says, should jump at the chance to spend
time in a manufacturing company.
But how will his experience in the outside world help the DTI do its job
when he returns to the department? 'A lot of what I have seen merely
reinforces the instincts I already had. But I hope my time here has helped
me understand how companies think, how they see us and how we can better
help each other. The DTI spends a lot of time trying to exhort business,
which always has to relate things to the bottom line, to do things for its
own good. If we can understand its obligations and priorities, so much the
better.'
What will he miss most when he leaves? 'The sheer variety of tasks and the
unexpected nature of the job, which made me uncomfortable at first but which
I now thoroughly enjoy.'
Neither is he entirely convinced about swapping the gardens and fountains of
TI headquarters for the noise and grime of Victoria. 'The other morning I
had to pull up and let a duck lead its babies across the road. You don't do
that too often outside the DTI.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Small companies suffer as failures increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in company failures among small traders throughout the UK has pushed
business collapses to a record. The figures underline the fragile state of
much of industry in spite of signs of recovery.
Taking in England, Wales and Scotland, business collapses totalled 17,005 in
the second quarter of this year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information
company, said yesterday. This is the highest three-monthly figure since Dun
&amp; Bradstreet started collecting data in 1980.
The collapses are mainly at the level of small businesses, which are going
under at the rate of nearly 1,000 a week throughout the country.
Separately, the Bankruptcy Association yesterday said that personal
bankruptcies in Britain have continued to increase in the first six months
of 1993 - rising 12.5 per cent on the same period last year to 21,678. The
association said the rise in personal bankruptcies was being fuelled
increasingly by professional groups, such as accountants and solicitors,
going under in the wake of clients.
The overall Dun &amp; Bradstreet second-quarter figure was inflated largely
because Scottish business failures rose 35 per cent between the first and
second quarters, from 2,795 to 3,770. In England and Wales, the upward trend
is much less marked, although business failures still rose 5 per cent from
12,648 in the first quarter to 13,235 in the second quarter. In the fourth
quarter of last year the figure was 13,397.
The year-on-year rate of collapses is coming down in London, and has
increased only marginally in south-east England, while Wales has seen a big
fall.
This supports notions that the regions which were first into the recession
are ahead of others in coming out of it.
In the first six months, total failures came to 32,448, from 62,767 in the
whole of last year. Between January and March this year 15,443 businesses
went under.
Throughout the country, big companies appear to be relatively resilient as
they attempt to rebuild sales after the recession. This is highlighted by
the 5,430 limited companies being liquidated in the second quarter - a muted
2 per cent rise on the 5,297 forced out of business in the first three
months.
Bankruptcies of small traders went up 14 per cent from 10,146 to 11,575 over
the same period.
Taking in the whole of the first half of this year, 25,883 businesses
collapsed in England and Wales - little changed on the 25,683 in the
comparable time last year.
London had 3,381 failures, down 2 per cent on the same period in 1992.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Speaking out on a delicate matter
of principle / A look at Michael Mates's clash with Betty Boothroyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAMATIC clashes in the Commons as Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker,
repeatedly warned Mr Michael Mates to look again at what he was planning to
say, brought an often-unnoticed area of Westminster procedure into the
spotlight - the sub judice rule.
Although such speeches are normally heard in silence, Miss Boothroyd was
driven again and again to interrupt Mr Mates's personal statement, insisting
that he should not give MPs information that could be used in a future
trial.
The legislation about contempt of court does not apply to the House of
Commons, but MPs are bound by a self-denying ordinance that dates from 1963.
After an inquiry by a cross-party committee the Commons decided that, in
general, matters awaiting decision in the criminal court should not be
raised in debates, motions or questions, from the time proceedings were set
in motion until the court's decision. A similar bar would operate if an
appeal were launched until that too had been resolved.
At the heart of the rule is the risk of the Commons affecting the outcome of
proceedings so it includes any matters that might prejudice a case, beyond
simply the question of expressing a view on whether a defendant is guilty.
There are parallel rules about matters before the civil courts, which were
slightly amended in 1972.
Few areas at Westminster are completely clear-cut, however, and there are
exceptions to this self-denial on the part of the Commons - notably in the
speaker's discretion to allow matters to be referred to in spite of
impending proceedings.
Usually this discretion is exercised to allow matters to be mentioned where
the risk of prejudice to proceedings is slight.
This might be, for example, because a case is awaiting appeal in a higher
court and judges can reasonably be thought to be less affected by what is
said in the Commons than a jury might be.
Another example might be where it was clear that there was no possible
likelihood of the defendant being brought to justice.
Lawyers yesterday said it was doubtful that even had Mr Mates made his
remarks outside Parliament they would have resulted in contempt-of-court
proceedings against him.
Mr David Kirk, head of the fraud unit at City solicitors Stephenson Harwood,
said that although the Polly Peck case was technically sub judice, Miss
Boothroyd appeared to have taken the sub judice rule too far.
For there to be a contempt there had to be 'a substantial risk of serious
prejudice' to a fair trial. It was arguable that there was no realistic
prospect of a trial now taking place which could be prejudiced by Mr Mates's
statement.
If the case against Mr Nadir did eventually come to court it was unlikely to
be within the next two years. 'The courts have always taken the view that
time is a great healer as far as prejudice is concerned', Mr Kirk said.
If Miss Boothroyd's argument were followed to its logical conclusion and the
trial never took place, then no one would ever be able to comment on the
case again, he added.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour backs McNamara in Ulster
document row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBARRASSED Labour leadership yesterday repudiated an internal paper that
suggested joint British/Irish rule as an option for Northern Ireland - and
led Mr John Major to call for the party's spokesman on the province to be
sacked.
Labour officials said the report for Mr Kevin Mc-Namara, shadow Northern
Ireland secretary, had been prepared before the general election. It had not
been seen by the shadow cabinet, Mr Neil Kinnock, then party leader, or by
his successor, Mr John Smith.
The paper, which angered Unionist MPs was now 'invalid', Labour said. There
was no question of Mr McNamara being sacked, it added.
Mr McNamara confirmed that the options explored were not Labour policy and
he would not be offering his resignation. He also ruled out Labour backing
an independent Ulster. However some of the leaked proposals were consistent
with Mr McNamara's thinking on Northern Ireland - which has consistently
infuriated Unionist MPs. Labour's 1992 manifesto pledged to work within the
1985 Anglo-Irish agreement 'to achieve our policy of unity by consent'.
The discussion paper sets out a number of ways that objective might be
achieved - including 'shared responsibility' between Britain and the Irish
republic.
Mr McNamara plans to publish this autumn a discussion paper on Northern
Ireland that will build on the leaked paper's proposals. He backs
'round-table' talks between nationalist and unionist politicians but
believes unionists should not necessarily be allowed a veto, and that if
negotiations break down, the two governments should look to set up new
political institutions.
The prime minister said the leaked proposals for joint rule were 'a recipe
for disaster'. The Labour leader had 'an obligation to tell the people of
Northern Ireland whether or not that is the policy of their party,' Mr Major
said.

Mr Scargill said later he was 'saddened' by Mr Neilson's attack.

PUBLIC CONCERN at the number of cases considered by the Crown prosecution
service which do not lead to court proceedings was acknowledged by Mr David
Maclean, home office minister, last night, Ivor Owen writes.
Before the Criminal Justice Bill received its third Commons reading, he said
he would discuss the matter with ministerial colleagues, adding: 'This is

A Labour clause seeking to introduce a code of practice on liaison between
the courts, the police and local authorities was defeated by a government
majority of 47 (278-231).

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mates points to Polly case
'incosistency' - Former minister 'lays out the facts' to MPs concerning his
relationship with Asil Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is an edited version of the central allegations and the
sequence of events outlined by Mr Michael Mates to the House of Commons
yesterday.
My involvement began in the autumn of 1991, through a constituent who
brought me details of alleged wrongdoing by the authorities in the case of
Mr Nadir. I asked to meet Mr Nadir himself.
Some of his complaints concerned his advisers in the City; others concerned
official institutions, the Inland Revenue, the Serious Fraud Office and the
police.
With Mr Nadir's permission, I spoke to Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, until
recently chairman of the Bar. It was clear that the defence team were
concerned at some of the matters which had arisen during the course of the
prosecution.
I met the then attorney-general to express my concern. At his request I then
wrote to him the first of the letters that have brought me to the position
in which I find myself today. The only person who had copies of those
letters are the attorney-general, Mr Nadir and the SFO. It is a matter
perhaps of speculation as to who leaked the letter to the press last week.
It was claimed that I was embarrassed by this leak. Far from it. Three days
previously I had asked the attorney-general's permission to publish all of
the correspondence between us because I felt it was the only way to bring
out into the open the reason for my involvement. The attorney-general
indicated that this might give him some difficulty. I respected that view
and will continue to do so.
Of course I understand why the press would publish a letter or any other
material that was leaked to them. I make no criticism of them for that. I
just ask that, with me gone, inquiring journalists will now ask the
question: why was material being selectively leaked to them? Whose agenda
was being served by its publication?
Many have asked why I became involved in this case and why I continued my
involvement after I joined the government. I must say at once that on the
latter point I took careful advice that it was proper for me to pursue this
matter as a minister.
Let me simply lay out the facts as they were presented to me. I start with
the raid on South Audley Management, a property management company
controlled by Mr Nadir's family, on September 19 1991.
Inevitably, the publicity surrounding the raid had a serious effect on the
share price of Polly Peck International, or PPI. The following day, the
20th, Mr Nadir was asked to go to the SFO headquarters in Elm Street for an
interview during which time his presence was announced to the press.
On October 30, the SFO mounted a highly publicised raid on the headquarters
of PPI in Berkeley Square. In fact, 10 minutes before the police arrived,
journalists had knocked on the door and told PPI staff they were there in
answer to an invitation from the SFO.
But there's a further point. By that time, PPI was already in
administration. By arrangement with the administrators, the SFO had already
had full access to PPI headquarters and to all the documents there. Their
people were already working inside the building. The SFO were effectively
launching a raid, in the full glare of publicity, against the
administrators.
This clearly had a cumulative effect on the public's perception both of PPI
and of Mr Nadir.
A process of what some might call 'trial by media' had begun, aided and
encouraged by the SFO.
For their part the SFO have consistently maintained that their
investigations and thus their ability to bring the case to trial have been
hampered and delayed by their inability to operate in Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus.'
The defence therefore offered an opportunity to short-circuit this problem.
In June 1991 they commissioned Binder Hamlyn, one of Britain's leading
accountancy firms, to carry out their own investigation into the
relationship between Polly Peck in London and its subsidiaries in northern
Cyprus, which formed the basis of the charges.
The SFO's first response was that Binder Hamlyn must have been shown forged
documents. When the defence then presented the SFO with a report from an
independent forensic expert, on the SFO's approved list, saying this was not
so, they changed their ground and, despite requests from the defence to go
to northern Cyprus to check the accounts, they have maintained that this
would be impossible because northern Cyprus was not a recognised country.
It is well-known that the police have on occasions visited northern Cyprus
to make inquiries in connection with criminal proceedings in this country
and I simply do not understand why they could not follow the usual practice.
There seems, too, to be some inconsistency over who made the complaints
which the SFO were investigating. The present charges do not arise as a
result of a complaint by the Stock Exchange and there is evidence of
improper collusion between a senior officer of the Inland Revenue and the
SFO. While the SFO deny any such collusions the officer involved has
admitted it to a journalist, whose name I know, and who would be happy to
give the details of this illegal collusion to an independent inquiry.
Mr Nadir and his advisers believe that he has been denied the opportunity
properly to prepare his defence. They also believe that he has in the
process been denied his rights under the law.
During the raid on Polly Peck's headquarters in October 1990 many documents
were seized. Professional privilege was claimed by Mr Nadir's lawyers and it
was agreed that these documents would be placed in sealed bags until the
issue was resolved by independent counsel. He found that the vast majority
of the documents in the sealed bags were privileged documents.
But before counsel saw these papers the SFO had opened the bags. They have
admitted that two bags were opened but they claim it was due to a
misunderstanding. In fact more than two bags were opened because other
papers from other bags have found their way into the hands of the
administrators.
I turn finally to what the House may view as the most serious aspect of this
whole affair, namely that quite improper pressure has apparently been
exercised by the SFO upon the trial judge Mr Justice Tucker. It is this
sequence of events above all which demands independent inquiry.
On November 6, in court during the hearing of an application to vary Mr
Nadir's bail, counsel for the SFO said in court that police were
investigating a complaint that there was a conspiracy to bribe Mr Justice
Tucker, the trial judge, and that he should consider standing down because
it might be necessary to interview him.
The allegation was that a sum of money would be paid to the judge following
the success of the application to vary bail.
And at a subsequent hearing in December the chief superintendent responsible
for investigating the allegation of attempted bribery, told the court, when
cross-examined, that he had never had evidence which would justify
interviewing the judge, nor had the police ever declared their intention to
do so.
The only conclusion is that the SFO misled the judge about the intentions of
the police. The House will realise that the mere making of such an
allegation in court could compromise any chance of the judge being seen to
be impartial.
Quite rightly he refused to give up the case. Then at a hearing in March
1993 another bizarre suggestion was made by counsel, namely that the police
were investigating a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
The suspected conspirators were, said counsel, Mr Nadir, Mr Wyn Jones,
assistant commissioner of Metropolitan Police, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC and
the judge himself, Mr Justice Tucker.
Needless to say the police have not ever questioned the judge, Mr Wyn Jones
or Mr Scrivener. This appears to have been a deliberate attempt to
destabilise the defence.
The day before, as on the day before so many preparatory hearings, Mr Nadir
was arrested. He was cautioned and interviewed on suspicion of a conspiracy
to pervert the course of justice and the co-conspirators I have mentioned
were named.
At the end of the interview his solicitor inquired as to whether any other
of the suspected conspirators had been arrested or interviewed. The House
will not be surprised to learn that the answer to this was 'no'.
The cumulative effect of what had happened in March and April - the alleged
bribery of the judge, the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and
the seizing of his defence papers - left Mr Nadir in a state of severe
depression and despair.
It was in that context that a decision was taken to raise his spirits and
that was the context in which I made the fateful decision to give him the
watch.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Claims of 'improper pressure'
rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE MOST potentially damaging claim by Mr Mates
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that the Serious Fraud Office had applied 'improper pressure' on the trial
judge, Mr Justice Tucker - was dismissed as 'complete nonsense' last night
by a central figure involved in the investigations into the allegations of
corruption surrounding the Polly Peck trial.
The source - in no way connected with the SFO - said it was not the SFO that
had made the original allegation. The Metropolitan Police, initially
considered the claim - that an attempt might be made to bribe Mr Justice
Tucker using a Pounds 3.5m slush fund - worthy of investigation.
However, police soon discounted the possibility that a serious attempt had
been planned the bribe the judge. It was never discovered exactly who was
behind the bribery allegations, but it was considered to be an attempt to
disrupt the legal proceedings against Mr Nadir by generally 'muddying the
waters'.
The later allegations that Mr Nadir, Mr Wyn Jones of the Met Police, Mr
Anthony Scrivener QC, counsel for Mr Nadir and the trial judge were involved
in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice were dismissed even faster.
One lawyer close to the case decribed the allegation as 'totally laughable'.
Mr Justice Tucker declined to comment on Mr Mates's statement. Mr Scrivener
also last night refused to comment.
When the corruption allegations were first made last November Mr Robert Owen
QC, the barrister who is bringing the Polly Peck prosecution for the SFO,
did invite the trial judge to consider his position in the light of the
claims.
However, the source last night denied Mr Owen had acted improperly, pointing
out that the Scotland Yard investigation of the corruption allegations was
under way and that a change of judge would not have significantly affected
Mr Nadir's trial.
The suggestion that Mr Owen had tried to mislead the judge over the police
investigation during the hearings - heard in camera - was complete nonsense,
he said.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major urged to admit pit rescue was
a 'fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should come clean over coal and admit the rescue package it
unveiled in March had been exposed as a 'fraud', Mr John Smith told MPs
yesterday as he clashed with Mr John Major over continuing pit closures.
Anticipating next week's Commons debate in which Labour hopes to rekindle
public interest in the industry's future, the Labour leader said three of
the 12 pits that the government had led parliament to believe would be
reprieved now faced closure.
Was it not a 'perfect example' of the government's style that a white paper
produced for '36 hours' publicity' had not survived for three months in the
real world, he asked.
But Mr Major cited remarks made by Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, that the Labour leadership was 'more
interested in opinion polls and images than in principles and real
policies'.
Some of the threatened pits had geological problems resulting in excessively
high costs, Mr Major said. In two cases, the miners themselves had voted to
close pits - in one case immediately.
Mr Smith said if miners did not vote for closure, they stood to lose
redundancy payments. British Coal was offering coal at 'a knockdown price'
that would give the consumer cheaper electricity than from any other source,
he said.
Mr Smith added: 'If the two privatised generators still won't buy at that
price, does it not prove the market is rigged against coal, and if this goes
on, pit after pit will close and we will lose a vital industry?'
Mr Major replied that the coal industry had been closing in size every year
over the last 30 years.
At least one Conservative backbencher intends either to abstain or vote with
Labour after next Monday's debate.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, calls in an interview today for Tories to
rally round Mr John Major and stop behaving 'like the Labour party used to'.
Mr Clarke told the Daily Express that the prime minister had already 'come
through the worst' of his unpopularity.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour backs McNamara in Ulster
document row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBARRASSED Labour leadership yesterday repudiated an internal paper that
suggested joint British/Irish rule as an option for Northern Ireland - and
led Mr John Major to call for the party's spokesman on the province to be
sacked.
Labour officials said the report for Mr Kevin Mc-Namara, shadow Northern
Ireland secretary, had been prepared before the general election. It had not
been seen by the shadow cabinet, Mr Neil Kinnock, then party leader, or by
his successor, Mr John Smith.
The paper, which angered Unionist MPs was now 'invalid', Labour said. There
was no question of Mr McNamara being sacked, it added.
Mr McNamara confirmed that the options explored were not Labour party policy
and he would not be offering his resignation. He also ruled out Labour
backing an independent Ulster.
However some of the leaked proposals were consistent with Mr McNamara's
thinking on Northern Ireland - which has consistently infuriated Unionist
MPs. Labour's 1992 manifesto pledged to work within the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement 'to achieve our policy of unity by consent'.
The discussion paper sets out a number of ways that objective might be
achieved - including 'shared responsibility' between Britain and the Irish
republic, and the Irish president and the Queen having joint sovereignty
over the province.
Mr McNamara plans to publish this autumn a discussion paper on Northern
Ireland that will build on the leaked paper's proposals.
He backs 'round-table' talks between nationalist and unionist politicians
but believes unionists should not be allowed a veto, and that if
negotiations break down, the two governments should look to set up new
political institutions.
The prime minister said the leaked proposals for joint rule were 'a recipe
for disaster'. The Labour leader had 'an obligation to tell the people of
Northern Ireland whether or not that is the policy of their party,' Mr Major
said.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the
proposals were a recipe for 'civil war worse than anything we have
experienced in the north of Ireland or the south of Ireland'.
Unionist MPs' attacks on Mr McNamara diverted attention from his criticism
earlier this week of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
under pressure for a 'gaffe' at the weekend when he joked with reporters
after a terrorist attack.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scargill attacked by NUM official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
yesterday faced an unusually direct attack on his leadership from one of his
own officials who said he had brought the union 'close to extinction'.
Mr Peter Neilson, vice-president of the Scottish area, told the union's
annual conference in Scarborough that Mr Scargill was 'totally out of touch'
with his members and that the union had 'stumbled from one defeat to
another, continually losing credibility while slowly sinking into oblivion'.
The Scottish area of the union has been one of the most outspoken in
attacking Mr Scargill but rarely in front of him and never in such outspoken
language at a union conference.
The object of Mr Neilson's attack was the NUM's refusal to negotiate over
pay with British Coal for the past nine years because of the 'majority'
principle.
This allows the rival Union of Democratic Mineworkers to represent NUM
members in pits where the UDM has a majority.
He said the NUM was failing its members 'miserably' and was not carrying out
the basic principle of trade unionism to protect and improve wages. 'Whether
we like it or not the UDM does exist and to deny that is to fool yourself
and do your members a disservice,' he added.
Mr Scargill said he was 'saddened' by the attack.
In spite of Mr Neilson's remarks, Mr Scargill appears to have settled into
the president's job for another five years because of the unwillingness of
any NUM member to take legal action against him.
Under trade union laws Mr Scargill should have been re-elected in January,
five years after his initial election.

FT  30 JUN 93 / BSkyB to offer 20 pay-channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, is planning to
offer a subscription package of up to 20 channels by the end of this year.
BSkyB intends to launch the package with 14 channels - more than had been
expected - on September 1. Further channels will then be added within a
matter of months.
The satellite venture has made it clear for some time that it plans to
scramble all its television channels so that only those who pay a monthly
subscription will be able to watch them.
At the moment channels such as Sky One and Sky News are freely available to
those with satellite dishes.
The charge for the new channel package will be Pounds 5.99 a month, although
the 2.4m homes already taking a subscription channel such as Sky Movies or
Sky Sport will not pay extra. The channels not owned by BSkyB will be paid a
proportion on a per-subscriber basis.
The new satellite package will mirror the economics of cable television,
where a basic tier of channels is offered for a set fee and viewers can then
choose to pay for other subscription services.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, plans to back the move to subscription with a big
promotion to try to prevent losing the custom of households that now watch
only the 'free' channels. BSkyB claims that its channels are available in
3.9m homes in the UK by all methods of distribution.
The new subscription package will include Sky One; Sky News; UK Gold - the
library channel that links Thames and the BBC; Children's Channel;
Nickelodeon - the US children's channel; TVC - the home shopping channel;
Discovery - the factual channel; Bravo - broadcasting classic films; Country
Music channel; The Family Channel; Nick at Night from the US; VH 1 - a US
music channel; and UK Living - a women's channel.
In addition BSkyB hopes that MTV, the pop-music channel, will join the
package by September.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Thorp delay costs 1,700 jobs at Sellafield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED contract workers at Sellafield are to lose their jobs in
the next few weeks because of the government's decision to hold more public
consultations on the need for the site's new Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing
plant, British Nuclear Fuels said yesterday.
BNF also announced that it is to make redundant 1,500 of its employees,
mostly white-collar engineering, design and administration staff at its
headquarters at Risley, Cheshire, over the next two years.
The company, which estimates that the delay in commissioning the Thermal
Oxide Reprocessing Plant is costing Pounds 2.4m a week, said the 1,500 job
cuts, amounting to 10 per cent of its employees, were necessary to make it
more competitive for the future.
The cost so far to BNF of the delay in live commissioning of Thorp, which
had been scheduled for January this year, is estimated at nearly Pounds 50m.
That is certain to rise by tens of millions of pounds following Monday's
Commons announcement of more public consultation, delaying a final decision
on Thorp's future until late autumn.
BNF has already forecast that its 1992-93 pre-tax profit, to be announced
next month, will be about Pounds 60m down on the Pounds 161m figure for
1991-92.
The company, which has a Pounds 9bn order book for Thorp, attacked the
Department of the Environment's decision yesterday. 'These further
bureaucratic delays by DoE and HMIP Policy Branch could have been avoided
with good management,' it said. The delay, it warned, would deter other
industrialists from investment in the UK, in case regulatory bodies later
forced closure of plant they deemed unnecessary.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, criticised the delay, saying it
could have worrying implications for other industrial development.
Speaking to the British Nuclear Forum in London last night, he said:
'Business needs greater certainty in planning and environmental policy.
Should this decision prove a precedent for the future, then the uncertainty
and constraints which it introduces could undermine investment and wealth
creation.'
The 1,700 to lose their jobs at Sellafield are mechanical and electrical
engineers and skilled manual workers. They, and 600 others who lost their
jobs earlier this year, would have worked on Thorp for its first year of
operation. One thousand of the 1,700 will go by the end of next week.
Mr David Bonser, director of BNF's Thorp decision, rejected a claim
yesterday by Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, that BNF was
'holding a gun to the government's head' by announcing the job cuts. The
company had made very clear this would be the consequence of further delay,
he said.
But he revealed that BNF is to press the department again to allow it to
start live commissioning of Thorp, during the public consultation period,
using low-radioactivity uranium nitrate instead of spent oxide fuel rods.
The department had rejected a previous request. Mr Bonser said that if BNF
were given immediate permission to carry out uranium commissioning, 500 jobs
would be saved.
The latest job losses are a further blow to west Cumbria, which is
struggling to diversify its economy and stem a tide of job losses. One in
three of the local workforce depends on the nuclear industry.
Local unemployment, now 10.2 per cent, is expected by Copeland borough
council to touch 20 per cent this year because of the rundown of Thorp's
construction and the start of job shedding at Sellafield.
Thorp would employ 1,500 BNF workers. BNF said the delay in commissioning
was also preventing the creation of 1,000 contract jobs on allied
construction projects. The council expects 25 per cent unemployment if Thorp
is not allowed to start operating.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Major opposes News at Ten move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister yesterday put his weight behind growing opposition to
plans by the ITV companies to move News at Ten to the early evening.
In a letter to Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television
Commission, the industry watchdog, Mr John Major warned that switching the
bulletin to an earlier slot would seriously impair the authority of ITV's
news programming.
Number Ten's intervention, which means a full-scale political offensive is
under way to make the television companies change their mind, follows unease
among Labour and Tory politicians that the move would leave the BBC with an
effective monopoly of peak-time news coverage.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, yesterday released a letter he sent to the ITC
last week expressing concern at the move. He warned in his letter: 'If the
projected change were to take place it would mean that the fears about the
quality of independent broadcasting which the Labour party voiced during the
passage of the Broadcasting Act have proved totally justified.'
Downing Street emphasised yesterday that it was primarily concerned to
ensure that the provision of evening news programmes remained subject to a
competitive environment.
ITV wants to move the programme to 6.30pm or 7pm because present scheduling
complicates the televising of films and drama after the 9pm watershed.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Setback for Virgin's hopes of FM band
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson's hopes of getting an FM frequency for hisnational Virgin
Radio station faded yesterday, when the Radio Authority warned it would
block any such move.
Mr Branson, who launched Virgin Radio on AM at the end of April, has
proposed a frequency swap to the BBC. The corporation would get the Virgin
AM frequency, which would be suitable for speech, and Mr Branson hoped he
could get a BBC FM frequency.
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for
commercial radio, said yesterday that even if the BBC were to agree to such
a swap, he would find the idea 'totally unacceptable'.
The authority had advertised an AM frequency and higher bids might have come
forward if there had been any indication that an FM frequency might be
available.
Lord Chalfont added that if Mr Branson were able to winkle out FM
frequencies not being fully used by the BBC for commercial use, they would
be advertised.
This means that Virgin Radio will have to remain on AM at least until the
arrival of digital broadcasting later in the decade.
Lord Chalfont was speaking after the Radio Authority awarded a franchise for
the north-east of England.
The licence has gone to Radio North East, a consortium that includes Border
Television, the Carlisle-based ITV company. Radio North East, which plans
speech programming combined with easy-listening and country music, fought
off four rivals. The award was the third of five new regional commercial
stations.
Lord Chalfont also said yesterday that there were no plans to bring forward
the launch of the third national commercial station, which which will be
primarily speech-based. The new national franchise will be advertised
towards the end of this year and would go on air in 1995.
The Radio Authority said yesterday that new FM frequencies would become
available for commercial radio in 1996 - enough for a further national
channel or a greater number of stations if they were restricted to larger
towns.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Government aims to retain N-power option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is committed to retaining the option of nuclear power for
Britain, provided that the industry can operate economically and meet
rigorous standards of safety and environmental protection, Mr Tim Eggar, the
energy minister, said yesterday.
Speaking at a London conference organised by the UK nuclear power industry,
Mr Eggar pointed to some of the questions that will be addressed in the
review of the nuclear industry which the government plans to launch later
this year.
Mr Eggar said that a key question was whether new nuclear stations could be
commercially viable in the UK.
He said: 'The nuclear generators tell me that they can now build a new
nuclear station to come on stream in the early years of the next century,
which will produce power at a price competitive with that prevailing in the
electricity market, without any subsidy from government or taxpayer. The
review could test that ambition and examine the prospects for securing
private-sector involvement in the financing of new capacity.'
Mr Eggar said that other factors affect the competitiveness of nuclear
power, such as the environmental implications, security of supply benefits
and the need to maintain rigorous safety and environmental standards in the
industry.
The review would also look at the existing arrangements for covering the gap
between electricity prices in the market and nuclear's exceptional costs,
such as the nuclear levy.
Mr Eggar stressed that he had not yet made any final decision on the terms
of reference for the review.
The review is crucial to the future of the UK nuclear power industry, which
is at present in limbo with only one new station being built and several
stations reaching the end of their lives.
Mr Eggar has been urged to order a wide-ranging review so that nuclear power
is not judged solely on its economics and high costs.
Europe will witness a renewed interest in nuclear power by the end of this
decade, according to Mr Remy Carle, the chairman of the World Association of
Nuclear Operators.
Mr Carle, a deputy general manager of Electricite de France, told the
conference that many reactors will need to be replaced between 2000 and
2010, and work will have to begin in the 1990s.

FT  30 JUN 93 / EC move on works councils faces veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will use Britain's veto to block EC plans to introduce
mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies, Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, told MPs yesterday.
He said in his first parliamentary question time that such bodies would
'greatly damage' Europe's competitiveness. Britain wanted no return to
legislated co-operation between companies and workers.
Statutory works councils would mean 'going back to the bad old days of the
1960s and 1970s', he said. He called for all EC proposals to be tested on
the effect they had on Europe's competitiveness.
Britain insisted last month that plans for the councils should be taken off
the agenda for a meeting of labour and social affairs ministers, and hopes
its veto threat will head off any intention to press ahead with the
proposals during the Belgian presidency, starting in July.
Britain can block the directive under present EC procedures but once
Maastricht has been ratified and the social protocol takes effect, other
countries can introduce it.
Even though the UK has opted out of the social chapter British companies
could still be affected by the plans, as many have operations in continental
Europe large enough to require them to introduce the new procedures there.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Capital Radio agrees to restrict advert discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL RADIO has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to restrict giving
extra discounts to advertisers who promise exclusively to use either of its
two stations, Capital Gold, on the AM wavelength, or Capital FM.
The office informally began looking into Capital's advertising discounting
just over a year ago. Capital had been extending discounts of between 5 per
cent and 10 per cent to advertisers willing to enter an exclusive
arrangement, on top of the normal discounts - up to 20 per cent in Capital's
case - available for volume advertising.
In some campaigns marketing a new product, Capital's additional discounts
were as high as 50 per cent for an exclusive deal, and 25 per cent for a
deal which included just one other station besides Capital Radio.
Capital has now given assurances that such additional discounting will in
future be restricted to 'test campaigns' in which the advertisements are not
transmitted for more than two months out of a six-month 'campaign period'.
A minute of radio advertising time might cost as much as Pounds 7,000 on
London's commercial radio stations.
Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital Radio, said the practice of
discounting for volume sales - common across all media forms - is unaffected
by Capital's agreement. He added: 'But the OFT has thought that we are too
big a presence in the London radio market to be allowed to offer these extra
discounts.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROY WATTS, chairman of Thames Water, was frail, tired and thinking of
early retirement in the days before his death, an inquest heard yesterday.
Mr Michael Hoffman, group chief executive, told Poplar coroner's court, east
London, that Sir Roy, 67, had told him he was suffering from Parkinson's
disease some months before his body was found in the River Thames in London
on May 4.
At their last meeting, on April 21, Sir Roy had told him he 'might not go
full term'. He had taken that to mean 'that he was going to retire earlier
than we had discussed'. He added that Sir Roy had already said he planned to
leave his Pounds 160,000 a year job before April 1 next year as planned.
Dr Douglas Chambers, coroner, recorded an open verdict. He said no witness
had said Sir Roy had ever suggested taking his life.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Breakdown of pay talks with FBU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MIKE CANN, a representative of the fire brigades employers, and Mr Ken
Cameron, general secretary of the FBU firefighters' union, yesterday after
the breakdown of pay talks. The threat of a national firefighters strike
receded, however, after the union's leaders said they would consult with
members before any decision was taken on holding a strike ballot, Lisa Wood
writes. Employers' representatives told the union that the pay formula -
introduced to settle a nine-week national strike 15 years ago - would be
suspended in November because of the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling on
public-sector pay. But they said they would guarantee the formula's
re-instatement next year. The formula links earnings to the upper quartile
of full-time male manual workers' pay. The employers rejected a proposal by
the union to pay 1.5 per cent in November and then make a top-up to the
formula-linked award in April.
Mr Cameron said that after consultations with members a delegates'
conference would be held in the summer to decide whether to call a strike
ballot.

FT  30 JUN 93 / City set to defend terror measures
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Corporation of London
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the local authority for the City - is preparing for a long defence of its
controversial proposals for tough new anti-terrorist measures in the City.
The proposals, which include a ban on non-essential traffic, the
introduction of vehicle checkpoints and extra police surveillance, have been
greeted with discreet dismay by some Whitehall officials. They fear that
introducing Belfast-style measures in the wake of the Bishopsgate bombing in
April would present the IRA with a propaganda coup.
But Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, insisted yesterday that the corporation was intending to press
ahead with the proposals.
He has recently met officials from the Department of Transport and other
government departments to smooth out some misunderstandings.
Although he conceded that some middle-ranking officials had expressed their
opposition to the plans, he insisted that the cabinet was broadly supportive
of the anti-terrorist measures.
The corporation has submitted its proposals, which would probably require
legislation, to the Home Office and is expected to make an announcement
soon.
The Home Office yesterday said that the final decision rests with the
corporation, although it warned that it would be opposed to excessive
anti-terrorist measures.
'We do not want the IRA to get any more publicity or propaganda out of this.
We want to protect the citizens, but not with disproportionate measures,'
the Home Office said.
In spite of government pressure, the proposals appear to have strong
business support in the City, particularly from foreign banks who have
warned Mr Cassidy that without further anti-terrorist measures the City's
status as a financial centre could be badly undermined.
Representatives from the Corporation of London and City of London police
have met the Bank of England, Stock Exchange, National Westminster Bank,
Lloyd's, and other business institutions in recent weeks to draw up the
proposals.
Mr David Edmonds, general manager for group property at NatWest, said that
the banks were now pushing for a speedy discussion and decision on the range
of proposals.

THE European Investment Bank yesterday announced an Ecu65m (Pounds 52m) loan
to the Czech Republic to help modernise its telecommunications system.
The loan, which is to help finance projects to provide 500,000 new lines and
modernise existing infrastructure, brings to nearly Ecu330m the funds
committed by the EIB for the upgrading of telecommunications systems in
central and eastern Europe. The 15-year loan will finance nearly one-tenth
of the required expenditure.
The telecoms loan accounts for more than half of the EIB's lending to the
Czech Republic.
AP adds: The EIB yesterday said it would loan Dollars 230m to help fund the
first stage of a high-capacity, natural-gas line linking Algerian supplies
with the Spanish gas network and eventually EC countries.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: France takes tough line on G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday hardened its opposition to next week's Group of Seven
summit reaching anything except a procedural agreement on the future of the
Gatt trade talks.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said that Washington must first lift its
recently confirmed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel imports
from France and other countries if there was to be 'a successful conclusion
by the G7 on trade agreements'.
Elysee officials confirmed this was the position that President Mitterrand
would take to the Tokyo summit of the G7 industrialised nations.
The officials also said France saw no sense in the timing of the July 6
eve-of-summit 'quadilateral' meeting of US, EC, Japanese and Canadian
negotiators on market access issues.
'Either this will end in failure, getting the summit off to a bad start  -
or if there is progress, there will be no time for EC negotiators to report
back on the results to the EC Council of Ministers,' an official said. That
would leave France, the three other EC countries, and President Jacques
Delors of the European Commission without a mandate to approve anything of
substance. Since last year's controversial draft US-EC farm accord, Paris
has insisted that Commission negotiators commit the Community to nothing
without prior Council approval.
Mr Balladur yesterday announced he would not join Mr Mitterrand at the Tokyo
summit since he and the president had no disagreements on foreign policy,
'notably on Gatt'.
The apparent calm with which the conservative prime minister seems ready to
let the Socialist president lead a French delegation that will also include
Mr Balladur's foreign and economy ministers stems not only from the memory
of the protocol fracas that occurred when a previous conservative prime
minister - Mr Jacques Chirac - insisted on accompanying President Mitterrand
to a G7 summit in Tokyo seven years ago, but also from the knowledge that
the president is committed to a hardline Gatt stance.
French foreign minister Alain Juppe yesterday affirmed his team's tough
stance, and said there was no question of France accepting a deal on market
access or lowering tariff barriers at the summit.
Paris is incensed at what one senior official yesterday termed Washington's
'fork-tongued hypocrisy' in calling for both sides of the Atlantic to reduce
their steel tariffs to zero, while at the same time imposing 'unilateral and
discriminatory' penalties on steel imports into the US.
Usinor, the French state-controlled steel company, said it would stop
exporting FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) a year of flat-rolled steel to the US after
the Commerce Department said these would be hit by anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy duties.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia to buy Russian and US fighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE 18-month contest between the world's leading military aircraft
manufacturers ended yesterday with a decision by Malaysia to split its
purchase between Russia and the US.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, announced it would buy 18
MiG-29s and eight McDonnell Douglas F/A-18s. Details of the deal, thought to
be worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), have still to be negotiated.
He said the Russian jets would be paid for in 'cash and commodities' while
the US aircraft would be paid for in cash.
By opting for MiG-29s, Malaysia will become the first member of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to equip itself with Russian
aircraft. The other members are Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore and Brunei.
The contest, to replace ageing US-supplied F-5 fighters, was narrowed down
after Malaysia rejected the French Mirage 2000 and the Anglo-German-Italian
Tornado.
Also eliminated in the competition was the Lockheed F-16, the most
successful fighter in previous sales contests in the region.
Malaysia originally planned to buy a squadron of Tornados from the UK under
a 1988 accord but changed its mind two years later and bought British
Aerospace Hawk light fighter/trainers instead.
Russia reinforced its sales campaign by proposing to accept part-payment for
the MiG-29s in palm oil and other products. But the Royal Malaysian Air
Force voiced concern about Russia's ability to support the aircraft once in
service and is reported to have insisted on including at least some of the
multi-role F/A-18s. The only other country in the region with F/A-18s is
Australia.
Japan Air System, Japan's third biggest carrier formerly called Toa
Domestic, yesterday ordered seven Boeing 777 aircraft worth Dollars 820m,

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo learns art of diplomatic defiance

JAPAN is learning to say No to the US, in a new mood of assertiveness which
saw trade talks in Tokyo end in stalemate late on Monday.
The question is whether Tokyo can say more than that, and come up with its
own proposals to create a framework for further detailed trade talks with
the US.
This week's talks foundered on Japan's vehement opposition to targets for
cutting its current account surplus, which will be worth about Dollars 150bn
(Pounds 100bn) this year, and opening its markets to imports.
The US wants the surplus cut from about 3.5 per cent of gross national
product to between 1 and 2 per cent. It also wants Japan to increase by a
third its imports of manufactured goods and has proposed targets in five
areas, including government procurement, supercomputers and auto parts. In
return the US has pledged it will reduce its federal budget deficit and
block protectionist measures to exclude Japanese goods from the US.
In reply the Japanese said in private what they have been saying in public
for weeks: they will not agree to numerical targets on the grounds that this
would amount to managed trade.
Japan's opposition is unlikely to weaken, with one senior Japanese official
acknowledging a growing psychological need to resist US pressure.
Older bureaucrats and business leaders want to test the credibility of the
young Clinton administration, believing its resolve to pressure Japan will
flag. Younger officials believe it is their task to establish a more equal
relationship with the US, in which Japan stands up for itself.
The bureaucrats' approach is echoed in the business community. One top
executive with a leading Japanese publishing group sums up the mood: 'We
should say No because Mr Clinton simply does not know very much about
economics.' Yet when asked what Japan should do after resisting, he replied:
'That is up to the government.'
The problem is that Japan's new willingness to say No has not been matched
by a capacity to propose alternative approaches. This has been exacerbated
by the political turmoil created by the government's defeat in a
no-confidence motion two weeks ago.
Getting the Tokyo's hard-nosed bureaucrats to budge will become increasingly
difficult in the next few months, until a political leadership emerges after
the July 18 general election strong enough to deliver concessions.
At the very least the US administration will have to adjust its expectations
of how quickly it will be able to reach a deal, and its hopes of concluding
an agreement in time for next week's summit between President Bill Clinton
and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, have been dashed.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: 'A last chance' for the Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF 1992 was the year of lost opportunity, then 1993 may be the year of the
last chance to seal a trade-liberalising Uruguay Round deal, says Mr Arthur
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In the introduction to the annual Gatt Activities Report, published today,
Mr Dunkel warns that governments in the industrial world seem to be having
difficulty 'in comprehending what the word 'competition' really means.'
He complains that by espousing protectionist concepts such as trade
management and bilateral reciprocity, industrial countries are jeopardising
the gains of 45 years of trade liberalising work by the Gatt: 'Had Gatt
tried to expand world trade through such a philosophy, then the world would
now be a very much poorer place,' he says.
In a strong but coded assault on recent US demands for managed trade
solutions to its trading difficulties with Japan - a subject that will be
high on the agenda at the G7 summit - Mr Dunkel says in the Activities
Report industrial countries appear to have forgotten what trade really is,
and what makes it happen.
Trade, he says, is based on competition, which in turn is based on
difference: 'Differences in access to raw materials, in wage rates, in
labour conditions, in education, in publicly- or privately-funded research
and development, in exchange rates, in labour productivity, in investment,
in standards of health care and in industrial and commercial structures.'
Leaders and powerful lobbies in the US and France in particular have called
for such differences to be ironed out in defence of jobs at home.
The recently-liberalising countries of Latin America and eastern and central
Europe have had 'a disillusioning experience' in dealings with industrial
countries, who have hindered market access as fast as liberalising countries
have eased access to their own markets.

obstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, has found that the
corporate groupings known as 'keiretsu' sometimes obstruct competitors and
exclude potential partners, including foreign companies, in the glass, car
and paper industries.
In examining the so-called vertical keiretsu, which involve links (often
cross shareholdings) among manufacturers and their suppliers and
distributors, the FTC listed behaviour it said was inappropriate but not
necessarily in breach of anti-monopoly regulations.
The keiretsu have been targeted by the US government, which argues the
groupings are exclusive and limit business opportunities for foreign
companies. There are two types of keiretsu; the horizontal corporate
families, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, which cover a wide range of
industries, and the vertical, which focus on a specific industry.
FTC officials found that the links to sales agents of sheet glass companies,
car parts makers, and paper manufacturers had remained almost unchanged over
the past five years. Some restrictions were imposed on sales to companies
outside the keiretsu and special discounts were offered to keiretsu members.
The FTC findings confirm some US complaints about the closed character of
the keiretsu. However, the commission indicated it planned no punitive
action against the companies surveyed.

FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Director-general of unfinished business
reaches end of the line - David Dodwell talks to Gatt's head on eve of his
retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EIGHTEEN months ago a draft agreement
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
called the Dunkel Draft in deference to the role Mr Arthur Dunkel played in
crafting it - was drawn up in an attempt to break the deadlock in world
trade talks. Today, as Mr Dunkel steps down after 13 years as
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Dunkel
Draft is still unsigned.
In Geneva yesterday the head of the Geneva-based international trade
watchdog was more philosophical than disappointed about retiring before a
Uruguay Round accord has been reached: 'The political winds were never quite
right, never blowing in the same direction for everyone.'
As leaders from the Group of Seven industrial nations prepare to meet in
Tokyo next week, with differences over the need for trade liberalisation
high on the agenda, Mr Dunkel remains optimistic that agreement can be
reached: 'We have come to a phase of secret diplomacy. There are lots of
meetings taking place, and they are based on new ideas.'
Concern that deepening recession, in Europe in particular, provides a
deteriorating environment for settlement of the Uruguay Round are
nevertheless apparent. Mr Dunkel fears the resurgence of the 1930s claim
that protection is needed to protect jobs.
'We thought it was part of the common sense of everyone that in an
integrated world economy, one of the most important sources of jobs is
international trade,' he said yesterday. 'Governments need to remind
protectionists that a tax on imports is a tax on exports.'
Recent US demands for management of trade with Japan are a source of less
concern: 'We know the results of managed trade: just look at Comecon. Are we
really going to manage trade when we have such strong evidence that it does
not work?'
Mr Dunkel is ready to challenge any criticisms that at certain pivotal
moments - such as the negotiating collapses in December last year, or in
Brussels in December 1990 - he failed to manipulate negotiators to make the
final push that might have prevented breakdown.
'I may look peaceful, but some people have come to know that I can be very
rough,' he says, recalling secret sessions called with negotiators either at
his home in Roussin, north-west of Geneva, or in the back room of an Italian
restaurant close to the French border. 'In this process there has been a lot
of bulldozing, keeping the bar open until two in the morning - even physical
boxing.'
If the G7 summit is a success, with leading industrial countries agreeing a
market opening package of tariff cuts in manufactures and services, Mr
Dunkel's successor Mr Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner,
will be presiding within days of assuming office over a hectic push in
Geneva to broaden the G7 deal to embrace all 111 signatories to the Gatt. If
they fail, he faces the potential failure of the Round, and a slide into
protectionism and managed trade.
'I spent my youth in a family that went through the Great Depression,' Mr
Dunkel recalls. 'I have no need to read text books to remember what it was
like.
'That is what frightens me, because attitudes being voiced today are very
similar. The major difference today is that the Gatt exists, and is playing
a full roll as a deterrent.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Gloomy US figures send shares down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of gloomy economic statistics raised further questions yesterday
about the momentum of the US recovery and prompted a decline in share
prices, with the Dow Jones closing 11.35 points down at 3,518.85.
The biggest surprise was a 21 per cent drop in new home sales between April
and May, the largest monthly decline in more than a decade. Sales fell in
all regions except the west.
A slowdown was expected after an erratic 21.5 per cent rise between March
and April, but analysts had not expected the previous gain to be wiped out.
Sales in the first five months of this year are barely ahead of the same
period last year. Most forecasters had expected a big gain following falls
in mortgage rates to the lowest level in 20 years.
Separate figures for the consumer confidence index showed a three-point
decline this month to 58.9, the lowest since last October and sharply down
from a recent high of 76.7 in January.
In a strong recovery, the index would be expected to rise above 100.
The Conference Board, the New York-based business analysis group that
compiles the index, predicted the economy would remain weak. Its latest
survey of 5,000 households indicated consumers were less positive both about
prevailing economic conditions and in their expectations for the next six
months. Buying plans had been scaled down.
Some analysts believe the weakness of confidence is a reflection of
uncertainty caused by the bickering in Washington over President Bill
Clinton's deficit-cutting economic plan.
Sales of many items, such as cars, have held up better than consumer
confidence figures might suggest.
In a third sign of weakness, the Commerce Department yesterday reported a
0.3 per cent decline in the official index of leading economic indicators in
May, the third decline in five months.
The leading index is intended to predict economic conditions six to nine
months ahead but most analysts see it as a measure of the current economic
state.
Yesterday's reports, which follow news last week of the third consecutive
monthly decline in new orders for durable goods, are certain to raise fresh
doubts about the economic outlook.
Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, yesterday revised down its forecast for
second-quarter growth in GDP to an annual rate of 1.5-2 per cent.
The economy grew at an annual rate of only 0.7 per cent in the first
quarter.
The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy will regain strength
in the second half and growth is forecast at an annual rate of close to 3
per cent.
This assumes that low US interest rates will gradually encourage higher
spending by both consumers and companies, and that enactment of the Clinton
economic plan next month will end a damaging period of uncertainty about tax
policy.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Economist with political nous: Lawrence Summers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN POLITICS your job is as important as you make it. This, at any rate,
appears to be the modus operandi of Mr Lawrence Summers, the forceful
under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury.
Mr Summers is only the third-ranking official at the Treasury; yet this has
not stopped him speaking out authoritatively on a range of issues, some of
which would appear to be the responsibility of other departments.
For example, in a series of speeches - most recently to Japanese businessmen
in Tokyo - Mr Summers has set out the general principles underlying trade
relations between Japan and the US. Mr David Mulford, who held Mr Summers'
job in the Bush administration, tended to focus more narrowly on the
financial services sector and left general trade policy to the US trade
representative or the commerce secretary.
While many appointees of President Bill Clinton are still struggling to find
their feet, Mr Summers is rapidly carving out a position of influence. His
stature in part reflects his having served the perfect apprenticeship for
his job.
As chief economist at the World Bank for two years up to last November's
election, Mr Summers became familiar with nearly all the issues now
confronting him, such as economic reform in Russia, policy co-ordination
between Group of Seven countries and third world development.
He also had a chance to build personal relationships with leading economic
policy makers in Europe and Japan.
As most members of Mr Clinton's economic team have been fully absorbed with
domestic policy - especially the struggle to win congressional support for
the deficit-cutting economic package, Mr Summers has had a relatively free
hand to mould international policy.
He has been instrumental in shaping a two-pronged global strategy consisting
of a 're-invigorated multilateral effort' to strengthen global economic
growth and an 'export-activist' trade policy designed to open markets and
make other countries 'bear a greater responsibility for supporting the
global trading system'.
In both areas Mr Summers has tried to present policy in terms likely to
appeal to Washington's Group of Seven partners.
For example, he encouraged his boss Mr Lloyd Bentsen, to stress that
economic co-operation is a 'two-way street' in which the US will respect the
views of allies.
Viewed from Tokyo, Mr Summers' brand of co-operation looks more like
coercion: Tokyo is being pressed hard to adopt a more expansionary fiscal
policy and to halve its current account surplus as a fraction of national
income.
Mr Summers has been active on many other fronts. He is one of the
administration's strongest proponents of more generous US and international
support for Russian economic reforms and is also showing greater sensitivity
to the needs of developing countries than his Republican predecessors. He
has signalled that the US would join other industrialised countries in
offering more generous debt relief to low-income countries in sub-Saharan
Africa and elsewhere.
He is putting his inside knowledge of flaws in World Bank operational
procedures to good use by pressing it (and other development institutions)
to sharpen their focus on poverty relief and alter the way they conduct
business.

BELIZE holds a general election today with the ruling party trying to play
down concerns that the country's security is threatened by political
uncertainty in neighbouring Guatemala and a planned pull-out by British
forces.
The election was called by the prime minister, Mr George Price, 15 months
before it was constitutionally due. The election follows the removal from
office of Guatemalan president Mr Jorge Serrano, with whom Mr Price had
reached an accord - yet to be ratified - ending the 130-year-old Guatemalan
claim on Belize.
In a bid to calm fears over Guatemala's attitude to the agreement, Mr
Antonio Castellanos, ambassador to Belize, issued a statement at the weekend
saying that 'the new Guatemalan government will respect and honour all
international agreements.'
Mr Price's People's United Party is expected to retain a majority in the
assembly, but to be closely challenged by main opposition United Democratic
Party led by Mr Manuel Esquivel. The opposition accuses the government of
having no plans to defend the country following last month's British
decision to withdraw a 1,400-strong garrison.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, enjoying a boost in his approval ratings after the
weekend raid on Iraq, yesterday returned as promised to domestic affairs by
exhorting small businessmen to support his budget reduction and health care
programmes.
In a speech to a conference in Washington, he complimented elements in both
versions of the budget bill passed by Congress, particularly approving some
of the incentives for small business in the House measure but watered down
in the Senate.
The budget plan, he said, 'is great on deficit reduction. It does invest
some money in the future, but it doesn't invest anything like what you would
want us to invest if we weren't strung up by the heels by the deficit. And
there is no answer to it except to get health costs in line with inflation.'
Failure to accomplish this, he added, could 'break the country.'
He sympathised with small businessmen who were 'paying out the ears' for
health care insurance and invited them to 'join the debate' about the right
solution.
But he disclosed few details of the proposed blueprint being drawn by the
the task force under Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton.
This will not be unveiled until after Congress disposes of the budget and
possibly may not be made public until September.
A poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News yesterday confirmed not
only general backing for the raid on Iraq but also a lift in the president's
own previously sagging approval ratings.

FT  30 JUN 93 / US space station wins a reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US space station now appears likely to survive after efforts to cut off
money for the project failed in the House of Representatives late on Monday
night.
Congressional opponents of the space station failed last week by a single
vote to remove framework authorisation for the project, and had hoped that
Monday's vote on funding could turn their way.
In the end, intensive lobbying by the White House, which has thrown its
weight behind the redesigned station, produced a 220-196 margin of victory
in the funding vote, with half a dozen members switching to support the
station.
The new design for the space station, drafted in three months by a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration team, is expected to cost Dollars 2.1bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) a year over the next five years, with a further Dollars 5.5bn
required to bring it up to permanent occupancy by the end of the century.
The two House votes have been the closest shaves so far for the costly space
station project, on which Dollars 9bn has already been spent. The Senate is
expected to look more favourably on the space station, but Congress as a
whole has taken a new and more sceptical look at many expensive projects of
this sort.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Output down, joblessness up in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in Japan's industrial output last month and a marked rise in
unemployment have cast doubt on hopes that the Japanese economy is bottoming
out after its two-year decline.
Figures published yesterday suggest a pick-up in economic activity in the
first three months of this year may have been short-lived.
The downturn in industrial production last March was expected but, if it
continues this month, the Bank of Japan will come under increasing pressure
to cut official interest rates below their historical low of 2.5 per cent.
The Bank of Japan regards industrial production as one of the keys of the
economy's health. Industrial production in May fell 4 per cent from the same
month last year and 2.4 per cent from April, when it was down 2.5 per cent.
The falls in the last two months wipe out the slight increase in industrial
output in February and March, which were greeted as evidence that the
economy was starting to recover.
Most significantly, invent-ories rose 0.5 per cent in May after falling for
several months. The rise in inventories means production in June will be cut
in response.
The largest falls in industrial shipments were in transport equipment, down
8.4 per cent from April, general machinery, down 8.3 per cent, and precision
instruments, down 8 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said: 'The June
and July industrial production data will be vital for the Bank of Japan's
policy.'
Unemployment meanwhile rose 0.2 per cent last month to 2.5 per cent, the
highest level since 1988. Employment growth has virtually stagnated.
Employment rose by 0.2 per cent to 65.27m.
The ratio of job offers from companies to the number of people seeking jobs
fell to 0.81, the lowest level since November 1987. The ratio means that for
every 100 people seeking jobs there was just 81 job openings.
New job offers were 18 per cent down in May the year before.
A further shake-out of labour is almost certain as Japanese companies cut
costs to restore their profits. The proportion of Japanese companies
reporting they have a surplus of labour, exceeded those reporting a shortage
for the first time for six years according to a labour ministry survey. The
survey of 2,334 companies found that 18 per cent thought they had excess
labour while 16 per cent reported a shortage.

non-lethal military equipment, the State Department said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington.
When the embargo is officially lifted later this week the US will review all
applications to export defence equipment on a case-by-case basis.
A 1991 peace agreement imposed an embargo on both the Angolan MPLA
government and Unita rebels until the terms of the accord had been
fulfilled.
A US official said the embargo was being lifted as part of the normalisation
of relations with Angola.
Unita's representative to Washington, Mr Jardo Muekalia, objected to the
move, saying it would unfairly assist the MPLA government. 'Angola doesn't
need more weapons to solve its profound crisis,' he said.

MORE THAN 1,000 Algerians gathered yesterday at the tomb of Mr Mohammed
Boudiaf to commemorate the assassination of the former head of state a year
ago and protest at what they consider a whitewash in the official
explanation of his death.
At the government's behest, traffic across the country came to a respectful
halt during a moment of silence at 11.30am, the hour of his shooting in the
eastern town of Annaba.
However, crowds at the el-Alia cemetery turned the gathering into a
demonstration, waving banners calling on the government to tell 'the truth'
about the killing and chanting 'The assassins are in power'.
Postcards were distributed addressed to President Ali Kafi demanding a full
explanation of the assassination.
A commission of inquiry's verdict on the killing was that the assassination
was the act of one of his bodyguards, Mr Lembarek Boumarafi, who opened fire
on the 72-year-old leader while he was making a speech. Mr Boumarafi is
waiting trial.
Mr Boudiaf had returned to Algeria barely six months earlier from nearly 30
years of exile to lead his country, after the resignation of Mr Chadli
Bendjedid as president, and immediately gained popularity for his claims
that he would clean up corruption.
But yesterday's demonstration, and press comment this week, indicate that
few Algerians are satisfied. 'The explanations given have convinced no one,'
said an editorial yesterday in Liberte, the francophone daily.
The unease and suspicion have been heightened among Algeria's secular
intellectuals in recent months by a spate of other murders of prominent
scholars and writers in what appear to have been carefully planned
operations.

HIGH-LEVEL talks between the United Nations and Iraq will begin in New York
on July 7 aimed at resumption of limited Iraqi oil exports, it was announced
last night. The Sec-urity Council agreed in resolutions in August and
September 1991 to ease sanctions so Baghdad could export up to Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1.06bn) worth of oil. About Dollars 1bn of income would be earmarked
for humanitarian needs, with the rest going to pay UN costs since the Gulf
war, including destruction of Iraqi heavy weapons.
Several negotiating rounds between the two sides in New York and Vienna
failed with Iraq saying conditions imposed violated its sovereignty.
Russia has kept up high-level contacts with Iraq and is ready for economic
co-operation 'as soon as sanctions are lifted,' Mr Anatoly Adamishin, deputy
foreign minister, said yesterday, John Lloyd adds from Moscow.
Mr Adamishin, defending his country's support of the US attack on Baghdad
before the Russian parliament, said Moscow and Baghdad had mapped out
'specific future projects' although he declined to discuss them.
Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi echoed MPs' views, saying it was
regrettable that Russia was so swift to approve an action he branded as both
illegal and immoral, without consulting parliament.

THE US believes that Iraq's nuclear weapons programme has now been
'essentially destroyed', although President Saddam Hussein retains the
longer term ambition of rebuilding it with indigenous and foreign resources.
In testimony before Congress, Mr Robert Gallucci, the assistant secretary of
state for polito-military affairs, also conceded that US and other
intelligence agencies had significantly under-estimated the extent of the
Iraqi attempt to acquire offensive nuclear capability.
'It is clear in retrospect,' Mr Gallucci said, 'that they got it wrong and
that there were large elements of the Iraqi nuclear programme unknown to the
intelligence communities.'
He was confident the nuclear ambition was now 'out of business' as a result
of the efforts led by the International Atomic Energy Agency under UN
auspices. But he concurred with the recent judgment of Ambassador Rolf
Ekeus, the UN special commissioner on Iraq, that Baghdad's weapons
programmes would 'grow like mushrooms after rain' if UN sanctions against
Iraq were lifted.
Mr Gallucci said the US, as well as the IAEA, was aware of the identities of
foreign concerns that had supplied Iraq.
In southern Iraq yesterday, a US Air Force jet fired a missile at an Iraqi
anti-aircraft radar in the first such incident in the no-fly zones since
mid-April.
It was fired after the radar locked on to one of the two US jets in the
area, the US Defence Department said in Washington. A Pentagon spokesman
said there was no immediate information on whether the Harm missile had
destroyed the radar.
Iraq claimed the anti-aircraft battery near Basra was not activated and said
a soldier was wounded.
The attack followed Sunday's raid by US cruise missiles on intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for what Washington said was an
attempt by Iraq to kill former President George Bush.
US and other warplanes have been policing no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq to protect dissident Kurds in the north and Shia Moslems in
the south. French state radio said yesterday that a French engineer had been
jailed for eight years and a Moroccan colleague was missing after they
crossed into Iraq from Kuwait, Reuter reports from Paris.
According to relatives, the 25-year-old engineer, Mr Jean-Luc Barriere, and
his 29-year-old Moroccan colleague strayed into Iraq while driving in the
desert 10 days ago.

few Algerians are satisfied. 'The explanations given have convinced no one,'
said an editorial yesterday in Liberte, the francophone daily.
The unease and suspicion have been heightened among Algeria's secular
intellectuals in recent months by a spate of other murders of prominent
scholars and writers in what appear to have been carefully planned
operations.
The most recent victim, Mr Mohammed Boukhobza, a sociologist and head of the
National Institute for Global and Strategic Studies, was killed a last week,
his throat slit in his own home by four assailants in front of his family.
The killings are widely - though not universally - assumed to be the work of
Islamic extremists who have been involved in a bloody hit-and-run battle
with security forces since the 1991 elections were suspended. Since a state
of emergency was imposed in January 1992 at least 1,000 people have died in
political violence.
However, Mrs Fatiha Boudiaf claimed in a newspaper interview this week that
the killings of intellectuals were part of the 'same morbid plan' as the
conspiracy she claims lay behind her husband's death.

INDONESIA'S President Suharto yesterday accepted Japan's invitation to visit
Tokyo immediately before the summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrialised nations which starts a week today, thereby resolving a
possible diplomatic wrangle.
Indonesia had asked to attend the summit as head of the 108-member
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in order to present the views of developing
countries. The issue of Indonesia's attendance had been embarrassing G7
members, which were concerned to avoid setting a precedent.
As one G7 diplomat explained: 'We currently have a very sensible and
moderate chairman of NAM but we do not want ..in six years' time to be faced
with inviting Gadaffi of Libya.'
Mr Suharto will now visit Tokyo from July 4-6 and meet Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister. Japan has promised to include matters raised by
Indonesia on the summit agenda. President Suharto may also take up an
invitation to meet President Clinton and may meet other leaders.
Indonesia pledged to improve north-south dialogue when it took over the NAM
chairmanship last year. Items likely to be raised by Mr Suharto in Tokyo are
debt relief for the world's poorest nations and the effect of unstable
commodity prices on the export earnings of developing countries.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, last night
sought to take control of the Punjab, the country's most populous province
and an important industrial and agricultural region.
A resolution passed in a joint sitting of parliament asked the president to
impose direct federal rule in the province.
The move was seen as an attempt to head off potential opposition from within
the Punjab provincial assembly.
There were fears that the imposition of direct rule could cause the worst
setback to government-opposition relations since Mr Sharif's return to
office, and his efforts to begin negotiations with all his political rivals.
'These people have subverted the constitution,' said Ms Benazir Bhutto, the
opposition leader. Her People's Democratic Alliance said the government had
pushed through the resolution although there was no breakdown of the
provincial government, which would require federal rule. Opposition MPs
walked out before the final vote.
A joint report by the US-based Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights,
published today, says Indian security forces in Kashmir 'have systematically
violated international human rights and humanitarian law by summarily
executing detainees and killing civilians in reprisal attacks', Reuter
reports from New Delhi.
'Extra-judicial executions and disappearances in Kashmir number at least in
the hundreds,' said the report.
The rebellion in Kashmir, the only Moslem-majority region in mainly Hindu
India, flared in 1990. Moslem rebels want independence or merger with
Pakistan.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Preparing China for life without Deng: Moves to preserve the
legacy and the past of the ageing 'emperor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS inadvertent, but it was a reminder nevertheless of one man's
mortality and the great efforts to preserve his legacy as the moment of
reckoning approaches. The official China Daily newspaper, in an article
hailing the 'historic' contributions to the revolution made by Mr Deng
Xiaoping, referred to the ageing and ailing supreme leader in the past
tense.
Thus, Mr Deng 'was an outstanding representative and brilliant model of
safeguarding, adhering to and developing Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong
thought'.
It is unlikely that China Daily's grammatical faux pas would have been
brought to Mr Deng's attention; but as the old man's 89th birthday in August
approaches, so do efforts intensify to tidy up the historical record in the
certain knowledge that challenges lie ahead.
In the process of glorifying Mr Deng's theories - Mr Deng has 'theories'
while Mao had 'thoughts' - Chinese propagandists have excelled themselves,
using language reminiscent of another era. Thus, the official Shanghai
newspaper Wen Hui Bao told its readers the other day that 'practice had
shown that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is the most precious, spiritual
wealth of our party and country'.
It described Mr Deng as a 'glorious paragon', and said that he had 'made a
great, historical contribution to the establishment of the theory of
socialism with Chinese characteristics'.
Ever since Mr Deng's clever phrase designed to avoid conflict with socialist
orthodoxy was woven into the Communist party's constitution at its 14th
Congress last October, efforts have been accelerating to try to ensure that
the Deng legacy will endure and his heirs afforded some protection in a
difficult phase.
The Communist party itself faces enormous challenges, and perhaps a threat
to its very existence, in managing China's transition to a market economy.
In the process central control is being loosened in almost every way.
In the past few weeks efforts to promote Mr Deng's theories have built up to
something of a climax with a heavyweight symposium in Shanghai, accompanied
by blanket media coverage. Final editing is also well advanced of the
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 1983'92. The earlier selected works 1975-82
was published in 1983.
All this suggests that not only are Mr Deng and his supporters anxious to
impress their version of history on the party and the country while the old
man retains his faculties, it may also indicate that his health is indeed
deteriorating more quickly than has been admitted; although Chinese leaders
have long defied predictions of their imminent demise.
Mr Deng has been variously reported to be suffering from throat cancer,
which would explain his inability to utter more than a few and virtually
unintelligible hoarse sentences in public; from Parkinson's disease, hence
his unsteady hands; from the effects of a stroke which caused a bad fall
when he was visiting Shanghai in January; or simply from debilitating old
age complicated by heavy smoking.
Whatever the truth, it is clear he is not all that far from an appointment
with Karl Marx - his favourite euphemism for death - and has therefore
become more than usually preoccupied with how others might view his record.
Indeed, Mr Deng is said to have paid close attention to the editing of his
selected works and to have intervened to ensure that no mention was made of
his role in decisions which led to the 1989 massacre of students in
Tiananmen Square and other unfortunate episodes from the past.
Mr Deng is not about to arm revisionist historians with incriminating
material that might facilitate negative judgment of his record. The official
version of his theories, enshrined in numerous weighty volumes, including a
six-volume, 1.8m-word Almanac on Deng Xiaoping's Works, Thoughts and Life
published recently, guards against expected assaults on his reputation and
record.
But for the moment Mr Deng cannot complain. No hint of criticism has
appeared anywhere. A small publishing industry has been constructed to
ensure that volumes of his ideas fill libraries throughout the country with
titles such as Creativity and Timeliness of Deng Xiaoping's Theories; never
mind that the pragmatic Mr Deng has been a man of action rather than words.
Perhaps no other event in Mr Deng's recent past has received quite so much
attention as his nanxun, or 'imperial tour', of the south in January 1992 in
which he urged quicker economic reform with the phrase 'do it faster'. This
earthy instruction galvanised a nation and helped produce the astonishing
rates of economic growth witnessed in the past year. The nanxun may well
come to be regarded as his crowning achievement.
Mr Deng has said or written little publicly in the past few years, but when
he does speak, or has views attributed to him, it underlines his immense
preoccupation with the post-Deng era, and the danger of old controversies
and feuds resurfacing which might cause his legacy to unravel.
According to the Chinese-affiliated journal The Mirror, published in Hong
Kong, Mr Deng has urged his colleagues to avoid ideological conflict and to
concentrate their efforts on promoting economic reform.
'Whoever sows seeds of dissension over ideological matters will be shoved
aside,' he was quoted as saying. The problem for Mr Deng and his heir is
that this 'shoving aside' will prove infinitely more difficult to effect
from the grave.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government is under pressure to introduce new direct taxes
and broaden indirect taxation. An official report yesterday showed national
savings at the lowest level in 30 years and that the government needed to
raise ADollars 20bn (Pounds 8.6bn) a year in order to achieve its target
budget deficit of 1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996.
The report, commissioned by the federal government, found that national
savings stood at 16 per cent of GDP. The low savings level was due largely
to the public sector, with both federal and state governments running
greatly increased deficits in recent years.
Some new taxes that could be considered were inheritance and wealth taxes,
and widening capital gains tax to include family homes.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, is expected to use the report as
ammunition in next week's annual meeting with state premiers to prepare for
the federal budgets. State governments have been openly hostile to Mr
Dawkins' calls to further cut their spending and raise taxes.
Australia yesterday accepted a ADollars 45m compensation payment from
Britain for cleaning contaminated nuclear tests sites in South Australia
used by the UK in the 1950s, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister, and Mr Simon Crean, primary
industries minister, said details would be settled soon and Australia would
agree not to pursue further its claims relating to the test sites at
Maralinga and Emu.
The test sites were home to Aborigines. The Tjarutja Aborigines were granted
title to traditional lands inside Maralinga in 1984, before a scientific
team discovered the land was more contaminated than the British had
reported.
The Aborigines are now denied access to 1,200 square miles of their land
because of the contamination and are seeking compensation.

China should apply the death penalty more sparingly, end public executions,
and introduce further reforms to improve human rights, says the report of a
delegation to China last December led by Lord Howe, the former British
foreign secretary.
The delegation found evidence of continuing violations of human rights. Its
report calls for an 'urgent review of all summary forms of administrative
detention, with a view to their early abolition'.
It urges an end to the practice of holding elderly clergy in prison or
detention centres because their beliefs are 'repugnant' to the Chinese
authorities.
It calls for a reduction in the number of offences which carry the death
penalty and says prisoners should not be paraded before execution. Also, the
use of organs from executed prisoners for spare part surgery should stop, it
says.

<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday maintained pressure on the former Soviet
republic of Estonia when a senior official suggested that the 600,000-strong
Russian-speaking population would be 'pushed towards territorial
self-determination' if a law on aliens passed by the Estonian parliament
last week was not repealed.
Mr Sergei Stankevich, political adviser to the Russian president, said the
law on aliens 'creates in Estonia the pre-conditions for a mono-ethnic, or
single community, state'.
The law's key clause, which has upset the normally acquiescent
Russian-speaking community, lays down that all non-ethnic Estonians must
pass a language examination over the next year as a pre-condition for
continued residence.
Mr Stankevich's comments come as Estonia's north-eastern city of Narva,
where the population is 90 per cent Russian, is set to vote next month in a
local referendum on autonomy for the region. The issue has already been
referred to the Estonian Law Chancellor, the highest constitutional court in
the country.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has already threatened an
energy embargo if the law is not repealed or altered. In response, Mr
Lennart Meri, the Estonian president, has promised to refer the law for an
'expert opinion' to the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
Mr Stankevich was scornful of these moves and said the Estonian president
'has more than once spoken out in favour of the law on aliens'.
Russia is also in dispute with Latvia over what it views as 'the restriction
of vitally important rights and freedoms of a significant part of the
population of Latvia'.
Russian-speakers make up between 30 and 40 per cent of the Estonian
population of 1.6m and around 45 per cent of the Latvian population of 2.4m.
The row has halted the withdrawal of Russian troops from the two countries,
though Russia says no other sanctions have been taken. The cutting off of
gas supplies to Estonia was followed by a shut-down in the gas pipeline to
the third Baltic state of Lithuania, with which Russia has no quarrel - both
moves being blamed by the Russian gas industry on non-payment of debts.
However, late last night supplies to Estonia were restored.
The Nordic countries will attempt further to cool tension between Russia and
Estonia when a joint initiative is proposed to the regular meeting of the
Nordic Council tomorrow. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, told the
TT news agency yesterday that 'if nothing is done there is a risk the
conflict could escalate'.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Greek deal to buy Romanian fleet in doubt
</HEADLINE>

THE fate of a Dollars 335m (Pounds 223m) deal which would cede control of
Petromin, Romania's main shipping company, to a little-known Greek company
was in the balance yesterday after Romanian officials disagreed as to
whether the contract should be renegotiated.
The government reaffirmed its commitment to the deal under which Forum
Maritime, owned by Mr Stelios Katounis, would acquire 51 per cent of
Petromin in spite of a barrage of criticism from parliament, local business
and the press.
Under the existing contract, hailed as one of eastern Europe's largest
post-communist investments, Forum Maritime has until today to come up with a
downpayment of Dollars 100m in addition to the Dollars 25m it paid last
week. According to the contract, Forum has until 1997 to pay the remaining
Dollars 210m.
But the chamber of commerce in Constanta, where Petromin is based, said it
had begun legal proceedings to have the deal annulled in spite of the
government's position. It said that, under Romanian commercial law, at least
30 per cent of Forum's investment should have been paid when the joint
venture was signed.
Initially, the sale's opponents attacked the government primarily for
underselling Petromin to what the local press described as a relatively
obscure and small company.
Petromin owns 106 vessels totalling some 4.6m tonnes deadweight, around 75
per cent of Romania's merchant fleet. Its vessels are mainly used to
transport oil and raw materials, giving it a strategic significance.
Piraeus-based Forum Martime owns 12 bulk carriers, registered in Panama. It
is active in eastern Europe, shipping around 2m tonnes of grain to the
Commonwealth of Independent States annually, according to company officials.
The opponents' cause was strengthened by revelations on Monday that the
Romanian Development Agency (RDA), the country's investment watchdog, had
also opposed the deal as negotiated by Petromin and Forum.
According to a letter addressed to Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, the prime minister,
the RDA recommended that the contract be delayed until Petromin received
legal advice; Forum's payment period and investment plans had been
clarified; and Petromin had been independently evaluated.
Government sources in Bucharest said yesterday that Mr Ion Iliescu, the
former prime minister, and Mr Vacaroiu had been so anxious to pull off a
deal and to put Romania's foreign investments drive on the map that they had
overlooked the RDA's warnings.
So far, Romania has lagged behind central Europe's other former communist
countries in attracting western capital. Only Dollars 672m in direct foreign
investment had been committed by the end of May.
The controversy over the deal is a further blow to an already weak governing
coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic National Salvation Front.
Nationalist and ex-communist parties, upon which the minority government
relies, are threatening to withdraw their support if the prime minister
fails to explain his role in the affair.

FT  30 JUN 93 / UN resolution to rearm Moslems faces defeat
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A renewed attempt by Islamic states on the UN Security Council to lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems appeared headed for defeat last
night, despite US support.
Britain, France and Russia all opposed the resolution and Moscow threatened
to exercise its veto, if necessary, to block approval. However, that course
seemed unlikely because even the most optimistic of the sponsors questioned
whether the measure could command the required minimum of nine votes in
favour.
American backing for the text - drafted by Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti -
was obtained through the deletion of a paragraph authorising UN forces to
launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions. Opponents of
the resolution believe that rearming the Bosnian Moslems would serve only to
intensify and prolong the conflict that has defied all UN peacekeeping
efforts.
Britain and France, which between them have about 7,700 soldiers serving
with the UN in former Yugoslavia - mostly in Bosnia - are also concerned
that lifting the arms embargo or conducting air strikes would endanger their
own troops on the ground.
Given the resolution's almost certain fate, the sponsors drew comfort from
the prospect of a split in the ranks as the US reaffirmed its belief in
rearming Bosnian Moslems.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years after the Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and the
Catholic church led Poles to a sweeping victory over the ruling Communist
party, its former core trade union element has decided to test its support
by standing alone in national elections scheduled for September 19.
The decision, taken at a union congress in Zielona Gora in western Poland
over the weekend, is logical, given the political traditions of the union.
However, it could be a risky gamble, forcing the organisation back to a more
traditional union role.
At the moment the Solidarity Union MPs are riding high. It was their
no-confidence motion which led to the government's defeat last month and the
calling of elections.
But the result could provide a rude awakening to the movement if it fails to
garner 5 per cent of the national vote required to enter parliament.
Such an outcome would be greeted with relief by some union veterans like Mr
Jozef Polkowski at the Belchatow brown coal mine who is happy to support the
congress decision. 'If we win, good, we get into parliament and can defend
our members there,' he says. 'And if we lose, all the better because then
we'll become an effective trade union.'
That sums up a trade union movement whose instincts have always been
political. The union grew into a 10m-strong national movement which was
forced undergound by martial law. It re-emerged in 1989 to fight and win the
first semi-free election in June 1989. Shortly after assuming power, the
stress of pushing through harsh economic reforms soon revealed the internal
divisions which broke up the national movement into a myriad political
parties, including the Solidarity Union.
But the trade union has been weakened as many top advisers and leaders have
drifted to other parties.
The list includes Solidarity's former leader, now President Lech Walesa,
whose election campaign the union backed in 1990 but with whom it has now
split. By voting to stand alone in the elections, delegates at the congress
showed they wanted nothing to do with Mr Walesa's 'non-party bloc for
supporting reform'. The bloc is being organised by the president to
strengthen his influence in parliament. It can be expected to do well in the
election. But, in a fit of pique, Mr Walesa, who had expected to win over
the delegates, refused to address the congress once he had read the hostile
signals.
If Solidarity is to have a future as a union it will have to take more
notice of officials like Mr Andrzej Kaminski who works at the Wedel
chocolate factory in Warsaw, now controlled by PepsiCo of the US.
Mr Kaminski led the 400 unionists at the 2,000-worker plant through the 1991
transition to the private sector. He is less than complimentary about the
support he received from union leaders during a year-long struggle,
completed this week, to get what he calls a 'decent' pay deal.
'Solidarity will have to become more professional if it is to deal with
situations like mine where I have to get such commitments honoured,' Mr
Kaminski says.
In his view the current focus on electoral politics is really a sign that
union leaders have yet to come to terms with the need to build a modern
union capable of operating in a privatised economy where politics is less
important than performance.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Bosnian presidency ends divisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S collective presidency agreed yesterday to work together on a new
proposal for the future of the divided republic.
A statement issued after a two-hour meeting of the multi-ethnic presidency
said three of its nine members - a Moslem, a Serb and a Croat - would draw
up a new document on constitutional arrangements for the republic.
'It has been decided that the presidency is going to work on a collective
basis and with all members present,' the statement added.
Yesterday's meeting in Sarajevo was the first time that some of the seven
members of the collective presidency had visited the besieged Bosnian
capital since the war erupted 15 months ago.
Mr Fikret Abdic, a challenger to President Alija Izetbegovic, and who is
from the isolated north-western Moslem heartland, attended the Sarajevo
meeting despite an earlier statements that he feared assassination. Mr Abdic
last week broke ranks with the other Moslem representatives to the
presidency, saying he would consider any agreement which would end the
bloodshed in Bosnia. Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Ejup Ganic, the vice-president,
have boycotted the Geneva talks on the republic's partition, saying such a
move would be tantamount to collective suicide for the Moslems.
They fear the carve-up, backed by Serb and Croat nationalists, would leave
the Moslems without a state. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
has repeatedly threatened that if the Moslems refuse to support partition,
they will be forced to accept a two-way division between the Serbs and the
Croats.
The other presidency members appear divided over whether to accept the
partition of Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states or continue to fight to
preserve the war-torn republic as a unified state.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediator, yesterday arrived in
Zagreb, the Croatian capital, to meet UN officials and wait for the return
of some of the presidency members. Western diplomats say international
mediators are frustrated by Mr Izetbegovic's intransigence and his apparent
hope that the international community will finally turn around and rearm
Bosnia's Moslems.
Lord Owen, the other mediator, has vowed to work for a viable Moslem state
if all three parties agree to partition. But the pattern of recent fighting
makes it clear that both Serb and Croat troops intend to leave the Moslems
in scattered, unconnected ethnic enclaves. This strengthens the view of many
Moslems that it will be impossible to draw a border through the middle of
Bosnia without confining them to landlocked ghettoes.
In apparent confirmation of Moslem fears, Sarajevo radio yesterday reported
that 25,000 tonnes of emergency food aid has been stuck in UN warehouses at
Croatia's Dalmatian coast. The further blockade and continued fighting along
key supply routes appears likely to spur the mainly Moslem army to fight for
control of the roads leading out of central Bosnia.
The Sarajevo meeting was held as Serb and Croat forces closed in on the
Moslem stronghold of Maglaj in northern Bosnia.

TEAMS OF nuclear experts have started long-term safety work at eight
civilian plants in Russia and Ukraine, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's external
economic relations commissioner, announced yesterday.
The European engineers and scientists would remain on site for periods of up
to 12 months at six high-risk plants in Russia and two in Ukraine, he said.
'I believe we have broken the ice in our relations with the nuclear
establishment in Russia and Ukraine.'
The engineers will work on improving fire-fighting, emergency power supply
and cooling systems at plants in Balakovo, Beloyarsk, Kola, Kalinin,
Smolensk, and Sosnovy Bor in Russia, as well as Rovno and south Ukraine.
The European Commission has agreed to allow its consultants to contract
'substantial' work to specialised Russian companies and institutes.
The EC is committed to spending Ecu333m (Pounds 262m) for making older
Soviet-built reactors safe. Total earmarked EC aid, including member states'
contributions, is Ecu432m.
The dispatch of private sector experts follows a bilateral deal on legal
indemnity in the event of accident. Russia and Ukraine have agreed to accept
liability on condition the Europeans do not make basic changes in plant
operation or equipment.

FT  30 JUN 93 / IG Metall to take strong line on share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS in IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, are to be banned from
owning shares in German companies on whose supervisory boards they sit.
The action is an attempt to reassure members following the scandal in which
Mr Franz Steinkuhler was forced to resign as leader for alleged insider
dealing in shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company.
However the union's full-time executives have deliberately not agreed to
instruct their members to sign in-house company codes of conduct, designed
to counter insider dealing.
Germany has no law forbidding insider dealing, although a draft is being
prepared by the Finance Ministry in Bonn.
'We are making our own insider rules,' said Mr Klaus Zwickel, the man
nominated to take over the union leadership.
'We don't need any which the employers make. The people whom we propose to
become members of supervisory boards should be responsible to our members,
and not to the employers.'
The new rule was agreed by the full-time union executive of the engineering
workers' union on Monday and will be submitted for formal approval by the
full national executive, which meets in two weeks' time.
It reflects the puritan instincts of Mr Zwickel himself, previously Mr
Steinkuhler's deputy. He owns no shares in either BMW or Mannesmann, on
whose supervisory boards he sits under Germany's system of worker
participation.
It has not been decided how long union officials will have until they must
sell their shares. The one exception will be shares issued under
employee-participation schemes to those worker representatives on
supervisory boards who are also employees.
'We have nothing against such shares,' a union spokesman said. 'They are
often issued subject to special conditions, and cannot be openly traded.'
With its decision, the union leadership clearly hopes to distance itself
from the taint of scandal associated with Mr Steinkuhler.
He resigned last month after it was revealed that he had bought shares worth
DM1m (Pounds 400m) in MAH, the holding company set up by Daimler, on whose
supervisory board he sits. Shortly afterwards, the board decided to exchange
MAH shares for full Daimler shares, causing a sharp rise in their stock
exchange price.

FT  30 JUN 93 / D-Mark 'still anchor of ERM'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark's role as 'the anchor' of the European exchange rate mechanism is
not endangered despite its recent weakness, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, said last night.
Speaking at a dinner in Frankfurt, Mr Schlesinger said that there was no
question of the D-Mark losing its central role in the ERM despite the fact
that other countries have recently been enabled to lower interest rates
below German levels for the first time in decades. Last Monday, for example,
the French cut rates below German levels for the first time in 26 years.
'Occupying the role of anchor does not mean that our interest rates must
necessarily be the lowest (in the ERM),' he said. 'Other countries may have
higher or lower interest rates.'
He argued that more important for the D-Mark's status as anchor of the
system was that it retained its position as 'reference point' for other
currencies - and that it remained the most important reserve currency for
other European countries. He pointed out that 75 per cent of transactions in
ERM currencies last year were in the D-Mark.
Other currencies, notably the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder, had the
necessary credibility to act as co-anchor to the system. As for the French
franc, he said: 'It was on the way (to gaining that credibility) if it had
not reached it already.'
His remarks, coupled with the traditional assertion that the Bundesbank
would do its utmost to preserve the value of the D-Mark, will be scrutinised
by currency traders today ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the German central
bank's policy-making council in Leipzig.
Opinions are divided about the likelihood of a cut in the discount rate,
against a background of a D-Mark weakening against the dollar and the yen,
as well as European currencies. Analysts expect the discount rate to come
down from its current level of 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent by the end of
July at the very latest.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S parliament yesterday met for the first time since thegeneral
election earlier this month, re-electing the speaker and paving the way for
Mr Felipe Gonzalez to be sworn in for a fourth term as premier.
King Juan Carlos now begins formal consultations with party political
leaders and is expected to inform the speaker next week of his candidate for
prime minister - certain to be Mr Gonzalez.
Mr Gonzalez, whose Socialist party lacks a parliamentary majority, said he
might include the PNV, the small Basque nationalist party, in the government
and that he still hoped to persuade the more reluctant Catalan nationalists
of the larger CiU party to become junior partners in a coalition
administration.
An investiture debate, in which Mr Gonzalez would seek a vote of confidence,
could be held as early as Thursday next week and the new government
announced shortly after.
The need for a broad-based government has been heightened by a back-bench
revolt among Socialist MPs against Mr Gonzalez' nomination of Mr Carlos
Solchaga as the party's parliamentary leader.
Mr Solchaga, widely distrusted by the party's left wing and the unions,
secured the nomination by 87 votes to 66 with six abstentions. Spokesmen for
the rebel group said, however, they would respect the majority decision and
pledged loyalty to Mr Solchaga.
The Catalan politicians are understood to be under considerable pressure
from Barcelona business leaders to overturn their refusal to back Mr
Gonzalez. CiU support would ensure a stable government and its
business-orientated policies would reassure the markets.

FT  30 JUN 93 / France threatens waste import ban: EC engulfed by row over
flood of German packaging for recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday threatened to curb imports of German packaging waste
flooding into the country for recycling, as a result of Germany's ambitious
recycling legislation.
The warning came as European Community environment ministers discussed the
Commission's stalled packaging directive, which nearly all want to see
passed into law quickly to avoid the market distortions states like Germany
are creating by going it alone.
France, Britain, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg all
complain that their own infant recycling industries for plastics, paper and
board are being stifled under the weight of German waste exports, which are
often subsidised.
Germany does not have the capacity to process the amounts of packaging its
laws require to be recycled.
Mr Michel Barnier, the French environment minister, said an EC-wide solution
to waste flows was urgently needed. But if, within 'a few weeks', Bonn could
not reach a bilateral solution with Paris, the situation 'could require
import authorisations for these products'.
Officials from several member states expressed anger yesterday at the slow
progress of the EC packaging directive, to which the outgoing Danish
presidency has devoted only a half-day's working group in the last six
months. The acrimony over waste was compounded by the continuing row over
the proposed EC energy tax, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
On Monday night the UK accused the Danish presidency of 'a cack-handed
ambush' intended to isolate Britain by getting its 11 partners to agree that
the tax is a precondition for the EC to ratify the Rio climate change
convention, due by December.
At German and Dutch insistence, agreement on ratification - originally due
to go through on the nod - was taken off yesterday's agenda. Ms Magda de
Galan, environment minister of Belgium which takes over the EC presidency
tomorrow, said she would insist on maintaining the link between the tax and
ratification of Rio.
These three countries, along with Italy, Denmark and Luxembourg, in effect
signed up to the energy tax in March by declaring that the EC's Rio
commitments - to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 -
were not possible without it. The other six, led by the UK and France,
deplored what could now be a long delay in ratification.
Ministers nevertheless managed to agree:
to ratify the Rio convention on preserving biological diversity;
a directive cutting emissions such as sulphur dioxide through cleaner
burning of industrial waste, requiring the upgrading of incineration
facilities, over three years probably starting in 1996;
the Commission also launched the eco-label agreed by the 12 in 1991,
starting with dishwashers and washing machines, which can win this
environment-friendly certificate if they conform to a tight
'cradle-to-grave' assessment of energy and water consumption, air and water
emissions, solid waste and disposability.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY intends to introduce legislation to allow domestic and industrial
waste to be incinerated if recycling is too costly, according to Mr Thomas
Rummler, a director responsible for waste disposal at the environment
ministry, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. At present there are severe
restrictions on incineration. Mr Rummler said new legislation would foresee
the construction of incineration plants.
He was speaking at a conference on waste management jointly organised by the
Financial Times and the Boston Consulting Group.
Germany's environmental policies have recently been under renewed attack
from leading industrial lobbies. They are complaining that waste disposal
laws place an unfair burden on businesses struggling against recession and
intense foreign competition.
Germany has some of the strictest environmental laws in Europe, insisting
that products must be recycled if possible. There is also a draft bill which
would force manufacturers to take back durable consumer goods like
electronic and white goods and recycle the materials.
Industrialists at the conference raised questions on the validity of the
German approach to 'recycle at all costs'. Computer manufacturers, for
example, argue that energy recovery, such as burning plastics and using the
resulting heat for cement kilns, is a viable alternative to recycling.
France, Denmark and Belgium are currently using such incineration methods.

FT  30 JUN 93 / French Privatisation: French to cut public health spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled a plan to cut FFr32.2bn (Pounds
3.84bn) in public health spending over the next 18 months in a move to curb
the recession-swollen budget deficit, writes David Buchan.
The health cuts, which will mainly take effect next year, take the form of
lower reimbursement by the state social security system of the costs of
visits to doctors and of prescribed medicines, as well as an increase to
FFr55 (Pounds 6.56) of the flat fee for treatment in a hospital.
However, the chronically ill will not pay the higher charges.
France spends more on health - around FFr10,000 per inhabitant in 1990  -
than any other European country, with about 75 per cent of this being funded
by the state, either from the budget or from contributions levied on
workers' salaries.

FT  30 JUN 93 / French Privatisation: Sell-off generates FFr360bn in shares
 -The question is whether market can absorb them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the next few weeks the bureaucrats at the Economy Ministry in Bercy, to
the east of Paris, will put the finishing touches to legislation that will
enable the French government to launch one of the most ambitious
privatisation programmes seen in Europe.
The arrival of as many as 21 new companies will in the long term be
beneficial to the Paris stock market which, like other continental European
markets, has long suffered from a shortage of equity. But in the short term
the critical question for the Bercy bureaucrats is whether the French market
can absorb up to FFr360bn (Pounds 43bn) of new shares.
At first glance the market's condition is scarcely encouraging. It was
virtually static in 1992 and the CAC 40 Index has risen by a meagre 6.4 per
cent to 1,977 since the beginning of the year. The French economy is
technically in recession.
Almost all the market's growth has come in the few weeks since Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, unveiled his privatisation plans. The Paris
market is traditionally strongest in the final quarter of the year, which
means it should start its seasonal rally with the first new issues in
September.
French companies should by then be benefiting from the recent falls in
interest rates. James Capel expects the average net income of the CAC 40
companies to fall by 6 per cent in 1993 but to rise by 20 per cent in 1994.
It also expects the CAC 40 Index to reach a record 2,150 by the end of this
year.
However, the scale of the proposed sales means the government will have to
attract new money to the French market. The state's dominance of pensions
and savings means that France, unlike the UK, does not have a battalion of
domestic institutions to support privatisations. The success of the issues
rests on the government's ability to attract investment from foreign
institutions and French individuals, as it did in the last privatisation
drive in the mid-1980s.
This time it might be more difficult to mobilise foreign investment. The
French issues are part of a Dollars 100bn privatisation programme across
Europe and face stiff competition from share sales in Spain, Italy and the
UK. Moreover international investors already have substantial holdings in
France, which accounts for 23 per cent of the value of continental European
equities but represents 26 per cent of a typical continental portfolio,
according to Warburg Securities. They might be reluctant to increase them at
a time when the franc is so strong.
'Foreign investors will certainly be interested in French privatisations,'
said Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris.
'But it remains to be seen whether they will bring additional funds into
France, or simply switch money from existing French holdings.'
This suggests that the government will have to make special efforts to
attract individual investors. Fewer than 11 per cent of the French own
shares. The number of individual investors doubled during privatisations in
the 1980s, but the 1987 stock market crash curbed the Gallic appetite for
equities.
A quarter of French individual investors only own shares in one company and
more than half of all portfolios are worth less than FFr50,000. The number
of individual investors has fallen from 5.5m to 4.5m in the past 18 months.
A recent opinion poll suggested that the French are still ambivalent about
equities, with 78 per cent saying they had no interest in subscribing to the
forthcoming privatisations.
However, recent reductions in French interest rates should make equities
more appealing, encouraging savers to switch cash out of their
once-lucrative SICAV money market funds. Investors have already transfered
part of the FFr1,300bn placed in SICAVs to bonds. Analysts expect them soon
to turn from bonds to shares.
The government is doing its best to accelerate this trend. Mr Alphandery's
team has devised a series of tax breaks and incentives to persuade savers to
move money out of SICAVs into the FFr40bn Balladur bond launched last week
as a precursor to buying privatisation shares. Another round of incentives
will accompany the privatisation programme.
'There is so much money tied up in SICAVs that only a tiny proportion needs
to be withdrawn for the privatisations to succeed,' said Mr Joe Hall, head
of European equities at Warburg Securities. 'There is absolutely no reason
why it should not be able to absorb the new issues  - providing the price is
right.'

FT  30 JUN 93 / Feathers fly over shooting of wild birds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'LOOK at the little starling, it's oh so cheerful' runs a popular children's
song in Denmark. So popular, it would seem, that it induced the Danish
delegation at this week's European Community environment council to try to
sabotage a Danish EC presidency compromise on rules for shooting wild birds.
The latest twist in the 15-year-long tale of the Community's efforts to
legislate for the birds has arisen because the Danes regard the starling
sturnum unicolor (as opposed to the sturnum vulgaris) as a prized songbird.
Spain and Portugal want to be allowed to shoot starlings as a pest, but the
Danes do not believe Spanish claims about their hunters' ability to
distinguish between the vulgar and the unicolour. Britain, usually in the
vanguard of birds' rights, reckons the starling actually kills other more
prized songbirds.
More feathers flew over whether hunters in southern Italy could shoot the
black-tailed and bar-tailed godwit, because they can be confused with
curlews - which, it was pointed out, the fastidious Danes are allowed to
kill.
The environment ministers were attempting to amend the 1979 birds directive,
to make it possible to shoot pest birds like crows, jays, magpies, jackdaws
and rooks (except in the mating season). But it was not immediately clear
how much of the discussion was intelligible to those conducting it.
As one EC official opined: 'Magpies are stuffed either way.' Another, from
the UK, held to loftier philosophical ground, underlining that 'the problem
on pest species would not be negotiated in this way now, in the light of
subsidiarity'. That is to say. . . . if the legal mess had not been made at
EC level in the first place by member states now clamouring for Brussels to
mind its own business.
Yet in its original proposal, the European Commission specifically said that
pest species could, and even should, be shot. But it was argued down by a
bird-lovers' coalition led by Britain. This opened the way to prolonged
court actions against nearly all member states, where they continued to be
shot anyway.
As the Danes retired yesterday to ponder the fate of the starling, one
French official grandly trumped their popular songs about starlings by
pointing out that the poet Charles Baudelaire had written a famous poem
about the albatross. That fabled bird, he asserted, was closely related to
the gulls, cormorants and white-fronted goose which Danes can take pot-shots
at, but to which the French are very attached.
'It is unthinkable for us to shoot seagulls,' he fulminated. But it looked
more an attempt to ruffle a few more feathers.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Vigilante tactics forced on shops, says Dixons chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH shopkeepers have been forced to adopt vigilante tactics to stem a
rising tide of property crime, according to Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of
the Dixons Group, the UK's largest electrical retailing chain.
Mr Kalms told a conference held yesterday by the Social Market Foundation,
an independent think-tank, that Dixons had turned its stores into 'heavily
built fortresses' and employed a private security army to fend off thefts,
hijackings and ram-raider attacks which had cost the group Pounds 20m last
year.
He said Dixons had taken action to deal with squatters who moved into empty
stores and used them to sell stolen goods. Since the law appeared to have no
answer to shop squatting: 'We send the heavies in early in the morning and
turf them out,' he said.
The group's losses would have been much higher but for preventive measures
taken which blocked eight out of nine attempted break-ins. Yet Dixons alone
recorded more than 10,000 incidents of theft, violence and fraud last year.
On the day after the government published a white paper on reorganising
Britain's police, Mr Kalms said the police had increasingly become 'only a
data-collecting agency'. Although police resources had risen, the increase
did not match the explosion in crime. 'The police are no longer a force for
detection and prosecution of crime against property,' he said.
With all the high street stores building their own security forces, it was
inevitable that they would group together. Although it would be opposed by
the police, they should be given 'some sort of semi-official status', Mr
Kalms said. 'To avoid emotive discussion, we need to legitimise the meaning
of vigilantism.'
Mr Kalms said the lawmakers had not reacted quickly to new types of crime
such as ram-raiding and the use of car-boot sales to dispose of stolen
property.
Squatter shops had moved into empty high street property to sell stolen
goods without paying rent, rates or value added tax. Free of overheads,
trading regulations and health and safety standards, they undercut
legitimate stores such as Dixons.
Mr Kalms called for an independent commission to focus on crime 'with rights
to monitor, investigate and instigate' law changes using a 'fast track'
procedure. He also wanted more safety zones in shopping centres, which would
be closed to traffic at night and have bollards to stop ram-raiding.

FT  30 JUN 93 / IBM UK plans 'perform-or-else' sales shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK sales operations of International Business Machines, the troubled US
computer manufacturer, are to be divided into 30 separate businesses as part
of a far-reaching scheme to restore the company to profitability.
IBM UK is also considering compulsory redundancies, hitherto unthinkable in
the group's culture of high job security. It also intends by the end of this
year to reduce headquarters staff to 100 from 2,500 in 1991.
Under the plan, codenamed 'Galaxy', each business will be responsible for
determining its own prices and costs and will be answerable to head office
for its performance. Businesses that fall short of agreed targets face
closure or radical restructuring.
''Perform or else' is a good way of putting it,' said Mr Javaid Aziz, IBM's
marketing manager for the UK. The plan, developed over the past six months,
has the approval of Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief
executive.
The businesses will deal with specific industries or specific products such
as mainframes, or personal computers or computer services. IBM's
manufacturing operations in Europe are already on a similar footing. The
disk drive plant at Havant, Hampshire, faces closure if it fails to make a
satisfactory profit this year.
The reorganisation, the most profound that any IBM subsidiary has attempted,
was presented to Mr Gerstner when he visited Britain at the end of April by
Mr Aziz and Mr Nick Temple, IBM UK general manager. IBM UK lost Pounds 616m
on sales of Pounds 3.75bn last year. Details of the plan have been outlined
to IBM's top 60 managers over the past few days. As it takes effect, staff
numbers in marketing and sales are likely to fall to about 6,000 by the
third quarter of this year, compared with 10,500 at the beginning of 1991.
Some of the surplus headquarters staff will be employed in the new business
units. Others have left the company already or will do so by next Monday. Mr
Aziz said the plan would not involve more job cuts than already announced.
The UK operation is, however, under pressure to complete cuts in the size of
its total workforce swiftly. Overall staff numbers will have been cut by 40
per cent by the end of the summer, from a peak of about 18,600 in 1985 to
just over 11,000. Monday is the deadline for staff to accept the latest of a
series of voluntary severance packages. If the final 600 jobs cannot be lost
voluntarily, staff will be told that job losses might be compulsory. They
would be the first enforced staff cuts in Europe. The company has made more
than 2,000 compulsory redundancies this year in the US.
IBM UK is to double its graduate intake to 100 this year, although all new
trainees will be on four-year contracts.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Mates accuses fraud office of undermining Nadir defence:
Attorney-general rules out independent inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, last night ruled out an
independent inquiry into the Serious Fraud Office after rejecting a series
of sensational charges from Mr Michael Mates about its handling of the case
against Mr Asil Nadir.
In a resignation speech which alternately captivated and perplexed MPs and
prompted angry interruptions from the Speaker, Mr Mates accused the SFO of a
campaign to undermine the defence of the fugitive Turkish Cypriot
businessmen.
Mr Mates, speaking five days after his enforced resignation as Northern
Ireland minister because of his connections with the head of the Polly Peck
empire, said the SFO had sought to put 'improper pressure' on the judge
hearing the case.
It had also tried to engineer through judicious leaks a 'trial by media' of
Mr Nadir, he said. It had further colluded illegally with the Inland Revenue
and had misused privileged legal documents.
Mr Mates's detailed exposition of his own involvement in the case brought
several stern warnings from Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, that he
risked prejudicing any future trial if Mr Nadir returned to Britain from
northern Cyprus.
Mr Mates's main charges were immediately rejected by Sir Nicholas.
He said his office had 'carefully and dispassionately' investigated
allegations made by the former minister since he took up the case in 1991.
Some had proved to have no substance. Others had contained some 'underlying
facts' but his office had satisfied itself that in such cases there was a
'reasonable explanation'. In those circumstances, he saw no reason for an
inquiry.
Sir Nicholas was last night considering whether publication of his extensive
correspondence with Mr Mates would prejudice any future trial.
He was also preparing for the possibility later today of a statement in the
House of Commons. But it was made clear that his previous rebuttals had
covered all the substantive points made by Mr Mates in the Commons.
His office said: 'If Mr Mates's statement is found to raise any new points,
these will also be carefully and dispassionately examined. The
attorney-general is considering how far it is appropriate for him to make
further comment in the light of the continuing court proceedings.'
Mr George Staple, director of the SFO, denied last night that any of his
officers had acted improperly. He said: 'The director of the Serious Fraud
Office categorically denies any impropriety in the conduct of the SFO
investigation of Asil Nadir and his subsequent prosecution.'
Mr Mates's allegations brought a mixed response from MPs. Labour called for
a statement by the attorney-general, but refused to back Mr Mates's call for
an inquiry.
Some Conservative MPs said his allegations deserved investigation but others
privately accused the former minister of too readily accepting the case of a
fugitive from justice.
Mr Mates said he made no judgment as to whether Mr Nadir was guilty or
innocent of thecharges he faced. He said he had done nothing wrong in
presenting the evidence to the attorney-general and that he had no criticism
to make of the government.
The former minister said the SFO's handling of the case hadbeen
characterised from the outset by an attempt to undermine Mr Nadir's
credibility by leaking in advance details of its raids at the offices of
Nadir-associated companies.
He suggested that calculated leaks had continued until last week when some
of his own correspondence with the attorney-general was given to a national
newspaper and thus precipitated his resignation.
Mr Mates, who said he had discussed the case with Mr Anthony Scrivener QC,
Mr Nadir's counsel, went on to claim that there had been 'illegal collusion'
between the SFO and the Inland Revenue. He would be happy to give evidence
of this collusion to an independent inquiry. Mr Mates said the SFO had
wrongly opened bags of documents while their privileged legal status was
being examined by independent counsel.
Mr Mates's most startling allegation was reserved for the end of his speech.
Referring to the 'most serious aspect of this whole affair', he said that
'quite improper pressure has apparently been exercised by the SFO upon the
trial judge Mr Justice Tucker. It is this sequence of events above all which
demands independent inquiry'.
Mr Mates said that in an attempt to 'destabilise' Mr Nadir's defence,
counsel for the SFO had first suggested that there might have been an
attempt to bribe Mr Tucker.
In a later hearing, said Mr Mates, counsel for the SFO suggested the police
were investigating a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Mr Mates
continued: 'The suspected conspirators were, said counsel, Mr Nadir, Mr Wyn
Jones, assistant commissioner of Metropolitan Police, Mr Anthony Scrivener
QC and the judge himself, Mr Justice Tucker. Needless to say the police have
not ever questioned the judge, Mr Wyn Jones or Mr Scrivener.'
The claim by Mr Mates that the SFO had applied 'improper pressure' on Mr
Justice Tucker was dismissed as 'complete nonsense' last night by a central
figure involved in the investigation into the allegations that an attempt
had been planned to bribe the judge.
The source, who is totally unconnected with the SFO, said that while the
SFO's barrister had invited Mr Justice Tucker to consider his position in
the light of the corruption inquiry, he had not misrepresented to Mr Justice
Tucker the intentions of the police, as was claimed by Mr Mates.

FT  30 JUN 93 / BT may face Oftel order to limit future special offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM may be forced by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to
modify or withdraw future special offers to customers. It also faces a
possible Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into its profitable
Yellow Pages business.
The threats, which have significant implications for BT's competitive
position and profitability, were disclosed in the prospectus issued
yesterday for the sale of the remaining tranche of government shares in the
company.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the international offer for the sale
will be priced at 160p a share for the first instalment, with 10p off for
investors in the UK public offer. The final price and allocations will be
determined after the close of the international offer on July 16.
According to the prospectus, Oftel is 'minded' to issue an instruction to BT
limiting future special offers unless BT can demonstrate that it has not
shown 'undue preference' to itself, as against competitors, in pricing for
the use of its network. Special offers are a key part of BT's strategy for
fighting competition in its UK market.
Oftel's action follows complaints from Mercury and the cable TV companies,
which say BT is abusing its dominant position and may be charging
special-offer prices below the cost of delivering the calls.
Two of BT's recent special offers are in dispute: this month's 'double
summertime' offer giving local callers double the time for the usual price
for calls lasting more than four minutes; and its 'Sunday special' offer
last November-December, under which all UK calls made after 3pm on Sundays
were charged at the local rate.
The prospectus also says that the Office of Fair Trading is 'seriously
considering making a monopoly reference of printed telephone directories,
including Yellow Pages, to the MMC'.
The OFT's statement follows a 19-month inquiry by it into directory
services, and repeated complaints from Thomson Directories, the main
competitor to Yellow Pages, about BT's control of its numbering information
system database.
City analysts estimate that BT's Yellow Pages division made pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 130m last year. One analyst said: 'It's not just the
profits: if BT loses control of its numbering database, a range of marketing
ventures is jeopardised.'
Thomson said yesterday it wanted 'equal access to this national asset on
terms which are fair and reasonable'. It also wants BT customers to be
charged separately for directories, instead of their cost being buried in
the line rental charge.
The OFT investigated Yellow Pages in 1984 and at that time it gave it a
clean bill of health. But the attitude of Oftel, which has advised the OFT
on the MMC reference, has hardened since then on the question of the
'ownership' of phone numbers.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bullion bank likely to change
hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MASE WESTPAC, the world's only bullion bank and one of the five members of
the committee that fixes the gold price in London, is likely to change
hands.
Westpac, the biggest Australian bank, which has been restructuring after
sustaining deep losses, has entered into heads of agreement to sell Mase
Westpac to Republic National Bank of New York. No price has been mentioned.
Republic is part of the international group controlled by Mr Edmond Safra,
the Swiss-based banker.
Mase Westpac was formerly known as Johnson Matthey Bankers. It was bought by
Westpac in 1986 from the Bank of England which had rescued JMB two years
previously after it got into difficulties with its loan book.
Mr Dick Gazmararian, managing director of Mase Westpac, is the present
chairman of the London Bullion Market Association. His predecessor at the
LBMA, Mr Robert Guy, a director of N M Rothschild, the financial services
group at whose offices the London gold 'fix' is held twice every working
day, said last night that, if the deal went through, Republic National Bank
would be invited to fill the seat at the 'fix' vacated by Mase Westpac.
Apart from its London operations, Mase Westpac also has branches and
subsidiaries in New York, Sydney and Hong Kong. Republic is said to be very
active in the physical gold market and as a bullion trader but has only
limited mining finance operations.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nissan starts to make it happen
in the US - North American prospects are brightening for the Japanese car
manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GANBARO] proclaims a large, hand-painted sign alongside an assembly line in
the Nissan automobile company's US plant in rural Tennessee.
The exhortation means 'make it happen' and, after a rocky, roller-coaster 10
years of manufacturing in America, the Japanese car company may at last be
doing just that.
Nissan's US car sales - excluding the group's Infiniti luxury brand - were
up 17 per cent in the first five months of this year, and its market share
rose from 4.1 per cent to 4.7 per cent.
Yet, over the same period, compatriots Honda and Toyota saw their market
share (excluding luxury marques) drop substantially. Toyota dipped from 8.3
per cent to 7.7 per cent, while Honda fell from 7.3 per cent to 6.4 per
cent, due to stronger competition from US rivals and price rises forced on
the Japanese companies by the strong yen.
Nissan's market share improvement in the US - when its Japanese parent is
losing money - is due mainly to the success of its new and keenly-priced
Altima family sedan, which has been selling much more strongly than the car
it replaced last autumn, the ageing Stanza.
Nissan desperately needs the Altima to be a winner. For, in contrast to the
success of Toyota and Honda, it has had a lacklustre record since it began
manufacturing in the US in 1983 - a history which demonstrates Japanese
motor companies are far from infallible.
Nissan led the Japanese import charge into the US market in the 1970s. But
in the 1980s, Japan's number two manufacturer (after Toyota), shot itself in
the foot with a series of strategic errors. US consumers did not warm to its
dull, boxy cars and lacklustre dealer network. They were confused by the
change of its brand name from Datsun to Nissan and later shifts in marketing
and advertising.
It also suffered from a lack of strong products in the more profitable
family sedan and mini-van sectors, while its Infiniti luxury cars,
introduced in 1989, languished in the shadow of Toyota's more
successfully-marketed Lexus range.
As a result, Nissan's US car market share has never been higher than the
5.89 per cent peak reached in 1982, even though Japan's share of the US
market has jumped from around 20 per cent to 30 per cent over the past
decade. Its unit sales of cars and trucks peaked at 831,000 in the US in
1985 and totalled only 585,000 in 1992.
Now, however, the company is improving on several fronts. The
boldly-modelled Altima, which originated from Nissan's Californian design
studios, shows the company has become much more attuned to US tastes.
The vehicle, manufactured at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, which also
makes pick-up trucks and the small Sentra car, has got good marks for
quality in independent tests.
The Sentra also scores well in these tests, though it has not always done
so: a 1991 study found almost twice as many problems with vehicles made in
Smyrna as the same cars made in Japan.
Mr Jerry Benefield, who heads manufacturing operations at Smyrna, rejects
suggestions that the plant's quality might have been sometimes less than
excellent. But he says the Altima has brought improvements: 'We learned to
do a better job in design and development, our suppliers are improving, our
assembly is improving and the technology to put it together is improving.'
For example, some of the Dollars 490m invested at Smyrna to produce the
Altima was spent on a new 'smart' system for assembling vehicle bodies. This
is a box-like steel structure which uses lasers to ensure greater accuracy
in welding a body shell together.
However, the Altima's success is also due to its low price. Mr Christopher
Cedergren, of the California-based AutoPacific consultancy, notes that while
the Altima is a very good product, it is priced Dollars 1,000 to Dollars
2,500 lower than rivals such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.
And that has led analysts to question whether Nissan is using the Altima as
a loss-leader to gain market share - and if so, how long it can afford to
maintain this strategy, given that its Japanese parent company is also
losing money at home.
Still, Nissan's US improvement extends beyond the Altima. The company is
doing well with the new Quest mini-van, also designed by Nissan in
California but which is being assembled by Ford.
Infiniti is starting to show signs of better market share, helped by a new
model and a new advertising campaign. And next year Nissan could get a
fillip in the full-sized car market when it introduces a new, keenly-priced
Maxima.
The US operations also have a new chief executive - Mr Robert Thomas, 48,
who has been with the company 11 years and replaced Mr Thomas Mignanelli. He
resigned in April amid rumours that Nissan's headquarters, which needs an
improved foreign financial contribution to offset its problems at home, was
unhappy at the subsidiary's performance, despite the improving market share.
One of Mr Thomas's first acts was to consolidate Nissan and Infiniti's
marketing operations as part of a worldwide Nissan programme to cut costs by
10 per cent.
Mr Thomas says he is not planning further big changes, though he makes clear
he wants to improve relations with Nissan's dealer network: 'I'm going to
spend a lot of time travelling and listening to what dealers have to say.'
His predecessor, while sometimes accused by dealers of aloofness, had moved
a considerable way in this direction, through a reorganisation which gave
more power to regional managers to solve dealers' problems.
However, Nissan's retailers are unlikely to be happy until they have a much
more competitive group of vehicles across the product range, including a
replacement for the boxy, entry-level car, the Sentra. Mr Cedergren reckons
that will not happen until the 1996 model year, when he expects the company
to introduce a small car similar to the Altima.
Nissan is now vying with Honda to be the second-biggest Japanese supplier of
cars and light trucks to the US market and Mr Thomas's ambition is to
'retain and solidify the number two position.'
But while the company seems better placed to do so than at any time in the
past decade, it also has a long history of false American dawns.

THREE Swedish companies - Volvo the vehicle maker, Trelleborg the mining
group and the high-tech company Spectra-Physics - are to sell a 51 per cent
stake in NordicTel Holdings, a mobile Swedish telecommunications group, to
Pacific Telesis of the US for Dollars 153m.
The sale will raise around SKr340m (Dollars 44m) for Volvo and
Spectra-Physics and SKr200m for Trelleborg. All three will remain
shareholders in NordicTel, each with 8 per cent.
NordicTel is one of three companies in Sweden operating a digital cellular
GSM telephone network. This offers superior voice quality to traditional
analog services and allows subscribers to receive and send calls in other
European countries with the same technology.
NordicTel, which began service late in 1992, operates under the name
Europolitan and has still to complete its network, which covers about 80 per
cent of the Swedish population. It also owns a 20 per cent stake in the
private Danish GSM operator Dansk Mobiltelefon.
Britain's Vodafone mobile communications group owns a 25 per cent stake in
NordicTel.
Mr Lee Cox, chief executive of PacTel, the Pacific Telesis subsidiary making
the acquisition, said Scandinavia was a very attractive cellular market.
Pacific Telesis owns a 26 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which owns
and operates D2 Privat, which claims to be the world's largest digital
cellular network.

THREE Swedish companies - Volvo the vehicle maker, Trelleborg the mining

stake in NordicTel Holdings, a mobile Swedish telecommunications group, to
Pacific Telesis of the US for Dollars 153m.
For Pacific Telesis, the deal represents another significant move to
establish itself as an important presence across Europe in mobile
communications.
The sale will raise around SKr340m (Dollars 44m) for Volvo and
Spectra-Physics and SKr200m for Trelleborg. All three companies will remain
shareholders in NordicTel, each with an 8 per cent stake.
NordicTel is one of three companies in Sweden operating a digital cellular

Europolitan and has still to complete its network, which covers about 80 per
cent of the Swedish population. It also owns a 20 per cent stake in the
private Danish GSM operator Dansk Mobiltelefon. It has absorbed a total
investment of SKr1bn to date and is not expected to be profitable at least
until next year.
Britain's Vodafone mobile communications group owns a 25 per cent stake in
NordicTel which is unaffected by the transaction.
Mr Lee Cox, chief executive of PacTel, the Pacific Telesis subsidiary making
the acquisition, said Scandinavia was a very attractive cellular market,
with one of the highest subscriber penetration rates in the world, and the
deal would fit well with the group's other European wireless ventures in
Germany, Spain and Portugal.
Pacific Telesis owns a 26 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which owns
and operates D2 Privat, which claims to be the world's largest digital
cellular network.
Mr Cox said the deal would increase both the scale and scope of the group's
European operations, which, for example, would help it in the purchase of
GSM handsets and in rapidly applying lessons learnt in one country to
another.

FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: French insurer lifts holding in
AMB to 33.5%

ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest insurance
groups, yesterday confirmed that it was on course for a return to profits
growth this year and that it had raised its minority stake in Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) of Germany.
Mr Michel Albert, chairman, told shareholders that the figures for 1993 were
looking 'much brighter' than those for 1992, fuelled by sales growth in
France and the return to profit of its troubled UK operation.
AGF, a prime contender for privatisation, last year suffered a sharp fall in
net profits to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 261m) from FFr2.7bn in 1991, on
consolidated premium income of FFr59bn.
Nevertheless, AGF fared better than Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and
Groupe GAN, the two other state-controlled insurers which are also scheduled
for privatisation.
GAN last week warned it would have to resolve the problems of its damage
insurance business before flotation, but UAP said it expected a
'significant' improvement in profits this year and was prepared for
privatisation.
Mr Albert said AGF sales had risen by 5.5 per cent to FFr24.5bn in the first
five months of the year against the same period in the previous year. The
French life insurance business mustered sales growth of 12 per cent to
FFr8.7bn over the same period, with non-life business rising by 12 per cent
to FFr7.8bn. Foreign turnover rose by 9 per cent to FFr8bn.
AGF also confirmed it had increased its holding in AMB, the German insurer,
from 25.1 per cent to 33.5 per cent. The French group last year won a bitter
legal battle to exercise the full voting rights on its AMB shares.
Mr Albert said AGF had bought the additional 8.5 per cent stake in the
market in the response to the recent sale of AMB shares by La Fondiaria of
Italy to a group of German financial institutions.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Midlands rail plan setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a rapid transit system in the West Midlands fell into disorder
yesterday when the board of Taylor Woodrow, one of the two companies
selected to develop and run the project, failed to endorse a contract agreed
and signed by its negotiators on June 20.
Taylor Woodrow and Ansaldo Trasporti, the Italian rail equipment group, in a
consortium called Centram, had been selected by Centro, the operating arm of
the West Midlands Transport Authority, to construct and operate Midland
Metro Line One, a light railway to run between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.
A letter from Centram to Centro, dated June 20, undertook to provide board
approval for the detailed terms of the development and operations contracts
by June 28. The approval arrived from Ansaldo, but not from Taylor Woodrow.
Centro now plans to start negotiations with a second consortium called
Eurotransit, made up of Tilbury Douglas, the UK construction group, and AEG
of Germany. Centro said Eurotransit's bid was Pounds 9m more expensive than
the Centram contract.
Meanwhile, Ansaldo says it is ready to take on the whole project, meeting
all the conditions spelt out in the Centram contract. The project agreed by
Centro had a capital cost of Pounds 112m.
Taylor Woodrow's refusal to endorse the contract caught Centro and Ansaldo
by surprise. Taylor Woodrow said: 'Unfortunately it has not been possible
for us to finalise the contractual arrangements on conditions satisfactory
to all parties in the timescale imposed.'
The group, which originally wanted three weeks for endorsement, is engaged
in economy drives to avert losses in its contracting business and its
negotiators may have gone further in their negotiations with Centro than the
board thought prudent.
Argent Group, the privately owned property company, has taken control of
Brindleyplace, which consists of 15 acres of land in central Birmingham,
next to the International Convention Centre.
It will start work on a shopping and restaurant centre in September. The
previous owner was Rosehaugh, the property group which called in the
receiver in December.

LTV, the US steel company at the centre of one of the longest and most
contentious US bankruptcies, is coming back to the stock market, writes
Nikki Tait in New York.
The company said yesterday the New York Stock Exchange had approved trading
of LTV's new common stock and its series A warrants on a 'when-issued'
basis. The return marks the end of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which
began in July 1986. LTV finally had a plan of reorganisation confirmed by
the bankruptcy court on May 27.

THE DUTCH finance ministry yesterday said that the previously-announced
privatisation of a 'majority' stake in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the
state-owned body responsible for responsible for post and telecommunications
networks, would be of around two-thirds of the shares, in three or four
tranches, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
The ministry said the state would retain a one-third holding, and a 'golden
share' with special powers. These include the right to issue preference
shares in the event of a hostile stake or takeover bid.
As expected, the first tranche is to be offered some time in the first half
of 1994.
'It has not been decided exactly when the first tranche will be offered, but
we have been saying some time in the first half of 1994. It depends on how
good the market is,' a ministry spokesman said.
The advisers to the sale are expected to be chosen this week, although PTT
has said that US brokerage Goldman Sachs is to be lead adviser.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (27): Europe's unfinished business - Michael
Heseltine argues that the success of the single market will depend on the
determination of EC states to make it work / Guest Column
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HESELTINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SIX months the completion of the single market will provide an
opportunity to look at what we have really achieved and where we should be
going.
The framework has been established, the Community now needs to make the
single market work for European business and its consumers.
Within Europe, business needs the freedom to prosper in the way promised -
essentially in a deregulated environment; and it needs to win in overseas
markets. This objective is every bit as ambitious as the original programme,
and will require the same level of determination as was needed to reach the
'1992' deadline.
Community businesses thrive on international trade - between member states
and with the rest of the world. It needs free trade within itself and with
the rest of the world. Above all it needs to be competitive.
The single market has made a substantial contribution to international free
trade. It has demolished non-tariff barriers both within the community, and
in its trade relations with third countries.
When I look at some of the restrictive practices with which the community is
faced across the world, the concept that Europe has created for itself a
uniquely protectionist fortress is little more than propaganda. We want the
barriers down, wherever they exist, that is why the UK Government is so
committed to the successful conclusion of the Gatt Round.
Another important opportunity lies in the extension of the Single Market
through the European Economic Area and - before too long I hope  - in the
full community membership of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
1992 was an important achievement. But in terms of genuine competitiveness,
our work has only just begun. Agreeing single market measures is one thing:
businesses and consumers want to get real, tangible benefits from them.
Community member states now have an excellent record in putting single
market measures into national legislation. The test now is to put them into
practice. Businesses are learning to make and to sell to community
standards. They expect this to be matched by open access to markets and fair
and even enforcement of single market measures across the community.
This does not mean 'Euro-inspectorates', nor increased bureaucracy. But it
does mean national enforcement authorities working together in applying and
enforcing the rules.
The aim is to achieve close working relationships, co-operation and trust
between the enforcers in all member states so that problems can be resolved
quickly, without the need to resort to legalistic procedures. I welcome the
European Commission's initiatives to help achieve this.
The single market needs to be dynamic. We have, between us, already built a
strong foundation, but there is much more to be done. There are some crucial
gaps in the structure: notably telecoms and energy. These are two of the
most important areas of trade in goods and services which have an impact on
nearly every community business and citizen.
The telecoms market is equivalent to two per cent of total community GDP -
in the region of Ecu 90bn. As we have seen in the UK, increased competition
should, in both cases, boost investment; keep prices in check; and spur
innovation.
A real breakthrough was achieved at this month's EC telecoms council. It was
agreed that liberalisation of telephone services would be completed by
January 1, 1998, except for Luxembourg which will complete two years later
and Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland no later than 2003.
The single market needs to provide the environment in which European
businesses can develop, and become increasingly competitive. Yesterday's
mainframe computer is today's desktop, and will be pocket-sized tomorrow. As
technologies change, so do marketing strategies and business needs.
Any changes should be conditioned by clearly identified business needs. They
need to recognise that the community needs us to compete against the world,
which will give us no quarter if we burden ourselves with costs and
inflexibilities they do not share, for example, legislation on works
councils.
Companies do not take important decisions affecting their businesses without
carefully assessing the costs, benefits, and downsides. So why should
governments, acting through the community, enforce decisions on businesses
without themselves undertaking the same analyses?
It is the job of business and governments to make sure this happens; and to
make sure that we get our priorities right. The UK will drive deregulation
forward throughout the community. Already the community has been fairly
receptive to our ideas for cost benefit analyses in relation to all new
proposals.
The single market is about creating a competitive Europe. Companies must be
encouraged, and allowed, to compete freely within the community, and to win
new business in the international market place.
The successful operation of the single market will mean that community
companies will regard Europe as their home market, giving them a more
competitive orientation for success internationally. The benefits at the
macro-economic level are to be had in terms of GDP growth; reduced public
sector budgets; and counter inflationary influences. It means greater
opportunity, which feeds through to create new jobs and improve training.
Europe has to become more competitive. We need to win back, and increase,
our share of world trade. We need to reverse deficits with other developed
countries.
The community needs to improve its manufacturing productivity. In the 1980s
the community average lagged badly behind the US and Japan - the average
annual increase in real value added in manufacturing per person employed in
the community was 2.5 per cent, US 3.5 per cent and Japan 4.6 per cent.
But we must resist the temptation to go for quick fixes. Massive injections
of state aid; protectionism; agricultural surpluses; bending competition
rules are all short-term and short-sighted. They have not worked in the
past, and they would not work now or in the future.
The community already has a higher proportion of its GDP going in taxes and
public expenditure than the US and Japan. Over the 1980s taxes as a
proportion of GDP in the community were 43 per cent, in the US and Japan
they were 31 per cent. The public expenditure figures were 48 per cent in
the community, 36 per cent in the US and 33 per cent in Japan. We need to
put that right, and some of our colleagues in Europe who have in the past
taken a different view are now coming round. There is now a wider acceptance
among member states and the Commission of the need to avoid excessive
regulation.
The completion of the single market represents - to my mind - one of the
greatest achievements of the community. We faced an immense work programme,
and set ourselves a tight timetable. By the end of last year we had achieved
both. This is the clearest possible evidence that the Community can work
together and can get things done.
But to state yesterday's achievements is not to divert attention from
tomorrow's challenges. The process of change engulfing the world's economies
is not yet reflected in the same imperatives for enhanced competitiveness in
Europe; for example there needs to be a greater awareness of the threat from
the Pacific Rim countries. Targets, strategies - even visions - for the
European opportunity in the early 1980s look limp and rather weary as we
confront the 1990s. Perhaps Britain's historic perspective as an island
people will give us the strength and determination to explain to our
European partners that in today's ever more competitive world there are few
islands left in the world's economies.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (26): Financial turbulence shakes creditors -
Countries which have experienced payments difficulties / Credit Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL turbulence in Iran has shaken trade creditors in an important
export market, requiring the deferral of some Dollars 3bn worth of uninsured
letters of credit. Deferrals involve no refinancing, according to bankers,
and are intended to give Tehran time to tackle short-term debt problems.
Contracts awarded by the Islamic Republic became a staple for international
companies in the early 1990s, while the trade in Iranian paper was a highly
profitable feature of the forfaiting market, as exporters scrambled for
financing as Iran rebuilt after its war with Iraq. The arrears crisis which
emerged in late 1992 upset all that, leading many export credit agencies
(ECAs) to go off-cover and closing most exporters' access to commercial
finance.
Creditors reacted quickly to a crisis which took most analysts by surprise.
By April, a group of 11 German banks had agreed to put off for one year the
repayment of over Dollars 900m, setting the pace of the deferrals which
followed, arranged by Tehran with Japanese banks and trading houses owed
about Dollars 1bn, with French banks (Dollars 300m) and, reportedly, with
Swiss banks.
Deferrals should allow Iran to regularise its payments, including making up
an estimated Dollars 2bn of arrears owing on l/cs insured by ECAs. Agencies
like the UK's ECGD have gone off-cover even when their arrears are quite
low. Even if Tehran masters its arrears problem, securing new trade finance
will be problematic. Banks and ECAs remain concerned at the structure of
external debt of around Dollars 30bn, which is weighted towards short-term.
This is despite the assertion of Mohammad Hossain Adeli, Bank Markazi
(central bank) governor, that Iran's debts are trivial when compared with
its potential.
Market reports of large new problems elsewhere may be overstated. Pakistan's
political crisis and a fall in foreign reserves provoked concern, with
substantial payments delays, especially on unconfirmed l/cs. But leading
European banks are still confirming l/cs, provided they are issued by major
Pakistani commercial banks and carry short maturities, usually up to 180
days. Poland is generating new interest despite its debt problems, but l/c
confirmation remains costly. One European bank quoted FT Exporter charges of
7.5 per cent on each commission payable every three months. Another could
offer only sight with three months maximum validity.
There are market reports of arrears on Slovakian l/cs, but these are
selective and talk of a default is overstated. Banks are very cautious,
preferring sight drafts drawn on major institutions like Obchodni Banka and
General Credit Bank.
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is introducing new rules
covering documentary credits, to come into effect from 1 January 1994.
Revisions to the ICC's Uniform Customs and Practise are intended to clarify
shipping documentation, payments and other l/c procedures. The ICC believes
this will save exporters time and money by increasing the number of l/cs
paid on first presentation. About half of all l/cs are rejected first time
round.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (25): Fragile - handle with care - How the
Edinburgh Crystal Glass Company rationalised and speeded up the distribution
and delivery of its delicate, lightweight and high value products to
worldwide markets / Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, deliveries by the Edinburgh Crystal Glass Company were 'a
real mish-mash', according to Mr Douglas Arbuckle, the company's export
manager. Some customers asked for products to be sent by mail, some used
their own air freight consolidation services and others used surface mail.
The big change in distribution - in particular to the US - came when United
Parcel Service, the US-based international parcels delivery giant,
approached Edinburgh Crystal's Penicuik site near Edinburgh, Scotland, where
it has been making crystal glasses and giftware for over 125 years.
'We can pack something like Pounds 1,200-worth of crystal into a box which
UPS can deliver for us in the US within three or four days for about Pounds
30,' says Mr Arbuckle.
With an annual turnover of more than Pounds 20m, Edinburgh Crystal exports
all over the world to markets such as Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and the
Middle East. The US currently accounts for 20 per cent of total exports and
has been targeted for growth, particularly among corporate customers.
'That speed of delivery allows us to hold our stocks here in Penicuik and
ship out products in response to customer requirements,' Mr Arbuckle says.
'We do not need to incur the costs of having a warehouse in the US.
Likewise, our customers there do not need to hold large inventories.'
An air express service might typically account for 5-12 per cent of the cost
of the package, compared with 2 per cent for sea freight. 'If the package is
worth Pounds 1,200, then it will stand the cost of going by air. But if the
value is only, say Pounds 200, then it is not so viable.'
Air freighters come into their own as the need for speed increases, as the
bulk of the cargo rises and when the freight cost falls as a proportion of
the total cost of the consignment.
Crystal glasses fall into the lightweight, high value category, making air
freighting attractive. Other suitable sectors are electronics,
pharmaceuticals, specialised instruments, and spares for machinery.
Time advantages offered by air express become less obvious the nearer the
destination. Throughout the European Community a parcel can be transported
to to the customer within five days.
Sometimes local practices militate against air freight. In the Middle East,
importers tend to prefer to buy in bulk, making sea freight more suitable.
Some importers may be consolidating orders from various suppliers into one
cargo - in which case Edinburgh Crystal may have no option but to deliver
its supplies to a central point in the UK where the buyer's freight
forwarder will load them with goods from other suppliers.
Some large loads, for example volumes sufficient to fill a 40-foot
container, will continue to go by sea.
'We would never consider sending a full container load with an air
freighter. The consignments we send by air would typically be 20 parcels or
less,' Mr Arbuckle says.
The pattern of sending by sea is more pronounced in markets such as Japan,
Hong Kong and Australia where customers tend to import larger volumes by sea
and then store products locally. But in the long term, Mr Arbuckle suspects
that even these markets will begin to make more use of international air
express delivery services.
So it is to customers in the US, where UPS has a particularly extensive
delivery network, that air freight has much to commend it. Over the last
couple of years, most of Edinburgh Crystal's US customers have switched from
their previous modes of distribution to use the UPS delivery services
favoured by Edinburgh Crystal. That in turn has simplified the Scottish
company's administration activities.
Another important advantage of using a delivery company such as UPS, says Mr
Arbuckle, is that deliveries can be made direct to end-customers. Products
generally suffer fewer breakages while in transit, he says - partly because
the shipments remain in the hands of the same company all the way.
'The high value nature of our products means that on a unit cost basis, the
freight rate is not such a big factor in percentage terms. But if we use an
importer or distributor, our prices escalate and that would make us less
competitive in what is a very competitive market,' he explains.
The use of a door-to-door through delivery service to end-buyers in the US
also means Edinburgh Crystal can offer delivered prices in dollars, a
particular attraction for corporate customers used to dealing in that
currency in their other areas of business.
At the same time, US customs duties can be paid from the UK end. That means
US customers who may not be particularly conversant with import procedures
do not have to worry about activities such as customs brokerage.
'We can really make the whole thing more like a domestic transaction for
them,' adds Mr Arbuckle.
Why did Edinburgh Crystal pick UPS, rather than DHL, Federal Express, or
even registered speed post? UPS was the first to walk through the door. DHL
and Fedex offer similar services, at a similar cost: 'We used UPS on a trial
basis and were happy with both the service levels, and prices,' said Mr
Arbuckle.
'We have sinced looked at competing services, but have not so far had any
reason to consider seriously a change. Mr Arbuckle concedes there have been
some problems with UPS. 'We have had occasions when they have failed to meet
their delivery deadline but generally that has been due to freak conditions.
By and large, though, UPS have helped us immeasurably in terms of time and
cost.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (23): Honest broker role comes into its own -
Bidding for work in countries of the former Soviet bloc may be complicated
but can be well worthwhile / European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EXPORTERS bidding for build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts in eastern and
central Europe financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) face a strictly controlled tendering process. But the
business can be well worth the trouble and the EBRD's involvement has its
advantages.
Exporters have no formal relationship with the EBRD (although the bank may
well pay them directly rather than the procuring body), but as Bernard
Gouveia, who heads the EBRD's procurement department, explains, the bank
feels it can play the role of honest broker between the two parties once
contractors are chosen.
The Bank is bound by its articles of establishment to ensure the absence of
favouritism or bias, and to require the procuring authority, often a
state-owned utility or other authority, to seek open tenders from a wide
range of countries, not just members of the Bank.
The EBRD sets down detailed guidelines on tendering and 'advises and
assists' the client on the procurement process. This includes helping to
publicise the tendering opportunities as widely as possible, helping to
issue invitations to tender, and then the documents themselves, advising on
evaluation and administration of the resulting contracts.
The Bank is not a party to the contracts, but its continued involvement is
not restricted to disbursing funds. In practice, it continues to look over
the client's shoulder during the whole life of the turnkey project.
A recent example was the award this year of the second round of contracts by
Romtelecom, the Romanian state telecommunications operator, under its
15-year, Ecu142m (Dollars 167.7m) loan agreement with the EBRD. Agreements
were signed with Sirti of Italy and Tomen of Japan, to construct the first
1900km of a planned 5,000km fibre optic network which will eventually link
Romania with both Frankfurt and Istanbul.
The Romanians originally wished to purchase the optical fibre and construct
the network themselves, but they were persuaded by the EBRD that this was
too ambitious. Instead, the Bank proposed breaking the first stage of the
network up into three supply-install-commission contracts for which foreign
telecommunications companies would bid, with none being awarded more than
two contracts.
This, Mr Gouveia says, ensured a competitive environment for subsequent
contracts and reduced Romtelecom's reliance on a single supplier.
Neither company won its contract on price alone. The Italians bid Ecu14.80m
for a pair of circular networks in the west and centre of the country, while
the Japanese bid Y985m for the eastern section. Lower bids were received,
but these had either failed to meet quality levels or had not satisfied the
required commercial terms.
The EBRD's honest broker role really came into its own, however, after the
contractors were chosen. The optical fibre specified is still on the Cocom
list, with approval given on a case-by-case basis. When concerns were raised
on the contractor side about possible approval delays, the bank was able to
advise on the legal minefield, and also back up Romania's assurances that
the network would not be used for military purposes.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (22): A useful instrument - Bartering and other
forms of countertrade are a key to eastern Europe / Countertrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERE hard currency shortages in eastern Europe look set to guarantee that
countertrade, despite its administrative complications and in-built costs,
will continue to play an important role in fostering business relations with
this region.
Countertrade comes in various guises, including 'goods for goods' barter and
parallel counter-purchase and counter-sale agreements. However, a technique
which is being increasingly employed is buy-back, often in relation to joint
venture operations designed to boost, in tandem with western partners,
eastern European manufacturing capacity.
A model buy-back arrangement involves a western company assisting with the
installation of plant capacity and transferring appropriate technology and
equipment - and subsequently buying back the product emanating from the
plant and selling it on at a suitable margin.
One west European company which is concluding buy-back transactions in
eastern and central European countries, is the giant Swedish furniture and
furnishings retailing group Ikea. The company is involved in a continuous
process of buying from eastern Europe and selling in western markets, as it
strives to reduce costs by locating new sources of supply and increasing its
product range.
Buy-back is an essential part of this process, as Ikea supplies an eastern
European enterprise (or an east-west joint venture) with machinery and
equipment to allow a plant to increase and upgrade production to meet Ikea's
quality conditions and purchasing specifications.
Thus, some western European manufacturers of the required equipment, largely
small and medium-sized enterprises, are also able to make sales to factories
in eastern Europe through Ikea, without themselves becoming a principal
party to the goods buy-back procedure.
Most of Ikea's arrangements involve the leasing of equipment to the east
European partner, according to Herbert Finck, Ikea's east and central Europe
director of trading services.
With the leasing arrangement, Ikea will then give that enterprise an export
contract in order to provide it with cash flow. The enterprise is then in a
position to pay the leasing fees from the revenue earned from the export to
Ikea of the resultant goods.
Mr Finck says that the west European sourced equipment is going into
existing plants and can be quickly installed in order to achieve a swift
increase in production capacity.
For the small to medium-sized west European manufacturer, riding on the back
of a giant operator like Ikea makes sense in the difficult trading climate
still prevailing in eastern Europe.
According to Mr Finck, such leasing-based buy-back arrangements are
structured with a repayment of between three and five years. Ikea usually
works on the basis of buying products worth three or four times more than
the value of the equipment put in.
Recently, Ikea supplied a Polish-based joint venture company with Pounds
300,000 of equipment, mainly drilling and planing machinery and equipment
for lacquering wooden lamps, which was sourced from west European companies.
The deal was struck on a leasing-based buy-back basis.
In another case, Ikea provided Pounds 500,000 worth of equipment sourced in
western Europe, to an enterprise in the Czech Republic. The equipment
included sewing machines and leather and fabric cutting machines.
A UK manufacturing company that has managed to find access to eastern Europe
through Ikea is the Wadkin Group, a Leicester-based wood processing
machinery producer. Such arrangements ensure straightforward payment to
Wadkin from Ikea. The UK-produced equipment goes directly to the east
European enterprise, and the overall arrangement provides a way around the
problems that a small to medium-sized company faces when dealing with the
eastern European market.
Geoff Stainton, a specialist east European marketing consultant working for
Wadkin, says that smaller-sized UK companies are facing an uphill struggle
in dealing with eastern Europe. Links established with a large company such
as Ikea are invaluable.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (21): Lubricating the cash flow - A
cost-effective and efficient mechanism for expediting payments by cheque in
Europe, Britain and the US / Lock boxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK RUNIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are times when it is not good news to hear that 'the cheque is in the
post'. Not when it may take four weeks to clear. When cash flow is critical,
every day lost before the cheque is cleared can be costly. But a 'lock box'
can change all that.
Even though there are quicker ways of getting paid - like electronic
transfer (though even this can be delayed if you fail to provide the buyer
with full and accurate details, including a bank identification code) -
still a large share of trade around Europe is settled by cheque.
Some buyers prefer cheques as a deliberate ploy to delay payment: after it
arrives, the cheque must be presented to a local bank branch, which will in
turn forward it to the national headquarters of your company's bank, which
must in turn present it to the buyer's bank overseas.
This loop can take 28 days to clear.
Many companies are also unaware that, when they present cheques drawn on an
overseas bank to their bank and their account is immediately credited with
sterling, they are receiving an advance. The bank charges interest for the
advance, which is built into the exchange rate and is called a negotiation.
Should the cheque be countermanded or unpaid when presented to the overseas
bank on which it is drawn, the UK bank will reclaim the advance converting
sterling into the currency of the cheque at the prevailing exchange rate.
One (typical) UK company receives cheques from its German buyer drawn on a
bank in Frankfurt. The UK company pays the cheques into its UK bank account
and immediately receives sterling. A recent cheque was received for
DM250,000 and was converted at the cheque buying rate of DM2.4875 to the
pound, providing Pounds 100,502 less bank charges of Pounds 60. The company
also had this advance marked against its banking facilities.
Had the German buyer remitted the funds electronically the UK supplier would
have received a further Pounds 874 at an exchange rate of DM2.4675 to the
pound. The UK company receives 20 cheques a year from this source but was
not aware of the hidden costs in excess of Pounds 17,000 per annum accruing
by transacting business using this method. The company was selling to other
markets in a similar manner and costs in excess of Pounds 65,000 were
identified.
So exporters should remember that the buyer extends the credit period at
their expense.
If you have no choice but to accept payment by cheque, the 'lock box'
arrangement can also be used to cut the payment loop back to five days. It
works like this: if the buyer is a German company you set up a 'lock box'
bank account with a reputable German bank.
You then ask the German buyer to present the cheque to the German bank,
giving full account details of the 'lock box'.
This clears at the same speed of a domestic cheque, and once deposited can
be notified to your main banker in France, the UK or elsewhere in Europe.
The cheque will not only be cleared quickly, but the funds can be remitted
electronically to the exporter's UK bank account.
The lock box is available in Europe, north America and the UK and provides a
cost-effective and efficient solution for companies receiving cheques drawn
overseas and helps exporters avoid one of the tripwires in trading overseas.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (20): Short cut to an uncertain deal -
Forfaiters believe their services could soon be in great demand by companies
in the new export markets of the east / No-cash Trading
</HEADLINE>

A Romanian company needs to import cotton but can't pay for it. A Turkish
company can supply the cotton, but is unwilling to extend credit or get
involved in countertrade.
The solution: the buyer and seller turn to a specialist bank known as a
forfaiter which pays the Turkish exporter and takes the invoices at a
discount to face value.
The bank seeks payment from the exporter - or if necessary the guarantor,
the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade - when it falls due in 180 days.
There could be no better example of a 'pure a forfait' deal than this one
arranged by the specialist forfaiter, Indosuez Aval.
The deal was completed without the exporter having to repay any of the
funding to the forfaiter, because it is known as a 'without recourse' deal -
a distinctive characteristic of forfaiting.
Other traditional characteristics include trading partners in the former
eastern block; multi-million dollar deals involving medium-term funding and
capital goods purchases.
Forfaiting can be an expensive route and takes time to arrange, but it can
be valuable in enabling trade to occur when other means of ensuring payment
and smooth cash flow are uncertain, and in those deals that may not be
possible by any other means.
It evolved in the post-war years to finance east-west trade and remains a
non-recourse instrument which might be used for sales in high-risk
situations.
Some banks and a tiny handful of specialists provide the services, details
of which are available through the main clearing banks - if the buyer is an
east European company, it is likely it will already be familiar with
specialists like Indosuez and the London Forfaiting Company.
Romania is no easy market, with the export credit agency (ECA) giving
limited cover and few banks keen to add to their country risk.
Deals can be transacted through 90 or 180-day letters of credit (l/c), but
confirmation can be problematic.
Pure a forfait deals typically finance goods worth several million dollars
in markets where the exporter might otherwise feel exposed to unacceptable
risk.
It can also help exporters make a move into new markets - a South African
telecommunications supplier recently forfaited equipment sales to Hungary.
This deal was arranged by South Africa's Finansbank with London forfaiters
participating.
Indosuez Aval, the London-based forfaiting arm of Banque Indosuez, is now
working on another Romanian transaction, to finance the sale of crude oil
worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) out of Europe on 90-day terms, again taking
paper guaranteed by BFT. But Romania is a niche market. Few forfaiters still
have an appetite for Romanian paper - and then for only one to two years.
Markets with extensive debt problems, such as Russia, Bulgaria and Iran,
have left the forfaiting industry with a much reduced capacity to take on
new risk in the 1990s. 'The Soviet Union, the biggest a forfait market in
eastern Europe, is dead And it took a few people with it,' says one analyst.
Caution is the watchword. Debt-ridden markets are now largely avoided by
forfaiters and many retail banks have pulled back from the market they
entered in the 1980s: some are holding substantial amounts of non-performing
trade paper. Bankers suggest the industry is again consolidating around
specialist players in Vienna, Geneva, Prague and London for East European
operations.
Much now depends on which local bank will provide guarantees on the paper to
be discounted.
In Russia, some forfaiters would still handle transactions guaranteed by
Foreign Trade Bank (Roshvneshtorgbank) of Russia, if it became available.
But several say they would only consider Russian transactions involving new
local/western consortium banks, notably International Moscow Bank, which has
French, Finnish, Italian and Austrian shareholders.
Forfaiting business, developed to finance trade with the communist block,
which by definition meant financing state entities, has not been stimulated
in the transition to a market economy.
'With ECA conditions and interest rates as they are, this should be a boom
period for forfaiting, but we are not really seeing it,' observes Charles
Bailey, trade finance manager at the London branch of Union Bank of Finland.
Among the reasons for this are reduced spending by state entities, now
starved of hard currency and access to credit, and the tendency for a
growing number of east-west joint ventures to use other forms of financing.
During the transition period, the nascent eastern private sector is
hard-pressed to envisage the sort of Dollars 1-Dollars 2m capital equipment
purchases that were the mainstay of international forfaiting.
Eastern Europe is also in recession, limiting public sector spending.
Bankers are concerned that many of the new commercial banks emerging across
the region do not yet have the ability to make the sort of credit
assessment, or the capital backing, successfully to guarantee the paper that
forfaiters might purchase.
According to a Vienna-based forfaiter, 'deals can take months to arrange, or
break down, because of lack of the right documentation'.
The London-based Hungarian International Bank reports that in Hungary, where
forfaiting is not traditionally used as a trade instrument, the technique is
now increasingly being used.
But the consensus among bankers is that most Hungarian companies will
continue to turn to other, sometimes cheaper forms of finance.
Czech companies usually work on l/c or direct loan terms, but a forfait
techniques are becoming more common. The Czech Republic has 'relatively high
levels of capacity in the market for proper trade transactions,' according
to Andrew Freeman of Indosuez Aval.
Poland is also seeing growing forfaiter interest.
In 1992, Indosuez Aval and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka established O B
Aval, a forfaiting joint venture, in Prague. Austrian banks, including AWT,
are also playing a leading role and the London Forfaiting Company (LFC)
opened a Prague representative office in January.
Much of this business involves Czech exports, rather than traditional import
business, reflecting a significant change in the market.
The Republic, with an industrial base manufacturing saleable machinery and
plant, has taken a lead. LFC has financed Czech machinery sales to Thailand,
Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Indosuez Aval arranged the Dollars 7.5m export of a Czech water treatment
plant to Egypt, discounting an 18-month l/c, avalised by National Bank of
Egypt.
Forfaiters believe their services could soon be in great demand by companies
in the emerging export markets of the east, as they originally were in the
import finance operations, leading to the development of forfaiting as a
means of non-recourse trade finance.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (19): Corruption crisis calls for change - SACE,
like other export credit agencies before it, is reducing its exposure in
heavily indebted markets - and could turn its attention elsewhere / Credit
Cover in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ARREST of a high profile businessman would normally hang in the
headlines for weeks. But not in Italy, where such a crisis seems an everyday
occurence.
Even the Tangentopoli crisis with the arrest in March of Roberto Ruberti,
general manager of Italy's government-owned credit insurer, Sezione Speciale
per Assicurazione del Credito all'Esportazione (SACE), did not appear to
have ruffled the discreet world of export credit agencies (ECAs).
Mr Ruberti was later joined in jail by his deputy and others allegedly
involved in abuses relating to SACE operations. Investigations centred on
some of Italy's largest foreign contracts.
With Italian business in turmoil, exporters felt the events acutely. Phones
in senior SACE officials' offices were no longer answered. Decisions on the
allocation of export credit dried up. Contracts were put on hold for lack of
insurance as the board of SACE and the inter-ministerial credit committee,
Cipes, were unable to meet.
SACE, along with Mediocredito Centrale (MCC), the state medium-term lending
institution, played a key role in the development by Italian industry of
strong exports in difficult markets. More than 50 per cent of all SACE
guarantees are provided in the industrial heartland of northern Italy which
triggered the export boom of the 1980s. But by 1992 it was clear all was not
well. Mario Draghi, the incoming Italian Treasury general manager, appointed
accountants KPMG to investigate SACE after hearing allegations of
irregularities.
There was concern about SACE operations before the Tangentopoli crisis. The
agency's high levels of exposure to heavily indebted markets, led by
Algeria, Russia and Iran, led the Amato government to reconsider its export
credit policy. In the last period for which figures are available,
January-June 1992, 58 per cent of SACE insurance was for projects in less
developed countries (LDCs) and another 36.9 per cent went to East Europe and
Asia. Only 5.1 per cent of SACE insurance was placed within the OECD.
Italian companies are anxious that SACE should return to business as usual.
'We need a strong SACE if we are to export ourselves out of our current
problems,' a Milan banker says. It is not just Italian companies and banks
that will be relieved when the crisis abates. SACE is one of the few ECAs to
allow international banks to bid for mandates backed by its guarantee.
An experienced Treasury official, Adalberto Rubino, was appointed interim
general manager in April to get the agency back on its feet.
Exporters increased pressure for credit approvals to resume. In early May,
Mr Rubino confirmed delays were occurring on indemnity payments, but this
was not due to SACE financial difficulties. 'Such a thing cannot exist
because SACE is guaranteed by the state,' he said. Rather, delays were
caused because contracts were affected by corruption investigations.
It says much for the priority given to exporting by Italian business and
political leaders that, by June, credit decisions were again flowing. SACE
was battered, but, with new management finding its way, had weathered the
storm.
Italian exporters underplay the effects of the crisis, arguing that it
involved a few very senior officials and only a tiny proportion of
SACE-backed contracts. Nevertheless, the crisis blocked the machinery of
credit and insurance approvals. It was not until May that SACE even started
to tackle a backlog of approvals. In some cases, such as a Dollars 34.5m
order for Gico Costruzione to build a stay-cable bridge in western Algeria,
this delayed work starting when companies needed only basic insurance,
rather than wider credit support. Gico required only standard SACE insurance
for a project otherwise funded by Japan.
Serious questions about the future must now be tackled. Even before the
Tangentopoli crisis, a potentially radical reassessment of how Italy should
provide finance and allocate aid outside the OECD was under way. This
started when, in line with EC recommendations on the future of European
credit insurance markets, Italy placed much of its short-term export
insurance into the private sector, where Societa Italiana Assicurazione
Crediti (SIAC) is the leading player.
According to a Rome banker, 'we urgently need to continue the modernisation
of our procedures, and the crisis may force the authorities to accelerate
that process'.
This could lead SACE to a greater concentration on OECD and financially
viable emerging markets in Asia and other growth regions. Well before
Algerian contracts were associated with corruption allegations, questions
were being asked about the level of support for Algeria, a country seen by
Giulio Andreotti, Bettino Craxi and Gianni De Michelis as a priority for
Italian foreign policy. The Amato government put plans for a new Dollars
4.2bn credit package for Algeria on hold - which, if disbursed, could raise
SACE exposure to a massive Dollars 9bn  - and resisted renewing the
'reprofiling' (bilateral rescheduling) of trade debt worth Dollars 2.7bn.
SACE will now take a prudent line in such risk, officials say. Cipes has
recommended that Algeria should obtain some new credits, which have been the
subject of robust lobbying by Italian export groups. But these will be
linked to repayments, with only up to 50 per cent of the amount repaid to be
made available as new credit.
The Cipes recommendation on Algeria suggests that SACE, like other ECAs
before it, is reducing its exposure in heavily indebted markets and could
turn its attention elsewhere. Officials refuse to comment on whether such a
pattern is emerging.
Also to be decided is whether new institutional structures should be
created. These might bring SACE and MCC together again, to create a
structure not unlike the US Eximbank. Other Italian 'peculiarities', such as
the provision of state short-term political risk insurance for periods of up
to 24 months and the advantageous cover given for civil works projects,
could be brought into question. Exporters in rival countries are waiting to
see if average SACE premiums will rise. Low SACE premiums have been
criticised by UK and other exporters as providing unfair competition.
Change will come, stimulated by the wider debate on Italy's role in the
world. This has been heralded by the attention paid to criticism of the
government's aid programme in studies by the OECD and by IRI, the state
holding company. These show that Italy has the most tied aid of any of the
industrialised countries.
A report compiled for the Foreign Affairs Ministry showed that only one of
13 recent aid-assisted projects in Egypt could be considered a success.
Success levels in other countries were also low, with criticism focusing on
tendering procedures and alleged abuses in publicly funded dealings with
Somalia, Sudan and other less-developed countries.
The OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) in May said Italy's aid
programme had failed to adopt effective management procedures, a
well-organised project management cycle and solid evaluation capacity.
Changes are planned, and across the range of Italian aids for exporters,
things will not be the same again.
But Italy seems set to remain a keen purveyor of export finance to secure
contracts. Even in a difficult case like Russia, there is a guarded
enthusiasm to get on with business not found in some other agencies. For all
Russia's debt problems, an official notes, 'our credit lines have been
negotiated - we are waiting to open them up as quickly as possible'.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (18): Risky states offer some prospects - The
potential for sustained expansion of sales / Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES FAIRRIE and ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA is dominated by three main economies, those of Brazil,
Argentina and Mexico, for each of which the US is the main foreign trading
partner, with Germany the principal European supplier of goods.
The region contains six other substantial and growing economies - Chile,
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela - of varying economic
performance and potential.
Most of South America's economies are capable of lurching from relative
prosperity and stability one year to economic crisis the next, but of the
three main economies Mexico and Argentina perhaps offer the greatest
potential for exporters with an eye for sales growth over the next 18
months.
Brazil has to tackle domestic problems, the resolution of which hinges on a
successful conclusion to the protracted Brady plan debt negotiations. As a
result, it could be some time before it offers good prospects of sales
growth to exporters.
Mexico is the largest importer of the three, with total imports in 1993
expected to exceed Dollars 58bn (Pounds 37.6bn). Semi-manufactures,
chemicals and medicinal intermediate products may amount to Dollars 33bn,
with capital equipment imports forecast to reach Dollars 13bn, and consumer
durables Dollars 8bn. Around 80 per cent of these products are sourced from
the US, and the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta) accord should
cement this dominant position. Payment delays average two to three months.
Mexico has a soaring current account deficit which will reach Dollars 29bn
in 1993 and is forecast to swell to Dollars 35bn in 1994. The trade
liberalisation measures of the 1990s and the structural reforms, including
privatisation, have been responsible in part for this. However, because
capital investment inflows have been so strong - around Dollars 15bn is
forecast for 1993 - total debt servicing of around Dollars 11bn in 1993
should be comfortably manageable. The peso has remained strong because of
high domestic interest rates, currently 14 per cent, and this, in turn, has
encouraged companies to finance capital expenditure with equity, rather than
bank loans. Germany, with 5.7 per cent of Mexico's imports, and France, with
2.5 per cent, are the country's main EC trading partners.
Argentina, with a GDP of Dollars 283bn, growing at 6 per cent a year, and a
low inflation rate by historical standards, of 12.5 per cent, is enjoying
increasing economic success. The main doubt is the large current account
deficit, the growth of which is being exacerbated by the government's
determination to fix the peso at par with the US dollar. This affects labour
costs which will have to fall to relieve pressure on the country's
competitiveness.
Imports, at Dollars 14.5bn in 1992, are growing at more than 20 per cent a
year, although the sharp cut in the expansion of M1 money supply so far in
1993 (13 per cent in 1993 from 49 per cent in 1992) should force households
to adjust their expenditure to a dwindling supply of domestic credit. Of the
Dollars 17.8bn of imports expected in 1993, around Dollars 6.4bn will be
manufactured product imports. However, payment delays are tending to worsen
 -currently up to four months in 1993 from three months in 1992.
Export credit agencies continue to offer a fairly generous volume of cover.
Germany's Hermes, for instance, is believed to have more than Dollars 180m
of short term cover, and the US Export-Import Bank (EximBank) has
underwritten around Dollars 70m of short term commitments.
This month, the UK Trade Secretary, Michael Heseltine, announced in Buenos
Aires the resumption of ECGD medium term cover for Argentina, commenting
that the move had been made possible now that Argentina had negotiated its
official and commercial bank debts, and was 'a recognition of the country's
success in implementing its economic reform programme'.
Elsewhere in the region, the other key economies in terms of GDP and
population size are Colombia (population 36m; GDP Dollars 50bn); Chile
(population 14m; GDP Dollars 40bn); Peru (population 22m; GDP Dollars 47bn);
Venezuela (population 20m; GDP Dollars 64bn); Ecuador (population 11m; GDP
Dollars 14bn) and Bolivia (population 7.5m; GDP Dollars 6.75bn). Exporters
and trade financiers are currently likely to find Bolivia, Ecuador and
Venezuela less satisfactory markets than Chile, Peru and Colombia.
Bolivia is facing a high trade deficit, lengthening payment delays - from
three months last year to current levels of around five months - and a
worsening relationship with the IMF as its structural adjustment programme
falters in the shadow of the forthcoming elections.
Ecuador is contending with high inflation, high currency risk, low foreign
exchange reserves, worsening exchange transfer delays, increasing political
unrest, and high foreign debt: its debt to GDP ratio is now over 100 per
cent.
Venezuela is struggling to handle a big public sector deficit, a high
current account deficit, a debt to GDP ratio of 58 per cent, and an
over-reliance on petroleum product exports.
Chile, meanwhile, has introduced structural reforms necessary to reduce its
debt and improve its internal domestic finances. Inward investment has
boomed as the Government has embarked on a determined privatisation
programme, and mineral and food exports were growing rapidly until falls in
world prices began to dent prospects of further growth in 1993.
Nevertheless, import volumes are set to maintain their growth. Imports now
total Dollars 11bn, of which capital equipment comprises Dollars 2.6bn and
energy products a further Dollars 1.3bn. Germany is the EC's main exporter
providing 6.5 per cent of all imports. While the current account is in
deficit to the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP (Dollars 1.6bn), this is
readily financeable, and, with Dollars 12bn of projects under active
development, export credit insurance is widely available among most of the
main credit insurers.
Colombia, with imports running at Dollars 7.5bn per annum (of which
intermediate goods comprise Dollars 3.5bn and capital equipment Dollars
1.7bn) is a sound market into which EC exporters are selling vigorously at
the present time. With high foreign exchange reserves (Dollars 7.3bn),
import cover at eight months and transfer delays at less than two months, it
is now producing few problems for credit insurers.
However, potential problems loom. Inflation is stubbornly high at 25 per
cent, and next year's presidential election, already vigorously contested in
the media, is creating political uncertainty. In turn, the latter is
delaying decisions on Colombia's two main domestic policy issues - how to
diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil, and how to improve the
productivity of Colombia's ailing State Oil Company, PDVSA, where
privatisation proposals are on hold.
Peru may be a more attractive target for exporters from the EC. Following
the recent election of President Fujimori, it is set for a period of
stability and growth. With a population of 22m and a GDP of Dollars 46bn,
now growing at 3.1 per cent a year, it offers useful prospects, particularly
for exporters associated with the power, construction and the fishing
industries. These are the expected growth sectors as privatisation plans
release pent-up demand.
Although Peru does have a high foreign currency debt - its debt to GDP ratio
is on the high side at 47.8 per cent - servicing at 2.4 per cent of GDP is
not a daunting problem in the light of the capital repatriation taking
place, following the election. Foreign investment is likely to be attracted
by plans not only to privatise the two electricity utilities, but also the
mining conglomerate Centromin, and the telecoms authority EntelPeru.
Many bankers feel that Peru is well placed to settle its Dollars 7.5bn Paris
Club rescheduling this year, and could then draw down its recently approved
IMF extended fund facility as well as Dollars 1bn of World Bank loans. A
Brady Plan restructuring is expected to be negotiated towards the end of
1993. EC export credit agencies are reassessing their country limit
availabilities for Peru, following the improvement in the country's economic
prospects.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (17): Actions speak louder - Keith Johnson hails
recent moves by ECGD, but says government should do more / UK Exporter's
view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN comparison with what we have coming to us, you are in heaven', said the
head of Siemens' Munich-based export finance division as we drove out of
London's Docklands, the home of the 'new' UK Export Credits Guarantee
Department, which gives long-term guarantees following the sale of its
short-term division in 1991.
My German colleague was ruminating over the positive discussions he had just
had with the apparently reinvigorated ECGD backed by trade minister Richard
Needham, as compared with the rigid export credit scheme run for German
exporters by the Hamburg-based Hermes.
For my part, I was remembering the recent pursuit of the 'zero option' by
sections of the UK Treasury to close the remainder of ECGD after the
sell-off of its short-term division.
As deputy chairman of the British Exporters Association I had been involved
in lobbying for change at ECGD. The extension of the breadth and depth of
cover, allied with some cuts in premiums over previous months, had therefore
provided relief and satisfaction. These moves represented a new commitment
by government to providing medium term guarantees. Not quite heaven perhaps
but a world away from the dark days of the 'zero option'.
Of course, the ECGD and the panoply of government support for UK exporters
still has its limitations:
Will the government become more active in backing exports to emerging
nations? Kazakhstan, for example, with its wealth of natural and human
resources will become a major influence in Central Asia in the years ahead.
When can we expect significant support for exporters pitching for business
emanating from attempts to reconstruct the Lebanon?
Opportunities abound in Vietnam, but UK exporters stand little chance unless
ECGD provides aggressive assistance.
Why cannot the UK government offer flexible political re-insurance capacity
to a registered number of credit insurance companies in the UK to overcome
the lack of political re-insurance capacity available in the market,
particularly at the short-term end of the market?
The government has responded sympathetically, but British exporters remain
concerned at the lack of re-insurance capacity.
This was recently demonstrated by a lack of cover in China, arguably the
most important emerging market. After a successful campaign in China by
minister Richard Needham, UK exporters were frustrated by not being able to
take contracts on to their books for lack of suitable reinsurance capacity
accessible by NCM or other insurers. This is despite the fact that ECGD has
significant capacity for project business in China, which has been
designated a key market.
The requirements of exporters, the potential financial implications of more
adventurous political risk underwriting and political imperatives or
priorities will never sit comfortably together. However, the exporter and
his government sponsor - ultimately the trade and industry secretary, Mr.
Michael Heseltine - deserve as much of a hearing at the Cabinet table as the
Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwelath Office.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (16): Taxing times for EC companies - New tax
rules within the European Community are more complicated than many had
expected / VAT Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES throughout the European Community have spent the past six months
adapting to the biggest shake-up in business taxation in nearly 20 years.
The creation of the EC single market on January 1 has led to far-reaching
changes in the way businesses account for value added tax. And the removal
of most border custom checks has shifted responsibility for collecting trade
statistics on to the companies.
With much of the detail of the new VAT rules undecided until the last
minute, companies have faced a desperate scramble to adapt to the
regulations in time.
UK Customs says it will treat genuine errors and omissions leniently in the
first few months. But business organisations such as the Confederation of
British Industry and the Institute of Directors have expressed concerns that
the new system is so complex that unintentional mistakes will be easily
made.
The new rules are complex because they are only part of a more far-reaching
change now to take place in January 1997. Because the new system is a hybrid
it has had to include a host of exceptions and special cases. EC member
states were unable to reach agreement on full change to an 'origin' system
of VAT in the run up to the single market, so it has been delayed until
1997. The system would mean that an exporter based in London and selling to
a customer in Milan would charge UK VAT.
Some doubt, however, whether governments will have the stomach to force
through a second VAT revolution in just four years.
A problem with the origin system is it depends on harmony between EC VAT
rates. And it could mean the UK dropping its zero-rating of children's
clothing and many foods.
It will also require the creation of a clearing house to redistribute VAT
revenues around the community. But some question whether this could work
effectively when countries such as Italy have a bad reputation for making
VAT transfers under the current regime.
In the meantime companies have been adjusting to their new VAT chores. Many
have had to modify and upgrade their computer systems to collate the
information previously collected by Customs or by their freight forwarders.
In the UK 140,000 companies are required to file quarterly trade returns to
Customs and 30,000 of the larger companies must file a more detailed monthly
return known as an Intrastat.
UK Customs calculates the once and for all start-up costs of the new system
for British businesses will be Pounds 100m, with a net saving of Pounds 135m
a year.
But these estimates have been criticised as being too optimistic.
Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick believes the change-over costs will be Pounds
200m when in-house costs of upgrading computer systems are taken into
account.
Because the new interim VAT regulations have not achieved the simplicity of
a thorough-going 'origin' system they have presented a number of special
situations, which make life more difficult for business. 'Triangular' trade
has proved far more common than expected. This is when a buying office in,
say, the UK orders goods from France for delivery in Germany. Companies have
been faced with registering in more than one country for VAT purposes. And
although a last-minute modification in the rules has been rushed through, it
does not cater for when four rather than three parties are involved in a
trade.
The commodities markets, notably oils and metals, have also encountered
unexpected problems. Shipments often change hands many times without moving
out of store. But under the new rules VAT is due on each transaction. The
VAT is reclaimable but the changeover has threatened to create a paperwork
mountain and serious cash flow problems.
And companies repairing or reconditioning equipment for a foreign customers
have found themselves liable for VAT because they are regarded as providing
a service.
In one instance, where two companies affected by this rule protested, UK
Customs proposed treating the two shipments involved as completely unrelated
transactions, thereby allowing VAT-free supply of goods.
Taxes are never popular but VAT is regarded, by small companies in
particular, as the most difficult to administer. UK Customs says it has done
its best to keep the new system simple.
The business community throughout Europe will be hoping that if further
changes are pushed through in 1997, the promise of simplicity is kept.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (15): How Uvex made its mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the inevitable problems with the European Community-wide 'CE Mark' is
that it can be based on the lowest common denominator.
Uvex, of Germany, an international leader in industrial and leisure
safetywear, has by-passed it.
The company had a sense of certainty when it entered the UK industrial
safety market nearly five years ago.
For its eyewear, it adopted British standards, which were higher than those
laid down by the Community.
For its footwear, however, it retained the German standards, which were
higher than those required from the British manufacturers.
'Whilst we are fully aware of the CE standards - and, indeed, we meet them -
we decided to stay with the stringent British standards for eyewear,'
commented David Howell, Uvex's UK managing director.
'No-one to date has asked us about CE marking on our products. Personally, I
feel this is a combination of people not being fully aware of it or really
worrying at this stage.
'We have simply stayed with the highest standards. It may be that in some
countries the CE marking provides consumers with a standard that is higher
than what they might have been used to previously.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (14): A glimpse into the labyrinth - CE Marking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE lawnmower has taken a starring role as the most cited example of the
problem that could possible face a manufacturer applying for CE marking,
writes Tony Bush.
On a wet day, there could be a danger of the user being electrocuted. So the
manufacturer needs to comply with the low voltage electrical regulations.
However, on a fine day, the European Commission feels that the greater
danger in fact lies in the gardener cutting his toes off.
In this case, he has to comply with the machinery safety rules.
So the supplier, before making a CE application, has to decide which is the
biggest safety hazard, no doubt after consultation with the international
weather forecasters.
Ridiculous though such conundrums may be, they are critical. Once a company
has won a CE mark, its product can be sold without hindrance across the
community.
And lawnmowers provide just a glimpse into the labyrinth.
But help may soon be on the way because the EC is preparing to standardise
the provisions under which applications are made.
On the other hand ..

Community plans to introduce CE marking as a sign of conformity but it does
not deter national preference / Trade Barriers

IT could have been a classic case of Double Dutch for Pitney Bowes, a world
leader in mailing equipment, when Holland proposed a ban on bromine
additives in plastics.
But the company, which has a good market in the Netherlands for its franking
machines, was tipped off 18 months in advance by Technical Help for
Exporters (THE), part of the British Standards Institution. It acted on the
warning by changing the constituents of its plastic mouldings.
The company also received a BSI translation of the new directive from Dutch
to English. Without the warning it may have found its machines were no
longer acceptable imports.
Mr Praha Kanagasabai, Pitney Bowes product safety manager, says: 'If we had
not been geared up for the additives ban, it would have had serious
implications for us, not just in Holland but possibly elsewhere because it's
likely that the directive will become a European standard.
'The early alert allowed our corporate materials group in the US to work out
how to extract bromine additives from plastic, and they have now come up
with a new material similar in cost, performance and characteristics.'
THE has also guided Pitney Bowes' UK and American divisions through the
complex technical requirements of the new European Low Voltage and
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) directives.
Mr Kanagasabai says: 'The EMC requirements in Germany and other parts of
Europe are continuously changing. To accommodate new product design to meet
these directives, our information and data on various countries are
constantly updated by THE, which also advises on transitional requirements.
Another grateful recipient of THE's help is JCB, Staffordshire manufacturers
of excavation, earthmoving and materials handling equipment for the
construction and agricultural industries.
THE has provided the company with what it considers its bible - the Blue
Book for the Mobile Construction Industry - a series of books, comprising
1,500 pages that set out a plethora of detail on directives, legislation and
the minutiae of the industry, from machine vehicle widths to advice on
spindle knobs.
JCB says: 'This is the definitive document for our type of equipment. It's a
very specialised work of reference - available for other industry sectors,
too - that we can use on a day-to-day basis. Naturally, everything's
constantly changing but THE provides us with updates.'
THE ensures exporters and would-be exporters' products comply with technical
requirements anywhere in the world. It also advises on international and
national standards, regulations, codes of practice, certification systems
and testing and inspection procedures.
To encourage companies to use its services, it has recently reduced its
charges significantly. Information is supplied on a free basis provided the
inquiry is answered within 30 minutes. And companies with fewer than 200
employees are eligible for a 50 per cent reduction in export consultancy
projects lasting up to three days. The full cost of this service is between
Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 2,000.
THE staff are also available for hire as consultants to inspect designs or
product samples and to advise on modifications, or to carry out in-depth
research in a particular country. The cost is Pounds 650 a day plus travel
expenses, although reduced-price 'packages' can be agreed.
The European Community's plans to introduce its own harmonised mark of
conformity - CE marking - will help remove many of THE's standards problems.
Any product bearing the marking will have met criteria laid down by the
relevant EC New Approach Directive and will be acceptable in any country
within the EC. Products so far affected include toys, gas appliances,
machinery and weighing instruments.
CE marking, introduced in 1990, indicates that goods meet certain general
parameters laid down in a directive, rather than conforming to a particular
type. Where national standards conflict with agreed European standards they
have to be withdrawn. But the majority of goods are not covered by EC
directives and therefore continue to be governed by national standards.
Mr Derek Francis, head of the electrical section at THE, says: 'The process
is still in its transitional stage, but although the CE marking will mean an
item has met the essential requirements of a directive, this does not mean
it will necessarily meet national preferences.'
Herein lies a potential 'time-bomb'. Many believe that even when European
trade is harmonised 'national rules' may be illegally applied to block bona
fide trade.
Mr Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export, says: 'It's
fine for the directive to be introduced. The problem is one of compliance.
Some countries' authorities may try to block exports with the CE marking
saying they don't comply with their national health and safety regulations,
which came under the Factory Inspectorate, or with consumer protection
rulings, overseen by trading standards officers.
'So, in other words, although the CE marking demonstrates conformity, this
is only the first step because, thereafter, you are exposed to national
preferences. The level playing fields idea is excellent in theory but while
we may follow the rules, some of our competitors don't'
But any company which believes its products have been rejected by an
invidious application of 'national standards', or some other unfair ploy,
can appeal to the Department of Trade and Industry's Single Market
Compliance Unit (SMCU), set up to resolve difficulties caused by breaches of
EC rules. The unit is currently dealing with about 50 cases, 15 of which
concern standards.
According to the SMCU, single market rules on standards only apply to the
public sector, as private sector clients are free to set their own
requirements because they are not bound by EC public purchasing rules.
Public sector or monopoly buyers are subject to the rules and cannot impose
standards favouring nationals.
The SMCU deals with problems such as an exporter not being given a test date
for a product, or delays in receiving the test results. Or 'general
obfuscation directly or indirectly interfering with the free movement of
goods', the unit says.
The SMCU can take such matters up with a member state through Brussels,
ministers can contact their counterparts in the member state or ambassadors
can raise matters with the ministry concerned.
The DTI says: 'Everything we do for an exporter is treated confidentially.
The SMCU wants the company to be satisfied and so it looks for the best,
quickest result. We always have commercial reality in mind.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (12): Fending off the product predators -
Varying attitudes to protection in three patent cases / Patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS little point having a wonderful product to export if foreign
competitors jump on to your bandwagon as soon as it hits the market place.
The obvious answer is to surround the product with patents.
But what real protection do patents provide? Whatever the theory, the
following cases demonstrate the different attitudes towards them.
Renishaw, the Gloucestershire-based maker of high precision measuring
probes, now exports most of its Pounds 45m turnover. But when Mr David
McMurtry, chairman of Renishaw, first commercialised the probe in 1970 -
after developing it on Rolls-Royce's Concorde programme - the company was a
minnow in international terms.
Mr McMurtry immediately set up a ring fence of patents to include not only
international protection for the touch-trigger probe - which measures
machined parts to tolerances of one-third of a micron - but also for new
applications using the original design. Upgraded models received equal
international protection.
But this painstaking and expensive protection of the technology could have
been in vain but for a lucky break. Mr McMurtry wanted to develop his
technology alone, but Rolls-Royce said he could only do it under licence.
Part of the deal was that Rolls-Royce would help protect the patents.
Renishaw's opposition therefore knew they had to also contend with
Rolls-Royce - with its financial resources and reputation - in any attempt
to grind down the smaller company in a protracted law suit.
'If I had been on my own, bigger companies would have copied and told me to
sue,' says Mr McMurtry, who in 1976 fought and won his first patent battle
with DEA, an Italian maker of automated equipment. It lasted two years but
victory enabled Renishaw to maintain handsome profit margins, allowing
research, development and growth funding.
Proteus International, which designs and develops drugs with its own
proprietary software, is at a much earlier stage of development, but is
equally jealous of its technology.
Like many small innovative pharmaceutical companies, Proteus lacks the
resources to develop all its drugs through to market. Despite creating the
intellectual property rights and securing the patent, Mr Kevin Gilmore, the
chairman, believes they are difficult and expensive to defend and is
suspicious of collaborative ventures with larger companies.
'You can out license,' he says. 'But if you do that, I think you are in a
vulnerable position.
In the past many of the larger companies have screwed smaller companies by
saying we now have access to the IPR and are now developing a derivative
that is slightly different so we don't want to pay the royalties.'
Proteus's solution has been to set up fully incorporated joint ventures.
These would typically have full board structures and articles of association
to include provision that derivatives remain corporation property - not the
shareholders.
Any disputes are governed by corporate law. 'The large company is locked
into a corporate structure whereas in an out license or a collaborative
arrangement it simply has a legal agreement,' says Mr Gilmore.
The model has been used by Proteus in a fish vaccine joint venture with
Cobequid Life Sciences of Canada. And Mr Gilmore expects to sign at least
two ventures with large pharmaceutical groups later this year. He accepts
nothing can be guaranteed but says he has narrowed the scope for losing
control of potential money spinners.
Amersham International, the health science group with specific expertise in
making and handling reagents based on radioactive substances, has a more
traditional approach to defending its technology.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, says the biggest patent action he could
face is Pounds 3m. He says he would have no compunction sanctioning such
expenditure if necessary.
Any attempt to infringe patents in the group's recently acquired US
Biomedical, will be vigorously defended, Mr Castell says. The patents have
been carefully maintained at Biomedical, which is primarily involved in
making enzymes used by genetic researchers to determine DNA sequences.
Amersham believes the need for protection in other areas of its work is less
acute as there are large technological barriers to entry into the market. Mr
Kirk Stephenson, Amersham finance director, says there is a small club of
only three international nuclear-medicine companies. 'The technology is
complicated,' he says. 'It is difficult to reproduce the production
technique - you have to work hard to charge the isotope.'
In fact, Metastrom - a cancer pain reliever and the product expected to
become the group's largest seller with potential annual sales of Pounds 100m
 -is not covered by patents at all.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (11): Persistent and ingenious
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYING a Swiss consultant to advise on continental European meat cuts;
having products assessed to several national standards; becoming a permanent
feature at international trade fairs.
Export sales require ingenuity and persistence, to judge by this year's
winners of the Export Award for Smaller Businesses.
The five winners were:
Donald Russell, a supplier of Aberdeen Angus beef, Scottish lamb, salmon,
bacon and game to hotels and restaurants throughout Europe and the Far East.
The company, based in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, has built up a network of
overseas wholesalers over the past two years but last December also opened
its own office. Exports account for all but Pounds 400,000 of its Pounds
6.9m sales.
Desurvey has paid particular attention to its credit control systems so as
to obtain competitive funding for the engineering design services it
provides for the offshore and petrochemical industries. Based in Birkenhead,
it makes export sales of Pounds 6.2m out of a total Pounds 6.8m.
Mayflower Glass, a Tyneside-based manufacturer of glass sculptures, stresses
detailed market research and language skills - staff speak seven languages -
as important factors in winning exports. Exports account for nearly 70 per
cent of total sales of Pounds 3.65m.
BCB International, a supplier of safety and survival equipment, says its
staff attend about 15 exhibitions a year a well as making regular overseas
visits to customers. A family company based in Cardiff, it makes Pounds 2.4m
worth of exports out of total sales of Pounds 3.7m.
Technic Group (see profile), a manufacturer of retreaded tyres, has to pay
particular attention to quality and safety standards but has benefited from
a growing awareness of the environmental advantages of its products.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (10): One tread ahead of the competition - The
single market poses new problems for some, but not all / Profile, Technic
Group

MOST businesses tackle export markets after establishing a firm base in
their home country. But Technic Group, a Burton-on-Trent manufacturer of
retreaded tyres, was set up to break into the European market.
Six years on, 80 per cent of its sales - Pounds 13.3m in 1992 rising to a
projected Pounds 16-17m this year - are made in continental Europe. 'We set
up to sell overseas, expecting that probably 50 per cent of our sales would
be made outside the UK, but it has been between 70 and 80 per cent from day
one,' says Mr Chris Talbot, company secretary and finance director.
Technic is one of the five winners of this year's Export Award for Smaller
Businesses. The company's exports are handled alongside UK sales by the
12-strong head office staff.
Established in 1987, co-founders Mr Phil Blood, already experienced in the
UK and continental Europe tyre industry, and Mr Tony Farmer, experienced in
the tyre industry, power station maintenance and property development, are
equal shareholders and joint managing directors.
The company, whose sales and exports have grown rapidly, is building a
second retreading plant in Burton. This will expand current capacity of
35,000 tyres a week by between 35 and 40 per cent.
Growth has been achieved by focusing on a niche market, for car and light
van retreads, and by concentrating on manufacturing, says Mr Talbot. The
company does not, for example, handle its own transport and distribution.
Retreads have long had a down-market image but new technology has led to
improvements in quality and safety. Technic strips the used tyres down to
the carcass and then applies a new layer of tread and sidewall rubber. Tyres
can be made which are safe up to 150 mph, says Mr Talbot.
The traditional advantage of retreads has been their cheapness but awareness
is now growing of their environmental quality - there is no longer any need
for used tyres to take up large amounts of space in landfill sites.
Technic has developed its overseas business by signing exclusive
distribution agreements for its two brands, Technic and Eurospeed, in each
country. Distributors are then able to build their own national markets
avoiding direct competition.
Technic says an important advantage over rivals is its small but manageable
number of customers.
Distributors are visited at least three times a year by the joint managing
directors and technical, production and administration staff visit when
possible. Customers are also invited to Burton to view the factory.
The frequent contact allows the company to keep up with new developments in
tread patterns and tyre sizes and to assess levels of demand for existing
tyre types.
The company avoids foreign exchange exposure in sales by invoicing overseas
customers in sterling. Sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism
and its decline against other European currencies has given the company a
competitive advantage.
Technic runs a small foreign exchange risk on its purchasing side for used
tyres from continental suppliers. Most of its used tyres are purchased in
the UK, although some sizes come from the Continent. 'We don't take out
forward cover on these because we make prompt payments,' says Mr Talbot.
Safety and quality standards are essential in the tyres field. Technic says
its tyres conform to BSAU144B as well as to ECE regulation 30, a test soon
to be incorporated into a revised BS, allowing tyres to be rated for maximum
speeds.
Technic has also qualified for the 'P mark' award from the Swedish National
Testing and Research Institute. The institute audits qualifying companies
annually.
Formal approval from the German test authority, TUV, has been harder to
obtain though Technic says its plant has been visited and commended by TUV
inspectors. Technic adds that pressure from German manufacturers has
prevented TUV from endorsing a UK manufacturer. This, however, has not
prevented Technic from selling into Germany.
The company has not applied for BS5750, the British quality assurance
standard increasingly demanded by UK purchasers. This is because ISO 9000,
the international equivalent to BS5750, has not been adopted to the same
extent outside the UK, and there has been no pressure from customers, says
Mr Talbot. The formal launch of the Single European Market on January 1 had
little impact on Technic due to its already extensive European business. New
VAT regulations, which have caused difficulties for many companies, have not
been a problem, says Mr Talbot. Technic has also received Customs &amp; Excise
help in adjusting its data collection systems and its procedures to the new
regime.
The company's early concentration on the European market has given it a head
start on other, more UK-focused rivals. But other retreaders have now
started to expand their overseas activities, so competition looks set to
increase.

THE GERMAN federation of craft industries is one of many organisations
representing the Mittelstand element in German industry, writes Ariane
Gennillard.
Financed by members' subscriptions, it operates 400 training centres
teaching the skills which give many of these enterprises their technological
edge.
The German states have various programmes to encourage innovation and the
development of overseas markets. All the states have technology transfer
offices, such as the Steinbeis foundation in Baden-Wurttemberg, which
promotes research and development for small companies. Most of their
programmes are state-funded but many are financed by selling their services.
North Rhine-Westphalia's economics ministry offers a consultancy programme
for those companies looking for new markets. Companies with a turnover of
less than DM50m receive up to DM665 per day towards a 15-day study of their
requirements.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (8): Export credit insurance dilemma creates a
mess - Unhappy experiences of one sort or another have resulted in the
clearing banks curtailing or curbing one-stop non-recourse finance schemes /
Non-recourse finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM non-recourse export finance is a 'very messy area indeed', says
Mr Steve Gill, deputy head of trade and international banking at Midland
Bank.
In spite of last week's announcement of more government support,
uncertainties persist in the export credit insurance market over the issue
of re-insurance capacity for the leading insurers, Cardiff-based NCM and
London-based Trade Indemnity. There are also administrative difficulties
with what Mr Gill refers to as 'plug in and off you go' short-term
non-recourse schemes.
The four big high street banks - often first port of call for would-be or
existing small to medium-sized exporters - are unwilling to provide
non-recourse finance to companies if they do not have the matching comfort
of a credit insurance policy to offset risk.
Resolution of the re-insurance debate will be a key factor in determining
the future scope of such schemes, mainly designed to guarantee up to 100 per
cent of the invoice value of an exporter's receivables on provision of
appropriate evidence of shipment. They are also aimed at promoting smooth,
positive cashflow from markets where exporters may find pressing for payment
is administratively, if not culturally, difficult.
The 'non-recourse' component means that the bank cannot reclaim up-front
funding from the exporter in the event of buyer default - although this can
be the case if non-payment reflects a contractual dispute between buyer and
seller.
The short-term export credit insurance debate aside, off-the-shelf schemes
designed to assist small to medium-sized exporters have also experienced
other problems, including high cost-return ratios - given the often one-off
nature of fundings; the fraudulent presentation of documentation; and the
maladministration of credit insurance policies - either by accident or
design - by the exporter. The maladministration results in the
disqualification of the bank from claiming on the policy if the importer
fails to pay.
Then, fundamentally, there is the question of demand for such schemes. Mr
Gill says: 'At the right price, every exporter would like 100 per cent
non-recourse funding'. So why have the banks not been inundated with
customers? Some believe the price is not right, despite the security
provided - particularly as the vast majority of business relates to more
secure Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
markets.
Others suggest that a certain innate conservatism among small to
medium-sized UK companies towards exporting, let alone the non-recourse
funding of sales, is also responsible. Moreover, trade financiers point out
that many seasoned exporters often even prefer to ship without credit
insurance cover at all, raising cash on overdraft against receivables if
necessary.
Unhappy experiences of one sort or another have resulted in the clearers
curtailing or curbing one-stop non-recourse finance schemes. Lloyds and
National Westminster Bank are not providing such services. Midland and
Barclays continue to do so, but in a more focused manner than before.
Barclays offers two such schemes, Tradeline and Tradeflow, which date back
to the mid-1980s. However, according to Mr Stuart Natus, head of the bank's
international trade services division in Coventry: 'We are not advertising
the schemes in a broad sweep, but suggest them where we identify a need'.
Mr Gill confirms that Midland is following a similar line, making the
provision of non-recourse funding 'bank-client', rather than
'product'-based.
Lloyds and National Westminster are both thought likely to return with some
form of packaged funding, but are still working on the details. However, for
all four clearing banks to widely offer such schemes in the future -
suitable availability of export credit insurance notwithstanding - they
would have to address what one export finance executive terms the 'flawed
ability of the exporter' to administer his insurance policies.
This could perhaps involve an experienced third party overseeing the
handling of an exporter's policy to the mutual satisfaction of both the
exporter and the bank.
Meanwhile, what other forms of non-recourse, short-term funding are
available from the clearers to protect payments and/or improve cashflow?
Broadly speaking all four banks offer a similar range of services.
Forfaiting is increasingly becoming a short-term weapon, say some finance
executives, although it was once regarded as almost exclusively a
medium-term, non-recourse financing tool.
Factoring is widely regarded as a more appropriate trade finance and
receivables collection mechanism for small to medium-sized exporters,
particularly where a stream of small-scale contracts is involved.
The service typically offers prepayment of up to 80 per cent against
approved invoice, protection against bad debts and the removal of collection
hassles away from the exporter. Service charges can vary, but National
Westminster Bank's scheme, offered via Lombard Natwest, says its fees are
between 0.75 per cent and 3 per cent of total invoice value, plus finance
charges at levels similar to bank overdraft rates for those using prepayment
arrangements.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (7): Unique contribution of middle-rank
exporters - Some 3.5m smaller companies - the so-called Mittelstand - are
the backbone of the nation's industry / Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENNILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S exports success is associated with its blue chip multinationals,
such as Siemens, Daimler-Benz or Mercedes. But it relies also on a uniquely
German phenomenon, the country's 3.5m smaller and medium sized businesses
known as the Mittelstand.
Businesses in this sector generally employ up to 500 workers each and have
turnovers ranging from DM50m to DM500m. Roughly half are suppliers to bigger
national companies. The rest export directly.
In the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which boasts the largest concentration of
Mittelstand business, nearly a quarter of the output of those employing up
to 200 people is exported. In North-Rhine Westphalia, 19 per cent of such
companies' turnover is export-related.
Credit for such achievements is due partly to the high quality of these
companies' manpower. Germany has more engineers per head than any other
country and produces more patents a year per capita than Japan or America.
These skills have been fostered by organisations such as the federation of
craft industries and Mittelstand organisations.
'We are good exporters because we have good products. And our success is to
a large extent due to the fact that Germany has developed a series of
assistance programmes, from education grants to export subsidies. These
programmes are specifically geared toward helping smaller enterprises,' says
Mr Arend Oitkir, head of the Mittelstand organisation within the German
industry federation.
However, in the present economic climate such schemes are not enough to
ensure success. Like the rest of German industry, Mittelstand companies are
feeling the effects of a stronger Deutsche Mark. They are also threatened by
rising domestic production costs.
Mr Hans-Eberhard Schleyer, head of the craft industries federation, says
'these enterprises are not able to rationalise like bigger companies. They
don't have the financial resources to go to foreign regions offering tax
breaks.'
In some branches, such as machinery, the twin difficulties of a strong Mark
and high domestic costs have made German products 20 per cent dearer than
their competitors abroad, analysts say.
'It has become increasingly hard for these companies to place their products
abroad,' says Mr Gunter Kayser, a director at the Institute for the
Mittelstand in Bonn. 'Our small and medium-sized companies are becoming
decreasingly compet
itive and their exports are suffering,' he adds.
The problem of high domestic costs has also been particularly exacerbated by
the necessity to pay for German reunification. 'Small and medium sized
enterprises, once the economic backbone of the country, are made the victims
of reunification,' says Mr Peter Helmes, director of the Mittlestand Union
within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
German workers have the longest holidays in Europe, the shortest working
week and bear some of the highest tax burdens, he explains. Taxes, once all
fringe benefits and social payments are included, can amount to 60 per cent
of the companies' revenues. Paying for reunification has increased the tax
burden. Additionally, starting in 1995, German companies will face an extra
7 per cent tax levied to finance public investments in the east.
The erosion of German exporters' competitiveness has thrown politicians back
to the drawing board, with proposals ranging from the introduction of more
flexible working hours to lower corporate taxes. But the effectiveness of
such measures, if adopted, will take time to reach the companies. Meanwhile,
times are rough for smaller exporters.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (6): A lack of harmony - An unlevel playing
field in a European trade barrier battle / Trade Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR MIKE FISHER, founder and managing director of Whale Tankers, is sore and
angry. Sore about losing money and perhaps a customer too. Angry because he
believes he was deceived into thinking the political totem pole of '1993'
meant something.
The sale of a hazardous waste tanker from the Solihull company to E. Bourbie
of Issoire in France, is the cause of dissatisfaction.
The tanker has been delivered at a charge to Bourbie of Pounds 46,000, not
all as yet paid. But the cost to Whale, excluding any knock-on effects in
terms of dislocated production for other customers, is Pounds 70,000.
The UK government is pursuing the tanker case, believing an illegal French
barrier to trade has been erected.
'Had we known,' Mr Fisher says, referring to Bourbie's manufacture demands,
'we would never have taken it on.' The company's undoing has been, as it
turns out, an unrealistic assessment of what 1993 has meant as a target date
for the completion of the EC internal market.
'We would not have accepted the order had we believed that 1993 would not
see us with a level playing field,' he says. He interprets level playing
field as 'if it was good in the UK, it was good elsewhere'.
But this has not been the view of the French authorities when following
through, between November 1992 and March 1993, the regulatory procedures for
the import of Bourbie's Whale tanker.
Regarding Whale Tankers' experience, Mr Richard Needham, the UK minister for
trade, has noted in a letter to Mr Iain Mills, the constituency MP for Mr
Fisher: 'There is at present no agreed European standard or EC directive
which covers vacuum waste tankers. Each member state is therefore free to
insist that its national regulations are complied with, where these are
justified and not excessive.'
But Mr Needham continues, 'national regulations cannot be used simply to
create a trade barrier and attempts to do so would breach the Treaty of
Rome' - which forms the basis of the European Economic Community.
Mr Fisher had accepted the Bourbie order for five tankers in October 1992.
By the following month Whale was running into difficulties meeting the
French regulatory demands: 'We were beginning to realise things were not
what they looked,' recalls Mr Fisher.
Talks with the British Embassy commercial section in Paris had brought crisp
and uncompromising advice - Whale had to make the tanker to French
requirements and forget political rhetoric about harmonisation.
Mr Fisher says Whale first approached the Direction Regionale de l'Industrie
et de la Recherche (DRIRE) in Bethune for guidance, but the only person able
to help was on maternity leave. Whale was subsequently directed to DRIRE in
Dijon.
A DRIRE engineer had visited the Whale works in Solihull, at the company's
expense, to confirm the tanker had been made to French criteria. The
engineer, however, asked for all the drawings and paperwork to be supplied
in French. A certificate was also requested confirming the tanker's steel
had been made to order. In fact, the steel, made by Thyssen in Germany, had
been bought from John Tainton, a West Midlands stockholder.
In the meantime, the delivery date had passed, and Bourbie was pressing for
the first tanker, threatening to cancel the order if delivery was not met.
The tanker was finally despatched at the end of March. But Bourbie had said
the fire extinguisher on the vehicle must be French. A new extinguisher was
bought.
French authorities then demanded that a part of the tanker be certified as
unique by a member of the Associated Offices Technical Committee, and not
Whale's usual company. This request was met.
The steel certification issue returned. Whale had sought to meet the
original demand with a letter from Thyssen to the stockholder and a letter
from the stockholder to Whale. But this was not sufficient. DRIRE had said
it would only issue certification, allowing Bourbie to use the Whale tanker
on the road, if the letter came direct from Thyssen.
Whale's relations with Bourbie are now uncertain. Mr Fisher says the episode
has hardened his innate distrust of governments. This manifests itself in
the slogan at the bottom of his company notepaper: 'Home of the great
British Whale and the certainty that nobody does it worse than government.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (5): Rich pickings ahead for UK industry - UK
privatisation has been painful, but reward for restructuring is near /
Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS is one of the world's fastest growing industries. In the
UK, however, growth has moved hand-in-hand with liberalisation, exposing
established suppliers to unprecedented competitive pressures.
The privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 marked the end of the old
client relationship between operator and supplier. And the growth of
Mercury, cable TV companies, long-distance competitors like Energis, and
mobile operators led by Vodafone and Cellnet, has helped transform the
national telecoms industry.
To service this new industry, overseas manufacturers have moved in to the UK
 -buying existing suppliers or establishing subsidiaries which in turn
become exporters to markets abroad.
Motorola, the US electronics group now has five manufacturing facilities in
the UK employing nearly 5,000 people, 45 per cent of the company's European
workforce.
Annual sales are above Pounds 750m, of which Pounds 450m is exported to 23
countries. Manufacturing of communications equipment, semiconductors,
cellular systems (handsets and infrastructure) and silicon integrated
circuits is carried out in Basingstoke, Swindon, and two Scottish plants,
East Kilbride and Easter Inch.
'Britain is an excellent base for penetrating the European market,' says Mr
Don Burns, managing director of Motorola's European Cellular Subscriber
Division. 'The UK is a vibrant market, our workforce is motivated and
flexible - and we are expanding far faster than expected.' The concentration
of manufacturing in Scotland is deliberate. 'Levels of skill training and
local support are excellent,' Mr Burns adds.
Most of the Motorola's UK jobs have been created in the past three years,
and Mr Burns expects 'significant levels of recruitment' over the next two.
Infrastructure demand is strong with the adoption across the continent of
the pan-European GSM standard for a new generation digital network. The
company is therefore planning to exploit a central and eastern European
telecoms market for products and services, expected to exceed Dollars 30bn
within a decade.
The leading UK telecoms equipment suppliers, GPT (a joint venture between
GEC and Siemens) and STC (bought two years ago by Canadian supplier Northern
Telecom) have had to sell hard abroad while re-structuring at home.
Change has not been painless. Last year Northern Telecom cut more than 500
jobs, mainly in Northern Ireland, blaming the recession. At the same time,
GPT closed a telephone equipment-making plant at Kirkcaldy, Fife, with the
loss of 250 jobs, citing the recession and 'newer technology'. The closure
followed the announcement that GPT had lost market share in a Pounds 926m
batch of orders for modernising BT's network, to Sweden's Ericsson which
took Pounds 346m. The loss would have been inconceivable before BT
privatisation.
UK companies which have kept pace with technology and liberalisation have
achieved impressive results. STC Submarines, which lays undersea
telecommunications equipment, this year has won the Queen's Award for
Exports for the third time. The award to STC, which employs 1,100 in the UK,
is based on exports 88 per cent up on the the past three years. And it
currently has orders worth Pounds 265m, including two transatlantic systems.
About 95 per cent of the division's revenue comes from exports.
The disparate location of its projects highlights the international
challenge facing suppliers. Its largest of recent deals is a Dollars 370m
contract to build the first fibre-optic cable linking Canada and Europe,
secured last October. Dr. Saul Lanyado, STC Submarine's managing director
says: 'de-regulation of the telecoms market has made our business even more
competitive than before and we have needed a very pro-active marketing
approach.'
STC's 'pro-active' style is illustrated by its successful pitch to supply a
cable network around the Gulf of Thailand. 'What really clinched it,' says
Dr Chris Lilly, the company's business development manager, 'was our ability
to offer a novel financial package through a joint venture with a Thai
telecoms company.' Under a build, transfer, operate (BTO) contract,
Thailand's telecoms authority will lease the new system from the joint
venture, and will not have to buy it outright until it starts generating
revenue.
'This involved a big change for us,' says Dr. Lilly. 'We were used to having
the likes of BT banging on our door and paying hard cash. Now we have to be
prepared to organise the finance. BTO-style projects are the pattern of the
future.' STC's new marketing slogan is: 'we can make it happen for you'.
Another company also making it happen abroad is GPT, which has 13,000
employees at Coventry, Liverpool, and Nottingham plants. Like many equipment
manufacturers, it is working hard at the Chinese market. It has recently won
a Pounds 2m contract to provide a complete telepoint network for the city of
Ningbo, including, it says, the world's first cordless PABX. Telepoint, one
of the least expensive but least flexible of mobile systems, has attracted
many users in the Asia-Pacific region.
The greatest opportunity for British suppliers, however, could soon be near.
EC plans to liberalise 'voice' services by 1988 will force wide open western
Europe's closed and regulated telecommunications markets, offering rich
pickings to a UK industry attuned to competition. If, for instance, claims
that Deutsche Telekom is paying two to three times as much as BT for
comparable German equipment are true, more Queen's Awards could soon be on
the way.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (10): A long wait for
'vaporware' - The prospects for the main operating systems strategies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WINDOWS NT 'represents nothing less than a fundamental change in the way all
companies can address their computing requirements,' Mr Bill Gates, head of
Microsoft, proclaimed at the end of May.
Modesty may be inap- propriate at the official launch of a company's
flagship soft- ware product, but it is fair to accuse Mr Gates of premature
optimism. Development of Windows NT, an operating system for a wide range of
computers, is well-advanced. But it will be at least two months before the
basic software is generally available and it will be even longer before
other important components are released.
It is, of course, a common ploy to announce products before they are ready.
It is the classic way to protect an installed base. Microsoft, like its
rivals, has used the ploy before - with the original Windows software, for
example - and will doubtless use it again.
Mr Stuart Allsop, a US newsletter publisher, coined the term 'vaporware' to
describe the practice. He regularly publishes a Top Ten chart of the
products which have been 'in vapor' the longest.
Windows NT has been on the list since the start of the year, after Microsoft
failed to meet its scheduled delivery date in December 1992. Windows NT was
first announced in April 1991 - putting it 'in vapor' for over two years.
Although NT officially stands for New Technology, it suggests other
interpretations - Not Today, Not Tomorrow, etc.
But it would be wrong to single out Microsoft for castigation. Novell, its
fiercest critic and closest rival in the operating systems market, had
similar delivery problems with the latest version of its NetWare networking
software. NetWare 4.0 was 'in vapor' for 13 months before being finally
released in March this year.
All is fair in the current 'soft wars' and premature announcements are low
down the list of marketing weapons currently being deployed by all the
participants.
In March, for example, a group of Microsoft's main rivals banded together to
announce a possible, final solution to the problem of the many different
versions of Unix in anticipation of the final arrival of Windows NT. IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun, Unix Systems Laboratories and Santa Cruz Operation -
all formerly in different factions of the Unix camp - said that they would
conform to a Common Open Software Environment specification.
Microsoft was conspicuously absent from the party - a factor which leaves
Cose lacking in credibility. Microsoft is, after all, the world's biggest
supplier of open software environments.
Although Mr Gates may have overstated its significance, Windows NT will
certainly mean change for the biggest single constituency in the computer
industry: tens of millions of users of MS/DOS-based personal computers.
It is more than a replacement for MS/DOS and Windows 3.1. Windows NT gives
Microsoft a product specifically to compete in the mid-range and enterprise
systems market against Unix and IBM's OS/2. It is designed to use the
so-called client-server architecture, a technique for distributing functions
across a network of many different computers.
Microsoft aims to extend the client-server principle from the most humble
desktop 'client' computer up to the new high-performance reduced instruction
set computers (Risc). It is working with Digital Equipment to build systems
based on DEC's Alpha Risc, for example.
The combination of Alpha's advanced architecture and Windows NT could
challenge even the largest mainframe systems on both performance and
function. If Windows NT succeeds, Microsoft may come to dominate the entire
software market.
But the question remains whether Microsoft can convince the market that it
has got certain important components in the NT 'family' right. The
networking component, in particular, will come under close scrutiny.
Microsoft has made several attempts to break into the market for PC
networking software, but to no avail.
While it seems unlikely that Microsoft will lose its grip on desktop
computers, it faces a real challenge in the networking market from Novell -
which currently dominates with NetWare.
But Novell, too, has had its failures. Its attempts to break into the
desktop operating system market - by taking over Microsoft's former rival
Digital Research - have had little impact.
The most likely resolution to the conflict is that the two companies will
continue to dominate their respective markets and be forced to combine their
efforts.
Mr Dan Kikinis, president of California-based Oakleigh Systems and the
designer of Elonex's range of PCs, says: 'Microsoft has not been very
successful in the Lan market and Novell is not really successful in the
operating systems market. The two will have to work together whether they
like it or not.
'Windows NT needs another year before it will make any real impact. It will
be difficult for Microsoft to get users to change how they work - and Novell
is still well ahead in networks,' he adds.
So it will be some time before the jury of the marketplace reaches its
verdict on Mr Gates's latest brainchild.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (9): Mid-range Unix faces a
crunch - The prospects for the main operating systems strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year may be the turning point for Unix, the computer operating system
developed more than 20 years ago by the US telecommunications giant AT&amp;T.
Technical development of Unix will soon fall under the control of PC
networking specialist Novell following its takeover of Unix System
Laboratories (USL). There is growing interest in 'downsized' open computer
systems based on Unix and a renewed sense of unity among Unix suppliers.
This should mean that Unix will, at last, find a respectable place in
commercial computing as an open foundation for portable applications which
can run on many different computers.
There are still doubts, however, and Unix's future may not be as rosy as
many of its advocates think. The market it serves - so-called mid-range
systems - has become a target both for large systems suppliers coming down
from mainframes and for personal computer suppliers moving up from the
bottom. It has, therefore, attracted alternatives. Operating systems
software such as Unix is pivotal because it provides the foundation for
applications.
IBM, for example, offers its AS/400 minicomputer with its own operating
software and its larger PS/2 personal computer systems running the OS/2
operating system. Needless to say, IBM also supplies AIX, a version of Unix
for its RS/6000 workstations.
Last month Unix came under attack from Microsoft with launch of Windows NT,
yet another potential alternative for mid-range computing.
Despite these challenges, Unix has a proven record of survival. It was
ignored by all except academics and researchers until a decade ago, when it
became closely bound to the cause of open systems. Since then, it has almost
become synonymous with 'openness'.
Unix is relatively easy to move to new computers - making it popular with
the new minicomputer manufacturers which emerged in the 1980s. Sun
Microsystems, Pyramid, Sequent and others took Unix off the shelf and
tailored it to their hardware, rather than face the expense of building an
operating system from scratch.
There were other factors. To sell their hardware successfully, manufacturers
must offer appealing software applications. Unix has them by the hundred
and, theoretically, they can work on any computer which supports Unix. In
practice, things are not this simple and applications often need 'tweaking'
to work on a different version of Unix. But this is still much less costly
than attempting to move, say, an old IBM mainframe application to a Digital
Equipment or Hewlett-Packard environment.
Unix has other virtues. Until recently, its technical development was under
the control of AT&amp;T which, as a telecommunications company, had no axe to
grind in the computer market. Following an unsuccessful attempt to attack
IBM in the mid-1980s with its own Unix-based computers, AT&amp;T has posed no
real threat. This meant that Unix was mainly free of hardware manufacturers'
influence and was able to develop along 'open' lines.
Through the 1980s, Unix suffered from fragmentation as manufacturers
'enhanced' it to suit their own hardware - making it difficult to move
applications without changing them. This undermined the open principle to
some extent and led to a succession of agreements and rival alliances aimed
at producing a single Unix specification.
At the start of the 1990s, tough market conditions helped force Unix
suppliers together and, in March, they announced support for the Common Open
Software Environment, a blueprint for single Unix standard. But this
new-found unity may owe as much to the imminent threat of Microsoft and
Windows NT as it does to any new sense of co-operation between rival
hardware builders.
Microsoft has recognised that the main market for future mid-range systems
will come from current MS/DOS PC users. They will be more inclined to
migrate to Windows NT, which offers them some continuity, than to a version
of Unix or IBM's OS/2. While this is unlikely to affect Unix's aspirations
in the market for 'downsized' systems, it will not help it gain the critical
mass it needs to dominate the mid-range.
However, Mr Neal Waddington, vice-president in charge of Tandem Computers'
Unix operations, sees a good future for Unix in the downsizing market: 'The
functionality gap between Unix and other proprietary systems is closing.
While Unix is not completely open, from a customer point of view, it's good
enough,' he says.
'Customers are looking for the break-up of the vertically-integrated
proprietary systems so they can buy best-of-breed products at every level,'
Mr Waddington adds.
He sees Novell's takeover of USL as 'very positive. It will lead to faster
convergence of a standard at the binary level. This means we can have a Unix
standard that we can add value to - rather than trying to add standards to
our systems,' he says.
He acknowledges, however, that Windows NT will be attractive to some
customers - though he sees it making its mark on the desktop 'client' rather
than in the back-end 'server' systems.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (8): A struggle for dominance
 -The prospects for the main operating systems strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE end of the decade, most personal computers will be attached to a
network of one sort or another. Many will be attached to local area
networks, so they can share resources, support 'group working' applications
and connect personal computers to large corporate databases.
Like any other, networks of personal computers need a controller - a sort of
telephone exchange - to make sure that messages get to the right
destination, cope with hardware breakdowns and maintain security.
Personal computer networks are controlled by software in the form of a
network operating system. In the same way that an operating system such as
Microsoft's MS/DOS looks after the complexities of operating a personal
computer, network operating systems control the flow of traffic through a
network.
It follows that the developers of what becomes the dominant network
operating system will be assured of a lucrative market well into the next
century.
In pole position is the Utah-based software developer Novell with its
NetWare package. Over the past 10 years Novell has successfully seen off
sustained attacks from its biggest rivals - IBM and Microsoft - and driven
at least one potential competitor - 3Com - out of the networking software
market.
More recently, it bought out Digital Research - Microsoft's one-time rival
in the PC operating system market - and formed Univel, a joint venture with
Unix Systems Laboratories (USL), to market Unix software. Novell is now on
the verge of completing a takeover of USL, which will give it effective
control of the Unix operating system.
Apart from its abortive merger with Lotus Development in 1990, Novell has
made all the right moves. It is well-placed not only to continue to dominate
the network software market, but also to challenge Microsoft's dominance of
the broader PC systems software market.
Not surprisingly, Microsoft is keen to extend its sphere of influence beyond
the confines of single, stand-alone personal computers. It wants a slice of
the network operating system market and has struggled - so far in vain - to
oust Novell. Microsoft's Lan Manager software, which is also the original
basis of IBM's OS/2 Lan Manager, has failed to appeal to PC network builders
 -partly because of technical problems and delivery delays.
The recent launch of the Windows NT operating system, which puts Microsoft
in a better technical position to compete with Novell, has raised the heat
of the battle.
Windows NT is a gamble for Microsoft. It is much more than a replacement for
its top-selling Windows 3.1 PC software. It is also designed for use on the
high-speed reduced instruction set computers (Risc) being developed by IBM
and DEC. This is traditionally the territory occupied by Unix.
More important, it comes with a new networking product called Windows NT
Advanced Server. Although Microsoft has not given a definite delivery date
for the Advanced Server, it has priced it very competitively and aimed it
directly at Novell's NetWare.
Novell's interest in Unix through USL - in addition to the products it
inherited in the Digital Research takeover - give it the weapons to break
into Microsoft's market.
However, Mr Lalit Nathwani, NetWare product manager at Novell UK,
acknowledges Microsoft's strong position. 'Microsoft will dominate the
desktop - but not the network server,' he says.
'The market is looking for stability and proven, reliable networking. And
customers do not want to be locked into a specific product like Windows -
it's proprietary. We can take a more independent view. Unlike Microsoft, we
have no involvement in applications software and we are hardware
independent.'
He adds that users are looking for integration across networks and that
Novell's new involvement in Unix development will make this easier.
The key to Novell's strategy is the bringing together of Unix and Novell's
NetWare - a combination which could give Microsoft's Windows NT a run for
its money. The proven track record of both Unix and NetWare in their
respective markets gives them a clear advantage.
But Unix has suffered from a lack of standardisation and confusion over the
'front-end' interfaces for applications programs and user interfaces. Novell
could put this right. It has succeeded in making Netware a standard for PC
networks and given application builders a fixed target to aim at.
It could do the same with Unix - although whether this will be enough to
triumph over Microsoft remains to be seen.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (6): Tower of Babel can be
surmounted - Interoperability, a new and inelegant word in the lexicon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past few years a new and rather inelegant word has entered the
lexicon of network computing - 'interoperability'.
Interoperability is a practical solution to the problem of ensuring that
different computer hardware and software components can work together across
a distributed network or interconnected networks.
If the computer industry had grown up in accordance with some monolithic
master plan, there probably would have been no need for any user to specify
interoperability; it could be taken for granted.
In reality, however, computer development has been driven by competing and
often incompatible technologies vying for customer acceptance. This has
resulted in a proliferation of rival computer architectures, operating
systems and software.
Within some segments of the industry, de facto standards have emerged. For
example Intel's chip architecture and Microsoft's MS/DOS have come to
dominate the personal computer market.
Even where no standards have emerged, there were relatively few problems,
provided machines based on different technologies functioned in isolation
from each other.
But today's end users want network systems which link together all their
information resources - regardless of the types of machine and technology or
their geographic location.
They want to squeeze more productivity out of their investment in IT by
hooking together desktop personal computers, high-power workstations,
departmental minicomputers and corporate mainframes locally, nationally and
internationally - and have them work in seamless harmony.
Since the 1970s, when networks first started to appear, there has been a
burst of activity as computers have been linked together to form local area
networks (Lans) and wide area networks (Wans). These in turn are being wired
together in a process called internetworking.
But this has led to technical headaches for many large customers whose
diverse IT operations have often grown up without any co-ordinated plan,
resulting in a wide range of often incompatible hardware systems and
architectures.
Indeed, the network hardware itself, including wires, connectors and
communications circuitry, coupled with the different ways of packaging and
transmitting data across Lans using various communications protocols, has
added another bewildering level of complexity and possible conflict.
The result has been described by some as 'an electronic Tower of Babel'.
There are, however, a number of possible solutions to these problems - steps
designed to ensure interoperability.
Perhaps the most obvious solution is to establish new hardware and operating
system standards. This is essentially what the various 'open systems'
standards, developed by the X/Open Group, the International Standards
Organisation (ISO) and others bodies, attempt to achieve.
Open systems work to a common specification and therefore achieve
interoperability by definition.
Equipment that complies with open systems standards can easily be connected
into communications networks and has the capacity to run operating software
and applications from any supplier obeying the open systems rules, rather
than manufacturers' proprietary ones.
Open systems standards are now widely accepted across the industry, although
some hardware manufacturers are still less than wholeheartedly enthusiastic
about implementing them because of heavy investment in their own designs.
But there is another important reason why even if open systems standards are
the long-term solution to securing interoperability, shorter-term
alternatives are also needed.
Many corporate customers cannot switch over all of their IT operations in
one jump, Even if they could, they probably would not want to. Such a move
would entail the unacceptable costs of abandoning proprietary computer
systems and expensive software.
For this reason, it is often suggested that open systems are most suited to
new applications, and that computer systems based on proprietary designs
will still be required to support current applications.
Even so, in the age of computer networking, these systems must at least be
able to work with others. Therefore manufacturers have adopted a number of
other approaches to make their proprietary systems interoperate with others.
Some vendors such as DEC, Groupe Bull and Hewlett-Packard have been pushing
their systems increasingly towards 'open systems' by changing their
operating software to conform more closely to the standards.
Similarly, the main network management software products, such as IBM's
Netview and similar packages from HP and Sun Microsystems, are moving
gradually towards Open Systems Interconnection while the SNMP (Simple
Network Management protocol), supported by the Internet organisation, has
become a de facto standard used by those wanting to integrate their Lans.
Other equipment manufacturers, including Apple, have accommodated other
systems within their own proprietary designs. As Apple's current UK
advertising campaign emphasises, Macintosh computers can now exchange data
files with MS/DOS personal computers, run MS/DOS programmes using 'Soft PC'
software and connect with PCs over a network.
Meanwhile IBM's strategy for delivering 'interoperability' has necessarily
been more complex. By the 1980s it was making seven incompatible computer
families but has since taken a number of steps to help its own, and other
vendors,' machines interoperate.
Among these, IBM in 1987 announced a plan called System Applications
Architecture (SAA) to enable its PS/2 personal computers, System/38-AS/400
minicomputers and its System/370 mainframes to be linked together more
easily.
All used IBM's long established Systems Network Architecture (SNA) for their
communications infrastructure. But each of the three used different
operating systems, different command and control interfaces and different
programming languages for their applications software.
Since SAA was launched in 1987 IBM has extended its specifications to
include many open and de facto industry standards in order help its systems
interoperate with others.
Last year, IBM announced its new Blueprint for Networking, which redefined
SNA to include many open systems specifications. Meanwhile, many IBM SNA
features have become de facto standards with the open systems stamp on them.
Although there are still problems in linking together proprietary systems,
Mr David Taylor, senior industry analyst with Dataquest, says most
manufacturers 'have worked hard to test their systems with competitors'.
Novell, which dominates the Lan software market, began shipping NetWare SNA
Links last year, a program designed to enable International Business
Machines customers to connect geographically dispersed PC networks via
existing mainframe computer links.
Other software houses such as Borland International have also been working
to enhance interoperability by making complex client-server based networks
easier to manage and use.
For example, Integrated Database Application Programming Interface software
provides a standards-based method for integrating, manipulating and managing
data from different databases and on different operating platforms.
The growing need to hook together Lans has also spawned a booming business
for the manufacturers of the internetworking products such as 'routers',
'hubs', 'bridges' and 'communications servers' which also help provide
interoperability.
These are used to divide computer information into 'packets', regardless of
the data communications protocols, find the most efficient and economical
route to deliver the packets to their destination on the network, and assign
priorities to different packets, delivering the most urgent ones first.
Such companies as Cisco, 3Com and Wellfleet which manufacture routers, and
Synoptics, a leading vendor of internetwork hub products, have all been
growing rapidly in recent years as a result of the increasing demand for
internetworking.
The age of isolated proprietary systems is over and as the trend towards
net- working accelerates, the need for inter- operability will grow. This
will mostly be satisfied by the continued shift towards open systems
hardware and software standards.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (7): The prize groupware
delivers - The effect is of gathering what everyone in a team knows in one
room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupware - software that runs across a network, co-ordinating the work of
individuals within a team - is the current buzzword in PC-based computing.
Regardless of distance, each member's files are constantly and
simultaneously updated. Groupware reproduces electronically the effect of
putting everyone together in the one room.
It is impossible to discuss groupware without studying Lotus Notes. With
500,000 licences sold worldwide, Notes has defined the groupware market. But
the phenomenal success of Notes has obscured some networking issues. Until
the very latest release, each sub-set of up to 50 users required a dedicated
PC server running IBM's OS/2 operating system. This is not the first choice
of many network developers, who have to wait until later this year for the
Unix operating system release.
And while Notes has flown the banner of groupware, the idea of a
constellation of users hanging off a network but working to a common goal
has been around for a very long time. Intergraph, a manu- facturer of
engineering work- stations, has been selling a file-sharing facility called
Microstation for seven years. At Pounds 3,000 a licence, Micro- station is
targeted firmly at engineering professionals.
Microstation allows architects, structural engineers and cabling planners on
a construction project to view each other's files as the building
progresses. Running under Unix, Dos and Microsoft Windows operating environ-
ments, Microstation is more flexible in networking options than Notes.
The UK arm of international engineering firm Ralph M. Parsons uses
Microstation to co-ordinate work on designing chemical processing plants. Mr
Brian Dowling, head of computer integrated eng- ineering at Parsons in
Brentford, West London, explains that a formidable array of protocols is
employed in the company local area network.
With traditional PC Lans such as Ethernet, market standard network software
from Novell and Unix Lan programs, Parsons can only use groupware that will
run happily over a multi-protocol network. For the time being, that rules
out Notes.
So if groupware was propelled to prominence by Notes, the idea, if not the
buzzword, already existed. Mr Dowling says he already has 'the ability to
overlay another design file on top of your desk file, allowing team members
to see layers of information.' Netware is IT industry jargon to describe
such products as Microstation.
With a spectacular sales curve, Notes has attracted keen supporters. What
Notes has done, say its adherents, is cut out a significant amount of
unnecessary data duplication on networks.
Mr Jim Chapman is the managing director of Triangle, a Bournemouth-based
systems house that specialises in Lans. Installing Notes at Triangle has led
to significant savings, he says. By pushing files across the network,
constantly saving and relabelling, conventional Lans absorb huge amounts of
data storage space, he argues. Notes is far more economical in that it keeps
the one file running, and does not waste space by applying a number of
formats to files.
'Networks encourage file replication, they become data dustbins. Notes
compresses data, strips out the formating and rubbish that other products
put onto the file.'
Triangle needed Pounds 30,000 worth of hardware to function as a network
engine on its own Lan before Notes arrived. Mr Chapman boasts that the data
economy of Notes means he can run the network off Pounds 6,000 worth of
equipment. In a 60-strong company that is a significant saving. Triangle now
sells Notes licences.
Notes can cut back on one aspect of network costs. It offers every user the
chance to write applications. This is a big step in terms of user-
friendliness and decentralising power. But it can encourage staff to waste
time and resources.
Mr Michael Chapman Pincher organises the Lotus Notes User Group and has
implemented Notes at SMI, his North London marketing services group. He
warns that user enthusiasm can prove wasteful. 'Most Notes sites are
graveyards of applications that died because they were found to be
unusable.'
However, in the present- ation-orientated world of marketing Notes has
proved vital. 'For a paper based information organisation like SMI, it has
become a valuable business asset because it's so easy to lose track as the
draft of a proposal progresses.'
Saunders Sobell is a London law firm with a mission to prise paper out of
the lawyers' hands. The idea is to put every step of casework on a network
of PCs and tie the work process together. Computer services group ITnet has
been appointed to handle the introduction of Notes with a Pounds 600,000
contract. This involves installing a Lan and ensuring that Notes takes over
the legal paper mountain.
Mr Jeffrey Tyrrell is IT partner at Saunders and his job is to make sure the
network's 130 users are steered away from group- ware's profligate tendency.
All working applications will reside on desktop PCs while a 486-based server
is dedicated to handling network traffic. 'We're configuring the network so
it's difficult for people to come out of Notes. We don't want them going
away and fiddling in other parts of the system.'
Mr Tyrrell harbours no illusions about a paperless Law firm. 'I think
lawyers are wedded to paper.' But he sees the potential for a well- planned
Lan running groupware. 'What's exciting is being able to exchange so much
information,' he says. 'Law is about selling knowledge, but until now that's
been locked up in the minds of staff around the building.'
With groupware at hand, the computer network may be about to deliver a
powerful prize.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (4): Demand fears give way to optimism - A
tougher but still growing market offers fresh openings for alert traders /
Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past five years Mexico has been a paradise for exporters. An
inefficient local industry, low trade barriers, and an almost insatiable
demand for capital goods and consumer products has increased imports by some
300 per cent since 1987.
A decade ago many middle-class Mexicans shopped in the US, but since Mexico
has joined GATT and slashed quotas and tariffs, supermarkets and discount
stores have stocked a multitude of the latest imported consumer goods. To
survive fierce international competition, Mexican companies have bought
machinery and capital goods from all over the world.
But the party is now over as much of the demand for imports has been met.
And the government, worried about the country's ability to finance a
continuing import binge, has put the brakes on economic activity. It has
pushed interest rates to 8 per cent in real terms, is running a budget
surplus, and has even slapped administrative controls on imports such as
British beef and tariffs of up to 1,000 per cent on Chinese goods.
Importers are therefore feeling the pinch, even though they remain
optimistic about long-term export prospects. 'I am full of confidence about
the future, but I don't know how I am going to get through the next month,'
says Mr Bob Hickman, a British importer of diesel engines and oil-field
industry products for more than 20 years in Mexico.
In the first quarter this year imports grew by 10.3 per cent, against 20-30
per cent in each of the four quarters last year.
Compounding the short-term difficulties are age-old business problems, which
all potential exporters have to grapple with. Diplomats and businessmen with
experience in Mexico say that setting up business can be slow and
frustrating, red-tape pervades and corruption continues.
As and if the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is implemented,
such obstacles to exporting may disappear, with Mexico adopting many US
business practices. But Nafta poses its own problems for non-American
businesses, since they will face average tariffs of around 10 per cent, but
North American competitors will face none.
Nafta, however, should stimulate Mexican economic growth, pushing up overall
demand for consumer goods, increasing competition for industry, and boosting
demand for new machinery and technology. 'We expect a smaller participation
in a bigger market,' says Mr Hickman, 'and that's better than the current
state of affairs.'
Such optimism is shared by the British Embassy in Mexico, which has drawn up
a list of target sectors for British exports over the next few years. Given
Mexico's environmental problems, the embassy expects pollution control,
water and sewage equipment to offer much business. Two British companies,
North West Water and Severn Trent Water, having already won sizeable
contracts.
Car parts, educational equipment, textile machinery, and clothing could
present good prospects for exports. Mexico's car industry is expected to
flourish under Nafta, the government is giving education an equipment
overhaul, and inefficient textile companies are to buy new equipment to
compete effectively with US and Asian rivals.
But business managers warn that taking advantage of such opportunities is
more difficult than exporting to Switzerland, for example. Mexico's
transport infrastructure is woefully inadequate - it can take longer and
cost more for goods to reach their destination than in developed markets.
While infrastructure spending is now a government priority, and smart
four-lane motorways are being built, ports and railways have barely
improved.
Business culture is also different compared to Europe. 'It's not what you
know, it's who you know. You need to be able to find your way through the
maze of bureaucracy,' says one European commercial attache, echoing an
almost universally-held view.
Good contacts, diplomats and business managers can divulge details of bids
early, enable bid specifications to be tailor-made to requirements or made
incompatible with competitors' bids.
A UK-resident business manager who has done more than Dollars 100m of
business in Mexico and Latin America says: 'In Mexico a decision is often
based on who they know and trust. The technical committee can leak details
of what they are looking for, or withhold such information. It can always
influence the tender.'
For all these reasons, 'you have to be there yourself or have a local man
with an understanding of the market. If you could do it by fax I would be on
the beach,' says another European business manager in Mexico. The UK
business manager says corruption is no worse in Mexico than the rest of
Latin America, but, he adds, it plays a part in his government contracts.
'While I do not pay bribes 'our Mexican agents can share their commissions.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (3): Land of many export opportunities -
European and US companies are slow to move in on this dynamic region /
Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE

<TEXT>
A MALAYSIA-based executive of a German company looks out from his office
over the Kuala Lumpur skyline. 'I'm sure those skyscrapers were not there
last year,' he says. 'Every day this country grows some more; people in
Europe or the US just don't realise what is happening in this part of the
world.'
It is a familiar refrain. The Malaysian economy has grown at an annual rate
of more than eight per cent over the past five years. And south-east Asia is
one of the most dynamic economic regions in the world.
Japan recognised the region's potential long ago. But still only a
relatively small number of European and US companies have grasped the
opportunities offered by the area's soaring economic growth rates.
Buoyed by its economic success, Malaysia is pressing ahead with ambitious
development plans. It aims to be a fully industrialised country by the year
2020. In 1998 Kuala Lumpur plays host to the Commonwealth Games.
The dates signal many opportunities for foreign exporters and traders. But
companies should move quickly, whatever the sector:
Power generation: the lights have been going out in Malaysia in recent
months. Tenaga Nasional, the country's partially privatised electricity
utility, has seriously underestimated fast growing power demands - caused by
rapid economic growth.
Malaysia currently has an installed capacity of 5,600MW. The government
estimates that to keep pace with economic growth, power output has to expand
more than five times over the next 25 years, involving the expenditure of
MDollars 100bn (Dollars 40bn).
To avoid massive investments in power by the government, Malaysia has been
one of the first countries to invite independent power producers (IPPs) to
take part in the electricity industry. Foreign participation, in terms of
equipment, consultancy services or equity, is critical to the expansion of
the power sector.
Already Britain's National Power and Asea Brown Boveri, the European
engineering consortium, are involved in multi-million dollar joint venture
power projects. But other opportunities for exporters, whether in goods or
services, are available.
Oil and gas: government policy is to switch from oil to gas-fired power
generation. Extensive gas pipelines are being laid throughout the country.
This not only means opportunities for foreign energy companies, it also
offers openings for substantial sales of heavy equipment and other ancillary
products.
Malaysia is known in the oil industry as a tough customer: its production
sharing contracts are among the most financially stringent in the world.
But in order to encourage more exploration and drilling activity there are
signs that Petronas, the state oil company, is introducing more lenient -
and financially attractive - production sharing agreements.
Telecommunications: the government has recently moved to break up the
monopoly on telecommunications services enjoyed by Telekom Malaysia,
recently partially privatised. New rival networks are being set up. While
Malaysia's telecommunications industry has developed fast, there is still a
big market for imported high technology products and consultancy services.
Infrastructure: the array of infrastructure projects being undertaken over
the next few years is boggling to many observers. But the government is
adamant that airports, ports, roads and railways will all be built.
The big prize at the moment is the contract for the new Kuala Lumpur
international airport, to be built on a site 50km south of the capital. The
cost of the project, including a high speed rail link between the airport
and Kuala Lumpur, is estimated at MDollars 13.8bn.
An Anglo-Japanese consortium, including Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty
of the UK and Marubeni of Japan, has devised a masterplan which it thinks
could win a substantial share of the airport work.
But availability of British and Japanese concessionary finance is a key
issue. There are also suggestions that Malaysia might seek to link awarding
contracts to other issues - officials have signalled that in return for
contracts Britain should grant more access and pick-up rights to Malaysia
Airlines, the national carrier.
Plans are underway to modernise much of the national rail network. This
includes double tracking of lines stretching most of the length of
Peninsular Malaysia. A rapid transit system is planned for Kuala Lumpur,
which, in only a few years, has been transformed from a sleepy colonial
style city into a bustling - and traffic clogged - metropolis.
Sceptics point out that for all the discussion of the mass transit system,
little seems to have been done so far. There are also concerns about the
viability of government plans to make a privatised mass transit system
self-financing: many believe a degree of government financing is essential
on such projects.
Given the scale of infrastructure development - and the speed at which the
government wants such projects completed - there are many exporting
opportunities available.
But seeing is believing. 'Europe is so tied up in its own problems it
doesn't understand the potential out here,' says the German executive.
'People have to come here and look at things. Only then will they appreciate
the scale of development going on.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (5): The great enabler -
Client-server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH MASSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Trent Health Regional Services upgraded its financial systems recently,
it chose to move off its health authority's mainframe and implement
client-server software called Open 1 on a network of personal computers.
According to Ms Kay Dickinson, senior assistant director of finance at Trent
Services, Open 1 provides a more flexible approach to accounting systems, so
that she can get quicker and more relevant management information. Staff can
use familiar PC applications alongside Open 1, which itself has a friendly,
graphical user interface (GUI). The hardware to support the system can be
upgraded using off-the-shelf PC products and add-ons.
The icing on the cake for Trent Services is that by installing Open 1, it
will save money. For the same price as one year's maintenance charges on
Trent's mainframe accounting system, Trent Services has been able to buy a
new application. 'We have been able substantially to reduce IT overheads as
a result,' says Ms Dickinson.
The business benefits that Trent achieved by moving away from centralised
mainframe systems to a departmental application demonstrate why
client-server computing is taking off in a big way. But what is different
about client-server computing, and why are so many people talking about it?
Mr Mark Treveil, senior consultant with Hoskyns, the UK consultancy group,
says that flexibility is the key. 'Organisations can do things with
client-server computing that they could never have done with a mainframe,'
he says.
As well as being able to empower users by giving them the tools they need to
do their jobs properly (including the PC applications they have grown used
to), organisations which choose the client-server route find that they can
create systems and reports more easily. Rather than go to the data
processing department with a request for a report, users can create a new
view on existing data themselves. Corporate data is a resource to be tapped
and used in new and different ways by imaginative 'front-end' applications,
instead of part of a monolithic liability that constrains the business and
stops it from changing.
Another benefit of client-server computer systems is that they tend to be
built from industry standard components, such as Novell NetWare. As anyone
involved in manufacturing or construction knows, wherever standard
components are used, prices fall.
Galileo, which provides a worldwide booking service for air travellers, has
based its new client-server TravelManager system on standard components for
these very reasons. Instead of writing new client routines and screens, it
is making extensive use of tried and tested applications such as SunAccount
from Systems Union, plus Microsoft Word and Excel.
Of the two elements in client-server computing, the client can be a PC, a
Unix workstation or even a remote notebook computer. The server can be
another PC, a Unix box, a minicomputer, mid-range computer or mainframe. The
basic premise is that different parts of the application run on the platform
that best suits the job in hand.
The PC (or workstation) handles the GUI and low-level PC applications, such
as spreadsheets and small databases. The server looks after 'back office'
computing tasks, such as updating large databases, or sorting through client
records. The two elements are connected via the local and wide area networks
now commonly in use by most large organisations.
The way a client-server application works is that users request information
or data from their PC client, but actually receive it from a server. The
server could be in the same room, in a different part of the building, or
even in another part of the country. Clients can access multiple servers for
different information, but client-server software hides the downloading
process from those users. As far as they are concerned, the information that
pops up on their screen could have come from their own PC.
Client-server computing can be described as 'user-centric'. Processing power
is brought to the desktop, and applications are designed to serve the
business need. But that view of computing can create problems for those with
no experience of how to use client-server applications properly.
The fact that organisations are integrating multi-vendor components into one
computing infrastructure brings its own problems, according to Mr David
Taylor, senior industry analyst at Dataquest. 'Management of these systems
can be difficult,' he says. 'Organisations need to look carefully at the
impact of having so much data moving around the network, for example. A lot
of the pieces of the jigsaw are ready to be used, but you still need
somebody to put it all together.'
But the reason that some large client-server applications have failed
recently has less to do with technology and systems integration skills than
with business processes, says Mr Ian Faulkner, divisional director of UK
management consultancy OASiS. 'Just sticking a sexy front-end onto an old
system that supports outdated business processes is not going to make any
difference,' he adds. 'Client-server technology is a great enabler, but the
important thing is to understand how it can help your particular business.'
The message is that while client-server computing does provide measurable
benefits (open systems, cheaper hardware and software maintenance, more
flexible programming and system design, better usability, the ability to
carry on using familiar PC applications and GUIs), it should never be
implemented for its own sake.
In future, more vendors of financial and other corporate applications will
produce robust, reliable client-server versions of their software. Oracle,
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Compuware and others have already announced products that
will help users move into client-server computing. The new dedicated
management tools and operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT will
also move the whole client-server bandwagon a little further down the track.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (4): Why to buy is better -
Global networks / A difficult decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY organisations which are seeking to build global information networks
face a difficult 'buy' or 'make' decision in the near future.
The signs are that most will go for 'buy' rather than 'make'. The main
reason is that they believe this will be quicker, cheaper and easier.
That will be a reversal of what was the prevalent trend until recently. Most
large companies used to feel more secure owning and managing their own
networks. It took a lot of time, money and effort to set them up, but it
gave the users complete control.
Now many want to do 'one-stop shopping' for telecommunications services
worldwide. The arguments that have already convinced many users to outsource
computing services apply to telecommunications. Network design has become so
complex that many think it best to hand it over to experts on a fixed price
contract for several years.
Mr Pim Bilderbeek, manager of the European network research centre for
International Data Corporation, predicts: 'More will buy than make because
that way they will free capital for other purposes and be able to
concentrate on their core businesses.'
Just as important is that they will get rid of all the problems of
negotiations with a large number of equipment suppliers and maintainers and
with the national telephone companies of the countries in which they
operate.
These complex dealings have been the biggest hurdles for those companies
which have built their own global networks. When anything goes wrong on a
private network, it is often extremely hard to sort out who is responsible.
Another factor is that the technology is becoming obsolete so quickly that
users may prefer to leave it to service providers to keep up with all the
latest inventions.
For organisations seeking to do business in emerging regions such as eastern
Europe, setting up a network may be much harder than in the more
technologically advanced countries. Where cables are inadequate, they may
need to rely on service companies which can provide access to satellite
systems.
The expected switch to outsourcing is good news for the suppliers of managed
network services such as BT, Cable &amp; Wireless and Infonet.
These companies have been increasing their revenue from network services but
have had to invest so heavily in establishing global networks that few have
reaped profits in this sector so far. But the prospect of a rapidly growing
customer base should reassure them of the wisdom of their investment.
Mr Trevor Watts, marketing manager for network services at service provider
AT&amp;T Istel, says that global companies must ask themselves whether they want
to commit huge resources to running their own networks in every country.
He notes that to do so they must be able to cope with different technical
standards in each country, for instance for the new ISDN digital telephone
system.
Mr Peter Hickman, a senior business consultant with GE Information Services,
the leading supplier of electronic data interchange services, says it is now
extremely hard for even large companies to provide all the necessary
expertise and support for global networks.
But some large companies, notably the financial institutions, are still
reluctant to hand over all their communications requirements to service
providers because they are not convinced that managed networks are secure
enough for their sensitive data. Most of the banks use their jointly-owned
body, Swift, to perform their major network functions.
As banking becomes less of a retail chain and more of a network application,
the banks are increasingly concerned about the ability of other network
providers to come into their market. They may therefore try to become
network providers themselves. That already seems to be starting to happen at
some of the top European banks.
Both service providers and those who intend to build their own global
networks face some big technical challenges in keeping up with users'
demands. Most companies have allowed their networks to grow in a piecemeal
manner and have managed them only by firefighting problems as they occur
rather than by proper planning.
Mr Watts believes that part of the solution to global network problems will
lie in the new technologies of Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode.
Frame Relay promises to overcome the restriction on throughput of
packet-switched data networks based on the Consultative Committee for
International Telephony and Telegraphy X25 standard. It is starting to be
seen as a cost-effective solution by US multinationals, but European
companies have yet to be persuaded of its advantages. However, Frame Relay
still needs more monitoring and diagnostics features to be able to deliver
substantial benefits to users.
ATM is seen as the next step after Frame Relay in increasing the rate of
data transfer and integrating local and wide area networks. US
multinationals are starting to investigate ways of adopting ATM as a future
backbone technology for achieving a higher still throughput of data.
Frame Relay and ATM may be the key to providing the increased bandwidth
which global companies will require for multimedia applications involving
image transmission. They appear to be well suited to users who need to
transmit very large files of data in short bursts to remote sites.
Competition for global customers will become intense in the next few years.
Last month AT&amp;T launched a service in the Asia Pacific region called
'Worldsource'. It has created a set of partnerships with telecommunications
companies in other countries.
BT's recent announcement that it will take a 20 per cent stake in AT&amp;T's
rival MCI points in the same direction. Others will seek to do the same to
get a share of the growing market in international voice and data
communications.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (2): New block to growth in world trade -
Political moves to improve international market share may disrupt activity /
Economic Overview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   by JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two years of very slow growth, the recovery for the world economy
seems to be underway. But exporters continue to operate in some of the most
difficult trading conditions seen in the post-war period.
Developed economies are either on the verge of recession or are only just
emerging from it, making it difficult for exporters to gain buyers for their
goods. Only China, and surrounding countries in east and south-east Asia,
show signs of robust health.
The tough economic environment has in turn spawned a series of trade
disputes over issues like tariff barriers, dumping and subsidies which might
yet turn into an all-out trade war between the three main trading blocks.
Above all, as nations seek to make their goods more competitive, they have
allowed their currencies to devalue as a means of fostering export growth.
But acute exchange rate volatility has made it harder for traders to predict
the value of their export earnings, however good their sales performance.
The problems should not, however, be exaggerated. The economic environment
is not as threatening as it was in the recession of the early 1980s. Then,
world import of goods contracted in volume terms. By contrast, figures from
IBJ (Industrial Bank of Japan) International show that the volume of world
imports continued to grow last year by 4 per cent year on year.
But there has been a qualitative deterioration in trading conditions. And
exporters are asking whether changes in the world economy and politics are
about to make those conditions worse.
The prospects for economic recovery in the developed world are patchy. The
brightest hopes lie with the US, Japan and the UK, which have pursued
policies of sustained low interest rates to stimulate credit expansion.
These economies will enjoy positive growth this year, but on what scale is
uncertain. Despite an annualised growth rate of more than 4 per cent in the
last three months of 1992, the US recovery stalled in the early part of this
year, restrained by a low savings rate and poor consumer confidence.
The UK faces similar problems, as households try to restructure their debts
following the fall in house prices in the last three years. Japan's economy
has been boosted by successive cash injections, which should boost growth to
1 1/4 per cent this year.
But here, too, the decline in asset prices - particularly property prices -
has been big enough to lower profits and weaken confidence.
But the plight of these economies is not as bad as that facing Europe and,
in particular, Germany.
The cost of German reunification continues to take its toll: German GDP is
expected to contract by 2 per cent this year, with some economists seeing no
signs of recovery before 1995. And as long as France and the Benelux
countries tie their economies to Germany, their prospects look almost as
bleak.
If the weakness of the real world economy has made it difficult for
exporters to find new markets, government policies may exacerbate matters.
The recession has coincided with attempts by governments to reduce the huge
budget deficits incurred in the 1980s. But such policies could threaten the
speed of recovery.
In the US, UK and some European countries, consolidation programmes are
slowly being implemented, keeping taxation high and reducing public
spending. In Germany, the budget overhang extends beyond the Finance
Ministry's earlier predictions, with the latest projection put at DM70bn
this year.
As governments tighten domestic spending, they hope that export-led growth
will help them to emerge from recession. That is why they have indulged in
currency devaluations which aim to make each country's goods more
competitive, but which will make price-setting for individual traders very
difficult.
Exchange rate manipulation will remain in vogue. The UK government is
believed to have kept a lid on sterling at DM2.50 to the D-Mark, by selling
the currency, as a means of increasing the competitiveness of British goods.
The Clinton administration has also committed itself to reducing Japan's
large merchandise trade surplus by subtly advocating a devaluation of the
dollar/yen exchange rate. Sweden and Finland have also carefully avoided
re-pegging their currencies to the Ecu, because the devaluation of their
currencies has helped boost the competitiveness of their wood and paper
industries.
One unanswered question, however, is whether France, Denmark and the Benelux
countries will continue to peg their currencies to an over-valued D-Mark,
pricing their traders out of many markets.
Amid the economic gloom in Germany, the Bundesbank has gradually reduced its
short-term interest rates. But the central bank remains concerned at the
threat of imported inflation and the depreciation of its currency. If German
monetary policy is not eased aggressively in the second half of this year,
exchange rate mechanism tensions could re-emerge.
In the longer term, the greatest threat to the trading environment comes
from government attempts to establish trading blocs as a means of securing
their share of international markets.
Central to this issue is the US - the driving force behind the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - which appears increasingly to favour a more
protectionist stance on trade issues.
The Clinton administration has taken an aggressive attitude towards Japan's
visible trade surplus. The recent signature of the North America free trade
agreement with Latin American states also underlines Washington's commitment
to regionalised trading.
All-out war between the three blocs - the EC, Nafta and the south-east Asian
bloc - can still be avoided. But the US and Japan appear determined not to
engage in negotiations on the reduction of the Japanese surplus.
US and European exporters are concerned that the creation of trading blocs
will reduce their access to the economies of south-east Asia and the Pacific
Rim, which are growing at a far stronger pace than more developed countries.
The comparison between these economies and the rest of the world is
startling. While Europe moves into recession, Chinese GDP is set to grow
this year by 12 per cent. The comparable figure for Thailand is 8 per cent
and South Korea 6 per cent.
However, Japan is the main beneficiary of the transfer of technology and
capital goods to its own region. In 1992, the Japanese trade surplus to
south-east Asia was Dollars 47bn, up from Dollars 37.4bn the previous year.
This trend indicates that the formation of large trading blocs is set to
continue. But, in the long term, such blocs lead to trade diversion not
trade creation, bringing an overall decline in economic growth. The trading
environment will move into structural decline if protectionism makes a full
return to nations' agendas.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (2): Radio links may spur
identity crisis - Local area networks are commonplace. But they are
challenging and can be costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Local Area Network (Lan) is a fact of life in any organisation faced
with the need to tie PC users together. But while the Lan has become
commonplace, it still throws up technical and business challenges.
The very fact that computer networking is now taken for granted contributes
to the growing cost of keeping Lans up and running.
One recent study com- missioned by Computervision Services suggests that as
much as 17 per cent of IT expenditure is now swallowed up in supporting Lans
after installation. But the same survey found that forward planning of Lans
has a low priority. Fellow networking contractor 3Com investigated its
market and concluded that the happy vision of a global computing environment
with companies linked through a series of seamless networks remains a
high-tech myth.
The manufacturing and finance sectors have come to rely heavily on Lans. But
3Com's research indicates that while some 70 per cent of Lan users in those
sectors planned to increase data communic- ations, only one quarter of large
organisations are foll- owing a clear networking strategy.
Naturally, contractors in the field are keen to highlight the benefits of
hiring their services. But confusion over the future of networking is due to
more than inadequate strategic thinking. The fact is that the Lan itself may
soon face an identity crisis.
For a decade, a Lan has consisted of physical connections between PCs and
software governing the exchange of data. With the emergence of multimedia
technology, the Lan is suddenly required to transmit sound and video images.
The Lan standards of token-ring and Ethernet are not at their best in this
environment.
Of course, IT manufacturers with an investment in multi- media have an
answer. They propose abolishing the kilo- metres of wiring that charac-
terise building-wide Lans and introducing radio links. If binding PCs
together via radio waves seems obvious, the reason it has taken so long to
arrive is mired in radio frequency regulations. With the liberalisation of
telecoms, previously restricted frequen- cies are being made available.
NCR, owned by US telecoms giant AT&amp;T, has pitched in with Wavelan. This is a
net- working scheme using spread spectrum, a microwave type radio
transmission favoured by military raiding parties behind enemy lines. The
attraction is that PCs can be held centrally, dispensed for a particular
project and used in a Lan without planning out and installing wiring. Mr
Simon Goodwin, NCR's architecture consultant, calls it 'deliver and drop
technology'.
With a Wavelan card fitted into a standard PC, the service costs Pounds 675
a connection. Mr Goodwin concedes that the delivery rate of data cannot
compare with Ethernet but says the difference becomes apparent only with
intensive work by a large user com- munity.
Olivetti's foray into wireless Lans is termed Net3, a mathematical reference
to three-dimensional, cubed space. This relies on Digital European Cordless
Telecom- munications. Radio relay points act as Lan hubs, joining up systems
over a 50-100m radius. Net3 costs Pounds 1,000 per user.
Mr Wynne Davies, product marketing manager, agrees that intensive use
creates problems, but says this can be overcome by installing more external
radio points. 'The advantage of Dect is that it will support voice. It's
very much a multimedia protocol.' Mr Goodwin claims this is Net3's weakness.
'Dect was developed for voice, not data.' Whatever their differences over
protocols, both companies recognise retail sites and institutions that
frequently reconfigure office space as potential converts to radio- based
Lans.
The European Space Agency has tried out Net3 to back up computers outdoors
and at temporary sites.
Mr Adrian Ridley-Jones, a senior consultant at systems house Logica, has
assessed both systems. He stresses that for intensive processing a
conventional Lan configured to cope with masses of data is still the best
route. 'For something like credit card processing you need the equiv- alent
of a big fat pipe, not the narrow bandwidth of radio.'
Mr Ridley-Jones identifies the hidden costs of keeping conventional Lans up
and running as a more immediate issue. Best-selling Lan products from
suppliers such as market leader Novell can lead to difficulties as the
system expands to cope with more use and users. 'These networks can be
incredibly expensive and difficult to manage when you start taking on
support staff.'
Mr Peter Steggall is head of IT strategy and planning at NatWest Life.
Launched on January 4 as a life insurance, pensions and unit trust operation
within the NatWest group, this organisation has formidable networking
requirement. NatWest Life has already spent Pounds 40m on com- puter
systems. A Unisys main- frame is tied via commun- ications processors to a
central data-processing Lan that can talk in turn to PC workstations
configured in a series of Lans.
Network growth is a big issue, Mr Steggall concedes. 'We've got servers all
over the place and no one is looking after them. We need very sophisticated
network management software to keep the whole system running.' With the
decline of the all-powerful data-processing centre and rise of decentralised
computing, some drawbacks have emerged. 'The environ- ment is not as
reliable as the old DP centre set-up.'
NatWest Life has called in consultants Hoskyns to cope with network
maintenance on a Pounds 500,000 a year contract. The effort of keeping up
with technical developments was not worth doing inhouse. Hoskyns is under
strict orders. 'The criterion is not just to deliver the service but to
improve it over the years as new Lan techniques emerge.'
Radio-based Lans are a possibility, says Mr Steggall. He forecasts the need
to incor- porate yet more capacity into Lans to cope with multimedia images.
But after the furious spread of Lans over the last decade, he is wise to be
cautious, preferring to learn from other's mistakes. 'We're not going to be
on the bleeding edge of technology.'

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (3): Downtime goes up as
networks expand - Network managers are finding that the problems of control
have multiplied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MORE personal computers, servers and printers have been added to networks
and applications have become larger and more complex, downtime has been
growing steadily .
A US survey by Gallup for Computer Reseller News last year found that the
average large company suffered four hours of downtime a week - almost double
the figure shown in research two years earlier.
At a seminar in April Mr Enzo Torresi, president of the superserver maker
NetFrame, forecast that average downtime would rise to five hours a week
this year.
The survey results refer to local area networks. On wide area networks the
figures are likely to be considerably higher.
Such a level of downtime represents a huge loss of productivity,
particularly when it affects organisations which rely on online systems such
as banks, airlines and manufacturers. For them 99.99 per cent availability
is just not enough; it needs to be 99.999.
The problem seems likely to worsen, because surveys show that users plan to
add more hardware and software to their networks without adding to their
network management resources.
Mr Jim Pante, European managing director of Network General, a vendor of
software tools for network management, says that most users spend only 2-3
per cent of their information technology budget on network management,
whereas 10-15 per cent is needed.
Most large companies in Europe and the US at present spend only Pounds
15-75,000 a year on network management tools. They do not expect to increase
that figure by much, nor to hire more network managers.
Mr Pante says more planning is necessary. 'Users need to lay down basic
network requirements for availability and response times and then monitor
any events that may put those targets at risk.'
Users' expectations of what networks should be able to handle have grown
faster than their adoption of network management systems and of the
capabilities of those systems.
Mr Paul Trowbridge, UK marketing manager for the network products company
Synoptics, says that most people underestimate what is involved in network
management. He attributes this to a lack of skills among network managers
who are under so much pressure that they do not get adequate training and
often adopt a naive 'tick list' approach to purchasing software tools.
The arrival of a new gener- ation of applications, includ- ing multimedia
programs, could compound the problems. Such applications will con- sume far
more bandwidth than current systems; therefore demand for bandwidth will
need to be closely monitored and controlled.
One of the answers may lie in expert systems. These are software programs
which use a specialised form of artificial intelligence based on sets of
rules devised by subject experts. A set of such rules could help to alert
network managers to anomalies and enable them to take a more pro-active
approach to monitoring.
Another part of the solution will come through the development of standards.
Most computer networks today comprise equipment from a number of different
sources, each of which requires its own management system. Network
management needs a standard which will allow heterogeneous machines to be
effectively monitored and controlled by a single software system.
Such a standard is beginning to emerge, but it could be several years before
it has stabilised. After that, it could be several more years before old
non-standard machines are phased out and replaced by others that conform to
the new standard.
In this f i e l d, a s in others, the industry has been torn between
official and de facto standards. A few years ago users and vendors were
looking to the International Standards Organisation's Open Systems
Interconnection model to provide them with official standards for
networking.
They pinned their hopes on OSI's Common Management Information Protocol. But
that required so many features that it has so far failed to win much support
from manufacturers.
Meanwhile, the rival Simple Network Management Protocol, supported by the
Internet organisation, appears to have overtaken it and is now close to
becoming a de facto standard.
However, SNMP has been criticised for allowing too many options for
implementation by product vendors and for lack of security. A new version of
the protocol, SNMP2, which should deliver both greater standardisation and
improved security, is expected to be built into equipment towards the end of
this year or early next year.
The Open Software Foundation's Distributed Management Environment (DME) is
now making the running as a standard architecture for the product vendors.
It will support the SNMP protocol and should help to make network software
more portable.
Mr Justin van der Lande, networks marketing manager for NCR UK, an AT&amp;T
subsidiary, says: 'Our difficulty is to know which standards to back.'
NCR's StarSentry, one of the leading network management products, already
has SNMP compliance and will add compliance with DME in its next release.
Though it has yet to achieve commercial success, StarSentry was rated best
network management product in a recent market report by consultancy
ButlerBloor.
Hewlett-Packard has recently announced enhancements to its market-leading
OpenView network management software which will take it in the direction of
centralised control of distributed systems. Ms Caroline Rowney, its UK
client-server programme manager, says that users wanting to migrate from a
mainframe environment to a distributed environment have been concerned about
a possible loss of control.
The latest version of OpenView also takes another significant step towards
the integration of system management with network management and thus
towards centralised control.
OpenView now seems to be on the way to becoming an industry standard, at
least in the open systems community, as it is being incorporated into DME
and into IBM's NetView products. Itis supported by around 170 partner firms
which have developed hardware and software additions to the system.
Whatever the industry standards turn out to be, networks of a few years
hence should be controllable from a single software system and therefore,
eventually, less subject to faults and crashes.

FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (1): Why exporting is in vogue - Governments
around the world perpetually exhort businessmen to export more. They are
right to do so, but not always for the right reasons / Comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHETHER a company is in the US, in Australia, in the Ukraine, or the UK, it
is being exhorted to export. Governments across the world appear to have
rediscovered exports as a kind of new panacea - the only route to
non-inflationary growth.
Governments have good reason for their exhortation, as economies across the
industrial world falter. Only weeks ago, the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development sharply reduced growth forecasts for
its 24 member nations to 1.2 per cent in 1993, down from 1.9 per cent
predicted just six months ago.
Of even greater concern is rising unemployment. The OECD expects
unemployment among its member nations to rise to 36m in 1994 from 35m this
year, climbing from an average of 7.9 per cent of the workforce last year to
8.6 per cent next year.
Even in the US, where there is every sign that companies are through the
worst of their recession, President Clinton has already voiced his concern
over 'jobless growth'. In Germany, with the economy expected to contract
this year by 1.9 per cent, unemployment is expected to rise sharply from 4m
this year to 4.5m in 1994 - about 11.4 per cent of the workforce.
Whatever economists say about 'jobless growth' being a good thing (it
suggests higher efficiency, and rising labour productivity), the politicians
are unanimous that the social and political dangers linked with rising
unemployment are too great to be dismissed so easily.
Fears remain strong that inflation has been held at bay rather than purged,
so the option of kick-starting the economy by stimulating domestic demand,
or by programmes of public spending, is a risky one. For governments in the
US, the UK or Germany, where public spending levels are already too high and
public debts have to be trimmed, domestic pump priming is not just risky -
it is untenable. At present, it is only Japan, with low inflation, and low
levels of public debt, that dares take the risk.
With problems so grave, and so many options effectively closed, it is not
surprising that exporting is in vogue: it can create new jobs; it can ease
balance of payments problems. At a more fundamental level, it can ensure
that companies remain competitive, by forcing them to be as efficient and
productive as exporters from other countries active in the same markets.
But it is naive to see exporting as so simple a panacea. First, most
exporters need to import many of the components they need for their
exportable products. This need not be a sign of weakness, as ministers often
suggest. Most of the world's large companies are now organised for
production on a global basis, with an international division of labour based
on a wide array of factors. For them, imports to and exports from a
subsidiary in any country are simply part of this process. Trade between
subsidiaries of the same parent company accounts for about 45 per cent of
all world trade.
Second, the obsession governments have with manufactured exports - with a
hint often that this is the only 'real' or virile trade - serves to suppress
the importance of trade in services. This deflects attention from the sector
that has grown most rapidly in recent years, both as an income earner and a
job creator.
Third, governments tend to forget that one country's exports are another
country's imports. Many in the US would argue that Japan's success as an
exporter has been at the expense of US companies, and that the imbalance
must be corrected as a matter of urgency if the international trading
environment nurtured over 45 years since the end of the second world war is
to remain stable.
It is notable, however, that it is in the fast-growing economies of east and
south east Asia, such as Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Korea, that least is
said about balanced trade: 'I'm not interested in balancing trade in any
bilateral sense,' says Victor Fung, head of Hong Kong's Trade Development
Council. 'Our aim is just to increase the total volume of trade. In the long
term, it is the size of the pie, not our larger share in it, that we must
focus on.'
This Hong Kong mind set is important to understand. It has made a tiny
colony of 5.6m people the world's 10th most important trading power. Mr Fung
talks not of exports, but of trade. Even more frequently he talks of 'value
added' - because it is this slice in the production process retained by the
Hong Kong economy that generates its wealth, and ensures full employment.
Interestingly, full employment has been maintained in Hong Kong even after a
10-year process during which a large part of its manufacturing industry -
ranging from electronics to toys and textiles - has left Hong Kong to
capture lower costs in mainland China. Hong Kong retains company headquarter
operations, provides design, quality control and marketing. It has
unashamedly become a services economy, and become as rich as - and in some
cases richer than - many EC member states in the process.
Mr Michael Heseltine, Britain's minister for trade and industry, or his
counterparts in Germany, France, the US or Australia, are not wrong to focus
on exporting in its own right. But they should not be praising its virtues
as a quick fix for a balance of payments problem.
Instead, they should recognise the virtues of exporting as symptomatic of
companies that are ready and willing to compete with the best in the world,
to match competitors' levels of productivity and efficiency, and to invest
in the research and staff skills needed to stay in the vanguard. High
salaries and a good quality of life would be the reward of such export
success - and they are unlikely to be sustainable without it.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Survey of Computer Networking (1): One stop that does it all
 -The growth of applications running on 'client-server' networks amounts to
a second computer revolution. Low-cost hardware and sophisticated software
have opened the way, while calls for greater business productivity are the
spur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is being described as the second computer revolution, the most profound
shift in the pattern of use of information technology since the advent of
mainframe systems in the 1950s.
Computers and telecommunications are merging to allow the creation of IT
networks that are narrow enough to serve a single department in a
corporation or as broad as a global enterprise. The key development is the
growth of applications running on 'client-server' networks, workstations and
larger computers linked together to process data co-operatively. This has
been made possible by improved local and wide-area communications and
cheaper processing power and memory on small computers.
Among the moves that suppliers are making which indicate that the networking
revolution is fully under way are:
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software house, this year
launched Windows NT, its next generation operating system. Windows NT, a
large and complex piece of software, is the first Microsoft operating system
designed for enterprise-wide computing. It competes not only with
International Business Machines' OS/2 personal computer operating system,
but also with MVS, IBM's flagship mainframe operating system.
Novell, the local area network (Lan) software supplier, acquired Unix
Systems Laboratories last year and forged an alliance with the database
vendor Oracle this year, in moves to consolidate the position of both
companies and fight the challenge from Windows NT.
Most significant of all, IBM, the stumbling giant of the computer industry,
established a client-server business unit, a startling change of direction
for a company whose business success has been based on centralised
mainframes.
There are equally significant moves on the telecommunications side of the
fence. The world's large carriers are increasingly concerned to offer their
large customers 'one stop' shopping in voice and data communications. The
range of activity is broad. AT&amp;T of the US, for example, is involved in the
development of 'personal digital assistants'. These inexpensive, hand-held
devices combine the functions of a telephone, computer, facsimile machine
and electronic organiser.
The scene is thus being set for a business environment where corporate
information is readily available to executives either in the office or on
the move.
Wireless communications is enjoying a new vogue. According to CSC Index, a
leading US IT consultancy, 'wireless communications is a technology in which
global players are making multi-billion dollar investments and forming
cross-industry alliances'. It says that cellular radio carriers in the US
alone have made more than Dollars 10bn in capital investments since 1984.
The business logic derives from the 'Negroponte Switch', the observation by
Prof Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Laboratory that communications to
people on the move should shift to wireless means, leaving television and
other transmissions to fixed targets to cables in the ground.
Olivetti of Italy has already announced a system for connecting personal
computers using radio frequencies rather than cables.
It is clear, therefore, that the scope of networking has changed over the
past decade. In earlier days the emphasis would have been on linking
mainframes and on standards contests such as the battle between IBM's
Systems Network Architecture and the world standards organisations' Open
Systems Interconnect.
Today the emphasis is on effectiveness; what makes the revolution possible
is a combination of low-cost computer hardware and sophisticated software;
what makes it necessary is a universal demand for greater business
productivity and competitiveness.
An example is Equipment et Composants pour L'Industrie Automobile (ECIA),
which is majority owned by Peugeot of France. It has established a
pan-European network of 10 sites running the IBM mid-range AS/400 system.
The network runs on IBM's SNA rules and is driven by an IBM mainframe based
at Audincourt near Paris. It is part of a ECIA project called 'Parler le
Meme Langage (Pamela)' which is being built to ensure that all parts of the
group work in the same way with standardised information and with objectives
and results which can be compared on the same basis. The key element is a
package called Data 3, manufacturing resources planning software written by
Hoskyns, the UK arm of Cap Gemini Sogeti of France.
Mr William McGilvray, supply manager at ECIA subsidiary HPC of Coventry,
explains: 'Under the old system, top management could not have looked at the
1992 devaluation of sterling and said: 'Let's put more work into the UK
because costs are lower there'. Now comparisons of this kind can be made
quickly and objectively.' Other motor manufacturers are installing similar
aids to productivity.
Why has computer networking assumed this new significance? The starting
point is today's business environment. Customers are demanding better and
more flexible service. They expect shorter lead times, improved quality and
responsiveness. IT networking, through electronic data interchange (EDI),
computer aided engineering (CAE) or group working can provide the means of
fast and flexible response.
The computer industry has been quick to coin expressions to describe the
essential features of the revolution: 'downsizing' - moving applications
from mainframe systems to less expensive but no less powerful microprocessor
based computers; 'client-server computing' - processing data on networks of
computers, some of which provide computing or data services to the network,
the rest serving as workstations; 'co-operative computing' where the network
functions as a single processing unit.
Among the companies which are helping to shape the new communications worlds
are, at the personal computer level, network operating system supplier
Novell, the market leader with NetWare version 4.0, Microsoft and Banyan. At
the local area network level, fast-growing hardware companies Cisco and 3Com
as well as Ungermann-Bass provide the essential hubs and routers for network
interconnection while suppliers of wide area networks include the
telecommunications companies AT&amp;T and BT. At the systems level computer
hardware and software vendors include IBM, Digital Equipment,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and Bull.
The aim of networking is simple: to enable computer users to have access to
information, applications software and computing resources without needing
to know where any of these are located. But there are dangers, not least of
which is the comparative novelty of the technology.
Prof Stephen Bradley of Harvard Business School sounded a powerful warning
recently: 'Competitors may invest first without fully understanding the
strategic implications or evaluating the financial impact of their
investment, and other firms may copy these investments lest they be left
behind in a rapidly changing industry', he wrote, arguing that many
companies were investing heavily in IT networking in the forlorn hope of
gaining significant advantages. 'Most firms', he concluded, 'do not realise
a competitive advantage from their investments and those that do find it
difficult to sustain.'
It is a damning judgment, but it echoes the concerns that managers have
frequently expressed over the difficulty of justifying investment in IT. The
answer, according to Prof Bradley, is to assess spending on IT and
telecommunications as part of a coherent business strategy; to view it as a
strategic necessity rather than an attempt to gain sustainable competitive
advantage.
Putting networks together is, in practice, hard work and the larger the
network, the more complex the problems. To judge from the enthusiasm with
which networks are being installed, the rewards seem worth the risk.
According to Mr Peter Wright, European director of Dell Computer's
integrated systems division, the number of personal computer local area
networks (PC Lans) grew by 33 per cent last year to 780,000. He says the
principal aim is not to save money through downsizing, but to gain greater
efficiencies in all parts of the business. In short, it is the essential
underpinning for business process re-engineering, today's shorthand for
rethinking a business from the bottom up.
With the growth of networking, the problems of network management have
expanded. It is now the single greatest concern of IT managers in larger
companies. The London consultancy Ovum forecasts that the market for
management frameworks will be worth nearly Dollars 900m in the US and Europe
by 1998.
Today, the concern is to manage a broad range of communications and
computing devices from a variety of suppliers distributed over many sites.
The more aware organisations are already looking beyond that to ways of
managing business applications - software that supports practical business
processes - across a diversity of networking technologies.

FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AGGRESSIVE start to yesterday's derivatives trading died away late in the
session and by the close the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was back to
the point at which it had started - at 2,919, Christine Buckley writes.
Traders focused on Thursday's Bundesbank meeting and the possibility of
further cuts in French interest rates. Suggestions of possible French
withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate mechanism also found credence.
Stock index futures gained added impetus from strength in the long gilt
market and German government bond futures. Some heart was also taken from
the strength of sterling.
But volume in the Footsie future was thin - about half that of an average
day - with just 5,728 contracts traded. The contract traded within a narrow
range of 13 points.
One analyst saw the fading of the futures contract as a reflection of a
market which had started buoyantly as news of the Baghdad bombing was
absorbed, only to fall back as other markets opened.
The closing quotation showed a premium of about 22 points to the cash
market, with the fair value premium at an estimated 11 points.
Traded options trod a similarly modest path path with turnover of 21,964.
The top performer was Amstrad with 3,323 lots traded. Hanson took second
place with 2,328 contracts traded.

FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Base rate hopes underpin share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT confidence stood up well in the London stock market yesterday to
the possible implications of the US air strike against Iraq, and share
prices responded strongly at first when sterling's strength gave fresh
impetus to hopes for a cut in domestic interest rates. However, with the
institutions still cautious, it was left to the stock index futures to
provide the lead and the stock market closed well below the day's best.
Equities opened nervously in London, although the firm performance from Far
Eastern markets had already indicated that the US missile attack on Baghdad
had not undermined the confidence of global investors. The reaction from the
US public to President Clinton's strong defence of the US action suggested
that Wall Street would also remain undisturbed by the unexpected turn in
events in the Middle East.
The London market soon turned its attention to the strong performance from
sterling which followed favourable analysis in the UK financial press. The
immediate view was that this would strengthen the chances of a cut in UK
base rates, and developments elsewhere in the currency markets focused
attention on this week's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy council.
In early trading, the FT-SE Index briefly regained the 2,900 mark with which
it jousted last week. But the initial advance of 16.3 points owed a great
deal to active arbitrage trading between stock index futures and underlying
blue chips.
Once the relative lack of underlying investment interest became evident the
equity market came off the top, halving its gain. A new upturn came,
however, when Wall Street opened, confirming expectations in London with an
opening gain of 21 Dow points. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at
2,897 for a net rise on the day of 9.5.
In addition to the arbitrage business in the blue chip stocks, there was
renewed activity in the second line stocks, often driven by recommendations
from London investment houses. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 10.8, closing
at yet another new peak of 3,223.9.
Trading in non-Seaq stocks jumped to around 67 per cent of the day's Seaq
total of 500m shares. On Friday, 509m shares traded through the Seaq
electronic network, representing Pounds 1.16bn in terms of retail or
customer business in equities.
Consumer and financial stocks were the chief beneficiaries of the renewed
base rate optimism. Store shares, hoping that their customers will spend
more readily if interest rates come down, were mostly firmer. Sector
analysts played an active role, with brewery stock downgraded by one leading
house.
Also moving higher were shares in the lending banks, where every reduction
in interest rates is regarded as easing the burden of bad debts still
weighing down bank balance sheets. But gains were small and the day's best
prices not always held at the close.
Pharmaceutical stocks, while under reduced selling pressure, remained under
the cloud of the bearish views shown by US investors over the past six
months. Zeneca, the new pharmaceutical group formed out of ICI's former bio
science interests, could make no headway now that the share placing
excitement has subsided.

FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tarmac wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac, the building materials and housebuilding group, attracted much
heavier than usual turnover of 6.4m amid a mixture of revived takeover
speculation and talk of profits upgrades and broker buy recommendations.
Bid speculation again centred on Minorco, the mining and minerals group
which comes under the control of Harry Oppenheimer's Anglo American/De Beers
umbrella, but was largely dismissed by building analysts.
Dealers said Cazenove, Tarmac's stockbroker, had turned a buyer of the
shares and increased its earnings forecasts for the company, although this
was not confirmed; Cazenove has a policy of not commenting on client
business. Tarmac shares settled 7 higher at 141p.
Northern Electric took up the running in the regional electricity sector's
'dividend race' increasing its annual payout by 15.6 per cent, the highest
so far in the sector. Northern shares jumped 6 to 514p on the news.
Seeboard, due to announce preliminary figures this morning and where the
dividend is confidently expected to rise by around 15 per cent to 19.8p,
moved up 7 to 510p. Eastern, reporting tomorrow, edged up 4 to 461p,
Southern, due on Thursday and expected to mount a strong challenge in the
dividend stakes, jumped 11 to 463p. London Electricity, reporting Friday,
gained 7 to 454p.
Although losses from Airtours were in line with market expectations,
investors were cheered by the group's recent aggressive acquisitive run
which yesterday culminated in the Pounds 20m purchase of a Welsh tour
operator. This follows the recent purchase of Hogg Robinson's retail
division and of the Pickford's chain.
However, the company were said to be looking to limiting analysts' upgrades
which were including the most profitable period for the new acquisitions.
Brokers were moving from profit forecasts of around Pounds 35m to Pounds
45m, buoyed by firm summer bookings and less talk of discounting. The shares
added 6 to 334p.
Other groups in the holiday sector also shone in sympathy. Owners Abroad,
which Airtours failed to land earlier this year, rose a penny to 98p, Euro
Disney 15 to 810p and Eurocamp 4 to 227p.
Weekend press comment over the business strategy at Thorn EMI helped the
shares gain 8 to 915p.
A profits downgrade by Hoare Govett saw Abbey National drift back 2 to 408p.
Hoare was said to have chopped its current year estimate from Pounds 670m to
Pounds 640m.
Barclays, on the other hand, edged up 4 to 470p with the bank thought to be
about to announce the name of its new chief executive. HSBC added 13 at 667p
following a strong performance by the Hong Kong stockmarket.
Royal Insurance was the pick of the composite insurers, the shares extending
their recent strong performance and moving further ahead to close 6 higher
at 304p.
Lowndes Lambert, due to announce preliminary figures this morning, rose 6 to
a record 379p.
A dull food retail sector was also put off by a rumour that one leading
securities house was considering downgrading the whole sector on the back of
low food price inflation. A combination of a broker downgrade, negative
press comment and profit-taking sent Asda retreating 2 1/2 to 72 1/2 p.
Tesco was said to be the subject of a downgrade from James Capel. The
company also issued a statement denying press speculation of a boardroom
rift. The shares firmed a half-penny to 215 1/2 p.
The surge in Great Universal Stores on the back of enfranchisement hopes
continued with the 'A' shares gaining 17 to 1780p.
There was talk of a pick-up in DIY sales in recent months. Kingfisher, owner
of the B&amp;Q chain, added 3 to 607p, as did Do It All partner WH Smith to
429p, while Boots gained 4 to 454p. Ladbroke, which runs Texas, climbed 3 to
179p.
In a quiet drinks sector, Grand Metropolitan benefited from a recommendation
in a US investment magazine. The shares added 5 to 434p. Comment on the
Greenalls bid for Devenish saw the former climb 4 to 358p and the latter
steady at 366p.
A confident statement from WPP raised its price by a penny to close at 87p
with 1.3m shares traded. Shareholders at the annual meeting heard that the
group was well poised to take advantage of a recovery and its worldwide
revenue in constant currencies was up 5 per cent over the past five months.
One media analyst said that it was the most bullish statement by the
advertising group in quite some time.
Elsewhere in media agencies, Acsis Group suspended its shares after their
steady drift had sent the price down to 1 1/4 p. It said it would make a
statement on refinancing and restructuring next month.
Witan Investment edged up 2 to equal the 1993 high of 197p following an
agency cross of around 7m shares, executed by Panmure Gordon, the
stockbroker, at 197p. Henderson Investment Trust Management issued a net
asset value of 226.4p a share for Witan.
DC Gardner shares jumped 10 to 51p after the egm voted to approve the
reorganisation moves.
IMI, meanwhile dropped 5 to 278p after a series of profits downgrades
instigated by a number of broking houses. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken lowered their
current year estimate from Pounds 72m to Pounds 68m.
British Aerospace, where the shares were poor performers and down around 6
per cent last week, staged a good rally, closing 7 higher at 395p as the
market adopted a more positive attitude to hopes of the sale of Tornado
aircraft to South Korea.
In the transport area, British Airports Authority jumped 18 to 731p after
talk of buy notes issued by James Capel and UBS.
The day's two debut stocks, Metrotect and Enviromed, kept up the run of
strong performances by market newcomers. Metrotect, the plastics group,
closed at 133p after turnover of 4.1m shares, while Enviromed settled at an
8p premium to its placing price of 110p.

FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome continued to under-perform the market and the
rest of the health and household sector, ahead of the challenge in the US
courts by two companies to Wellcome's patent on its anti-Aids drug AZT, or
Retrovir.
The court case, being heard in New Bern North Carolina and brought by two
generic drug manufacturers, Barr and Novopharm, is expected to last around
two to three weeks.
Although some analysts expect Wellcome to win the case, its shares are
expected to come under fire as bouts of uncertainty unnerve some
institutional holders of the stock.
US newspaper reports concerning AZT treatment also added to the general air
of uncertainty surrounding Wellcome. The latter's shares, down 4.5 per cent
last week, fell to 684p yesterday before stabilising and closing a net 9 off
at 688p. Turnover was an unremarkable level of 1.3m.

FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank deal doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTIONS IN the UK press that Rank Organisation was closer to selling its
stake in Rank Xerox brought a mostly sceptical response from leisure
analysts, although the shares reacted more favourably, gaining 16 to 796p.
Turnover was a healthy 1.5m.
The advance was helped by more speculative comment that if Rank were to sell
the Xerox stake, and also accept a long-rumoured offer for its film
division, then the company could be ripe for break-up. Some also suggested
that the Xerox stake sale, which could raise in the region of Pounds 1.5bn
and virtually wipe out the Rank group's debt, might also become a bargaining
tool in eliciting a higher price for the film division. Although Rank has
denied being interested in selling, analysts have put a figure of Pounds
400m on the film division.
However, more seasoned hands were dismissive of these suggestions and said
it would be some time, perhaps years, before Xerox would be in a position to
buy Rank's share. A spokesman for Rank declined to comment on the
speculation.

FT  29 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Further fall in bond yields
boosts stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FURTHER DECLINES in bond yields, which dropped to historic lows mid-morning,
helped US stocks post big gains across the board, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.31 at 3,530.20. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 4.25 higher at 451.85, while
the Amex composite was up 2.29 at 432.86, and the Nasdaq composite up 8.01
rose to 702.82. Trading volume on the NYSE was 242m shares, and rises
outnumbered declines by a ratio of more than two to one.
Once again, a buoyant bond market provided support for equities at a time
when the fundamentals for the stock markets are anything but positive.
Although concern about sluggish economic growth has undermined stocks, it
has provided a fresh boost to bond prices. Yesterday the benchmark 30-year
bond rose another  1/2 of a point, sending the yield down to 6.667 per cent,
the lowest it has been since 1977, when the Treasury began issuing 30-year
bonds on a regular basis.
Low interest rates cheered investors because they reduce the cost of
corporate borrowing and stimulate interest in equities, particularly through
the mutual fund industry, which has benefited from huge inflows of investor
cash ever since rates began to decline two-and-a-half years ago.
The political news was also positive for stocks, with investors welcoming
President Bill Clinton's decision to attack Iraq's intelligence headquarters
as retaliation for the alleged attempt to assassinate former President
George Bush. Analysts said that the missile strike on Iraq would revive
confidence in Mr Clinton.
Falling interest rates lifted bank stocks: Citicorp rose Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 30, Chemical put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 41 7/8 , Chase Manhattan
firmed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Banc One added Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 56 3/4 and BankAmerica rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 .
Brokerage companies, another sector which benefits greatly from falling
rates, were also higher. Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 80 3/4
, Morgan Stanley climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 68 1/2 and Primerica, which
owns Smith Barney Shearson, surged Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 .
Leading technology stocks were also in demand. IBM firmed Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 50 1/2 , Motorola added Dollars 2 at Dollars 88 1/8 , Digital
Equipment climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 , Unisys put on Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 12 1/8 , and Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 83
3/8 .
Northern Telecom crashed Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 in volume of 2.1m
shares as investors reacted to Friday's late profits warning from the
Canadian telecommunications group.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed sharply lower in relatively moderate trading, as
concerns about the earnings prospects of Northern Telecom sent the
telecommunications giant's shares tumbling.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 26.32
points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at 3,965.45. Declining issues outnumbered
advances 425 to 333.
Northern Telecom plunged CDollars 10 1/4 to CDollars 37 1/8 on volume of
more than 1.9m shares. BCE Inc., Northern Telecom's parent and the composite
index's most-heavily weighted stock, lost CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 44.

recover as Pacific Basin divides

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL nervousness was assuaged by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
resilience in Sunday's Tokyo municipal assembly elections, and share prices
rose 1.2 per cent on buying by public funds and dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 227.19 at 19,886.76 after a low of 19,675.13
and a high of 19,976.61. However, in spite of the market's strength, genuine
investors remained on the sidelines, and volume fell to 240m shares against
261m.
Gainers led losers by 754 to 260 with 149 unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 16.42 to 1,600.47, topping the 1,600 level for the
first time in eight trading days while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 1.69 to 1,209.91.
The Tokyo metropolitan election has been considered an indicator of voter
sentiment ahead of the July 18 parliamentary elections. In spite of
forecasts that the ruling LDP would be hit by the recent defections due to a
row over political reform, the LDP gained one seat to 44, while the Social
Democratic Party, the largest in opposition, lost over half its seats to 13.
The Japan New Party, a reformist group, increased its seats from 2 to 20.
Mr Alex Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that share prices
would move sideways with short term traders dabbling in incentive backed
issues. 'The political upheaval is all about finding a new structure, and
poses less risk to investors than change in ruling parties in other western
countries,' he added.
All sectors gained, with airlines rising 4.1 per cent on the higher yen.
Japan Airlines put on Y47 to Y790, with All Nippon Airways up Y30 to Y1,150.
Minebea, the ball bearings company, plunged Y30 to Y574 on reports on its
mounting loan guarantees to its troubled financial subsidiary.
Electricals were mixed on the higher yen. NEC fell Y2 to Y938, but Fujitsu
gained Y10 to Y738. Hopes of a higher gold market prompted buying in mining
stocks, with Sumitomo Metal Mining up Y10 to Y1,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 202.00 to 21,965.23 to 17.6m shares. The
index rose on small-lot buying by individuals.
Roundup
THE region, which frequently has a number of fairly static equity markets,
was divided between significant rises and falls although turnover, too, was
a moveable feast.
HONG KONG was boosted by the news of more talks on Hong Kong's controversial
new airport, and the Hang Seng index closed 134.02, or 1.9 per cent higher
at 7,148.10 in turnover up from HKDollars 4.58bn to HKDollars 5.05bn.
China-linked stocks prospered, World Trade topping the active list in
turnover of HKDollars 311.9m as it rose 30 cents to HKDollars 2.325.
Unisouth was up HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 15.
AUSTRALIA's gold stocks and key blue chips gained ground. The All Ordinaries
Index closed 14.7 higher at 1,715.1 in turnover of ADollars 255.4m as the
golds index soared 68 points to 1,854.8.
BHP also provided direction, moving up 18 cents to ADollars 14.10 after
announcing more than doubled earnings, and a positive outlook for the
current year last Friday.
NEW ZEALAND crept up to its highest close in almost three years, the NZSE-40
index ending 12.25 higher at 1,667.54 in low turnover of NZDollars 18m.
Telecom rose to a record high of NZDollars 3.15 as the stock realigned
itself to its price in the United States.
SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR closed higher on technical rebounds, the Straits
Times Industrial index rising 11.47 to 1,783.14 and the KLSE composite
finishing 13.27, of 11.9 per cent better at 722.07. MANILA offered much the
same story as the composite index closed 13.00 higher at 1,556.41.
TAIWAN saw a bearish final hour, the weighted index ending 98.83, or 2.4 per
cent lower at 4,044.46 in thin turnover. Trade in SEOUL was light, too, as
the composite stock index shed 15.05 to 734.22. BANGKOK slid in moderate
turnover as investors worried over the US attack on Iraq, the SET index
losing 12.02, or 1.3 per cent to 884.54.
KARACHI was propelled higher by blue chip buying as investors welcomed
Sunday's rapprochement talks between Pakistan's president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq
Khan, and its prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif. The KSE index rose 13.45 to
1,264.52.
BOMBAY weakened ahead of a news conference by the stockbroker at the centre
of India's Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal. Mr Harshad Mehta threatened to
make further revelations, and the BSE index closed 42.98 lower at 2,161.07.

bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was accused of window dressing as the DAX index rose another 11.96
to 1,707.20, a good 20 points over its March 31 level. Turnover rose from
DM6.0bn to DM6.1bn. Analysts, meanwhile, argued about the distribution of
share price rises and falls over the past three months.
The most obvious DAX strong points were the carmakers, BMW and Volkswagen.
BMW rose DM7.60 to DM517.80, up nearly 9 per cent over the past three
months; VW's DM10.70 gain to DM369.50 - based on a bullish magazine report,
strength in the yen and the dollar and a break above a key chart level -
left it with gains of 21 per cent since last March 31, and 52 per cent since
the end of last year.
'We have seen this before,' said Mr Bob Barber, the top automotive industry
analyst at James Capel in London, 'and it's all ended in tears.' Mr Barber
said that the car makers had seen an upswing like this in 1990 and 1992, but
that the fundamentals were now much worse than in those two years.
Elsewhere, other cyclical groups like chemicals and engineers were broadly
higher, while banks were relatively weak. Lufthansa continued its rally,
gaining DM5.40 or 4.7 per cent to DM120.80. While the firm dollar certainly
plays a role in the airline's climb, analysts said, the possibility of
improved Atlantic routes drove yesterday's trading.
MILAN remained nervous as the market awaited the outcome of talks between
the government and employers on a wage accord. However, after the close,
Confindustria, the main employers organisation, said that there had been no
progress, although a further round of negotiations could take place
tomorrow.
The Comit index closed up 5.91 or 1.1 per cent at 540.34.
Montedison, whose shares, along with those of its parent, Ferruzzi, were
suspended early on, provided further disappointing news at its annual
meeting yesterday when it announced that it had lifted its 1992 consolidated
net loss from a previously stated L1,244bn to L1,679bn.
Fiat gave some support to the market, although easing on the kerb to L6,410,
having fixed L152 higher at L6,451. However, telecommunications issues again
performed well, with Stet up L55 to L3,425 and Sip L62 higher at L2,541.
AMSTERDAM registered another good gain on the day, with a rise in the CBS
Tendency index of 1.2 to 112.7, as some cyclical stocks attracted investors.
Optimism that the Bundesbank could cut interest rates at its meeting on
Thursday also supported sentiment.
As Smith New Court notes in its latest European strategy document, the Dutch
market 'is benefiting from safe-haven status in Europe at a time when
earnings estimates in the other, more cyclical, markets are disappointing'.
The brokers believe that this market will remain attractive until monetary
policy is aggressively eased in France and Germany.
Philips moved to a new year's high, up 20 cents to Fl 29.40, while Royal
Dutch put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 176.60 and Heineken Fl 1.70 to Fl 182.80.
Among cyclicals Hoogovens improved Fl 1.60 to Fl 34.80, VNU by Fl 1.50 to Fl
116.40 and KNP BT by 80 cents to Fl 31.70.
PARIS rose on technical trading ahead of tomorrow's expiry of options and
futures contracts. The CAC-40 index gained 30.11 or 1.5 per cent to 1,990.95
in heavy turnover of FFr6.7bn.
A number of block trades helped to swell volume, with some 500,000 in Elf
going through as the shares gained FFr12 to FFr402. Alcatel also saw large
volume and the shares gained FFr6 to FFr661.
ZURICH was led higher by banks in good volume as the SMI index rose 21.8 to
2,369.70. Signs of easing interest rates in Switzerland and elsewhere in
Europe were one stimulus to the financials, and the increasing flow of cash
out of fixed interest markets was another.
In banks, CS Holding gained SFr40 to SFr2,680. However, the day's most
active stock was Nestle as it approached the end of rights trading, and the
underlying shares rose SFr19 to SFr1,146.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index hit an all-time high in early trade ahead of
late profit-taking, to close up 2.91 at 1,268.41.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by advances in a number of blue chip stocks, as the
Affarsvarlden general index put on 13.70 to 1,080.40. Ericcson B's gained
SKr9 to SKr335, a new year's high. after the group told investors in the US
that it expected a substantial increase in 1993 earnings.
HELSINKI added 2.7 per cent to the HEX index at 1,138.0, on gains in the
forestry sector, while COPENHAGEN's KFX index moved up 2.1 per cent to 91.08
on institutional buying.
VIENNA climbed by nearly 1 per cent on hopes of a cut in German interest
rates, the ATX index rising 7.34 to 860.53. Cyclical stocks were among the
leaders, with Veitscher gaining Sch14 to Sch258 and its parent company,
Radex, up Sch8 to Sch336.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index was driven higher by financials, 2.9 per cent
better on the day, as it closed 26.04 higher at 1,602.93, trading on the
prospect of further domestic rate cuts and a good outlook for the Irish
economy.
TEL AVIV closed sharply lower for its sixth consecutive losing session. The
Mishtanim blue chip index fell 5.21 or 2.7 per cent to 187.02 after a 2 per
cent fall on Sunday, reflecting heavy sales by both private investors and
mutual funds. However, a government decision not to impose a capital gains
tax on the stock exchange was expected to help share prices today.

FT  29 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Bourses climb as D-Mark weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attention in Europe last week was concentrated in the currency markets as
the D-Mark came under further pressure; but this factor enabled the French
authorities to make a further cut in their intervention and repo rates,
independently of the Bundesbank.
In spite of good runs from most of the continent's bourses, a run of
negative performances from markets on the Pacific Rim left the FT-Actuaries
world index just 0.45 per cent ahead in local currency terms.
The French move last Monday left domestic rates below those of Germany for
the first time in 26 years. But, says the UBS global equities team, for
French short rates to fall significantly lower 'would require the franc to
replace the D-Mark as the 'anchor' to the ERM', an event, they add, that is
very unlikely.
Hopes for a cut in German rates later this week also appear to be remote,
according to a number of brokers. According to Merrill Lynch's latest
European investment strategy, 'a stronger dollar reduces the likelihood of
German rate cuts, as the Bundesbank has repeatedly voiced its concern over
the inflationary impact of a stronger dollar'.
UBS notes that the problem facing the Bundesbank 'is that it has no hook
upon which to hang a rate cut. Money supply is above target, inflation is
still uncomfortably high and the currency is under pressure'.
Switzerland enjoyed a record breaking run last week, assisted by the dollar.
Mr Joe Rooney of Lehman Brothers comments that the Swiss market 'continues
to be one of the more attractively valued markets in Europe. . .and offers
an appealing alternative to the German market'.
Among Pacific Rim markets, Malaysia fell back sharply as investors continued
to take profits after recent gains; the market remains one of the best
performers in the FT-A World index, up 36 per cent year-on-year.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/DM rally falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR moved down sharply against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday after earlier failing to break through the DM1.72 level, writes
James Blitz.
At the start of London trading, the US currency was boosted by suggestions
that the Bundesbank might ease its official interest rates this week. Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's Deputy President, said that the DM1.70
level was an appropriate level for the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate and that
developments concerning the German budget deficit could provide more room
for lower interest rates.
These developments helped push the dollar up to a high of DM1.7180, but it
drifted back to a close of DM1.7000, down a net 0.20 pfennigs on the day.
Technical resistance at DM1.72 was one reason for the dollar's failure to
advance. Compounding this was a belief that Friday's non-farm payroll figure
for June may come out somewhat weaker than expected.
Last week's higher-than- expected weekly jobless claims figures and poor
durable goods figures have forced some economists to pare back their
expectations for the net payroll number to plus 25,000.
Mr Steve Hannah, a director at IBJ International in London, believes that US
economic weakness may continue to undermine the dollar. 'The dollar will
regain ground,' he said, 'but there is not enough substance in the price to
say that we have definitely pierced the DM1.70 level.'
The dollar's performance against the yen was even less robust as dealers
took the view that next week's G7 summit in Tokyo will see growing pressure
on the Japanese authorities to reduce their huge trade surplus.
Dealers believe that the US government has adopted a policy of dollar
depreciation in an attempt to reduce its trade deficit with Japan. The
current political crisis in Japan will ensure that Tokyo finds it
particularly hard to respond to US pressures with a concrete trade
agreement.
In London, the yen closed unchanged yesterday at Y106.05.
Sterling gained sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday
after a report from IDEA, the market analysts, suggested that the pound
would be one of the strongest currencies in the coming quarter.
The pound surged more than 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark at the start of
London trading, to peak at DM1.5470, before being sold off for the rest of
the day. But it still closed at DM2.5375, up 2 1/4 pfennigs on the day.
Sterling was much stronger against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4930
from a previous Dollars 1.4780.
On its trade weighted index, which measures the pound against a basket of
currencies, sterling closed some 0.8 percentage points higher at 80.3.
Dealers said there was very active buying of the UK currency in the early
London morning.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH franc interest rates continued to fall well below German levels
yesterday, as dealers took the view that France was getting increasingly
impatient with the pace of Bundesbank rate cuts, writes James Blitz.
Last week's fracas between Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and
Mr Edmond Alphandery, his French counterpart, was the dominant issue in
European money markets yesterday.
French politicians have recently called for co-ordinated European rate cuts
to help stimulate the continental economies. Mr Waigel said last week that
German rate cuts were a matter for the Bundesbank alone, and cancelled a
routine quarterly meeting of the France-German economic and finance council.
This tension raised suggestions that France might quit the exchange rate
mechanism in the autumn if German rates do not come down fast enough.
The most spectacular venue for such speculation yesterday was the French
franc futures market, where the September contract was up 20 basis points on
the day to close at 93.70. French cash rates were also sharply lower on the
day, down from 6.94 per cent to 6.82 per cent on the bid side.
These moves widened the spread between French and German prices on a day
when the German market was far less buoyant. The September Euromark contract
was up 5 basis points on the day at 93.16, broadening the spread against its
French counterpart to 54 basis points. Three month German cash was 5 basis
points higher on the bid side at 7.50 per cent.
There is some expectation that the Bundesbank will ease policy at this
week's council meeting. But Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets
in London, believes rate cutting could be deferred to the meeting on July
15, when the Bundesbank will have details of the government's budget deficit
reduction proposals for 1994.
Sterling futures markets continued to be very buoyant about the prospects
for another cut in UK base rates.
The September short sterling contract rose 4 basis points on the day to
close at 94.14. The December contract closed 5 basis points higher at 94.32.
Three month sterling cash rates were unchanged at 5 15/16 per cent, despite
difficulties removing a daily shortage of Pounds 1.2m.

FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Monopoly fears dog German coal
strategy - The difficult privatisation of the east's vast lignite fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUSITZER Braunkohle, or Laubag, is eastern Germany's biggest open-cast
lignite mine. These vast brown coal fields straddle the states of
Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. And like almost every other industry in
eastern Germany, Laubag is to be privatised.
The former state-run mines are currently under the Treuhand, the agency
charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry. But of
all the sales undertaken by the Treuhand, the privatisation of Laubag is
proving one of the most difficult.
A consortium, led by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE Energie,
western Germany's utility company, is negotiating to buy Laubag from the
Treuhand. The consortium includes RWE Energie, PreussenElektra, and
Bayernwerk, Germany's three biggest utility companies.
The big three, as they are known, already have interests in eastern Germany.
Each holds a 25 per cent stake in Vereinigte Energiewerke AG, or Veag,
eastern Germany's big utility company, which operates the region's high
voltage transmission grid and depends on brown coal for power generation.
Under the terms of the stromvertrag, or electricity contract of August 1990,
eastern Germany's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their energy
from Veag in order to underwrite the massive investments it is undertaking.
These include the modernisation, or construction, of brown coal-fired power
stations. In practise, however, the stromvertrag has severely restricted
competition in eastern Germany's electricity sector.
Although Veag is monopolised by the big three, it is legally owned by the
Treuhand, which intends to privatise it by the end of the year. But the
agency is insisting that the privatisation of Veag should be coupled with
the privatisation of the Laubag lignite fields.
'It makes sense,' a Treuhand official said. 'The sale of electricity and
coal must be linked. Both companies need each other. Veag needs Laubag's
coal for electricity generation and Laubag needs coal contracts with Veag
for its economic survival.'
It now appears, however, that Rheinbraun is slowing down the Treuhand's
attempts at selling Laubag partly to de-couple this complex privatisation
process. If Rheinbraun succeeded, Veag, once privatised, could be in a much
stronger position to negotiate coal contracts suited to its own interests.
Such a development would mean that the existing electricity monopoly in
eastern Germany would be extended to the brown coal sector - and dominated
by the same west German utility companies. The Treuhand is aware of this.
But as it has no choice, for the moment, but to negotiate only with the
Rheinbraun-led consortium for the sale of Laubag, the least the agency wants
is a competitive price structure introduced for eastern German lignite.
To make Laubag economically viable, the Treuhand reckons it requires annual
delivery contracts of about 57m tonnes to Veag's power generation blocks in
eastern Germany. But Rheinbraun is arguing that it is not certain it can
sell that amount to Veag because consumption of brown coal in eastern
Germany will not be high enough to absorb this amount.
Before unification annual lignite supply of 87.7m tonnes accounted for more
than 68 per cent of eastern Germany's primary energy consumption (compared
with 8.5 per cent in western Germany). In 1990, that figure fell by 12 per
cent, and a further 26 per cent in 1991 following the virtual collapse and
closure of eastern Germany's uncompetitive industry.
In a recent study, Goldman Sachs, the investment banker, suggests that
electricity demand in eastern Germany has bottomed out.
'The problem remains. It is difficult to give any precise forecasts for
future energy consumption of brown coal,' said Mr Gunther Kramer, one of the
board members of Laubag, and formerly employed by Rheinbraun.
'We are arguing with the Treuhand and Veag about the size of the coal
contracts, in particular about the price per tonne of coal,' a senior
Rheinbraun official said. 'We would prefer open coal contracts for Laubag,
rather than one which locks us into permanent contract deliveries, because
we are not sure about future consumption of brown coal,' he added.
Rheinbraun's reluctance to agree on coal delivery contracts for Laubag
coincides with a suggestion by Veag that it may delay part of its own
building programme, most notably, the construction of a second new 800 MW
power generation block at Boxberg, to which Laubag would deliver coal.
Mr Martin Martiny, a member of Veag's board, said recently that the building
timetable for Boxberg might be put back because 'it is difficult to know how
much brown coal eastern German industry will in future need, and therefore
how much Veag will require for power generation'.
Treuhand officials argue that if Veag does not adhere to its original
building programme, it will have the effect of delaying the privatisation of
Laubag.
'We cannot sell Laubag without an agreement with Veag over coal contract
deliveries,' a senior Treuhand official said. 'This is important for setting
the selling price, establishing the economic viability of Laubag,
guaranteeing jobs for the thousands who are employed at the mines and
financing environmental clean-up.'
But it is not primarily the uncertainty about eastern Germany's future
energy consumption of brown coal that is undermining the Treuhand's attempts
at putting coal contracts in place so as to speed up the privatisation of
Laubag, but rather the network of mutual west German interests attempting to
monopolise energy pricing in eastern Germany.
For instance, Veag is monopolised by the big three, which, through
Rheinbraun, is negotiating to buy Laubag. In theory, a comfortable
'in-house' private deal could be forged between Veag and Laubag on the size,
price and delivery timetable for coal contracts, once the Treuhand
privatises Veag. That is precisely what the Treuhand wants to avoid.
'You can see the challenge facing the Treuhand,' said an investment banker
who has advised the agency on other privatisation contracts. 'The Treuhand's
role is to privatise Laubag and Veag at the best possible price. Yet it
knows it has to deal with one big family which dominates Veag. That family
does not want to go against its own interests as it attempts to acquire
Laubag.'
Another investment banker agreed. 'Rheinbraun believes the Big Three in Veag
will drag its feet over setting the price and size of coal contracts for
Laubag because Veag believes electricity is more profitable than coal,' he
said. 'It thinks it can wear down the Treuhand in the hope that the agency
will de-couple Veag from the sale of Laubag, then the brown coal can be sold
at a much cheaper price to the big three consortium headed by Rheinbraun.'
The Treuhand appears determined to stick to its original plan. 'We are not
going to de-couple the privatisation of Veag and Laubag. There's little
enough competition in eastern Germany without extending a monopoly over coal
prices as well. The stromvertrag (electricity contract) has already limited
competition for electricity prices. We are not going to be pushed around,
and see the creation of another monopoly,' the senior Treuhand official
declared.
