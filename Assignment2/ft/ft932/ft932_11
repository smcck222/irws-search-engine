FT  14 JUN 93 / The pension bomb ticks unnoticed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If President Bill Clinton were truly a 'new democrat' he would launch a
national debate about the future of the federal government's largest
programme - social security (pensions and disabled). The point would not be
to tamper with the benefits of existing retirees but to ask whether the
promises made to current workers make sense or, indeed, can be honoured.
In just over a decade, the huge 'baby boom' generation (people born between
1945 and 1965) will start retiring. Over time, this will put enormous
pressure on the federal budget. On official estimates, the number of social
security beneficiaries per 100 insured workers will shoot up from 31 today
to about 50 in 2030 and, on pessimistic assumptions, to perhaps as many as
80 by 2070.
If US social security were an austere 'safety net' scheme, the demographic
pressures might be manageable. It is not. Broadly speaking, the US is in the
position of Britain in the early 1980s before the Thatcher government
savagely pruned the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In
contrast with the basic British pension, which rises in line with inflation,
retiring Americans receive a generous federal pension based on their average
lifetime earnings; once the pension payments begin they are indexed for
inflation. This year, retiring single-earner couples will get federal
pensions of up to Dollars 20,000.
So long as the ratio of pensioners to workers is stable, pension liabilities
rise at roughly the same pace as average earnings. But, if the ratio of
pensioners to workers shoots up, as it will when baby boomers retire, the
system is threatened with insolvency. Social security taxes are currently
about 12.6 per cent of payroll earnings. Federal actuaries reckon that
pension payments will rise from 11.6 per cent of earnings today to about 18
per cent late in the 21st century. On more pessimistic, yet plausible,
assumptions, the ratio could rise to 27 per cent.
If the far shakier trust fund covering medical benefits is included, the
figures look much worse: total benefit payments rise to 31 per cent of
payroll or a mind-boggling 52 per cent on pessimistic assumptions. In other
words, on unchanged policies present social security promises could require
anything from a 50 per cent increase to a near quadrupling of payroll taxes
on the working population.
When Mr Clinton is grappling with so many more immediate problems, including
healthcare reform, it may seem perverse to expect him to bother about
long-term demographic trends. After reforms in 1983, social security is
expected to generate surpluses for at least the next decade. But letting the
21st century take care of itself is highly irresponsible. The trouble with
pensions is that you have to give plenty of warning. It is no use waiting
until 2010 and then telling 65-year-old baby-boomers that the nation can no
longer honour its commitments. If future pensions are to be scaled back,
baby-boomers must be told today so as to have a chance of increasing their
private savings.
There are two main steps that could be taken to reduce future pension
liabilities. The link with earnings could be broken or greatly watered down.
Payroll taxes would then rise much faster than pension benefits,
compensating for the decline in the worker-pensioner ratio. The retirement
age could also be increased beyond 67 to, say, 72 to reflect past and
prospective improvements in life expectancy.
But, rather than simply watering down the present scheme, it would make
sense to consider radical alternatives. The threat of higher taxes on future
workers arises mainly from the difficulty within a public scheme of one
generation funding its own pensions. The Dollars 50bn social security
surplus generated last year was only notionally 'invested' in US government
securities. In reality it was spent just like any other government receipts.
When the social security fund's claims fall due in 20-30 years, the Treasury
can honour them only by raising taxes or increasing borrowing.
There will always be a strong case for a federal safety-net pension, to keep
the elderly out of poverty. But there is no economic reason why the federal
government should be raising huge sums in payroll taxes (more than Dollars
400bn last year) to be recycled as earnings-related pensions. If Mr Clinton
were bold, he would suggest instead that payroll taxes be sharply cut and
individuals be required to invest the cash released in portable private
pension schemes of their own choice. Baby-boomers' pensions would then
depend on the performance of their equity portfolios, which in turn would
depend on the economy's strength. Current workers would no longer face
steadily rising payroll taxes.
The political advantages of replacing social security (for future retirees)
with mandated contributions to private schemes would be legion. Mr Clinton
could claim to have cut taxes sharply, increased personal responsibility,
headed off the future insolvency of social security, given the financial
services industry a boost and, in all probability, sharply increased the
national savings rate. He would be the savviest new Democrat in town.
The depressing reality, of course, is that no American politician (Democrat
nor Republican) has the courage even to begin such a debate. Social security
is regarded as untouchable, whether or not the rules make sense.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Question mark over Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The writing is on the wall. It says: 'Too bad about Bosnia'.
All doubt has disappeared. The west has now conclusively advertised its
refusal to do anything effective about the tragic war in Bosnia. In a last,
minimalist gesture, the United Nations voted 10 days ago to authorise the
use of troops to defend Sarajevo and five other towns as 'safe havens' for
the Moslems. Last week, Nato foreign ministers duly endorsed the new UN
policy. Only one thing was missing - any willingness to provide the minimum
number of 5,000 extra troops needed to carry it out.
In preference, Nato governments agreed on a three-point strategy which
signalled clearly that they have virtually written off this bloody conflict.
First, Nato aircraft will patrol the skies. In theory, this is to protect UN
troops in the safe havens but, in reality, air strikes cannot substitute for
inadequate troops because they are as likely to kill civilians as Serb
soldiers. Second, the US will make the cost-free gesture of sending a little
company of 300 soldiers to Macedonia, where there is no fighting, as a
symbolic deterrent to any wider ambitions by the Serbs. And third, Nato will
hold a special summit meeting towards the end of the year to try to work out
how to do better in future.
In plain English, Nato's three-point strategy can be summed up in three
words: gesticulation, containment, obfuscation.
Each of these elements is understandable in its own terms. The trouble is
that, cumulatively, they are deeply damaging for the west - never mind the
terrible sufferings of the people of Bosnia. They are damaging to the
political and moral authority of the west, damaging to relations between
Europe and the US, and damaging to the credibility of Nato. This damage will
not be put right by yet another summit.
The ostensible purpose of the meeting is to plan for Nato's future. The real
purpose is to try to patch up the transatlantic rift exposed by the war in
Bosnia. The Clinton administration will hope to impress the Europeans with
the president's leadership and commitment to the alliance. But the war in
Bosnia has demonstrated a profound divide in strategic interests between
Europe and the US, and it will not be erased by any summit communique. From
the US point of view, there may be very good reasons for not wanting to get
involved in a small civil war on the southern fringe of Europe. But the US's
critical mass is such that its refusal has hobbled the rest of the alliance.
Of course, it is unreasonable to lay all the blame on the US. From the
beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, European governments repeatedly advertised
their reluctance to use military force, thus renouncing the option of
intimidating the warring parties. But US reluctance further undermined the
military option for Europe.
As it is, France and Britain are by far the biggest contributors of troops
to the UN humanitarian protection force in Bosnia. But a shift from
humanitarian protection to the active use of military force would require a
large increase in troop strengths, which could come only through the
mobilisation of resources across the breadth of the alliance. Thus, the US
refusal virtually amounted to a veto.
After this, there must now be a serious question mark over Nato's future.
Nato has lost its original unifying raison d'etre with the disintegration of
the massive military threat from the Soviet Union, though it is possible
that the political turmoil in Russia may again confront the west with a
serious military threat. Meanwhile, all alliance governments, including the
French, want to keep Nato going; at the Rome Summit of 1991, they drafted a
new strategy for peace, based on dialogue and co-operation between east and
west.
Unfortunately, they skirted round the central probability - that the most
immediate threats to the stability and security of Europe would be likely to
come from smaller and less predictable regional conflicts. The war in Bosnia
is only one of several conflicts detonated by the break-up of the Soviet
bloc. Others include the war in Georgia and that between Armenia and
Azerbaijan. The new Nato strategy recommends 'crisis management' and
'conflict prevention'; but it does not say how these admirable functions
would be carried out by an essentially military alliance like Nato. That
uncertainty has been made more acute by the war in Bosnia, because it has
revealed profound differences in strategic appreciation between Europe and
America.
The Bosnian war, and the west's inability to stop it by force, provide the
motivation behind the French proposal for a 'pact for security and stability
in Europe', put forward by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister.
The French objective is to prevent a repetition of the Yugoslav tragedy, by
some sort of collective management of potential conflicts over frontiers and
ethnic minorities. Exactly how these conflicts are to be defused is far from
clear. But the French seem to envisage some sort of diplomatic-security
negotiation conducted by the European Community.
The first problem is that ethnic conflicts are liable to beingdriven by
blind emotion. As in Bosnia, they may not be susceptible to rational
negotiation by outsiders. The second problem is that the French scheme will
need to be very ambitious if it is to measure up to the two most serious
crises in the former Soviet Union: Russia's claim to a right to intervene in
neighbouring states; and the potential for conflict in the tension between
Russia and Ukraine over Ukrainian territory, Ukrainian nuclear weapons, and
even Ukrainian independence.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Apostle of low inflation - Donald Brash,
governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, speaks to Kevin Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, is rare among
central bankers: he has also been an active politician. He might have been
appointed finance minister in the present conservative government had he not
been deprived of a safe parliamentary seat by a by-election protest vote 12
years ago.
Yet it is hard to see how he could have had more impact on New Zealand from
the Beehive, the government building, than he now has from the governor's
office across the road.
In four and a half years as governor, he has presided over a fall in the
rate of inflation from 9 per cent to 1 per cent. More important, the
consensus among economists is that price stability can be maintained,
extraneous shocks aside.
Government ministers, from the present prime minister down, praise Mr
Brash's skills highly in private, and even Mr Mike Moore, the Labour
opposition leader, says he has great admiration for Mr Brash's handling of
monetary policy.
Interviewed in his spartan office, Mr Brash is keen to talk about New
Zealand's victory over inflation, but modest about his own role.
Softly spoken and reticent, he is flattered by overseas interest, if a
little surprised at the form some of the praise has taken. With a laugh, he
refuses to comment on the suggestion by Samuel Brittan of the FT that he
should have been appointed governor of the Bank of England.
Mr Brash does not claim sole credit for transforming New Zealand's inflation
prospects. Radical labour market deregulation and fiscal prudence by the
conservative National party government have helped to reduce inflationary
pressures.
He is also becoming something of an apostle for New Zealand's innovative
Reserve Bank Act, passed with cross-party support by the former Labour
government in 1990, which put ultimate responsibility for fighting inflation
in the governor's lap.
Mr Brash will be evangelising on the benefits of central bank independence
in London this Thursday in a speech to the European Policy Forum, the
free-market think-tank.
He will resist the temptation to present the New Zealand model as a complete
solution to the UK's inflation problems. But his elucidation of the act's
'elegant constitutional structure' will add weight to those, such as the
combative Mrs Ruth Richardson, New Zealand's finance minister, who believe
it would transplant relatively easily to the UK.
The act marked a watershed for New Zealand, which had suffered double-digit
inflation for most of the 20 years since 1970, with the exception of an
artificial fall during a prices freeze in 1983-84.
Supporters claim the act achieves a compromise between the relative
subservience of Threadneedle Street to the UK government and the
independence of the US Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank.
As with the Bundesbank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has total
independence in the operation of monetary and exchange rate policy, subject
to the provision that its sole objective is to achieve and maintain price
stability.
But the act leaves the definition of price stability to the government,
which sets a target range for inflation in the form of a personal contract
with the governor, usually for a fixed five-year term.
The government can amend the contract, by fiat or by negotiation, but any
change must be made formally and publicly, ensuring that monetary policy is
always transparent. The government can also fire the governor if he fails to
achieve the target but, contrary to popular belief, his salary is not
directly linked to inflation performance.
The act has made Mr Brash a symbol of New Zealand's commitment to low
inflation, and no one was surprised when Mrs Richardson announced nine
months early that he would be reappointed for five years from this
September. His contract will require inflation to be maintained at 0-2 per
cent - effectively a continuation of the existing contract, which required
him to reduce inflation to 0-2 per cent between 1990 and September 1993.
The government's role in choosing the governor means the bank is only as
independent as its leader. It would be possible, concedes Mr Brash, for a
government to relax its anti-inflationary stance, for example, by appointing
a compliant governor or by pressing an incumbent hoping for reappointment to
accept a renegotiation of the target.
But he argues that the openness of the system, combined with the disciplines
imposed by the financial markets, make it unlikely that any government would
take the risk. 'It is obviously important to have someone in the post who
strongly believes in price stability, but the framework does make it more
difficult to derive the essentially short-term benefits of pushing inflation
up.
'The incentives for a government to do that are not great because they have
to make their intentions clear. An instantaneous bond market reaction would
follow any loosening of the target by an injudicious amendment of the
contract; governments know that.'
But these are hypothetical problems. In practice, the most frequent
complaint against Mr Brash is that he has pursued low inflation with
excessive zeal, at high social cost. Mr Ken Douglas, president of the
Council of Trade Unions and a critic of the act, claims the central bank put
the economy into shock by disinflating too rapidly, causing a loss of
confidence and high unemployment: 'We have been an international experiment
for the mad scientists from the International Monetary Fund. No other
economy has been as savagely restructured as ours.'
Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Brash hints that the initial target may indeed have
been too rigorous. It was 'very narrow', and he admits it left little leeway
for forecasting errors.
He also concedes that the bank made mistakes in manipulating the 'crude
steering device' of monetary policy, particularly during the trough of the
New Zealand recession in 1991, when inflation fell faster than expected.
But he rejects the suggestion that the bank contributed to the depth or
length of the recession, arguing that the long-term benefits of rapid
disinflation greatly outweigh the short-term pain.
'New Zealand has incurred all sorts of costs through being late into the
disinflation game, but one of the advantages was that we were able to learn
lessons from what had been done elsewhere,' he says.
'For example, in many of the countries where disinflation has been achieved,
wage settlements have not been moderated, so that when the foot came off the
monetary brake inflation took off again.
The bank's most significant achievement, he says, has been a change in
inflationary expectations. 'One of the most important things that has
happened is that, regardless of whether people agree with the policy, they
know that miserable bloke in the Reserve Bank is going to keep pursuing it.'
Selling this message is becoming easier as New Zealand consolidates what
appears to be a sustainable economic recovery. Growth in GDP reached 3 per
cent in the 12 months to December, and is widely forecast to be 2.5 to 3 per
cent for the next two years.
But Mr Brash chooses his words carefully when asked if the New Zealand model
could deliver similar results in other countries. Mrs Richardson asserts
that the act is part of New Zealand's 'exportable economic policy
technology'. Mr Brash, however, says the act 'nicely balances the
understandable desire on the part of an elected government to have an
involvement in the target-setting process with the universally agreed fact
that independent central banks are able to deliver low inflation rates at
lower costs than central banks which are subject to very close political
direction.
'It is a very useful bulwark against any government which might wish to
return to the bad old days of saying one thing to the public (about the need
to control inflation) and at the same time trying to get mortgage rates down
before an election. That is the sort of thing which used to happen in New
Zealand, and cannot happen now.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Test for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers will focus this week on data which will test
whether the US is experiencing inflation at the current stage of the
recovery, writes James Blitz.
In recent weeks there has been a growing belief that inflation is set to
rise in the US, a phenomenon which would force the Federal Reserve to raise
short term interest rates.
Last Friday, the May producer prices figure US showed that the rate of
inflation was far smaller than had been anticipated, with the ex-food and
energy figure up 0.2 per cent on the month.
But the market will wait for the consumer price inflation figure for May,
due out tomorrow, before giving its final verdict on US interest rate moves.
The Michigan consumer confidence survey for June, which is due on Friday,
will also show whether the PPI figure was a blip.
After the onslaught that it has received in recent days, the near term
outlook for the dollar against the yen will be affected by two sets of data
this week.
Thursday brings the April trade balance for the US which is set to show
another deficit. DKB International predicts that this will be in the order
of Dollars 8.5bn, following a deficit of Dollars 10.2bn for March.
Even more important will be the Japanese trade balance for May. The yen rose
strongly on the back of the April figure of Dollars 10.2bn, because the US
is so keen to see Tokyo's trade surplus reduced. A strong surplus this time
might have a similar effect, pushing the yen towards the Y100 level against
the dollar.
In Germany, the week's key data will be the M3 money supply figure for May,
which is expected to show a slight dip. But, the Bundesbank is unlikely to
ease monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Futures fund managers reassess the cash
implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN investors consider which futures funds to buy, they are faced with an
almost infinite array of trading systems and analytical techniques for
investing in the futures markets. But the structure of futures funds means
that often only a relatively small portion of the fund is actually invested
in margins on futures contracts or option premiums: the remainder is
invested in the money markets.
The performance of this part of the fund has often tended to be ignored.
However increasing competition in the futures fund business has encouraged
greater care to be taken in the management of the cash portion of the fund.
In particular, the decline of short-term interest rates has forced fund
managers to reassess their approach.
Some smaller futures fund managers, particularly in the US, are starting to
farm out the management of the cash portion of their funds.
'People concentrate on the things that they are interested in,' says Ms
Diane Mix, of Horizon Cash Management, which is now trying to market its
services to European futures funds. '(Futures fund managers) are very keen
on the futures side and tend not to concentrate on the rest of the money,
which consequently doesn't earn as much as it should.'
In the US, many fund managers have simply invested the cash portion of funds
in Treasury bills or in an interest-bearing account, according to Ms Mix.
In fact, once a large pool of cash is available, better returns can be
earned from commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit.
According to one large futures fund management group, which manages its own
funds' cash, it is difficult for funds with less than Pounds 5m in cash to
get attractive rates. In the CP and CD markets, bid/offer spreads are
uncompetitive in small sizes. Term deposits can also be unattractive,
because of the penalties imposed for early redemption, which means that
potentially better margins can easily be lost.
Ms Mix says her company is looking to offer returns equal to or better than
prevailing T-bill rates. Historically, she says, futures fund managers have
achieved less than bill rates, partly because of the relatively high fees
subtracted from returns.
                     *      *      *
WHILE derivatives may still be giving regulators some sleepless nights,
credit rating agencies seem to be rather less perturbed.
Moody's, one of the leading US credit rating agencies, has completed a
report on the credit risk implications of derivatives activities which
concludes that few of the financial institutions it rates have been
materially affected by their derivatives activities.
'There will be losses at individual entities from bad risk analysis, bad
controls, or plain bad luck, but derivatives are not a ticking time-bomb for
banks and securities houses,' according to Mr Douglas Lucas, assistant
vice-president of Moody's financial institutions group.
Moody's found that the risk-adjusted returns to derivative dealers have
generally been high, and that losses, so far, have not resulted in
significant credit implications.
Mr Lucas believes it is the 'large numbers, cryptic nature and opaque
disclosure' of the derivative markets which have fuelled fears about the
risks involved.
He noted that Moody's has never changed an institution's rating solely on
the basis of derivative operations.
'Typically, the factors arguing in favour of an adjustment in our ratings
cut across an institution's balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities,'
he said.
Moody's divides its overview of derivatives risk at a financial institution
into four main areas - the purposes of the activity, market risk, credit
risk and operating risk.
Mr Lucas takes the view that derivatives are usually used by financial
institutions to assume risks similar to those already taken in other ways.
But it is an issue the agency explores with both financial institutions and
industrial companies: 'It does have the potential to be a negative in the
credit picture,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Activity in fledgling Asian Dragons
begins to take off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA'S Dragon bond market is still in its infancy, with the handful of
issues launched so far adding up to just over Dollars 2bn.
But with the recent flurry of activity - five borrowers have launched issues
in Asia in the last three months and more are rumoured to be lining up deals
 -some bankers are wondering whether the fledgling market has finally taken
off.
A Dragon bond is similar in structure to a Eurobond, except it is listed in
Asia (usually in Hong Kong or Singapore) and is targeted at investors in the
region. It is usually heavily marketed in Asia and traded in the Asian time
zone so that investors there get first bite at the cherry before London
wakes up for trading.
Mr Andrew Pisker, managing director of corporate finance at Lehman Brothers
International, notes that one of the main aims of the borrower is to attract
a wider range of investors in Asia.
'There is a large market out there . . . there are investors in the region
who have bought Eurobonds, and if you are an issuer you should have a large
investor base,' he says.
The seven Dragon bonds issued to date range from the Asian Development
Bank's dollar and yen deals (which provided the foundation for the market)
to financial agencies (such as Nordic Investment Bank, European Investment
Bank and Swedish Export Credit), as well as General Electric Capital
Corporation (GECC), the sole corporate name to have tapped this market.
Lehman Brothers says the issues have attracted a wide range of investors in
the region, including central banks, regional and local commercial banks,
non-bank financial institutions, fund managers and mutual funds.
Mr Peter Yngwe, treasurer and head of finance department at Swedish Export
Credit (known in the market as SEK) says one reason for launching a Dollars
200m Dragon bond issue earlier this month was 'to tap into a market where we
find old and new investors, so we are broadening our investor base. It
should be easier to be remembered if we are there early.'
But just as important, he claims, is the implied commitment to the Asian
region. 'It suits us because we are lending to Swedish exporters and we have
a lot of corporations in Sweden which do business in Asia, for example in
infrastructure projects.'
According to Lehman Brothers, lead manager for GECC's Dollars 300m five-year
Dragon bond in March, GECC was keen to raise funds from Asian investors to
demonstrate its 'commitment to the (Asian) region', especially since it is
involved in joint ventures in the area.
The Asian Development Bank is keen to develop the capital markets in the
region, and some capital market participants hope to see more and more big
names turning to the Dragon bond market.
Mr Yngwe of SEK sees a gradual development of the Asian market, with the
current triple-A rated names blazing the trail.
He predicts local banks will turn to the Dragon bond market because of the
strong need for financing in the region related to infrastructure and
construction projects.
One senior investment banker in Hong Kong thinks the Dragon bond market will
remain an arena for triple-A and double-A credits in the immediate future,
but he predicts that 'in five years' time we'll probably have seen a move
down the credit rating spectrum'.
Not all international bond market participants are so enthusiastic about the
future of the Dragon bond market. Some question the point of launching
issues aimed only at Asia. These detractors would prefer to see 'big name'
borrowers launching global bond issues, or else considering bond issues
launched in both Asia and Europe.
'There's no practical reason why we shouldn't have a sort of hybrid bond
issue launched in Asia and Europe,' says one syndicate head at a Japanese
house.
But the more serious criticisms levelled at the recent Dragon bond issues
concern their relatively poor liquidity and the fact that in some cases,
yield spreads have widened out in the period since launch.
The deals issued by the Nordic Investment Bank, European Investment Bank and
SEK were all seen as aggressively priced at the time of launch. Dealers
point out that Eurobond spreads over US treasury bonds have tightened very
slightly in recent weeks, whereas the yield spreads on NIB, EIB and SEK
Dragon bonds have inched very slightly wider.
Naturally, borrowers are keen to raise funds at the most aggressive pricing
possible, and can usually borrow at a similar cost using a Dragon bond or a
Eurobond.
But as one Hong Kong-based banker put it: 'Perhaps the lesson to be learned
is not to price the next few deals too tightly or investors may be deterred
from buying the bonds if they see that there is a risk of spreads widening
out again. Otherwise there's a danger the market will crash and burn.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / Spanish Bonds: Socialist victory keeps dealers bullish for
now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE month ahead of the Pamplona bull-running fiesta that Ernest Hemingway
put on the map, the Spanish government bond market bulls are already out in
force.
Government bonds have leapt forward on the news of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's
re-election. As the market sees it, he stands for a strong commitment to the
ERM. And although he was short of a majority, the parliamentary shortfall
means that Catalan nationalists, with all their alleged fiscal probity, will
shore up the new government.
The rally finally flattened the yield curve and brought the long bond down
by more than 20 points to below 10.80, with just a 65-basis point margin
over the three-year bond. Earlier this year the differential had been at
least one percentage point.
It looked like good news all the way. Pragmatic politicians were in place,
the currency risk was fading, and interest rates would fall at a reasonable
pace. The pre-election alternative had been the inexperienced right-wing
opposition party gaining power, cutting rates and possibly suspending ERM
membership.
The market felt there was now room for Spanish rates to ease in the wake of
German cuts. Bank of Spain governor Mr Luis Angel Rojo fuelled the feel-food
factor by saying the peseta was back on the track of being linked into
Germany.
It is likely investors will be reassured about currency stability over the
summer as Spain's tourism industry, powered by three devaluations since
September, begins to make a significant impact on the current account
deficit.
But that is possibly as far as the good news goes. More cautious analysts
believe the rally could hit a wall well before September. There are already
signs of nervousness over the apparent inability of President Gonzalez to
secure quickly his victory of a week ago.
The market does not like squabbles in Mr Gonzalez's socialist party over
whether the Catalans should be invited into the government or not. Nor does
it like similar quarrels among the Catalans about whether any invitations
should be accepted.
Should the political imponderables resolve themselves, the crunch is likely
to come after September, when the markets start looking at inflation,
unemployment, and the budget deficit.
The May inflation figure published today is expected to show a year-on-year
figure unchanged at 4.6 per cent and underlying inflation unchanged at 5.8.
In June, when the latest devaluation works through to prices, inflation
could start to climb and most bets are on a year-end figure of almost 5 per
cent.
Unemployment could look increasingly grim as the economy enters the fourth
quarter. Last month registered unemployed fell by less than 1 per cent, the
lowest May fall for 10 years, to stand at 16.3 per cent of the working
population.
The budget deficit - 4.4 per cent of GDP according to the government and
nearer 6 per cent according to the conservative opposition - could be
another headache.
If Mr Gonzalez was unable to reduce deficits effectively in the past, when
he had a strong majority and the economy was growing, how, economists might
ask, will he rein in spending in the middle of a recession and at the head
of a coalition government.
It could well be that the rate cuts, should they occur, will not look so
impressive in three months. Even if there are significant German cuts,
Spanish rates are unlikely to fall below 9 per cent, and real interest rates
will remain at around 4 per cent.
That scenario suggests there could be renewed speculative attacks on the
peseta in September. The difference this time will be that the peseta might
not be able to avoid following the route of the pound and the lira.

FT  14 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Wall Street relaxes inflation watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGING by the recently released May producer prices index, it looks as if
the inflation scare may be over. At least it should be by tomorrow, when the
second half of the monthly inflation data - the consumer prices index - is
released.
If the CPI numbers are as reassuring as the PPI numbers were (wholesale
prices were unchanged in May, and the core rate, which excludes the volatile
food and energy components, was up only 0.2 per cent), then the bond market
faces relatively plain sailing over the next few weeks.
After a month of navigating choppy waters whipped up by fears that rising
inflation would lead to higher interest rates (it was a month in which the
yield on the 30-year bond rose from just under 6.8 per cent to over 7 per
cent), fixed-income investors must be looking forward to a little
tranquility.
First, however, they will have to get past the final hurdle of tomorrow's
consumer prices report. Analysts are forecasting that both the headline and
core CPI numbers will show an advance of 0.2 per cent for May. This would be
a significant improvement from the average 0.4 per cent growth registered
over the first four months of the year.
If the CPI numbers come in substantially above forecast, then the Federal
Reserve could choose to tighten monetary policy, the weak May PPI numbers
notwithstanding. Such a tightening would probably take the form of a
25-basis point rise in the federal funds rate, to 3.25 per cent, rather than
a fully-fledged increase in the discount rate, which has been at 3 per cent
all year.
Overall, however, Wall Street has relaxed its inflation watch. Most analysts
estimate that inflation will top out at the 3 to 3.5 per cent range for
1993. There is growing belief that the 4 per cent-plus inflation rates seen
earlier this year were a short-term hangover from the unexpectedly strong
economic growth registered at the end of 1992. It was growth that encouraged
some producers and retailers to raise their prices. The subsequent slowdown
since then should see prices come back from the early-year highs.
Amid all the fuss over inflation, the Clinton administration and the Fed
have continued to dance a delicate two-step.
Last week President Clinton met with Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan and
reiterated the administration's strongly-held view that the economy was not
strong enough to withstand an interest rate rise. The chorus of politicians
warning the Fed not to put up rates got even louder after the favourable PPI
numbers were released.
At the same time, Fed governors, led by Mr Lawrence Lindsay, were warning
that the Fed was prepared to raise interest rates if inflation looked as if
it might get out of hand. Mr Greenspan himself, however, said in a letter to
a senior Congressman last week that he was disappointed by the poor rate of
economic growth in the first quarter, and that promoting sustainable
economic expansion remained a 'crucial objective' of monetary policy.
Although the bond market was not quite sure what to make of all this, its
attention this week should switch quickly to more overtly political matters
 -such as the progress, or otherwise, of the President's deficit-reduction
package, currently making its way through Congress.
In the past week, the chances of the package being passed by the Senate have
improved, although at the cost of the energy tax, which analysts say will
probably be dumped by the administration in favour of a combination of some
kind of transportation or petrol tax and fresh cuts in spending.
The market has so far taken the horse-trading over the economic package in
its stride. As Ms Kathleen Stephansen of securities house Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette says: 'At this stage of the dialogue the composition of
deficit-cutting measures is less important than achieving the cuts.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Bank's offering fails to discourage demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement on Friday by the Bank of England that Pounds 700m of bonds
will be on sale from today failed to puncture generally good demand for
gilts from overseas investors.
While the short end of the yield curve suffered a little as an imminent cut
in base rates appeared to diminish, continental European and US institutions
were seen as moderate buyers of gilts as sterling suffered little fall-out
from fresh signs of UK political instability.
There was some support for gilt purchases from indications that Conservative
ministers were preparing for tough action to hold back public spending. Such
moves could in time curb the rising public sector borrowing requirement and
push up gilt prices.
During the week, yields fell along the curve, by around 10 basis points at
the 20-year area and by somewhat less for securities maturing in the next
five years.
The Bank said it would sell Pounds 700m of the 8.75 per cent Treasury stock
due 2017. This is part of the massive effort by the UK authorities to fund
the PSBR, expected to be Pounds 50bn this financial year. Taking into
account some over-funding last year, and other factors, this is expected to
necessitate gilt sales of around Pounds 40bn.
While such a large stock of bonds will almost certainly depress prices along
the gilt curve, there is some support for the notion that inflationary
pressures are not too much of a problem for the foreseeable future.
This is reflected in the market expectations about the the latest figures
for the retail prices index due this Thursday. In the year to last month,
according to the City consensus, the increase in the RPI will turn out to be
just 1.4 per cent, as opposed to the 1.3 per cent year on year rise recorded
in April.
Expectations are that the year on year increase in the RPI, excluding
mortgage costs, will turn out to be 2.9 per cent, the same as in the year to
May.
Last week, Mr Eddie George, who will soon be governor of the Bank of
England, went out of his way to cast doubt on ideas that inflation in the UK
was beaten. He said this certainly was not the view of the gilt market, with
10-year yields at around 8 per cent as opposed to base rates of 6 per cent.
With a strong warning against any new reductions in short-term borrowing
costs, Mr George's speech pushed up yields a little at the short end of the
gilt curve. This was on the basis that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new
chancellor, would be likely to take heed of the governor designate in any
new ruminations about interest rate changes.
However, Mr George's strictures about inflation settled investors in
longer-term securities. Many of them reckon the new governor will be in a
better position to use his influence over interest-rate decisions than was
Lord Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor whose term of office ends in two
weeks.
The repercussions in the gilt market from the broadside at government policy
by Mr Norman Lamont, the ex-chancellor, in the Commons last week were
extremely limited. As one market observer put it, the general atmosphere of
fragility surrounding the government is already reflected in stock prices
and Mr Lamont's comments did little to alter the situation.
There was general lack of interest in the deposed chancellor's comments that
for over two years he had tried to persuade Mr John Major of the necessity
of making the Bank of England independent in monetary policy.
This was seen as largely an academic affair, even though it was one small
step along the road towards taking interest rate decisions out of the hands
of politicians. One person closely acquainted with the Bank's operations
said: 'There's not a snowball's chance in hell of the Bank being made
independent in the next two to three years.'
Gilts were given something of a boost by the investor selling last week of
the D-Mark which helped other currencies, particularly sterling. Also, the
leaking of government plans to look closely at ways of constraining rises in
social security spending, which accounts for about a third of all government
spending, helped to put a floor under gilt prices.

MICROSOFT, the US computer software group, is in talks with Time Warner, the
entertainment group, and Tele-Communications Inc, the big cable television
company, to set up a joint venture to develop interactive software for
television, according to news reports.
Although the three companies have not commented on the reports, their
negotiations are expected to lead to the establishment of a new company
producing software for cable television boxes.
The software would provide cable subscribers with access to a wide array of
interactive information and services. It would allow them to shop by
television, view individually-selected news and statistics, or select films
and video games from a vast electronic library.
The link-up between Microsoft, Time Warner and TCI would represent the
latest in a series of moves by large computer, entertainment and
communications companies joining forces to develop interactive media
technology for cable television users.
In April, Microsoft announced it was getting together with the micro-chip
manufacturer Intel and cable hardware company General Instrument to develop
a cable TV box with a built-in interactive personal computer.

IN reference to a report in the Financial Times on June 1, Japan's seven
trust banks say they did not change their accounting procedures, and counted
as revenue only cash received on their trust accounts, and did not utilise
accrued basis accounting methods.
The banks attribute their improved operating profits for the year ending in
March to favourable margins on interest rates, which fell during the period,
and to cost cutting.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enron thrives in an open market
/ Charting the rise of 'the US's biggest natural gas group'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deregulation of the tightly controlled natural gas business in the US has
opened up opportunities for energy companies, none more so than for Enron,
based in the US oil and gas capital, Houston.
Non-existent 10 years ago, Enron has mushroomed to the point where it claims
 -with some justification - to be 'the nation's largest natural gas
company'. Its status is embodied in the shiny skyscraper it occupies in the
city centre next to other giants of the energy business.
Enron was born in 1985 from the merger of a natural gas and a pipeline
company. It owes its rapid growth largely to decisions taken by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to lift decades-old controls which
restricted the operations of gas companies and put a lid on prices. In
particular, the 'unbundling' of gas transportation and sales services gave
greater freedom to companies to compete.
But two other factors also played a role. One was the changing perception of
gas from a by-product best flared off at the wellhead to an efficient,
environmentally friendly fuel ideal for power generation. Another was the
view of Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, of the gas market as one of
boundless opportunity.
Today, Enron is in all important stages of the gas business. It has an
exploration and production arm through its 80 per cent interest in Enron Oil
and Gas; it owns a 40,000-mile network of gas pipelines extending up towards
the Great Lakes and outwards to Florida and California; it provides gas
supply and distribution services, and downstream it builds and operates
power stations.
The area of the market where Enron has been specially successful is in
exploiting the new freedom to market gas. Its gas services division has
built up a speciality in designing tailor-made long-term supply contracts
for customers using sophisticated hedging and financing techniques. It also
trades heavily in the gas market: 10 per cent of all the gas bought and sold
in the US passes through Enron's hands. This gives it a liquidity few
competitors can match.
Although the biggest part of Enron's growth has come in the US, it has also
exported its vision of a gas conglomerate. In April, the company opened a
1,875MW power station on the UK's Teesside. Enron owns 50 per cent of the
Dollars 1.2bn facility, which it expects to be the pre-cursor to others in
the UK. It is also negotiating projects in India, Germany, Turkey and
Kuwait, and it has bought a stake in a pipeline network in Argentina.
The strong expansion in electricity demand predicted for the Third World
over the next decade is all factored into Enron's growth plans.
The wave carrying Enron forward has been reflected in its results. Earnings
have risen at a compound annual rate of nearly 30 per cent since 1988,
reaching Dollars 306m last year. And Mr Lay is confidently predicting growth
of another 20 per cent this year. 'All our businesses are doing a bit
better,' he says.
Mr Lay bases this optimism on the strength of the US gas market. After years
of glut, he reckons that supply and demand have finally come into balance,
and this is reflected in the rise in gas prices to as much as 60 per cent
over last year's levels. According to US government statistics, US gas
demand rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, but production
went up less than 1 per cent.
However, further out, Enron expects US natural gas growth to be strong well
into the next century. Its latest forecast puts demand at 22,000bn cu ft in
the year 2000 (it was 18,000bn last year), rising to more than 25,000bn in
2010. Enron's estimates of US gas reserves are also rosy: they suggest there
is enough to last 71 years.
Much of the rest of the US energy business seems to share Mr Lay's
enthusiasm for gas. Other large companies such as Mobil, Shell and Exxon see
a good part of their future growth coming there as well.
Not everyone, however, is as optimistic about the level of reserves. Mr
Robert Hermes, president of Purvin &amp; Gertz, a Houston firm which specialises
in oil and gas research, says: 'The attitude is that we've got all we want.
People are over-optimistic. We have been living off a surplus, but that day
is over.'
He points out that the strength of the gas price has not sparked a surge in
exploration activity because people are worried about the volatility of the
market.
Another potential cloud on Enron's horizon is the energy tax being proposed
by President Bill Clinton. Although it is still not clear what form it will
take, Mr Lay says he is confident it will be a tax on energy consumers
rather than energy companies. That, he says, is 'a tax we can live with'.
But can Enron keep up the pace now that the initial flush of deregulation is
over and strong competitors are moving into the market?
Mr David Fleischer, gas industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes it can.
He is predicting long-term earnings growth for Enron of 15 per cent. 'It's
an even better managed company than most people think it is,' he says. 'Mr
Lay has turned it round during a period which buried many other companies.'
Mr Lay's response to concerns about Enron running out of steam is that it is
wrong to view the last five years as ones of exceptional growth for the
natural gas business. For much of that period there was still regulation and
uncertainty, and Enron's success came in spite of rather than thanks to
events. 'The market growth will be bigger in the next five years than in the
last,' he forecasts.

business

<TEXT>
VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, expects to announce the disposal
of its ferry business this week, according to a senior executive in the
company.
Trading in Vard's shares were suspended temporarily on Friday in Oslo and
London. On Thursday Vard's shares closed on the Oslo bourse up NKr3 at
NKr25, and were the second most actively traded with 3 per cent of the share
capital worth NKr23.8m (Dollars 3.44m) changing hands.
Mr Trygve Hegnar, a Vard board member, on March 15 made an 'indicative'
offer of NKr1.2bn for the ferry business, which includes the Scandi and
Larvik lines.
Union Bank of Switzerland is leading negotiations on behalf of Mr Hegnar and
a group of financial investors, while Mr Truls Sanner, Vard's chief
executive, is negotiating on behalf of the board. Mr Hegnar is also Vard's
second biggest shareholder with an 11.8 per cent stake in the group.
In Vard's 1992 accounts, the three ferries which make up the fleet were
booked at a value of NKr455m.
Vard forecast a 'satisfactory' result in 1993 for the ferry business. Last
year, the business achieved its best result ever, posting a net profit of
NKr123.7m against NKr104.5m in the previous year. In the first quarter of
this year, however, it saw losses widen to NKr32.6m from NKr5m in last time.
Domestic analysts estimate proceeds of the disposal will reach Dollars 170m.
About Dollars 120m will be used to pay off the bulk of the Dollars 220m
worth of debt of Vard's holding company. The rest will be used to service
remaining debt and cover overheads.
Vard is also seeking to dispose of just over 50 per cent of Miami-based
Kloster Cruise, its cruise business.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Decline in demand hits Kone

<TEXT>
KONE, the Finnish maker of elevators and cranes, said profits before taxes
and allocations declined in the first four months, to FM69m (Dollars 12.7m),
from FM78m at the same stage last year. It blamed the decline on falling
demand in Europe.
Kone said although it saw no signs of revival in demand in the rest of 1993,
it expected an improvement later in the year to produce a full-year profit
at 'nearly the same level' as 1992's FM479m.
Sales at Kone Elevators, which represent 73 per cent of group turnover, grew
16 per cent in the first four months, lifting overall sales to FM3.6bn, a 15
per cent improvement over last time. However, some two thirds of the growth
in sales were attributed to the near 20 per cent decline in the value of the
Finnish markka following its flotation.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ibos payment network set to link
with US banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO five US banks are this year expected to join the Ibos cross-border
payments network, operated jointly by a group of European banks. Their
decision is likely to start bringing the network into competition with the
Swift system that dominates European Community cross-border payments.
Ibos, started by Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander, will also
launch in autumn services aimed at small and medium-sized businesses,
allowing companies remote computer access to their overseas accounts.
The Ibos network links 2,500 branches in Europe owned by the two founding
partners, Credit Commercial de France, and Banco de Comercio e Industria in
Portugal. However, the group is negotiating with several US banks to link it
to branch networks there.
Such a link would boost traffic through the network considerably. There are
expected to be 23,000 transactions totalling Dollars 150m this year through
Ibos. The Ibos system allows transfers among accounts within seven seconds,
but the network is capable of handling up to 40,000 a day.
The Ibos partners are considering how to extend the network to the US, and
are likely to admit several banks to cover the country. One possibility is
that one bank will be licensed to offer Ibos services in each state, with
each participating bank holding several licences.
The Ibos network is loss-making, in contrast to the Swift network to which
all European banks have access and which had revenue of Dollars 350m in
1991. However, its partners expect it to enter profitability in about 18
months, and then achieve rapid growth.
The partners in Ibos - which stands for Inter Bank Online System - are also
negotiating with banks in Belgium, Austria, Holland and Germany to establish
partners in those countries. They expect to build a larger share of the
Dollars 12bn market when this is done.
Mr Norman McCluskie, managing director of Royal Bank of Scotland's
operations division, said the Ibos partners had so far concentrated on
ensuring the system worked reliably, Now, however, they expected strong
growth. 'We see ourselves in a very dramatic position,' he said.
Ibos is being marketed as being cheaper and faster than Express Swift
transfer via a central computer in Brussels. Customers who hold accounts at
the banks in the network are estimated to be able to transfer Pounds 3,000
(Dollars 4,620) for a fee of Pounds 6 through Ibos compared to Pounds 15 for
Express Swift.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Government to restrict
incentives on BT sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today announce the price for the first instalment of its
Pounds 5bn BT stake sale and will take a harder line on incentives than in
previous privatisations.
Discounts for private investors will be 10p a share for the second and third
instalments rather than 15p previously and the bonus for existing
shareholders will be 1-for-15 rather than 1-for-10 as before. The discount
for the first instalment will be announced later and will depend on demand.
The cutbacks have been prompted partly by the government's need to raise as
much cash as possible to counter its heavy public borrowing deficit.
Also, encouragement for institutions not to sell short and drive down the
underlying share price ahead of the issue pricing means that the discount
offered can be tighter.
Lower interest rates and lower returns from building societies increase the
attraction of BT shares and reduce the need to boost the sale artificially.
Advisers to the issue, which is being handled by SG Warburg, have signalled
that the price for the initial payment of the issue will be between 140p and
150p.
Although the issue is expected to be oversubscribed there are industry and
market worries which could drag down share prices afterwards.
The long-awaited Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into British Gas
will land on ministers' desks just after the issue and highlight regulatory
uncertainty. Also, some analysts believe the impact of wider competition,
particularly from cable operators, has been underestimated.
Meanwhile, the stock market is waiting to see the fate of the Pounds 1.3bn
Zeneca rights issue which closes on June 21. If a significant amount of
stock is left with the underwriters and the issue is considered a flop it
could depress the stock market and affect the BT sale.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hanson softens on voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, said it may be prepared to give in to
pressure from shareholders and retract proposals limiting their ability to
influence annual meetings.
Mr Martin Taylor, deputy chairman, said it was too late to remove the
proposals from the ballot for an extraordinary meeting to be held on June
25.
He said, however: 'When we come to review our articles next year we will see
if they need to be changed.'
Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the National
Association of Pension Funds, said the group had received similar assurances
from Hanson.
The proposals have provoked a storm of protest from two investor groups, the
NAPF and Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises
shareholders on corporate governance issues.
Ms Anne Simpson, PIRC managing director, is urging investors to vote against
the proposals. 'Companies should be finding ways to improve their
accountability to shareholders, not restricting their existing rights. We
consider it extremely important that Hanson does not set a precedent on this
issue.'
Some shareholders have complained that not only do the proposals severely
curtail their legitimate voting rights, but that Hanson has proposed them in
a fashion which makes voting against them difficult.
The offending proposals are contained in general amendments which seek
shareholder approval of a scrip issue - supported by investors - as well as
providing for some board changes deemed to improve the group's corporate
governance.
The new rules, which shareholders will vote on at an EGM, will eliminate the
right of shareholders to nominate a director to the board unless backers
represent at least 10 per cent of the vote.
Also, shareholders will lose the right to propose amendments to resolutions
at the meeting unless they represent 5 per cent of the share capital. In
addition, the chairman will have an explicit power to refuse to call for a
poll on any item by shareholders which in his opinion is 'irrelevant' or
'vexatious'.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Policy Portfolio poised for main
market with Pounds 11m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICY Portfolio, a market-maker in second hand endowment policies, is
planning to join the main market next month.
The company is likely to raise up to Pounds 5m via a placing, sponsored by
Charterhouse Tilney, and will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds
11m.
Endowment policies are frequently used in the UK as a means of repaying a
mortgage. Returns on so-called 'with profits' endowments can depend heavily
on a terminal bonus, which is only paid to those who keep up policies for
the full term, often 25 years.
Those who give up their policy before the full term normally receive a
'surrender value' determined by the life company. The second hand market
grew up as investors who were dissatisfied with surrender values sold their
policies to third parties, who intended to keep up the payments and receive
the full benefit of the terminal bonus.
Policy Portfolio, a member of FIMBRA, was founded in 1988 by Mr Isaac Rubin
who had himself invested in second hand policies in the early 1980s.
The group buys policies from investors and attempts to sell them at a
profit. To date, the group has financed itself from bank borrowings and the
issue will give it the capital base to expand.
Pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 245,000 in the year to March 31 1991
to an estimated Pounds 817,000, on turnover of Pounds 7.91m, in the year to
March 31 1993.
The market for second hand policies was about Pounds 80m last year, giving
Policy Portfolio a market share of 10 per cent, behind Foster &amp; Cranfield
and Beale Dobie - part of the quoted Hambro Insurance Services. The second
hand market is expanding rapidly in response to the large number of
endowment policies sold in the 1980s.

maker, in the year to January 31.
Directors said that the year had been extremely difficult, but trading had

Two purchases had been made since the period end, with one already having an
effect and the benefits of the other expected later in the year.
Turnover was Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 12.2m) and losses were after exceptional
costs of Pounds 141,000 (Pounds 71,000).
Losses per share came out at 0.76p (0.4p) while an unchanged single final of
0.1p is proposed.

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Somic returns to the black with
Pounds 81,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cost reductions enabled Somic, a maker of yarns and woven fabrics, to return
to profits in the year to March 31 with Pounds 81,000, compared with losses
of Pounds 114,000.
Mr Richard Blackburn, chairman and managing director, said that turnover
remained depressed but planned reductions in costs had helped ensure a
return to profits in the second half.
The result was also helped by higher investment and interest income of
Pounds 106,000 (Pounds 73,000).
Turnover was Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 3.5m). Earnings per share were 3.86p
(2.83p losses) and the proposed single final dividend is 1.5p (1p).

FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sharp decline to Pounds 0.22m
for A Cohen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A reduction in pre-tax profits from Pounds 783,000 to Pounds 215,000 was
announced by A Cohen for 1992.
Turnover for the company, which makes non-ferrous metal ingots and is
involved in the reclamation and trading of recyclable material, declined to
Pounds 78.4m (Pounds 83.7m).
The company blamed recession in all its markets for the result and the large
imbalance between demand for and supply of aluminium.
The deficit after tax was Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 343,000), equivalent to
losses per share of 31.68p (21.2p). The proposed final dividend is
maintained, however, at 3.4p, giving a reduced total of 6.8p (10p).

FT  14 JUN 93 / Telephone broker to float next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARELINK Investment Services, the telephone-based stockbroker, is to float
at the end of next month. The group is expected to be valued at more than
Pounds 30m.
Around Pounds 5m of new money is to be raised which will be invested in new
services.
Sharelink, which currently specialises in equities and traded options, is
looking at expand-ing into insurance and bank-ing.
Mr David Jones, chief executive, said: 'The retail financial services market
is full of opportunities; after pioneering the use of the telephone in
selling shares we are now looking at moving into other areas.'
He confirmed that this includes the rapidly growing telephone insurance
business.
Direct Line, the company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland which
specialises in telephone insurance, recently trebled first-half profits to
Pounds 15m.
Sharelink's two biggest shareholders, Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and the
British Coal pension fund, both of which have a 32 per cent stake, are
expected to sell around half their shareholding.
Mr Jones, who started the business in 1987, is expected to sell 25 per cent
of his 20 per cent holding making him a millionaire just six years after he
invested Pounds 4,000 in the business.
He increased his shareholding after a management buyout from the original
institutional backers, BT and Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based
stockbroker.
The company's other shareholders are the employees with 10 per cent and
Eagle Trust with 6 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31, 1993 have jumped from Pounds 1m to
Pounds 3.5m on sales of Pounds 14m. The company is based in Birmingham with
more than 300 employees.
In the past it has thrived on privatisations but during the last year it has
mainly concentrated on equities.
A number of new issues have been brought forward before the government sale
of its remaining 21.9 per cent stake in BT which is to take place in the
middle of July.
However, Mr Jones believes the BT sale will not affect his float.
'There is plenty of money in the new issue markets,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: A test for the public services in poorer
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE residents of Delhi and much of northern India were looking for
scapegoats after power cuts which this week left them sweltering for many
hours without lights, fans, coolers or air-conditioners.
The immediate cause of their distress was a surge in demand for electricity
which overwhelmed the generation and transmission network.
That India, like many developing countries, does not produce enough
electricity is well known. India's Ministry of Power estimates that in the
year to the end of March the shortages amounted to around 9 per cent of the
country's total needs and 18 per cent of its peak requirement.
In the past, the standard response to power shortages in developing
countries has been to build more power stations. In the late 1980s, India
was building an annual average of 4,000 megawatts (MW) of generating
capacity a year - the equivalent of four large power stations. By March
1992, total capacity in the public sector (which accounts for the vast
majority of power) stood at 69,000MW.
However, in the 1990s, capital has been much harder to find. The public
sector construction programme has almost ground to a halt and India is
seeking private investors, including foreign companies, to take up the
slack. Even if this initiative brings results, private companies will not
contribute to a significant increase in power supplies until the late 1990s,
given the long lead-times in making such large investments.
This gloomy prospect has forced the Indian authorities to concentrate upon
doing something that should have been done a long time ago - making better
use of existing plant. Indian power stations typically run below 60 per cent
cent capacity. Also, 23 per cent of the power generated is lost in
transmission - through theft or faulty equipment. While the efficiency of
stations has improved in the past decade, transmission losses have actually
increased.
Acknowledging the scale of the problem, the World Bank, the principal
supplier of low-interest loans for power schemes in developing countries,
has slowed new credits for new power stations and is lending India Dollars
350m (Pounds 227m) to fund improvements in the existing network.
The shortcomings in the Indian power supply industry highlight a general
problem afflicting developing countries. A lot of time and money is lavished
on new capital investments and not enough on maintaining the efficiency of
existing capital, particularly in the public sector. What is true for power
stations is often also true for roads and railways, pipes and sewers, and
public buildings.
One reason for this misallocation of resources is political: politicians,
who have the last word in spending decisions, prefer to put their names to
new schemes than to renovating the projects of their predecessors. Such
temptations are not unique to developing nations: the problem is to increase
incentives for the good management of existing resources.
Many countries have opted for privatisation - private owners are much more
likely than the state to ensure that capital is exploited to its full
potential.
But in some countries, including India, full-scale privatisation is, at
best, a distant prospect. Aside from the reluctance of politicians and
officials to surrender administrative power, there are very real concerns
about the regulation of private companies entrusted with essential services.
For example, privatising the water supply in a drought-prone country such as
India would be politically impossible.
The only alternative is to cajole public sector managers to become more
efficient. The government can try to apply pressure, but frequently
politicians' priorities will not always square with the goals of efficient
management. In India. much electricity is stolen by residents of illegal
slums, who attach wires to overhead cables. Since slum-dwellers have votes
there is little political incentive to deprive them of free power.
The World Bank and other aid donors try to improve the running of public
services by directing funds towards operations which are well managed, at
the expense of those which are not. But there is a limit to which outside
agencies can become involved in such detailed choices without being accused
of bullying and interfering with national sovereignty. Also, the
worst-managed units are often in poor regions, precisely those which most
need foreign aid. In India, the most efficient power stations were those in
the state of Maharashtra, including wealthy Bombay, which ran at 58 per cent
capacity. Those in deprived West Bengal managed only 28 per cent.
Another way for foreign donors to influence change might be to supply more
information to consumers in India and other developing countries. The means
might be to prepare league tables comparing the efficiency of the service
delivery in different states. The World Bank and other international
agencies already do this for many criteria, notably GNP and GNP per capita,
and for the production totals of individual industries, including
electricity generation.
The emphasis in such data is on volume. It would be possible to supplement
the figures with statistics which measure the quality of what is produced.
As far as public services are concerned, the electricity industry is a
suitable starting point because production is concentrated in relatively few
units, so collecting information may not be too difficult.
Capacity utilisation and transmission losses might be appropriate
indicators. Other possibilities include capacity use in the water industry,
average delays on railway journeys, flight cancellations by domestic
airlines and the number of attempted telephone calls made for one successful
connection.
Such figures would be of more than academic interest. Properly packaged they
would be a valuable tool both for the officials who run public services and
for consumers.
The popularity of such inter-country comparisons is amply demonstrated by
the success of the United Nations Development Programme's annual report on
human development which is in its fourth year and sells 100,000 copies.

FT  14 JUN 93 / BAe benefits as it brings its head out of the clouds: A
change of culture at the UK's biggest export manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN CAHILL flew in last week to his first Paris Air Show as chairman of
British Aerospace on a regular British Airways flight.
'I'm a small businessman and I simply cannot justify coming here on a
private BAe 125 jet at a cost of Pounds 6,000 an hour,' he said, watching
the noisy flight displays from BAe's entertainment chalet at the world's
biggest air show.
Since he was brought in to lead the UK's biggest export manufacturer a year
ago, Mr Cahill has sought to instil the same sort of 'hair shirt' mentality
that prevailed in his old company, the BTR industrial conglomerate.
Although the company is by no means out of the woods, and has been buffeted
like the rest of the industry by recession in the civil aircraft market and
contraction in the defence business, it had more to celebrate in Paris than
most aerospace companies.
It was one of the few to announce a big order: for Hawk trainer-light attack
aircraft worth Pounds 500m from Indonesia. Its shares climbed over the 380p
mark for the first time since its ill-fated rights issue 18 months ago,
which provoked a savage boardroom battle, the resignation of the chairman,
Professor Sir Roland Smith, and ultimately the arrival of Mr Cahill.
The company also returned in the FT-SE 100 index after a nine-month absence.
Last September, BAe's shares hit a low of 107p. On Friday, they closed at
410p. This sharp rise is making Mr Cahill a little nervous. 'It's getting
too hot now: I'd hoped the share price wouldn't go through 400 so quickly,'
he said.
For Mr Cahill the reason the company is returning to favour in the City is
simple. 'We simply had to establish credibility: we had to tell the world
what we were doing and then deliver the goods.'
The strategy itself has not changed. What has changed, according to Mr Dick
Evans, BAe's chief executive, is the internal chemistry. 'No one guy can
lead a company of this size which is very diverse and has a big political
element because governments are our customers. But to be successful we had
to have a team of people who were able to work together,' he explained,
adding that this had not been the case under Sir Roland.
But Mr Cahill has quietly brought a change of attitude and culture in the
company. From the beginning, he sought to introduce at BAe the same concept
of open management, accountability, transparency and tight cost controls
that BTR adopted.
In the early 1960s, Mr Cahill recalled, BTR had a bad habit of always
predicting more than it could achieve. The result was that the company lost
money twice in three years. 'We then sat down and said: we must be
predictable, reliable, an open book. BAe for many years was a very private
company and we have to show that we have nothing to hide,' he said.
BAe's basic strategy is 'to support and protect' its main defence business,
he emphasised. To do this, the company, which has been cash negative in the
last few years, had to become cash positive again.
'Cash is our mission. Our plan is to get overheads down, turn inventories
back into cash and sell off non core assets,' he explained. Three
significant developments have recently helped revive confidence in the
company's Pounds 5bn a year defence business: the UK government's commitment
to the European Fighter Aircraft; Saudi Arabia's intention to go ahead with
a new order for an additional 48 Tornado combat aircraft; and the
negotiations to merge BAe's guided missiles activities into a joint company
with those of the French Matra group.
In the commercial aircraft sector, BAe is focusing on its 20 per cent stake
in the European Airbus airliner programme. After establishing a joint
venture company with Taiwan Aerospace for its loss-making regional jet
business, the company is now seeking a similar partnership with other
international manufacturers for its Jetstream and ATP turbopropeller
regional aircraft activities which have been regrouped at Prestwick in
Scotland.
And two weeks ago, it sold for Pounds 250m its BAe 125 executive jet
business to Raytheon of the US. The decision helped the City of London
realise the true worth of the company, Mr Cahill said. 'The corporate jet
business with Pounds 300m a year turnover and Pounds 25m pre-tax profits
represented only 3 per cent of our total sales. We sold it for more than a
quarter of our market capitalisation.'
In any case, the trend in the hard-pressed commercial aircraft sector as
well as in the military was towards ever-increasing consolidation and
collaboration. 'We have to rationalise and we won't be building aeroplanes
on our own any more,' Mr Cahill said.
'It is almost inevitable that in the US there will be two military aircraft
and one large commercial aeroplane manufacturer, against just the
possibility of one of each in Europe,' Mr Evans forecast.
In the longer term, a similar consolidation is likely to take place in the
car business, according to Mr Cahill. At present Rover remained an important
component of his group. 'The objective is to get Rover into profit and we
hope to see Rover moving into profit this year,' he said.
But what will eventually happen to the car group? 'Who knows?' said Mr
Cahill. 'At the moment we have no plans, but I could see the car industry
concentrated one day into six companies: two in the US, two in Japan, two in
Europe - and one will not be called Rover.'
Although he believes the company has now found some badly-needed stability,
Mr Evans warned that the process of restructuring was by no means over.
'We are now finally getting the organisation up and running again. But
closures and redundancies have also created a lot of uncertainties and has
made the job even more complex,' conceded Mr Evans. Over the last three
years, BAe has shed about 45,000 jobs. 'And the process is not over,' warned
Mr Evans.
But for a short moment at least, BAe and its 'wise old sage of a chairman
who has seen it all before', as Mr Evans described him, are having a party
in Paris.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Italy to sell off financial services group
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Mobiliare Italiano, the big long-term lending and financial
services group controlled by the Italian treasury, is to be floated
following the collapse of sale talks to a group of public-sector savings
banks.
The government will sell the treasury's 50 per cent stake in IMI, and a
further 9.3 per cent owned by the Ina state insurance agency. Mr Piero
Barucci, the treasury minister, said he hoped a first 20 per cent tranche of
IMI's shares could be floated by the year-end.
The 20 per cent stake could be worth about L1,600bn (Pounds 700m), based on
the valuation of between L7,600bn and L8,000bn for IMI made by SG Warburg,
the UK merchant bank. Warburg and IMI itself have now been given the mandate
by the treasury to prepare the way for flotation.
IMI is one of Italy's biggest financial institutions, specialising in
long-term corporate lending. It also has a big securities trading
capability, and has in recent years branched out into insurance and retail
banking.
The failure of the sale talks means the government now has three big banks
on its disposal list. Last year, it announced plans to privatise Credito
Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank, while Banca Commerciale Italiana,
another prestigious financial institution also based in Milan, is due to be
sold.
The change in strategy over IMI came after the breakdown of talks with a
group of savings banks, led by Milan's Cariplo, over the issue of price. In
a terse statement, the government said the banks' offer was 'inadequate both
as far as the price and the means of payment is concerned'.
While some analysts greeted the decision to float IMI as a boost for
'transparency,' it represents a severe setback to both the treasury and
Cariplo.
The government had been hoping to raise about L3,800bn from the transaction.
IMI, which had group net profits of L443bn and a loan book of about
L51,000bn in 1992, is one of the most attractive assets on the government's
privatisation list.
Purchasing IMI would have given Cariplo, always the leading force among
potential purchasers, a boost. Although it is strong in retail banking and
deposit-taking, Cariplo's presence in investment banking and securities
trading is weaker, especially abroad.

BRITISH institutional investors are showing more interest in domestic
property investment than at any time in the last three years, according to a
new survey.
The Smith New Court/Gallup Survey of Fund Managers for June showed that 22
per cent of those surveyed planned to increase their holdings of UK
property, the highest level since the survey began in July 1990. Last month,
12 per cent said they intended to make UK property investments and in
February, none was prepared to make such a move.
The survey, conducted on June 7th and 8th, covered 95 institutions with
Pounds 661bn under management.
A balance of 6 per cent of managers planned to increase their holdings of UK
equities, down from 18 per cent in May and the lowest level for planned
investment in British shares this year.
In other asset categories, fund managers were less enthusiastic about
foreign equities than a month ago, with a balance of only 6 per cent
planning to increase European exposures, 9 per cent raising Japanese
weightings and 24 per cent increasing investments in other areas. In May,
the weightings were 13, 24 and 28 per cent respectively.
There has been an increase in the popularity of index-linked gilts since
March. In the June poll, a balance of 8 per cent planned to raise
investments in that sector, up from 1 per cent in March.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Economist succeeds Demirel as premier

<TEXT>
MRS TANSU Ciller, a 47-year-old academic economist, will be sworn in today
as Turkey's new prime minister. She becomes the first woman to lead the
predominantly Moslem country and one party delegate said: 'She is the only
candidate who can represent Turkey in a European context.'
Having resigned as economics minister last week to contest the leadership of
the conservative True Path party (DYP), Mrs Ciller emerged unchallenged on
the second ballot of 1,169 DYP delegates. She had fallen just short of an
absolute majority against two other contenders in the first round. Mr Ismet
Sezgin, interior minister, and Mr Koksal Toptan, education minister, then
withdrew.
The new premier succeeds Mr Suleyman Demirel, whose accession to the
presidency last month created yesterday's leadership contest. With the death
in April of then President Turgut Ozal, and Mr Demirel as president, Mrs
Ciller's election marks a watershed in Turkish politics.
Her emergence is unlikely to signal a great shift in Turkey's traditional
pro-western foreign policy, although she is expected to accelerate economic
reforms.
A wealthy Istanbul economics professor, Mrs Ciller is seen as the party's
best hope to restore its tired image ahead of the vital municipal elections
next year and the general election which must be held before 1996.
She told delegates that they were 'writing the first words on a sheet of new
white paper'. A relative unknown in DYP ranks, who entered parliament only
at the last election, she owes her rise to Mr Demirel, who picked her as an
economic adviser. However, the president will need to counter a public
impression that he opposed her candidacy.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies, expected to play an important role in reconstructing
Europe, have acquired a mere three businesses in east Germany through the
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency - only one more acquisition than
companies from India and the same number as Singaporean companies.
The total is a disappointment for the Treuhand and an embarrassment for the
Japanese government, which had suggested, at the fall of the Berlin Wall,
that the country's current account surplus would be recycled in the
reconstruction of the region.
Having opened a Tokyo office two years ago in expectation of interest in the
estimated 13,500 German companies on the block, the Treuhand has learned
valuable lessons about Japanese corporate culture and the receding Japanese
enthusiasm for Europe.
The Japanese total of three acquisitions, two in the glass industry and one
in car servicing, compares with the 78 east German factories acquired by UK
companies and the 54 bought by US companies.
'It's quite amazing, isn't it?' lamented Mr Dietrich von Stackelberg, head
of the Treuhand's east Asian operations. 'The timing was wrong. With the
collapse of Japan's economic bubble, we have seen an increasing reluctance
to invest in Europe. Their operations are contracting.'
Facing criticism over Japan's huge current account surplus, the government
had argued that investment in the reconstruction of Europe would recycle the
surplus, which has more than trebled over the past two years. In the same
period, new Japanese direct investment in Germany has fallen 38 per cent.
Mr Nobuyuki Nagashima, assistant director for Europe at the Japan External
Trade Organisation, said unification coincided with the slowing of Japan's
economy, while companies were unfamiliar with east German companies and
reluctant to risk funds.
Mr von Stackelberg suggested that the agency's experience highlighted an
important difference in corporate culture between the US and Japan, where
controversial, friction creating decisions, such as staff cuts, are very
slow to be made.
'The companies were basically restructuring cases, and we have found that
Japanese companies are reluctant to get involved in this sort of operation,'
Mr von Stackelberg said.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Campbell aims to clinch third Conservative term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA's ruling Progressive Conservative party last night chose Ms Kim
Campbell as its leader and the country's first woman prime minister.
Ms Campbell, a blunt-speaking 46-year-old lawyer from Vancouver, won against
four other candidates on the second ballot of a party convention in Ottawa.
She secured 53 per cent of the votes cast by 3,452 delegates on the final
ballot. Her nearest rival was Mr Jean Charest, the environment minister. The
other three candidates withdrew after the first ballot.
Ms Campbell had originally been regarded as a firm favourite to win the
contest because of her credentials as a bilingual woman candidate from
British Columbia. But her lead narrowed before the convention after she was
characterised as a prickly intellectual whose command of French was not as
fluent as first thought.
Ms Campbell, currently defence minister, will take over from Mr Brian
Mulroney and announce a new cabinet within 10 days.
Her immediate priority is to secure a third consecutive mandate for the
Conservatives in the next general election, which a senior party official
said would probably be called in September. The Conservatives and the
opposition Liberals are running neck-and-neck in opinion polls.
Ms Campbell, who was hailed during the convention as 'a new sensation' in
Canadian politics, indicated that she would try to distance herself from the
record of the unpopular Mulroney government, without making any radical
changes in policy.
In her keynote speech, she promised 'a new agenda for government and a new
approach to politics'. She pledged 'not to duck our problems but to confront
them'. But she has given few specifics, beyond a commitment to eliminate the
federal budget deficit, which totalled close to CDollars 35bn (Pounds
17.8bn) last year, within five years. She also pledged to 'reduce the size
and scale of government'.
Ms Campbell has backed the North American Free Trade Agreement between the
US, Canada and Mexico. A senior adviser said yesterday, however, that her
early initiatives may include an adjustment programme to help workers whose
jobs are threatened.

FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is now more than three months since Barclays cut its dividend and
promised to find a new chief executive to work alongside Mr Andrew Buxton,
the bank's chairman. Since then, there has been no news on the chief
executive, but the share price has risen by 20 per cent. There is a risk
that this recovery will calm the institutions down. They are more inclined
to make a fuss when they are losing money, but a responsible role in
corporate governance requires a consistent longer-term approach. The
installation of a better structure at Barclays is a project worth seeing
through.
It would be unfair to expect Barclays to rush. The choice is a difficult one
but it gets harder as time goes by. Not only would a new chief executive
have to work with existing senior managers who may be miffed at the
appointment of an outsider. The better Mr Buxton is established as executive
chairman, the harder it will be for a new chief executive to carve out a
meaningful role - and the greater the risk in accepting the job.
If it is not to face the loss of more top executives, Barclays needs a
candidate of conspicuously higher calibre than the average senior clearing
banker. One answer might be to look for a non-banker, but it would make more
sense to appoint such a person as chairman. Sir Peter Walters became
chairman at Midland, while Mr Brian Pearse, the hands-on banker, was made
chief executive. The task at Barclays might be easier if the bank was made
more manageable by splitting it up. BZW, for example, is plenty big enough
to stand alone.

FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Water sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The inability of the water companies to make a decent return on unregulated
business has been a notable feature of the results season. The companies'
response is that investment in areas such as waste disposal and process
engineering is a hedge against tougher regulation after next year's review.
Whether or not that proves correct, the relationship between the regulated
and unregulated sides of the business should be as transparent as possible.
On the surface, water companies work under stricter rules on cross-subsidies
than other privatised utilities. Licence amendments introduced last year
explicitly outlawed any form of subsidy passing across the regulatory
divide. But the system of policing so far has been anything but foolproof.
By publishing new guidelines on transfer pricing last month, Ofwat
recognised as much. The dividends paid by the utility companies to their
quoted parents remain a grey area. Northumbrian drew Pounds 21.8m from its
utility last year, but paid out rather less to shareholders. Its unregulated
business lost money.
All credit to Northumbrian for reporting the dividend figures with its
preliminary results. Other water companies would do well to follow suit. One
can only hope the regulator takes such transfers into account when setting
pricing limits for the second half of the decade. If Ofwat gets its sums
right this time around, there will be precious little left over to pass up
the line.

FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The message from the money markets is that holding D-Marks is now more risky
than holding French francs. While the ubiquitous Mr George Soros might be
blamed for spreading the notion that the D-Mark is due for a period of
weakness, other factors are at work. The dire state of the German economy
undermines faith in the Bundesbank's ability to defend the D-Mark.
Supportive statements from the authorities last week notably failed to lift
the currency.
With the D-Mark wounded, France has a chance to cut rates without worrying
too much about strains within the ERM. Since recession in France is at least
as painful as in Germany, it should make the most of the opportunity. The
change in sentiment towards the franc this year is a reminder of how fickle
the foreign exchange market can be. Should the German economic slide prove
less protracted than the pessimists believe, or should France's good
intentions on inflation be seen to waver, the D-Mark could start to impose
again.
It is far from clear that the D-Mark has been deposed as the anchor of the
ERM. French bonds still yield more than German bonds at longer maturities.
That reflects the short track record of the Bank of France as a paragon of
monetary virtue. Until it can rival the credibility of the Bundesbank over a
long-term horizon, D-Mark weakness looks more like a window of opportunity
than the start of a new era. If 10-year French bond yields fall below
German, it will be time to think again.

FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Stable conditions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Controlling market prices around the time of new issues has long been a
thorny problem for investment banks. Any attempt to support the price of an
issue is a form of market manipulation, though it is often justified on the
grounds that it helps maintain an orderly market. Such stabilisation is now
controlled by strict SIB rules which forbid, for example, the lead manager
to buy in securities above their issue price. So in the Zeneca rights issue,
the manager Warburg, which has been a notable bidder for shares above the
600p issue price, is presumably acting for clients, since buying for its own
book would be difficult to distinguish from stabilisation.
The rules on stabilisation are, however, quite specific and focus on the
lead manager buying securities immediately after the issue. In the case of
the BT3 offer, Warburg is encouraging institutions to buy shares ahead of
the float by offering preferential allocations to those that buy, while
penalising excessive sellers. This will tend to support the price and smooth
the absorption of the issue. In that sense at least it is analogous to
stabilisation, for while the lead manager is not directly supporting the
price, it is encouraging others to do so.
If the incentive proves popular, it could significantly influence the BT
share price. With stabilisation, at least the members of the syndicate know
the extent of intervention, whereas in this case not even the lead manager
is fully aware of the market impact of the measure. Currently there is a
grey area between acceptable smoothing and an unacceptable false market.
Perhaps the SIB should consider including such incentives in wider
stabilisation rules to ensure that the market is transparent, as well as
orderly.

The total is a disappointment for the Treuhand and an embarrassment for the

Mr von Stackelberg is due to depart later this year, and the lack of deals
means there is little reason for the Treuhand to maintain Tokyo support
staff.
He suggested that the agency's experience highlighted an important
difference in corporate culture between the US and Japan, where
controversial, friction creating decisions, such as staff cuts, are very
slow to be made.
'The companies were basically restructuring cases, and we have found that
Japanese companies are reluctant to get involved in this sort of operation.
Certain unpopular decisions have be taken, and they don't like doing that,'
Mr von Stackelberg said.
The Treuhand also discovered that business contacts are not made through
advertising in the Japanese financial press. Mr von Stackelberg said that
there was 'almost zero response' to advertisements. Most of the agency's
contacts were made through Japanese trading houses and banks, which passed
on details of potential deals to their clients.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Business ethics and China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment is pouring into China. As the reports on page 2 indicate,
China's growth offers such promise that businesses have to consider the
opportunities. The risks include huge unknowns. How will the country be
governed after the octogenarian leadership disappears? To what extent will
economic reform bring political change, and will this cause instability? For
how long is China's economy doomed to a lurching boom-bust cycle?
There is, however, a further question. Is it morally defensible for
businesses to seek profit in a country still firmly controlled by a
Communist party which ruthlessly and shamelessly stamps upon its people?
This is the government which showed in Tiananmen Square four years ago that
it was prepared to stop at nothing to hold onto power. Millions of people
languish in its labour camps, the products of their labour often sold
abroad.
The issue should not be brushed aside as a concern of politicians, but not
of business. Human rights are a matter for each individual. The decisions of
each company's directors matter.
The strongest argument for participation in China's boom is that the contact
now occurring daily between ordinary Chinese and thousands of foreign
business people is a potent agent encouraging stable economic and political
development from the inside. Western business practices and ethics are being
communicated inside China as a practical matter, not as part of a sermon.
The growth of private enterprise and individual expression is being fostered
as values encouraged by state control wither. This is the 'peaceful
evolution' the Communist hardliners fear.
Such changes occur only gradually and can be frustrated. But consider the
risks, both for a billion Chinese and for the world, of chaotic governmental
collapse similar to that in the former Soviet bloc. The world cannot expect
western-style democracy suddenly to emerge in China. It is more realistic to
expect slow progress towards greater pluralism in government - and it is in
the interests of the rest of the world that change occurs in a reasonably
calm atmosphere.
The opening of China's economy is bringing broader political and social
changes. The monolith is breaking down. Yet it is an over-simplification to
suggest that the party's new dogma - the socialist market economy - is
simply capitalism by another name. Businesses negotiating joint ventures are
usually dealing directly with official bodies, and bureaucrats still control
the supply of many essential inputs. The success of a venture depends on
having good connections within the system.
The moral question is, therefore, not easy to answer. Putting sound business
principles into practice is the best foundation for assessing investment in
China. Experience shows that the successful investments are those which the
foreigner thoroughly investigates and carefully oversees. First-hand
scrutiny of a venture is not only to be recommended on business grounds, but
it should also be used to satisfy the investor that it does not bring
involvement in unacceptable practices such as prison labour. Companies, such
as Levi Strauss, which have chosen to reject involvement in China because of
the country's human rights record, are entitled to respect. Such decisions
are, however, part of a carefully positioned corporate image and as such do
not necessarily apply to others.
Foreign business presence in China is part of the west's overall policy of
engaging in dialogue at every level, seeking to foster stable economic
development while at the same time pressing China to conform to
international standards of behaviour. Companies which do take the plunge
deserve the support of their governments.

Much tut-tutting is abuzz behind the BBC World Service microphones at the
absence of former boss John Tusa's name from the Queen's Birthday honours
list. Having been denied a chance of even competing for the job of BBC
director-general, Tusa has now failed to get the customary recognition for a
job well done.
Former Bush House occupants, such as Gerard Mansell and Austen Kark, picked
up CBEs, and some thought that Tusa might even have been in line for his K.
During his six-year stint, the World Service won praise from listeners
ranging from President Gorbachev to the Beirut hostages.
Admittedly, BBC-types have not been collecting quite so many honours under
the new regime at Number 10. But Tusa has gone on to be master of a
Cambridge College, and in his 32 years at the Beeb has probably done as much
for public service broadcasting as the likes of recently knighted Michael
Checkland, David Frost, and Robin Day.
Could it be that BBC chairman Duke Hussey, whose wife is the Queen's
lady-in-waiting, somehow forgot to mention Tusa in dispatches?

When it comes to filling the chief executive's post at Barclays, the NatWest
directors John Melbourn and John Tugwell may not be such hot tips as many in
the City of London believe.
Earlier this year, Barclays asked executive searchers Spencer Stuart to draw
up a short-list for the job. The headhunters, however, had a longstanding
relationship with NatWest, and accordingly asked the established client if
they could take on the Barclays assignment.
NatWest said it had no objection, so long as the headhunter did not feel it
faced a conflict of interest - which of course was a warning to steer clear
of NatWest staff when approaching candidates. Whereupon Spencer Stuart
intimated that no one from the Action Bank would be on the list.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Dream team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The behind-the-scenes politicking over Jacques Attali's future at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is degenerating into farce.
Persuading the 59-year-old Ernie Stern, the respected number two at the
World Bank, to take the less important number two job at the EBRD is almost
as bad an idea as maintaining the status quo.
Why on earth recruit a career bureaucrat whose speciality is managing a
third world development bank to run a supposedly entrepreneurial type of
institution whose prime aim is to work with the private sector? Sir William
Ryrie, head of the World Bank's private sector arm, the International
Finance Corporation, would seem better qualified.
Even worse, offering Stern a megabuck transfer fee is hardly the behaviour
expected of an organisation already under censure for its profligacy.
Nevertheless if the EBRD's owners really are intent on bagging Stern, it
ought surely to be part of a move to replace Attali. One possibility would
be to recall Citicorp vice-chairman Onno Rudding, the former Dutch finance
minister who wanted the EBRD job just as badly as Frere Jacques.
Then the EBRD might have the beginnings of a dream team.

Time was when being a life president meant something. In return for giving
up the keys to the chairman's suite, corporate grandees were rewarded with a
title, secretaries, free lunches and continued use of chauffeur-driven
limos.
But outgoing Hammerson chairman Sydney Mason, one of the grand old men of
British property, is not even being allowed to keep his office when he
inherits his title after Hammerson's annual meeting today. Indeed, he will
be lucky if he can even find his name in future annual reports.
How he must envy Lord King, British Airways' newly created president. One of
the rumoured perks of being an ex-chairman of a big airline is a lifetime's
free flying on any of the world's main airlines.

<TEXT>
Over years of being bombarded with management jargon, such as 'Soft-S
fronted structure initiating', Observer has developed a rule of thumb. The
only thing more dangerous than deciding that such gobbledegook can't have
any meaning is to assume you know what it is.
Take for instance an upcoming phrase increasingly apt to be overheard in
trendy executive suites: people being referred to as what sounds like 'Hi
Macs'.
It would be totally mistaken to leap to the conclusion that those so
described are either Americans with a cheerful hail-fellow-well-met
disposition, or Scottish aristocrats. Nor are they being insultingly likened
to putrid hamburgers.
Even seeing the phrase in its correct spelling - 'High Machs' - can raise
confusion, since it could be taken to mean folk apt to rush around at
supersonic speeds.
But the real reference is to people who are highly Machiavellian in
deceptively manipulating those around them. Psychologists test this
characteristic by asking how far people agree with statements such as:
'Never tell anyone the real reason you did something unless it's useful to
do so.'
Oh, and just in case anyone doesn't already know it, 'Soft-S fronted
structure initiating' means much the same thing: conning people into
behaving as you wish.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Survival of the slimmest: The US defence industry is
undergoing rapid change to adapt to its role in the post-cold war world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lonesome superpower in a world without other superpowers, the US is
grappling with a new defence dilemma: how to spend less on weapons and still
sustain the industrial and technological capabilities that lie behind its
unquestioned military supremacy.
As long as the cold war lasted, defence spending was high enough for this
hardly to be an issue. But the question is in sharp relief now that the
Clinton administration has committed itself explicitly to a policy of
protecting the 'defence industrial base', from submarines to military
satellites.
The US defence industry, with 2.75m employees, is already undergoing
significant changes to contend with the shrinking home market. In today's
dollars, the US was spending Dollars 120bn a year in 1985 procuring military
hardware. The figure for the 1994 fiscal year, starting in October, is just
Dollars 45.5bn.
In the past year, Martin Marietta, the missile, space and electronics group,
has taken over General Electric's aerospace business; Hughes, part of
General Motors, has absorbed General Dynamics' missile activities; Loral,
which had already bought Ford Motor's aerospace division, has also swallowed
the LTV missile business; McDonnell Douglas has put its helicopter and laser
operations up for disposal; and General Dynamics has gone on to sell its
electronics operation to the Carlyle group and its military aircraft
division - maker of the F-16 - to Lockheed.
Not persuaded by the idea of 'conversion', General Dynamics has chosen to
become, instead of a Dollars 10bn-a-year defence company, a Dollars
3.5bn-a-year defence company.
'I would guess by the end of this century we'll see an industry that has
maybe a third of the number of competitors in each category as there are
now,' says Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta. 'There has to
be a consolidation.' In some sectors, he says, it may not make sense to have
competition at all.
The Pentagon has already indicated it plans to keep 'one, not two' submarine
production lines. US submarines, all nuclear-powered, are now built at
General Dynamics' Electric Boat division at Groton, Connecticut, and at
Tenneco's Newport News yard in Virginia. But current plans mean a gap of at
least two years in building work before a new Centurion class comes on
stream around the turn of the century.
The question is whether it is worth ordering an extra submarine to keep one
facility open, an effective subsidy of about Dollars 1.5bn a year. Against
that has to be set the time it would take to reconstitute a production line
once it had closed.
Mr John Deutch, under-secretary for acquisition, has promised special
treatment for 'unique' industries such as this, which have no overlap with
civil business. Munitions are a similar case. 'We strongly feel you need to
build fences around them, protect them and nourish them,' Mr Deutch told a
recent congressional sub-committee.
In combat aircraft, a new shape is emerging in the industry, with just two
companies - McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed - taking primary roles in
designing and manufacturing fighters. The past few months, in which Lockheed
has taken over the mile-long F-16 assembly line at Fort Worth, Texas, have
'fundamentally transformed the landscape for military aircraft in the US',
according Mr Dan Tellep, Lockheed's chairman and chief executive.
At least two new fighters are expected to survive an urgent Pentagon rethink
on tactical aircraft requirements. The US air force and US navy have no
fewer than four projects under way. Putting all of them into production
would break the budget.
Priority looks likely to go to the new top-of-the-range fighter, the
Lockheed-led F-22 - although probably in reduced numbers - and a new navy
variant of McDonnell Douglas's F/A-18 Hornet. These are the projects most
vital for both companies. Other plans for a sophisticated new navy strike
aircraft and a multi-role successor to the F-16 may be put off until well
into the next century.
The verdict is expected to be the first result from a so-called bottom-up
review, due by late summer, into the full range of US defence requirements.
The new Pentagon team has taken on a big task - especially since it is still
only part of a team. Many of the important civilian posts at the department
are still unfilled, and only a handful of those named have been confirmed by
the Senate. Almost five months into the administration there is still an air
of improvisation. People dealing with the Pentagon find it exasperating. Mr
Lawrence Korb, who was an assistant secretary of defence in the transition
between the Carter and Reagan administrations and is now at the Brookings
Institution think-tank in Washington, says: 'This is the worst I've ever
seen.'
Lack of assistants is only one of the troubles complicating the task of Mr
Les Aspin, defence secretary. Among the others are a heart problem,
controversy over gay rights in the military, the aftermath of the 1991 naval
flyers' sex rampage known as the Tailhook affair, and military discomfort
over the government-wide pay freeze planned next year.
Mr Aspin's rushed first budget - which he calls 'treading water' - is just a
trimmed version of the one he inherited from the Bush administration. Apart
from pruning funds for missile defences, the down-to-earth remnant of
President Ronald Reagan's far-fetched Strategic Defence Initiative, it has
maintained funding levels for all the main armament programmes. The big
changes will come in the following three years.
The budget has already come down from over Dollars 300bn a year at the start
of the decade to Dollars 263bn for the coming financial year. Under the
final Bush plans this would have dropped, in today's dollars, to about
Dollars 250bn in 1997. Clinton administration plans would cut this to about
Dollars 230bn. It will be the least the US has spent on defence in real
terms since the slack years of the late 1970s. As a share of US gross
domestic product - about 3 per cent - it will be the lowest since the second
world war, and half what it was in the mid-1980s.
The Pentagon may be making some risky assumptions about what it can pay for
within that budget. About 40 per cent of the extra reductions foreseen under
the latest Clinton plan come from lower inflation expectations, calculated
at 2.5 per cent or less a year. Savings of about Dollars 18bn depend on
making the pay freeze stick, with subsequent below-inflation pay increases.
And the projections assume that plans carried over from the previous
administration are matched by sufficient funding.
The new team already reckoned that it had inherited a shortfall of Dollars
10bn over the 1994-97 period and would need to make that amount of extra
cuts, just to make the sums come out.
A panel of three outside experts, reporting back last month, found that the
previous tenants had been over-optimistic about efficiency savings and had
underestimated some other costs. The panel put the figure at up to Dollars
15bn. Mr Aspin, relieved that there was not a Dollars 100bn black hole as
some had predicted, chose to add another Dollars 5bn to his spending plans
from fiscal 1995, rather than order still more cuts.
In a trillion-dollar spending programme, such sums are a drop in the ocean.
But Mr Korb at Brookings believes the amount of underfunding is closer to
Dollars 25bn.
The experts' panel has also issued two sonorous warnings. One is that, in
the early part of the next century, the US will have trouble paying for all
the projects now in development. The other is that unit costs will rise.
Declining defence business 'is likely to lead to significant increases in
the overhead rates of defence suppliers'.
This, according to the report, 'could lead to unexpected and largely
unavoidable increases in existing programmes and elimination of a
significant percentage of the cost savings that would ordinarily result from
programme terminations'.
When Martin Marietta's Mr Augustine was working at the Pentagon in the 1960s
he had a theory about rising weapon costs. 'I predicted that in the year
2054 one tactical aircraft would cost the whole defence budget,' he says.
'And we're right on track.'
Defence manufacturers do not know yet how heavily the axe will fall, but
know that it will fall mostly in their part of the budget. The 'investment
account', covering procurement, research and development and construction,
and running for more than a decade at over Dollars 100bn a year, is expected
to suffer a disproportionate share of cuts.
This is despite the likelihood that at least two equipment items not
currently budgeted for will somehow be squeezed in: production of the
innovative V-22 tilt-rotor transport aircraft for the Marines, a
multi-billion-dollar project opposed by the last defence secretary, Mr Dick
Cheney, but supported by Mr Bill Clinton during his presidential campaign;
and maybe Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn for a third Seawolf submarine, just to
keep production going.
Something else will have to give way. In the past the long US budgetary
process has provided hope of resurrection for cancelled projects. But Dave
McCurdy, a leading Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, predicts:
'A lot of the programmes are going to stay dead.'
The US may also have to contemplate deeper cuts in the size of its forces,
already reduced from 2.17m in 1987 to 1.73m. The new administration has
indicated a target of 1.4m by 1997 instead of the 1.6m planned under
President George Bush. But it may go further still in cutting troop numbers,
rather than reduce forces' readiness. It would be easier to save money this
way - maintaining ammunition and keeping battalions staffed is costly - but
any step in that direction is taboo. Nobody wants to return to the 'hollow
forces' of the Carter era.
But, says Mr Augustine: 'We also have to be careful we don't build a hollow
industrial base.' By this he means a large number of defence factories,
producing at a low rate, doing little R&amp;D and incurring high overheads. 'I
think that's a very real risk,' he says.
The Pentagon's approach is to try to break down the barriers as much as
possible between military and civil industry. 'We cannot afford to have low
rates of production in an entirely different industrial sector,' says Mr
Deutch.
Its 'dual use' policy is meant to show wider economic benefits for the
effort that goes into military technology. It has two sides. One is to focus
on developing technologies that have commercial as well as military
applications. The other is to take advantage of advances in civil
technology, breaking down the tangle of regulations governing the military
procurement process and buying products directly from the civil sector. This
is expected to produce significant savings especially in electronics and
software. Inquirers already have a freephone number to call: 1-800-DUAL USE.
Lockheed's Mr Tellep is cautious. 'Dual use is a valid concept if not
carried too far. You can have dual-use integrated circuits, dual-use
computers, perhaps dual-use cockpit displays. It's hard to think of a
dual-use tank.'
But Mr Augustine can imagine the next generation of battle tank being
designed to use a truck engine instead of the current Abrams tank's gas
turbine. 'Even though it's not the optimum tank, it may be the optimum tank
you can produce.'
To keep vital defence plants in business, the Pentagon could transfer
maintenance work from state arsenals and dockyards to private-sector
manufacturers.
It will also count more on government-led foreign military sales, regardless
of arguments for restraint in regions such as the Middle East. A sharp
decline in sales from the former Soviet Union has given the US overwhelming
dominance in the world market, with arms transfer agreements worth almost
Dollars 29bn last year.
Exports are already covering production gaps. The country's sole remaining
tank production line, which General Dynamics operates at Lima, Ohio, now
lives off Egyptian, Saudi and Kuwaiti contracts. Foreign sales used to be
the icing on the cake for US arms companies. They have become a necessary
part of the industrial strategy.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Financing the welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE over UK welfare spending is taking place in a time-honoured
muddle of secret bilateral negotiation, leak and panic. A more reasoned
examination is needed to determine what the state should be doing for its
citizens in the 21st century, and how this can be financed.
Although prompted by the enfeebled condition of the public finances, this is
a debate that would be needed even if the fiscal position were healthy.
Demographic pressures mean that current spending commitments are
unsustainable in the medium term; meanwhile changing lifestyles and
individual tastes and aspirations make a separate case for a more varied
pattern of provision.
The starting point should be to revisit the principles behind the welfare
state, originally set up to protect those who, through poverty, illness,
unemployment or old age, could not help themselves. To achieve these aims,
it provided a cradle-to-grave social security system, a national health
service, low-rent housing and free state education. The universal provision
of health and social security reflected the circumstances of British
post-war society in which all but the wealthiest needed such support. The
solidarity of wartime experience also gave resonance to the idea of a
welfare state into which all contributed and out of which all drew.
That principle of social solidarity remains important. Any welfare system
must command the support of those who contribute to it as well as those who
most need its help. But economic growth has reduced the overlap between
these two groups. An increasing proportion of people can provide pensions,
health care, housing and education for themselves. There remains a large
minority who depend on the safety net of the welfare state. Yet
paradoxically, it is often the middle classes who get most out of the
welfare state, leaving too little for those who lack alternative means.
Today, universality is both unaffordable and undesirable.
Right balance
The question which must be asked in every decade is whether the balance
between collective and individual provision is right. A London School of
Economics study estimates that over 60 per cent of the taxes paid by the
average person is returned in various benefits (the rest goes in
redistribution). The welfare state acts as a savings bank, with people
paying in when times are good and drawing out in times of need. More of this
savings bank function could easily, with appropriate regulation, be
undertaken by the individual through private provision.
For some welfare services, however, efficiency may be best served by
maintaining a role for the state. In health, for example, international
experience suggests that some sort of state role is essential to bear down
on the overall bill and ensure cost-sharing between different groups. But
even in the health service it is clear that many people want and would be
prepared to pay for premium levels of service; this does not mean they wish
to see the NHS destroyed.
User charges
User charges also have a greater role to play in paying for public
expenditure which confers economic advantage on the recipients. The planned
expansion in higher education will need a greater contribution from
students, with fees being repaid through a graduate tax. Investment in roads
might be financed by higher petrol taxes paid by those using them. And
London First, the business consortium, has suggested that improvements in
London's transport infrastructure could be partly financed by a levy on
businesses in the capital.
Such moves involve a degree of hypothecation - of earmarking revenues for
particular purposes. A pamphlet published today by Demos, a new think-tank,
suggests much greater use of hypothecation to 'reconnect taxation', so that
voters can see where their taxes are going. It also advocates referendums to
allow voters to choose appropriate tax levels locally to pay for services
such as health or public transport.
There are dangers in such an approach, such as the loss of necessary
flexibility to switch funds between programmes and the tonic it might give
to special interest groups. Badly structured local referendums could also
encourage the wealthy to migrate to the low-tax suburbs, as in the US,
leaving a weakened tax base incapable of dealing with the problems of the
inner cities. But the Demos pamphlet provokes exactly the sort of
longer-term thinking which is missing from the current political debate.
Decisions made and unmade amid fiscal crises suggest to voters that the
entire issue of reforming the welfare state is itself a crisis. It is not.
An orderly modernisation of the welfare state is desirable as well as
necessary if people are to plan their lives around reasonable expectations
of what they must provide for themselves.

Sir, The improvement to the FT weather service is greatly welcomed.
Particularly useful are the forecast temperatures for the day of publication
in the leading centres of the world. Your previous service giving
temperatures at noon on the previous day was, after all, of interest to just
a few time travellers.
Perhaps the time is now right to extend this logic to your excellent London
Share Service. The previous day's figures are, after all, an esoteric
interest. The value of your newspaper would be immeasurably increased, for
the general reader, by the inclusion of forecast share prices at noon on the

No doubt, the actuaries you use for your share indices could easily cope
with such a short-term forecast.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Too high, too low, or just about right / Examining the
debate over profit levels earned by the UK's privatised utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are Britain's privatised utilities making excess profits?
The question, debated since BT was privatised in 1984, has been brought to a
head by the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of
British Gas. The probe was triggered mainly by the inability of the company
to agree with Ofgas, its regulator, what level of profits was reasonable.
A dispute over profits is also simmering between Ofwat and the water
industry. The water regulator has embarked on an elaborate examination of
profitability for a review next year of the industry's charges.
The government originally rejected profit controls when privatisations began
in 1984 and opted for price caps. The idea was that caps would encourage
efficiency as companies would be able to keep the extra profits from
cost-cutting. But it became apparent that price caps, reviewed every four or
five years, could not be set without reference to profits.
Defining a benchmark for a reasonable level of profits is far from easy.
Crude profit figures in themselves prove nothing, as large companies need
larger profits than small companies to reimburse greater shareholder
investment.
Profit increases by utilities also prove little. Last week the airports
group BAA, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, and three electricity
companies - PowerGen, National Grid and Scottish Hydro-Electric - reported
higher profits, but the figures still begged the question of whether levels
were too high, too low or about right.
The way regulators, utilities and the MMC answer this question is by
calculating the 'cost of capital' - defined as the minimum a company must
pay to raise funds from investors. If a company's return on assets is
consistently below its cost of capital, it will be unable to raise new
funds. If it is higher, customers are being charged more than necessary.
Applying this theory in practice runs into numerous complexities. Moreover,
the utilities and their regulators have produced widely divergent figures of
the cost of capital.
Part of the explanation for the differing figures lies in the utilities'
interest in proving their cost of capital is high: that way, they believe,
the regulators will allow them to make higher profits.
Similarly, regulators, as consumer champions, have an incentive to keep
prices as low as possible, although this is tempered by their duty to ensure
the utilities can finance themselves.
The dispute is fiercest in the gas industry, where Ofgas argues that the
cost of capital is 2 1/2 to 5 per cent after inflation, while British Gas
believes it should be 6.7 per cent for existing assets and 10.8 per cent for
new investment. 'We are not earning enough. One of the reasons we went to
the MMC was because our profits were being squeezed,' says Mr Philip
Rogerson, British Gas's finance director.
In the water industry, the discrepancy is also wide, with Ofwat arguing for
a figure of 5 to 6 per cent and companies pushing for 9 1/2 per cent. 'The
water companies need to be profitable to invest to meet new environmental
standards,' says Mr Paul Garrett of the Water Services Association, the
industry trade body.
Observers not directly involved with either the utilities or their
regulators tend to argue that the right figure for the cost of capital lies
somewhere between the extremes. Mr Nigel Burton, an analyst at Warburg
Securities, says, on average, it is something below 8 per cent. Mr Simon
Taylor, an economist at J P Morgan, the investment bank, thinks the
appropriate figure is 6 to 7 per cent for National Grid and higher for
others.
Most regulators and utilities use the same academic model to calculate the
cost of capital, called the capital asset pricing model. This takes the
interest rate on a low-risk asset, such as index-linked gilts, and adds a
premium to compensate for the greater riskiness of buying equities. An
adjustment is then made to account for the fact that companies raise funds
not just through issuing equity but also debt, which is cheaper.
The problem is that there is disagreement on all elements of the
calculation: if different figures are put into the model, different figures
emerge.
There is particular controversy over whether investments in utilities are
risky. The regulators argue that they are less risky than investments in
other businesses. The products they supply are basic necessities, not
short-term fads, and their dominant market positions give them protection
from competition. But the utilities say their businesses are high risk
because of continual interference by regulators.
Even once a figure is decided for the cost of capital, there is still a
question of how to value utilities' assets. This is because regulators wish
to compare the cost of capital with profits as a percentage of company
assets.
But valuing assets leads to another conundrum. Inflation rules out valuing
assets according to how much was actually paid for them - the 'historic
cost' approach. But valuing them according to how much they would cost to
replace - the 'current cost' approach - can produce absurdly high figures.
The most extreme case is the water industry, which was sold to investors for
Pounds 5.2bn but whose assets in current costs are valued at more than
Pounds 100bn. If a 5 per cent cost of capital was applied, profits would
need to be increased five-fold (see chart).
Ofwat and Ofgas have chosen to cut through this Gordian knot by
differentiating between pre- and post-privatisation assets.
Pre-privatisation assets are valued according to how much the shareholders
paid at flotation, while post-privatisation assets are valued on a current
cost basis.
But this is of little use to shareholders and customers, since published
accounts do not disentangle pre- and post-privatisation assets. Matters are
more difficult with BT, which stopped publishing accounts on a current cost
basis when privatised.
Moreover, figures for single years can be misleading. British Gas's 3.1 per
cent return in 1992 was depressed by exceptional factors. Mr Rogerson of
British Gas explains that in most years since privatisation the company has
earned between 6 and 7 per cent.
Such complexities lead some to question the the formal approach of
calculating the cost of capital. Mr Peter Hyde, an analyst at Kleinwort
Benson Securities, says it involves 'taking one subjective figure, called
capital values, and multiplying it with another subjective figure, called
rate of return, to calculate an even more subjective figure'.
A less formal method is to look at how well shareholders have fared in
practice. This approach, which involves comparing how far share prices have
risen since privatisation with the rise in the FTSE 100 index, is set out in
the chart.
In all cases, the privatised utilities have outperformed the index, but
their records vary considerably. The recently privatised water and
electricity companies have done very well - with share prices often rising
by 100 per cent during periods when the index rose little. BT and British
Gas have also seen their share prices rise. But the rises look less
impressive given that they were privatised in 1984 and 1986 respectively and
the index has also risen substantially since.
The main explanation for the varied performance is that regulators have
already tightened the price caps of the companies which were privatised
first. BT's cap has been squeezed from the rate of inflation minus 3
percentage points (RPI-3) to RPI-7 1/2 , and British Gas's from RPI-2 to
RPI-5. The tighter caps are already having an impact on profits.
By contrast, the more recently privatised electricity and water industries
have so far escaped stricter regulation. But reviews of their price caps are
under way and it is unlikely they can avoid the regulatory squeeze forever.
When the British regulatory structure was invented, the government hoped to
avoid the American debate about the proper rate of return for utilities. It
was over-optimistic. The debate is now well under way. It is complex and
fraught. It will probably never end.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Call for a royal commission on manufacturing
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Zeneca's current difficulties with its share issue ('Dealers concerned
at Zeneca outlook', June 11) is just the latest example of the chronic
short-termism that plagues British industry.
Here is a company at the leading edge of scientific innovation, in an
industry which requires long-term investment in R&amp;D, but which also produces
long-term rewards, struggling to find the capital it needs. Contrast this
with the recent stock market feeding frenzy in property where investors have
been fighting to get a piece of the action.
How much longer are we going to have to put up with our future as an
industrial nation being undermined by the operation of a completely
inadequate financial system? How much longer are we going to see the share
of Britain's gross domestic product produced by manufacturing continue to
decline? While some sectors of our manufacturing are rightly admired,
overall it is now simply too small.
This is a long-term problem that requires long-term solutions and a change
in attitudes. The emerging consensus on the importance of manufacturing now
needs to be turned into practical action to support and sustain our
industries. It is for this reason that MSF has recently proposed to the
prime minister the establishment of a royal commission on manufacturing
industry. Its task would be to investigate and report on the role that
government can and should play in supporting manufacturing industry; lessons
to be learned from abroad; structural changes needed to overcome the
dominance of short-term thinking in the link between finance and productive
industrial investment; establishment of an industrial system based on
partnership between management and employees; and the most effective means
of turning innovation, research and development into manufactured goods.
There has been a large number of royal commissions this century, but not one
on manufacturing - the foundation of Britain's national wealth. It is time
this was remedied.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You may be right, overall, to urge the limiting of directors' rolling
contracts to not more than 12 months ('Pay off punch', June 8), but the
longer ones do have their legitimate uses.
I recently pointed an accusing finger at a non-executive company chairman
who had raised from three to five years the contracts for this top two
executive directors. He patiently explained that he was anxious to retain
the services of the two executives concerned for as long as possible as they
were important to the company. There was no question, in this case, of a
possible golden parachute.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Rio finds a hero: A colourful mayor has brought hope to the
city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who does much business in third world cities can empathise with the
British investment banker who recently hurled his telephone out of the
window of his hotel on Copacabana beach after a tenth failed attempt to make
a local call.
For residents of Rio de Janeiro, the ailing telephone system, while probably
a minor problem, provides a fitting symbol for a city where everything is
stretched beyond its limits.
The transport system is chaotic; sprawling slums deface hillsides; the bay
is polluted almost beyond redemption; and chronic unemployment has pushed
many into drugs and prostitution. Crime is so rampant that US State
Department travel advisories tell tourists not to walk in the streets.
Just as many of Rio's 10m population were giving up hope, a civic leader has
emerged, pledging to change all this. Since becoming mayor in January, Mr
Cesar Maia, a left-wing economist from the Democratic Movement party (PMDB),
has propelled Rio into national headlines. He has introduced the city's own
time zone, and half-jokingly has threatened to issue its own currency to
replace the inflation-racked cruzeiro. He closed off the main commercial
thoroughfare for a week of open-air concerts by the Moscow Philharmonic and
dressed up as a purple Ninja turtle to encourage children to have
vaccinations.
Mr Maia believes such stunts are necessary to boost the city's
self-confidence and give it a new image. 'I want to show that Rio is
different from other Latin American cities - it's playful and rebellious.'
Behind all the promotion, however, Mr Maia is serious. His ultimate aim is
to make Rio a 'global city' modelled on Madrid and Barcelona, offering a
range of facilities to attract business and tourists.
Initially he wants to bring in foreign and domestic investment to improve
the city's infrastructure, and to privatise public services where possible,
to leave the administration free to concentrate on 'the big picture'. By
cracking down on crime and boosting its cultural offerings, he plans to
capitalise on the city's spectacular beauty to make the city an
international business centre.
To accomplish this, Mr Maia has assembled an internationally respected team
of advisers, including Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques, a former federal economy
minister, who is in charge of attracting foreign capital and aid; and Mr
Eduardo Modiano, former head of Brazil's privatisation programme. His brief
is to put roads, the marina and even the city's renowned carnival into
private hands.
The mayor and his team face a staggering challenge. Urban planners reckon
that Rio's population is three times greater than its housing,
infrastructure and employment base can support. More than 1,500 slums and
irregular settlements house a third of its residents.
Evidence of the lack of investment in Rio's infrastructure is abundant. Huge
pot-holes in the streets contribute to frequent traffic accidents. Giant
pits stand as grim reminders that the city went bankrupt in the late 1980s
halfway through building a metro system.
Rio's decline can be traced to 1960 when Brasilia became the capital of
Brazil. Since then its traditional shipbuilding industry has collapsed and
its importance as a port dwindled. As unemployment rose, crime surged.
Businesses moved to Sao Paulo, and tourism slumped. Unemployment and crime
in turn rose still higher. The syndrome has intensified since the national
economy fell into recession in 1989.
It was the issue of law and order that carried Mr Maia to power. When the
Earth Summit took place in Rio last June he was lagging in the polls. But
the tight security surrounding the conference showed local people how
pleasant Rio could be if crime was contained. Afterwards, Mr Maia's ratings
rocketed when he said he would use the army if necessary to make Rio safe.
To help stem the fall in tourism, which has dropped 70 per cent since 1989,
he has created a special force of undercover 'tourist' police. Dressed in
T-shirts and Bermuda shorts, its members travel in beach buggies and on
jet-skis.
Mr Philip Carruthers, head of the Rio hotel association, says results are
already being seen in terms of fewer tourist muggings. Encouraged by the new
anti-crime mood, a Rio judge has imprisoned 14 of the city's main crime
bosses, who are under investigation for alleged involvement in arms and drug
trafficking. The state prosecutor is investigating 15 senior policemen for
'illicit enrichment'.
To improve business facilities, Mr Maia has secured the city's first
important investment commitment in decades. Embratel, the state
telecommunications company, has selected Rio as the site for Latin America's
first Teleport - a sophisticated communications centre which will update the
city's telephone system as well as offer office space equipped with
satellite technology. Embratel is currently looking for private investors
and multilateral loans to help finance the Dollars 1bn project.
But Mr Maia's main focus is on culture. 'I see culture as part of economic
policy,' the mayor says. 'To make Rio work, we need to make it a special
place to visit. Top executives do not go to New York just for business -
they go to enjoy its cultural offerings.'
Arguing that the city's natural beauty is an economic asset which must be
protected, Mr Maia has sent in bulldozers to 'remove' slum dwellings from
richer areas. Such actions, while applauded by business men and hoteliers,
leave him open to charges from representatives of the slum-dwellers that he
is 'governing for the rich'. The mayor counters that his administration is
the first to have provided regular public services such as rubbish
collection in slum areas.
The collapse this month of a hillside slum in heavy rain and the gunpoint
robbery of a visiting American pop group at the airport show how far Rio has
to go before it again merits the title 'Marvellous City'. Rio has not yet
decided whether its new mayor is a prankster or a genius. But there is a new
mood of optimism which could be the first step to recovery.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Serb leader fails to offer alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JACK STEWART-CLARK MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, writes (Personal View,
June 9) about the Moslems in Bosnia. He asserts that no Serb can deny that
they need a secure home in Bosnia. Is it not strange, therefore, that the
Bosnian Serbs, with their self-styled Serbian parliament, refused to allow
Mr Karadzic to put his signature to the Vance-Owen plan, which allowed for
the Moslems to have just such a secure home?
At no time have the Bosnian Serbs come forward with a just alternative. The
truth of the matter is that Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Seselj, who have
between them almost total power in Serbia, are intent on carving out a
greater Serbia and the Bosnian Serb regime under Karadzic is a willing
accomplice to this. A greater Serbia in their eyes includes all of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the occupied portions of Croatia, Kosovo and Macedonia.
Possibly the Moslems may be allowed living space within this but only under
the boot of Serb domination.
Karadzic describes the Bosnian Moslems as 'our Slav brothers'. Let him and
the Serb leadership come forward with a humane and realistic plan for these
brothers, which will enable them to live in peace and freedom. The world may
then start believing that his words have some substance and are not another
smoke screen behind which further ethnic conquests may be made.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Aims of Taiwanese airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK HSU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I offer some clarification to your article speculating on the possible
advancement of government negotiations for the development of commercial air
services between Taiwan and mainland China ('Business pulls Taiwan closer to
mainland', May 21).
Your naming of certain cities as possible destinations for new air routes
from Taiwan - Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou - is conjecture, and
will remain so until such time that the political situation changes.
That EVA Air may serve these, or any other cities in mainland China, must
therefore be seen as speculative, and our decision would be made solely on
commercial grounds.
It is quite wrong, however, to suggest that EVA Air would transfer aircraft
from existing international scheduled services to develop new air services
between Taiwan and mainland China. Our international route development
remains central to our growth strategy.
It is untrue also to state the EVA Air's chairman, Mr Y F Yang, is 'an
avowed supporter' of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive party. He has never
been affiliated with any of our political parties.
Finally, your article began by stating that EVA Air will have five new
Boeing 747-400 aircraft before the end of this year. In fact, we shall have
seven.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Sanctuary kept at arm's length - Aldeburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The month of June increasingly looks like Benjamin Britten month. Riding on
the coat-tails of the Aldeburgh Festival, the record companies tend to save
up any Britten and this year promise to excel themselves: the first ever
recording of Gloriana, brand new sets of Peter Grimes and A Midsummer
Night's Dream, and a re-issue of Owen Wingrave are all on the point of
reaching the shops.
Since Britten's death the guardians of the Aldeburgh Festival have kept its
focus on new music, looking forwards rather than looking back. Any danger of
the festival turning into merely a sanctuary for Britten's music has been
kept at arm's length, but when one of his works threatens to become an
extinct species, there is every reason to revive it. The last-named of the
operas above, Owen Wingrave, is rarely seen. On Friday it formed the opening
night of this year's festival.
Ideally, the opera would have been staged. (One fully staged production a
year, besides any other considerations, would give audiences a stronger
incentive to make the journey out to the East Anglia fens.) Owen Wingrave,
though written specifically as a television opera, comes across surprisingly
well in the theatre, as we know from the 1973 Royal Opera production. But,
for whatever reason, it was only given a concert performance here.
                          *      *      *
Like the original television film (recently repeated by the BBC), this opera
is in black-and-white. There is none of the ambivalence between good and
evil so cleverly exploited by Britten in his best works, only a
confrontation between what is right (the young, pacifist Owen) and wrong
(his crusty, aristocratic, military family).
Where the stage production gained was in the music's powerful evocation of
atmosphere, the suffocatingly musty air of the Wingrave family seat. Britten
was an experienced writer for the stage by this time and knew how to compose
a mood right through an opera by basing all the music on a small number of
recognisable intervals and harmonies.
That was lost in this concert performance. So, more crucially, was a lot of
the text. The London Sinfonietta, playing from the stage, was too dominant a
presence; the resonant acoustic of the Maltings did the rest. I doubt that
there was much the conductor, Oliver Knussen, could have done, but it was
only in the later, less heavily-scored scenes that the opera began to exert
a dramatic grip.
In the title-role David Wilson-Johnson made Owen a less blameless spokesman
for peace than usual by introducing a touch of irresponsibility and wilful
rebellion. It was good to see John Shirley-Quirk as Coyle, the only survivor
here from the original cast. Otherwise the singers made an impression
according to how many of the words they could get across, John Graham-Hall
as Lechmere and Mary King as Kate being the most successful.
Even now there are Britten premieres that the festival is managing to dig
out. After Owen Wingrave the audience could drive to Aldeburgh Parish Church
for a late-night recital featuring the Haffner Wind Ensemble directed by
Nicholas Daniel in two movements of a youthful Britten Wind Sextet - lively
music, with a fine ear for sound and echoes of various other composers'
styles. The enigmatic second movement did not make it clear whether Britten
regarded the piece as finished.
On Saturday the main event was a piano recital by Peter Serkin at the
Maltings. This was a classic Aldeburgh event. The programme preceded Bach's
Goldberg Variations with a sequence of short works which the pianist has
commissioned from leading contemporary composers.
A time-limit of six minutes seems to have been set, but some participants -
like Knussen in his Variations, Op. 24 and Alexander Goehr with ' ..in real
time 1' - subdivided their allotted time into even smaller units. Both
pieces were inventive, vividly-characterised; the Goehr looked a beast to
play.

In his Rain Tree Sketch and its successor, Rain Tree Sketch II, Toru
Takemitsu preferred short mood-paintings, near-Impressionist in their
sensitivity and delicacy, a surface of flickering activity over a deep
underlying calm.
Takemitsu is the festival's featured composer this year and the programme of
his music includes three film events. The festival ends on 27 June with a
repeat performance of Owen Wingrave.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Decisions based on hard data - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One reason why arts sponsorship has been slow to develop from a chairman's
perk to a vital component in a company's strategic marketing programme is
the lack of research into its effectiveness. This is not surprising. It can
cost more to assess scientifically the impact of sponsorship on an arts
event than the funding of the event itself.
This is changing. Sponsorship is moving inexorably under the control of
marketing directors who tend to make spending decisions on the basis of hard
data. So when Clerical Medical, the insurance company, considered increasing
its commitment to arts sponsorship, it thought it essential first to invest
in research.
A Pounds 15,000 survey into the composition of the audience for the arts,
and its views on arts sponsorship, has not come up with anything sensational
but its very existence has been enough to sway the board. This year Clerical
Medical spent under Pounds 100,000 on arts sponsorship, mainly on music at
the Bath Festival. In the future, while its competitors concentrate on
sport, it plans to reach its potential customers by investing more heavily
in the arts.
The research, which is based on responses from over 8,000 individuals,
confirms that the audience for the arts is just what a company wants -
affluent, middle aged, and committed. Arts lovers prefer music and the
theatre way above other arts forms and see little wrong with sponsorship.
They think sponsors should concentrate on trying to bring seat prices down,
and their main complaint is that sponsors grab the best seats.
In the main the research is positive. The findings would perhaps deter
companies from supporting the experimental and the avant-garde, but suggest
that the Royal Opera House is on the right lines in its attempt to get
prospective sponsors to help by subsidising seat prices rather than new
productions.
ABSA played its part in producing the research and will supply copies of the
findings for Pounds 150 to its members and Pounds 75 for arts organisations.
The Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, under which Pounds 4.5m. of
Government money is available this year to match new, and existing,
sponsorships by companies, has gone international. British Council offices
in 98 countries can now apply for grants, up to a collective limit of Pounds
250,000.
The first beneficiary was the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Its visit to Thailand
was sponsored by Jaguar to the value of Pounds 15,000 and the Bangkok office
of the British Council secured an additional Pounds 3,750 for the trip
through the BSIS scheme. As an established sponsor Jaguar only qualified for
a 1:4 bonus.
The British Council is selling hard to business the commercial spin-offs
that can follow from sponsoring British arts companies on overseas trips,
especially the opportunities to meet key foreign politicians. Its enterprise
is paying off. Last year it brought in Pounds 6.8m. in sponsorship, beating
its target by Pounds 1m . And most of this sum, Pounds 4.9m. in fact,
fostered arts events rather than exchanges and training.
In the current economic climate it is getting harder to persuade business to
invest in the arts and there are numerous arts companies, including the RSC,
the CBSO, and the National Theatre, still seeking sponsors for projected
overseas tours this year. But the Council has raised its target for 1993-94
and has high hopes of a major splash in Los Angeles in late 1994.
Glaxo has put up Pounds 36,000 for a three-year programme to give the
children of Ealing, where it is a major employer, their first taste of
opera. Pavilion Opera performed Donizetti's L'Elisir d'amore in four schools
during May, and 1500 children were involved in linked projects and as an
enraptured audience.
The recently established Pavilion Opera Educational Trust (POET) is now
talking to the mayors of Westminster and Tower Hamlets in the expectation of
finding local companies who will support performances in these boroughs in
future years. POET chairman Geoffrey Simmonds is seeking Pounds 75,000 a
year which will finance twelve school performances by the chamber opera
troupe.
Vanity Fair, the magazine, is spending the little money it has this year for
promotion on helping the arts in an unconventional way: by underwriting
parties. On Thursday 250 friends of the Serpentine Gallery gathered, with
the Princess of Wales, for a gala dinner designed to raise around Pounds
50,000 towards the Serpentine's Pounds 1.5m. rebuilding appeal. The party
went all the better thanks to a Pounds 30,000 contribution from Vanity Fair.
Earlier this year Vanity Fair paid for the launch party for the movie
Damage. It feels that the participants at these glitzy charity events are
its type of reader. It also helps that the Serpentine is enhancing the gala
with a three-day show of works by artists who have enjoyed exhibitions in
its bucolic setting over the decades, artists like Hockney, Moore, Rego,
Hitchens, and others.
As usual the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT), which opened
yesterday, has been well backed by sponsors. The key new sponsor is BT
which, in its desire to get involved with community projects, is supporting
two local carnivals, one based around Vietnamese newcomers to Greenwich, the
other a Trinidadian masquerade in Spitalfields. In addition it is backing
LIFT's first major educational programme in which overseas artists train
London school children in their skills.
Cable &amp; Wireless, Enterprise Oil, Routledge, and British Gas are also
involved, and Cameron Mackintosh is financing a visit by the Hanoi Water
Puppets, the first Vietnamese arts group to tour the UK, in recognition of
the Vietnamese contribution to his hit musical, Miss Saigon.
There may be no Glyndebourne Festival in Sussex this year (the theatre is
being totally rebuilt) but the nine concerts arranged by Glyndebourne with
the LPO on London's South Bank this summer are virtually sold out, and the
first, a concert performance of Beatrice et Benedict on June 21st, is to be
sponsored by the Banque Nationale de Paris.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Chernikov's vision that defied Stalin - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iakov Chernikhov (1889-1951) was known as the Soviet Piranesi because of his
visionary skills as an artist and draughtsman. His work was, until recently,
relatively unknown despite the fact that he is clearly an important
influence on contemporary architecture and design. He was one of the leaders
of the Russian avant-garde - an architect, engineer, theorist and artist,
who was forced by the mad dictates of Stalinism to lead an unfulfilled life.
The grandson of this great pioneer, Andrei Chernikhov, has established a
foundation to promote interest in his grandfather's work and to encourage
architectural experiments among the young. It is this foundation, with the
International Academy of Architecture, that has organised the remarkable
exhibition that has been seen in the US and is now showing in London until
July 20 at The Architecture Foundation in Bury Street, London, SW1. (in The
Economist Buildiing).
This is one of the best architectural exhibitions to be seen anywhere at the
moment. It shows the intense vision of one man at one period of time - the
1920s and 1930s. Since the collapse of communism, it has become clear that
there is endless work for architectural historians to do in eastern Europe -
reassessing the roots of modernism is merely one task that has to be done.
But the Chernikhov exhibition can be appreciated on its own terms as the
work of an intensely talented and technically skilled architect who was a
major part of that group in Russia that really were the advance guard of
modernism.
The exhibition is called 'Architecture of Fantasy.' The title is in some
ways misleading. Although Chernikhov, along with many other talented
architects and artists was unable to practice during the Stalinist regime,
he cannot have seen his work as merely fantasy. His drawings are
philosophical statements about structure, geometry and machines that could
have been built.
He was born in 1889 in Pavlovgrad in the Ukraine, and initially he studied
painting at the Odessa College of Art and later the Academy of Arts in
Leningrad. There are some highly respectable 'old Master' drawings from that
period of his life in the exhibition. He moved on to the study of
architecture in 1916 and, because he had to earn his living while studying
(not to mention the disruptive effects of the Russian Revolution), he did
not graduate until 1925.
His early professional life was devoted to teaching and writing. He founded
the Research and Experimental Laboratory of Architectural Forms and Methods
and Graphic Art in Leningrad in 1928 where he was to teach both drawing from
nature and abstract composition. His 'fantasies' were a part of his system
of teaching, showing the infinite possibilities of geometry and the skilled
use of drawing instruments. He also developed, as we can see from the
exhibition, a marvellous colour sense. The exhibition includes photographs
of the classes at the school with rows of pupils drawing away under the
manic gaze of Chernikhov.
His work exemplifies the innovative approach to architecture of the
Constructivists of the 1920s, but because Chernikhov was so well versed in
engineering and perspective his architecture is more expressive than the
work of his contemporaries. It is not possible in the London show to compare
his work to Melnikov and Leonidov - as it was in the Paris/Moscow exhibition
that I recall at the PompidouCentre in 1979. They were both more original
form makers, and had more variety in their work.
What is fascinating to witness is the sense of power behind these drawings.
They do represent a movement and in Soviet Russia in the 1920's the new
architecture was powerful enough to convince serious classical architects to
join the experiment and produce work that bridged the frontiers between
classicism and modernism. It would be interesting to see an exhibition of
the work of architects like Zholtovsky and Fomin who were geniuses at
bringing all the forces of history to their work.
There is one particularly moving exhibit that architects here might read
with profit - especially those members of the RIBA who complain of
government interference in the profession. In 1935 Chernikhov's books were
banned from state libraries and his teaching was curtailed. He wrote a
moving letter to Joseph Stalin begging for an end to his intellectual exile.
Needless to say Chernikhov never received an answer. He attempted in some of
his work to adjust to the megalomania of Stalin's architectural taste. His
extremely monumental designs inspired by the official desire for memorials
to the Second World War are literally amazing. Even more disturbing are his
drawings for the 'Palaces of Communism' series that portray with uncanny
prescience the giant prisons of Stalin's long tyranny. These are poignant
and powerful works that show the intensity of his visual imagination.
What is shown at the Architecture Foundation is only a fragment of his
output. He left behind some 780 drawings and 50 books, and he clearly
deserves a thorough biography and scholarly analysis of his important work.
This display is an important glimpse into a world of architectural creation
that most of us had almost forgotten.

gas nitric oxide plays a vital role in the working of the human body. Damage
to production of the gas is connected with conditions such as epilepsy,
hypertension, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Rob Buckman, one half of the
much mourned cabaret duo Beatles and Buckman presents the first in a series
of four programmes taking a critical look at the state of conventional
medicine: Magic Or Medicine? (9.00 C4). Panorama reports from Aldermaston on

FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Dylan in one of his more bullish moods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you're Irish a Fleadh is a party; if you're not Irish (perhaps even if
you are) it is falling flat on your face in a muddy field, making contact
with a rich undergrowth of detritus, and trying to avoid the rain while
waiting for some warmth, some raising of the spirits, by musicians from over
30 predominantly Irish bands.
Good things have been spoken of this annual hooley in north London, but
Saturday's event was only fitfully enjoyable. An English summer was at its
bleakest and Finsbury Park lacks natural grandeur. Even an appearance by
that well-known Irishman, Bob O'Dylan, failed to ignite the 20,000-odd
rather forlorn spectators.
Dylan was in one of his more bullish moods. He tried. And though not by
nature an Irishman you could somehow recall hearing his voice, that
confident cranking of a musical saw, replicated by some lone Paddy in the
bar of a Camden Town pub on a Saturday night. On my last viewing of perhaps
the most creative pop artist ever he was invisible, skulking in the shadows
of a stage and content with a perverse mockery of his talent. On Saturday he
was up front, blowing his harp with enthusiasm and duelling with his
guitarist in extrovert, imaginatively embroidered versions of 'All Along the
Watchtower' and 'Memphis Blues Again'.
The slower songs were less successful, enabling the man to take refuge in
his legend, but Dylan still sounds miraculously contemporary. He can find
relevance and rhythms in his music with the right aura to make a damp
depressing evening an occasion.
The Fleadh is a wonderful reminder of the Irish contribution to popular
music. Before Dylan on the main stage we had Irish high spirits, with
Hothouse Flowers, and Irish melancholy, with Van Morrison. Hothouse Flowers
lifted the crowd and got the arms waving. They may lack the character and
originality to become mega but as a snapshot for the 21st century of what a
mainstream pop band used to be like on stage they could hardly be bettered.
Morrison just goes on and on, his jangly, jig-like band acting as the ideal
counter point to his resonant, lived in, voice. He was in restrained,
spiritual mood, with songs like 'The Garden' rather than the old belters. He
came across as a genuine echo of an Irishman far from home.

BOVIS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT (BPM) is providing construction management and
design expertise on the building of BAA's new 400,000 sq ft Terminal 1
airside development at Heathrow.
BPM, a division of the P&amp;0 company Bovis Construction, and architects
Richard Rogers Partnership have been brought together for the first time in
this way to create the facility which is due for a phased completion by
December 1995.
There are three different aspects to the project. A new Pounds 20m
purpose-built flight connections centre aims to attract transfer passengers
by offering tailor-made services under one roof.
An enlarged international departure lounge at Terminal 1 will enable
passengers to take advantage of catering areas and 56,000 sq ft of retail
space. The lounge will have seating accommodation for 1,400 and first class
and business class airline lounges.
The third improvement involves the replacement of the baggage handling
system with fully automated equipment which will include facilities for the
handling and storage of transfer baggage. This will allow smooth handover
from one airline to another and one terminal to another.

Blackpool, Lancashire.
Working for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Watson will supply and erect a total
of 2,000 tonnes of structural steel. Also to be installed under the contract
is a further 250 tonnes of tubular steel running track.
Fabrication will take place at Watson's Bolton factory during the summer
months, with erection scheduled for a 10-week period commencing at the
beginning of November, during BPB's close season. The steel work is to be
erected on foundations completed at the beginning of the year by Shepherd
Construction.
At its highest point, the rollercoaster will stand 235ft high, 65ft taller
than London's Nelson's column.
From here, the drop has an angle of 65 degrees, which will allow cars to
reach speeds of 85mph. The rollercoaster will run around BPB's 42-acre
promenade site for just over a mile, and will be above all the existing
rides.

FT  14 JUN 93 / People: Hurd adviser crosses fence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The discreet world of the political lobbyists has recruited a fresh
disciple. Edward Bickham, one of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's most
trusted advisers, has decided to cross the parliamentary divide and join
Hill and Knowlton, one of the top three public affairs consultancies.
Bickham, 36, replaces Tom McNally, the former Labour MP and adviser to Jim
Callaghan, who left in April to head the lobbying arm of Shandwick. Bickham
joins early next month as managing director, public affairs and corporate
policy.
Although Bickham's title suggests his brief will be somewhat wider than an
old political hand like McNally, his arrival at Hill and Knowlton completes
a series of high-profile changes at the top of an industry where success
often depends on getting a client's ideas heard in the right places. At the
end of 1992, Des Wilson, former campaign manager of the Liberal Democrats,
joined Burston-Marsteller, the other big player.
It has long been rumoured that Hurd plans to quit politics before the next
election. But Bickham, who has not ruled out standing for Parliament at some
stage, stresses that his decision to leave Hurd's side does not mean his old
boss will also head for the private sector shortly. Having been special
adviser to the Home Secretary and in Northern Ireland, Bickham had never
intended a second stint in Whitehall when he left to join British Satellite
Broadcasting in 1988. But he was called back into service by Hurd at the
time of the Gulf War and has acquired a reputation as one of the most
effective of the current crop of parliamentary advisers.
Bickham differs from Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former press
secretary who is also on the Hill and Knowlton payroll, in that he is not an
old-style political fixer. Instead he believes in knowing his way around the
ever-changing regulatory undergrowth. Companies need to 'anticipate trends
in regulation when developing business plans rather than reacting late in
the day in an atmosphere of crisis.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / People: IBJ's capital markets emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Toshiki Tobe has been appointed chief executive of IBJ International, the
London capital markets operation of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's
largest long-term credit bank.
He replaces Yoshio Osawa, who is returning to Tokyo this month to take up a
position as general manager of the securities business. He will be appointed
to the board at next month's annual general meeting.
Tobe has been based in London for 18 months, as managing director in charge
of capital market operations. IBJ has a policy of creating an overlap
between a current chief executive and his successor, unlike many Japanese
institutions.
Tobe says the firm plans to strengthen its presence in the capital markets,
including the derivatives side of the business. For example, IBJ will soon
put traders on the floor of the London International Financial Futures &amp;
Options Exchange (Liffe.)
IBJ International has a staff of 300 in London, and is one of the most
active Japanese financial institutions in the international capital markets.
According to IFR Securities Data, which tracks bond financings, IBJ ranks
21st in the Eurobond league table, after Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko, but ahead
of any other Japanese bank subsidiaries. The firm is not active in the
equities business, from which the parent is excluded under Japanese law. IBJ
also has a branch in London through which its corporate lending business is
channelled.

company says that now it has completed its restructuring phase his job is
over.
Phipps had been appointed as a representative of Gartmore when the then
chairman and chief executive, John Fletcher, was forced out by a group of
institutional investors in May 1991. Gartmore has since disposed of its
shareholding.
Hans Reischl, chief executive of German supermarket chain Rewe, which has
taken a minority stake in Budgens, recently went on to the board in a
non-executive capacity.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Westhead, chief executive of Bowthorpe, has rejoined the board of
Southern Water as a non-executive director after an absence of fifteen
months.
The board of Bowthorpe had suggested, when Westhead was promoted from group
managing director to chief executive at the beginning of 1992, that he
should relinquish other commitments. Now that he has settled into that role,
however, his fellow directors felt that the Southern position would bring
'useful cross-fertilisation', said Martyn Webster, group managing director
of Southern.
'I was upset when he first had to go. He is a very good non-executive
director at the sharp end of British industry who commands quite a high
reputation in the City.'
Non-executive director Sir David Nicolson, having turned 70, stepped down
from the Southern board in March.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: The right attitude - Staff surveys are
increasingly popular, but can be fraught with pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Mail's 180,000 employees now know officially that they are a pretty
miserable bunch. According to an internal employee attitude survey fed back
to them this month, a record 70 per cent of them are unhappy at work.
Uncertainty over privatisation, reorganisation of the service, new
technology and worries over job security - not to mention a 1.5 per cent
ceiling on public sector pay this year - all contribute to rock-bottom
morale.
Managers at Royal Mail, in common with those at British Telecom, which has
had similar upheavals and similar employee attitude survey results, profess
not to be surprised by the findings. At the same time, there is within both
organisations a profound level of scepticism among staff about whether the
results of the surveys will lead to any changes: questionnaire answers show
that at BT only 16 per cent of staff were able to think of any improvements
resulting from the previous year's survey; at Royal Mail, around half
thought management would not act on the findings.
But in spite of this widespread scepticism and the predictability, in many
cases, of results, the employee attitude survey industry has never been
healthier. The BBC is one of the most recent additions to swell the ranks of
those organisations now sending out employee attitude questionnaires. Other
companies include IBM, Abbey National, Digital Equipment and Hoechst UK. A
flourishing band of consultants and survey companies has grown up to service
this fashionable growth area.
While companies such as IBM, where staff surveys have been conducted since
1963, make conscientious attempts to translate findings into action, other
organisations may be wasting money on research - perhaps Pounds 20,000 a
shot for a modest project in a medium-sized organisation - that merely
raises expectations and is then shelved.
'Let's do an employee attitude survey' appears to be a reflex response by
companies to a range of perceived problems, according to Bill Quirke, a
consultant with London-based Synopsis Communication.
The first mistake companies make is to become immersed in technical matters
such as questionnaire design, without being clear what the survey is for and
what will be done with the results.
Typically, the decision to carry out an employee attitude survey will spring
from a fundamental disagreement at board level about what is going on inside
the company, he says: 'One director will say that people are unhappy and are
complaining - they don't understand the mission, they don't understand the
restructuring. Another will say it's not that bad. What he really means is
'to hell with whether they're happy or not, we're in a recession' '.
At that point the decision is made to bring in a third party to establish
the facts by conducting a survey. And so the process begins, based,
essentially, on the kind of debate that is never going to get anywhere - how
far companies should be 'nice' to their employees.
The idea of worker happiness comes from an outdated, hierarchical view of
work, claims Quirke. 'People at the top tell people at the bottom to go and
do the job, and then you check every now and then whether the natives are
restless,' he says. Indeed, employees may be fat and happy while their
company is failing to adapt to new markets, processes or customer
requirements, he adds.
Companies need a more hard-headed approach to what they are trying to find
out, and why, he says. 'People need to know where the organisation is going,
they need to understand their local objectives and how they fit in, and they
need to get regular feedback. Those are the things that should be tested.'
Quality programmes, in particular, mean that the common existing model of
communication - the person at the top shouts through a megaphone to the
person at the bottom - is no longer appropriate.
The next commonly made mistake is to become obsessed with scores and
comparisons with other companies, rather than looking at what the results
mean and how far they fit in with the business needs of the organisation.
Much of the time, admits Quirke, it is possible for a consultant to
construct a report on the findings before carrying out the research and
without knowing anything about the client's industry.
The Norm Report, as he calls it, would reach the following conclusions on
communications, for example: most people prefer to hear things through their
immediate boss; people are most interested in information about their own
immediate work unit; managers want more information but, at the same time,
complain about being deluged with paper; the grapevine is the most used,
though least preferred, way of finding out about things.
There are even national norms for employee attitude survey scores, according
to the International Survey Research organisation: Swiss employees are the
most satisfied, followed by the Dutch. The British are the most
dissatisfied, identifying least with their organisations and feeling most
insecure in their jobs.
The next stage within most organisations, once the predictably uncomfortable
results have been collected, is for collective gloom to set in. For some
companies, the first time such an exercise is conducted will also be the
last - even the results of a pilot may warn senior managers off the idea.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: Employee attitude survey checklist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gain commitment of senior management, clarify objectives and define areas
where company prepared to take action.
Decide between census of employees - probably paper-based - and random
sample - maybe face-to-face interviews.
Conduct pilot.
Design questionnaire - needs experienced help.
Tell employees what is being done: the more internal publicity, the greater
the chances of success.
Guarantee confidentiality.
Consider measures to improve response rate, for example, by holding
supervised completion sessions in company time.
If the survey involves face-to-face interviews, conduct with one or two
employees at a time. Avoid group discussions - difficult to maintain
confidentiality in groups and to enable everyone to have a say.
Produce final report. Distil evidence, reach conclusions and put forward
recommendations. Present to top management.
Report back to employees with summary of main findings. Individual or group
should be made responsible for action following survey findings; monitor
progress.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Management: A mindset to escape from the tiger - Bryan
Webster offers an unconventional view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRYAN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We need to face the unpalatable fact that our national management mindset is
affecting the whole of our national performance. That mindset projects the
manager as troubleshooter, problem-solver, dynamic decision-maker. It is
responsible for our love of organisation charts and job descriptions for
particular managers, so that we know who to blame if things go wrong.
It is underpinned by our ubiquitous appraisal and by our performance-related
pay schemes.
Above all, there is our touching belief that we can improve our businesses
by training managers - the Charter Initiative, MBAs and extremely expensive
Executive Development Programmes.
While we are wasting our time and energy on such a management model they
have discovered something different elsewhere.
The Japanese, for instance, have demonstrated that companies are not
collections of managers, nor even of functions; they are combinations of
interacting processes.
If these processes are understood, refined, controlled and continuously
improved, goes their view, the organisation will achieve its goals.
So what can we learn? If our current management mindset is dragging us down,
what will lift us up? The emerging management is organic rather than
mechanical; rather than attempting to manipulate the ends, top management
seeks to cultivate the capability of the company. We can think of this
capability in three ways.
The first is process capability. Quality of product and service is achieved
by controlling the interacting productive, business and management
processes. Nissan have so developed process control that improvements of 0.6
of a second can now be picked up and implemented.
The second element is organisational capability.
It consists of obvious things such as, buildings, finance, technology,
systems and people, and not so obvious, such as employee goodwill and
behaviour, credibility with customers, market awareness, the ability of the
organisation to learn and, of course, the directing of all these towards a
common goal (management).
Organisational capability is what the Japanese are preserving when they hold
on to their skilled people in a downturn, and what brings them running out
of it.
The third element is personal capability. Everyone, everywhere must keep
their face turned to the real world, and keep learning how to prosper in it.
In particular it means top management encouraging the awkward questions that
challenge their own self satisfaction and so lead them to search for new
learning and new answers.
The world's best companies are already well into the process capability
method of management. Asea Brown Boveri, for instance, has cut its lead
times by an average of 21 per cent and hopes to take them down to 50 per
cent by the end of this year.
To achieve this Percy Barnevik, ABB's chief executive, has changed the role
of his managers from 'a combination of policemen and errand boys; now they
act as support for the workers'. And the workers are working at the
processes.
This way of managing will become common in the next 10-20 years and those
who wish to cling to the manager-dominated model should pay heed to the
parable of the tiger, which is now fast becoming part of management
folklore.
It tells of two hikers, who find themselves facing a man-eating tiger. One
pulls out a pair of trainers and puts them on. 'You must be joking,' says
his companion, 'you can't outrun a tiger.' 'No,' he replies, 'but I can
outrun you.'
I first heard the story six years ago, from a chief executive in one of
Britain's top companies. He thought it was funny.
But in those six years his company lost its profitability, much of its
market and two-thirds of its workforce. Finally, it dispensed with his
services.
He was nearer the tiger than he thought.
The author is an independent management counsellor.
                          *      *      *
Check your organisation's mindset by giving this case study to your
managers:
You discover customers have been told that a particular service is available
from you at half its real cost.  You track the mistake to a particular
section.  The company value statement says it will honour its word, but to
provide the service at the cost quoted will seriously affect quarterly
profits in you unit.
What is to be done?
A manager in a manager-centered company will:
tell staff to stop the service;
drop everything to find out what has gone wrong;
hold meetings to get to the bottom of it;
decide what went wrong; find who is to blame;
if another area is to blame, sort out the manager (unless it is their own
boss);
personally restart the service to show staff how it is to be done;
if individuals are to blame, counsel them or give them a warning;
congratulate self on decisive management
A manager in a process-centered company will:
ask staff to advise customers that service  has been withdrawn;
ask team to investigate, then correct factors within their control;
review team's findings;
review the process by which policies are implemented at unit level;
set right factors external to team; systems, resources, communication;
confirm new procedures and train everyone;
take team through the incident specifically to learn lesson;
give individual help where needed

FT  14 JUN 93 / The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
KENWOOD APPLIANCES, the domestic appliances company that floated last June
and made a profits warning three months later, is expected to report
preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.5m today, up from Pounds 9.3m.
Despite a better second half and the acquisition of Tricom in Hong Kong last
November, earnings per share are unlikely to be ahead as significantly as
expected by some at the float.
The City will be keen to have an update on the restructuring programme at
FKI when the electrical engineering group reports annual results tomorrow.
Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, has seen FKI's share price nearly treble in
value since he was brought in from BTR at the beginning of last year.
Analysts, who expect pre-tax profits to have risen from Pounds 31m to about
Pounds 37m, will also be interested in the state of the group's large US
automotive market.
Granada, the leisure, television and computer services group, is expected to
announce healthy pre-tax profits of about Pounds 67m for the 26 weeks to
March 27. This will compare with Pounds 57m last time although that was for
a 28-week period. Modest progress is expected in both rental and television
with about Pounds 5m profit, against Pounds 4.3m, expected for computer
services. Noting that investors were showing more interest in the leisure
sector, Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at stockbrokers Smith New Court,
said they felt 'comfortable' with Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive.
NFC, the transport and logistics company, is set to report interim profits
on Wednesday of about Pounds 40m, virtually unchanged from a year ago.
Analysts will be watching for further signs of growth from its US logistics
business. They will also want to see the effects of the sale in January of
the company's waste management division. The sale will depress the transport
division's profits, but reduce group interest costs over the year.
Dawson International is due to report its results for the year to March 31
on Thursday. One of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, it is expected
to double profits to Pounds 32.5m. Earnings will grow to 13p (10.4p) per
share.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Economics: Hope of pointers on UK policy from Clarke's first
Mansion House speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the new British chancellor has picked a busy, and
potentially awkward, week to deliver his first pre-budget Mansion House
speech.
Economists are hoping tomorrow's speech will help them form a clearer idea
of what the so-far reticent Mr Clarke has in mind for the UK economy.
He will be speaking after the release of May's industrial production
figures. Manufacturing output is forecast to have risen marginally on the
month. Another fall - following a 0.3 per cent month-on-month fall in April
 -would increase pressure on the new chancellor to ease monetary policy. But
unemployment data later in the week is forecast to show only a slim rise in
the May jobless total following three successive monthly falls.
Other economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in
brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International.
Today: UK, May producer prices index, input (down 0.2 per cent on month, up
7.1 per cent on year), output (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 3.9 per cent on

May consumer prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 4.6 per cent on
year). Sweden, May unemployment rate (7.8 per cent). Switzerland, Bank for
International Settlements annual meeting in Basle. US, April business
inventories (up 0.1 per cent); May Atlanta Fed Index. Hong Kong and
Australia, markets closed for holiday.
Tomorrow: UK, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke delivers Mansion House pre-Budget

permits, April wage settlement increases (up 1 per cent). Japan, April
machine orders excluding electricity and ships (down 13 per cent); May trade
balance (Dollars 8.8bn surplus), May wholesale price index (down 0.2 per
cent on month, 2.9 per cent on year). Australia, April housing finance.
Wednesday: UK, May retail sales (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 3.1 per cent
on year), May PSBR (Pounds 5.2bn). US, May housing starts (1.28m), May
building permits, May industrial production (up 0.2 per cent), May capacity
utilisation (81.4 per cent). Japan, April industrial production, April

FT  14 JUN 93 / Price war by DIY chains 'cost Pounds 45m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE price war between do-it-yourself retailers last year cost the four main
chains an estimated Pounds 45m, says a report published today by Verdict,
the retail market research group.
But the apparent 'truce' since called between the DIY retailers could result
in less volatile sales patterns, greater trust and understanding from
consumers, and ultimately a recovery in profit margins in the sector,
Verdict said.
Some of the Pounds 45m cost last year was accounted for by increased
advertising to promote the discounting campaigns of the DIY retailers, but
most of it was a direct result of reduced margins. The DIY retailers lowered
their prices in an effort to stimulate trade, but did not see the expected
increase in sales volumes. Verdict believed Texas Homecare, the
second-biggest DIY group, started the price war in autumn 1991 in the
mistaken belief that economic recovery was imminent.
Two chains, Homebase and Wickes, eschewed large-scale discounting, and
Verdict said it was 'no coincidence' that these two were the only large DIY
retailers to increase their profits and net margins. Verdict said the price
war was evidence of the relative immaturity of the DIY industry.
Convenience stores, which are grocery shops often open for long hours, now
account for the equivalent of 10 per cent of all grocery sales in the UK
with sales of Pounds 4.2bn last year, according to Corporate Intelligence,
the retail research group.

FT  14 JUN 93 / IRA's 'long arm' reaches for industry: The growing risk to
economic targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA'S bomb attacks last week on a Gateshead gasholder and an Esso petrol
and oil terminal in North Shields have highlighted the security problems
terrorism poses for the owners of industrial installations.
Such complexes offer terrorists an economic target, presenting the
opportunity for dramatic, publicity-generating damage and serious disruption
to business interests.
After last Wednesday's explosion and fire, caused by an IRA attack at
Tyneside's largest gasholder complex, Mr James Marris, chairman of British
Gas Northern, admitted it was impossible to achieve total security at such a
compound.
'I don't think we can stop anybody getting into any of these sites. A
determined intruder can get in almost anywhere,' he said. 'The main thing is
to detect it quickly enough to do something about it.'
Esso, whose North Shields terminal has been attacked by the IRA twice in
seven weeks, refused to discuss its security arrangements at the site, apart
from confirming that it had round-the-clock cover.
An Esso official, stressing the vast acreage of land covered by
installations like oil refineries and petrochemical complexes, endorsed Mr
Marris' comments.
He said: 'I think he is expressing the views of everybody who is involved in
running industrial complexes which have an element of risk about their
operations or products.'
In addition to ensuring that intruders can be quickly detected, management
must ensure procedures are rigorously applied, the official added. Any
breach of security demanded a very thorough investigation, he said, but he
stopped short of suggesting that a repetition could be avoided.
Lessons should be learned and action taken 'to make sure either it can't
happen again or to make sure the risk is managed more tightly', he said.
The Esso site is being closed, a decision taken before the first IRA attack.
Most oil companies employ former police and Army officers as security
advisers and many have contracted out their security. While many companies
are reluctant to talk about their arrangements, British Petroleum said the
recent bombs had led to the tightening of security at sensi-tive sites.
'It's just making people a lot more vigilant,' BP said.
The three gasholders on the Gateshead site attacked last Wednesday have a
total capacity of 7.7m cu ft. The compound is near homes and 400 people were
evacuated for five hours after the explosion and fire. But Mr Marris
insisted that gasholders, which resisted wartime bombing, were 'inherently
safe structures'.
The company said the gas in the holders would not explode unless it was
mixed with air and their structure made that unlikely.
British Gas has fallen victim to four IRA bombs - the recent Warrington
bombing and two sites in London in the 1980s.
'It looks pretty dramatic,' the company said, 'which is why they target
them, but the chances of someone being injured are pretty slim.'
Northumbria police assistant chief constable Mr David Mellish said it
appeared that the terrorists' aim at both sites was maximum damage and
publicity, rather than injury. But because of the petrol and gas involved,
there were potentially tremendous implications, he said.
Tyneside has been targeted by the IRA before. Last May terrorists admitted
planting incendiary devices at the MetroCentre shopping centre, barely a
mile from the Gateshead gasholder site.
The psychological impact of last week's IRA attacks on Tyneside's business
community was compounded by the evacuation of Newcastle's Regent Centre
office complex on Thursday after a telephoned coded warning to a local
newspaper. The complex is the headquarters of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group, Northumbrian Water and Northern Rock. Nothing was found.
North-east England's good road infrastructure is normally cited as an
attraction for inward investors but it is becoming evident that it is also a
bonus for terrorists. Northumbria police last week noted the proximity to
fast roads of the sites on Tyneside targeted by the IRA.
The police declined to comment on speculation that an IRA cell might have
been set up in the region.
Newcastle University politics lecturer Mr David George, a terrorism
specialist, believes that targeting north-east England, along with the
north-west and London, helps the IRA promote its image of omnipotence. 'They
want to show the IRA has a very long arm,' he said.
One of the notable features of the region, which has 350 foreign-owned
plants, is its strength in securing inward investment. It claims to be the
principal European centre for manufacturing investment from the Far East.
But Mr George warned management at these workplaces, as well as the
operators of high-risk sites handling volatile substances, to beware of the
IRA.
He said high-profile plants such as Nissan could be attractive to
publicity-seeking terrorists. They have already targeted foreign-owned
plants in Northern Ireland, even though the IRA has not employed such a
tactic in England yet.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Dairy trade pioneer and peace campaigner: Obituary of Alec
Horsley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER HASKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEC HORSLEY, founder of Northern Foods, one of the largest food
manufacturers in the UK, has died at the age of 90.
Very much an individualist in the mould of enlightened 19th century Quaker
entrepreneurs such as the Cadburys of Bournville and the Rowntrees of York,
his unorthodox approach proved no handicap to the successful development of
what is now the leading UK dairy company and the largest supplier of fresh
foods to retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco.
From a base in Hull in 1932 Horsley started a small business selling Dutch
canned milk to the confectionery industry in the north of England. In 1937
he opened a condensed milk plant near York. By 1956, when his company,
Northern Dairies, went public, it had expanded throughout Yorkshire and the
north Midlands; during the 1960s it extended into the Midlands, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
Before retiring from the chairmanship in 1970 he was instrumental in
establishing the company's trading relationship with Marks and Spencer;
probably the most significant contribution to the company's rapid growth
over the past 20 years.
He remained on the board as a non-executive director until 1987,
participating in further large dairy acquisitions and in Northern Foods'
success in the cake, biscuit and chilled prepared foods markets. Until his
death he was president of the Northern Foods Welfare Association, where his
warm concern was appreciated by the company's thousands of pensioners.
Horsley was born in Derbyshire on September 1 1902. He was educated at St
George's, Harpenden, and at Worcester College, Oxford. His family was
nonconformist; he himself became an energetic member of the Society of
Friends (Quakers), combining a belief in the virtues of private enterprise
with the goal of achieving a fair society through the redistribution of
wealth. Uninterested in accumulating a private fortune - and with an
unqualified attachment to underdogs, whether employees, African students, or
former prisoners down on their luck - he gave most of his money away.
Other than to his company, his family (he is survived by his wife Susan,
five children, 15 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren) and to social
justice, Horsley's life-long commitment was to the peace movement. He was a
founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and later
received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford in
recognition of the part he played in establishing its now distinguished
chair of Peace Studies.
Horsley's annual chairman's statements reflected the personality of the man.
On the one hand he would extol the strengths of his company in progressive,
paternalistic style; on the other he would warn shareholders of their
impending incineration - possibly before the next annual meeting - as a
result of the nuclear arms race. Shareholders, apparently unflinching,
continued to support him. They benefited accordingly.

FT  14 JUN 93 / ITV options reach Brooke today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today be offered a range of options for relaxing the
rules on ITV ownership.
Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, will meet the chairmen of the 14
regional ITV companies to hear whether there is a case for lifting the ban
on the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over.
The five largest companies are all expected to argue for a relaxation -
something that will equally be opposed by middle-ranking broadcasters such
as HTV and Anglia which do not want to be swallowed by their larger ITV
rivals.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television, who has been
campaigning for the freedom to create a smaller number of more substantial
ITV companies, will present four alternatives.
He will argue that one large company should be able either to own:
ITV licences controlling up to 25 per cent of the ITV advertising market.
Up to 25 per cent of the total television advertising market including
Channel 4, breakfast and satellite.
One other large company.
Under a fourth alternative, Mr Hill believes there could be a redefining of
what is considered a large company.
He said yesterday: 'For a single channel to be run by a minimum of nine
companies has got to be absurd.' Apart from unnecessary duplication he
pointed to the 'pathetically long time' it took to get decisions in such a
federal system.
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, will back up his
campaign for a relaxation of rules with a Carlton paper arguing that Pounds
100m a year could be saved by ending unnecessary duplication in areas such
as administration.
HTV and Anglia, supported by Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian
Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company, will vehemently oppose any
piecemeal change in the rules. They will argue that concentration of
ownership in ITV will mean less regional diversity, less competition and
less network production in the regions.
The middle-ranking companies will also emphasise that no ITV company is
about to fail - in spite of increased sums going to the Treasury - so that
there is no need for immediate intervention.
The fact that ITV is hopelessly split on the ownership issue will probably
make it less likely that Mr Brooke will decide to change the provisions of
the 1990 Broadcasting Act so soon after their implementation.

NEARLY HALF of the smaller pension schemes for British companies give their

Nearly two fifths of schemes rely on circulating only summarised accounts to

FT  14 JUN 93 / Building society in property deal talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE BUILDING Soc-iety is negotiating to take a controlling stake in
Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which develops and manages private
rented housing, James Buxton writes.
The transaction involves restructuring Nationwide's Pounds 160m lending to
Quality Street, which showed a loss last year and whose balance sheet is in
deficit, partly because of the fall in property values.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, said yesterday that the
building society had decided to make Quality Street its vehicle for
involvement in the private rented sector, ahead of expected government
measures to encourage private renting.
It would also put about 1,500 of its repossessed properties under Quality
Street's management to be rented out.
Quality Street was formed in 1988 by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, formerly Glasgow's
director of housing. It now manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns
about 2,000.
Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed
and earmarked funds to finance its properties. In 1991 it sold its stake to
Mr Mugnaioni and another director but continued to lend to it.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Labour warns of skill shortages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKILL SHORTAGES represent a 'ticking bomb' under economic recovery,
according to a survey of Training and Enterprise Councils published by the
Labour party today.
The survey was prepared by Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman.
He said that an analysis of labour market information showed:
Skill shortages represented a real constraint on economic recovery.
Employers are already facing difficulty in recruiting appropriately skilled
people in certain occupations.
The basic skills of school leavers were causing employer discontent.
Several other recent surveys have pointed to skill shortages. West London
Tec last week published a report on information technology and said there
was a shortage of appropriately skilled people.
Mr Fatchett said Tecs were already warning that skill shortages represented
a constraint on sustained indus-trial recovery and that such shortages were
most likely to emerge in engineering and high-technology sec-tors.
He said: 'Without a concerted effort from the government industrial recovery
could be choked off by skill constraints before it has hardly begun.'
The survey quoted labour market assessments by several Tecs.
Centec, which covers central London, said in its latest survey: 'What is
clear is that, with current staffing levels pared to the minimum, once
businesses start to prosper again the shift from staff cutbacks to staff
shortages, particularly in the clerical and secretarial area, will happen
very quickly.'
The National Council for Educational Technology, a body funded by the
Department for Education, is today launching a campaign to persuade young
women to take up careers in information technology.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Row with generators threatens 12 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS ABOUT the future of 12 reprieved coal mines have increased following
the insistence by the two main electricity generators that British Coal cut
prices below world levels to reflect stocking costs.
'There is no reason why our shareholders should have to pay stocking costs
for coal we do not need immediately,' said an executive of one generator.
The hardline approach by National Power and PowerGen will anger ministers
because the government has said it will subsidise output from the 12 to meet
the difference between production costs and sale prices.
Unless British Coal can increase sales by 15m tonnes a year it is likely to
have to start closing the pits. They were reprieved less than two months ago
after a public outcry over ministers' plans for further sharp contraction of
the mining industry.
The generators' case for lower prices is based on their argument that
anything they buy will have to be added to stockpiles already big enough to
meet the needs of power stations for six months.
British Coal has already negotiated to sell 40m tonnes of coal to the
generators this year and 30m in each of the next four years.
These sales will, however, provide a market for only the 19 pits which
British Coal considers its core mines. With extra sales to household and
industrial markets looking limited, the generators are British Coal's main
hope for sustaining the 12 reprieved pits.
The company has already offered to cut the price to between 90p and 95p a
gigajoule - a measure of thermal efficiency - less than two thirds the price
in the core contracts.
But that figure compares with a price of about 86p for coal traded in
Rotterdam, where most coal imports to Europe are bought and sold.
Neither PowerGen nor National Power is likely to make any final decisions on
extra purchases before serious negotiations begin between them and British
Coal in the autumn. At these negotiations the generators are likely to
insist on prices lower than 80p.
Some British Coal executives believe the company will have to struggle to
sell even 8m additional tonnes a year to the generators. That makes closures
among the 12 almost inevitable.
In a white paper on coal in March this year, the government promised
subsidies for output from the 12 but was unspecific about how they should be
paid and on what basis they should be calculated. Negotiations between
British Coal and the government on the subsidies are at a preliminary stage.
On the day the white paper was published, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, indicated that up to Pounds 500m would be available for
subsidies.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Outcry at British Gas charges plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by British Gas to increase its transportation charges are threatening
to drag the company into an embarrassing row with its regulator and
competitors just as the inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
into its business is drawing to a close.
British Gas has proposed raising the fees it charges rival shippers for
sending gas through its pipelines, in some cases by as much as 30 per cent.
The company says it has been subsidising the transport charges of rivals for
the past three years in an effort to encourage competition.
Mr John Huggins, director of gas transportation at British Gas, said: 'We
reduced our charges to a point where we didn't recover our full costs in
order to allow competition to happen.' British Gas is allowed to earn a 4.5
per cent rate of return on its pipelines business, but says it has not been
achieving this. In a letter to shippers, Mr Huggins said even the new
arrangements involved the company subsidising shippers' transport costs by
Pounds 30m next year.
Shippers say that British Gas has provided no figures to back its claims. Mr
Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, said: 'It's a one-sided
conversation. We have no basis on which to judge the returns British Gas is
getting from the system.'
Ofgas, the regulator, is also sceptical about British Gas's claims.
Other shippers suggest that British Gas is trying to maximise profits in its
transportation arm because it sees its profits in the domestic market eroded
by strong regulation.
British Gas says that the new charges have been expected for at least a year
and shippers should have seen them coming. The company has deferred for a
year further changes to its transport arrangements.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Directors cool to plea on contracts: Appeal to FTSE-100
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY COMPANIES facing criticism from opponents of rolling contracts for
directors are reluctant to switch to less secure one-year contracts.
Twenty of the big companies in the FTSE-100 share index have directors with
rolling contracts of three years or more, according to Pensions Investment
Research Consultants, an organisation which advises shareholders on
corporate governance matters.
Such contracts, unlike fixed-year contracts, are always assumed to have
three years left before expiry. Shareholders find the contracts expensive
and complain that they lead to complacency.
Postel, Britain's largest pension fund, earlier this month told the
managements of the largest companies in which it invests that it would vote
against long-term contracts for directors.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, the former Treasury adviser who is Postel's chief
executive, has written to the chairmen of all the FTSE-100 companies - in
each of which Postel has about a 2 per cent stake - telling them that he is
'minded' to vote against three-year rolling contracts for directors whenever
they occurred.
But the chief executive of one leading retailer, himself on a long-term
contract, said: 'You can't recruit executives unless you offer long-term
contracts.'
The 20 FTSE-100 companies identified by Pensions Investment Research include
Tesco, Kingfisher, Reuters and United Biscuits. Five of those named are
themselves institutional investors - BAT Industries (parent of Eagle Star
Insurance), National Westminster Bank, Prudential Corporation, Royal
Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance.
Prudential, whose chief executive Mr Mick Newmarch has been outspoken on
corporate governance matters, said the company had no intention of amending
its contract to suit Mr Ross Goobey's objections.
It said: 'We believe that we as a plc should act in the way that companies
we invest in should act. But we don't think this is something which would
give us cause for concern.'
Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at oil services group Lasmo, also on
a three-year rolling contract, said the terms were justified because 'there
is more security for the employee and the employer'. If corporate directors
were forced by their shareholders to sign shorter contracts they would
inevitably seek more generous remuneration, he said.
Mr Hogan said he would be willing to take on a shorter-term contract in
exchange for a more generous performance-related element. 'Doubtless some
companies will change their contract terms,' he said.
Lasmo was criticised earlier this year for a Pounds 2.2m payoff to Mr Chris
Greentree, its former chief executive. Under his three-year rolling contract
he received a settlement worth 2 1/2 years' pay. Several shareholders
recorded their objection by voting against the appointment of directors at
the annual general meeting earlier this year.
Mr Ross Goobey said so far responses to his approach to FTSE-100 chairmen
had not been hostile.
'Most of these have been 'holding' letters saying they thought the point was
interesting and they would like to discuss it further,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Birmingham to bid for Expo 2003
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM business leaders will today seek support in the Commons for a bid
to stage Expo 2003, an international fair, in the city.
They are working through Birmingham City 2000, a professional and financial
services group, and the Chamber of Commerce and want the government to
promote the city's case at the Bureau of International Exhibitions, the
inter-governmental organisation based in Paris which controls the timing and
location of international fairs.
The move of Birmingham lobbying to the Commons in the search for
parliamentary backing for the idea follows two years of preparatory work and
the completion of a feasibility study by Planning Industrial Economic
Development Advisers of Edinburgh.
Mr Bob Moore, chief executive of Birmingham City 2000, said the Birmingham
fair would not be on the same scale as that held in Seville, Spain, last
year, when 40m visitors attended Expo over six months. Birmingham is looking
for 6m visitors over three months.
Expo in Seville cost the Spanish government Pounds 1.1bn, while the UK
government spent Pounds 25m on a British pavilion.
Mr Moore said: 'At current prices the cost in Birm-ingham would be around
Pounds 25m. The amount required is less than half the amount given to
Manchester for the Olympics.'
Existing facilities such as the National Exhibition Centre and the
International Convention Centre would be used.
The private-sector bid for Expo 2003 is supported by the Labour-controlled
city council. It is the second Birmingham bid for a big international event
in recent years. In the 1980s the city made an unsuccessful attempt to host
the 1998 Olympic Games.

Mr Huggins said: 'We consider we've gone far enough and will stand firm on

The dispute centres on the planned charges by British Gas for connecting to
the gas grid new industrial sites supplied by its rivals. In many cases
these tariffs are 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher than charges levied on
existing sites. Charges for existing sites will be increased in October next
year.
Several shippers have made formal complaints to Ofgas and some are in
negotiations with British Gas to try to secure lower rates.
Ofgas has asked British Gas to explain the reasoning behind the increases in
a bid to resolve the dispute.
Mr Greg MacGregor at Ofgas said: 'Ofgas has the ability to direct British
Gas to adopt what we think of as appropriate transport terms, but we don't
want it to get to that stage.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / Building society in property deal talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE BUILDING Society is negotiating to take a controlling stake in
Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which develops and manages private
rented housing.
The transaction involves restructuring Nationwide's Pounds 160m lending to
Quality Street which showed a loss last year and whose balance sheet is in
deficit, partly because of the fall in property values.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, said yesterday that the
building society had decided to make Quality Street its vehicle for
involvement in the private rented sector, ahead of expected government
measures to encourage private rent-ing.
It would also put about 1,500 of its repossessed properties under Quality
Street's management to be rented out. Further transfers could double Quality
Street's size.
Quality Street was formed in 1988 by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, formerly Glasgow's
director of housing. It now manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns
about 2,000 and sees itself as a 'blue-chip' private landlord.
It has built far fewer homes than it hoped, however, because the returns on
rented housing are not high enough to attract investors.
It showed a loss of Pounds 9m in the year to March 1992, mainly because
accounting standards required it to show the redemption premium on a loan
from Nationwide on its profit and loss account, which also reduced its
reserves.
In 1992 its liabilities of Pounds 142m exceeded its assets by Pounds 6m.
Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed
and earmarked substantial funds to finance its properties.
In 1991 it sold its equity stake to Mr Mugnaioni and another director but
continued to lend to it.
Mr Melville-Ross said that the building society was not worried about its
loans to Quality Street.
He said: 'We could have left things as they were but we decided it was more
sensible to take a controlling interest. The climate is changing towards
renting.'
The size of Nationwide's stake in Quality Street is still under negotiation
but it will be more than 50 per cent.

FT  14 JUN 93 / BSI chief resigns in 'disagreement'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL SANDERSON, first chief executive of the British Standards
Institution, has resigned unexpectedly after 18 months. The BSI co-ordinates
the writing of standards for industry.
Mr Sanderson's resignation, which took effect on June 1 but has only now
emerged, followed what the BSI called 'a deep disagreement with the board on
important matters of policy and management'.
He joined BSI from AWD Bedford Trucks, where he had been managing director.
'I am very sad,' he said. 'It was a wonderful job. I think we were making
significant progress.'
A metallurgist by training, Mr Sanderson, who is now 49, was appointed in
November 1991 to spearhead the modernisation of the organisation. The BSI
said at the time that his task would be to 'lead a major programme of
cultural change'. His departure leaves the organisation without a chief
executive at a time of growing interest in the issue of standards.
BS5750, a quality systems standard, has become the focus of growing
controversy with criticism from small businesses that it is unduly
bureaucratic while the creation of the single European market has increased
the need for a strong British voice in the writing of European and
international standards.
Neither the BSI nor Mr Sanderson would comment further on the reasons for
his departure. Mr Sanderson was on a renewable 12-month contract.
Day-to-day management of BSI has been taken over by a three-man board
committee headed by Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman. He said:
'There is no question of any change of strategic emphasis and we will pursue
our objectives with the utmost vigour.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / MPs demand copier leases change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN to extend greater protection to customers of controversial
photocopying leasing contracts will be stepped up tomorrow when a group of
MPs meets Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, to press for changes
in the law.
The photocopying business has been the target of widespread allegations
about high-pressure sales techniques which have led many businesses and
organisations to sign onerous and unfair leasing contracts.
The Office of Fair Trading announced in February, in response to more than
3,000 complaints of malpractice and contract abuse, that it was launching an
inquiry into the hiring and leasing of office equipment.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has also just
submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry the initial conclusions of
a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
He is believed to have told the department that, among other measures to
improve consumer law, there is a case for widening the legal protection
available on contracts involving private individuals to small businesses and
other incorporated bodies.
Changes could mean that bodies such as schools, hospitals, clubs and
charities - all of which have alleged being tricked into expensive contracts
 -would win a two-week 'cooling off' period after signing up. The present
Pounds 15,000 ceiling on such contracts could also be raised, possibly as
high as Pounds 50,000.
Companies which break the law can have their consumer credit licences
revoked by the OFT, which has warned that it will do so if it finds
evidence.
Members of the Campaign to Clean Up Photocopier Contracts, which has
gathered more than 3,300 complaints from customers - particularly those
taking out cost-per-copy-agreements - will also attend tomorrow's meeting,
which is being led by Mr Nick Hawkins, Conservative MP for Blackpool South.
A spokesman said the campaign was still receiving complaints and would
continue to press ministers for action.
Some of the leading photocopier leasing companies have responded to recent
criticism by establishing a trade association to promote good practice.

<DATELINE>
   AN ORGANISATION to protect 'whistleblowers'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
employees who disclose confidential information in what they judge to be the
public interest - has been formed to provide guidance to companies as well
as independent help to individuals.
Separate codes of practice on how to deal with whistleblowers are being set
up for a number of sectors, including accounting, auditing and eduction.
The primary aim of the group will be to persuade companies to adopt the
codes of practice. The group, Public Concern at Work, is headed by Mr Guy
Dehn, a solicitor formerly with the National Consumer Council.
Professor Gerald Vinten of Luton University College, who is also involved in
the group, told a recent conference of the Institute of Personnel Management
that organisations should not necessarily view whistleblowing negatively.
Research had shown that whistleblowers were often regarded as a model
employees in all other respects, so it was a waste for companies to forfeit
their services, he said.
Prof Vinten said a survey of 87 whistleblowers in the US had found that all
but one had experienced retaliation, with harassment coming from peers as
well as superiors. Most of those in private industry and half of those in
the Civil Service had lost their jobs.
Prof Vinten said organisations should make clear that they 'valued employees
being ethically alert and, therefore, individuals who did blow the whistle
would not be discriminated against'.
Codes of practice would give employees a reference point to enable them to
identify when it was valid for them to take up a particular issue and how to
go about it, he told the IPM. Codes should include guidance on who an
employee should speak to, ethical dilemmas and ways of coping, and give a
clear statement from the company of the ethical conduct it intended to
follow.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Failure of computers 'may kill'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEATHS AND serious injuries caused by computer system failures are likely
within a few years unless a shortage of experienced safety engineers is
eased, the British Computer Society warned yesterday.
It said there might be more cases like that of the London Ambulance Service
unless the number of computer specialists qualified to build, inspect and
approve 'safety-critical' systems increased sharply. Poor system design and
management in the London service led to unacceptable delays in the arrival
of ambulances.
Safety-critical systems are computer systems which can lead to injuries or
deaths if they go wrong.
The London ambulance system was never declared safety-critical and was not
inspected by qualified safety experts.
Professor John Cullyer of Warwick University, chairman of a society task
force, said yesterday that computers were spreading rapidly through society.
But the training of experts in safety-critical methods was lagging behind.
He said it was impossible to put a figure on the number of extra engineers
needed, but specialists were already overstretched.
Companies qualified to carry out safety-critical inspections included
Roll-Royce, BAe-Sema, Program Validation and Thorn EMI.
Prof Cullyer, a consultant to the US space programme, said that by the turn
of the century most passenger cars would have six or more microprocessors,
at least two of them controlling potentially life-threatening functions such
as braking or suspension alignment.
Prof Cullyer said the recession in the UK had caused a sharp reduction in
training which was making the shortage worse and had serious implications
for safety over the next decade.
He said it took about 10 years for a computer engineer to gain the
experience and maturity needed to work on safety-critical systems.
Statutory regulations in the UK designed to ensure that a new computer
system passes inspection cover only the aerospace, nuclear and toxic
chemicals industries.
Defence systems are covered by rigorous standard procedures set by the
Ministry of Defence, but are not statutory.
Industries where there is no statutory requirement to have new systems
tested and approved include medical electronics, motor electronics and
manufacturing.
Prof Cullyer said a principal concern was that small companies, many of them
developing innovative and advanced systems, had neither the resources nor
incentive to ask for independent inspection of their work.
A policy statement prepared by the society's task force warns that some of
the science and technology needed to design and assess safety-critical
systems is not yet fully developed and calls on the government and the
Science and Engineering Research Council to support the necessary research
and development.
It calls for a system of registration with mandatory fault reporting for
safety-critical systems so minimum standards can be enforced.

FT  14 JUN 93 / ICL faces action by ex-manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER ICL manager, linked to an investigation into alleged irregularities
involving contracts placed with the company by the Ministry of Defence, said
he was seeking legal aid to seek compensation in the civil courts for an
alleged persecution campaign.
He said he also wanted to sue his former employer, an ICL subsidiary, for
wrongful dismissal and commission which he claims is owing.
Ministry of Defence police raided ICL's offices in Slough, Stevenage and
Basingstoke on Friday and removed documents. A ministry spokeswoman said she
could not indicate when the results of the investigation would be made
public.
Mr Richard Livesey-Haworth, ICL's group executive director, said he was
'incredulous' at the suggestion that ICL, the UK company owned by the
Japanese company Fujitsu, would persecute a former employee.
He also said that the ICL main board would have had no detailed knowledge of
the contracts in question. Contracts of the size under investigation would
be solely a matter for the subsidiary concerned and would never come before
the executive board. Only two individual contracts had been discussed by the
board in recent years, each of them multi-million pound deals.
Mr David May, formerly an MoD account manager for the ICL division ICTS, now
a wholly owned subsidiary named Workplace Technologies, said he was made
redundant after warning senior managers that the company would make
excessive profits on certain contracts. He told the FT yesterday that he had
not spoken to the ICL board.
He also said yesterday that he had subsequently made these allegations to
MoD police.
Mr May worked for the subsidiary between 1990 and 1992. It supplies cabling
and office services to customers including the ministry, whose account Mr
May handled.
Mr May said he took his story to The Sunday Times, which contacted the
ministry.
Mr Livesey-Haworth said yesterday that as the ministry had made no formal
allegations of wrongdoing it was impossible to comment on Mr May's claims.
In his opinion, however, the investigation had been instigated by 'a
disgruntled ex-employee'. ICL would continue to co-operate fully with the
investigation.
ICL was, however, talking to its lawyers and would take action to protect
itself against libel and slander, he added.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Employer policies on race probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality is to launch a formal investigation into
the employment practices of the 400 largest private-sector employers in
Britain.
The exercise, the largest of its kind conducted by the commission, is
intended to collect information about how far companies are following
government guidelines on the appointment and promotion of ethnic-minority
employees.
The commission says it will not attempt to 'catch employers out' during the
investigation. The commission may, however, use the results to press for
legislation to be strengthened and the 10-year-old Race Relations Code of
Practice, which accompanies the 1976 Race Relations Act, to be updated.
A pilot questionnaire has been sent to 18 volunteer companies, including
Kingfisher, Boots and National Westminster Bank. The full survey of
remaining companies, each with a minimum of 7,000 employees, is likely to go
out in July, with publication of the findings early next year.
Ms Mary Coussey, the commission's employment director, said that informal
contacts 'tend to suggest there's a minority of 'good' employers who have
done a fair bit, but their number hasn't grown very much in recent years'.
Last year the Department of Employment issued a 10-point plan for employers
on how to implement equal opportunities, including race equality policies
and practices. The plan recommends companies should develop an equal
opportunities policy, set an action plan, provide training for all, and
monitor progress in achieving objectives.
Mr Tony Ward, Kingfisher's director of human resources and a senior CRE
commissioner, said he thought the investigation would show that most
companies had equal opportunity policies on race but they were 'not
necessarily measuring how effective they were'.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Sweeping reforms of tax proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR-REACHING tax reforms, including new ways of taxing international
companies, and local referenda over tax levels are called for in a pamphlet
published today by Demos, an independent think tank set up to explore
radical solutions to long-term problems.
Voters are unwilling to vote for tax increases, according to Demos, yet
governments find it impossible to cut public spending. Taxes have become
'disconnected' from the services they finance, and taxpayers do not believe
that higher taxes will produce better services.
At the same time, the globalisation of production makes it harder for
governments to raise taxes from business. International companies use
low-tax countries to locate factories and declare profits.
New strategies are needed to break these fiscal deadlocks facing governments
across the world, Demos says.
One reason voters are reluctant to support higher taxes is that financing
public spending through general taxation has lost legitimacy, it says.
In a less deferential consumer society citizens want to know where their
money is going, and are suspicious of tax increases which are spent through
behind-the-scenes negotiations in Whitehall.
This problem could be overcome by linking tax revenues much more closely
with the programmes they finance, Demos says. Taxes should be 'reconnected'
to the services they pay for by earmarking particular taxes for specific
purposes.
This should be combined with a transfer of tax and spending power back to
local authorities, with local referenda on spending over government limits.
On health spending, Demos suggests that voters could be consulted on an
additional Pounds 34-a-year tax, which would be used to increase real
National Health Service funding by the 2 per cent a year needed to maintain
the quality of service.
A London Transport referendum could test support for an extra Pounds
1-a-week tax on every household to create a world-class underground system.
Businesses could also be polled on a levy through the business rate to
improve London's infrastructure.
The pamphlet advocates a global approach to business taxation, to avoid
competitive tax-cutting. It suggests that the European Community should
establish a common European corporate tax, collected by an EC agency.
It would focus on the top 100 European companies whose sales account for 40
per cent of EC GDP, and encourage harmonisation of accounting standards
between member states.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Nadir seeks to revoke power given to trustee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, has attempted to revoke the power
of attorney which he gave to his trustee in bankruptcy in renewed efforts
formally to regain control of his assets.
Mr Neil Cooper, the trustee from accountants Robson Rhodes, confirmed
yesterday that he had received a letter in Turkish and English signed by Mr
Nadir on Friday. The letter withdrew Mr Cooper's right to act on behalf of
Mr Nadir.
If Mr Nadir's revocation is accepted, it will further threaten attempts by
the trustee to keep control of assets in Turkey on behalf of creditors.
It could also prove politically embarrassing for the Turkish government,
which has been in talks with the Serious Fraud Office and the British
authorities about the former head of Polly Peck International. The action
comes just in advance of Tuesday's preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey on
Mr Nadir's case, at which lawyers representing Mr Cooper will claim rights
to Pounds 2m of Mr Nadir's Pounds 3.5m bail money which he forfeited by
fleeing to Northern Cyprus last month. Mr Cooper said documents he had
obtained after raids on Mr Nadir's London home just before and after the
businessman fled from the UK showed that he had provided Pounds 2m towards
his own bail. Previously it had been believed that the money was put up by
friends, but according to Mr Cooper the documents suggest a 'back-to-back'
arrangement by which Mr Nadir had his own money filtered through two banks
to conceal its origin before it was passed to his solicitors as cash
security for bail. One of the banks was Impexbank, a Turkish bank once owned
by Mr Nadir.
Mr Cooper said he was taking legal advice on whether Mr Nadir's letter
attempting to revoke power of attorney would be accepted. 'This is
incompatible with the noises he was making that he was about to do the
decent thing by Polly Peck shareholders,' he said.
Mr Cooper also revealed that he was considering action against Aysegul, Mr
Nadir's former wife, in connection with 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' of
his assets, including works of art, which had reached her in the past five
years.

ABOLISHING the requirement for small companies to have an annual audit would
reduce standards and increase the rate of business failures, the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants warned yesterday.
The association was responding to Department of Trade and Industry proposals
published earlier this year to lift the requirement for a statutory annual
audit for companies below the registration threshold for value added tax -
presently Pounds 37,600 a year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, home secretary, yesterday came down firmly in favour of
deregulating Sunday shop opening hours, saying that he did not believe any
other alternative would work.
Mr Howard said, however, that MPs would still be given a choice of four
options for reforming Britain's widely-discredited Sunday trading laws and
hinted that he was prepared to listen to arguments for a compromise
solution. Speaking on BBC Television, Mr Howard made clear his preference
for extending the Conservatives' free-market economics to the high street.
The Home Office will publish a draft Sunday trading bill before the Commons
recess which starts at the end of next month. The four choices are:
Total deregulation with shops able to open on Sundays like any other day.
Partial deregulation with larger shops restricted to six hours opening and
smaller shops totally deregulated.
Limiting opening to convenience stores and sales of emergency supplies.
A complex compromise that would allow all shops to open on the four Sundays
before Christmas but only certain categories of shops to open on other
Sundays.

FT  14 JUN 93 / BSI chief resigns after rift on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL SANDERSON, first chief executive of the British Standards
Institute, has resigned unexpectedly after 18 months, Charles Batchelor
writes. The BSI co-ordinates the writing of standards for industry.
Mr Sanderson's resignation, which took effect on June 1 but has only now
become known, followed what the BSI called 'a deep disagreement with the
board on important matters of policy and management'.
He joined BSI from AWD Bedford Trucks, where he had been managing director.
'I am very sad,' he said. 'It was a wonderful job. I think we were making
significant progress.'
Mr Sanderson, who is now 49, was appointed in November 1991 to spearhead the
modernisation of the organisation. The BSI said at the time that his task
would be to 'lead a major programme of cultural change'. His departure
leaves the organisation without a chief executive at a time of growing
interest in the issue of standards.
BS5750, a quality systems standard, has become the focus of growing
controversy with criticism from small businesses that it is unduly
bureaucratic.
Neither the BSI nor Mr Sanderson would comment further on the reasons for
his departure.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Aintree rejects National criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AINTREE RACECOURSE officials yesterday rejected criticisms by an inquiry
into the false starts at the Grand National in April, but said starting
procedures would be changed for next year's race.
The world's most popular steeplechase, watched by 50,000 on-course
spectators and millions of television viewers worldwide, had to be abandoned
after two false starts.
The inquiry, headed by Mr Justice Connell, a member of the Jockey Club,
horseracing's ruling body, yesterday strongly criticised the 'grey gate'
starting system - a tape stretched across the 65-yard width of the course -
as outdated and inadequate. It said the Aintree executive and the Jockey
Club should have replaced it.
Captain Keith Brown, the race starter, was criticised for allowing the
horses to line up too close to the tape. Each false start was declared after
horses broke the tape and became entangled in it.
Failure to recall 30 jockeys who continued to race after the second false
start was due to Mr Ken Evans, the recall man stationed down the course, the
report said.
Although it would be 'unfair and unrealistic' for Mr Evans to carry the sole
blame for the affair, he was positioned too near the starting gate and had
failed to wave a red flag to signal the false starts, the report said.
Mr Charles Barnett, Aintree's managing director, said changes would be
introduced after the Jockey Club's inquiry into starting systems reported
later this summer.
However, he rejected any responsibility for the pro-cedures criticised by
the inquiry. The 'grey gate' system was approved by the Jockey Club and had
operated successfully in pre-race tests, he said.
Mr Barnett said the inquiry's comments on Mr Evans, who was 'under the
direct control of the starter', were unfair. There was no evidence to
contradict his claim that he raised his recall flag after both false starts.
The stewards of the Jockey Club will study the report today before deciding
whether to initiate a disciplinary inquiry.
The Jockey Club has wide-ranging powers which include imposing fines on both
Mr Evans and Aintree racecourse.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Redwood puts Thatcherite zeal on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the rightwing Welsh secretary, made clear at the weekend
his opposition to income-tax increases and excessive public-spending cuts as
he tried to reassure the principality that nothing would be put in the way
of economic recovery.
At the Welsh Conservative party conference in Llangollen he signalled in his
first speech as Welsh secretary that his Thatcherite economics and
privatisation zeal have been put on hold.
His comments highlighted the reservations in the government about the large
public-spending cuts urged by some Tory MPs. It lined Mr Redwood up as a
cabinet ally of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who has set economic
recovery as his 'first aim'.
Mr Redwood said that under his leadership the Welsh Office would be
committed to 'putting the search for work and investment at the top of the
agenda'. The Welsh secretary, a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back
Group, made only one reference to privatisation - a boast that as a junior
trade and industry minister he had not sold Cardiff-based Companies House.
He told Welsh Tories: 'Recovery is the best way of stopping the deficit. We
should never put tackling the deficit above the needs of the elderly, the
disabled, the disadvantaged, who cannot compete in the marketplace.'
He said the Tory 1992 election manifesto had opposed income-tax increases.
'It was right then. It's right today.'
On the government's public spending review, he said: 'Some urge us to make
deep cuts in public spending now. They fear otherwise markets will have
their way and lose confidence. Yet markets will take confidence if recovery
continues and strengthens.'
Mr Redwood, under attack from political opponents and under suspicion from
some Welsh Tories for his firmly English roots, said there 'has always been
a welcome in the hillsides for Englishman in love with the Welsh rhythms and
landscape'.
He would be supporting Wales in football and Glamorgan at cricket. He even
made an enthusiastic stab at singing the Welsh national anthem. Speaking to
journalists, Mr Redwood said Mr John Major and Mr Clarke were right to
review all parts of public spending, but he said he had set out 'the
strategy'.
He hinted that he saw public-spending savings coming more from controlling
pay.

Speaking on BBC television, Mr Howard made clear his preference for

doubtful that anything other than deregulation will actually provide a
really effective answer, but that is doubtless something that will be
explored in coming months,' he said.
The Home Office will publish a draft Sunday trading bill before the Commons
recess which starts at the end of next month. Legislation is expected to be
introduced in the session of parliament starting in November.
The options will split the Conservative party, in which the Keep Sunday
Special lobby has substantial support.
Government business whips will allow Tory MPs a free vote, but Mr Howard did
not rule out the possibility that no option would win a majority. By setting
out his own preference he might have been hoping to increase the chances of
MPs rallying around one option.
The four choices to be voted on by MPs are:
:Total deregulation with shops able to open on Sundays like any other day.
Partial deregulation with larger shops restricted to six hours opening on
Sundays and smaller shops totally deregulated.
Limiting Sunday opening to convenience stores and sales of emergency

SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday ruled out any
attempt by Britain to force a new system of government on the province - in
spite of the refusal of Unionist politicians to join fresh 'round-table'
talks, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, are to meet
on Wednesday as part of the twice-yearly meetings between the two intended
to improve relations between the countries.
But Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two main Unionist
leaders, have hardened their opposition to talks. Mr Molyneaux said past
political initiatives had increased uncertainty in the province, putting
people's lives at risks. He opposed 'these circus operations for
international consumption'.
On BBC Television Sir Patrick reaffirmed his commitment to finding agreement
between nationalist and unionist communities.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Hope for two BES schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank and BZW, the securities house owned by Barclays
Bank, may earn a reprieve for their business expansion schemes which failed
to qualify for tax relief after Budget changes.
Mr John Watts, the conservative MP and chairman of the Treasury select
committee, has tabled a proposed amendment to the Finance Bill which would
make the schemes eligible for tax relief.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in his Budget speech that
shares in BES companies had to be issued by midnight before the Budget if
loans were to be made against them.
Non-recourse loans allowed investors to withdraw their investments after
only six months instead of five years, while retaining full BES tax relief
at their top marginal rate. This tax relief was intended to be available
only to those who maintained their investment for five years.
BZW's Gracechurch companies were launched at the end of February and raised
their full subscription of Pounds 25m. NatWest's Homeshare scheme was
launched in the first week of March and raised the full subscription of
Pounds 25m. The shareholdings were not listed in the companies' register of
members by the Budget deadline.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Company boards reluctant to end long-term contracts: The
campaign against big payoffs for directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, BRITAIN'S largest pension fund, earlier this month fired a shot
across the bows of the largest companies it invests in, telling their
managements that it would vote against long-term contracts for directors.
Whether the shot reverberates in boardrooms across Britain or merely lands
with a plop remains to be seen. For while corporate boards are slowly giving
in to shareholder pressure on some issues, they are showing few signs of
budging on others.
The chief executive of one leading retailer, himself on a long-term
contract, said: 'You can't recruit executives unless you offer long-term
contracts.'
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, the former Treasury adviser who is Postel's chief
executive, wrote to the chairmen of all the FTSE-100 companies - in which
Postel has about a 2 per cent stake - telling them that he was 'minded' to
vote against three-year rolling contracts for directors whenever they
occurred.
Such contracts, unlike fixed-year contracts, are always assumed to have
three years left before expiry. Not only do shareholders find them
expensive, but they complain they lead to complacency among those who least
ought to feel that way.
Mr Ross Goobey said so far responses to his letter had not been hostile.
'Most of these have been 'holding' letters saying they thought the point was
interesting and they would like to discuss it further,' he said.
That, however, is a far cry from saying that boards will mend their ways. To
date, none of Britain's leading shareholder groups has committed itself to
voting with Mr Ross Goobey.
The issue of how long a director's service contract should be is one that
has exercised shareholders for some time. Typically, the matter rises to the
top of the corporate governance agenda after the discovery that some
particularly incompetent director has received a big payout after
shareholders have sacked him.
In most circumstances it emerges that the director was entitled to a large
payout because he had up to five years remaining on a service contract.
Pensions Investment Research Consultants, an organisation which advises
shareholders on corporate governance matters, has found that 20 of the top
FTSE-100 companies have directors with rolling contracts of three years or
longer.
The list includes Tesco, Kingfisher, Reuters and United Biscuits.
Ironically, five of those named are themselves institutional investors - BAT
Industries (parent of Eagle Star Insurance), National Westminster Bank,
Prudential Corporation, Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance.
Prudential, whose chief executive Mr Mick Newmarch has been outspoken on
corporate governance matters, said the company had no intention of amending
its contract to suit Mr Ross Goobey's objections.
It said: 'We believe that we as a plc should act in the way that companies
we invest in should act. But we don't think this is something which would
give us cause for concern.'
Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at oil services group Lasmo, himself
on a three-year rolling contract, said the terms were justified because
'there is more security for the employee and the employer'. If corporate
directors were forced by their shareholders to sign shorter contracts they
would inevitably seek more generous remuneration, he said.
Mr Hogan said he would be willing to take on a shorter-term contract in
exchange for a more generous performance-related element. 'Doubtless some
companies will change their contract terms,' he said.
Lasmo was criticised earlier this year for a Pounds 2.2m payoff to Mr Chris
Greentree, its former chief executive. Under his three-year rolling contract
he received a settlement worth two-and-a-half years' pay. Several
shareholders recorded their objection by voting against the appointment of
directors at the annual general meeting earlier this year.
Yet prospects that such activities will quickly force companies to mend
their ways are limited. One shareholder said: 'We registered our objections
to the chairman and he told us that our views were duly noted and our votes
counted.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / Turkey's first woman PM must reforge party image: Ciller
offers change from grey-suited political mainstream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Tansu Ciller, a former economy minister, is to be predominantly Moslem
Turkey's first woman prime minister after being elected leader of the
largest party in parliament yesterday.
Mrs Ciller, a 47-year-old academic economist better known for the fact that
her husband took her maiden name, won 574 votes in the True Path party's
leadership race - just 11 short of an absolute majority of those eligible to
vote - on the first ballot. Interior minister Ismet Sezgin, with 320 votes,
and education minister Koksal Toptan, with 212, then withdrew their
candidacy. She will be sworn in today.
A welcome foil to the drab, grey-suited male politicians of Turkey's
mainstream, Mrs Ciller will have to reforge the party's image in the wake of
Mr Suleyman Demirel's move to the presidency, which led to yesterday's
leadership contest.
Party strengths in parliament are finely balanced. Her first task will be to
choose a cabinet in coalition with the junior partners Social Democratic
Populists (SHP) after the announcement that Mr Erdal Inonu, SHP leader,
would stand down in September.
Written off by many commentators when she was first elected to cabinet in
1991, Mrs Ciller emerged a surprising winner, apparently convincing
delegates that she offered the better chance for re-election, rather than
the respected but uninspiring Mr Sezgin, her main challenger.
Mrs Ciller faces the difficult task of rebuilding the party ahead of vital
municipal elections next year. A staunch European who speaks good English
and German, Mrs Ciller is likely to accelerate Turkey's economic convergence
with the European Community. She is expected to speed up the privatisation
of state enterprises, which lose an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a
year.
Her anti-inflation policy has proven more controversial and brought her near
to open conflict with Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor. Mr
Saracoglu's future must now be in doubt.
Mrs Ciller has cut a curious figure in her Chanel suits assiduously courting
the party's predominantly Moslem constituents with claims that the call to
prayer makes her 'feel good'.
Addressing the congress of 1,169 DYP delegates, Mrs Ciller promised
yesterday she would visit Germany in the wake of right-wing attacks on
Turkish families in a number of German cities - another gesture to rural
supporters.
She faces an urgent policy agenda - from annual inflation, which is running
at more than 60 per cent, and the bloody Kurdish rebellion on the domestic
front to an arc of foreign policy concerns from the Caucasus, north Iraq and
the Balkans.
During 20 months as chief economics minister she has overseen a radical
trade reform, moving the country back on track for full customs union with
the European Community in 1995. Following legislative changes the stock
exchange has enjoyed a renewed lease of life. Before the vote this weekend,
the index had reached a record.
She has had mixed fortunes in her anti-inflation policy centred on
restructuring the government's domestic debt, which has put downward
pressure on interest rates. Debt service, at about 40 per cent of recurrent
budget expenditures, fuelled the public sector's borrowing requirement,
running at close to 12 per cent of gross national product.
Mrs Ciller first came to attention when commissioned by the Istanbul
Businessmen's Association to produce a report on Turkey's debt during the
former Motherland party administration. Her findings were so critical it
brought the association into direct conflict with then prime minister, Mr
Turgut Ozal.
She will want to keep her distance from Mr Demirel, whose accession to the
presidency created this leadership race.
Mr Demirel for his part will want to counter the impression that he opposed
Mrs Ciller's candidacy.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Mediators renew Bosnia initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENICES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, met
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva yesterday as part of renewed
diplomatic efforts to end the slaughter in the former Yugoslav republic,
agencies report.
The talks coincided with reports that Serb rockets destroyed a temporary
hospital, killing 52 patients and medical staff, in the blockaded east
Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. The death toll, if independently
confirmed, would be one of the worst in a single incident in the 14-month
war between Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serb communities.
The talks, a day after the mediators met Croat leaders, focused on the
growing conflict between the Moslem-led government and its former Croat
allies. Lord Owen said that one of the main aims of the discussions was to
alleviate fighting between Moslems and Croats 'but the essential task is
still the overall peace settlement'.
Shortly after the talks, Moslem, Croat and Serb members of Bosnia's
collective presidency gathered at the UN's European headquarters for a
special session and ordered a truce between Moslem and Croat forces. But
diplomats voiced scepticism about a ceasefire holding.
The presidency also demanded the immediate deployment of United Nations
peacekeepers to stem the bloodshed in Gorazde, one of six Moslem 'safe
areas' designated by the UN. So far, besieging Serb militiamen have
prevented UN forces from gaining access to the enclave.
Lord Owen said that despite the deteriorating situation on the ground, the
two international mediators were still trying to find a diplomatic solution
that would enable Moslems, Croats and Serbs to live together within a single
state.
UN commanders, meanwhile, have called a meeting of Serb, Croat and Moslem
army chiefs to take place at Sarajevo airport tomorrow to discuss a lasting
ceasefire.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to gather leaders of all the Bosnian
factions, as well as Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, for talks in Geneva on Wednesday.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has told Japanese hosts of next month's Group of

want back from Russia, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
In comments which are likely to be seen by Tokyo as insulting, he said on
Saturday he felt 'a certain discomfort' as there would be a meeting with Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, and the question of the islands
would come up. 'I will not be able to tell him anything new.'
Mr Yeltsin, who is expected to discuss aid for Russian economic reforms with
G7 leaders in Tokyo, is also likely to touch on bilateral issues in talks
with Mr Miyazawa.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that the shadowy security council - a committee of
senior officials that deals with foreign and some domestic affairs, in
addition to security - is to be headed by Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov,
previously head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' unified command.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Germany's SPD picks Scharping to be new leader
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old premier of the west German state of the
Rhineland-Palatinate, emerged yesterday as the certain new leader of the
opposition Social Democrats, and the man most likely to challenge Chancellor
Helmut Kohl for his job in next year's elections.
He won a clear victory over his two rivals in yesterday's unprecedented
'primary' vote of party members. Mr Scharping will be formally proposed as
national chairman today at the national executive meeting of the SPD and his
position needs to be confirmed at a party conference on June 25.
The vote reflects hesitant steps by the troubled opposition towards the
centre ground of German politics, and amounts to a setback for the more
radical policies espoused by Mr Scharping's rivals.
His victory will be greeted with relief by the party establishment, who
feared the ambition of his main rival, Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Lower Saxony
premier. Mr Scharping - a life-long politician, first as a research
assistant and then serving in his state parliament - is seen as a safe pair
of hands, likely to follow the cautious centrism of Mr Bjorn Engholm, the
former party chairman, who resigned last month following a political scandal
in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Mr Scharping will, however, have a huge task to raise his political profile
in less than 18 months before the next election, against the dominant, if
unpopular, figure of Mr Kohl. According to an opinion poll published
yesterday by the ntv television station, 52 per cent of those asked felt
unable to say if he was doing a good or bad job because they did not know
him.
He was described at the weekend by Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the retiring leader
of the Free Democratic party, as 'mouse grey'.
More than 70 per cent of voters - including 33 per cent of SPD supporters -
believe that Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union will win the next election
and decide the chancellor, although the SPD and CDU are roughly equal in
electoral support.
Mr Schroder, 49, who started the leadership campaign as favourite, and Ms
Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, 50, who sought to consolidate the left-wing vote
in the party, both conceded defeat last night and threw their weight behind
Mr Scharping.
Mr Schroder had fought on the basis of a firm commitment to a coalition with
the Green party at next year's elections, which almost certainly cost him
votes, whereas Mr Scharping has left all his options open.
The victor won a majority in all the most populous German states, with the
exception of Lower Saxony, and in all the states of eastern Germany, except
Berlin. He emerged with 197,000 votes, or 40.3 per cent, against 162,000
(33.2 per cent) for Mr Schroder and nearly 130,000 (26.5 per cent) for Ms
Wieczoreck-Zeul.

Mr Yeltsin, who is expected to discuss aid for Russian economic reforms with

The trip next month follows the last-minute cancellation of a bilateral
visit last autumn and confusing signals about whether he planned a separate
visit after the summit.
It has also emerged that the shadowy security council, which last year took
the decision to cancel the presidential visit to Tokyo, is to be headed by
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, previously head of the Commonwealth of
Independent States' unified command.
The council is a committee of senior officials that deals with foreign and
some domestic affairs, in addition to security.
Mr Yeltsin said he had appointed the marshal without consulting other
commonwealth states because their plans to set up their own armies meant the
unified command no longer had 'much weight'. The marshal was chosen for his
military background and because Mr Yeltsin had 'absolute faith' in him,
unlike his predecessor, Mr Yuri Skokov, sacked for disloyalty.
Dealing with diplomacy closer to home, Mr Yeltsin said he would meet
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on Thursday to discuss problems of fuel
supplies to Ukraine and the row over the Black Sea Fleet. 'We had to turn
the tap off (energy supplies), then immediately there was this fuss over the
Black Sea Fleet,' he said. Moscow could not go on 'giving away energy' to
Ukrainian enterprises which were not paying their bills.

LORD Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, met
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva yesterday as part of renewed
diplomatic efforts to end the slaughter in the former Yugoslav republic,
agencies report.
The talks coincided with reports that Serb rockets flattened a temporary
hospital, killing more than 50 patients and medical staff, in the blockaded
east Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
The death toll, if independently confirmed, would be one of the worst in a
single incident in the 14-month war between Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serb
communities.
Officials of the Moslem-led Bosnian government said it had urged Mr
Izetbegovic to return home immediately from Geneva to underline the gravity
of the crisis in the enclave.
The talks, a day after the mediators met Croat leaders, focused on the
growing conflict between the Moslem-led government and its former Croat
allies.
Lord Owen said that one of the main aims of the talks was to alleviate
fighting between Moslems and Croats 'but the essential task is still the
overall peace settlement'.
Shortly after the discussions, Moslem, Croat and Serb members of Bosnia's
presidency gathered at the UN's European headquarters for a special session
to discuss temporary power-sharing arrangements.
Lord Owen wanted the presidency - comprising President Izetbegovic and two
other Moslem representatives, two Croats and two Serbs - to consider
delegating more authority to a so-called co-ordinating body as a prelude to
an interim government.
Late yesterday Sarajevo radio, monitored by the BBC, said the presidency had
ordered an immediate end to fighting between its forces and Croats.
The radio quoted the presidency order as saying: 'All conflicts between
units of the army of Bosnia-Hercegovina and the formations of the Croatian
defence council must stop immediately.' It added that Moslem-led government
army commander Rasim Delic and Bosnian Croat army chief Milivoj Petkovic
would be responsible for implementing the truce.
UN commanders called a meeting of Serb, Croat and Moslem army chiefs to take
place at Sarajevo airport tomorrow to discuss a lasting ceasefire.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg hope to gather leaders of all the Bosnian
factions, as well as Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman, for talks in Geneva on Wednesday.
From the battlefront, Sarajevo's Moslem-controlled radio said there were no
survivors of the direct hit on the temporary hospital building in Gorazde
and added: 'Pieces of human bodies are mixed with cement, broken boards,
bricks and mortar.'
Fifteen people were reported killed yesterday before the hospital was hit.
About 60,000 inhabitants and refugees are trapped in Gorazde, which Serbs
are attacking in defiance of its designation as a UN safe area.
Meanwhile, Sarajevo had one of its worst bouts of shelling in weeks as
gunners around the city ignored a warning by the commander of UN troops in
Bosnia that the country was sliding towards anarchy.
On Saturday General Philippe Morillon threatened to pull out the
9,000-strong UN Protection Force under his command if local political and
military leaders did not commit themselves firmly to the faltering peace
process.

THE US is to sell helicopters to Turkey and transfer 50 A-10 tank buster
aircraft in a Dollars 356m (Pounds 231.1m) package unveiled in Ankara over
the weekend by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state (pictured left
with his Turkish counterpart, Mr Hikmet Cetin). The deal, which includes the
purchase of five Super-Cobra attack helicopters, gets around a US
congressional move last year to cut US military aid to Turkey and Greece and
Portugal, other southern flank Nato members, under which grants were changed
to credits, writes John Murray Brown.
Until this year Turkey was the third largest recipient of US military aid
after Israel and Egypt, receiving about Dollars 500m annually under the US
foreign military sales programme, most of which was used in Turkey's F-16
fighter aircraft manufacturing project.
Mr Christopher said the Clinton administration would seek congressional
approval for the latest sales.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Italian bank reform set to spur privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S banks have been given the go-ahead to take stakes in industrial
companies, in a step aimed at assisting privatisation and bailing out
troubled private companies.
Commercial banks will be able to own up to 15 per cent of industrial
companies directly, provided the stakes do not damage their profits. The
size and number of equity stakes will be limited by criteria set by the Bank
of Italy, based on a commercial bank's size and type of business.
Large commercial banks will not be able to invest more than 6 per cent of
their capital in a single stake, and not more than 40 per cent for all their
industrial participations.
The plan to reform one of the central pillars of Italy's 1936 banking law,
made by the central bank last month and approved by a cabinet committee on
Friday night, takes the country's banking rules closer to the German model.
The long-discussed change has been accelerated by the severe debt crisis
faced by a number of Italian companies. Rescue talks are under way between
Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, and bank creditors, while
creditors are negotiating a restructuring of the Aga Khan's Ciga hotels
chain. Ferruzzi and Ciga have debts of L31,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) and well
over L1,000bn respectively.
Reform of banking rules could also ease the government's privatisation
plans. Allowing the banks to take stakes in privatised companies could help
overcome liquidity problems on the small Milan stock exchange and provide
the government with much-needed cash to curb the huge budget deficit.
Italy's privatisation programme, involving the disposal or flotation of
large swathes of the state's activities in industry, energy and financial
services, has had a slow start. Although handicapped by domestic political
uncertainties, disposals have also been held back by limited interest.
Some observers fear reform of the banking law could put pressure on
state-owned banks, which dominate the financial system, to buy up privatised
assets. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, said the change was 'a
question of force majeure' in the current economic climate.
A senior Italian official has confirmed the government has reached a
compromise with the European Commission on reforming new laws on securities
trading to bring them into line with EC rules.
This follows a Commission threat to bring Italy before the European Court of
Justice over rules forcing foreign stockbrokers and securities houses to set
up trading activities in the country.
Rome will alter its controversial law, named after the Societa di
Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new form of securities broker, to conform
with EC rules on freedom of establishment and the free provision of
services. 'Effectively, Italy will anticipate the EC directive on investment
services,' the official said.

<TEXT>
MR Geidar Aliyev, former Communist party boss in Azerbaijan, was set
yesterday to sweep back into power on the coat-tails of nationalist
democracy's failings, writes Leyla Boulton.
The protege of former Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev was offered the
powerful post of parliamentary chairman after Mr Isa Gambarov, one of the
leaders of the anti-Communist Popular Front, said he was resigning for the
sake of 'civic accord'.
Mr Aliyev, 70, was invited back to the capital Baku after an uprising
launched by one of his supporters in Gyandzha, Azerbaijan's second largest
city. The leader of the insurrection, Mr Suret Guseinov, who is holding
government officials hostage, has called for the resignation of President
Abulfaz Elchibey, who sacked him from his military command in the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan switches fully to its own currency - the manat -
tomorrow, according to a presidential decree.

Mr Behnke said the FDA had not advised it to recall its products, but it had

A Moslem extremist convicted of terrorist attacks and trying to overthrow

militants sentenced to death by military courts, AP reports from Cairo.
An Egyptian convicted of spying for Israel was also hanged, said a military
official who declined to be further identified.
Last year, President Hosni Mubarak started referring Moslem extremists to
military courts to ensure speedy trials. The government has been involved in
a violent confrontation with the radicals who want to turn Egypt into an
Iranian-type theocracy. Over 150 people have been killed since 1992.

Israel's cabinet yesterday approved plans to establish a private sector free
trade zone to stimulate foreign investment and create jobs, Julian Ozanne
writes from Jerusalem. Investors in the zone, to be sited either in the
Galilee or the Negev desert, will be granted a 20-year income tax holiday
and indefinite exemption from customs duties and import-taxes.
Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, promised that the free trade zone, the
country's first, will create thousands of jobs for an economy with an
unemployment rate of 10.6 per cent.
The finance minister also said yesterday that the scheme was designed
particularly to attract US and other foreign companies which have complained
about excessive bureaucratic red-tape for new foreign investors in Israel.

They said the Briton, Simon Dunn, 23, and the German, Kai Sondermann, were

foreigners charged with similar offences are serving their sentences. The
two men were arrested at gun-point on
May 28 and had been sentenced to eight years in jail on

Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris.
Despite opposition from hardliners in the Socialist opposition and from
Gaullist nationalists within the centre-right coalition government, the
National Assembly voted to accept the proposed reforms by an overwhelming
majority.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, will on Wednesday present the final
proposals for the new Bank of France legislation to the council of

FT  14 JUN 93 / US, Japan still split on trade
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO days of talks between the US and Japan, which ended in Washington on
Saturday, failed to narrow the gap between the two sides on a framework for
bilateral trade negotiations and in particular on how Japan's huge trade
surplus might be reduced.
The talks were the first round of formal exchanges between US and Japanese
officials aimed at formulating a framework for negotiating economic and
trade issues, which was agreed between President Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in April.
The inconclusive nature of the talks leaves the possibility of further
uncertainty on the foreign exchange market where US unhappiness with Japan's
surplus and the lack of a clear Japanese strategy for reducing it have led
to the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Although details
have not been revealed, on the first day of talks the US is believed to have
urged Japan to accept its proposal to set a target of reducing its current
account surplus to within 1-2 per cent of GDP development and increase the
ratio of imports to GDP.
Japanese officials, however, are expected to have rejected that on the
grounds that the surplus and its import ratio are both the result of
economic activity over which they do not, as members of a free market
economy, have control.
The US and Japan are committed to agreeing ground rules and procedures for
the talks before the Group of Seven summit early next month. However, the
two sides are still far apart on their views of what lies behind Japan's
high trade surplus.
The US believes the closed nature of Japan's markets is a main reason for
the surplus and would like to set measurable indicators of progress to
ensure that Japan opens its markets to imports.
Japan, on the other hand, insists that it has one of the most open markets
in the world and emphasises the imbalances of investment and savings in the
two countries as being a big factor behind its surplus. It believes more
long-term measures are needed on both sides to reduce its surplus with the
rest of the world.
On the second day of the talks, the US and Japan were, however, able to
agree on global co-operation in issues such as environmental protection and
technology transfer.
The talks are expected to resume in Tokyo in the last week of this month.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Exaggerated rumours of inflation's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS inflation a thing of the past? 'Yes' is the answer given by contemporary
conventional wisdom. This sounds too good to be true. It probably is.
Indices of consumer prices suggest that the purchasing power of a 1933 pound
had fallen to a mere 3p by 1993, while that of the dollar had declined to 9
cents. Ever since the Great Depression, money has been the creature of the
state, which has discharged this responsibility with outstanding
incompetence.
People go to jail for using fraudulent weights and measures. Governments try
to get elected for doing the same thing to money. The reason they do so is
that many voters benefit from the fraud. Unanticipated inflation creates
unearned wealth and undeserved poverty. Politicians who could not get away
with voting for the implied transfers of income and wealth hope to do the
same thing by stealth.
Inflation achieves these effects only when unanticipated. But a steady rate
of inflation can hardly remain unanticipated forever. That is the main
reason why the inflation of the 1950s and 1960s exploded in the 1970s. Since
the 1940 price level was below that in 1918 for both the US and the UK, it
is not surprising that society took time to adapt to rising prices. By 1970,
however, it had. In the meantime, society itself changed. Once it had a
middle class of rentiers. Now it has one of barely abashed property
speculators.
Inflation peaked in the 1970s. Although it has been far lower in the 1980s,
it has still not ceased. Yet, given the difficulty of measuring quality
improvement, it may not be all that far from the definition advanced by Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. 'Price stability,' he
argued, 'means that expected changes in the average price level are small
enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and
household decisions'.
Yet how optimistic should one be about the future? Some argue that
competition from new suppliers will keep prices down. But this confuses
changes in particular relative prices with changes in the overall price
level. Others point to the low growth of credit and broad money everywhere
that matters, except, amazingly, in Germany. This is a better argument, but
sooner or later banks will have restored their capital base and borrowers
will have regained their courage, even though this may take several more
years.
A more cogent argument for optimism is that the benefits of inflation to
policymakers are now small, its victims are better able to protect
themselves and its beneficiaries are also politically weaker. Pensioners,
for example, are too important a lobby to ignore. Meanwhile, potential
victims either lend short or demand high long-term nominal interest rates in
relation to current inflation. Policymakers know they are permanently on
trial and, lacking exchange controls, face immediate penalties if they are
condemned.
Nevertheless, there are also four good reasons for fearing that high
inflation might be back one day. First, managed money has never delivered
stable prices, or even stable low inflation, over a long period. Second,
each year of relatively modest inflation lulls the public further, thereby
increasing the redistributive effects of another burst of inflation. Third,
there are plenty of debtors around who would adore higher prices. Finally,
amongst those debtors are almost all major governments, whose accounts are
bleeding red ink. The abolition of exchange controls may make it costly for
a country to choose inflation on its own. But there is always the
alternative of global inflation, no doubt euphemistically labelled
'concerted reflation'. Buyers of long-dated conventional bonds, remember and
beware.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Hitch for Clinton's court plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON'S newest and most virulent disease - acquired household help
payments deficiency syndrome - was yesterday presenting complications for
President Bill Clinton's likely choice for the Supreme Court.
The White House confirmed US media reports that Judge Stephen Breyer of
Massachusetts and his wife had for several years failed to make social
security payments on an elderly woman who was a part- time help in their
home.
They had apparently made back payments and paid a penalty earlier this year
following revelations in the cases of Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimba Wood,
respectively nominated and considered by Mr Clinton for the position of
attorney general.
The president was said to have been impressed by Judge Breyer, chief of the
federal appeals bench on the Boston circuit, at a White House lunch on
Friday. No announcement was then made to allow for last-minute background
checks, but the Breyers were asked to stay on in the Washington area for a
few days and the other leading candidate, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior
secretary, said he was content in his present position.
There was no early word yesterday from the White House as to whether Judge
Breyer's nomination was now in doubt. But one obvious problem, instantly
alluded to by Mr William Cohen, the Republican senator from Maine, is that
nominating him could prompt the widespread perception that a double standard
is applied to male and female candidates for high office.
During the Baird and Wood controversies, it was frequently alleged that no
male nominee would ever have been subjected to inquiry about the affairs of
his personal household. Two male cabinet members - Mr Ron Brown at the
Commerce Department and Mr Federico Pena at transportation  - were confirmed
in office after disclosing that they had failed to pay the relevant taxes on
their domestic employment.
Women's groups are also upset that Mr Clinton dropped Ms Lani Guinier's
nomination to the justice department civil rights division.
There are shades of difference in the three household help cases. Ms Baird
and her husband, a law professor at Yale, had hired a Peruvian couple,
apparently knowing that it was illegal at the time to hire undocumented
immigrants. Judge Wood and her husband, a journalist at Time magazine,
committed no technical breach of the law - their recruitment of an illegal
alien occured when there was no proscription against such hiring - but were
caught in the Baird backlash.
Judge Breyer and his wife, a psychologist, are said not to have paid social
security payments which they thought unnecessary because their household
help, a US citizen, was already old enough to be receiving social security
benefits.
Current US law requires the employer of casual labour, such as nannies and
babysitters, to pay social security taxes whenever a sum of more than
Dollars 50 (Pounds 32) a quarter is involved.
This income threshold is considered ridiculously low, leading to widespread
evasion, and changes are now in front of Congress.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Business pins hopes on breakthrough in Gatt: Apple chief
puts stress on market access deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG business in the US is worried about President Clinton's slide in
popularity but is pinning its hopes of a revival on a breakthrough in the
Gatt world trade talks next month, according to Mr John Sculley, chairman
and chief executive of Apple Computer.
Mr Sculley said an agreement on market access between the US, Japan, Canada
and the EC at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo would give an
important psychological stimulus to the world economy, strengthening Mr
Clinton's chances of securing congressional support for his tax package.
A confidant of Mr Clinton, Mr Sculley added these two successes would leave
the president able to take on ratification of the North American Free Trade
Agreement with Mexico and Canada: 'Then you will see his popularity
increasing dramatically in September and October.'
Mr Sculley offered his assessment of the US and European political scene
during a wide-ranging interview last week in Brussels, where he was
attending a meeting of the Transatlantic Policy Network, a new group of
industrialists and parliamentarians dedicated to improving transatlantic
relations.
In the interview, Mr Sculley described Mr Jacques Delors, President of the
European Commission, as a 'true visionary' in his drive to create the
European single market. Now he was the ideal figure to carry a new message:
that the EC had to move from the 'old economy' to a new, high skills,
information intensive economy dependent on increasing productivity.
Higher productivity did not mean fewer jobs, he said. Rather the aim should
be to raise productivity through economic expansion by means of greater
market access.
Mr Sculley was equivocal about the EC's plans for a single currency.
He criticised high German interest rates as 'a misplaced policy', adding
that it was 'unfortunate that all of Europe is having to pay for the
assimilation of East Germany into West Germany'.
On trade matters, Mr Sculley drew a distinction between Japan and the EC,
noting that the US-European relationship had largely been trouble-free in
the context of the overall trade balance.
On Japan, Mr Sculley strongly defended the administration's tough approach.
Although he rejected the term 'managed trade', he suggested that some
numerical measure of market access was justified.
'However you get there, the US can't go on year after year with a huge
bilateral imbalance between us and Japan.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / EC aims to head off Bonn dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is counting on quiet diplomacy to head off a
damaging dispute with Germany after disclosure of a secret non-aggression
pact on telecommunications between the Bonn government and the US.
EC officials believe the bilateral understanding forswearing trade sanctions
was struck by the economics ministry without the knowledge of the German
foreign ministry.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, has asked
Bonn for an explanation and Brussels officials yesterday described the
German move as a direct challenge to the single European market and said it
could jeopardise EC unity in the Gatt trade talks. 'If the German government
sticks to its position, it is a very serious matter,' said a senior EC
official, referring to the political damage ahead of next week's EC summit
in Copenhagen.
The understanding on telecommunications and other service industries was
reached between Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics minister, and Mr Mickey
Kantor, US Trade Representative, apparently in the margins of this month's
annual meeting of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.
Mr Rexrodt indicated that Germany would not pass into law Article 29 of the
EC's Utilities Directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference for EC
companies.
Mr Rexrodt also pledged not to apply discriminatory trade sanctions against
the US which earlier imposed a ban on bids from EC companies for Dollars 19m
(Pounds 12.3m) worth of public procurement contracts, in protest against
Article 29's restrictive provisions.
The German move challenges the decision by 12 EC foreign ministers to impose
a Dollars 15m sanctions package in retaliation against the US on June 8 in
Luxembourg. It seems to contravene the Rome Treaty which awards sole
competence in trade policy to the European Commission.
Last Friday, the German Economics Ministry defended its moves, declaring
that Germany was bound by a 1954 friendship treaty with the US which forbids
trade discrimination. It also insisted that the Utilities Directive was
drafted deliberately loosely, so that the EC 'may apply Community
preference' and that any agreement was 'not withstanding existing
commitments to third countries'.
EC officials hope that Mr Rexrodt will come under pressure from colleagues,
nervous about the political reaction.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government successfully staged elections for a civilian
president on Saturday, after three delays in the last three years, but
turnout was low. Results are unlikely to be announced until tomorrow at the
earliest.
Among those who did not cast a vote were Mr Bashir Tofa, the presidential
candidate for the right-of-centre National Republican Convention (NRC), and
his vice-presidential running mate, Mr Sylvester Ugoh. Mr Tofa arrived late
at his local polling booth in the northern city of Kano, and found that his
voter's registration card was out of date.
Under Nigerian law, a candidate is barred from winning the presidency if he
is not registered to vote in these polls, but the National Electoral
Commission has already cleared both parties' candidates to stand for
election.
Mr Tofa's rival, Mr Moshood Abiola, had no such problems at his polling
station, which is in Moshood Abiola Crescent in Lagos, but the turnout, even
in such partisan territory, was about a third of the number registered to
vote.
Of the 38m who are registered, disillusionment with the choice of candidates
and the rigid voting schedule helped to keep voters away even in the urban
areas where there were shorter travelling distances.
Everyone had to be at their polling station by 8am to be accredited and to
remain after voting until about midday when the ballot papers were counted.
Polling passed off smoothly in most parts of the country. The agents of both
parties were able to check the count at each level. One of the foreign
observers at these elections will be at the electoral commission
headquarters to watch the final count.

<DATELINE>
   BLANTYRE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIFE presidency of one of the world's most durable absolute rulers goes
on the line today when Malawi votes on western-style democracy, Reuter
reports from Blantyre.
Dr Kamuzu Hastings Banda has run the tiny southern African nation like a
private estate since independence from Britain in 1964. But he has been
forced by internal unrest and western pressure over abuses of power to hold
a referendum on whether Malawi remains a one-party state or permits
opposition parties.
The nonagenarian Ngwazi (conqueror) - officially he is 87 but is widely
believed to be around 95 - predicts the roughly 4m voters will endorse his
paternal autocracy.
An opposition alliance is equally confident that Malawians have woken up
from years of oppression to a new dawn of democracy creeping over Africa.
Whatever happens, diplomats say it is unlikely Dr Banda's old style of
government, which critics say brooks no opposition on pain of detention or
even death, can survive.
Western donors who keep the nation afloat are withholding all except
humanitarian assistance in protest against human rights violations.
Malawians have shown unprecedented resistance to the ruling Malawi Congress
Party (MCP) - rioting a year ago killed about 40 people.
Even the old president has appeared to acknowledge he cannot go on as
before. At one rally he conceded there was more than one side to debate.
The Alliance for Democracy (Aford) is campaigning for a multi-party vote
with the United Democratic Front (UDF) led by Mr Bakili Muluzi, a sacked
former minister .
In event of a victory, the opposition wants a national unity government set
up within a week to draw up a democratic constitution and a bill of rights.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Cambodia losers go back on their word: The ruling communists
have refused to accept election results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the United Nations fails in its Dollars 2bn mission to bring peace and
democracy to Cambodia, much of the blame will be laid at the door of the
Cambodian politicians who did the opposite of what they said they were going
to.
The opening in Phnom Penh today of the Cambodian assembly, elected in
UN-organised polls last month and charged with creating a new constitution
and forming a government, is overshadowed by continuing violence and threats
of secession from the existing communist administration.
'We consider ourselves sports,' Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, had said
before the election. 'We are prepared to transfer everything to the winner.'
But when his Cambodian People's party (CPP) won only 51 seats in the
120-member assembly, against 58 for the royalist opposition party Funcinpec,
he changed his tune, claiming 'massive irregularities' in the election and
refusing to recognise the results or hand over power.
Over the weekend the CPP has condoned the formation of an 'autonomous zone'
of seven eastern provinces. CPP-organised demonstrators have threatened UN
workers and Funcinpec officials and forced the UN and Funcinpec to evacuate
their civilian staff from several provincial towns.
The secessionist movement, designed to press the UN and Funcinpec into
meeting CPP demands, is led by senior CPP officials and has been greeted
with little enthusiasm by the public.
Other factions have also performed political somersaults in response to
Funcinpec's success.
The extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge, which withdrew from the peace process and
attacked the election as a 'cheating and dirty' means of legitimising the
Vietnamese-installed CPP government, is now loftily demanding in the name of
democracy that the CPP yield to Funcinpec - once a Khmer Rouge ally.
Funcinpec itself, having promised to hand executive power to the erratic
elder statesman Prince Norodom Sihanouk if he won the election, was appalled
when he seized the initiative and attempted to form an interim government
that gave the CPP equal weight with Funcinpec.
Prince Ranariddh, Funcinpec leader and son of Prince Sihanouk, yesterday
condemned the CPP secessionists as 'renegades', demanded that the CPP
recognise the election results and raised the spectre of a renewed outbreak
of civil war.
'We are ready to set up our own forces to fight and liberate that part of
Cambodia, and I hope we will be supported by the world community,' he said.
'We do have arms, weapons caches in those provinces.'
In fact Funcinpec is almost finished as a military force, and Prince
Ranariddh's other threat is likely to carry more weight. 'I will travel
around the world,' he said, 'to explain the real situation of Cambodia and
ask them to clearly condemn the CPP and to freeze any aid and any support to
those who are acting against the will of the Cambodian people.'
Despite the animosity between the two largest parties in the assembly, the
western and Asian backers of the 1991 Cambodian peace plan believe that
stability will be best served by a Funcinpec-CPP coalition, if only because
the CPP has the only credible Cambodian military force apart from the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
CPP support will also be needed for the passing of a new constitution in the
assembly by a two thirds majority. UN officials and western diplomats are
hoping that at least some CPP leaders, particularly in the armed forces,
will refuse to risk further international isolation by defying the UN.
Cambodia and its communist administration are broke, and soldiers are often
paid months late. One of the few bargaining chips held by the UN
Transitional Authority is its plan to pay soldiers and civil servants some
Dollars 5m to Dollars 7m a month until a recognised government is formed.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Chinese peasants riot over tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING dissatisfaction among China's 800m peasants has spilled over into
persistent and angry clashes with officials, including riots in Sichuan, the
country's most populous province.
Provincial officials confirmed that crowds of peasants had earlier this
month besieged government headquarters in Renshou county, 80km south of
Chengdu, the provincial capital, to protest over increases in taxes and
charges to fund a local highway.
Peasants are reported to have rampaged around the town, blocking traffic,
assaulting officials and attacking vehicles. The disturbances took place
between June 3 and 6.
Police used teargas to break up angry mobs whose numbers are said to have
ranged between a few hundred and as many as 10,000. A provincial government
official in Chengdu confirmed that a riot had taken place, but he was
reluctant to go into detail.
Western officials, who visited Renshou in the past few days, said they had
noted evidence of trouble, including slogans daubed on walls denouncing
local officials, but felt reports of mass disturbances were exaggerated.
The troubles in Sichuan are by no means an isolated incident, however. They
demonstrate widespread dissatisfaction among China's peasant farmers who are
being left behind in the country's economic boom as the gap widens between
city and country.
Official statistics show that average per capita peasant annual income
stands at Yn770 (Pounds 90) . This represents less than half the average of
urban dwellers.
Stories abound of clashes between mutinous peasants and the authorities.
Among recent episodes are disruptions caused to rail traffic in central
Henan province after a dispute over requisition land for rail crossings and
protests in southern Guangdong province over compensation for land seized by
the state.
Hard-pressed peasants have also been assailing tax collectors, sometimes
violently. The new militancy among peasants, dismayed at their inability to
share the fruits of China's economic boom, may well prove the government's
most serious challenge in years.
China's leaders have, belatedly, recognised the dangers. Mr Qiao Shi, a
member of the politburo's ruling seven-member standing committee, recently
visited Sichuan to urge better treatment of peasants by local officials, who
are being blamed for corruption and for extorting excessive charges and
levies.
China's official media has been full of exhortations to officials to be more
sensitive to the plight of the peasants. The central authorities have been
releasing funds to redeem IOUs to farmers for grain acquired compulsorily by
the state. Failure to honor these commitments has proved a principal cause
of unrest.
The Public Security Ministry has also issued an order to police to stop
harassing peasants and imposing arbitrary fines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRANIAN President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani won a second four-year term
yesterday with a reduced vote that underlined the waning popularity of the
country's Islamic revolution, Reuter reports from Tehran.
But Mr Rafsanjani saw the result as a vote of confidence in his economic
reform plans. 'That a considerable majority of people supported the
programme is a great asset for me and my colleagues that would encourage us
to execute the rest of the programme with confidence,' he said in a message
broadcast on radio and television.
Diplomats described the result and the low turnout as a near-humiliation
which could severely limit the president's authority.
Final results of Friday's poll, announced yesterday, gave the 58-year-old
cleric 10.6m votes, or 63.2 per cent of the vote, compared with 94.5 per
cent in the 1989 election.
The turnout was 57.6 per cent, showing that economic hardship made many
voters indifferent to calls from the ruling clergy for a mass display of
faith in the 1979 revolution.
It meant that Mr Rafsanjani, running against three no-hope challengers, won
endorsement from fewer that 11m of the 29m Iranians eligible to vote.
The big surprise was Mr Ahmad Tavakkoli, a former labour minister who now
edits the economic section of Tehran's right-wing daily Resalat. His
campaign attacks on economic mismanagement captured 23.8 per cent of the
votes.
Diplomats said the weakened Mr Rafsanjani may now be more reluctant to push
through with efforts to curb radicals who continue to foment militancy at
home and abroad.

FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Germany's AEG sets its sights
on vast railways potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are about 30 cities in China with more than 1m inhabitants; several
forming the focus of conurbations which are home to up to 15m people. Only
two and a bit - Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai - have an underground railway.
Mr Klaus Oertel, the board member responsible for AEG's fast-growing rail
systems division, does not even attempt a guess at the sales potential. He
focuses instead on the steady devolution of centralised decision-making
powers to regional and city authorities which is slowly opening China's
infrastructure market to outside expertise and investment.
Four years after leading a German consortium into the fledgling Shanghai
metro network with a DM350m (Dollars 218m) start-up order for 96 underground
carriages, power supply, overhead line and telecommunications equipment, the
Daimler-Benz subsidiary is on the verge of making its first direct
investment in Chinese railways.
This month, during the opening of the first stretch of Metro Shanghai, Mr
Oertel signed a letter of intent to take a majority stake in a joint venture
to make trains in China with the Shanghai Crane and Conveyor Works. With a
stake of less than DM10m, and planned start-up capacity of one carriage a
week, the deal is a tiny step along what may prove to be a permanent way
leading to an infrastructural Eldorado.
Like most German companies, AEG has been relatively slow and cautious in its
entry into China. But Mr Oertel disputes claims from the likes of Mr
Hans-Joachim von Ludwig, a director of Alcatel SEL, a Franco-German
telecommunications consortium, that Germany 'seems to have lost track of the
opportunities'.
According to Mr von Ludwig, only 3 per cent of all German foreign direct
investment last year was made in Asia, compared with Japan's 38 per cent.
Mr Oertel accepts that Germany, occupied with a European and domestic boom
for most of the 1980s, was late to join the 'travelling circus' search for
low-wage manufacturing bases.
But AEG is now more concerned with the future. So far Shanghai has opened
only one 14km stretch of metro track in a planned network of 180km which, Mr
Oertel says, will require about 1,000 carriages over 15 to 20 years.
Meanwhile, the company is discussing a further joint venture with Changchun
Railcar Works, the country's biggest rolling stock maker, and is in talks at
central government level in Beijing on the prospects of deals in the
locomotive industry.
AEG's plans, set up in-house by a group led by chairman Mr Georg Stockl, are
part of a grand group design, overseen in Daimler's Stuttgart headquarters.
In a surge of activity, focused on what one Daimler official calls a 'state'
visit by Mr Gerhard Liener, the finance director, Daimler group companies
have this year already signed or finished negotiating more than half a dozen
projects in China. Mr Liener recently capped the package with an
announcement that Germany's biggest industrial concern will grace Shanghai's
infant stock exchange by listing its shares there. This move, of more
political than commercial importance, followed a flurry of successful
diplomatic efforts by the Bonn government to further German interests in
China.
AEG's Mr Oertel, too, has his own diplomatic contacts. Mr Zhu Rongji, a
former mayor of Shanghai, was instrumental in the 1989 deal under which AEG
and consortium partners Siemens and ABB won the main contracts for the first
stretch of the city's underground. Mr Zhu is now a first vice premier of the
state council in Beijing.
But according to Mr Oertel, the main factor qualifying AEG to win Chinese
contracts is the quality and depth of its expertise in local rail transport.
Another crucial element is the size and resources of its supporting parent.
While Mr Oertel says he is not at all concerned about the possibility of
damaging political upheaval in China, he acknowledges the risks inherent in
investing in fast growing and febrile economies. 'Anyone going into a
developing market must be clear that while in the long run everything will
work out, in the short-term someone has to pay the water bills.'

FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Emigrant entrepreneurs seize
new opportunities back home

<TEXT>
IN September 1893 the imperial authorities in China issued an edict
encouraging successful Chinese emigrants to invest in their homeland. The
edict proclaimed that the overseas Chinese would in future be welcomed back
to China - a reversal of previous policy which had not recognised those who
had left China's shores.
Now, 100 years on, China is once again wooing the overseas Chinese to
participate in developments at home. And the Chinese diaspora, many of whom
are removed from China by several generations, are responding.
While investment in China by US, Japanese and EC interests has been
increasing substantially, it is the financial resources of the overseas
Chinese which are now beginning to transform many parts of China.
Just how much of China's foreign investment is accounted for by overseas
Chinese is hard to gauge. But its influence is plain to see.
Guangdong province in the south has been transformed by capital flowing in
from nearby Hong Kong. Businessmen from Taipei are overrunning Fujian, the
mainland province just across the water from Taiwan. The vast resources of
the overseas Shanghainese - some of them the entrepreneurs primarily
responsible for the emergence of Hong Kong in the 1950s and 1960s - are now
returning home.
Traditionally the overseas Chinese have always been great savers. Taiwan,
with 21m people, has foreign exchange reserves of nearly Dollars 90bn.
Singapore, three quarters of whose 2.8m people are Chinese, has reserves of
more than Dollars 40bn.
The Chinese dominate the economies of south-east Asian countries. In
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines it is the Chinese - though
often only a small minority - who control trade and run the biggest
companies.
Mr Liem Sioe Liong, an Indonesian Chinese, runs the Salim group, believed to
be the biggest in the region with an estimated annual turnover of Dollars
8bn.
Mr Liem, who left China as a penniless teenager, is now investing millions
in China, much of it in property in areas round his birthplace in Fujian
province.
Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, has a business empire mainly involved
in commodities and hotels. Mr Kuok is investing in building hotels and
commodity processing facilities in various parts of China.
Chinese businesses are traditionally family-run, secretive enterprises. A
web of Chinese family concerns stretches throughout east Asia and,
increasingly, into China.
For the most part the overseas Chinese avoid China's cumbersome bureaucracy:
in many cases they strike informal deals with local groups, often based on
family connections.
For some there is a strong emotional attachment to the homeland. But most
investments are made for hard-headed commercial reasons. They, like so many
others, are intent on making the most of the opportunities available in such
a vast market.

FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Many chins make light work of
razor sales targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR Gillette, the Boston-based razor manufacturer, China has switched from
being a possibility to a reality in three years.
The groundwork was laid in the early 1980s. The US company entered mainland
China ten years ago, via a small 50:50 joint venture, called Shenmei Daily
Use Products. This operation was negotiated with the Chinese authorities in
Liaoning province, to the north-east of Beijing.
It comprised an existing plant in Shenyang, which - with expertise from its
US partner - has produced double-edge blades and razors under the Rhino
brand name for a decade.
Gillette says the venture has been consistently profitable, and 'sells
everything we can make'. But it remains small: annual production is around
60m units, in a market which absorbs 1bn units a year.
Mr Gaston Levy, head of Gillette's international group, says the northern
location is not ideal. 'It became a regional issue, but, as a pilot project,
Shenmei did allow us to understand the Chinese mentality.'
So, in about 1988, Gillette began to look at central and southern regions.
The crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989
caused the group to put plans on hold, but then it began talking to the
authorities about setting up a joint venture with China's leading blade
manufacturer in Shanghai.
Negotiations, spanning layers of officialdom, took two years. Mr Levy
remembers that his counterparts insisted on talking only after dinner.
Typically, the Chinese would then retire, to discuss their bargaining
position, in the early hours. When they returned, the US side would also
politely bow, hold its own caucus, and respond. By three or four o'clock, a
negotiating point might be resolved. This laborious process was, he thinks,
an indication of the Chinese distrust of foreigners: 'They're very, very
careful - caution is much greater than anywhere else in the world.'
But, last August, Gillette had a deal. A joint venture with the Shanghai
Razor Blade Factory was agreed, setting up a new company called Gillette
Shanghai. Gillette obtained a 70 per cent share in the business and
management control, while the Chinese retained 30 per cent. All of
Shanghai's plant was taken over by the new company, and the joint venture
agreement called for 'first phase' capital investment of Dollars 60m.
Gillette would find Dollars 45m.
Today, about two-thirds of this money has been invested and the operation
employs more than 1,000 people. Gillette, meanwhile, has seven expatriates -
some of Chinese origin - working there. The business, says Mr Levy, is
profitable.
The deal took Gillette's share of the domestic blade market from about 10
per cent to over 70 per cent. Mr Levy admits that China is not the most
compelling of markets in terms of 'shaving usage'. The former Soviet
republics, for example, have a much higher 'shaving frequency' and
associated blade demand.
But China's appeal is partly its sheer size - a population of 1.1bn means a
lot of blade sales, even if shaving is not ubiquitous - and partly the
potential it offers for pushing more advanced products.
At present, basic blades sell for the equivalent of three US cents. By
nudging consumers towards more sophisticated shaving products, Gillette sees
scope for initially doubling this, and eventually raising it five or
six-fold. Already, the Shanghai plant is being geared up for production of
disposable razors.
Mr Levy does not make light of the problems. Language is an obvious one,
causing the US company to station interpreters on site. Marketing is
another. The joint venture is required to supply the Chinese government with
a minimum number of blades for export, but can then sell its remaining
output as it wishes. The operation had previously depended on the government
purchasing network, but Gillette is trying to develop its own wholesale
distribution system. Outside of the Shanghai area, says Mr Levy, this is
still a tough task.
The much-feared overheating of the Chinese economy is a background concern.
'Inflation would worry us,' says Mr Levy, noting that it has reached
double-digit figures in some areas.
Against these negative factors, there is the relative flexibility which the
Chinese system offers, and the deep-rooted commercialism of its people.
Gillette is free to remit profits if it wishes, and to choose how products
are marketed and sold. Meanwhile, the much-vaunted 'trading mentality', in
Mr Levy's eyes, differentiates China hugely from parts of eastern Europe.
Certainly, Gillette's commitment to China seems to be increasing. The
company is now edging into the toothbrush business.
Last month it set up a small joint venture plant in Shanghai, employing
under 100 people and producing Oral-B toothbrushes - both for sale in the
Chinese domestic market and for export. Again, China does not look the most
promising of markets: there is reckoned to be one dentist for every 77,000
people, and the 'average' Chinese buys one toothbrush every four years. But
the market is huge, and the government is anxious to improve healthcare.
Demand for better-quality dental products, Gillette argues, can only
increase.

FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Careful planning key to
rewarding ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S remarkable progress may tempt unwary foreigners to believe they can
simply invest in a joint venture, sit back and wait for the profits to roll
in.
Not so. Joint ventures require enormous preparation and constant attention.
The Chinese economy has moved some way towards the market, but businesses
still need the right contacts to ensure success. Problems need to be worked
out through persistent negotiation.
Businessmen and lawyers with experience of China say that the rewards are
there, but they have to be earned. They offer these suggestions:
Identify what you want out of a joint venture, and try to anticipate what a
potential partner would want. You may have an eye on the domestic market,
but a Chinese company may be looking to export. Mr John Beyer, director of
the China-Britain Trade Group, says: 'Quite a lot of joint ventures have
fallen by the wayside because the two sides have not identified overlapping
aims.'
Find the right partner, whose most important qualification will be good
connections in relevant city, provincial and state bodies.
Mr Robbie Robertson, director of strategic relations for GPT, which has a
successful joint venture making PABX telephone systems in Shanghai, says:
'If a venture is not with the right people, it will not succeed.' A partner
provides access to a skill and labour base, as well as the local clout to
ensure that a venture receives materials for which state or municipal
authorities remain responsible.
Pick the right location. Though investment has poured into special economic
zones where set-up costs may be lower, the quality of infrastructure,
particularly for transport, will be more important in the longer run.
Get a good contract including a reasonable amount of detail. Mr Stuart
Valentine, a solicitor at Clifford Chance in Hong Kong, says this is
important even though Chinese and western views of a contract may differ.
The Chinese are likely to treat it as a framework for discussion in the
event of problems. 'You can't bang the table and say 'this is what the
contract says',' Mr Valentine says.
Resolve problems through negotiation. There is little point in pursuing a
claim through courts in China, and lawyers say they know of no case in which
a judgment in a foreign court or arbitration tribunal has been enforced in
China.
Use expert advice and the experience of others. For British businesses, the
China-Britain Trade Group runs seminars and plans a 'mobile workshop' in
China in the autumn as part of an investment mission.

FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Lure of the billion-buyer
market - With 1.1bn people, the world's biggest consumer market is eyed
increasingly seriously. Foreign investment doubled last year and is
projected to surge again this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR YE DISHENG, the lively vice-mayor of Tianjin and the man in charge of
attracting foreign investment to the north-east industrial city, had no
reservations about his mission in life.
Asked if he was concerned about problems of economic overheating, Mr Ye
observed: 'It's not nearly hot enough in Tianjin. We want more heat.'
While his words may cause a shudder among Beijing bureaucrats charged with
restraining China's runaway economy, they also neatly reflect sentiments
among Chinese provincial officials who see a rapid inflow of foreign
investment as bringing jobs, raising living standards and overcoming acute
infrastructural problems.
Mr Ye and his colleagues in China's coastal regions and in a handful of
inland industrial centres could hardly complain about new investment
contracted in 1992, which reached astonishing heights and confirmed China as
the main destination for new funds in the world's fastest growing region -
and as the recipient last year of about one quarter of funds invested in
developing countries worldwide.
According to official statistics, China signed agreements in 1992 involving
Dollars 68.5bn in foreign capital, two and a half times that for 1991.
Foreign funds actually flowing into China last year totalled Dollars 11bn,
more than double the year before, and the surge is continuing.
Figures this month from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations
(Moftec) showed that in the first quarter 17,500 projects involving foreign
capital - and worth nearly Dollars 25bn - were approved, up 320 per cent on
1992.
Western economists urge caution in assessing Chinese statistics, which are
invariably accompanied by highly optimistic official interpretation. For a
start, China often builds into the investment figures equity from the
Chinese side, thus giving an exaggerated impression of the size of the
capital inflow.
Also, some investment is of Chinese origin but has been routed through
offshore entities to take advantage of tax breaks.
Many so-called agreements are also little more than memorandums of
understanding that stand little chance of yielding projects on the ground.
An allied problem has been Chinese sluggishness in absorbing investment due
to bureaucratic blockages, infrastructure deficiencies and cultural and
political hesitancy. Between 1978, the first year of the economic 'open
door' policy, and 1991 China signed contracts worth Dollars 48bn, of which
less than half was actually invested.
But circumstances are changing, not only in go-go Guangdong province in the
south, but also in other cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and now even
staid, bureaucratic Beijing, all of which have joined the scramble for
investment funds. It is perhaps hard to believe that one man could have such
an effect in a country of 1.1bn people, but there is no doubt that a visit
to southern China early last year by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's supreme
leader, in which he urged swifter growth, employing the simple slogan 'Do it
faster', has galvanised a nation.
The 'emperor' spoke and officials rushed to do his bidding, culminating in a
frenzy of activity in the last quarter of 1992 in which more than Dollars
30bn of contracts were signed, equivalent to figures for the rest of an
extraordinary year.
Among the more amazing statistics regarding foreign investment to have
emerged from China's ever-grinding statistical mill recently were those
revealing that in 1992 alone 47,000 joint ventures, co-operative
enterprises, and wholly owned foreign ventures were established, exceeding
the total number of the previous 14 years.
In all, 100,000 enterprises with foreign involvement were registered by the
end of the first quarter this year, most of them small businesses such as
restaurants and hairdressing salons employing a handful of people each. Hong
Kong and Macao investors are behind the bulk of these smaller businesses.
But an emerging trend involves increased Japanese, Taiwanese, US, and South
Korean investment in larger-scale projects. Japanese companies, which had
proved reluctant in the 1980s to become involved in China, are now beginning
to make more substantial investments. Taiwanese and South Korean groups,
both late starters, are following suit.
By the end of 1992, Taiwanese businesses had signed contracts valued at
Dollars 8.5bn. Companies from South Korea, which form-alised relations with
China last August, had initialled agreements worth Dollars 616m, and much
more is in the pipeline.
'More large projects, whose average total investment stands at over scores
of millions of US dollars were set up in the first three months,' Mr Yang
Xiaogong, a spokesman for Moftec was quoted as saying this week by the
official China Daily.
Of the actual direct - as opposed to simply contractual - investment
recorded by Moftec of about Dollars 37bn to the end of 1992, Hong Kong and
Macao head the table with a little more than 50 per cent, or an investment
of Dollars 21.2bn, followed by Japan with Dollars 3.9bn, the US on Dollars
3.2bn, Taiwan Dollars 1.9bn and Germany Dollars 471m, to name the top five.
Big increases in contracted investment were also recorded by Singapore and
Thailand, a reflection of the growing involvement in China of wealthy
overseas Chinese in those countries. Interestingly, investment is also
beginning to trickle into China from Russia, eastern Europe and the Middle
East.
Among factors fuelling the investment surge, apart from a bout of 'China
fever' that appears to be sweeping the international business community, is
the relaxation of restrictions on investment in real estate. Overseas
Chinese-controlled companies, especially those based in Hong Kong, have been
pouring funds into real estate projects in the hope of capitalising on huge
projected demand for commercial and residential property.
In Shanghai, for example, the Municipal Investment Commission approved 750
new projects in the first three months of this year worth about Dollars
1.8bn. About half this new investment will be channelled into property.
Local investors have also plunged into property development throughout
China, especially in the southern regions like Guangdong and Fujian, in the
expectation of riding a speculative wave; some of these local property
developers may be in for a shock with the government squeezing credit to try
to calm an overheated economy.
Another factor driving the investment surge is China's embrace of
build-operate-transfer infrastructure projects such as those in the power
sector. Hong Kong investors such as Mr Gordon Wu of Hopewell Holdings have
been active in this area, no doubt encouraged by the bounty earned by early
investors in Hong Kong utilities such as China Light and Power.
The explosion of activity has contributed to an atmosphere in China somewhat
akin to that of a gold rush, with businessmen and their overseas Chinese
agents pouring in from all over the world, negotiating deals and signing
contracts with apparent abandon.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Third US strike on Mogadishu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US AIRCRAFT pounded targets in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, last night for
the third night in succession, in an effort to blast a local warlord into
submission.
The latest attacks by AC-130 gunships came hours after Pakistani troops
serving with the United Nations opened fire on a crowd protesting against
earlier air raids. Witnesses said at least 12 and possibly more than 20
people were shot dead, though Pakistan denied its troops were responsible
for any killings.
Journalists watching from a hotel roof in central Mogadishu said the
aircraft fire last night was again concentrated near the residence of Gen
Mohamed Farah Aideed, the defiant warlord who controls much of the capital.
Gen Aideed's gunmen are blamed for the killing of 23 Pakistani UN troops a
week ago. Those deaths prompted the UN to call for the arrest, trial and
punishment of the gunmen and, by implication, of Gen Aideed for inciting the
killings.
Pakistan denied that the shootings yesterday were to avenge the death of its
soldiers. It said troops returned fire after being attacked by an armed
Somali group and it suggested any deaths were due to crossfire between
Somali factions.
The US air raids and the actions of the Pakistani troops have stunned and
angered Gen Aideed's supporters in the capital.
The attacks have buried the UN's humanitarian mission in Somalia, as
Mogadishu has turned into a city besieged by a multinational occupation
army.
Tanks patrol the streets. Helicopters swoop down to disperse crowds.
Lorry-loads of detained men, women and children are being corralled at the
grounds of the former university, now a US military centre.
UN tanks rolled by and ignored pleas for help from the many wounded in
yesterday's shootings.
According to Reuter's news agency, the Pakistani denial of responsibility
was disputed by witnesses, including journalists, who saw Pakistanis shoot
into a crowd without warning from a sandbagged fortress.
Pakistani troops also opened fire on Saturday after a crowd threw stones.
Two Somalis were killed, including a woman who died at Benadir hospital,
where the injured were being operated on without anaesthetic on makeshift
tables swarming with flies.
The heavy-handedness of the Pakistani contingent - the largest in the UN
force in Somalia - has been a leading cause of tension and hostility against
the UN in the capital. Brigadier Ikram ul-Hasan, commander of the 4,000
Pakistani peacekeeping troops in the Somali capital, told a press conference
that he was investigating yesterday's incident.
'The simple fact is that gunmen use women and children as human shields,' he
said.
The brigadier said he did not think his troops were an inflammatory
presence. Nor did he think there had been a violation of the UN's rules of
engagement.
Other UN military spokesmen have refused to comment. But the French relief
agency Medecins sans Frontieres, one of the few still operating in the
capital, said the killings were monstrous. At the hospital, a doctor said he
was sickened by the turn of events: 'The UN has started another war in
Somalia. The people are tired of war. Even if they kill Aideed, there are
thousands of other Aideeds out there to take his place.' The air strikes
have been very precise to try to avoid civilian casualties. US Cobra
helicopters and slow-flying aircraft picked out three armament sites and Gen
Aideed's radio station during the first strike over Mogadishu on Saturday.
The bombers returned before dawn yesterday to destroy what the UN claimed
was a 'veritable fortress' containing weapons, ammunition and armoured
vehicles. It belonged to Mr Osman Ato, Gen Aideed's financier. The explosion
lit up the night in the blacked-out city.
Later, a building held by Pakistani peacekeepers came under heavy rocket
attack from Gen Aideed's gunmen. Reporters visiting the bombed site
yesterday saw no evidence of burned-out ammunition stockpiles.
Mr Ato claims he stored only fuel and spare parts at his workshop. Gen
Aideed was also at the site. 'This is an unjust and criminal act against
Somali people,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Confusion at EBRD over top management changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of directors at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
will this week try to postpone any formal decision to appoint Mr Ernest
Stern, the present number two at the World Bank, as the EBRD's new senior
vice-president.
Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president in charge of merchant
banking, who told colleagues on Friday he would probably resign, yesterday
decided to stay on and is likely to support the directors' campaign to
postpone any decision on the bank's management reorganisation.
Some directors want to delay changes until after an audit into the bank's
control of expenditure is completed on July 15. They believe it would be
wrong to restructure the management until they can assess who was
responsible at the bank for the overspending on its new building, the
charter of private aeroplanes and other expenses reported in recent months.
The directors believe a decision to appoint Mr Stern now could make it
difficult to remove Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, should the audit
report criticise him.
Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, who is chairman of the EBRD's
governors, last week expressed her support for a delay in the management
reorganisation until after the audit report.
The issue threatens to become a serious row between the senior financial
officials of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries which own 54
per cent of the bank's shares, known as the G7 deputies, and the non-G7
members of the board of directors.
The G7 deputies offered Mr Stern the new appointment without reference to
the board of directors. 'The G7 deputies have been duplicitous,' said one
EBRD director, who believes they have gone behind the back of the board of
directors.
The directors oppose Mr Stern's appointment for several other reasons.
They believe it will lead to a radical shift away from the bank's original
philosophy of focusing on financing the fledgling private sector in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union to a more traditional development banking
strategy of investing in infrastructure. At a board meeting last Thursday,
most directors made it clear to Mr Attali that they would strenuously oppose
such a change.
Some directors are also angry after being told that Mr Stern has been
offered an after-tax salary of Pounds 250,000, similar to Mr Attali's.
Together with other benefits, this is equivalent to a pre-tax package of
about Pounds 700,000.
Appointments of vice-presidents must be approved by the EBRD's board of
directors, which meets today. Nine directors will make clear this week they
will use procedural devices to prevent the appointment of Mr Stern until
they have received the report by the bank's audit committee on why the bank
spent Pounds 55.5m on fitting out its headquarters and why it has been lax
in control of other expenditure.
Mr Stern is understood to have accepted the offer of a position as deputy to
Mr Attali. That role has, in effect, been filled by Mr Freeman, who is
understood to be bitterly disappointed that Mr Attali has supported the
recruitment of Mr Stern. A bank executive said Mr Freeman feels he has given
unwavering support to Mr Attali since details of overspending and
mismanagement at the bank were disclosed in April.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Barclays on short-list to buy DoT computer services agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, is on the short-list of bidders to buy the
organisation that provides computer services to the Department of Transport
and its executive agencies.
DVOIT, based in Swansea, was formerly the drivers, vehicle and operators
information technology arm of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which
remains its largest customer. It became a separate executive agency just
over a year ago, with an annual turnover of about Pounds 26m and about 480
employees.
There are four other bidders on the short-list: EDS-Scicon, the information
technology subsidiary of General Motors of the US, Computing Sciences
Corporation of the US, Hoskyns, the UK computing services group, and a
consortium combining DVOIT managers and IBM of the US.
Barclays said it wanted to exploit the expertise it has acquired over the
past 30 years from running one of the country's biggest computer systems,
which provides money transmission, cheque clearing and settlement services.
Its bid is part of a bold strategy to reduce its dependence on earnings from
traditional banking activities. In common with many banks, Barclays expects
only modest growth in sales of banking services in the next few years. No
other UK clearing bank has gone as far as Barclays in seeking to sell its
computer expertise to other companies.
A year ago, Barclays set up a trading business, Barclays Computer
Operations, which runs the bank's computer operations and also competes to
manage other companies' computers, a service known as facilities management.
Since launching BCO, it has made an abortive bid to manage the Inland
Revenue's computer operations, which are being contracted out to the private
sector.
The bank said that in the past year BCO had acquired 10 clients in addition
to working for the bank. It said these included some substantial UK
companies, though it declined to name them.
It also refused to comment on its bid for DVOIT because it has signed a
confidentiality agreement with the government.
DVOIT has three mainframe computers which can be accessed from 4,000
terminals in 200 offices throughout the UK. The DoT said it hoped to
complete the privatisation by the end of the year.

FT  14 JUN 93 / Cabinet rift emerges on spending and tax policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET rifts over government spending and tax policies opened yesterday as
Mr Michael Heseltine raised the spectre of Tory manifesto promises becoming
casualties of the battle to control public borrowing.
As senior Tories sought to brush off further falls in opinion polls, the
trade and industry secretary's comments contrasted with those of rightwing
cabinet ministers who made clear their opposition to reneging on the
Conservative's 1992 election pledge not to increase income tax.
The row precedes Thursday's cabinet meeting on public spending when Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will tell his colleagues that public
spending cannot breach the Pounds 253.6bn ceiling set for the 1994-95
financial year.
Mr Clarke will tomorrow break with recent tradition and use the annual
Mansion House speech in the City - his detailed policy address as chancellor
 -for a wide-ranging review of economic issues.
A damaging split over tax and spending priorities, likely to continue over
the summer as the Treasury struggles to curb departmental budgets, will add
to the difficulties Mr John Major faces in restoring confidence in his
leadership.
In an interview yesterday, the prime minister said he was 'philosophically
attracted to the lowest possible level of taxation'. But he was not prepared
to pre-judge November's Budget.
Mr Major faces the ignominy today of a review by the rightwing 92 group of
Tory backbenchers of Conservative party prospects. Their message, although
coated in language supportive of the prime minister, is expected to make
plain that, in their eyes, he is on probation.
Senior figures on the Tory right confirmed yesterday that Mr Clarke,
although pro-European, could win their support in a future Conservative
leadership election if he successfully cuts state spending rather than
increasing taxes.
Most Tory MPs consider a leadership challenge unlikely this year. Few -
including Mr Major in his Mail on Sunday interview - rule out a contest
before the general election.
Speaking on BBC television, Mr Heseltine said he expected 'turbulence ahead'
for the government and predicted the economy, schools testing and policy on
Europe 'are going to cause us considerable difficulties'.
Asked about income tax rises, Mr Heseltine said the chancellor had to
're-visit' all options for tackling the deficit. But he added: 'You will
find in practically every case that there is a manifesto commitment which
blocks off the options, and if you then say 'fine, we've made a manifesto
commitment, all the options are blocked off', well, I tell you, it won't be
a Pounds 50bn deficit we're dealing with next year, it will be a bigger
one.'
His comments contrasted with those of Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, who said on BBC radio that the Conservatives' opposition to tax
rises meant 'we have to put the spotlight on public expenditure'. He said
stories about breaking manifesto pledges 'are simply false'.
An NOP opinion poll in the Independent on Sunday put Conservative support at
a 12-year low of 27 per cent. A Mori poll for The Sunday Times showed only
16 per cent satisfied with Mr Major's performance, a postwar low for a
British prime minister.

FT  14 JUN 93 / UN troops kill 12 in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTANI troops serving with the United Nations operation in Somalia killed
at least 12 people yesterday when they opened fire on a 4,000-strong
demonstration. Supporters of Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the warlord whose
forces the UN is attempting to disarm, were protesting peacefully in the
centre of the capital Mogadishu.
The shootings followed two nights of US-led air strikes that crippled Gen
Aideed's clandestine weapons stockpiles. The operation was authorised by the
UN Security Council after Aideed gunmen killed 23 Pakistani Blue Helmets
last weekend.
The actions of the UN forces have buried its humanitarian mission in
Somalia. Mogadishu is now a city besieged by a multinational occupation
army. Gen Aideed's supporters in the south of the clan-divided capital are
stunned and angry.
Tanks patrol the streets. Helicopters swoop down to disperse crowds.
Lorry-loads of detained men, women and children are being corralled at the
grounds of the former university, now a US military centre.
UN tanks rolled by and ignored pleas for help from the many wounded in
yesterday's shootings. On Saturday Pakistani troops fired into a crowd after
stones were thrown. Their shots killed one Somali and wounded a woman and a
man. The woman died later at Benadir hospital, where the injured were being
operated on without anaesthetic on makeshift wooden tables swarming with
flies.
The heavy-handedness of the Pakistani contingent has been a leading cause of
rising tension and hostility against the UN in the capital. Brigadier Ikram
ul-Hasan, commander of the 4,000 Pakistani peacekeeping troops in the Somali
capital, told a press conference yesterday that he was investigating
yesterday's incident. 'The simple fact is that gunmen use women and children
as human shields,' he said.
The brigadier said he did not think his troops were an inflammatory
presence. Nor did he think there had been a violation of the UN's rules of
engagement.
Other UN military spokesmen have refused to comment. But the French relief
agency Medecins sans Frontieres, one of the few still operating in the
capital, described yesterday's killings as monstrous.
At the hospital, a doctor said he was sickened by the events: 'The UN has
started another war in Somalia. The people are tired of war. Even if they
kill Aideed, there are thousands of other Aideeds out there to take his
place.'
The midnight bombings were undertaken with surgical precision to avoid
civilian casualties. US Cobra helicopters and slow-flying aircraft picked
out three armament sites and Gen Aideed's radio station during the first
strike over Mogadishu on Saturday.
The bombers returned early yesterday to destroy what the UN claimed was a
'veritable fortress' containing weapons, ammunition and armoured vehicles.
It belonged to Mr Osman Ato, Gen Aideed's financier. The explosion lit up
the night in the blacked-out city. Later, a building held by Pakistani
peacekeepers came under heavy rocket attack from Gen Aideed's gunmen.
Reporters visiting the bombed site yesterday saw no evidence of burned-out
ammunition stockpiles. Mr Ato claims he stored only fuel and spare parts
there.
Gen Aideed was also at the site. 'This is an unjust and criminal act against
Somali people,' he said and called for world condemnation of the human
rights violations by Pakistani troops. He said he would not hand over those
responsible for the June 5 killing of Pakistani troops: 'I will remain with
my people'.
Mr Jonathan Howe, UN special envoy to Somalia, says the warlord still has an
obligation to 'provide an explanation of who ordered and conducted the
gruesome killing, mutilation and torture of Pakistani peacekeepers'.
Gen Cevik Bir, the Turkish commander of the 18,300 UN forces in Somalia,
said the air raids were a warning to Somalia's warlords that the UN was
prepared to act firmly. 'If the principal (warlords) are eliminated the
Somali people will be on our side,' he said,
The military offensive against Gen Aideed risks transforming the UN into a
new colonial power, and Somalia into a reluctant trustee.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Henderson to merge trusts - Touche
Remnant takeover leads to major reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration is reorganising its unit trust range following its
acquisition of Touche Remnant. The combined group will aim to reduce the
number of trusts under management from 35 to 21 via a programme of mergers.
In the majority of cases, TR trusts will be absorbed by Henderson funds
although, in some instances, a TR manager will take over running the trust.
All mergers will need to be approved by unitholders. At least 10 per cent
must vote on the issue and, of those, 75 per cent must vote in favour.
When mergers occur, investors' units are transferred on an offer-to-offer
basis. Suppose you owned 100 units in fund A, where the offer price was
100p, making your holding worth Pounds 1,000 (before the cost of the
spread). If fund A merges with fund B, where the offer price is 200p, you
will receive 500 units.
The new range of trusts divides into five sectors:
UK Growth. This will consist of three trusts. Best of British, which will
absorb TR General Growth, invests in well-known UK companies and will be
managed by David Gillott. Special Situations will continue as before. UK
Smaller Companies will be formed by merging TR's Smaller Companies and
Special Opportunities funds, and will be managed by John Alexander.
UK Income. There will be four trusts in this sector. Income &amp; Growth will be
formed when Henderson Income and Growth absorbs TR Income and Growth and the
manager will be former TR man Gary West. The High Income fund will absorb
Henderson Smaller Companies Dividend and will be managed by James Henderson.
The remaining trusts, Extra Income and Preference &amp; Gilt, will be run as
before.
International. A big change here with TR Worldwide Special Situations, TR
Overseas Growth &amp; Henderson Global Resources all being merged into Henderson
International, run by Rupert Carnegie. The former Henderson Fixed Interest
fund is changing its name and objectives to become the Global Bond fund
under Ian Dickson. The other two international funds, Global Technology and
Family of Funds, are not changing.
US. The TR American Growth will be absorbed by the Henderson American
Smaller Companies fund, run by Davina Walter. The other fund in the sector,
North America (managed by Chris Galleymore) invests in larger US companies.
Far East. A big merger in this sector with TR Far East Opportunities, Spirit
of the East and Henderson Australian being absorbed by the Asian Enterprise
fund. Asian Enterprise, run by Heather Manners invests in Asia, excluding
Japan. The TR Japan Growth fund is also merging into Henderson Japan,
managed by Michael Wood-Martin. Henderson's other two trusts in the area,
Japan Special Situations and Pacific Smaller Companies, will continue as
before.
Europe. No changes here with four funds remaining in place: European Special
Situations, European, European Smaller Companies and European Income.
Can investors lose out from the process? Because exchange is taking place at
offer prices, one way investors could suffer would be if the bid-offer
spread of the new trust was wider than on the existing holding. Another
problem would occur if the annual charge on a new fund was higher than on
the old fund. But Henderson says the charges on the two groups' products
were pretty similar.
A fund manager who takes over another's portfolio may want to sell the
unwanted stocks, involving the fund in higher than usual dealing costs and
affecting performance.
Finally, investors also need to be know when the merged fund has different
objectives from their old fund - someone who opted specifically for
Henderson Australasian, for example, might not want to invest in a more
general fund.
Having said all that, there are far too many funds in the unit trust
industry and rationalisation is inevitable. If funds are too small to be
profitable, neither the investor nor the manager is likely to get a good
deal. So, provided existing unitholders are aware of the possible dangers,
there is little reason to be concerned about the Henderson reorganisation.

FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tide turned against Kingfisher, recently the favourite of the stores
sector, when Strauss Turnbull issued a sell note and fears over a price war
in the DIY sector took hold.
The shares finished 7 lower at 590p.
Texas, Ladbroke's DIY subsidiary, is mounting an aggressive price
discounting campaign, which is no help to Kingfisher, a major player in the
DIY market through its B&amp;Q chain.
Mr Robert Snaith, stores analyst at Strauss, also stressed that renewed
confidence in Boots, one of Kingfisher's main store rivals, contributed to
the downturn in Kingfisher shares. He believed there was a certain amount of
overcapacity in stores and that perhaps 'Kingfisher has had it its own way
for a little too long.'
Elsewhere in DIY-related stocks, WH Smith 'A' fell back 6 to close at 439
and J Sainsbury went 12 lower at 485p in thin turnover.
ICI dropped to 680p early in the session, before staging a late rally to
close only a shade off at 691p. There were hints in the market that a round
of substantial profits downgrades, possibly down to around the Pounds 200m
to Pounds 230m level, compared with current estimates of around the Pounds
300m mark, could be in the pipeline.
A mixture of nervousness and profit-taking dogged property companies with
the majority giving up recently gained ground. British Land lost 6 to close
at 320p; Great Portland Estates fell back 9 to 183p in the aftermath of
BZW's sell note. Palmerston Holdings saw its value slashed by more than half
with the price tumbling from 15p to 6p after news that receivers had been
appointed at several of its subsidiaries.
The market reserved judgment on Coats Viyella although it announced a Pounds
35m acquisition of Berghaus, the Dutch distributor of women's coats and
jackets. The shares fell back 3 to 224p on the move, financed by a placing
of 15.2m shares at 218p. One analyst said that more eyes will be on a
company presentation next week which will reveal its strategy for India and
Brazil.
Recommendations from Henderson Crosthwaite and SG Warburg boosted Cadbury
Schweppes and the shares gained 12 to 459p in trade of 2.2m.
Scottish and Newcastle benefited from a recommendation from Nomura and put
on 7 to 464p.
Insurance brokers attracted buying interest after a number of influential
stockbroking analysts adopted a bullish stance.
Willis Corroon, the sector leader, jumped 8 to 210p, with analysts said to
have been upgrading their profits estimates for next year to the Pounds 100m
mark. Sedgwick moved up 6 to 186p. Lloyd Thompson added 9 to a record 303p.
Shares in English China Clays recovered from an early retreat which followed
the surprise announcement of a Pounds 113.4m cash call to help fund the
Pounds 202.3m acquisition of Calgon, a speciality chemicals business in the
US. Having fallen to 402p in early trading, the shares closed 9 ahead at
425p, as analysts pointed to the benefits of the purchase and plans to
demerge its construction materials business.
Rolls-Royce edged  1/2 forward to 152p, with the stock said to have
benefitted from some switching from British Aerospace. The switching and
general profit-taking following the strong run for most of the week left BAe
15 lighter at 410p.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Du Pont 'knew of Benlate defects'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLORIDA officials have subpoenaed officials at Du Pont, the leading US
chemicals group, after concluding from company documents that Du Pont knew
its Benlate fungicide had caused crop damage but failed to act.
Du Pont suspended payments on Benlate-related suits in November, after
extensive research, during which the company said it could not duplicate the
effects attributed to Benlate.
Florida crop growers allege the fungicide caused Dollars 1bn in crop damage
through stunted growth, root damage, twisted and deformed leaves and poor
yield. Although most lawsuits centre on crop damage, a few allege that
Benlate caused birth defects.
In a letter to Mr Bob Crawford, Florida's agriculture commissioner, Du Pont
said: 'The issue is whether Benlate, at label rates and under conditions of
ordinary commercial use, caused the plant damage reported by growers in
Florida and elsewhere after March 1991. Based on all of our scientific
testing, the answer is a resounding: No.'
Florida officials allege that internal documents show incorrect labels on
the product.
Mr Edgar Woolard, Du Pont's chief executive, and other officials have been
ordered to testify at the state Capitol in July in an effort by the Florida
Department of Agriculture to prove that internal documents show the company
knew the fungicide had caused problems.

<TEXT>
Mr Martin Landau, a well-known property entrepreneur who left the UK
property industry in 1990 following the takeover of Imry Merchant
Developers, has returned to the sector becoming deputy chairman of Clayform
Properties, a small property company, writes Vanessa Houlder.
He and Mr Anthony Bodie, another property entrepreneur who has also joined
the board, have bought a 5 per cent stake at 14p a share. Mr Landau intends
using the company as a vehicle for acquisitions.
Mr Landau founded City Merchant Developers in 1986, after a management
buy-out of part of Guinness Peat Properties, where he was managing director.
In 1988 the company merged to become Imry Merchant Developers where he was
deputy chairman, with responsibility for a Pounds 1bn development programme.
He left after the Pounds 314m takeover by a consortium of private investors
that eventually collapsed leaving the company in the ownership of Barclays
Bank.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Government plan creates 200 homes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 200 homes have been created by turning vacant property above shops
into comfortable flats, housing minister Sir George Young said yesterday. He
said that of the Pounds 5m allocated to the Flats over Shops scheme in its
first year of operation (1992/93) the indications are that almost all of it,
Pounds 4.7m, had been spent.
Sir George, visiting a scheme in Brixham, Devon, said: 'Bringing flats over
shops back into residential use not only contributes to the growth of
available housing for rent, it also brings life back into our town centres,
improves shop front security, and turns a drain on a landlord's resources
into an assured income.
'This scheme has encouraged shop owners to recognise the potential financial
gains which can be realised by bringing into use accommodation over retail
premises.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / Deadline in IRA extradition case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal judge in the extradition case of a suspected IRA member
yesterday gave the British government one week to hand over eight sensitive
documents on British policy in Northern Ireland.
District judge Barbara Caulfield gave the prosecution until June 18 to
produce the classified documents which a defence attorney maintains are
vital to the case of Mr James Smyth, one of 38 prisoners who escaped from
Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1983.
The documents, most of which have not been made public in Britain, include
one alleging collusion between security forces in Northern Ireland and
Protestant paramilitary groups.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Building revival remains elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL in house-building shows little sign of spreading to other areas
of construction, many of which which remain stuck in recession, to figures
published yesterday by the environment department show.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of the country's biggest
construction companies, warned this week that a recovery in general
contracting was unlikely to occur before 1995 at the earliest. He said
competition for UK work was intense so that margins were very low.
Wimpey's house sales, by comparison, were 55 per cent higher in the first
five months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said
yesterday that the industry remained in a serious recession 'with output set
to fall by a further 3 per cent this year and the construction jobless total
heading for half a million since summer 1989'.
The environment department said total construction work in Great Britain was
5 per cent lower in the first three months of this year than a year before.
Private-sector commercial work, mainly offices and shops, was worst
affected, with output down 25 per cent.
A glimmer of hope from the department's figures was provided by a 5 per cent
rise in private industrial work. Contractors say, however, that
manufacturers and service industries will not invest in new buildings until
they are confident that economic recovery can be sustained.

FT  12 JUN 93 / N Korea bows to US over N-treaty
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA last night agreed to suspend indefinitely its proposed
withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which was to have gone
into effect today.
The decision was announced in a joint statement with the US at the end of
four rounds of talks initiated by the Americans and held in the offices of
the US mission to the UN.
North Korea's decision to back down left unresolved the question of whether
the Pyongyang government would submit to international inspection of nuclear
weapons laboratories.
But the two countries agreed to continue their talks 'on an equal and
unprejudiced basis'.
The US has been pressing the North Korean communists not to go ahead with
their threat to withdraw from the pact, which aims to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons.
As an inducement, the Americans indicated earlier they might suspend
military exercises with South Korea.
The North Koreans are also keen to develop economic relations with the US,
and UN diplomats said this was probably a big factor in their decision.
Ukraine will temporarily retain nuclear missiles on its territory, possibly
for up to two years, Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament
and a member of the ruling troika, said yesterday, writes Chrystia Freeland
in Kiev.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Russifield Donbass coal miners' strike continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE by the coal miners of the Russified Donbass region yesterday
entered its third day. The miners' demands for higher pay and a new
government appeared to be strengthened rather than quelled by President
Kravchuk's emotional appeal for social calm in a half-hour appearance on
Ukrainian television.
Mr Ivan Pliushch, Ukrainian parliament chairman, quashed hopes that prime
minister Leonid Kuchma, who successfully faced down several miners' strikes
in the spring, will be granted the extraordinary powers over the economy he
has been seeking. This is despite the boost to his popularity which followed
his call last week for Ukraine to keep nuclear weapons on its territory.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Senior executive at EBRD threatens to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was thrown into turmoil
last night by the news that its first vice-president, Mr Ronald Freeman, is
'seriously considering' resigning.
Mr Freeman has not 'finalised his decision', according to a bank executive,
but directors fear he is likely to resign in protest at a reorganisation of
the bank's management orchestrated by the governments of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries.
Mr Freeman was unavailable for comment.
'It would be a serious blow to the bank,' said one of the EBRD's directors,
who represent the 54 countries and agencies which own the bank. The EBRD
refused to make any official comment last night. Mr Freeman is in charge of
merchant banking and was viewed inside and outside the bank as the number
two to the president, Mr Jacques Attali.
Bank directors believe Mr Freeman was unhappy that Mr Ernest Stern, number
two at the World Bank, has been approached to fill the new post of senior
vice-president of the EBRD in charge of both its merchant banking and
development banking operations.
Mr Stern has been offered the post by officials representing the G7
countries. They have been trying to bring stability to the bank, which has
been widely criticised for excessive spending on private aircraft and on its
London headquarters.
However, bank directors said last night that the G7 governments had caused
increased turmoil in the bank by prompting the possible departure of Mr
Freeman, who is widely liked and admired within the organisation.
As part of a reorganisation at the bank, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the EBRD's
head of development banking, is also expected to be promoted to be another
senior vice-president.
In that case, Mr Freeman would effectively be demoted to number four.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Love and peace and (lost) dreams - The
Sixties are back - and we've never had it so bad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Sixties are in. In and groovy again, as the woolly liberal outfit
lovingly dusts down its memories of Paris in 1968. They were there: Left
Bank and Right On, hanging loose and tripping hard; forging iron in the
soul, growing grass on the brain. All right, they argue now, we never did
get love and peace: but at least we tried. We had ideals, we had dreams. If
we tilted at the law, we did it with flowers and beautiful intentions.
When we danced to the sound of breaking glass, we were really gyrating to
hope-heavy vibes. It was all in the cause of a better world, you see: the
youth of today just don't care . . .
I have some problems with this. Yeah. I take a kind of griefy view of all
that stuff. Including the wretched parlance of sub-McLuhan communication. My
own theory is that the 1960s are responsible for just about everything that
currently poisons our existence. I asserted as much to one of the decade's
apologists, who has challenged me to document this slur on her kaftan-clad
peers. And don't go on about Sir Hugh Casson's carbuncles, she said, because
the South Bank complex started in 1951.
Well, here is part of my answer: the first entries of an alphabetical
catalogue of 1960s catastrophes, duly omitting Hugh Casson and his blocks
for commissars.
You might prefer to think of these two simply as a disastrous aristocratic
couple; or as the two most horrible components of one annus horribilis,
1963.
Beeching, Lord. Checking his vignette in Anthony Sampson's Anatomy of
Britain, I find Beeching commended for his surgical ruthlessness and hailed
as a hero. Poor Anthony Sampson. But the real victims of Beeching's butchery
were not the little Welsh stationmasters who had the lobelias swept from
their waiting-room windowboxes, nor the pipe-chewing peasants who boarded at
Piddle Magna. They are all those hapless citizens now condemned to circulate
these over-crowded, tarmac-laden isles in stinking solipsistic cars.
One day - not far away - when the 64m cars have almost stunk us out of our
own habitat, we shall have cause to pore over old Ordnance Survey maps, and
tragically reflect that there was once a sane and sociable system of
transport in our country. It would not be the first or last time that a
civil servant has acted in the interests of short-term gains of efficiency:
but if Beeching was a Sixties hero, then the Sixties are damned for a rotten
taste in heroes.
Heroes ought to have vision; if Beeching had gazed even ten years beyond his
surgical axeing and pruning, he would have known that his reforms were not
for the health of the nation, but its ruin.
Chatterley, Lady. In spite of his beard, DH Lawrence would have been an
unhappy man at Woodstock. And anyone who knows their Lawrence will
appreciate that the lifting of the Chatterley ban, considered as another
typical Sixties event,would have been repugnant to the author himself. As a
sales stunt by Penguin Books the trial was bad enough. But if Lawrence could
see the direct line of descent he spawned, from Lady Chatterley through Oh,
Calcutta] to Jilly Cooper, I believe he would have chewed up his own
manuscript in rage.
The aim of Lady Chatterley was to get the British to stop sniggering about
life below the navel. Its issue in mass paperback did nothing of the sort.
Quite the opposite: prurience, formerly restricted to seaside postcards,
became ubiquitous. So not only did it signal the eclipse of what Jilly
Cooper so charmingly calls the 'honkless novel', but it created a new field
of copy for ephemeral publication.
From the Profumo affair to the toe-sucking headlines of the 1990s, we are
still sniggering and itching to know. Much better to have kept Lady
Chatterley as a minor collector's item, a literary curiosity. The
'permissive' Sixties seem only to have had the effect of legitimising
transgression as a form of vulgar entertainment. They made the bed and
forced us not only to lie in it, but nudge-nudge everyone else to advertise
the fact.
Shall I go on? This is a compendiously damnable list, right up to Wilson,
Harold, and Zurich, gnomes of. But I rest my case.

FT  12 JUN 93 / A social evil called tourism: Richard Tomkins questions the
value to Britain of foreign visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRONOMICALLY speaking, summer does not arrive in the northern hemisphere
until June 22. But in London, you can tell the season has started - less
because the capital has briefly basked in sunshine this week than because it
is bursting with the annual invasion of foreign tourists.
Britain is the world's fifth most popular holiday destination, but while
many of its citizens have the occasional grumble about this phenomenon, few
question whether it is a good thing. Spending by overseas visitors brings in
more than Pounds 7bn a year in foreign earnings, Britons are told. The
tourist industry contributes more than Pounds 25bn a year to the economy and
provides 1.8m jobs. Many of London's theatres, shops and restaurants might
close if the tourists stayed away.
Yet this is a bogus assessment, for it looks at only one side of the
equation. A proper analysis would start with the fact that British
holidaymakers going abroad spend Pounds 3bn a year more than foreign
tourists bring in, so the net effect is negative. But even leaving this
aside, there are other costs that ought to be shown on the balance sheet.
One example is the cost of maintaining redundant emblems of the national
heritage for tourists to gawp at, such as old buildings, oddly-attired
soldiers and the royal family. Another is the cost to British taxpayers of
providing foreigners with subsidised arts and entertainment, subsidised
transport, and public services such as refuse collection and policing. And
what figure shall we put on the costs of the traffic congestion caused by
hundreds of tourist coaches grinding around the capital each day?
The benefits of tourism, meanwhile, are not what they are cracked up to be.
Take those 1.8m jobs. Pickpocketing, drug peddling and prostitution aside,
most are not only degrading and servile, but extremely badly paid. Certainly
in the capital, it is rare to find any cases where tourism provides jobs for
the indigenous population. Britons would sooner beg on the streets than wash
other people's dirty bed linen, grill their hamburgers or sweep up their
litter.
As for the theatres, shops and restaurants that would be imperilled if the
tourists stayed away, still unexplained is the mystery of how they thrived
for so long before the tourists arrived. For theatres, the most obvious
effect of tourism has been to reduce diversity by encouraging the
proliferation of mindless musicals that foreigners can tap their toes to
without needing to understand the words.
And what of the tourists themselves? Do they really derive any pleasure or
benefit from watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, being
cheated by the street vendors that prey on them, or eating hamburgers in
different branches of McDonald's? Not at all: they gain nothing in terms of
enlarging their understanding of another culture. They are simply
country-spotting, collecting passport stamps and snapshots with which to
impress their neighbours once they are back home.
In short, the time has come to recognise that if tourism confers any
benefits at all, they are far outweighed by the disbenefits. Ideally, it
should be abolished: but since freedom of movement is a human right, a more
cautious approach will have to suffice.
One possibility would be to start recognising tourism as a social evil, like
smoking or drinking, and to forbid activities which promote it. As a first
step, all tourist offices would be closed, and the vast sums used to finance
them diverted to more productive ends. And as an interim measure towards the
prohibition of tourism advertising, legislation would require all tourist
advertisements to be accompanied by the warning: 'Tourism damages your
country's health.'
Planning policies would also change, so that any application that held the
possibility of encouraging tourism would be refused. Heavy tourist taxes
would be introduced, partly to discourage people from indulging in tourism
in the first place and partly to ensure that those who persisted in
travelling compensated society for the costs of their habit.
The trouble is, all this could prove too controversial for Britain's
beleaguered government. There is, however, an alternative. Last time Britain
was faced with the threat of an invasion, during the second world war, its
citizens stopped talking to strangers and turned all the signposts round so
they pointed in the wrong direction. Desperate times call for desperate
measures: it is time to resume hostilities.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Private View: When every citizen has his shout - Democracy
was invented 2,500 years ago in Athens. Scholar and diplomat Sir David Hunt
discusses whether we have improved on it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON will be treated next week to the spectacle of an Athenian trireme of
the Fifth Century BC - the fastest, sleekest wooden warship in history -
paddling down the river Thames to call on the mother of parliaments at
Westminster.
The trireme Olympias has been freighted from Piraeus to provide the climax
to a little-remarked anniversary: the invention of democracy 2,500 years ago
in Athens, by Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid.
As it happens, Olympias is more than a symbol of the technological cunning
and maritime imperialism of ancient Attica, more than a symbol of the
Greeks' political legacy. She is also a product of British philhellenism.
Until a few years ago most experts said the trireme, a two-masted ramming
machine powered by 170 citizen oarsmen arranged in three tiers, was a
mechanical impossibility. Then two British scholars, John Morrison, a
classics professor, and John Coates, a former chief naval architect at the
Ministry of Defence, assembled the evidence, reconstructed the design and
persuaded the Greek navy to build it.
The Athenian trireme turned out to be real. But how real was Athenian
democracy?
I took the question to Sir David Hunt, a classical scholar and diplomat, a
79-year-old polymath and polyglot who is married, as it happens, to a
Greek-Cypriot wife.
Sir David trained as an archaeologist and has what is usually called a
first-class mind. His retirement hobbies, when he is not devouring books (at
present the essays of A E Housman and the plays of Aphra Behn), include
reaching the finals of The Times crossword championship and winning - twice
 -the Mastermind challenge on television.
He got a First at Oxford, naturally, and became a Fellow of Magdalen
College. During the second world war he served on General Alexander's staff.
Later he was seconded as private secretary to both Clement Attlee and
Winston Churchill before becoming high commissioner to Nigeria (during the
Biafra War), Uganda, Cyprus and ambassador to Brazil.
His discourse is encyclopaedic and interjected with phrases I had thought
extinct, such as 'Bless my soul]' and 'Capital]'. But the old-buffer act is
a ploy. As they say in clubland, Sir David knows his stuff.
He explained how in 508-7 BC Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid proclaimed the
doctrine of 'isonomia', or equality under the law, and reorganised the
voters into 139 constituencies to elect the Committee of Five Hundred
(equivalent to the British House of Commons). He left intact the Council of
the Areopagus, consisting of former magistrates (like the House of Lords)
but all laws proposed by the 'parliament' were to be submitted to the
ekklesia, the mass meeting of citizens (no women, no slaves) in the market
place.
'This is the vital difference between Greek and present-day democracy (I
shall treat Britain as a perfect democracy),' he said. 'One is participatory
and the other is representational.'
I mentioned the row over Maastricht and public demands for a referendum.
Should we bring back the ekklesia? We would not have to go to the market
place. With television we could vote at the touch of a button . . .
'The danger is, first, that you put perhaps an oversimplified question to
the electorate. Second, if people as a whole are consulted you are very
liable to get false reactions. If I may refer to Thucydides, that was
illustrated by the debate about the revolt of Mytilene in which the
demagogue Cleon incited the assembly (in 427 BC) to decide to execute all
the males and sell the women into slavery. The next day another demagogue
reversed it and a 'fast trireme' was sent to overtake the first. Voters may
be swayed by oversentimental arguments.'
Is that worse than being swayed by slogans got up by an advertising agency
for the purposes of winning a general election?
'Don't forget that for the purposes of winning a plebiscite advertising
agencies on both sides will also be inventing slogans,' he replied.
Sir David regrets the decline of the classical art of rhetoric, which in
Britain he associates with Stanley Baldwin's hatred of the flowery-tongued
David Lloyd George. On top of that, television required that a speaker
should look good. 'In the days of Abraham Lincoln you had to have something,
some ideas. Now you make a few cracks thought up by your staff, to last not
more than 40 seconds.'
In ancient Athens, political participation was seen as a civic duty. The
problem of backsliders was simply dealt with. On voting days a couple of
slaves would be sent through the agora carrying a rope dyed red and herding
the people towards the assembly place. Any citizen found with red on his
clothes was fined. Because modern citizens are not permitted to vote between
elections, I suggested, their participation was feeble. Should we bring back
the red rope?
'I think you're exaggerating there,' Sir David said. 'In Britain you do get
a turnout of about 80 per cent, whereas in the US 51 per cent is considered
pretty good. Of course in some countries voting is compulsory. I don't think
we do too badly.'
Another feature of ancient democracies was that certain public officials
were chosen by lot. Any merit in that?
'No. It may give you someone hopeless. Balloting may do too, of course, but
at least there is some kind of reason why you've got that one. More often
than not it produces outstandingly good results . . . think of the way the
parliamentary system won the last war. We were told so many times by Hitler
and Mussolini that democracies were inefficient talking shops and what was
wanted was firm leadership.'
And we gave Hitler half of Europe . . .
' . . . before we beat him. Yes, I agree with you there. But in the end,
when it came to the real crunch, the athletic, 'scientific' dictatorships
lost.'
What about ostracism? Is that a good device?
'Alas, no. They discovered a method of defeating it.' In a political trial
of strength the two antagonists learnt to collaborate and instructed their
supporters to mark their potsherds (ostraka) with the name of a third party.
Thus the pro-war demagogue Hyperbolus in 417 BC found himself sandwiched
between Alcibiades and Nicias. He was sent to Samos where he was later
murdered.
Was Norman Lamont ostracised?
'Yes, I think he was.' Sir David meant that the former chancellor could be
seen as the proxy victim of an internal party contest, sacrificed to public
(that is, press) opinion.
The Athenians had factions but no real political parties. Was that
preferable?
'I believe the development of parties to be the most important thing in the
whole democratic process,' Sir David said. 'You cannot really carry on a
proper discussion of public affairs unless you can get up a debate and you
can't get up a debate if everybody is a man of goodwill and agrees with each
other. You must get 'em going, you must have debate, and therefore you must
have parties.'
I asked: doesn't history show that democracy is a rather rare and unnatural
thing?
'Certainly if you take the whole of history from 800 BC to 330 AD, the
period occupied by democracy was pretty short, I agree. But on the whole it
was the best time. They did best under democracy. It is what they chose when
they were free, independent and powerful. And I think the same is true of
modern times.'
Due partly to the influence of Plato and Aristotle (neither of them keen
democrats) there was a long hiatus, through the Middle Ages and up to the
modern age, when democracy languished except in places such as Iceland and
Switzerland. 'And maybe Andorra', he added, 'though I'm not all that strong
on the medieval history of Andorra'.
Developing countries today - in Africa for example - though they did not
practise democracy at least claimed to do so. 'Usually they are gangs of
crooks, murderers and thieves who are there simply for the purpose of taking
money from every source they can find and putting it into Swiss bank
accounts - and they still call themselves the People's Democracy of
Whatever-it-may-be. It's the tribute vice pays to virtue.'
Is our idea of democracy really the same as the Athenians'? Isn't ours much
less mechanical, much more about individual liberty?
'I really do believe ancient Greek democracy was libertarian in its ideals.
I really do think the motive behind democracy was that one man was as good
as another.
'Alright, I can think of plenty of exceptions - add in women, and you've got
a very large exception. Nevertheless, it is a fact that Greeks - the Greeks
I'm talking about now, Athenians in the sixth century - really did think
that one man ought to be as good as another, at any rate in the way he was
treated. They knew people are not really equal: they must be treated as if
they were. This is a political fiction, if you like, but an exceptionally
useful fiction.'
Was this idealism, or rather the suspicion that if you did not pretend to
treat people equally eventually they would come with pitchforks and tip you
out?
'I think the former. It was partly religious, partly the rationalising of
Ionians who liked to treat men as atoms - different in terms of
individuality but important in the mass.'
I was not quite ready to let go: nevertheless, aren't we guilty of taking
too sentimental a view of ancient Greece?
'Yes is the answer to that - and a jolly good thing too,' harrumphed Sir
David. 'But I see what you mean and I will now reply properly to your
question:
'The Greek democracies had many abhorrent tendencies. This was pointed out,
I may say, by Greek observers at the time. The extreme democrats of Athens
were at the same time the most brutal imperialists. They were not
sentimentalists - they never had an 18th century.
'But, they did have an ideology in favour of freedom. It was a fact you
could always get a majority in the assembly in favour of saying all Greeks
everywhere ought to be free. You didn't give a damn about barbarians, but
Greeks ought to govern themselves, dammit]
'Although I've been condemning 'em, they had their bright side. And it was
this side that has the hope for the future. Because in the world as a whole
it is a good idea that people everywhere should be free to govern
themselves. It's quite likely they will govern themselves better than other
people will govern them.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: St Lucia finds a voice - Poetry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TINY, volatile Caribbean island of St Lucia is a paradise of sorts, and
Derek Walcott, this year's Nobel Laureate, is its most celebrated son.
Walcott is most famous for his poetry, less famous for his plays and least
famous of all for his paintings, though his painterly skills - as an
observer of the abundance of natural life on the island, for example - are
everywhere evident in the poetry.
By a happy coincidence, Walcott's reading from his epic-length poem Omeros
at the Purcell Room in London this week coincided with the first publication
of his Nobel Lecture, The Antilles Fragments of Epic Memory. A theme common
to both is the question of the status of the Caribbean and its indigenous
culture.
To the Victorian traveller, the Caribbean was an illegitimate, rootless
place. 'There are no people there,' said Froude, ' - in the true sense of
the word.' And even in our own day, a common Western attitude, no less
patronising, has been one of elegaic pathos. It is a culture fit to be wept
over - but not one to be taken too seriously. One of the most important
consequences of Walcott's Nobel Prize is that it has given a legitimacy to
Caribbean writing that many thought it lacked.
Walcott's 350 page narrative poem embraces many themes and characters. In
his reading he chose to concentrate on an under-explored thematic inlet: the
characters and pre-occupations of Major Dennis Plunkett and his Irish-born
wife Maud, a childless couple who settle on the island after the second
world war.
The Englishman Plunkett is a study in post-Imperialist disease. A veteran of
Monty's African campaign, he has grown accustomed to playing the officer's
pitch - all grit in the throat. The couple have retired to St Lucia because
it is a place 'where history cannot happen'. (History, of course,
disagrees.) They exchange the pastoral calm of rural England for the
'loud-mouthed forests on their illiterate heights', and the problems and
challenges of a society that has survived its French and English colonisers.
Walcott squats on a high stool for the reading, as if preparing himself,
like Plunkett, for the first drink of the evening. He looksmuch younger than
his 60-odd years. There is something imperious about the lordly nod he gives
the audience in return for their tumultuous reception of his presence. This
is the fourth time he has read from Omeros to a large London audience, and
his lulling baritone sounds curiously disengaged for most of the 150-odd
minutes that he reads - until he reaches the final section of the poem, an
account of Maud's death, which includes a marvellous mock-Imperial flourish:
'She was his orb and sceptre, / the shire of his peace.'
This is followed by a catalogue of the detritus of Empire, all mimosa
memories, ostrich-plumed Viceroys and felt-footed houseboys. The shock of
colliding with such marvellous poetry shakes Walcott into vigorous life in
the closing minutes. And next time he comes he will perhaps read from
something different . . .
What is the opposite of a Derek Walcott? Try Roger McGough. McGough, most
companionable of the Mersey Poets, raced through a dozen jaunty family
favourites in London last week. McGough's poems are not so much a plundering
of the word hoard as the springing open of a delectable box of tricks - all
puns, word play and happy chorus lines. An evening of Liverpudlian verve and
patter of this kind even makes you wonder whether poetry might not be a
participation sport after all. For all his virtues, Walcott never made it
sound easy.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: A Cave full of treasures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cave is Steve Reich and Beryl Korot's ambitious, technologically
dazzling, theatre piece: three hours of music, video images and computer
graphics which gnaw away at our received definitions of what theatre, opera
or music theatre ought to be. It received its first performance a month ago
in Vienna, moved on to Berlin and then for the first week of the Holland
Festival to Amsterdam, where it was presented in the wonderfully flexible
space of the Goederenbeurszaal in the old stock exchange building. In August
it moves to London for a season at the Royal Festival Hall.
The Cave is an exploration of Reich and Korot's Jewish heritage, or more
precisely the way in which part of that heritage, the story of Abraham and
Sarah and their sons Isaac and Ishmael, is retained and shared in the
memories of present-day Israelis, Palestinians and New Yorkers. The basis of
each of the three acts is a set of video interviews with prominent citizens
in West and East Jerusalem, and in New York; the images and the speech
provide the starting point for both Reich's music and Korot's visual
collages, as details of both are taken up and used as the jumping-off points
for detailed development.
Both sets of processes are fascinatingly worked out, and neatly
complementary; as the talking heads are projected on to one or more of the
five video screens that dominate the 'set' for The Cave, decorative details
from the images may be shown alongside them or computer-generated texts
reeled off in parallel in French, German, English or Arabic. Meanwhile the
performers - four singers and the 13 instrumentalists of the Steve Reich
Ensemble (conducted by Paul Hillier) - take up words, phrases, speech
rhythms or pitch collections from the video voices and weave around them
commentary and accompaniment.
The music produced is characteristic of recent Reich: Different Trains, the
string quartet he wrote for the Kronos Quartet and which also used archive
interviews, is the most obvious point of reference. The score is muscular,
intricately worked, carefully judged. Each of the first two acts kicks off
from the respective Jewish and Islamic responses to a set of questions that
begins with 'Who is Abraham?' and 'Who is Sarah?'. 'Abraham for me is my
ancestor' offers the first interviewee; 'Ibrahim was neither Jew nor
Christian, but a Muslim' asserts a Palestinian in the second act.
Both sets of responses are underpinned by the sound of the string quartet,
though when in both codas the focus changes and the screens offer a
travelogue showing Jerusalem and Hebron today, keyboards begin to colour the
sound world. The third act is altogether tighter and more colourful as the
American responses set up all kinds of allusions - 'Abraham Lincoln High
School, high on the hill midst sand and sea, that's as far's I trace
Abraham', admits Richard Serra. The whole ensemble is brought in, and the
musical climax is reached with a retelling of the story of Abraham and
Isaac, when the music darkens and becomes overtly expressive. The ending is
abrupt, matter of fact.
Reich and Korot have invented a richly woven tapestry, novel in its
presentation, delicately balanced in the issues it raises. There are no
overt political messages, but the historical undertow is inevitable in the
first two acts - 'The Cave' of the title is the place in which Abraham and
the patriarchs are reputed to be buried; it is now the site of a mosque. And
the sense of the US as hermetically sealed, cut off from that bundle of
racial and religious issues half way across the world, is tellingly conveyed
in the third.
The third act, indeed, just over half an hour long, is a bracing and
thrilling creation, fast-paced and full of wonderful visual and musical
invention. The first two acts, though, are too long, especially the opening
one, which takes 65 minutes to lay down the biblical background, and set up
the compositional techniques. With insufficient contrast of approach between
Acts 1 and 2, only (only]) the change of religious emphasis, the cumulative
musical impression is too diffuse; the audience has cottoned on to the use
of the video images and the computer keyboards rapping out text.
Yet so much about the concept of The Cave is thoughtful and fresh that one
almost forgives its longueurs. Reich has sought out a genuinely new
synthesis of sound and image. By the third act he and Korot are making it
work, and that final half an hour more than justifies his faith and the
audience's patience.
Performances of The Cave at the Royal Festival Hall, London run from August
18 to 23.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Elder takes his bow at ENO - Max Loppert pays tribute
to the end of an operatic era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAPTER is coming to its close. Two Saturday's hence, Mark Elder will
conduct Verdi's Macbeth - the final performance of the current English
National Opera season and under the current company troika. Thereafter Peter
Jonas moves to the Intendant's chair of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich,
while both David Pountney, ENO Director of Productions, and Elder, Music
Director, take up the freelance life.
Typically for a conductor whose work has always blazed with energy,
commitment and a sense of purpose, Elder is not letting himself out of the
job gently - his final month at the Coliseum in London has been filled with
nights on the podium. Typically, too, those nights have not been splashy.
Neither Macbeth nor Inquest of Love - the specially commissioned Jonathan
Harvey opera, of which Elder last week led the superbly confident premiere -
exactly counts as a conductor's show-off opera, even if each requires every
last ounce of masterly authority in their musical direction. Indeed, in his
Coliseum office, Elder pronounced the Harvey 'one of the very hardest things
I've ever done'.
I had gone there to cull his thoughts about the past decade at the ENO -
during which time the company became one of the most exciting in the world,
a company with 'attitude', where opera was put on in a spirit of innovative,
sometimes provocative exuberance, and always - the key quality - theatrical
engagement.
Elder is the Old Boy of the triumvirate. He had joined the company in 1974,
and in December 1979 succeeded Charles Groves as music director - Pountney
took over from Colin Graham (as director of productions) only in 1982, and
Jonas from Lord Harewood (as artistic administrator) in 1985. He had known
both Pountney and Jonas for a long time (Elder played bassoon and Pountney
trumpet in the National Youth Orchestra and later did opera together at
Cambridge; Elder and Jonas both worked at Glyndebourne in the late 1960s).
The force of will to bring these compagnons de guerre to the Coliseum is,
one senses, a quality Elder possesses in abundance. What happened there -
the invention of what he once defined as 'a contemporary house of
entertainment, a questioning, exploratory and youthful British opera
company' - was no single person's achievement. Yet Elder's share in it needs
just that bit of extra underlining - above all because musical standards at
the Coliseum have risen so remarkably high over the last decade, so that
even on those occasions when the production style seemed devised to drive
traditionalists mad, the inspired quality of music-making could hardly be
denied. How had that happened?
'In a gradual and sometimes painful way I had to try and set everybody's
sights a bit higher. Some people relish the challenge, and rise with it, and
do better than they've done, and feel better about themselves as a result;
others cannot keep up with the pace, and so you make changes of personnel,
which are painful.
'One of the things that's been most encouraging and inspiring for me is to
feel the company something like a liner moving away from the dock. You feel
it gradually starting to happen. Throughout the period there have been
crucial moments that pushed us forward in a sudden jump - such as the
arrival of certain key players in the orchestra. Gradually during the 1980s,
as London began to lose its position as the freelance capital of the world,
opportunities for session-playing diminished - with the result, for ENO,
that vacancies in the orchestra were answered by a much higher grade of
applicant.
'Thirteen years ago, one of the things I most wanted was a sense that every
night there would still be a good standard of orchestral playing - which I
didn't always feel to be the case in the 1970s. All of this is very
difficult to do without incurring a certain dissatisfaction in the house.
But I kept telling myself that any dissatisfactions we might be having now
are better than those I felt in earlier days.'
The vision of opera-as-theatre that unfolded during the 1980s was, as much
as anything else, his response to such dissatisfactions. 'When I joined the
company, in 1974, I had already worked at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden and
for the Australian Opera: three incredibly different companies. Right from
my very first experiences I watched how things were done well, or not, and
who was setting the standards.
'After I started at the Coliseum, I then had five-and-a-half years of
watching the company at work, and being frustrated. Above all, the type of
theatrical experience that the work offered was, I thought, not often enough
vivid, acute and involving. The attitude seemed to be that the staging
should never impinge.
'I just knew there was something more total that could happen. I had acted
at school and university. I was gripped by theatre. Seeing such things as
the Brook Lear was a revelation. In the opera house, apart from such
occasional things as the Koltai designs for the ENO Ring, I never felt that
design was an essential element of the theatrical experience.
'At Cambridge I had come alive to the dynamic power of dramatic music. But
in 1976 I worked with Joachim Herz (the producer from former East Germany)
and Jo Barstow on Salome at the Coliseum. We'd never seen anything so
consummately organised, with such theatrical integrity and unity. The way
Herz worked the singers was infuriating - he is very dictatorial - but never
at the expense of the singers' individuality: many of them showed a new
concentration. I suddenly thought, 'We need more of this]''.
In the 1980s, 'more of this' was what we started to get: productions by
Pountney, Herz, Harry Kupfer, Graham Vick, Nicholas Hytner, and - most
enraging to traditionalists - the American David Alden, all demanding a new
openness from audiences, and spurring performers to give their utmost. 'The
outstanding example of that was Alden's Mazeppa, in 1985. The '70s were full
of producers who said, 'You lift your spear here]' Anathema to me: that's
completely anti-music. What was so great about David was his way of
listening to the music, but trying to cajole the singers into finding the
scale for themselves. They all loathed having to do that, but they performed
like possessed gods.'
One of the points sometimes raised against the Elder-Pountney-Jonas regime
was its apparent favouring of the repertory margins, and corresponding
neglect of 18th century composers other than Mozart, or bel canto operas (of
which Elder, unlike Pountney, is actually a devotee) other than those by
Rossini. Did Elder accept the criticism? 'We all bring certain enthusiasms.
George Harewood certainly had his: I know he was sorry I was rather
dismissive of a certain type of French opera. That may have been me being
too hasty and arrogant.
'You're right: there were some types of opera we could have been persuaded
to think were part of our responsibility to the public; but we wanted to be
more robust, to say - this is a big theatre in the middle of London, and we
want to make a lively experience for the public, give them something
colourful, full of zest and attack and balls, if you like.
'But I failed to get this bel canto idea across only because there were so
many other enthusiasms. OK, I didn't get my Linda di Chamounix, even a nice
Lucia or Elisir, but I gave those up so we could do Janacek, Busoni, more
Verdi. It was a question of balance. One reason it will be interesting for
the company to have new leadership is that the balance will be re-set, the
decisions will be made with different enthusiasms.'
Does he want to lead another company, one day? 'Yes, I think so. I believe
in company life. There are still certain pieces I've never done, and others
I haven't done enough. When it is good, it seems better than anything else.
That won't change for me.'

<TEXT>
IN LAST week's Feedback, Chris Dunkley was told that Radio 4's Book at
Bedtime could be so stirring that some people could be kept awake. Listeners
were so aroused by, say, John Hadfield's Love on a Branch Line that they
could not drop off. Now Radio 3 offers daily Sleepless Nights. Someone -
this week, pianist David Owen Norris - recalls hard moments from their life
 -perhaps tiresome, but hardly liable to induce insomnia. Yet for safety's
sake, it is scheduled at 9.55 pm. I have no time for those who hear a
programme through and then complain of it. If Lawrence Scott's Witchbroom at
bedtime next week is disturbing, choices are to switch off, find another
station, or (for me), keep Radio 4 on till eleven for Two Way Cut, a Scots
police serial that began on Thursday with a gruesome death. If you expect a
disturbed night, have it properly disturbed.
Radio 3's Marlowe this week was Edward II, with able straightforward
direction by Clive Brill - a few cuts, some scenes moved to underscore the
order of events, lines read with intelligence if not much devotion to
character. For the National in 1968 Olivier preferred a version by Brecht;
few of us went along with that.
The plot tells of the peers' revolt against gay King Edward II (Robert
Glennister) for frolicking with his boyfriend Gaveston (Robert Patterson)
instead of ruling his country. Chief unruly peer is Young Mortimer (Steve
Hodson), whom the King suspects of loving his Queen, Isabelle (Adjoa Andon)
 -though she, in fact, stays so loyal to her husband that when their son
15-year-old Edward III succeeds (Monty Allen, rather good), he has to send
her to the Tower. Gaveston, captured by Mortimer and executed, is replaced
in the King's affection by Young Spenser, no luckier. The rebel lords win
and Edward is murdered in the horrible way we know about: Clive Brill gave
us a long scream, horrible enough. The play is reckoned an influence in
Shakespeare's Richard II. Shakespeare never heard Brecht, nor Colin Haydn
Evans. Evans's play Gaveston (Radio 4, Monday) has a new idea about
Gaveston. Marlowe's lot make him 'a Frenchman'; Brecht, an Irish butcher's
son; Evans reverts to France - the son of Arnaud de Gaveston. A secret faith
infects 14th-century Britain, holding that top folk are to be sacrificed for
the people's good, as in the case of Jesus. Lancaster, Warwick and the
Archbishop of Winchester belong to this cult, and Gaveston, exiled by the
King, is chosen to enact their 'Calvary'. He is ritually slain on a northern
hillside on Midsummer Day, his robed executioner one Robin of Barneside,
known as Robin of the Hood. I didn't believe a word of it. No 'mighty
lines', either.
I caught all I could of Test Match Special on Radio 5 and Radio 3, and
fairly exciting it was, thanks to the players more than the commentators.
Yet I thought the scenes after the game's end, with sponsors' cheques,
champagne moments, and men of the match, were unendurably squalid. This is
not cricket, not as I grew up with it.

<TEXT>
FOR SOMEONE who writes about the micro-world of Donegal, Brian Friel has a
formidable range. Those who admired his gentle Dancing at Lughnasa a couple
of years ago will find this revival of Translations, written in 1980, much
stronger meat.
Translations is almost an overtly political play. The time is 1833. The
English military have arrived to conduct the first ordnance survey of
Ireland. As David Killick's no- nonsense-from-the-natives Captain Lancey
explains, there are two reasons. One is to equip the military authorities
with 'up-to-date and accurate information in every corner of this part of
the empire'. The other is to provide a basis for a new land evaluation for
the purpose, he claims, of more equitable taxation. Subsequent developments
suggest that the military can be very brutal.
English audiences should not wince at that. Imperialism showed its nastier
side in Ireland. Harder to take is the hyper-romanticism of the Irish in the
first half of the 19th century. Every peasant, however drunken, carries a
copy of Homer in his pocket. The entire rural population attends hedge
schools where they imbibe arithmetic as well as the classics. They prefer to
converse in Greek and Latin rather than stoop to English.
Perhaps we should put that down to poetic licence. The main practical
criticism of Translations is structural. The play does not have an ending;
it just stops. There has been the heavy hint of the murder of an English
officer. The military is about to exact its revenge, first on the animals,
next on the people. Then Hugh, head of the hedge school, begins a long
speech about what came out of Troy: Urbs antiqua fuit. The curtain falls or,
in the case of the Donmar Warehouse, out go the lights.
I suspect that this is Friel deliberately running away from the political
tension he has built up. The best parts of Translations are not about
imperialism, but rather slow changes over time, especially in relation to
language: that includes local place names, which the English want to
standardise.
Nor is the play particularly anti-British. Some of the young Irish actually
want to learn English, if only for emigration to America. The more educated
Irish can speak English anyway; it is just that they regard Ovid in English
translation as sounding plebeian.
Yet while the play has its defects, it has some marvellous moments. Friel
bows to Shakespeare in allowing a young English officer to communicate with
an Irish girl in spite of the language barrier. 'Say anything at all,' says
Zara Turner's Maire, 'I love the sound of your speech.' Tony Rohr's
Homer-loving layabout believes in his cups that he has received a proposal
of marriage from Pallas Athene and is seeing her father, Zeus, tomorrow.
More seriously, Norman Rodway's Hugh goes into a discourse about endogamy or
marrying within the tribe. He gives the word in Greek. It is a mild relief
that he appears to accept exogamy - marrying outside the tribe - as well,
but clearly it is the exception not the rule. Until Friel backs away, the
message is that it is dangerous to truck with the English - almost, in other
words, 'Troops Out]'
The refurbished Donmar Warehouse is setting high standards. Translations is
directed by Sam Mendes and there is an austere, wet hay-smelling set by
Johan Engels. It fits the barren atmosphere; the only child mentioned in the
play dies in infancy.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Rix rattles the Arts Council - An explosive
resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has started soundings in its search for a new chairman of the
Arts Council to replace Lord Palumbo next April Fool's Day. Rumours suggest
that the usual suspects have been rounded up, including former arts minister
Lord Gowrie, who is not fully stretched these days as chairman of Sotheby's
Europe, Sir Nicholas Goodison, an unregenerate arts committee man, and Mary
Archer, who would be an acceptable token woman.
But the government's task in filling this unpaid job with endless
opportunities for nights at the opera has not been made any easier by the
explosive resignation this week of Lord Rix (former actor Brian Rix) who for
seven years chaired the Council's Drama Advisory Panel and its Arts and
Disabilities Committee.
Lord Rix was not mealy-mouthed in explaining why he was quitting. 'For more
years than I care to think the Arts Council has been viewed with barely
concealed contempt by successive Arts Ministers as well as by our clients.'
He goes on to accuse the Council of 'fawning' if it receives a reasonable
grant from the government, and when, as this year, there is no real
increase, behaving 'like lemmings, devising fatuous so-called policies, and
strategies, and visions, and corporate plans which are merely feeble
attempts to cover up the fact that we have been defecated on from a great
height.'
As a seasoned farceur his timing was spot on, prompted by last week's report
by consultants Price Waterhouse into the workings of the Arts Council. 'Two
things really got up my nose', he says. 'Their recommendation to cut back
the number of panel chairmen and regional arts board directors on the main
Council, and the suggestion that the Council should not go in for social
engineering. If the arts are not in the business of social engineering, what
are they for?'
Behind the specifics is a more fundamental trigger for Lord Rix's outburst.
He thinks that the Council has allowed itself to become a football of the
government. It should have re-examined its role and future itself rather
than submit to an investigation by outside consultants. He feels that
through apathy the Council has made itself dependent on its paymaster, the
Heritage Minister, and has surrendered the cherished arm's-length principle.
One can understand his anger. For years the Council seems to have been
churning out reports - on devolution, strategy, internal organisation, as
well as specialist working papers. Various arts ministers have played pass
the parcel with it: some, like Richard Luce, favouring devolution of its
powers to Regional Arts Boards; others, such as David Mellor, basically
wanting to make the funding decisions for major clients personally; or, like
the current incumbent, Peter Brooke, adopting a laissez faire approach.
Lord Rix has a point over the changing attitudes towards 'social
engineering.' To a great extent the Council has responded to its bosses.
Luce wanted more attention paid to women in the arts, Renton was keen on
cultural diversity, Brooke on disability. Their wishes were slavishly
followed. Now Price Waterhouse turns all this on its head and says that the
Council should return to a mainstream role as advocate of the arts.
Of course Brooke can ignore the report. But he seems committed to the Price
Waterhouse option of letting the Council carry on much as it is but saving
Pounds 850,000 a year by cutting 30-odd jobs, and by putting out such
activities as touring to a separate agency.
A dispassionate observer may feel that for all the the government's huffing
and puffing very little has changed at the Arts Council. Most of the reforms
amount to little. After 14 years of Conservative government it remains an
entrenched bureaucracy, the arms-length principle still largely intact. It
has lost some powers through devolution, but that was very much its own
policy pronounced in the 'Glory of the Garden' initiative of the early
1980s.
The new chairman's main concern will be money. After three years of generous
treatment by the government, which has raised the Council's grant by 27 per
cent to Pounds 225m, the cash flow is due to be switched off. In the face of
a planned cut of Pounds 5m in its grant for 1994-95 the Council intends to
announce in July that it will make strategic arts decisions - instead of
shared misery it will divert money away from devolved regional theatres and
towards contemporary dance and the visual arts. In the event little more
than Pounds 1m or so will be transferred, and although some arts
organisations will suffer and claim they face closure, they will probably
survive.
The real fight over money comes when the government confirms the Arts
Council grant in November. Secretary General Anthony Everitt is 'very glum',
and fears that the Pounds 5m cut could become Pounds 10m. New chancellor
Kenneth Clarke likes jazz but is not often seen in the Covent Garden crush
bar, and Peter Brooke shows little enthusiasm for asking for more. The
winter may be full of horror stories about bankrupt arts companies.
A new chairman will be courted with promises that the structure of the Arts
Council has been sorted out, and that there is an exciting new plaything,
the national Lottery, to administer. But these plus points will seem less
attractive if the long anticipated cash crisis in the arts finally arrives
just before he comes into his inheritance.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Better times at the Fairs - Off The Wall / A good week
at Grosvenor House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the more diverting scenes of an English summer is to watch the queue
of millionaires snaking outside London's Grosvenor House waiting for the
doors to open for the private view of the annual Antiques Fair.
Why they are in such a frenzy is hard to imagine. Are they really fighting
over Constable's 'The Wheatfield', on offer at Agnews for Dollars 6m; or the
life-sized statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Country Seat
priced at Pounds 54,000; or a rare signed Book of Hours of 1310 that Sam
Fogg is selling for Pounds 300,000? Well, yes, actually. The first man into
the Fair rushed to the stand of new exhibitor Grace Wu Bruce and bought a
Ming folding chair for Pounds 150,000. He was one of the many Far Eastern
dealers and collectors in the throng, which was encouraging for the
exhibitors since this is the the region that seems set to dominate the art
market in the foreseeable future.
First stop for the Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Hong Kong buyers in town
was Eskenazi's new gallery of oriental art in Clifford Street ,where his
exhibition of 'Early Chinese art from tombs and temples' was nearly cleaned
out on the first day when 28 of the 48 items were sold, including four each
priced at over Pounds 1m. By Thursday he had sold 32 objects valued at more
than Pounds 10m.
Oriental art still attracts traditional western buyers, too. So while a
Japanese museum paid over Pounds 1m for a bronze and silver ox of around 350
BC, a marble votive stele of around 450 AD went to the Cleveland Museum for
Pounds 1.3m. The grave goods that orientals are loath to buy, such as Tang
horses, have western fans, such as the American collector who acquired one
for over Pounds 1m.
The first reactions from Grosvenor House dealers was that business this
year, while still sedate, was a little brisker than last. Down the road at
Olympia there was a surge of optimism when first day attendances clocked in
40 per cent higher than last year. Then came the hot weather, a falling off
in numbers and a return to reason, but even so on Monday, when dealers
re-stocked stands for the final six days, chairman Leslie Weller reckoned he
supervised the biggest inflow of antiques since 1988.
Trade is definitely picking up, but as one dealer who has just completed his
financial year complained: 'My turnover is 20 per cent higher but my profits
are still non-existent'. Buyers know they are in the driving seat.
There are more signs of better times. The William Weston Gallery sold 24 of
its 27 Matisse etchings in two days, and at this week's auctions, while
there is little interest in the mundane, the exceptional fetched good
prices. Sotheby's had its best total, Pounds 6m-plus, for a sale of
Victorian pictures, and disposed of an Alma-Tadema for Pounds 1.4m. It also
managed Pounds 925,500 from a Chinese bronze food vessel, and Pounds 496,500
yesterday from a Louis XV secretaire by van Riesenburgh.
And yesterday Christie's put the cap on an encouraging week with a Victorian
picture auction which brought in Pounds 5.8m and was 91 per cent sold. It
set a new record for Alma-Tadema - Pounds 1.65m for his spectacular 'Roses
of Heliogabalus', as well as artist records for Waterhouse, Strudwick,
Meteyard and Marcus Stone. At last it looks as if the worst is over for the
art world.
* * * Down at London's Chelsea Harbour something is stirring at last. The
place is being invaded not by shoppers, or diners, but by sculptures. The
most important sculpture exhibition in the country for almost 20 years has
brought 60 installations to the site, including works by Glynn Williams,
Elisabeth Frink, Allen Jones, Lynn Chadwick, Michael Kenny and more.
The massive exercise is being underwritten by P &amp; O, developers of the site.
It has put up Pounds 250,000 towards the cost, making it one of the largest
one-off sponsorships. As well as attempting to resuscitate Chelsea Harbour
the exhibition is also lifting the Royal Society of British Sculptors off
the floor. This distinguished body had fallen on hard times, with membership
lapsing to under 200 working sculptors. Now an energetic president,
Philomena Davidson Davis, is turning it round.
The Canary Wharf show includes works by sculptors who should join the RBS -
and might if its revival continues. Most of the pieces are for sale at
prices ranging from Pounds 6,000 to the Pounds 160,000 for a jeu d'esprit by
Niki de Saint Phalle.
Compared with our morose painters, and their bleak vision, sculptors tend to
be jolly people who are working well. Glynn Williams, head of sculpture at
the Royal College of Arts, reckons all his 18 new graduates this year will
be gainfully employed as sculptors, even if most of their commissions come
from overseas. In total the output of UK sculptors has been valued at around
Pounds 400m a year.
Most of the work goes overseas. But there is a revival in outdoor sculpture
in the UK. The biggest commission in London, three sculptures, valued at
Pounds 250,000, to decorate the approaches to the Limehouse Link road to
Docklands, has just been unveiled. All told there are now more than 40
pieces of public art in Docklands, and you can trace them through a new art
map.
Last week the Art in the City Sculpture trail opened in the City of London,
and this week the Arts Council-British Gas Working for Cities awards were
announced, in which the Art in Public Spaces prize went to the Wakefield
Cathedral Precinct. Contemporary art may be hitting its head against a brick
wall of popular indifference but sculptors, who have moved beyond the
abstract, seem to be more in harmony with the public mood.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Chaos, crowds and comedy - Venice Biennale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE times, even now, when one is proud to be British. To find oneself
at Venice, with the temperature nudging into the 80s and facing the
prospect, courtesy of British Airways, of a week or so in the clothes one
stands up in, is not one of them. The errant bags turned up the next day,
with their absence unexplained but at least intact. Your correspondent is
once more his usual dapper and imperturbable self.
Not that that happy state has been a little difficult to maintain. The heat
and humidity are trying enough, 'but the noise, my dear, and the people.' In
spite of the public avowal by the director, Achille Bonito Oliva, at his
London press conference that this, the 45th Venice Biennale, would be ready
in time, it has proved so far the worst organised of any in my experience of
the last 20 years.
The central sight and focus of the Biennale are the public gardens at the
far end of the city proper. There beneath the trees are the many national
pavilions that make up so engaging an account of the architectural progress
of the century. There, too, is the maze-like central pavilion that houses
the principal thematic surveys of recent international art. And so, in the
avenue before the gates into the gardens on the first of the three press
days, the comedy begins, just as it has begun on the first day of every
Biennale.
We, the world's art critics, want to get in, and they, the guardians of the
gates, young earnest men with walkie-talkies, and a handful of armed
carabinieri who lend a certain tone, do not want to let us in until the last
possible official moment. Fully-loaded cameramen are climbing everywhere
above us to catch it all. Only this year the wait goes on and on, long after
the promised hour. The sun beats down. Tempers shorten. Fists are raised.
Things are said.
People had been going in all the time, of course, if they had the magic
words to whisper, or pass to show. Then there came the wonderful moment when
the dam broke. I suppose some 50 got through, , before the gates were closed
again by force, rather like the gates of Hougoumont at the battle of
Waterloo. We too managed to break in, to our immense satisfaction, in a
diversionary raid on the side gate.
And so into the gardens, to make a start on the pavilions and exhibitions
and to face the perverse ordeal of accreditation, which means another crush,
another endless wait, and more hard words and lost tempers. This year the
catalogue is in short supply, can hardly be had for love or money, and when
at last achieved it weighs a ton. You cannot imagine the desperation, the
sheer panic of the critic denied his catalogue.
The next few days will bring receptions here and gossip there, things to be
seen, conclusions to be drawn. Francis Bacon in the city, the young artists
in the Arsenale, Richard Hamilton in our pavilion - such things await a
thorough notice. The Biennale is under way again, and for the moment it is
enough to lean on the balcony of the British pavilion, high above the
gardens and the throng, a cooling glass on hand. Being British does have it
moments after all.
William Packer will write about the Biennale on Tuesday and Saturday next
week.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Elusive Ghosts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS NEW account of Ibsen's Ghosts is nearly, so nearly, a classic. The play
works beautifully in the close surroundings of The Other Place, and the
performance shines with vintage RSC virtues. Every facet has been honed for
meaning, the actors play as a true ensemble, voices are handsomely produced
with a wide, musical range of nuance, and the designs are unobtrusively
attractive. Why then is the production less than ideal? Partly because of
two vintage RSC flaws: where the casting is perfect, the acting is not
always spontaneous; and where the acting is spontaneous, the casting is not
always perfect.
Set against these cavils, however, is the thrill of Ghosts itself. Above
all, it is about the choices - past, present, future - that tragically pin
down a woman who has married without love. She spends most of the play
breaking through one trap, only to meet a worse one.
Jane Lapotaire should be wonderfully cast as Mrs Alving. Every aspect of her
is turned into expression and character. You see the hopeful girl she was,
the sharp old woman she is becoming, and the severity and sorrow that have
shaped her. But why so much calculating (and sometimes melodramatic)
emphasis? Why repeat the same odd right-arm gesture of entreaty, the same
gaping mouth of dismay, so often? Why the pregnant pauses, the sobbing
break-up of sentences into disparate staccato words? Too much artifice.
The only artificial feature of Simon Russell Beale's Oswald is his
blonder-than-blonde hair. Tensely cool with Manders, respectful but guarded
with his mother, he reveals the angry young man in Oswald. But his
embittered air of disillusion - invaluable in roles from Thersites (Troilus)
to Richard III - rids Oswald of his idealism. Two months ago, a young actor,
Jonathan Wrather, played this role at the Palace Theatre Watford, with less
revealing detail but the kind of Montgomery Clift nervous intensity that
swept the play up into a thrilling near-apotheosis. When Beale asks for 'the
sun . . . the sun . . . ', I am gripped by the shocking dullness of his tone
 -yet I cannot believe that sun is what he wants.
But expecting to find a flawless performance of a major Ibsen role is like
looking for a garden without weeds. Each character is so multi-dimensional
that it presents an actor with a supreme challenge. Manders, for example, is
more gullible and slow-witted than John Carlisle shows. In every other
respect, however, Carlisle is exemplary. He reveals Manders's morality from
several sides - the blinkered Calvinist rigour, the tender, grave idealism
(which attracted Mrs Alving), the insensitive rectitude that renders him
eventually laughable. And played with utter ease.
John Normington's Engstrand is a plausible crook. Alexandra Gilbreath's
Regina is radiant, servile and pushy - a marvellous mix. Vikki Mortimer's
designs and Tina MacHugh's lighting, beautiful in themselves, entirely serve
the play. Katie Mitchell, always a master of intimate space, directs the
play as a powerful web of eloquently interacting details.
At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until July 24 and later in the
season.

THE SECOND instalment of Sony Classical's Glenn Gould Edition is if anything
even more consistently treasurable than the first, which appeared last year.
True to its principle of comprehensiveness the new batch of discs includes
Gould's second recording of the Goldberg Variations made in 1981, 25 years
after the version that first established his reputation and which has
already been included in the CD edition. The later account remains, though,
the consummate achievement, one of Gould's finest performances, in which his
astonishing powers of articulation and control are harnessed to a view of
the variations that holds structural coherence, contrapuntal rigour and
poetic expression in perfect balance.
The other Bach here is the collection of Two-Part and Three-Part Inventions
assembled in the mid 1960s. If alongside the Goldberg they seem plain,
unadorned, much more confined in their tonal range and expressive potential,
they represent nevertheless a vital aspect of Gould's creative thinking,
which held that the bare essentials of Bachian counterpoint were to be just
as highly regarded as the grandest organic conceptions.
With Gould's pair of Brahms discs the common ground between performer and
listener becomes a little less firm. He was a pianist who was congenitally
incapable of being uninteresting, but sometimes his illogicality and
wilfulness are hard to follow. Among poised, lucid accounts of some of the
pieces here are strange, unexpected discursions  - the central section of
the first of the Op. 10 Ballades (recorded a few months before his death in
1982) slowed down almost to a standstill, the the E flat Intermezzo from Op.
117 made so prosaic that all its poetry seeps away, the B minor piece from
Op. 119 full of ripples and flurries, with the pianist's omnipresent
crooning more intrusive than usual.
The eclecticism of Gould's repertory is represented by Hindemith and by his
magisterial version of Liszt's transcription of the Pastoral Symphony. This
becomes Beethoven filtered through the sensibility of two keyboard giants to
emerge as an exploration of modern piano texture and figuration which only
Gould, among the pianists of our time, could make so fascinating and
revelatory. Hindemith is the other unfashionable favourite here; the three
piano sonatas receive muscular, committed performances. Winning would not be
the word I would use describe this music, but Gould's accounts come as near
as any interpreter could to making them seem like vitally important works in
the 20th-century piano literature.
Alongside such eccentric brilliance Maria Joao Pires' collection of three
Mozart sonatas could seem plain fare indeed. There is nothing startling or
unconventional about her playing; it is not the supremely elegant style of
Mozart interpretation which makes Mitsulo Uchida's Mozart sonata cycle so
enduring, but something altogether more straightforward and ultimately
endearing. It is, though, skilled, highly sophisticated playing, full of
careful grading and shading and with a punctilious correctness about its
rhythmic shaping. Nothing is pushed too hard, there are no specious claims
to profundity; the music emerges naturally and easily.
In the Beaux Arts Trio's integral set of Schumann's piano trios the piano
playing of Menahem Pressler takes pride of place. Indeed Pressler's
propulsive, brittle approach gives the familiar Beaux Arts character to
these performances, which may not be ideal (the account of the D minor Trio,
for instance, cannot hold a candle to the famous version that Rubinstein
recorded with Heifetz and Piatigorsky) but which in works that are too often
neglected are much more than simply serviceable. The tone of violinist
Isidore Cohen has got wirier and less supple over the years, that of the
cellist Peter Wiley is less assertive than that of his predecessor in the
group Bernard Greenhouse. But the energy of the playing is unmistakable and
the surge it gives to Schumann's melodies hard to gainsay.
Finally a curiosity. The irrepressible Mahler enthusiast and scholar Gilbert
Kaplan has sponsored and produced a realisation of four piano rolls made by
his hero for the new Welte-Mignon system in 1905: the songs 'Ging heut'
morgens uber Feld' and 'Ich ging mit Lust durch einen grunen Wald', the
fourth movement of the Fourth Symphony and the opening movement of the
Fifth. The disc also includes alternative versions of the three vocal items
with solo vocal lines added by the soprano Yvonne Kenny and mezzo Claudine
Carlson.
On this evidence Mahler was not a great composer-pianist; the performances
are full of scumbled passage work and muddy figuration. But they do give an
uncanny sense of his energy as an interpreter; his tempi are generally
faster than those of conventional performances today, and he seems to have
obtained emotional weighting through contrasts of mood and dynamic much more
than by languorous expressivo. The realisations have been carried out
immaculately; for Mahlerians this is doubtless an essential issue.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Records: Jazz new and old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS entirely appropriate that ECM's 500th production should be from Jan
Garbarek, the label's foremost exponent of its often gloomy, usually thought
provoking, European contemporary music. After the disappointment of the
Norwegian saxophonist's last outing, the soprano sitting uncomfortably
alongside the North Indian classical music of Ustad Fateh Ali Khan (Ragas
and Sagas), Twelve Moons is a welcome return to form and the old group.
Where he seemed starved of oxygen on Ragas, Garbarek burns bright here, set
against the luxurious rhythm section of Marilyn Mazur's mixed percussion,
Eberhard Weber on electrobass and the sparkling synth confection of Rainer
Bruninghaus. Compositions rooted in Norwegian lore or based on the music of
Edward Grieg are the unlikely soundscapes for the leader's searing
declamation: the ululating vocals of Agnes Buen Garnas and Mari Boine, the
extraordinary and emotional accompaniment. Jolly it isn't, uplifting it is.
When I first put American Keith Jarrett's new ECM disc Bye Bye Blackbird
into the slot, I was convinced a mosquito had become trapped in the speaker
cabinet. Several minutes into the title track I thought that comedian Jerry
Lewis had joined the pianist's trio for some kind of zany scat routine. If
Jarrett's piano playing is at its potent best here, so is the vocal
accompaniment. Do not be too alarmed, the absent minded squeals do abate a
little later to reveal an empathetic tribute to the late Miles Davis. The
Standards Trio of Jarrett (piano), Gary Peacock (bass) and Jack DeJohnette
(drums) recorded this session shortly after Miles Davis died but held back
the issue until the public mourning had subsided. In not a maudlin way, the
trio reflect on 'the sound which came from silence' with Davis favourites
such as 'Straight no chaser' and 'I thought about you', around the yearning
joint composition, 'For Miles'. Quite apart from its value as a testament to
a chapter in jazz history, Bye Bye Blackbird gives a seductive yet 'clubby'
view of Jarrett outside the introspection of the solo performance.
The American drummer Paul Motian is an important but much underrated figure
in modern jazz who has shed new light on the work of others - notably Monk
and Bill Evans - in recent releases alongside tenorist Joe Lovano and
guitarist Bill Frisell. Paul Motian and the Electric Bebop Band finds his
usually suspended drumming technique brought down to earth for some bracing
bebop standards and 52nd Street themes. Flanked by the choppy guitars of
Brad Schoeppach and Kurt Rosenwinkel, the elastic tenor of promising
newcomer Joshua Redman fronts the band through classic bop tunes such as
'Darn that dream' and 'Shaw-nuff'. This is accessible Motian at his most
interesting.
First among the re-releases is a splendidly annotated three disc anthology
from Ella Fitzgerald's years under Norman Granz. The release of Verve's
First Lady of Song which coincides with her 75th birthday, contains little
new for the dedicated fan in its 51 tracks. As a sampler for the almost
sacred 'Songbook' sessions, however, it is essential listening. Through
Gershwin, Porter, Berlin and Ellington, the cut glass diction and natural
musicality make Fitzgerald the perfect medium for these composers. All
aspects of Fitzgerald are here too. From the number that started it all, the
easy swinging 'A-tisket A-tasket' via the hilarious muffed vocals of 'Mack
the knife' to the transcendental scat of 'It don't mean a thing', this is an
essential purchase for those without the works.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Records: Nostalgia goes pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL HARDY

<TEXT>
FOR REASONS that probably will always remain unclear, the record industry
has redefined 'nostalgia' as a marketing concept that is exclusively applied
to the music prior to the emergence of rock 'n' roll. It is as though to
have fond recollections, let alone knowledge, of Fats Domino is to have a
good memory - but to remember Al Bowly is to be a dinosaur. What would
Victor Meldrew think about that?
The passing comet of rock 'n' roll that put paid to the dinosaurs of old,
however, did not eliminate nostalgia. Indeed, nostalgia has become an
important element of the re-issue market, not least because a number of
companies have taken advantage of the fact that sound recordings over
50-years-old are out of copyright. Anyone can re-issue them, if they can
find clean versions of the originals to copy. The trick, of course, is to do
them properly. One such company is Avid which has just released a quartet of
CDs featuring classic interpretations of the songs of Irving Berlin (Berlin
Always AVC 517), Cole Porter (You're The Tops, 518), George and Ira Gershwin
(S'Wonderful, 520) and Jerome Kern (Yesterdays], 519).
All are worthwhile, particularly because the selection of performers
surprises as well as touching the obvious bases. The Kern, for example,
features Fred Astaire, Jessie Matthews, George Gershwin and Billie Holiday.
Even better is the Gershwin, which includes Al Jolson singing 'Swanee',
Coleman Hawkins performing 'Lady Be Good', Fats Waller's version of 'I Got
Rhythm' and Paul Robeson's impassioned 'Summertime'. The CDs all have a
discreet note to the effect that the recordings are vintage performances
made prior to modern recording techniques. Nonetheless the clicks, scratches
and surface noises one remembers are missing. The tapes have probably been
(sympathetically) cleaned up. Certainly the recordings have an appealing
brightness.
Pavilion Records is another company that specialises in re-issuing vintage
recordings. Recent releases on its Flapper label include Arthur Tracey's Our
Favourites (PAST CD 7006), Al Bowly's Just a Bowl Of Cherries (7003), Gems
of The Music Hall (7005), George Formby's Favourites (7001), Mr Music Master
(7004), a selection of performances of songs by Hoagy Carmichael, and Paul
Robeson (7009).
The Al Bowly, a selection of rarities, is for collectors only, but the rest
are of wider interest, if one is willing to endure a few crackles and hisses
 -Pavilion takes the view that authenticity is preferable to tampering with
recordings. Like the Avid recordings, the Carmichael set mixes the classic
(Mildred Bailey singing 'Rocking Chair') with the odd (Nat Gonella's version
of 'Georgia on My Mind'), while the Formby and Robeson include virtually all
their major hits. Particularly interesting (but also particularly scratchy)
is the Music Hall collection which features classic performances from Harry
Lauder ('I Love a Lassie'), Marie Lloyd ('Every Little Movement'), Florrie
Forde ('Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly') and Billy Williams ('When Father
Papered The Parlour').
Of the major companies, EMI has been the most active in the nostalgia field.
Its most interesting series has been the . . . By Night CDs. Built on
memories of foreign travel and the growing awareness of the fact that there
are non-English language popular music traditions, EMI plundered its
world-wide catalogue to great effect. The earliest albums took us to Paris,
Rome and Berlin and introduced us to Piaf, Tino Rossi and Dietrich. So
successful were they that EMI has put out a compilation of these, The
Continental Collection (7 894602). But even more exciting are the latest
offerings, Buenos Aires By Night (789180 2) and Rio By Night (789036 2). The
first features classic tango performances by the original recording artists
(Josi Basso's La Cumparista) and the second a rich mix of the musical
heritage of Rio De Janiero. Moreover, because EMI has access to the clean
copies of the originals, they sound magnificent.

AS THE rouble plummets, any musical organisation in Russia that has forged
Western links must be humming a happy tune. The country's industry may be
out-of-date, unable to compete, but when it comes to selling the arts
abroad, the old-style Russianness of what is on offer counts as tradition
and that is very marketable.
Probably the most prestigious, certainly the most successful at wooing
Western interest, has been the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg. In a
wide-ranging interview in next month's Opera magazine the Kirov's Artistic
Director, Valery Gergiev, outlines the full extent of his business plan,
including regular visits to the West and joint productions with Western
opera-houses.
In particular, a record contract with Philips has produced a series of
recordings of opera and ballet, one of each new this month. To opera-lovers
in Britain the Kirov production of Prokofiev's War and Peace (by the British
producer Graham Vick) will already be familiar from a live BBC broadcast.
The intention was to bring it to Covent Garden, but that is now on hold -
ironically because of financial constraints at the British end, not the
Russian. The CDs must suffice, at least for a while.
And a fine substitute they make. There is only one serious reservation,
which must be mentioned at the outset. The recording was taken live at the
Maryinsky Theatre, a handsome building and with an acceptable acoustic, as
far as I recall; but that is not how it comes across here. There is no life
to the sound at all. Everything is deadened, as though heavy velvet curtains
have been hung around to soak up the top and bottom frequencies.
Fortunately, Gergiev is not aiming for a showy performance. He is not given
to melodramatic gestures; he does not milk the score for emotion as
Rostropovich did in his recording. Instead, the opera acquires a tenderness
and a depth of feeling that do not necessarily come easily to it. I found
that the shortcomings of the sound quality ceased to matter as the opera
began to work its spell.
The cast includes some of the best Russian singers who have yet to make an
impact on the international stage. Alexander Gergalov and Yelena Prokina
make a youngish-sounding and touching couple as Andrey and Natasha. Gegam
Gregoriam, a singer with a good chance of making his mark in the West as a
Verdi or Puccini tenor, gives a vivid portrayal as Pierre. Kutuzov's big
patriotic hymn to the Russian people asks for the grandest of Russian
basses. Nikolai Okhotnikov is unfortunately not that, but he brings some
spirit to the piece. I was surprised to find this important solo sliced in
half in one rival recording. Gergiev performs the score without cuts and the
whole opera is fitted economically on to three CDs. The booklet, in four
languages, is splendid.
A better sonic advertisement for Gergiev and his orchestra comes with the
set of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Strangely enough, this was also
recorded at the Maryinsky Theatre, but not (one imagines) with an audience
present or with the orchestra in the pit. The sound is richer and more suave
this time. Appropriately so, for now it is clear how cultured are the Kirov
players - no piercing brass or straining violins in the familiar Russian
style here - and Gergiev himself, as conductor. The whole performance
presents the ballet as an aristocratic divertissement, with upper-class
playing to match.
A pair of new discs from Vladimir Ashkenazy features another conductor of
Russian music who does not easily give in to hysteria. The Stravinsky is an
appealing programme, conducted with a spring in the step that makes the
rhythms dance, but the playing of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra is not
sharp enough. The wind chording, for example, is never quite together.
Perhaps it was untimely that I received this disc shortly after hearing the
orchestra's Berlin Philharmonic compatriots in Stravinsky's Rite of Spring
at the Royal Albert Hall.
The Shostakovich is a more interesting prospect. This disc couples the
composer's two final works for the voice, written in the mid-1970s as death
beckoned. Previous recordings of the Michelangelo Suite have been by
growling Russian basses, all dark, implacable, unrelieved gloom. Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau, in what must be one of his last recordings, comes from a
very different background and turns the music round to look out on a world
of tenderness and half-remembered sensuality, a mellower vision of old age.
He shouts too much in the sarcastic Captain Lebyadkin songs, but those are
only a brief, pithy addendum to the disc.
The two EMI recordings are both of big symphonic showpieces. At least, that
is how Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra deal with Shostakovich's
Fifth Symphony. To judge from this proud display, the strength and richness
of the Philadelphia strings are as remarkable as ever. Even without a
conductor as bold, as wholehearted as Muti, one suspects they would dominate
the performance. As it is, Muti plays the game and makes his points with
magniloquent gestures, even when keeping up the momentum might have been
preferable. This is Shostakovich with panache and a high gloss finish.
In the Fifth Symphony of Prokofiev, Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra do not have that route available to them, for better or
worse. There are times, especially in the slower music, when one wishes that
the ensemble might be tighter, the rhythms more decisively pointed, but the
overall view of the symphony works well. Rattle never overplays his hand and
has the good sense to tap the Adagio's bitter-sweet appeal without excessive
indulgence. How many recordings there must be of these symphonies by now] -
a bountiful source of export earnings, if only the Russian orchestras can
get their hands on it.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Books: From pilferer to playwright - The extraordinary life
and reputation of Jean Genet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENET by Edmund White Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 25, 820 pages
IN THE exhibition Paris Post War: Art and Existentialism 1945-55 that opened
earlier this week at the Tate Gallery there is a portrait of Jean Genet
painted in 1955 by his friend, the Paris-based, Swiss-born Alberto
Giacometti. The painter and the writer had both been adopted as significant
manifestations of the spirit of Existentialism by Jean-Paul Sartre and
Simone de Beauvoir. In 1952 Sartre wrote a book about Genet aimed to
canonise him as a secular saint of the movement - Saint Genet, comedien et
martyr. It was an attempt through a series of paradoxes to justify Genet's
criminal way of life as an example of supreme courage.
In 1954 Sartre published a major article on Giacometti in which he praised
Giacometti's art more soberly than he had Genet's. He pointed especially to
the sense of distance between the spectator and the subject Giacometti
created in sculpture and in portrait painting. This is noticeable in the
Genet portrait in the Tate.
Observing this portrait, it is difficult to believe that the strong stoical
figure it depicts was once a French borstal boy, a petty thief with
convictions running into double figures, a vagrant over much of pre-war
Europe and a male prostitute. Like Sartre's tome, the portrait celebrates
the transformation of Genet from being all those things in his youth to
becoming in his maturity a French writer of international stature, whom
several fine critics on both sides of the Channel and the Atlantic think it
is appropriate to speak of in the same breath as Proust.
How was this transformation effected? And is the claim that Genet's place
belongs among the truly great really valid? Edmund White's vast but never
otiose biography deals with the first question in the greatest detail,
giving us a fascinating answer based on many years of research. As for the
second, although he is not concerned to argue the literary critical case for
Genet as such, he leaves us in no doubt by his treatment of the works in
relation to the life - the early volumes of autobiographical fiction as well
as the later and much better known plays - that he regards Genet as being,
after Proust, the most important modern French writer.
White's task was made the more difficult by Genet's consistent disregard for
truth in the ordinary sense of the word. He was a compulsive liar, a
fantasist when giving any kind of account of his early life. With infinite
patience White has sifted truth from fabrication. Jean Genet was born in
1910 to a father about whom nothing is known beyond his name - Genet - and a
22-year-old unmarried mother who abandoned her child when he was seven
months old. He was then fostered to a family in the market town of
Alligny-en-Morvan in the Niere. The couple loved Genet as if he were one of
their own. They instructed him in the tenets of their faith, made a choirboy
of him and sent him to the local primary school.
Genet usually came top of the class and on merit should have gone from there
right up through the system, but for a boy of Genet's background, a welfare
ward, it did not work out quite like that. Instead he was given the option
of going to a training centre near Paris offering courses in printing and
cabinet-making. After two weeks he had run away and started that pattern of
truancy, theft, recapture, rehabilitation and recidivism, that marked his
early life from then on.
There were periods when he lived as a young tramp, followed by sojourns in
various psychiatric clinics for juveniles, and a brief but educative period
as assistant to a blind composer of popular music from whom he embezzled
money entrusted to him. In the end Genet landed himself in a situation which
not even he with all his street-wise cunning could wriggle out of. He was
sent to 'the children's prison' of Mettray, an agricultural penitentiary
colony. The great theme of Genet's work - domination and submission - in
everyday life, in sexual relations, in hierarchical masturbation fantasy,
was nurtured at Mettray.
The two and a half years Genet spent there, before he joined the army from
which he eventually deserted, were later glorified by Genet as the time when
he learnt to live entirely on his own resources. Even from his fictional
accounts - in Miracle of the Rose and The Thief's Journal - it sounds like
hell on earth. The older boys brutalised and raped the younger ones. Yet
Genet managed to do an amazing amount of reading under these conditions.
Leaving Mettray concludes Act One of his life.
In Act Two he emerges as an outsider in society, a writer of poetry and
prose pilfering to make ends meet, nicking books from shops and open stalls
that he rapidly re-sells. He becomes the passive lover of a number of young
men from the criminal class. He impresses the educated people he meets by
the range of his reading, the apercus of his conversation and his dandyism.
As the second war looms he is excited by the trial of a murderer with whom
he sympathises
Now Genet starts to lever himself into the Parisian literary world. By the
time of the Occupation he has made contact with Cocteau, who was at the
height of his passion for Jean Marais. Cocteau befriends Genet and is
crucial in the promotion of his early works. If Cocteau was ambivalent in
his behaviour towards the German authorities during the Occupation, Genet,
in his loathing of the French bourgeoisie, positively sympathised with the
Nazis.
After Jouvet's production of The Maids in 1947, Genet's gifts as a
playwright whose work was balanced on a knife-edge between fantasy and
reality took off in The Balcony, The Blacks, The Screens. Though few in
number, these plays, with their brilliant use of ritual, put him in the same
league as Beckett, Brecht, Pirandello. Genet became the centre of an
international post-war cult. He no longer needed the protection of anyone.
His blazingly original and frankly obscene prose books were a landmark in
the history of gay liberation. Yet while he was granted an official free
pardon for his former crimes, he still needed to steal. While in
Giacometti's studio, for instance, he took away a drawing the artist had
done of Matisse. Bursts of creativity alternated with long periods of
isolation and hibernation abroad.
Even now, with all the acclaim, Genet remained deeply subversive. He
supported the Algerian Arabs against the French colonialists and then became
a champion of the Black Panthers and the Palestinians. He witnessed the
massacre at Shatila in Lebanon and wrote movingly about it. In his last
book, Prisoner of Love, he identified with those peoples searching for a
homeland. White gives an interesting account of the later works, film
projects and scripts.
Unlike Proust, Genet has yet to find a translator into English who will give
him the readership outside France that he deserves. This remarkable
biography will arouse fresh interest in his work as a whole and make us
realise that there is much more to Genet than the plays that are already
regarded as modern classics.

<TEXT>
THE SILENT CONSPIRACY by Stephen Dorril Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 521 pages
WITH exquisite timing, the British Security Service (MI5) has moved into a
new, hideous headquarters on Millbank just as it has become all too apparent
that Boris Yeltsin's Russia is no more capable of posing a threat to the UK
than it is of conducting its own affairs.
Yet it is an historically demonstrable fact that Soviet Russia has always
been regarded by MI5 and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police as an
enemy of Britain. Those in Britain who have, or are alleged to have had,
overt or covert sympathy for Soviet Russia have been regarded in the same
light as committed supporters and traitors.
Stephen Dorril therefore argues that MI5 and the Special Branch are now
planning to concentrate their energies on closer investigation than ever
before of the lives and beliefs of British citizens, in order to persuade
the government that their tasks remain unchanged despite Soviet Russia's
demise. Terrorism in its many forms, with Northern Ireland the scene for
prolonged undeclared war, will justify greater activity, not only by MI5 but
by the other civilian and military agencies which operate there. The
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the Postal Services and
British Telecom will seek to penetrate ever more closely into private lives.
Dorril's Big Brother world is described soberly, and with abundant
corroborative material. Dorril has also worked hard to sustain the thesis
which complements his account of MI5's and the Special Branch's
determination to survive at all costs. Dorril states not only that the Cold
War is over but that 'it is debatable whether terrorism poses a real threat
to the realm.' Therefore, there is no longer any need for MI5 and its
associates. Dorril is clearly convinced that this simple assertion requires
no evidence to support it. Given such a conviction, Dorril finds no
difficulty in arguing that MI5 and the Special Branch manufacture crises and
distort the terrorist factor in order to strengthen what he calls 'the
secret state'.
Linking issues which should be treated separately is a device much employed
by conspiracy theorists, and Dorril is no exception. He has, however,
striven so hard to sustain his case against MI5 and the Special Branch that
the issues do emerge in terms which enable two key questions to be asked: do
we need security services, and are these services so anxious to convince
their political masters of the existence of new threats to the realm that
intensified interference with ordinary British citizens occurs almost
without check?
The first question can be bluntly answered in the affirmative. All Dorril's
denials cannot alter the fact that a major terrorist threat does exist to
the lives of just those ordinary citizens about whom he professes such
concern. When people get blown up or maimed, and when evidence emerges that
the Provisional IRA is not the only terrorist organisation operating in the
UK, the thoughtful reader could well decide that the author represents a
generation which lacks direct experience of an ugly world. Yet Dorril not
only calls the Provisionals 'terrorists' but applies the word to others,
notably those who perpetrated the Lockerbie massacre. Dorril also states
that 'with substantial arms supplies from Libya the IRA will always be able
to mount operations.' There is much mental confusion here.
Nevertheless, and coming to the second issue, Dorril does have a
constitutionally and politically very important case in exposing the degree
to which our lives are under surveillance, and on a scale which poses a
specific threat to civil liberties. The Police Review, hardly a journal of
the left, provides Dorril with an apt text regarding surveillance
operations: 'Much of the information is valid intelligence. A substantial
proportion is unchecked bunkum.' Searching further back in time, Dorril
finds Erskine May criticising the Special Branch: 'The freedom of a country
may be noted by its immunity from this baneful agency.'
If therefore there is nothing new about the secret British state, Dorril has
still done good work in giving examples of unwarranted interference with our
lives; justified on no possibly valid security grounds; apparently
controlled by recent legislation; yet exonerated in practice by governmental
authority in terms which could well have been laid down by Sir Humphrey
Appleby.
In the event, therefore, Mr Dorril has put it in his debt. The security
services are necessary, but require urgent overhaul and Parliamentary
oversight. Attention John Major, our populist prime minister. While he is
about it, Mr Major could do worse than take a close look at 'private
security organisations,' as they tend, euphemistically, to dub themselves.
Some of these firms are perfectly proper and have saved lives rather than
taken them. But all merit investigation - by Parliament, not by some
neutered Whitehall committee.
The case for investigation is clear and straightforward: the electronic age
enables all kind of folk, well intentioned and otherwise, contracted,
covertly, to 'government' or not, to poke and pry. Orwell's frightening
vision is coming closer to realisation, not because of 'the secret state'
mentality but because it is now all too easy to dig deep into another's
private life.

FIGHTING ALL THE WAY by Barbara Castle Macmillan Pounds 20, 626 pages
BARBARA CASTLE was the Labour Party's Margaret Thatcher, or should have
been. They have different beliefs and Mrs Castle never even became party
leader, let alone prime minister. Yet in character and background they have
a great deal in common. Even in their politics they have a shared suspicion
of the European Community.
Mrs Castle's misfortune was to have been born too early - four years before
the outbreak of the first world war. There was never a chance that a woman
could make it to the very top in her generation, especially in the Labour
Party. When she was seeking to become a parliamentary candidate in the early
1940s, an old trade union hand told her bluntly: 'Women won't vote for
women.' Still, it is possible that Mrs Castle's pioneering in one party made
it easier for Mrs Thatcher in another.
Barbara Betts, as she was born, owed a lot to her father, who worked for the
inland revenue but was also a socialist intellectual who wrote poems. The
north country family was not well off. Like Margaret Roberts from Grantham
she went to Oxford at a time when that was relatively unusual for a girl
from a poor background. With her customary flexibility, Mrs Castle believes
that once women had achieved equality - such as being allowed to speak at
the union and have wine at dinner - there was no need for mixed colleges.
The length and depth of her political training are remarkable. After what
she regarded as the shame of an Oxford third, she went in for party
propaganda, being proclaimed in Ashton-under-Lyne as 'a unique phenomenon -
a woman wot speaks'. She knew most of the leading figures in the party early
on and wrote a joint column in Tribune with Michael Foot. She was already a
figure at party conferences, and had even called for limiting the trade
union block vote, before she entered parliament in 1945. Almost at once she
became a parliamentary private secretary to Stafford Cripps, then to Harold
Wilson.
Those were the liberal days when a PPS was allowed to vote against the
government. By 1950 she was a member of the party's national executive
committee. Probably her closest political ally was Aneurin Bevan, who she
thinks would have had a healthy influence on the left had he not died in
1960. Mrs Castle disliked Hugh Gaitskell intensely, and in the long period
of Labour opposition spent much of her time working with the Movement for
Colonial Freedom - a fascinating part of her memoirs.
Much of the rest of the volume is more familiar, from not only her own
diaries but also those of her colleagues: Wilson, Crossman, Healey, Jenkins
and Benn. She was the first minister for overseas development to be in the
cabinet; the (non-driving) transport minister who introduced seat belts and
breath tests; then she came a cropper with 'In Place of Strife' when
ultimately only Harold Wilson supported her attempts to reform trade union
legislation. She left office completely when Wilson was succeeded as prime
minister by James Callaghan, a man whom she plainly disliked as much as she
had Gaitskell.
Still, some insights are new. She was not conventionally left wing and she
has a nice turn of phrase: on Tony Benn - 'I had an uneasy feeling from time
to time that something was not quite in focus.' She says that her own view
about the Labour Party is like that of the present Bishop of Durham on
Christianity - 'continuing to assert the faith while shedding those
doctrinal elements which no longer seem appropriate.'
I did not know that Mrs Castle wanted to be foreign secretary when Labour
returned in 1974, but that is what she claims. On her desire for the
premiership, she is quite open, yet honest enough to recognise it was not
within her grasp. She never schemed for it. Perhaps her most surprising
characteristic was her total hostility to the European Community in the
years when Britain was seeking to join. There was a mild conversion when she
became a member of the European Parliament in the 1980s, but a pro-European
Castle earlier on might have tilted the balance in the Labour Party.
With these memoirs Mrs Castle is back with the Healeys and the Jenkins which
is where she belongs. She leaves no doubt of her admiration for Mrs
Thatcher's determination, but must be pleased to have got in first. Lady
Thatcher's memoirs are due in the autumn.

HUNTER by E Jean Carroll Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 341 pages
LIKE IT or not, it is difficult to avoid Dr Hunter S Thompson. Only recently
Garry Trudeau devoted another of his 'Doonesbury' cartoon strips to the
latest episode in the extraordinary life of Duke, the drug addict, quondam
diplomat and Colorado recluse who is modelled on the self-styled 'gonzo'
journalist.
There have been at least three biographies of the man in the last year or
two. For those who keep track,E Jean Carroll's is the one by the author who
actually slept with him and nearly married him. This is not bad for a
character who has produced only one seriously good book in 30 years (Fear
and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, a brilliantly idiosyncratic account of
the 1972 election) and is considered even by his fans to be one of the most
disappointing literary talents of his generation.
Ms Carroll's technique is clever. Every third chapter or so gives an account
of her own 'romance' with Thompson, written in the best Vanity Fair/Tom
Wolfe style, deliciously revealing, funny, and self-mocking. The rest is a
series of quotes from family, friends and enemies, from Louisville,
Kentucky, via the Hell's Angels and political writing to the Colorado cabin.
Thus she begins: 'I have heard the biographers of Harry S Truman, Catherine
the Great, etc etc, say they would give anything if their subjects were
alive so they could ask them some questions. I, on the other hand, would
give anything if my subject were dead. He should be. Oh yes. Look at his
daily routine: 3.00pm rise: 3.05 Chivas Regal with the morning papers,
Dunhills. 3.45 cocaine: 3.50 another glass of Chivas, Dunhill: 4.05 first
cup of coffee, Dunhill: 4.15 cocaine: 4.16 orange juice, Dunhill; 4.30
cocaine; 4.54 cocaine . . .'
Eventually you get the picture, through the 7pm lunch at the Woody Creek
Tavern (Heineken, two margaritas, two cheeseburgers, fries, tomatoes,
coleslaw, taco salad, fried onion rings, carrot cake, ice cream, bean
fritter, Dunhills, another Heineken, cocaine, and for the ride home a glass
of shredded ice over which is poured three or four jiggers of Chivas.) At
9pm he 'starts snorting cocaine seriously'; at midnight, fortified by
Chartreuse and pornographic movies, he is 'ready to write.'
Or not, because it is a long time since Hunter Thompson has written
anything. But there is no point in being po-faced about this. To write may
be to disappoint: to be Hunter S Thompson is to be a weird kind of icon.
Dick Goodwin, an old friend and intimate of the Kennedys, says: 'Hunter
Thompson is a unique character of our times. He is a reality, which is one
thing. And he is a symbol, which is another totally different thing. And
thirdly he's both ultimately sane and crazy. He is also drunk and sober'.
Carroll, with the deftest of touches, offers the most entertaining of reads
with, correctly, an absence of moralising. Other minor literary characters
should be so lucky.

<TEXT>
LIFE'S DOMINION by Ronald Dworkin HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 272 pages
LA Rochefoucauld said that death, like the sun, should not be stared at.
Ronald Dworkin does not take his advice. In this outstanding book he
addresses the agonized problem of death inflicted, by choice, in the form of
abortion and euthanasia, his aim being to elucidate what is truly at stake
in this confused and acrimonious debate that surrounds the matter, and to
suggest ways of resolving the difficulties it involves.
Dworkin is the world's leading philosopher of law. In this book he shows
that complicated questions can be discussed with originality, profound
insight and utter clarity. He takes his readers from courtrooms and hospital
wards to the most abstract considerations of the sacredness of life and the
exigencies of law. By the book's end one senses that the whole shape of the
debate has been transformed. From now on there can be no discussion of
abortion and euthanasia which does not start from here.
Abortion means deliberately killing a developing human foetus, and
euthanasia means giving, out of kindness, an easeful death to a sufferer.
Both arouse great controversy and passion. Dworkin describes the furore
currently raging over abortion in America and Europe as the modern
equivalent of the 17th century's wars of religion.
In Dworkin's view much of the debate's bitterness stems from a serious
mistake about what is really at issue. Most participants argue as if the
main dispute is about interests and rights. Their rhetoric is framed in
terms of a foetus's interest in staying alive, and its right to be protected
by the community in order to do so. But Dworkin argues that what actually
underlies both the 'pro-life' and pro-abortion positions is a view about
something different: namely, the sacredness or inviolability of life. Both
parties, he says, believe that life has intrinsic value; but each takes a
different view of what that implies for personal and political decisions
about abortion. The same considerations apply to euthanasia.
The concept of the sacredness of life is not an exclusively religious one.
Atheists also regard life as sacred in Dworkin's sense. By 'sacredness' here
is meant intrinsic value and importance. This is not the view that life's
worth is such that the more we have of it the better, for clearly
overpopulation is a disvalue. But once an individual life exists it is
hugely important for its own sake. Consider a painting by Leonardo: the
destruction of such a thing would be regarded as a terrible loss, not merely
for the instrumental worth it has in pleasing or instructing us, but because
of its own special value as a high achievement of human creativity. How much
more valuable still, Dworkin says, is human existence itself.
Each human life therefore commands respect for its own sake, because of what
goes into its making and what its possibilities are. To end such a life is
to frustrate its possibilities and to waste its value. For conservative
opinion, this implies that abortion is never, or very rarely, justified. For
liberal opinion, abortion is justified whenever the continuation of a
pregnancy would have an especially bad effect on other lives by frustrating
or wasting them, or would result in a deeply frustrated life for the child
itself if it were born. But for both sides of the argument the central issue
is the merit of life itself.
The same thoughts apply in the case of people suffering incurable and
perhaps agonizing disease or injury. Recently in Britain a doctor was found
guilty of attempted murder for giving a lethal injection to a woman
suffering so much pain that she screamed whenever touched. In Dworkin's view
the question of life's value to the sufferer is the central concern here. In
the Netherlands there is a tacit understanding that doctors can help such
patients die peacefully and quickly provided certain guidelines are
observed. Elsewhere, many sufferers are condemned by our scruples to lives
which are terrible to live. Dworkin devotes a chapter to the problem of
Alzheimer's patients, a growing population of sufferers with suffering
families who, until medical science finds a rescue, undergo a long and
frightening living death. Their plight throws the question of life's value
into stark relief.
In the book's central chapters Dworkin brilliantly applies these ideas to a
careful account of the practical and legal questions at the heart of
contemporary controversy. For his own part he favours the liberal line in
permitting abortion and euthanasia whenever the case for them is cogent. But
his expressed hope is that redefining the debate as one about the best way
to respect and protect life considered as intrinsically valuable - as
'sacred' - will help to relax the ferocity of opposition between the
debate's warring parties. It should, he says, help to bring both sides
together to see that their disagreement is at bottom a spiritual one; for if
a tolerant society can embrace differences of religious and political views,
why should it not do so in regard to the question of how best to respect
life's sanctity?

FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel Books: Tall tales from the yurts of subterfuge - Why
travel writers are economical with the truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS tell such lies.
Out on the grasslands, at the border between inner and outer Mongolia, I was
introduced to my first nomad yurt. Under its cosy felt roof I enjoyed an
unbelievably disgusting and drunken lunch of mao tai, millet seed, mare's
milk, ewe's butter, camel curd and boiled dissected sheep. I thought I was
in paradise.
But did I confess that I had shared my meal with a party of Hong Kong
Chinese tourists, that my host the herdsman was a trusty of the local
Communist Party, and that the yurt had been erected just for the day?
I did not.
Years before, visiting Tashkent, I took photographs of smiling Uzbeks in
lambswool caps selling their colourful wares in the peasant market. That
night I watched a cabaret in which pale Slav girls in fishnet tights and
toppers danced under strobe lights. Did I keep quiet about it?
I did.
Travellers omit any fact that interferes with their prestige or tarnishes
the fantasy that binds the narrator to his audience. The humblest tourist is
economical with the truth. He writes fibs on his postcards home. His
snapshots dutifully reflect the brilliant scenes - beaches, mountains,
castles, ruins - of the holiday brochure that sent him abroad in the first
place. He is forced into elaborate subterfuges like the great Kurosawa, the
Japanese epic film-maker whose lens could not stray above roof height for
fear of catching the telephone lines strung across his mediaeval
battleground.
In some quarters, even Marco Polo is still accused of inventing his 17-year
sojourn at the court of Kublai Khan in Peking. His revelation that the
Chinese kept themselves warm by burning black stones was, however,
vindicated when coal made its appearance in Italy.
Why do travellers lie? Because they pine for an exotic primitive world
which, in all but the remotest regions, has passed away and survives only in
the minds of freeloading travel-writers, coffee-table cameramen and
television scriptwriters. This is the fantasy the tour operator sells: you
won't find photographs of the Everest climbers' garbage dump in his
Himalayan travel pack, nor of Nepalese mountain tracks decorated with scraps
of lavatory paper left by previous trekkers.
We all have our travel fantasies, of course. Mine, like I do not know how
many thousand of others', began at the age of eight while reading Heinrich
Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet. Later, John Buchan's Greenmantle took me,
along with the impossibly daring Sandy Arbuthnot, behind the mysterious
shutters of the Turkish bazaar.
But it was China and Central Asia that took the greatest hold. A beautiful
godmother who lived in the Peking embassy and dined with Chairman Mao sent
me a set of green china horses and figures of sages and peasant fishermen.
Sir Fitzroy Maclean pushed the window further open by travelling the Turkish
railway and writing about it in Eastern Approaches. I learned Buddhist
prostration techniques from Henning Haslund's Men and Gods in Mongolia and
followed the extraordinary missionary ladies Mildred Cable and Francesca and
Eva French on their wagon train through the Gobi. But it was Peter Fleming,
crossing the Taklamakan desert with Ella Maillart in One's Company, who
finally did for me.
For nearly 20 years I nursed my complaint before the opportunity arose to
scratch my Central Asian itch. Disillusionment followed hard on the heels of
wonder. Yet there were rewards: among them, encounters with the Living
Buddha of Huhehot and the sole surviving imam of Ashkhabad, a solitary view
of the devastated Tangut necropolis in the desert of Ningxia, a scramble
over the mound that was the Parthian capital of Nissa, and a day (secured
only after a week's badgering of a forked-tongue Soviet commissar) in the
withered mudbrick remains of Merv, razed by the Mongols in the early 13th
century.
The only travel writers for me are the ones who are not afraid to paint the
whole picture - telephone wires and all. Peter Fleming, inventor of the
witty anti-travel book with Brazilian Adventure, ranks among the very best.
He has his heirs. One, although of a more cynical turn, is Paul Theroux.
Another (with whom I have travelled myself) is Andro Linklater: his Wild
People of the Sarawak longhouse were religious animists who wore 'I love New
York' T-shirts.
I would trust almost any title from the house of John Murray, publishers of
Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle and of Patrick Leigh Fermor and the late Freya
Stark. Their latest comes with the reliable name of Hopkirk on the cover. It
is A Traveller's Companion to Central Asia by Kathleen Hopkirk, wife of
Peter whose Foreign Devils on the Silk Road and The Great Game are
compulsory.
Hopkirk (to whom I owe the reminder of Marco Polo's impugned veracity)
acknowledges a debt to Sir Fitzroy Maclean and has raided her husband's
library to produce a short alphabetical history of the best bits of the old
Silk Road. She covers Ashkhabad, Bokhara, Geok-Tepe (where the Tekke
Turcomans were slaughtered by the Tsar's army), Gilgit and Hunza, Kashgar
(including a delightful portrait of the first British residency), Khiva,
Merv, Samarkand, Tashkent, Tunhuang, Turfan and Urumchi.
Her book is undoubtedly as reliable as anything extant on Central Asia. For
the addict, of course, it is one more dangerous dose, a tickle for itchy
feet, an invitation to seek fresh surprises in central Asia following the
collapse of the Pax Sovietica.
A Traveller's Companion to Central Asia, by Kathleen Hopkirk; John Murray,
Pounds 16.99. 290 pages.

THE BATTLE FOR ROOM SERVICE by Mark Lawson Picador Pounds 14.99, 291 pages
TRAVEL WRITERS are a competitive lot, forever flinging themselves in search
of the exotic, the perilous or the obscure. Mark Lawson, on the other hand,
appears to be a gentle soul and, for a journalist, an honest one - a
self-declared tourist and coward who has nursed, all his life, a profound
need to put himself in the presence of safety.
As a result, his latest book is subtitled Journeys to All the Safe Places -
New Zealand, Australia, Middle America, Alaska, Canada, Luxembourg,
Brussels, Switzerland, Milton Keynes, Disneyworld, Expo '92 and Center
Parcs.
As he says, courage is normally what publishers want. Yet commissioning
editors, comically unaware of his wimp status, seemed only too happy to take
him out for pleasant lunches and then, over the sambucca, to suggest he go
there on a camel, or here without a map, or into such and such a territory
with only two pairs of knickers and a tube of Polo mints in his rucksack.
Lawson fended them off. What he wanted to write about was the quiet world -
places of tranquillity, stability and conventionally civilised values. 'I
stress this,' he says, 'because the idea somehow got around in a few of the
countries I visited that this project was an examination of the world's most
boring countries. Untrue. If such judgments must be made, I prefer to follow
the modern practice of linguistic sensitivity, or political correctness, and
refer to these destinations as 'activity-challenged',
'differently-interesting', or 'places of calm'.'
He claims that his journeys had the ghost of a serious purpose: to discover
whether there was such a thing as a safe country in a way philosophically
beyond the definition of one in which nothing much currently goes on. 'Could
the Ayatollah Khomenei have produced in the inhabitants of Timaru (New
Zealand) or Ottawa or Milton Keynes the reactions he won from those in
Tehran? Lenin lived briefly in Zurich but, had he been Swiss, could he have
led a revolution there? Do some nations have anaesthetic temperaments and
environments which render them immune to demagoguery and revolution?'
Lawson sets about his mission in splendid style, by starting in New Zealand
and having some harmless fun with the Kiwi accent. When he tells a hotel
receptionist in Christchurch that he is heading for Timaru, she tells him
that the people in Timaru are 'funny little pipple.' Why? asks Lawson. 'Hard
to say,' she replies. 'We had a nuclear accidint in Ni Zilland in '64, and
pipple reckon something got into the water over there . . . '
He also produces some appalling yet lovely jokes. Example: New Zealand is
'probably the only country in the world in which people flocked to see The
Silence of the Lambs believing it to be a public information film about
oesophageal blockage in new-born sheep.'
But there is more to Lawson than quips about accents and bitter-sweet jokes.
He does his homework. He has a good ear and eye. He is a rewarding companion
and guide. And his humour is always studiously unforced.
After a year spent in the quiet world, Lawson concludes that the safe zones
are receding, that there are no islands any more - no opt-outs, anywhere,
from poverty, joblessness or, most strikingly, some variety of violence.
Perhaps, he says, it was no coincidence that in each of these former oases
of stasis there was also a crisis of belief in leaders. In the year in
question, in nearly every nation of the quiet world except Australia, a
leader had been retired, rejected or in some way humbled, partly because the
prevalent political pressure to reduce taxation had left these countries
struggling to fund the lifestyles to which their electorates had become
accustomed.
History has not ended - not even in the boring world.

JOHNSON AND BOSWELL IN SCOTLAND: A JOURNEY TO THE HEBRIDES edited by Pat
Rogers Yale Pounds 25, 330 pages
TRAVELLERS, however jaded, usually see the need to enliven their accounts of
unfamiliar places with a sense of curiosity and excitement; their attitude
is the opposite of that affected by the Matabele emissaries, in Stanlake
Samkange's Zimbabwean novel On Trial For My Country, who have been told not
to 'keep on saying au] au] au] in amazement'. On seeing the sea for the
first time at Cape Town, one of them remarks simply: 'Ah] Today the river is
in flood'.
Dr Johnson, in remote regions, has no hesitation in exclaiming at
'mountains, waterfalls, peculiar manners; in short, things which he had not
seen before'. Johnson and Boswell in Scotland accentuates the drama of
travel by supplying two narratives to read alongside each other: Johnson's
Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775) and Boswell's Journal of a
Tour to the Hebrides (1785). While Johnson is busy observing 'peculiar
manners' and the like, Boswell is entertained and elated at being able to
view his thoroughly urbanised friend and mentor in an unaccustomed setting.
The pleasures of this double narrative are evident when the travellers come
across their first Highland hut. Johnson is full of investigatory fervour.
Luckily, 'to enter a habitation without leave, seems to be not considered
here as rudeness or intrusion'. 'True pastoral hospitality' prompts the
peasant woman inside the hut to invite them to drink whisky.
As Johnson gathers information, Boswell is sharply aware of the social
comedy generated by the situation. His companion's interest in primitive
architecture prompts him to ask where the woman sleeps, and she answers
'with a tone of emotion, saying she was afraid we wanted to go to bed to
her'. Rather cruelly, they derive great amusement from 'this coquetry of so
wretched a being'; each claims banteringly that it is the other who has
'alarmed the poor woman's virtue'.
Some of the narrative tension of the book is, of course, derived from the
close - but intermittently combative - relationship between the two men.
Returning from the Western Isles, Boswell is overcome with apprehension, as
he anticipates the meeting between his father, Lord Auchinleck, and Johnson,
his surrogate father: 'I was very anxious that all should be well; and
begged of my friend to avoid three topics; Whiggism, Presbyterianism, and -
Sir John Pringle.'
Johnson periodically annoys Boswell (a lowland Scot) by his rudeness about
Scotland. At one point, he declares that, until the Union with England, the
tables of the Scots 'were coarse as the feasts of Esquimeaux, and their
houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots'.
Such analogies with far-flung regions are frequent, and not always
disparaging: once the two men reach the Highlands, they both excitedly
compare the scenes before them to the wilds of America. Boswell finds their
visit to one village 'much the same as being with a tribe of Indians', to
which Johnson replies: 'Yes, sir; but not so terrifying.'
The desire to leave dull familiarity behind is never expressed here quite as
strongly as it is in EM Forster's A Room with a View, when the heroine, in a
Florentine pensione, laments: 'It might be London'. Nonetheless, Johnson
seems gratified when his experience of feudal hospitality convinces him that
'the fictions of the Gothic romances were not so remote from credibility as
they are now thought'.
His pleasure in new and surprising sights is tempered by a vehement
repudiation of fantastic travel literature - the tales of monstrous beings
that proliferate in medieval travel narratives, and survive, in the 18th
century, in wild speculations about Patagonian giants and other curious
phenomena. Johnson opposes all such 'credulity', and is resolutely sceptical
about the poems of Ossian - works published by James Macpherson in the
1760s, in the guise of translations from a Gaelic epic.
Delight in novelty, moreover, cannot entirely deaden the awareness that 'to
live in perpetual want of little things, is a state not indeed of torture,
but of constant vexation'. Many contemporary travellers to the third world -
or to the English countryside on a Sunday - will sympathise with this
measured response to the absence of a shop on Skye.
In some other ways, Johnson's narrative may seem alien to late
twentieth-century readers: he feels none of the constraints of tourism,
which began to trouble travellers to Italy a few decades later, and his
Journey lacks any concept of a Byronic urge to move ever onwards, or to
place one's self-identity at risk. (Revealingly, he describes with approval
how, in ancient Gaul, Caesar came along and 'put a stop to' the engagingly
feckless plans of the Helvetians to wander off 'they knew not whither'.)
Boswell's narrative has more in common with contemporary travel writing,
simply because it often focuses on the personal feelings of the traveller
himself: he describes his fits of gloom, made worse by the experience of
being trapped on islands by bad weather.
Johnson, however, in his resolute pursuit of knowledge, touches on many
questions relevant to current debates about cultural difference. He is
scornful of the moral relativism that justifies any form of human behaviour
by showing it to be acceptable in some exotic region.
Montesquieu, for example, 'to support polygamy' tells you of the island of
Formosa, where there are ten women born for one man. The trouble with this
argument, Johnson cheerfully points out, is that 'he had but to suppose
another island, where there are ten men born for one woman, and so make a
marriage between them'.
Johnson and Boswell in Scotland provides immensely pleasurable reading; its
delights are increased by the thoughtful choice of illustrations, and only
slightly marred by the decision to cut Boswell's text, and supply the barest
minimum of explanatory notes.
Within the domains of literary criticism and of history, travel writing is
usually appropriated either by old-fashioned anecdotalists, snobbishly
preoccupied with the antics of aristocrats, or by proponents of the new
critical orthodoxy of colonial studies - which, as it becomes absorbed into
established systems of academic deference, is in danger of losing its
initial intellectual energy. Accessible and attractive editions of travel
writings, such as this, throw open the field to a wider readership, and
encourage a more diverse range of approaches.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Fishing Property: Angling for a piece of river - Tom Fort
muses on the possibilities of actually owning his own stretch of water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I occasionally run through the following conversation.
Fisherman One (myself); 'Oh, by the way, you must pop down to my water some
time.' Fisherman Two (impressed.; 'Your water?' F1; 'Yes, it's quite a nice
stretch. Nothing grand, of course, but there's usually a fair chance of a
fish or two'. F2: 'Well, that's jolly kind of you. Any particular time?' F1:
'Any time you like, my dear fellow. That's the advantage of having your own
water.'
My tone of voice in this - sadly imaginary - exchange is modest and
deprecating. But I would, perhaps, permit myself a certain emphasis on the
words 'my water.' They do have a pleasing ring to them; or rather, I'm sure
they would.
However, in common with the great majority of anglers, l do not have 'my
water'. Nor am l ever likely to. Nor, in my more rational moments, am I
entirely sure I would like it so much. Yes, it could be satisfying to lord
it over the less fortunate. But imagine if Fisherman Two, instead of
gratefully accepting the offer, replied:'Awfully decent of you, but to be
frank, nothing on earth would induce me to come to your water. It was never
much good in the first place, what salmon do make it end up in poachers'
larders, and - I know this hurts - you were done'.
But it is a fact that plenty of anglers with money do like the idea. And
what, above all, they want to spend their money is that diminishing,
threatened miracle of salt and fresh water, the Atlantic salmon.
Six years ago, I wrote an article for the FT about the value of Scottish
salmon fishing. Then it was shooting upwards towards heights which were to
be greeted with rage and disbelief by ordinary fishermen who found
themselves increasingly excluded, and with hand-rubbing delight by owners
and their agents.
The value of a given stretch of salmon river is computed according to the
number of fish caught on it, averaged over a five or ten-year period. In
1932, the value per fish was around Pounds 1500. So a beat with an average
catch of 100 salmon could be expected to change hands for Pounds 150,000. By
1987, when I did my survey, it had reached Pounds 5000 per fish. 1989 saw it
rocket above Pounds 8000. And by 1990 it had peaked in the region of Pounds
12,000 per fish (although there were instances on the Brora and the Beauly
when it went higher).
This dizzying appreciation transformed the traditional way in which salmon
fishing was organised, which by and large had been through decorous and
gentlemanly relationships between ancient families and long-established
tenants. if you wished to fish the Spey, the Tweed or the Tay, you had to be
the right sort and know the right sort, and be prepared to wait until a pair
of dead man's shoes became empty. Then the money arrived.
The owners of the estates through which the great rivers ran - always
hard-pressed for cash - found themselves sitting on assets which were
soaring in value. The old ways were abandoned as time share invaded; a
system of financial exploitation which made it possible for the worth of
those silver fish to be maximised to the last penny. Cash replaced social
connections as the key to this promised land.
It could not go one, of course. The recession came, then the Lloyds
insurance market disaster. Leisure spending was an early casualty, and the
decline in values and volume of business set in fast. Now a calm has settled
on the Scottish market.
The big deals are no longer being done. Take as an example the Ballathie
Estate, north of Perth; 1500 acres, with a hotel, two country houses, a
score of farms and 1 1/4 miles of prime double bank fishing on the Tay with
a 650 fish annual average. Two years ago Strutt and Parker offered it at
Pounds 10.5 m. Now it is down to Pounds 8m, and still there is no buyer.
The problem is that salmon fishing no longer seems to have obvious business
potential. The timeshare market is dead; unmourned by many, as its
associations of frenzied sales techniques and faulty Spanish wiring hardly
corresponded wIth the world of crusty lairds, monosyllabic gillies, and
effortless Spey casting. With the absence of any prospect of swift and
substantial return on investment, it means that likely buyers are restricted
to those doubly blessed with a true enthusiasm for the fishing, and a great
deal of money.
Roving south, to the trout of the chalkstreams of England, things are also
pretty quiet. Timeshare never established a grip on rivers like the Test,
the Itchen and the Kennet, and the fishing tends to be in the hands of clubs
or syndicates, or organised on a day ticket basis, with a few privileged
private owners dotted about.
The Test was once the finest of them all, and its fishing still commands
prime prices, even though gross and careless exploitation has ruined much of
it. The Itchen is a different matter, more cherished, more difficult, much
nearer to the true chalkstream ideal. It is rare for any of it to come on
the market, but Knight, Frank and Rutley is offering a gorgeous-looking 1
1/2 mile stretch of double bank fishing below Winchester. If I had somewhere
near Pounds 500,000 I would be round there like a shot.
A little way down the scale is Lambourn in Berkshire, a lovely stream much
afflicted by abstraction. Strutt and Parker has two tempting stretches
available, one of a little under half a mile at about Pounds 135,000 and
another, somewhat shorter, which goes with a large, luxurious millhouse and
15 acres at Pounds 650,000.
What I think I would like best of all - were my circumstances to undergo a
considerable change - would be some fishing in Ireland. It has salmon rivers
as good as Scotland's, and trout rivers better than England's. It was hardly
touched by the salmon boom, the value per fish never rising beyond Pounds
2000. The problem with Ireland is that decent fishing almost never changes
hands and when it does, it is by word of mouth. But it can be done.
Finally, a cautionary tale, also from Ireland. A friend has a nice trout
river across the fields from his house. One year, when I was there, he told
me he had rented a mile or so at Pounds 50 a year. All for himself. I
quivered with envy as he rolled the words 'my water' around his mouth. A
while later, he told me that the woman with whom he had concluded his
agreement, and to whom he had handed his Pounds 50, had no more title to the
water than the Bishop of Galway. Such are the pitfalls.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Gardening: A climactic year of marvellous muddle - As his
garden rapidly blossoms, Robin Lane Fox is already planning his strategy for
late summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOWERS have run riot and gardens are on an all-time high. I cannot remember
such a year or such a week. If you dither you will miss it, like all such
peaks, and will end up wondering what it all meant. Quite simply, everything
has come to a climax at once and I have never seen the equal in 35 years'
hard gardening.
In the old Tory heartlands, gardens used to peak between June 20 and July
10. The heartlands are becoming wetlands, but the change is not the reason
why the calendar has been brought forward. A cold, wet May delayed plants
which had been brought to the threshold by the mild winter and favourable
spring. The recent sunshine has been like a trigger, setting off the
late-comers and bringing the front-runners into early flower so that both
have collided.
I see the evidence all along the big double borders of my Oxford college.
These are meant to span three phases but have run at least two of them into
a single, unprecedented show. Against the background of annual examinations
and academic stress, I have been walking contentedly down clouds of blue
catmint, delayed pink and white lupins, double white peonies, retarded
abutilons, accelerated mauve buddleas, clouds of pale purple thalictrum, and
day lillies which are a month ahead of themselves.
Among this extraordinary collision, there are irregularities which I do not
pretend to understand. Almost all of the old-fashioned roses have burst into
hundreds of flowers about three weeks before their usual date, while the
wild species seem to have obeyed their calendar and gone no faster than in a
normal season.
We have the extraordinary sight of midsummer roses - like the wonderful pink
Fantin Latour and the best of the pink and white albas - in full flower
beside the neat little clusters of Scots Burnet rose bushes which are
usually the prelude to the heavy French varieties later this month.
Meanwhile, the modern bush roses and hybrid teas seem to be following their
usual rhythm.
Is it, perhaps, that the old-fashioned varieties appreciate a mild winter
and have been brought into full bud by the first adequately wet spring for
three years? I cannot see other good reasons for the difference.
Meanwhile, the simultaneous show ought to be recorded in photographs. I have
never seen the old-fashioned forms of dianthus flowering profusely beneath
peonies which usually are associated with late May. Buddleias look
remarkably chic among dark blue anchusas which have been having a field day
among their new neighbours, the border campanulas of normal July.
My personal prize at home goes to a phygelius in full flower among the
silver-leaved saxifrages of late May, with layers of late June's campanulas
to keep the peace between them. It is like a dream and, even on the edge of
the thunderstorms, I cannot stop marvelling at it.
Climactic years bring problems with them, though. Traditionally, garden
tours and foreign visitors aim at late June or early July for the great
southern rose gardens like Sissinghurst and Mottisfont. If you have the
option, bring forward the visit to this weekend and next, because the roses
will have raced before you if you stick to the normal schedule.
As for colour planning, this season is making a marvellous muddle for all
the experts as well as the increasing flood of books on the subject since
publishers fastened on to it a few years ago. Those charts and diagrams
which suggest the right combinations have been thrown out of order by a
simple trick of the weather.
If you are setting out on a new garden, and feeling unnerved by experts'
insistence that particular flowers should be matched only with particular
varieties, remember that 1993 has turned the experts' suggestions inside out
and that nature has brought on its own combinations, usually for the best.
Oxford borders are enjoying rather more of a Blue Period than I had
intended, but I cannot say that premature nature has altogether ruined the
result.
Be sure to see this extraordinary climax in a great garden, somewhere; but
what, though, when it is all over? We need to look two months ahead, because
July will be an early hiatus and we cannot leave August to become a dead
brown flop. Thereafter, I will be using groups of blue, autumn-flowering
crocus, on offer from the best bulb merchants until late July.
Meanwhile, it is no use relying on retarded bedding plants from most of the
main shops.
Annual bedding plants are far ahead of their old rhythm and there is not
much of quality which has not been brought on and sold off already. Instead,
I am relying on cuttings and young plants of half-hardy perennials which
have more staying power and which can even be bought as late as the Hampton
Court flower show on July 5 and 6 without being too far behind to make a
serious show in late August.
I am referring to the daisy-flowered osteospermums, scented heliotropes,
bits of pink diascia, fragments of shrubby salvia, and other soft plantings
which companies such as Hopleys, Brian Hiley and Rushfields of Ledbury bring
to the summer shows and sell off to those with an eye for quick quality.
Give our gardens the slightest whiff of Maastricht and they seem to make a
continental dash for early growth. Over there in Europe, southern gardens
have to use the tactic of late summer perennials, bedded out in a second
sequence during late June. Now that we are going European in our seasons,
and the boring old calendar has lost its sovereignty, we will have to react
to this new paradise by adopting these secondary tricks and extending our
season by cunning.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Property: Wherever there's a polo field . . . - In spite of
the recession horsey pursuits are still popular, as Gerald Cadogan discovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HORSES are expensive luxuries, needing swathes of grass, special food,
shelter, tack, medicine, and clothes for themselves and their riders. And
when Lloyd's losses loom large, giving up equine pastimes is an obvious
economy.
Yet, horsey pursuits retain their popularity in Britain, in spite of the
economic downturn. And while prices for properties with stabling have
suffered in the recession, like everything else, the market for them will
survive so long as people race, hunt, jump, trek, play polo or drive
carriages.
It is not just Britons who are keen are such properties. Earlier this year,
Strutt &amp; Parker sold the late Jim Joel's stud at Childwick, Bedfordshire, to
the Swiss connections of the Portugese owner of The Fellow (the beaten
favourite in the Cheltenham Gold Cup). And John D. Wood reports that a
potential Italian buyer has just viewed Sylvandene in Surrey the top-notch
equestrian centre of David and Marion Mould. The guide price is Pounds
450,000.
Several stud farms are on the market. Christopher Stephenson, a specialist
in racing and bloodstock properties, and Woolley &amp; Wallis are offering
Woodminton Farm for around Pounds 750,000. This is under the downs west of
Salisbury, Wiltshire, and where Major and Mrs RB Kennard bred Cadeaux
Genereux and Smarten Up.
Stephenson also offers Jevington Place near Eastbourne, Sussex, at the same
price (down from an original Pounds 1.1m) with its acreage reduced slightly.
Its smart yards with 45 loose boxes, barns in Sussex-style knapped flint and
brick, paddocks with post-and-rail fencing, and position next to the church
make an attractive proposition. Another in Sussex is Burleigh Farm, near
East Grinstead and Gatwick airport. It has 21 acres and an immaculate and
practical six-box yard, offered by Jackson-Stops at Pounds 675,000.
Outside Newbury, Berkshire, Savills is selling the Woolton House estate with
its Woolton House stud. Among its winners is Supreme Court, which took the
first King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in the Festival of
Britain year (1951) in the colours of Vera and Thomas Lilley (of Lilley and
Skinner). After he died, she married Colonel Roger Hue-Williams. Theirs was
the heyday of the stud in the 1960s and 1970s.
The whole is priced at Pounds 3.25m, or is available in lots. The big house
(in one lot) needs work but would make an excellent base for racing and
entertaining, as it did for the Hue-Williams. The dilapidated subsidiary
house that goes with the stable yard (another lot) is an 1880s villa - a
potential delight if re-done completely.
Neither house is listed, which will make it easier to alter them, and both
have fine trees screening them from the road.
In Cheshire, the Rookery Park stud near Nantwich is on offer from Lamont
(with Stephenson) at more than Pounds 1m; it has 29 loose boxes and
six-furlong gallops. The house was built in 1987 in half-timbered style. In
Hertfordshire, Mullucks Wells (with The London Office) has the Blakeware
stud with 18 boxes and a listed Victorian Gothic building that used to be a
coach house. Price: around Pounds 695,000. For Pounds 100,000 less (from
Bedford and Savills) is the Tally Ho stud near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.
That is the price for the peach-painted Regency house and garden, but the
yard with 15 boxes is a further Pounds 185,000.
Idover House near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, with two yards and paddocks, makes
a good base for hunting with the Beaufort. Lane Fox offers it at around
Pounds 495,000. Near Cheltenham, the same agent has Rossley Manor, an old
Cotswold house with stable yard, grazing, and holiday cottages that produced
an income of Pounds 25,000 last year. The price without the cottages is
around Pounds 750,000. In the same region, Hamptons is selling Little Park
at Wootten Bassett in Wiltshire; this boasts a cross-country course built in
1990 by the same people who constructed the course at Badminton. The house
is 17th-18th century, with 262 acres, and the price (over Pounds 975,000)
includes a first-rate shoot.
In Hertfordshire, Coltsfoot Farm at Datchworth has six paddocks and 30
boxes, for around Pounds 495,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker. It could make a good
base for the growing practice of do-it-yourself liveries, where the box is
let out at a typical rate of Pounds 20 a week.
If your dream is a training yard, Lambourn on the Berkshire Downs runs
Newmarket a close second. The gallops are owned privately and maintained
superbly. Trainers pay Pounds 52.50 a month plus VAT per horse - racing on
the flat - to use them.
In the centre of the village, equestrian property specialist Pilgrim Bond
offers Bourne House, a 41-box 'town yard' (last used by Nicky Henderson) for
Pounds 350,000. On the edge of Upper Lambourn, Lane Fox has Charlie Brooks's
yard at Uplands, with 58 boxes, for around Pounds 850,000.
If dressage is what matters, Addington Manor near Winslow (of Great Train
Robbery fame) in Buckinghamshire is where Lady Inchcape has created the top
dressage centre in the UK. It is new on the market (from Strutt &amp; Parker and
Savills) at over Pounds 2.75m.
Another 'seriously rich' property in the county is Great Hundridge Manor
near Great Missenden, a Grade II house with 628 acres, 28 boxes and 10
paddocks for around Pounds 3.5m from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
But the top priority for many people is a paddock for the children's ponies.
Keep your eye on the local newspaper but expect to pay considerably more
than the usual prices for agricultural land - even Pounds 3,000-5,000 an
acre. Renting on a grazing agreement is likely to be Pounds 50-Pounds 60 an
acre.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Property: House price stability continues - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES continue to stabilise. At the bottom end of the market, the
Nationwide index of the average price of houses - for which the building
society give mortgages - shows a slight rise in May of 1 per cent, for the
third month in a row.
The Halifax index shows a 1.2 per cent decline. The figures are still 5.5
and 3.3 per cent down on May 1992, underscoring the point that any property
must be reasonably priced - in 1993 terms - to sell.
Buyers at the top end 'still want to be predatory', says Savills' Justin
Marking. They must feel there is some 'give' in the price. A house priced
too highly will deter viewers.
Vendors are starting to offer houses, he finds, two months later than usual
in the annual cycle. It took until until spring for confidence to pick up
and may mean that the early summer buying season will continue through the
August lull.
Another market indicator is the purchase by an overseas buyer of 4 St
James's Square in Mayfair, London, at close to the guide price of Pounds
6.5m freehold.
Conversion from business use to a house will cost another hefty sum. The
agents were Wetherell and Herring Baker Harris.
Built in 1725, the property was the home of Nancy Astor, Britain's first
woman MP, and then of the Arts Council, before becoming temporary law courts
and finally the seat of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. It comes with
garden and mews. In the mews are three cells and a slaughterhouse.
Green-minded readers looking for a place that is undeniably different should
visit what is virtually Britain's southern mainland limit, the Lizard, in
Cornwall.
The National Trust in Cornwall (0208-74281) is offering a 99-year lease on
the old signal station on Bass Point at over Pounds 85,000 (but no ground
rent) to buyers who will pay for the repairs.
Shaped like a Norman castle keep, Signal House looks out to sea on three
sides and was built in 1872 for spotting ships and communicating with them
by semaphore as they entered the Western Approaches.
Telegraph operators sent details of the vessels to Falmouth; from there,
they were forwarded to Lloyd's in London and to the owners, who could send
back their orders. This meant the ships did not have to put in at Falmouth.
By 1877, the station was dealing with more than 1,000 a month.
As a residence, it has four bedrooms, an observatory-landing and a rooftop
sundeck with complete privacy. But attitude is as important as price; the
Trust has battled to conserve the Cornish coast for many years and wants
buyers of like mind.
Attitude matters also at The Cottage in Charlton, near Banbury, a village
house which is being offered as a furnished let.
It has 10 bedrooms, three tennis courts and a panelled dining room modelled
on the senior common room of Merton College, Oxford, all put together by a
noted barrister and politician, Frederick Smith, who became the first Lord
Birkenhead.
The tenants must cooperate with his family on using the tennis courts and
holding the annual village fete in the garden. The guide rent on an assured
shorthold of three to five years is Pounds 30,000, to include some daily
help, a gardener and access to the estate.
Grazing, stabling and full livery for horses, a kitchen garden and rent of a
cottage are negotiable extras. Details from Lane Fox in Banbury
(0295-273592).
Across the road from Hampstead Heath in north London, Schreiber Developments
has just completed Temple Heath Lodge in Templewood Avenue; there are four
well-planned apartments on 125-year leases at around Pounds 1m (through
Goldschmidt &amp; Howland, 071-435-4404, and Savills, 071-431-4844).
The joinery of rare quality is right for a firm that began by making
furniture. The flats look over to the heath and the rich, red brickscape of
Hampstead's roofs.
Next door are Schreiber's offices, designed by James Gowan 30 years ago and
rated one of London's best post-war buildings.
Another distinctive 1960s building is Capel Manor House near Tunbridge Wells
in Kent, designed by Michael Manser for the site of a demolished Victorian
pile.
The house is a glass pavilion and sits on the arched terrace of the old
house, surrounded by a large, terraced garden of 3.5 acres brought back from
wilderness by landscape architect Bodfan Gruffydd. The rhododendrons and
azaleas are splendid. Jackson-Stops (071-499-6291) offers it at a guide
price of Pounds 385,000. Clearly, one for gardeners.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine or the grape: that is the question -
Another New World versus Old conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERENA SUTCLIFFE, head of Sotheby's wine department, was describing, at a
discussion over dinner with the CIVB, the official wine organisation of
Bordeaux, how difficult it is to persuade 'what I call The Ordinary Wine
Drinker' that he should drink basic bordeaux rather than Bulgarian Cabernet.
'I wonder', she asked, looking deep into the president's eyes, 'would it be
possible for you to put a bit more flavour into your wines?' The officials
dutifully took notes and presumably, after a few dozen committee meetings,
an instruction will be sent to the Entre-Deux-Mers region which provides so
much ordinary bordeaux: Hold the subtlety.
The French in general, especially the Bordelais, are feeling particularly
sensitive about competition from other countries at the moment - not least
because their wine exports have dropped for the first time in a decade. The
CIVB conceded one important point over this recent dinner in London. We
managed to convince them of the folly of their stated party line that
'Bordeaux should not be judged in the same league as New World wines . . .
the criteria used need to be different'. But they are determined to play
according to different rules from the New World.
French appellation officials have decided to ban the names of grape
varieties from wine labels. The theory is that once they start selling their
wines as, for example, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon instead of
Chassagne-Montrachet and Pauillac, then they agree to play the same game as
New World wine producers and throw away their trump card: geography, or
terroir. They are banking on the fact that, as far as geographical wine
names go, they are centuries ahead of the Americans and antipodeans in terms
of brand development.
But what is the most sensible way to label a wine? Until the perfect grape
variety is found for every plot of vineyard and all wine drinkers know what
that is (and we are a very long way from that), information about grape
varieties is genuinely helpful to the modern consumer, even if printed in
much smaller type than the name of the wine's provenance.
The French may find that their place-based naming strategy works in the long
term, but only if they are serious about improving quality in the lower
ranks, which they tend to translate directly as curbing yields. (And this
should certainly help to 'put more flavour' in the Entre-Deux-Mers wines -
although some parts of the region may be simply too cool to ripen red grape
varieties fully anyway.)
What would you surmise from the word Tarrango on a wine label, for instance?
This red in a burgundy bottle, new to Britain's shelves, may sound Latin
American, but in fact it is from Brown Brothers, a 104- year-old family
company based in the Australian state of Victoria.
A closer look at the italics under the 'Limited Production' stamped on to
the label (which sets one thinking about how many wines are available in
infinite quantity) reveals that TARRANGO is a new Australian grape variety,
designed to yield light Beaujolais-juicy reds for summer drinking. At Pounds
4.45 from Waitrose it seems a good buy to me, with lots of fruit, no tannin,
and something reminiscent of South African Pinotage about the aroma.
Ironically perhaps, this specially-bred vine variety has in fact been named
geographically, after a small township in Victoria.
The Bordelais may never feel seriously threatened by Tarrango, but the
sensible ones are monitoring closely (or even participating in) what is
happening just three hours down the autoroute in the Languedoc. Many of the
region's best buys are Vins de Pays labelled by grape variety, tolerated if
not encouraged by the French appellation authorities, but more and more
exciting Corbieres and Minervois appellation wines are also emerging.
DOMAINE DES PENSEES SAUVAGES is a small property in the rugged heart of the
Corbieres run by British emigres Nick and Clare Bradford. Mirroring what the
typical Brit thinks of English winemaking, I had never sought out the wine,
but a bottle of their regular 1991 tasted recently was extremely impressive:
subtle (the Bulgarians need lose no sleep), rewarding with food, and clearly
made from old vines with care and passion. The 1991 costs Pounds 4.50 from
Ben Ellis of Brockham, Surrey (0737-842160) which also has the 1991 Reserve.
The 1990 is just Pounds 4.75 from Abbey Cellars of Yeovil, Somerset (tel:
0935-76228).
The most useful bit of information on most wine labels is of course the name
of the producer. There are few producers who could persuade me to part with
Pounds 7 for a bottle ranked only as a vin de table, the lowest French wine
rank, but the small print on the label of LES COLLINES DE LAURE 1991 carries
the name Jean Luc Colombo, one of the Rhone's most energetic and
user-friendly oenologists. This excitingly vibrant red is made from his
Cornas vines too young to qualify for the strictures of the Appellation
Controlee authorities and offers a superior Syrah-with-a-story for drinking
this summer (Pounds 6.75 from Adam Bancroft, 4 -7 Great Pulteney Street,
London W1 071-434-9919).
This young Master of Wine specialises in Under-appreciateds, Eastern France.
His VDQS Cotes du Vivarais 1990 from MAS DE LA BEGUDE is staggeringly
powerful and ambitious for Pounds 5.58, and knocks spots off the average
supermarket Chateauneuf-du-Pape. A wine to be drunk or kept, but certainly a
name to be watched.
The name Denis Dubourdieu on a white bordeaux label should alert wine
insiders. LE SECOND DE REYNON 1992, Pounds 5.49 from Oddbins, is
marvellously fruity, an adjective all too rarely applicable to dry white
bordeaux in my experience, although 1992 whites are better than most.
Pomerol and Michel Rolland is another insider combination, and Oddbins again
have his well structured, full blown generic POMEROL 1991, in fact his
declassified Ch Bon Pasteur, at Pounds 7.99 which is also ready for the
dinner table.
Finally, evidence that the Spaniards at least are prepared not just to
countenance international competition, but to take inspiration from it.
Sainsbury's has the cleverly crafted, barrel-fermented NAVARRA
VIURA-CHARDONNAY at just Pounds 3.99, perhaps too oaky for some palates, but
a creamy full-bodied combination of one local and 80 per cent of another
distinctly international grape variety.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A passion for perfect cheeses - Giles
MacDonogh meets a woman on a serious food mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE THAN any other foodstuff, with the possible exception of meat, cheese
requires the most careful handling on the part of shops and supermarkets.
In the smaller supermarkets cheese presents a problem: swaddled in plastic
and kept at maturation-inhibiting temperatures, the cheeses are robbed of
any qualities they might have ever had. They might as well be used for
cooking, for as often as not, attempts to coax them back to life by keeping
them in a warm room fail absolutely.
Few things depress me as much as the sight of a secretary scurrying back to
her office from the local supermarket clutching a piece of 'Brie' (generally
from the Allgau in Germany); a cheese which has never ripened and which
never will, and which resembles in no respect the rare and remarkable
cheeses which are still made in the Brie province in north eastern France.
From the depths of the these black thoughts, it is wonderful to learn that
there are still a few people who feel passionately for 'real' cheese and who
are ready, even in these times of cheese-stifling health regulations, to
open a shop dedicated to the very best of European cheeses. One such person
is Patricia Michelson of La Fromagerie in Highbury, north London, a shop
which opened just two weeks before Christmas last year but which has already
proved the most exciting new cheesemonger to appear in the capital since the
launch of the Neals Yard Dairy in Covent Garden more than a decade ago.
This is not the first time that Patricia Michelson has come to the attention
of this page. A few years ago she started a wholesale business which she
operated from her garden shed.
This tiny, 10 ft square shop, however, has been her first chance to offer a
selection to the public as a whole. They have certainly taken her up on it:
as I sat interviewing her on a weekday evening, desperate cheese-lovers
scratched anxiously at the door. On a normal day she can accommodate them:
she is often open as late as 9pm.
The minuscule shop is already under sentence of death, as the authorities
want to turn the site into sheltered housing. Patricia is unworried. She
already has her eyes on another premises across the road, and once the
building work is finished she will get her old shop back, which she will
turn into a charcuterie, selling hams and sausages.
Even now La Fromagerie finds space for good bread (including the
tooth-shattering loaves of Lionel Poilane); Tuscan and Umbrian olive oils;
pulses; sun-dried vegetables; honeys; and delicious raw-milk butters from
Normandy and the Charentes.
She also has a wide selection of olives which she makes up herself using
recipes from around the Mediterranean.
Naturally the chief thing is cheese. Patricia was switched on to cheese by
skiing holidays in the Savoy where she met the great cheeses of
Franche-Comte as often as not made from the milk of the wonderfully named
Abondance cow.
French cheeses are her first love, but the shop has much more besides. She
is a hard woman to catch out: there are pungent, washed-rind cheeses from
Belgium; mountain cheeses from Italy; Dutch and Swiss cheeses; great blue
cheeses from the British Isles; all arranged in such a way as to encourage
their ripening, so that here, as in a great French cheese-shop, you may
stipulate the precise day on which you intend eating your cheese.
Nothing is bought from the London trade. The purchases are all made in the
country of origin. This ensures that many of these cheeses are available
nowhere else. Here are a few of Patricia's specialities:
Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) from Italy. The 'Stravecchio' or 'very old'
is a white, winter milk cheese of the sort valued in Parma itself (Pounds
9.30 per lb). This should be placed on the cheese board and not grated. For
grating there is a 1990 Parmesan (Pounds 7.30).
Asiago from the Veneto in Italy. This hard cheese is often confused with
Parmesan. It has a nutty flavour and a good tangy finish (Pounds 5.70).
Truffle cheese from Piedmont in Italy. This is half goats' milk and half cow
with a natural rind. This is a remarkable cheese with a very powerful
truffle aroma. Patricia thinks it is best crumbled over risotto or scrambled
eggs and eaten with a glass of champagne. It costs Pounds 16.60 per lb if
you want real pieces of white truffle, or Pounds 14.60 for the cheese made
with truffle-essence.
Beaufort from Savoy (France). This two-year-old cheese is Patricia's pride
and joy. The texture is already granular. This is a highly pungent cheese
and requires a good glass of wine (Pounds 10.40).
Bruzl from Belgium; a washed rind cheese of the Maroilles type. These
cheeses are not for the fainthearted. A similar cheese from Lille goes by
the name of 'Le Puant' (the stinker). Eat with real ale (Pounds 7.50).
Wensleydale from England. This cheese is made from half ewes' and half cows'
milk just outside the famous Dales region but using traditional techniques
which made the Dales famous (Pounds 6.10 lb).
Gabriel from Ireland. A cows' milk cheese made to a Swiss recipe. Very nutty
with a long finish (Pounds 7.50 lb).
Crottin de Chavignol from the Berry (France). Many Crottins are rather hard
by the time they get here, but this is young and fresh with a lemony
acidity. She has older cheeses if you prefer. Pounds 2.50 each.
La Fromagerie, 1A, Highbury Park, London (tel: 071-359-7440) is open
weekdays from 10.30 until around 8pm, and on Sundays from 10am-2pm. It
closes on Monday mornings.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Shanghaied by Chinese shrimps - Kieran Cooke
admits murder but claims there were mitigating circumstances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AVOID dark places. I never swim. In restaurants, I always sit with my back
to the wall, facing the door. A posse from POSS is after me.
POSS, the Protection of Shrimps Society, is deeply upset. My crime? Eating
shrimps. Live. While kicking and screaming, their little black ball eyes
still quivering. A trial has been called for. At the very least, I am in for
a ticklish assault by a thousand shrimps. It is not a pleasant prospect.
I plead guilty to the charge, but there are mitigating circumstances. My
crime was not premeditated. The shrimps forced themselves on me. There were
also deep confusions of language and culture.
It was in China - Shanghai to be precise. Lunchtime, and hunger is gnawing
at the system. A likely, if slightly scruffy, restaurant on the corner. I
navigate my way across the street. 'What', says the smiling lady of the
restaurant, 'would you like?' My Shanghai dialect is a trifle rusty. I try a
few words. A crowd gathers, trying helpfully to interpret. 'What is he
talking about - has he a pain in his stomach?' 'Now he's waving his hands
about. He's pretending to be a fish. Foreigners are peculiar.'
Finally, the light dawned, or so I thought. Yes, I would have the soup, the
fish, the dumplings and some rice. Everyone seemed overjoyed at this
linguistic breakthrough. Handshakes and eternal friendship pledged between
the Chinese and Irish peoples.
I sit back and wait.
The fish arrived, big enough to feed six, its gaping mouth stuffed
delicately with coriander and baby tomatoes. The dumplings were next.
Dumplings, or jiaozi, are something of a Shanghai speciality. Steamed or
fried, dipped in a little chilli, they slip down the gullet with consummate
ease. My stomach put up the green flag. All was well.
Some thin slices of pork followed, served on a bed of stewed jellyfish. Just
like eating rubber bands. Takes one back to one's schooldays. All remarkably
good. Some soup - made out of chicken broth with wild mushrooms. The amber
flag is going up. The stomach says it is reaching capacity. A gulp of the
local, very good, beer to stabilise things.
A traffic policeman sits down, wearily, at the next table. Poor man, he must
go home each night with a thousand bicycle bells ringing in his head from
Shanghai's 7m bicycles.
A covered dish arrives. A few heads turn to watch. I lift the cover. And
this is where the trouble with POSS started.
Inside the dish were about 50 small, dark-looking shrimps. Not just alive,
but doing trampoline exercises. Leaping and somersaulting all over. The
restaurant lady darted forward quickly and replaced the cover.
Shouldn't they be cooked, just a little? I asked. No, she said emphatically.
These are a Shanghai speciality. If you even show them a wok, all their
flavour will go.
But how do I eat them? The lady obliged. You simply pick one up with your
chopsticks, dip it in the sauce - a mixture of Chinese wine, dark sauce and
chillis - and then bite it, just there, behind the head. Then you suck away,
leaving behind only the shrimp's empty armour.
Even the bicyled-out policeman had turned to watch. Too late to turn back
now. A challenge. A stiff upper lip and firm grasp of chopsticks was called
for.
I lifted the cover. Shrimps cartwheeled out. I caught one and dipped it in
the wine. Presumably, the shrimps are supposed to enter the next world
happily sozzled. Not so this one. Halfway to the mouth he did a triumphant
flip, flicking Chinese wine into my eye while disappearing somewhere behind
my left ear.
Guffaws from the restaurant. An old man wiped the tears from his eyes. A
young girl giggled until her cheeks were ablaze.
I tried again. Success. And here I have to make a terrible admission. The
shrimps were very good. The best I have ever tasted. Sweet yet bold, with a
heady piquancy about them. But eating all of them was a tiring business. The
stomach had put up the red flag long ago, but no matter. To leave one shrimp
would have been a grave gastronomic sin.
Of course, none of this goes down well with the POSS gang. The consumption
of live shrimps is all right, it seems, for the Shanghainese. But if the
habit spreads to the west, then all of shrimp society, as we know it, could
be undermined.
I have sent POSS pleading letters. I was hungry, I said. I was ignorant. The
shrimps were happily drunk. I have promised to confine my live shrimp-eating
to Shanghai. I will not tell a soul about how wonderful it all was.
But will POSS listen? I sense their little black eyes searching for me,
their little legs swimming ever closer. They are an unforgiving lot.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Labour of gastronomic love - A very individual
food guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I SAT opposite my guest at a booth in Bentley's in the west end of London
and for the next two hours we talked restaurants.
There was no overt criticism of any particular establishment as there might
have been if my guest had been a restaurateur, nor were there any of the
guarded comments that can often be exchanged by two restaurant writers keen
to protect information and sources of gossip.
But, in spite of my own enthusiasm and knowledge of restaurants, after our
talk I knew that I had met my match. My guest, Thomas Henkel, a 44-year-old
senior manager with Conoco, who manages its 270-strong fleet of chemical
tankers from the gastronomic wasteland of Wilmington, Delaware, had been to
more restaurants, hotels and bars than most people in the food business.
And he had catalogued them all. Since he took up this hobby in the mid-1980s
he had compiled a computer list, based on visits to more than 500 American
eateries. Then, in late 1987, in a move which he described as one of the
greatest pieces of good fortune in his life, he had been transferred to
London when the American dollar was strong.
He was quick to take advantage of all that Britain could offer and then,
when his job expanded, he travelled widely abroad. After 4 1/2 -years his
word processor contained 1,789 entries including 1,001 on the UK, 62 on
Germany, 39 on Spain and 57 on China and 19 on Tibet, part of a holiday
Henkel organised with the proviso that he organise all the meals personally.
Since his return to the US Henkel has put together another list containing
more than 500 American entries so that his total now stands at just under
3,000. Each entry gives all the usual particulars, the bill's total, a
recommended table or room a short, descriptive note and a rating out of 10.
His rating philosophy is based on an amalgamation of food, service, ambience
and, most importantly, he believes, an appreciation of what the restaurant
is trying to be. This allows him to rate a good local bistro on the same
basis as a fine restaurant. Top marks go to Comme chez Soi, Brussels, Im
Schiffchen, Dusseldorf, and L'Arlequin in London. Bottom of the class is a
pub in London's West End and a bar in Texas. Finally, there are four graphs
highlighting restaurant costs, cuisine types, number of visits per week and
restaurant locations.
Although Henkel is aware of the commercial possibilities of his guide he is
reluctant to pursue them at present. He enjoys his job with Conoco but says
compiling the guide is a hobby which has made him a worldwide network of
friends.
For a copy of Thomas Henkel's Guide send a self-addressed envelope to 16 Fox
Hill Lane, Greenville, Delaware 19807, USA.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: Pools of plenty in a parched land - Namibia's water
holes are a magnet for all forms of wildlife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE LINED the walls three deep, murmuring to one another with the hushed
reverence of a religious ceremony, the anticipation of a theatre audience
and the suppressed excitement of a rock concert. Floodlights bathed the
stage and yet we did not know who would star, what the performance would be,
or even if the show was to go on.
Then, soundlessly, a hook-lipped rhino cow entered the light followed by her
calf. Silence fell at the sight of these rare beasts - followed almost at
once by a restrained gasp, for they were trailed by a lion and a lioness.
Then, to the rescue, came a male rhino, and the lions backed off. But, like
all the best dramas, the hero's motives were far from pure: the rhino was
more interested in having sex with the female than in saving the calf.
Meanwhile, enter stage right a grinning jackal, head held high with a guinea
fowl grasped in its jaws, before exiting stage left. Okaukuejo's water hole
on a Saturday night is certainly the place for action.
This is the largest of Etosha National Park's three rest camps, and its
floodlit water hole is a perfect way for people to enjoy exciting African
mammals without being confined to a vehicle. Namibia's vast distances mean
many hours on the road, and Okaukuejo came as a welcome break.
Etosha is best known for its immense white pan - acres of dried mud with a
far-off glitter, as if from an incoming tide. It floods rarely, though, and
then with water twice as salty as the sea. The wildlife is attracted to the
many perennial springs along the pan's southern shore, and there is constant
activity at these shrinking pools. Elephant families wash and drink with
abandon, nervous kudu approach with infinite caution, and groups of
ostriches drink alternately, their heads smoothly lifting and falling like
the well-oiled parts of a machine, some scooping water while others swallow,
watching for danger.
Once, an observant giraffe, staring from on high, located a skulking leopard
slinking through the bushes on the far side of the water.
France-sized and with about 1m inhabitants, Namibia is still wild enough to
have significant numbers of game outside its parks, and any water in this
parched country draws animals like moths to a candle. We watched rare desert
elephants pad in to drink at Palmwag and stay to browse the well watered
grounds of the rest camp through the night. Many hundred miles south, in the
Fish River Canyon, a distant pair of olive klipspringers on ballet points
danced nimbly down the smooth rocks to drink from one of the remaining pools
on the canyon floor.
Prior booking and a doctor's certificate are required to walk this canyon,
which is second only to the Grand Canyon in size. Walkers complete their
five-day trek at Ai-Ais, a hot spring resort in the midst of the stony
desert where the outdoor pool, as warm as a bath, discourages all but the
laziest of strokes, while the two whirlpool baths are almost too hot for
anything but a tentative toe.
Not all of the Namib is stony, though, and the Sossusvlei area boasts the
highest dunes in the world. Lofty, and with dramatic peaks, their sandy
faces are sheets of colour which, in the changing light, take on the pinks,
creams, oranges and greens of ice cream, a strange sight for a desert.
The long ridges beg to be climbed and, labouring upwards over the shifting
sand, I was suddenly aware of a profound silence. Conversations on a
neighbouring dune over half-a-mile away were easy to hear. The ranges of
sand roll away in all directions, apparently without life, although an
occasional oryx with ribs showing through corrugated flanks somehow ekes out
a living in this barren land.
Awesome though it is, this giant sand pit is also fun, and suddenly we were
running and tumbling down the steepest face, though not with quite the same
whooping abandon as the two Frenchwomen who followed us.
Diamonds were found among the sand grains on the surface of the Namib during
the last century, and the mining town of Kolmanskop was established in the
midst of the desert. For a time it flourished, its communal hall seeing
plays and gymnastic displays put on by the fit young German immigrants
living there. As the diamonds failed and the focus of interest moved towards
the sea, the town fell into disrepair and is even now being drowned by waves
of sand.
Another town which reflects Namibia's German colonial past is Swakopmund
but, far from becoming a ghost town, it has just celebrated its centenary.
Regarded as the country's premier holiday resort, it attracts the residents
of a summer-baked Windhoek to enjoy its coolness and even its cloud. The
chilling Benguela Current brings thick mists rolling in from the Atlantic to
moisten the air; in the past, it also brought numerous ships to founder on
the rocky western shore.
Swakopmund is almost more German than Germany itself. Its colonial
architecture has been lovingly preserved and, after the rigours of the
desert, the pastries in its cafes and the Teutonic dishes to be enjoyed in
its restaurants seem luxury indeed.
Although distances are great and the roads long, dusty and ruler-straight to
the horizon, possibly 30 miles away, one of the joys of driving yourself in
Namibia is the chance to stay on its guest farms. Unimpressive in
appearance, Otjitambo turned out to be a gem. We dined on fresh produce,
home-made bread and game shot on the farm, overlooked by a set of oryx heads
collected specifically for the odd twists and turns to their normally
slightly curved horns.
At dawn, we climbed a nearby kopje of rounded granite boulders adorned with
grey-barked ghost trees to watch the sun rise; in the evening, we soaked the
dust away in a deep bath fed by one of the two hot springs in northern
Namibia. We stayed just one night, but a week would not have been too long.
Michael Woods was a guest of Air Namibia and Namibia Tourism, which share a
London office (tel: 081-543-2122; fax: 081-543-3398). Air Namibia flies
directly from Heathrow to Windhoek, Namibia's capital.
Companies offering fly-drives to Namibia include: Sunvil Holidays (tel:
081-568-4499); Southern Africa Travel (0904-692469); Art of Travel
(071-738-2038).
Driving on Namibia's tarred roads is easy. There is little traffic and
driving is on the left. Great care is advised on dirt roads, however, and a
maximum 50mph is recommended. You should carry water, extra fuel and at
least one sound spare tyre.
Living is cheap with fuel at 30p a litre (cash only), restaurant meals with
wine about Pounds 10 a head, and full-board accommodation Pounds 30 a night
or less. Camping is simple with plenty of good facilities; equipment can be
hired.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: Let down by tyre trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPARE tyre, fitted after a puncture just six miles before, went down
with a despairing hiss, a sharp stone sticking through its tread. We were 60
miles from the nearest settlement, Khorixas, on the bare ochre slopes of a
dried-up river valley in the deserts of Damaraland.
I took off the offending wheel, dumped it with the punctured tyre it had
already replaced and lowered the rear hub of the Combi on to a large stone.
There was no shortage of large stones. Then we sat in the shade to wait.
It was my lucky day. Within 20 minutes, a remarkably short time on these
infrequently used roads, a couple of fellows drove up with two tyres of
their own to be mended. They had left a second, crippled vehicle on the road
behind us. Not only were they going into Khorixas and coming back but their
estate car was fast, comfortable and air-conditioned.
We hurried into the tyre repairers. Fortune was still smiling for there was
a bank opposite and I needed more cash to pay for the work.
Then it was discovered that one of my punctures could be mended but the
other, the spare, had been so shoddily repaired previously that the stone
had ruined the tyre. Fortunately, among the nine assorted new tyres on the
rack was one that fitted the wheel, but at a cost of Pounds 100 - wine might
be cheap here but rubber was certainly expensive.
With all four tyres repaired or replaced and inflated, the three of us
returned in air-conditioned comfort to the desert and to our respective
vehicles. Our new tyre lasted precisely 20 miles before puncturing. Lady
luck was in fickle mood. But we limped to the garage in Khorixas once more,
just in time to mend our third puncture before it closed.
A whole day had gone. But the following morning we were able to swap our
Combi for a 4x4 with tougher tyres. And the hire company looked kindly on
our contention that the puncture in the spare supplied had been poorly
repaired and refunded the money for the new tyre.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: High hopes of intrigue on the Andalus Express -
Nicholas Woodsworth yearns for mystery and passion on a luxury train journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DAY 1: Seville
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cordoba - Granada:
Glass of Jerez fino in hand, I stand at a swaying bar. Beside me is a woman,
dark and dressed in red. Her voice is low, her accent mysterious. Her bangle
earrings swing to the rhythm of the train.
Framed in the window behind her I can see a Mediterranean spring racing by.
But for the moment I am not interested in olive trees, sunflowers and white
cottages. I am interested in foul deeds. The woman's eyes have narrowed.
'Murder,' she whispers to me. 'What we need is a good murder.'
Beatriz, of course, is only kidding. We are not discussing foul deeds at
all, but the reputations of luxury trains. She is one of the red-uniformed
hostesses who sees that things run smoothly on the Andalus Express. I am one
of 36 guests who have boarded for a four-day tour of the cities and
countryside of Andalusia in southern Spain.
We both agree. Nothing ever did any train so much good as Agatha Christie's
story of violent death on the Orient Express. What matters is not that the
Orient Express is no longer oriental - it terminates in Venice - but the
cachet remains. Intrigue, mystery and hidden passions have become an
important, perhaps vital, part of the romantic lure of luxury train travel.
There has not been foul play aboard the Andalus Express so far, but there is
plenty of mystery. It is an odd thing to be thrown into intimate contact
with total strangers in the close quarters of a rushing train. I gaze down
the length of the wood-panelled, art-deco style bar-car at the assembled
guests awaiting dinner.
We may come from different countries, but as a group we are middle-aged and
middle class. We appear, superficially, profoundly ordinary. Is it possible
that there are hidden passions and secrets here? On trains, where the
mystery of fellow travellers is only slowly unfolded and never wholly
revealed, anything is possible.
Only this morning, as we toured Seville, we were merely 36 faceless tourists
in a far larger crowd of faceless tourists. In the Casa Pilatos, our first
encounter with the Moorish traditions of southern Spain, we listened as our
guide, Maria-Teresa, introduced us to the architecture of horseshoe arch and
colonnaded courtyard, domed roof and polychrome tile. Our comments on the
bougainvillaea in the gardens were polite but distant.
Not even the overpowering Santa Maria cathedral, where we walked craning
upwards like Lilliputians on an inspection tour, brought us together. The
only things as stiff as our manners were our necks.
It was during lunch, served as the train rolled along the flat plain between
Seville and Cordoba, that the ice began to break. In a lavish dining car of
brocade upholstery, pale rose curtains and floral inlay wall panels, we
worked our way, with a little gentle cajoling from the waiters, through a
vast menu: asparagus soup, salmon and endive salad, seafood mousse,
batter-fried squid, whitefish with fresh asparagus, veal in red wine sauce,
cheese, fruit and three different deserts, including kiwi cheesecake.
This is not the kind of meal that goes without comment. Halfway through it,
helped by liberal doses of rich red Rioja, American, Swiss and even the
British - the most reserved travellers in the world - were beginning to
delve into the lives of their neighbours.
At my own table, Thaddeus is Norwegian and somewhat short on light humour.
Dark and brooding, he seems to have escaped from an Ibsen play. Tom and
Karen are not from an Ibsen play, but from Chicago. True, they have some
lamentable American habits. They drink Coke Lite throughout their meals. Tom
tells questionable jokes, the Waco massacre being his current source of
inspiration. He keeps two handguns in his house. And he admires Bruce
Willis.
But all is forgiven because Tom went to school with Hillary Clinton and has
the latest family dirt. Hillary, it seems, has begun throwing things at
Bill. First it was a lamp, then a telephone. With this grade of information,
Tom is a man I could have more than a lunch or two with. I cannot figure out
whether he is a gangster or a society gossip. Following our afternoon
walking tour of Cordoba, I am almost certain he is not an architect. For
Tom, the great Cordoba mosque, with its 856 magnificent stone columns topped
with red and white double arches, is 'kinda cute.'
Day 2: Granada - Ronda:
Last night, before retiring to bed with a copy of Dial M for Murder, I
strolled into the lounge for a little after-dinner dancing. As the train
rumbled through the dark towards Granada, couples clung together for support
and swayed over the dance-floor to the rhythm of the train and the music
provided by Pedro the piano player and his electronic Yamaha.
Actually, I find Pedro as mysterious as anyone on this train. He is an
accomplished musician. But sometimes, in the middle of some emotional piece,
he gets up and walks away from his Yamaha, leaving it playing by itself.
Anyone who can be so open about deception has to have something to hide.
On the other hand, even Agatha Christie herself would be suspicious of just
about every one of the Andalus Express' 23 staff. What, to cite only one
example, about the lovely Pilar? She is gorgeous, a delicate Andalusian
beauty with flashing eyes. She claims to be the train's technical engineer,
on hand to repair electrical systems, plumbing or air-conditioning. A likely
story. I do not believe a word of it.
Or what about the American mystery couple who came aboard with their own
stock of American drinking water? They emerge from their sleeping-car suite
only occasionally for meals and tours, and are the subject of intense
lunchtime speculation. Honeymooners? An easy enough cover. Certainly they
made a good show of it strolling hand-in-hand through the palaces and
gardens of the Alhambra this morning. And then suddenly, this afternoon, at
the tiny rose-bush-smothered station of Salinas high up in the Andalusian
hills, they disembarked without a word, taking their cases of water with
them.
Rum goings-on indeed. Poirot would not have stood for it. I am going to bed
with The French Quarter Killers.
Day 3: Ronda-Puerto Santa Maria:
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the train. The local guides who show us
around the towns we stop in keep telling us that Andalusia is an extremely
dry place, but even the weather is acting suspiciously: it is pretending it
is English. Today, in the mountain town of Ronda, it is bucketing down. We
abandoned our pose as luxury travellers and walked through the rain with
plastic bags on our heads.
I have added eight more passengers to my list of potential perpetrators of
possible crimes. They are four English couples from Coventry who travel
everywhere together. Odd in itself. Apparently, the men were executive
co-owners of a Midlands engineering firm until, suddenly, a couple of years
ago, they upped and sold the company and began a high life of 'retirement.'
The dining car is abuzz. There are jokes about spare parts and big guns for
Iraq.
I am off to bed for a couple of chapters of In Cold Blood.
Day 4: Jerez-Seville:
The vast meals in the Andalus Express' dining car are beginning to tell.
This morning, dressed in our bathrobes and heading in opposite directions to
and from the shower car, a rather large woman and I almost failed to
negotiate the narrow corridor of carriage No 4. Any more of this kind of
eating and passengers will not be able to slide past each other at all.
The programme continues at a hectic pace. Today we will be visiting and
wine-tasting at the Domecq winery, one of the oldest and largest sherry
houses in Jerez. We shall also be attending a performance at the Royal
Spanish Riding School. Once again there will be an endless lunch before we
return to our starting point at Santa Justa station in Seville. The tour is
almost over.
But I, for one, have not given up hope. The mystery and intrigue remain
until the last minute. How might it happen? A glass of poisoned Double
Century? A rigged accident of rearing horses and flaying hoofs? Death by
over-eating? And to whom? Pedro the piano player? Tom from Chicago? One of
the Coventry crew? The lovely Pilar? The possibilities are endless. The
ultimate in train fantasies might still come true. There is time yet for
murder on the Andalus Express.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Seville on Iberia Airlines (London tel:
071-437-5622). His trip on the Andalus Express was arranged by Cox &amp; Kings
Travel, St James Court, 45 Buckingham Gate, London SW1 (071-834-7472). Cox &amp;
Kings offers an all-inclusive Andalus Express package - including airfare,
London-Seville - for Pounds 1,450. It offers various other luxury Spanish
train circuits.
Next week: more journeys by train.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Fashion: Flower power for a very Nineties summer - The
floral frock is back. But, says Avril Groom, the modern version is a long
way from Laura Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 40 years since Laura Ashley started making tea towels and aprons on
her kitchen table in London's Pimlico and 25 since she launched the first of
her printed dresses that were to alter the fashion perceptions of a
generation of British women.
This year, appropriately, the floral frock is back - but what would the late
Laura make of it now? She was designing in a tradition going back to the
18th century, fabrics from which inspired some of her flower-sprig prints.
The tradition periodically surfaced in fashion until the 1920s. Historically
it belonged as much to the milkmaid in simple printed cotton as to the lady
in summer garden silks but, if fashion can be said to mimic television
series, the Ashley look was aimed Upstairs rather than Down. It was
essentially British, rural and, in the early 1970s, aspirational.
The floral frock's latest reincarnation is none of these. Now that design
thinking deems it unworthy to look like a possessor of wealth, inspiration
comes from the opposite end of the social scale. In this case that means
either wartime flea-market Parisiennes with drooping cigarettes and clumpy
wedge sandals, or East European gipsy refugees and their sanitised fashion
equivalents, the neo-hippies in mismatched print layers.
The roots of this odd skewing of a classic look are decidedly French. The
young Parisian deconstructionists have embraced it enthusiastically, with
designers such as Martin Margiela seeking out 1940s dresses to recut and mix
with devastating effect. But the origins of it lie with the often-prophetic
Jean-Paul Gaultier, a disciple of bondage corsetry and mannish tailoring who
first showed he had a softer side with a memorable mid-1980s collection of
faded flower-print chiffon overalls, aprons and lingerie lace, layered over
his usual pinstripes. He called it 'La concierge est dans l'escalier' and
has said since that he has 'the tastes of a concierge'.
Now this is what everyone claims and, though Gaultier's look took some time
to take off, by last summer every city girl in France and Italy looked like
a concierge in a floppy, navy or black sprig-printed button-through frock
worn with tennis shoes and tanned legs (still perfectly good styling for hot
weather this year).
On the catwalk, printed overalls and turban-tied headscarves came even from
that icon of 1980s success-dressing, Chanel. Add an injection of American
grunge nostalgia and the resulting style makes you look, even if you inhabit
a large country house, as if you should wield the duster rather than the
purse strings.
It sounds unpromising, yet this is a style with charm and practicality. The
secret of making it look good is, as with so much of this summer's fashion,
in the layering. Too often the traditional British floral frock does not
tally with the traditional British summer climate and disappears under
ill-assorted cardigans or coats. This year that is exactly what it is
supposed to do, but naturally the results are best if it is thought through
and co-ordinated first.
Colour-matched mixed prints, stripes and spots can look richly wonderful, if
slightly Bohemian. A classic floral frock from last time round passes muster
if you give some fresh thought to layering. Put a stripey T-shirt or a
skinny jumper under it, making it more useful on cooler days, plus another
cropped or skinny knit on top. In warm weather, sandwich it with this
summer's light, transparent layers such as a lacy camisole, a loose chiffon
shirt or a crochet waistcoat.
Strappy dresses that will become sunfrocks in high summer can be layered
pinafore-style for now. And why stick to one dress when you can wear two? A
button-through frock can double up as a fluid coat, this season's favoured
way of expressing softness and newer-looking than a jacket. By wearing the
dresses together or separately you also multiply your choices.
This need not be an expensive option. The floral frock is everywhere, from
chainstore versions not much over Pounds 20 through the middle of the market
to designer originals such as Ralph Lauren's fragile silk slip at Pounds
700-plus. The designer end gives you silk, chiffon, subtle prints and more
swirly fabric for your money; the middle good shapes but a tendency to
polyester; the chainstores offer still nice floppy viscose, though with a
skimpier one-sized cut, shaped with ties at the back and, harking back to
the 1940s originals, a resurgence of shoulderpads.
The comforting thought is that, after the passion for layers has faded, all
these dresses will slide easily back under a plain tailored jacket to become
the classic British summer look once more.
To show how concierge style suits gracious summer living, we photographed it
at Llangoed Hall, the Wye Valley hotel owned by Sir Bernard Ashley and
decorated by his son Nick, former design chief of Laura Ashley. Here we show
how, mixed with other good, simple pieces, the chintzy print can look softly
elegant - just like the floral frock.

FT  12 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: A capital feast of fine reading - Book
Fairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM ST CLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE WITH an interest in old books contrives to be in London in June. Each
year an immense number of rare, antiquarian, or just second-hand, books are
offered for sale at a series of fairs held in London hotels. A few fairs
offering prints, maps, and ephemera are arranged to coincide.
Although the fairs do about half their business within the trade, the public
are welcome at all of them. This year the rival associations have cooperated
to produce a useful leaflet setting out the times and locations, with an
accompanying map of central London and advice on how to get there by bus or
tube. Copies are available free at the fairs, and in advance at many
bookshops.
However, the information gives little guidance on what to expect. Like
corporations, the fairs nowadays prefer to be known by their initials, the
full names no longer being an adequate description. By far the biggest are
the two PBFA fairs at the Russell hotel near the British Museum, at which
240 dealers offer 85,000 books. The two fairs run consecutively, with a
complete change of stock. The catalogue, to be bought at the door or in
advance, admits to both. PBFA concentrates on the middle price range, Pounds
20 to Pounds 100. Collectors are seldom disappointed, but they need patience
in their title-hunting.
The Bloomsbury at the Royal National hotel is also large and varied, more
second-hand than antiquarian. The Bonnington is the cheapest. These are
fairs for readers and researchers - who are not always the same as
collectors - but the vigilant can sometimes intercept bargains on their way
up the market. More expensive books are to be found at the International
Book Fair at the Cafe Royal near Piccadilly Circus.
The culmination of the week is the ABA Antiquarian Book Fair at the Park
Lane hotel in Piccadilly opposite Green Park. Now in its 34th year, this is
a truly international event with exhibitors from the US, Europe, the Middle
East, and elsewhere. Books to the value of Pounds 15m are on offer this
year.
The tiny 33-page collection of poems of Wilfred Owen, which Sassoon
published in 1920 and which was the start of Owen's fame, costs Pounds 335;
the longer edition prepared by Blunden in 1931 costs Pounds 350 (from
Marrin). As usual there is a fine selection of colour plate topographical
books priced in the low thousands. A splendid letter from Mary Queen of
Scots instructing the Earl of Bothwell to hunt down rebels is offered at
Pounds 26,500 (Wilson) - a few months later Bothwell murdered the Queen's
husband and took his place. Susan Biltcliffe offers a collection of
catalogues of artists' materials of the 1890s, works of art in their own
right, at Pounds 2,000. Especially appealing are two albums of songs and
other music, discovered 15 years ago, transcribed in manuscript by Jane
Austen and other members of her family for Pounds 21,000 from Finch.

FT  12 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: Hello palefaces, found a summer wigwam? -
Lucia van der Post has been looking at ways of sheltering herself and her
cucumber sandwiches from the ravages of the weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT pale skins are the only fashionable sort to have, what every
self-respecting garden, even British ones, needs is a refuge from the
weather - if not the wind and the rain, then from the sun.
No doubt inspired by the depleting ozone layer and insatiable demands for
all things horticultural, a whole host of companies is offering all manner
of structures in which to shelter from the elements this year.
Some can be used as tranquil retreats in which to read and survey the
landscape. Others are welcoming shelters from sudden showers and chill
breezes. Others still can be shady bowers bedecked and embellished with
climbing flowers.
They come in all shapes and sizes and with a variety of names. Of all garden
structures gazebos have the least practical purpose. They are there simply
to be beautiful.
They take their name (so The Secret Garden Company informs me) from a
'waggish pretence of Latin learning', purporting as they do to be places
from which to gaze. A gazebo, it seems, should be open and octagonal,
hexagonal or square.
It requires a fine position and often can be heavily overgrown or
intertwined with climbing flowers, with clematis and roses, with honeysuckle
and ivy.
Pavilions, on the other hand, are designed to give shelter from sun, wind or
rain and are normally to be found beside swimming pools or tennis courts.
From there you can take tea and sponge cake while watching a drama unfold on
the croquet lawn or applauding a few sets of lawn tennis.
Summer houses are where you sit peacefully and quietly, reading, taking in
the view, enjoying those leisured afternoons where the sun always shines,
there are cucumber sandwiches for tea, croquet on the lawn and punting on
the river.
If you have a garden which could do with a bit more structural interest, or
maybe needs a little embellishing or even furnishing, then here are a just a
few of the latest ideas around . . .
Barnsley House, as many readers will know, does several ranges of clean and
classic garden furniture. It has now started to sell a new line of Italian
sun umbrellas, complete with wooden poles and frames and cream cotton tops,
pictured above.
Each umbrella also has double pulleys with nylon wheels and wind cowls. Not
cheap, at Pounds 265 each, they are beautifully made and, to my mind at any
rate, look so much more at home in an English garden than their more
gaudily-coloured relations.
They come in two shapes and sizes - round (3 metres in diameter) and
rectangular (2 m by 3 m) and both cost the same. There is a lighter-weight
version, with a single-wheel pulley and with no wind vents, that looks
nearly as elegant and is considerably cheaper at Pounds 145 for the 2.5 m
size.
All can be bought by mail order from Barnsley House, near Cirencester,
Gloucestershire GL7 5EE (Tel: 0285-740-561) and there is a splendid
full-colour brochure of all their wares on offer. The Barnsley House
showroom is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 5.30 pm.
Past Times is a mail order company which, it will not surprise you, is
heavily into nostalgia. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Some of its
wares are charming and when it comes to gardens it has much to offer.
It has, this summer, produced a mini-catalogue devoted to the outdoor,
horticultural life. The highly ornate gazebo pictured above is light, airy
and romantic and made (so the catalogue tells me) in the 17th century
tradition, all intricate and curly hand-made steel. Weatherproofed with a
fashionable verdigris finish it is 8 ft high and 6 ft in diameter and sells
for Pounds 995. You will have to assemble it yourself - unless you have a
really handy handy-man.
Much less expensive, at Pounds 249.50, is the portable Edwardian pavilion.
Some 6 ft by 3 ft by 6 ft high, it has a weatherproofed acrylic cover
supported by a folding hardwood frame. Look out, too, for wooden garden
chests (for keeping wellingtons and garden tools), for fine wooden croquet
sets, steamer chairs and Versailles tubs.
The catalogue offers just one garden bench but it is a beauty - the Hatfield
bench, reproduced from a classic design of about 1895 by JP White, who
worked with Gertrude Jekyll and Lutyens. Measuring 6 ft by 1 ft 6 in by 3 ft
2 ins, it is made of solid unvarnished weatherproof teak, has a charming,
delicate curving design incorporated into the back and costs Pounds 395.
Past Times has some 21 shops throughout the UK but these particular items
are available by mail order only, tel: 0993-779444. Orders may take up to 28
days for delivery, so hurry, hurry if you want to catch the summer.
When Robin and Mary Ellis wanted a summer house beside their swimming pool
they remembered the lovely Kentish oast house they lived in years ago and
used its distinctive, pleasing lines as the basis of their own design. It
was such a success, and so many friends wanted one, that they set up in
business providing miniature oast houses. A team of first class builders
will put one up in two weeks once planning permission, site surveys and
other boring necessities have been gone through. They are built on proper
foundations and are more of a real house than a summer house. Shiplap
cedarwood is used for the octagonal walls and clay tiles for the conical
roof. Douglas fir hand-turned pillars are on the veranda. The doors are
either of mahogany or Douglas fir and come with brass or wrought-iron
furniture.
The result, pictured below, could be used for a host of purposes - study,
playroom, artist's studio, gym, home office. They come in two sizes - 12 ft
or 17 ft in diameter, for Pounds 15,000 or Pounds 18,000 (plus VAT). Write
to Robin and Mary Ellis, Rumwood, Horseheath, Cambridge CB1 6QX (tel:
0223-892596) for details.
The Secret Garden company of Ware offers at least six different structures
to embellish a garden. There are gazebos and summer houses, pavilions or
octagonal houses, all made from sturdy timbers such as Western Red Cedar and
Ghanaian iroko, with leaded light windows and solid brass furniture for
windows and doors.
Six roof shapes and 17 panels are the basis of all the designs - whether a
lightly romantic gazebo or a solidly protective summerhouse. Some, such as
the gazebos, would look best carefully sited for views and vistas; others,
such as the pavilions, could be placed beside a swimming pool or tennis
court.
The company delivers and installs the buildings but asks customers to
provide the concrete base. Prices range from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 8,000 -
a hexagonal gazebo with open sides and Iroko railings would cost Pounds
2,971 (including delivery, installation and VAT) whilst the rectangular
pavilion pictured above costs Pounds 5,436.
For a leaflet illustrating the main designs write to The Secret Garden
Company of Ware, Maplewood, Ware, Hertfordshire, SG12 OXN. Tel: 0920-462081.
FOR THOSE who like their garden appurtenances old, battered and
well-weathered Capital Garden Products has developed a new material, a
bronze powder mixed with resins, which gives all the standard garden items -
the urns, the jardinieres, the window-boxes and the planters - an air of
great antiquity.
'For years,' says Jerry Carr, its managing director, 'we have seen some
modest attempts at producing false verdigris bronze finishes and now after
months of experimenting we have come up with this splendid material, which
combines resins with a considerable amount of bronze. No one should be
embarrassed at thinking our casts are made of solid bronze and finding that
they are not.'
The range includes things as small as a 10 in diameter Devil's Punchbowl
(copied from a Jacobean antique) which sells for Pounds 36 and as splendid
as the Rams Head Urn (24 in diameter by 24 in high) photographed below,
which sells for Pounds 247.50.
Write to Capital Garden Products, Hurst Green, Etchingham, E. Sussex TN19
7QU (Tel: 0580-201092) sending four first class stamps for a brochure or to
buy by mail. Otherwise they can be bought from The Chelsea Gardener, 125
Sydney Street, London SW3 or from Clifton Nurseries, Clifton Villas, off
Warwick Avenue, London W9.
Chairs are essential to the outdoor or conservatory life. Classic
deck-chairs, steamer chairs and safari versions all have one important
quality - they stack, which means they can be easily stowed when summer is
over or when the space is required for some other purpose.
The Indian Ocean Trading Company has brought out a range of exceptionally
sturdy folding garden furniture. All made from teak, the safari chair
(Pounds 110) is photographed here left, but it also sells the other classics
of the genre, the steamer chair (with cushions, Pounds 420) and the
deck-chair (Pounds 80). The fabric is a heavy-duty marine dralon,
scotch-guarded and flame-proof, and comes in dark green, burgundy or cream.
Indian Ocean Trading Company has a showroom at 28 Ravenswood Road, London
SW12 9PJ but it will take orders by telephone (081-675-4808).
Barnsley House also has some wonderfully solid teak garden furniture -
everything from armchairs to benches and this exceptionally elegant outdoor
dining chair. Called the Tetbury, it is beautiful from almost every angle.
The full length back makes it elegant from the back as well as from the
front.
As with all Charles Verey's designs much thought has gone into the
measurements to make sure they are the right height for the tables they
sell. As he puts it in the introduction to his catalogue: 'If you have
fought with dining chairs just too wide to fit as pairs around a table, or
benches that won't fit under tables, then you will appreciate the care we
take to produce combinations which suit small and large spaces.'
The Tetbury costs Pounds 205. The brochure has many other options. Write to
Barnsley House, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire GL7 5EE.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Taylor makes a rod for his back - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Football Association's appoints a successor to Graham Taylor as
manager of the England team the first question they should ask is: 'Do you
go fishing?'
While Taylor occupies the weeks between internationals fretting about his
opponents' strengths, Jack Charlton, the manager of the Republic of Ireland,
goes fishing. While Taylor's team are performing in US soccer's rehearsal
for the World Cup like understudies for a pantomime horse, the Irish are
galloping like thoroughbreds towards a starring role in the show.
As Don Revie, Jack Charlton's old mentor, showed when he managed England in
the 1970s, the obsessiveness which can be an asset for a club manager can be
disastrous for a national one who has little time with his players. Revie
overmanaged. Taylor has similar faults.
Taylor complains that the English league's fixture load damages his players.
But Charlton and Terry Yorath of Wales, who must pick from a far smaller
pool of players in the same league, have overcome this problem, while
Taylor's selection policies have exacerbated it. Last summer, Taylor
deprived Ian Wright of experience by leaving him out of the European
championship.
Taylor set out this summer with three goalscorers: Wright, who had just
eight caps, Les Ferdinand (two) and Teddy Sheringham (none). In three games
each has played a half alone and a half with each of the others. The only
untried permutation is all three at once. Even if Taylor does not know what
his best attack is, common sense suggests he should stick with one
combination.
Taylor often allows his opponent's to pick his teams. Against Norway, to
combat an attack no better than most in the Premier League, he made four
changes from the side that had drawn against Poland three days earlier and
altered formation. He brought back Gary Pallister after more than a year to
partner Tony Adams for the first time, moved Des Walker to a position he
dislikes and paired Sheringham and Ferdinand for the first time. He also
asked winger Lee Sharpe, in his first full England game, to play in a
defensive role. Time and again Taylor picks players out of position in the
hope that they will do a bit of both jobs. It never works.
The job of an international manager is to find a formation in which the
players he picks are comfortable. Against Norway Taylor created a situation
in which they were uncomfortable and uncertain.
During Taylor's three years in charge the high morale built up in England's
run to the World Cup semi-final in Italy in 1992 has gradually collapsed.
There have been good performances, but recently only at Wembley inspired by
Paul Gascoigne. Taylor discarded Peter Beardsley and Chris Waddle and drove
away Gary Lineker. In their place he has a collection of players he has
called 'headless chickens'. This recent habit of deflecting criticism by
blaming the players only damages morale further.
On Wednesday against the US in Foxboro the England team gave Taylor a vote
of no confidence. This was not the poorest performance of his three years as
manager but it was the most depressing.
Taylor reverted to a familiar English formation. Each player was in a
familiar position. The match started well. But when the US took the lead,
England unravelled. Most kept trying. But the players self-belief ebbed.
Four times Wright, a particular victim of Taylor's vacillation in selection,
found chances which he would have converted for his club. Three times he
missed, once he even tried to pass - avoiding a responsibility he rarely
shirks.
By the end England were no longer a team. They had voted with their feet. A
quick way to restore morale is to replace the manager. Taylor should buy a
rod, he may soon have a lot of time to go fishing.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Somerset's rustic joys - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN IN Somerset, it is a delight to see how much they like cricket. While
there are only three first-class grounds - at Taunton, Bath and
Weston-super-Mare - they attract good crowds. Pubs and hotels decorate their
walls with framed photographs of cricketing heroes. 'You're never far from
cricket down here,' said the proprietress of our hotel.
The church just down the road from the county ground in Taunton goes further
than that, proclaiming itself on its notice board as 'St James next to the
cricket.' You even smell the game in Somerset because you are never far from
cider - and cider sponsors cricket.
The Taunton ground is small, basic and welcoming, selling better cider than
beer. It has a little museum with a wide range of exhibits, including one of
Joel Garner's size-15 cricket shoes. Such fondness for the game is all the
more remarkable since Somerset have never won the county championship. Their
nature is to play at full tilt, erratically.
One-day cricket kept things cheerful, starting with victory in the Gillette
cup and John Player league in 1979, the Benson and Hedges cup in 1981 and
'82, and the NatWest trophy in 1983. In those five years Somerset became the
rustic champions of big-hitting cricket, basking in the feats of their great
west country heroes: Ian Botham, Viv Richards and Joel Garner, natives of
Cheshire, Antigua and Barbados respectively.
Somerset always have had a strong sense of local identity, without letting
Somerset ancestry or provenance cramp their style. The other day, I watched
their cosmopolitan team play a team from Glamorgan which had five Welsh
players and several with Welsh accents.
By contrast, only one of the Somerset players, batsman Richard Harden, came
from Somerset. The rest were imports, not just from elsewhere in England
but, in the positively universal mode of numbers eight, nine and 10 in the
Somerset line-up, from Pakistan (Mushtaq Ahmed), New Zealand (Andrew
Caddick) and the Netherlands (Adrianus van Troost).
So far, Mushtaq looks like a successful signing. Those who saw him removing
England's spin-blind batsman last summer will remember how effective his
leg-spin, peppered with googlies and wrong 'uns, can be on English pitches.
He is the right kind of high-voltage cricketer to revive Somerset.
In turn, they are taking care to keep him happy because they are liable to
intermittent spots of bother with their overseas players. Last year, the
South African all-rounder Richard Snell, was released after a feeble season;
Australian Ken Macleay went home to take up farming; and Dutchman Roland
Lefebvre was allowed to end his contract a year early.
I watched Lefebvre playing for his new county, Glamorgan, along with another
ex-Somerset man, Richards. Somerset got rid of Richards and Garner after the
1986 season whereupon Richards' furious friend, Botham, also left. It was a
bitter set of dismissals and departures and Peter Roebuck, appointed captain
in 1986, fought to keep his team together.
In 1987, he was helped by the new overseas signing, New Zealander Martin
Crowe, who was just what the county wanted: a devoted club man as well as a
star batsman. When New Zealand's quickly-arranged tour of Sri Lanka at the
end of the 1987 season was cancelled just as quickly, Crowe flew straight
back, like a true son of Taunton, to play for his county.
Nevertheless, Somerset have lacked both inspiration and brute force since
their one-day flourish a decade ago. Last year, they finished ninth in the
county table, the first time since 1984 they have managed to get as high as
half-way.
They got there in true Somerset style, with dramatic victories at the
beginning and end of the season, a dead patch in the middle, and a rattling
game against Pakistan - which they lost all ends up. Caddick's six for 73 on
Somerset's behalf shared the headlines with Mushtaq's five for 46 for
Pakistan, Mushtaq impressing his victims' talent scouts in the process.
Somerset recovered some of their sparkle last year under the dynamic
guidance of their new director of cricket, Bob Cottam. It is to the credit
of both that Cottam and captain Chris Tavare that two such different
characters can work together, particularly as Tavare has been struggling to
recover his form.
His grafting 148 not out off Glamorgan's uninspired bowling was slow going,
but invaluable to Somerset's eventual win. The lady next to me in the crowd
gave a combined nod and shake of her head when Tavare reached his century
with an elegant cut for four. 'I like him to play his shots,' she sighed.
Tavare likes it, too. He is a natural stroke player, as he showed for Oxford
university and Kent in the 1970s. He explained, with a wistful smile: 'I
just fell into the dour mode because it was the best way to stay in the Test
team. I know it's boring. Even I get bored sometimes.'
Tavare is a quiet, modest man, nicknamed 'Rowdy' by his team-mates and
inclined nowadays to play quiet, modest cricket, except sometimes in one-day
games when he plays fiercely. He says he likes Somerset, to which he moved
in 1989, cheered all the way by his Somerset-born wife.
In 1990, he took over the captaincy from his old Oxford friend, Vic Marks,
and found his first year in office pretty tough. 'I had to re-appraise the
captaincy. But things are better at Somerset now and we have some young
talent coming through.'
That young talent includes Harvey Trump, an enthusiastic off-spinner born in
Taunton, and Mark Lathwell, a fearsome opening batsman. When Lathwell opens
with Nick Folland they make an opening pair with panache. Both, like
Mushtaq, were recruited bravely by Cottam.
Somerset are one of the few, precious counties (Derbyshire are another) for
whom enthusiasm and style matter more than results. Good luck to them.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Lions face extinction - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE time you have read this you will be one up on me, you will know the
score because the first Test against the All Blacks will be over.
I wish I could be more confident about the British and Irish Lions but
leaving aside my own prejudice that the whole idea of the Lions concept is
an anachronism, the selection of first Gavin Hastings as captain, and then
the old lags from England did not give me much confidence.
The English have this odd notion that a captain is the first name on the
cards, and then he invites his team to join him in representing his country.
But in the current regime of manager, team coach and specialist coaches, a
captain is more and more obsolete.
Hastings' experience of captaincy has demonstrated that under pressure he
has a tendency to go into his shell and see the game only in terms of his
own performance.
Will Carling is the most experienced captain. His record makes him the most
successful England captain this century but while he is a brilliant player,
he could not captain his way out of a tactical paper bag. He does not seem
mentally or physically fit. He played only 14 club games this season and on
the Lions tour he has struggled to complete a game. Furthermore, his abject
performance as both captain and player against France, Wales and Ireland
suggest that his star is on the wane.
Had the Lions selectors chosen the side first and then the captain, it would
have been a close thing between the maverick Stuart Barnes and the
irrepressible Dean Richards.
I sense that Carling does not want to be in New Zealand. He is a loner. He
is also Geoff Cooke's boy. Cooke was allegedly the only one to vote for
Carling as tour captain. Cooke's future as manager of the England team,
though written in stone until the World Cup in South Africa, still depends
largely on how his protege performs in the next Five Nations Championships.
England have, in Jeremy Guscott, the finest centre in the world. He can kick
equally well off both feet (and, even nonchalantly drops goals with
whichever foot he fancies at the time); who has pace with overdrive and who
is secure in defence but who yet may never realise his true ability. The
fault lies with Carling and, until Barnes replaced him this season, Rob
Andrew. They are instinctively defensive players and prefer to play a tight
restricting game.
This Lions tour may be the last of its kind, truncated as it is to 13 games
as compared to the Lions in New Zealand of 1950 (23 games), 1966 (25), 1971
(24), 1977 (25) and 198, (18).
The threat comes from the world cups of 1995, 1999 and 2003 and, the
possibility that a grand prix circuit might be arranged, if not by the rugby
unions of the senior international countries, then by the senior players.
Money has been a constant talking point among the players. The New Zealand
RFU has announced the All Black Club plan which will, whatever way you look
at, provide the players with a salary of more than Pounds 30,000 a year to
stop them playing for profit overseas. In New Zealand, that bedrock of rugby
union, all is not well.
John Kirwan chose to play in Italy, returning to New Zealand too late to be
considered for the first test. Kirwan, unlike David Campese of Australia,
who at least has Italian parentage, was not there just to visit friends. He
had a contract to play rugby.
Rugby union in New Zealand is under threat from rugby league and soccer.
Hence the announcement this week of the players' funds. Shamateurism is
breaking out all over. Of course, the International Rugby Football Board
could complain but it is toothless and happy to turn a blind eye so that its
power base is not further undermined.
Money was one of the problems on the first Lions tour in 1888 run by Andrew
Stoddart and Bob Seddon. Stoddart played cricket for England in Australia
and along with Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury thought a rugby tour there
would be welcomed.
After Seddon's death sculling on the Hunter River in New South Wales,
Stoddart went on to captain the Lions, and later, England and the formative
Barbarians. He was the first and last player to captain his country in
cricket and rugby.
He approached the Rugby Football Union for permission for such a tour. The
RFU gave its blessings provided the amateur regulations were enforced.
One of the 22 players chosen, A J Stuart of Dewsbury was banned from joining
the leaving party because he had made a deal with an outfitters to kit
himself out. Another player was apparently sent home when he was caught
discussing his chances of becoming a professional as an Australian Rules
player.
This seemed harsh. To raise tour funds and to the chagrin of the RFU, the
Lions played 19 exhibition matches of Australian Rules in Victoria, winning
nine.
It cannot have been coincidental that the next Lions tour, to South Africa
in 1891, was completely underwritten by Cecil Rhodes, prime minister of the
Cape.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Motoring: Small but perfectly formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORING correspondents do not, as rumour would sometimes have it, spend all
their working lives driving supercars at high speed from one luxury watering
hole to another. At least, I do not.
The reason is simple. For every potential buyer of a Ferrari or V12 Jaguar,
there are thousands of motorists to whom small - in size and price - has to
be beautiful. So, as a wine writer might put it, one has to go to Tesco's
tastings as well as those in the first-growth Bordeaux chateaux. And it is
not a bad experience. Recently, I spent two mainly wet and windswept weeks
in a Daihatsu Mira. Next, I drove its bigger brother, the new Daihatsu
Charade, followed by the Mazda 121. My mini-tour ended with the latest
European baby car, the Fiat Cinquecento.
The Mira, a tiny five-door hatchback, only an inch or two longer than a
Mini, is a microcar. These are the only kind Japanese in congested cities
can buy without first proving they have somewhere to park.
The Mira is tall and thin. Though I am well over 6ft, my head did not touch
its roof. I could reach the back seat without contortion and sit there
uncramped. Hip room was limited and with four people on board, luggage space
minimal. But two-up, with the back seat folded, the Mira passed my 'two sets
of golf clubs in their trollies' test easily.
The 847cc engine was so smooth I forgot it had only three cylinders. Using
the slick five-speed gearbox freely, the Mira was quick off the mark in town
and nimble across country. A gentle driver should average at least 50 mpg
(5.65 l/100 km), with 65 mpg (4.34 l/100 km) possible on a long, unhurried
journey.
Because all Charades - they are the Pounds 6,395 Mira's bigger brothers -
have power steering as standard they are even lighter to park. There are six
models: a starter GSe at Pounds 7,995, four more 1.3 litre versions with
manual or automatic transmission at between Pounds 8,795 and Pounds 10,200,
and a warmed-up, 1.6-litre GSXi at Pounds 10,850.
For town use the best Charades are the GXi and GLXi automatics (Pounds 9,645
and Pounds 10,200 respectively) because there is nothing like a small,
lively two-pedal car for taking the stress out of urban motoring. The
transmission is a three-speed plus overdrive which makes motorway driving as
relaxed, but not quite so economical, as in the five-speed manual.
These felt livelier on Scottish moorland roads, the sporty GSXi even more
so, but I would go for the two-pedal versions every time. The multi-valve
engines are so refined the main noise source is tyre roar, and this is a
problem only on really coarse surfaces.
When Mazda introduced the new-shape 121 it was an automatic without the
option and could not be had with power steering. Now it comes with power
steering but two-pedal control is not available. Instead, buyers get a huge,
power-operated fabric sunroof which makes it feel almost as open as a
cabriolet with the side windows up.
The dumpy yet attractively curvy 121 could never be mistaken for anything
else. It is easy to enter and leave through four doors and has a good boot.
Mazda is pitching the Pounds 9,800 121 at young drivers. They probably will
not mind that it has not a single flat surface inside, so that one's
shopping list or letters for the post end up on the floor.
Finally, Fiat's Cinquecento. This carries the banner first raised by the
Fiat 500 in 1936 when it was the first really small car to offer the
sophistication of much larger ones.
The new Cinquecento looks not unlike a scaled down Fiat Uno. Though very
small - only 10ft 7in/317cm long - it has lots of headroom and really does
seat four full-sized people in fair comfort.
It rides better than one has any right to expect of such a small car. There
are no power steering or automatic transmission options and the standard
five-speed gearbox has a rubbery sort of change. But the good news is that
it feels as if the robots in Fiat's Polish factory have screwed it together
properly and the price starts from Pounds 4,995.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Farmers who went to sea - A
couple who found their dream cottage and then worried about work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CYNTHIA HURST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS have to be adaptable, but few would change their plans to suit
circumstances as much as Joe and June Folder have.
The Folders' background is in conventional farm management in northern
England and Wales, but they have turned to raising a completely different
kind of livestock - millions of Pacific oysters - at their farm on the
Cleddau Estuary in Pembrokeshire.
The switch to shellfish followed their discovery 13 years ago of a cottage
set in 23 idyllic acres of Pembrokeshire Coast National Park land
overlooking the estuary.
'This just seemed like a nice place to live,' Joe says, 'so we began looking
for a suitable crop. There were native oysters already growing in the
estuary, which seemed to be a good indication of the potential.'
The Folders set up Carew Oysters in 1980, budgeting about Pounds 52,000 for
equipment and working capital. It took a good deal of persuasion to get the
bank to co - operate, especially as a nearby oyster farm was going bust.
'You can imagine the reaction of a bank manager if you say you want Pounds
50,000 to throw in the river and in three to four years you might begin to
show a return,' Joe says.
The farm's oysters are bought as 2mm seed, or spat, from a hatchery in Kent
and kept in a semi-controlled nursery for a few months until they are about
one inch long and tough enough to survive in the open.
The oysters are then loaded into plastic mesh bags which are placed on
pontoons and transfered to the open estuary, where they will stay for two to
three years. The oysters are spread out over five acres of sea bed where
they feed on plankton and other nutrients brought to them twice a day on the
tide.
During the summer, the 10,000 bags have to be turned once a month to keep
off algae and other fouling organisms. When they eventually reach market
size, the oysters are cleaned inside and out in purification tanks before
being packed, still in their shells, for sale.
Carew Oysters' growth also has been steady, and the business now has five
employees and an annual turnover of Pounds 100,000, representing about a
million oysters.
Half of the crop from the farm, not yet mature, is shipped to countries such
as France and Germany, where they can finish growing to market size and be
sold - quite legally - as 'French' or 'German' oysters.
Joe Folder deals with wholesalers on the continent, but in the UK, a market
he would like to expand, he is aiming more at retail outlets. But the high
street fishmonger who would stock fresh oysters is a disappearing breed,
along with the housewife who would buy from him.
'We have two generations of housewives who don't know anything about fish,'
Joe complains. 'It's all supermarkets now, with everything pre-packaged.'
Nevertheless, he does sell to wholesalers in Wales and England who in turn
sell the oysters to retailers, and Carew Oysters are served in local
restaurants and hotels.
He also runs a mail order business, marketing the oysters, with their
reputation as both an upmarket food and an aphrodisiac, as the perfect gift
for St Valentine's, anniversaries or other special occasions. Food shows and
exhibitions provide another way of bringing oysters and the public together,
and there is a shop at the farm with free samples for visitors.
'It's sometimes difficult to get people to try oysters,' Joe says, 'but once
they do, they usually enjoy them.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / As They Say In Europe: Please drive Caerphilly - James
Morgan examines an attempt to measure quality of life in different parts of
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'EUROPE of Regions' is one of those dreams that provides a useful standby
for all kinds of commentators on the Community scene. The attractions of
this dream derive from its evocation of cheery images of Burgundians and
Bavarians exchanging tales of heroic drinking and cholesterol cuisine.
The trouble is that some nations have regions and some do not as was amply
demonstrated by this week's publication Regional Trends from Britain's
Central Statistical Office. Britain contains four countries but no regions,
merely what someone in Whitehall would probably call 'Areas of
Administrative convenience'. Thus we English live in the east Midlands and
the north west. The Dutch live entirely in such AACs, but they probably
prefer it that way. The Portuguese, the Danes and the Irish have nothing but
Portugal, Denmark and Ireland.
The French have fabricated some nice bits of country but for the real thing
you have to go to Italy and above all Germany. Their regions inspire the
dullest mind - Lombardy and Rhineland-Palatinate, Abruzzi and Mecklenburg
and Western Pomerania. There one hears the heartbeat of history; Yorkshire
might achieve that, but in the hands of Whitehall it becomes Yorkshire and
Humberside.
If there is ever to be a Europe of regions, which are the most attractive?
This is where Regional Trends might be expected to provide an answer.
There is a general view in Britain that the place to live is anywhere but
Britain, but international statisticians disagree. This was revealed to me
while thumbing through a publication from the United Nations Development
Programme last month which put Britain at number 11 in the world in terms of
its quality of life. That was odd because it ranked 21 on the income scale;
no other industrial nation was able to sustain such a high quality lifestyle
on the basis of such relative poverty. Mind you, any survey which puts Japan
at number one must arouse considerable suspicion.
The niceness of Britain comes through in Regional Trends' European lifestyle
comparisons. Again the Brits may not be the richest, but they are not that
poor either. And they enjoy notable advantages: if you want to avoid being
run over, Britain is plainly the place to be. Wales in fact has the lowest
rate of road deaths of anywhere in the Community, which I find hard to
credit. If you want to be hit by a car Paris, unsurprisingly, is your
natural choice; it is three times more likely to happen there than in
London.
If one takes apparently similar regions there are more surprises in store.
South east England and North Rhine-Westphalia have about the same population
 -around 17m - in about the same area. Now if Regional Trends is right, the
south east English enjoy the higher standard of living. On the basis of the
purchasing power of their incomes they are 10 per cent better off than the
Rhenish Westphalians. Their babies are more likely to be born healthy and
each working person has fewer people to support. The Germans will suffer
(inevitably) far more car crashes, and will be nearly twice as likely to be
working in factories (those nasty, noisy places), something the English gave
up years ago. But North Rhiners and Westphalians are not as likely to be out
of work, not yet anyway.
The regions of Europe of which people dream are probably Provence, Tuscany
and the south of Spain. Well, the last of these is all right, judging by the
figures, but on no account look for work there for it has the worst
unemployment rate in the Community. Provence and central Italy are so
favoured as retirement locations that scarcely anybody but the over-65s
seems to live there. But all these Latin idylls suffer the disadvantage on
which Regional Trends puts such insistent emphasis - danger on the roads.
Even by local standards they seem unusually well stocked with wrecks and
corpses.
One is left wondering if the compilers of this fascinating volume
deliberately selected their international comparisons to create that image
of a 'nation at ease with itself' of which the prime minister, John Major,
spoke once, and only once. Come to Britain, enjoy its active, youthful
population, its fine babies and careful drivers.
But a Europe of regions is not to be fashioned from the demographer's
computer. At least not according to those Arcadians whose columns decorate
the more conservative weekly journals in Britain. Their vision has no time
for comparative unemployment figures, but emphasises the qualities of local
alcoholic beverages, specialites du pays, and vernacular architecture.
The curiosity is that this dream is so widespread among anti-Maastricht
nationalists who live in a country which has virtually eliminated the
possibility of achieving the regional vision. If you really care about
creating a healthy regionalism you should probably be a Euro-federalist.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Women still suffering pension
discrimination - How part-timers and the low-paid are penalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIRECT discrimination by company pension schemes against women employees
continues unabated in the UK, in spite of the general drive towards equal
pensions for all. One particular practice, known as 'integration,'
effectively bars many thousands of women from access to occupational scheme
benefits.
Integration, in this context, involves an occupational pension scheme which
only makes payments after allowing for a notional level of state benefit.
Those women who suffer from the practice tend to be low earners who are not
entitled to a full state pension.
In 1986, the European Court of Justice ruled on a case where a German
company excluded part-timers from its scheme. Since most of them were
female, the court stated that the company had discriminated indirectly
against women.
About half the final salary schemes in the UK are integrated. Final salary
schemes calculate the individual's pension as a proportion of salary at
retirement. Typically, where a scheme is integrated, the value of the state
pension or the lower earnings limit for national insurance - both worth
about Pounds 3,000 - is deducted from the employee's final salary before the
occupational pension is calculated.
In effect, this means where a single integration factor is used, employees
would not receive any occupational pension for the first Pounds 3,000 of
their final salary.
According to the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), about
one-fifth of schemes apply a high integration factor where one and half
times - or even twice - the value of the state pension is deducted before
the company pension is calculated. In the latter situation, an employee
would receive no company pension for the first Pounds 6,000 of his or her
final salary.
Tina Norris, manager of pensions research at actuary and consultant Noble
Lowndes, says: 'This obviously works against low earners and the problem
particularly affects women, especially part-timers. In this respect,
integration could be regarded as a form of indirect discrimination.'
Trade unions have been active in trying to abolish integration. Paul
Moloney, pensions officer at the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union
explains: 'We feel integration is indirectly discriminatory, particularly
where it is not applied on a pro rata basis. Where a high integration factor
is used, this means that although, in theory, part-time employees are
allowed to join the scheme, in practice there is no point.'
Employers who use integration argue that their aim is to provide an overall
level of retirement income, and that it makes sense to take into account
what the state pays already. They also argue that it can be possible to
'over-provide' where integration is not used. This means that the low-paid
scheme member ends up with a combined state and occupational pension higher
than his or her final salary.
But Paul Greenwood, head of actuarial research at employee benefits
consultant William M. Mercer, says cases of over-provision have become
increasingly rare since the reduction in the real value of state pensions
since 1979 when the government linked annual increases to prices rather than
wages inflation.
Moreover, where employees' earnings fall below the lower earnings limit for
National Insurance contributions, they will not build up a right to a state
pension because, due to family commitments, they have long periods out of
employment.
Around 500,000 women continue to pay the reduced rate of National Insurance
contribution - known as the married woman's stamp - which does not build up
a right to the state pension.
Where a woman is not entitled to a state pension in her own name, she can
claim a smaller pension based on her husband's entitlement, although even
this is vulnerable if she changes her marital status.
In spite of the German case, UK law on indirect discrimination is unclear.
All forms would have been outlawed under a provision of the Social Security
Act 1989 which was due to come into effect in January this year. However
this was dropped by the department of social security, which preferred to
wait for an equal pensions case involving the Coloroll company to go to the
European Court.
The court gave an 'opinion' on this at the end of April, with the final
judgment expected later this year. While the opinion cleared up confusion
about the date from which equal occupational pensions for men and women must
be implemented, it did not refer specifically to the issue of indirect
discrimination.
But Mark Grant, a solicitor with McKenna &amp; Co. which is acting for the
company, says: 'The guiding principle behind Coloroll is that all elements
of sex discrimination are outlawed. The problem is that the law on sex
discrimination in occupational pensions schemes in the UK has developed
piecemeal. What we need now is a Coloroll Act or Pensions Act that will
clarify the position on all aspects of direct and indirect discrimination.'
Meanwhile, employees should check with the pension scheme manager or
trustees to see if their scheme is integrated. Fortunately, employee
contributions are based only on pensionable pay - that is, the portion of
salary above the integration level. Bear in mind that integration relates
only to the basic state pension and has nothing to do with the State
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps).
When you come to assess the impact of integration on your pension, pensions
consultant Alan Pickering stresses: 'It is vital to see the problem in
context.'
Pickering, of employee benefits consultant R Watson &amp; Sons, adds: 'Different
pension schemes build up at different rates and it may be that, if your
scheme has a high accrual rate, this will compensate - at least in part -
for the integration factor.'
The recession has accelerated the impact of integration. Pickering says:
'The problem is particularly acute for the growing number of employees who
are forced to retire early as part of a redundancy programme. These people
face a double blow.
'First, even if their occupational pension is not 'actuarially reduced'
because of early-leaver provisions, it is based on a much shorter employment
period and, therefore, will be considerably less than the pension available
at the normal retirement date.
'But, in addition, where integration applies, the reduction to take account
of the state pension kicks in immediately, even though it may be some years
before the individual actually starts to draw the pension at age-60 for
women and age-65 for men.'
If, due to integration, you expect to get very little from your company
pension, it could be worth considering a personal pension. Due, however, to
the high level of charges on most life office plans, these arrangements tend
to represent poor value to low earners making small contributions, so it is
important to seek expert advice.

THE NATIONAL Consumer Council this week published a report highlighting
shortcomings in two ombudsmen schemes designed to help consumers resolve
disputes without resorting to legal action.
The report was based on a sample of nearly 1,000 consumers who had used the
insurance ombudsman bureau and the office of the building societies'
ombudsman. About half questioned the independence of the schemes, although
their opinion was influenced largely by whether they had won their cases.
Some 70 per cent of those who lost under the building societies scheme
believed it was unfair but 81 per cent of those who won disagreed.
Nevertheless, between 28-31 per cent of those who lost under both schemes
still thought them fair. About 43 per cent of those complaining to the
building societies' office found it took an 'unreasonably long time to make
a decision' and 20 per cent of those using the insurance ombudsman agreed.
Complainants must go through the internal complaints system of the building
society or insurance company before approaching the ombudsmen but half those
surveyed said they found this 'a complete waste of time.'
The average time taken for disputes to be settled - including that taken by
internal complaints procedures - was 52 weeks in the case of the insurance
ombudsman and 91 weeks for the building societies' arbiter.
The NCC suggests the ombudsmen should be given greater powers to speed up
and set minimum standards for the internal complaints procedures of member
companies. It also recommends establishing an independent organisation to
oversee all ombudsman schemes.
In general, though, those surveyed thought the schemes were approachable and
cheap.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Timing - the key to success - Doing
the Splits / A trust with sound investment performance and simple structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEMING Income &amp; Capital investment trust was launched in March 1992, just
before the general election. The stock market was then fairly depressed by
the prospect of a Labour victory; as a result, the launch raised Pounds 92m,
much less than the Pounds 246m achieved by M &amp; G Income (covered in this
series last week).
But, in terms of investment performance, the issue has turned out to be
reasonably well-timed. According to manager Tony Nutt, the trust was
launched 'sufficiently far through the recession that we had a better chance
of spotting those companies which were going to cut their dividends.'
FICIT has a relatively simple structure, by split capital trust standards.
There are only two separate classes of share: zero dividend preference and
ordinary income.
This, says Nutt, should ensure no conflict of interest between the various
classes of shareholders. At the launch date, the trust already had
sufficient assets to repay the zero dividend preference shares. As a result,
Nutt can concentrate on earning a good return for the ordinary income
shares.
The zeros pay no income but have first claim on the assets of the trust.
Their capital entitlement, 30p at launch, increases by 11 per cent per annum
to reach 85.2p by the wind-up date in 2002.
Having been offered at 30p at launch, the zeros have jumped to 42p within 15
months, a gain of 40 per cent. However, the zeros were originally on offer
only to institutions, so the bad news for private investors is that none
will have enjoyed the full gain.
At the present price, Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg
Securities, estimates that the zeros are trading on a gross redemption yield
of 8.49 per cent.
'They are not the cheapest zeros in the world but they are correctly priced
and they are very safe' says Aaron, noting that the trust has assets equal
to 128 per cent of the final redemption price.
The ordinary income shares are entitled to all the income of the trust and
to the remaining assets once the zero shareholders have been repaid. At the
Thursday share price of 74.5p, the shares had a gross yield of 8.1 per cent.
Although they carry the title 'ordinary income,' it would be a mistake to
view them as the same type of investment as shares in a conventional trust,
such as Foreign &amp; Colonial. The existence of the zeros, rising remorselessly
at 11 per cent per annum, means that the ordinary income shares are a geared
investment.
The share price performance of the income shares rather suffered in the
early months of the trust's life, reaching a low of 47p in October. The sale
of a substantial institutional stake proved a drag on the price during this
period.
But the stock market rally which followed the pound's departure from the
exchange rate mechanism helped the income shares to rebound past 70p by the
year-end.
At a price of 74.5p, ordinary income shareholders have seen only a modest
6.5 per cent gain in price since the trust's launch. In part, this is
because it has had to earn back the launch expenses of around 4 per cent.
But they have also received a net dividend of 4.725p, taking the total
return for personal equity plan investors past 15 per cent.
The net asset value of the ordinary income shares, at the present repayment
value of the zeros, was 75.97p as of June 9. Allowing for the final
repayment value of the zeros, however, the asset value was only 24.95p.
Warburg's Aaron estimates that the assets of the trust will have to grow at
5.2 per cent per annum for ordinary income shareholders to get back the
present share price. If both assets and dividends grow at 5 per cent per
annum, then Aaron estimates investors will get a gross redemption yield of
9.78 per cent a year.
It was no coincidence that the trust was launched at the end of the tax year
when investors thoughts' tend to turn to the need to use up their annual
personal equity plan allowance.
At the time of the launch, an investment trust new issue was the only way
investors could get a full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance into a
collective fund. Accordingly, nearly 56 per cent of the ordinary income
shares are held in Pep form.
Such investors should note that the gross dividend could well fall this year
because of the Budget changes which reduced the tax credit to Pep investors.
In addition, there are units, which comprise one zero and one ordinary
income share. These effectively resemble shares in a conventional investment
trust.
At the Thursday price of 117.5p, the units have a gross yield of 5 per cent.
The assets per unit were 110.15p, putting the trust on a premium of around
6.7 per cent.
The breakdown of the portfolio by sector is: financial groups (23.6 per
cent); utilities (19.2 per cent); consumer goods (19 per cent); other groups
(18.1 per cent); oil and gas (11.4 per cent); and capital goods (8.7 per
cent).
The portfolio yield is designed to be 30 per cent higher than that
prevailing on the FT-A All-Share index. Accordingly, the present yield is
5.4 per cent, boosted by the trust's 11.9 per cent holding in convertible
bonds and convertible preference shares.
The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio at March 31 were: British
Telecommunications, Commercial Union, South West Water, National Westminster
Bank, British Gas, BOC, LASMO, Tomkins, Blue Circle and Shell.
Nutt says the trust moved heavily into utilities following the launch and,
later in the year, bought financial stocks, which tend to be beneficiaries
in the early stages of the economic cycle.
He adds that the trust will now look to move into stocks which have already
cut their dividends to a point which gives scope for future growth.
Warburg's Aaron says that the trust has, thus far, been one of the successes
of the split capital sector because of a decent investment performance since
launch and a less risky structure.
Key facts
The total assets of FICIT were Pounds 101.3m, as of June 9. The trust is due
to be wound up in March 2002. The annual management fee is 0.7 per cent of
net assets per annum.

The chairman is Charles Nunneley, also chairman of the board of the
Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.
Other directors are: John Emly, a director of Fleming Investment Management;
Ernest Fenton, director-general of the Association of Investment Trust
Companies; Alan Haddon, director of Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management; and
Antony Hichens, chairman of MB-Caradon.
Savings scheme and Pep details
The personal equity plan is available only on the ordinary income shares and
on the units.
The minimum monthly investment is Pounds 100 and the minimum lump sum is
Pounds 1,000. The initial charge is 1.5 per cent plus VAT, and there is also
a dealing charge of 1 per cent. The annual management charge is Pounds 25
plus VAT.
The savings scheme has a minimum monthly contribution of Pounds 40. The
minimum lump sum is Pounds 400 initially and Pounds 100 for subsequent

FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Overseas earnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS the position on overseas earnings when the period overseas does not
cover a complete tax year? My son-in-law is taking part in a 12-month job
exchange. He left early in January with his family, intending to return late
in January 1994. Will his overseas earnings be subject to UK tax?
There is some possibility that the other party to the exchange will not
complete the 12 months, so that my son-in-law might have to return late in
December. What would be the taxation implications?
In addition, his house has been let. Does a shorter let than 12 months
affect the tax position?
If his 'qualifying period' (as defined in Schedule 12 to the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988) does not consist of at least 365 days, his
earnings overseas will be fully taxable in the UK. The circumstances in
which his earnings may escape the UK tax net are outlined in a free
pamphlet, IR58 (Going to work abroad), which is obtainable from most tax
offices. The relief is statutory - it is not a concession.
If the rent on the family home is paid direct to his bank account,
presumably the tenant is deducting 25 per cent income tax from each payment.
On the other hand, if the rent is being paid to an agent in the UK, the rent
is doubtless being paid in full.
If your son-in-law has not seen them yet, you could also ask the tax office
for the free pamphlets IR87 (Rooms to let: income from letting property),
IR123 (Mortgage interest relief: buying your home) and CGT4 (Capital gains
tax: owner-occupied houses). If it looks as though his overseas earnings may
be taxed in the UK as well as in the country in question you could ask for
pamphlet IR6 (Double taxation relief).

FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deed of covenant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE a deed of covenant for my grandchildren (I pay Pounds 20 monthly).
For more than two years, the children have been in Oman with their parents.
Could you please confirm that no claim can be made for a tax refund because
they are (apart from holidays) resident abroad?
Since your grandchildren are (presumably) Commonwealth citizens, they are
entitled to the same personal allowances while resident overseas as they
would be if they were living in the UK.
Their parents should write to the Inland Revenue Claims Branch
(International), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB,
giving (if possible) the name and reference of the tax district at which the
children's previous claims were dealt with, so that their files may be
transferred to Claims Branch. You might also like to ask your tax office for
the free booklet IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the
UK). Tax allowances for non-residents are explained in chapter 8 on page 32.
(This reply is based on the assumption that the deed was executed before
March 15 1988, and received by a tax office before July 1988).

FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A loan - or just a gift?
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I HOLD a second charge certificate
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 20,000 - against a property that my step-daughter has recently
secured via an ordinary mortgage. I do not expect this 'loan' to be reduced
and might soon wish to waive the charge. Will the Pounds 20,000 be treated
as a gift for inheritance tax purposes?
My wife and I wonder how to protect my step-daughter from this second charge
in the event of our sudden deaths. We have not made provision for it in our
wills. We would leave estate of around Pounds 140,000. If my step-daughter
dies intestate, would 'her' property need to be sold to repay the second
charge?
We assume that you have loaned Pounds 20,000 to your step-daughter and have
a charge over her house. At present, on your death, the loan would form part
of your estate.
As the total value of the estate of yourself and your wife is Pounds
140,000, this loan would bring the estate just over the nil rate band of
Pounds 150,000; thus, Pounds 10,000 would be taxable on the death of the
survivor, giving rise to an IHT charge of Pounds 4,000.
Since you and your wife each have a nil rate band of Pounds 150,000, why not
divide your assets in such a way that you each make a gift of half the loan
on your respective deaths. Then, no IHT would be chargeable as the total
gifts would be covered by the nil rate bands.
If your estate was divided appropriately so that, together with the gift of
the loan to your daughter, your individual assets still fell below the nil
rate band of Pounds 150,000, no IHT would be paid.
Unless action is taken, though, the executors of your estate could force the
loan to be repaid on your death.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The need for facts - Diary of a
Private Investor / Shareholders are being sold short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A PRIVATE investor, I find it very easy to miss some of the warning
signals which an institutional investor can notice much more readily. Take
Toye &amp; Company, in which I had a small shareholding for a number of years.
It gave shareholders a useful 15 per cent discount on jewellery and other
items at its retail outlets. I thought the company had a profitable niche
activity: the manufacture and sale of civil and military regalia. I also
believed it had takeover potential.
At 4.27 pm on Friday, April 30, however - the day before the bank holiday
weekend - the stock exchange received and released details of Toye's
dreadful figures for the year ended December 31 1992. Institutional
investors could see this information on their monitor screens but the poor
private investor had to rely on the press or direct contact from the
company.
But the timing of Toye's release meant it was not picked up by the press.
And Toye, like most companies in a similar situation, did not send a
circular to its shareholders; instead, it waited until its annual report had
been printed and sent them that. Thus, the first many of them knew of Toye's
Pounds 1,051,438 loss (compared with a profit the previous year of Pounds
203,401) was when the report dropped through their letter boxes on June 2.
By then, Toye's shares had fallen from 130p on April 30 to 100p.
Toye's interim report, published on October 30, had revealed half-year
losses of Pounds 659,718. The chairman's statement pointed out some of the
problems the company faced, outlined the action it was taking and said: 'The
company expects to curtail the losses by the end of the second half-year.'
So, investors knew they might face a bumpy ride, and the shares fell from
190p in late October to 165p in January. By the end of March, though, the
price had dropped to 145p, and by April 22 it was 140p. The next day, it
plunged by another 10p. Which led me to wonder . . .
Last year, Toye announced its full-year results on April 24. Did someone,
this year, ask the company for the date of its announcement? And did that
someone sell out after discovering the results were to be announced on the
day before the bank holiday weekend - and drawing the conclusion they would
be bad?
In April, I had overlooked that Toye's results were due.
It was mid-May before I remembered, and when I 'phoned one of my
stockbrokers to ask what had happened, I was surprised to be told the
results had been released already. As soon as I got the details, I sold most
of my shares, achieving 128p for my modest holding.
Toye is a small company and its share dealings take place via SEATS: the
Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service. Dealing spreads can therefore be
sizeable.
I am determined not to be caught out again and have written down the dates
of expected interim and final announcements for companies in which I have
shares. But I feel also that the authorities should insist that when
companies announce bad news to the stock exchange, they should at the same
time mail details to all shareholders by first-class post. Just a photocopy
of the statement to the exchange would suffice.
Another warning sign I should have noticed about Toye was its change in
definition of its activities. In the 1990 report, this stated simply: 'The
manufacturing and sale of civil and military regalia ..'
In 1991, this changed to: 'The group operates in one principal area of
activity, that of identity.' Such 'PR-speak' should have alerted me to the
dangers ahead. Toye's activities had not changed - just the way they were
described.
Looking back over the years, there are several other warning signs that have
alerted me to potential problems with various companies. A move to plush new
headquarters, or the chief executive's involvement with various government
quangos, can sometimes indicate problems ahead.
So, too, can the sudden appointment of members of the 'great and the good'
to the board. Why does the company need window-dressing?
Another good indicator is looking at the announcements of directors' share
dealings. Hefty share sales by them can, quite often, presage a slump in a
company's share price.
Every Saturday, the Weekend FT has a column of Directors' Transactions
produced by Directus Ltd (1 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 7UP). It can
also provide private investors with a more detailed weekly and monthly
services.
Another service is Press Watch, which summarises the coverage given to major
companies in the UK's national newspapers. Each company has points awarded
(or taken away) depending on how much praise or criticism they get.
This annual publication costs Pounds 350 and is obtainable from Press Watch,
Bridge House, 126a High Street, Whitton TW2 7LL. The company also publishes
a quarterly guide at Pounds 425 a year.
Theoretically, if a company receives a bad press its shares ought to go
down; this can be used as an indicator of when to sell. A good press should,
at least in the short term, make the shares perk up - but this does not
necessarily mean a company will perform well. It could be that it simply has
skilled PR professionals, or perhaps no one has taken too close a look at
it.
There are other sources of information, although many are so costly that
only institutions can afford them. It is, therefore, crucial that companies
recognise they have a duty to all their shareholders and distribute
corporate information as widely and rapidly as possible.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Action on home income victims - SIB
admits warnings were tardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTIMS of home income plans who have not yet contacted the regulatory
authorities are being urged to come forward and register their complaints.
The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulatory body for
the financial services industry, has drawn up a fact sheet which is
available from its headquarters and from citizens advice bureaux.
This outlines the grounds on which victims may be entitled to compensation.
SIB has also set up a help desk.*
Investment-linked home income schemes were devised late in the 1980s as a
way for (mostly elderly) investors to unlock capital in their homes. The
idea was to take out a mortgage and invest the proceeds in the hope of
earning a return large enough to meet the repayments as well as providing
extra income.
Many advisers backed the plans with single-premium investment bonds. When
the value of these fell because of poor stock market performance, and
interest rates rose, investors ran into financial difficulties which were
compounded by the continuing slump in the housing market.
Many of the schemes were sold as 'safe' investments, with people unaware of
the risks. Investors spent the money they received in the belief that it was
interest on their home's capital but, actually, they were consuming the
capital itself.
So far, SIB has received 1,527 complaints, with a further 160 in the
pipeline. A total of Pounds 23m has been paid to just over 1,900 investors,
but many victims have been hit by the inconsistencies of the compensation
system.
Those who were sold the policy by a member of Fimbra (the self-regulatory
organisation for independent financial advisers), which then went into
default, have recourse under the Investors Compensation Scheme. This limits
the maximum payout per claim to Pounds 48,000, and is not obliged to return
people to the position in which they would have been had they not invested.
But those who dealt with a member of Lautro (the SRO for the life industry)
do not have a compensation ceiling, and Lautro members in breach of the
rules must ensure that clients are not worse off because of their
investments. Lautro members have paid Pounds 8m to 920 home income
investors.
SIB does not expect many more claimants. Chairman Andrew Large says: 'We
believe the worst is now over but, before we can close this chapter, I want
to be sure that all investors who have suffered in this way are identified
and encouraged to take appropriate action.'
Although SIB's move is welcome, its fact sheet - which also details the
risks involved - is a little belated. SIB admitted this week that, with
hindsight, the initial measures taken to deter the sale of these
highly-risky plans may have been wrong.
The regulators first expressed concern about the way the plans were marketed
in 1989, but it was not until 1990 that Fimbra and Lautro wrote to their
members reminding them of their duty to recommend only policies suitable for
each customer's specific needs.
But the lack of public warnings meant that unauthorised firms were able to
sell the products, with investors unaware of their dangers. A year later,
the sale of investment-linked home income plans was, effectively, banned by
both SROs.
'This has been a dreadful episode,' says Large. 'I want to ensure that
everyone who has suffered . . . is appropriately compensated.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking the risk out of travelling -
Bethan Hutton investigates holiday insurance policies and finds that not all
are the same
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLOUGHING through the small print of travel insurance policies might be
off-putting when planning a holiday, but it is not safe to assume that all
policies are the same.
If your shiny new camcorder is stolen on its first outing abroad, you could
find yourself with the option of claiming under three or four different
policies. Travel insurance is the most obvious but there is also your home
contents policy (if you have all-risks cover) and automatic, short-term
cover if you bought the camera with a credit card. If it is stolen from your
vehicle, you might also have a claim under your car insurance.
If, however, you decide on impulse to go scuba diving one day during your
holiday, and are unlucky enough to injure your foot on a coral reef, you
might not be covered at all. Most travel insurance covers theft of
possessions, but it often excludes injuries received during activities
considered dangerous, such as diving or mountain climbing, unless you have
made special arrangements.
Before you can choose a travel policy, you need to know where you are going,
what you will be doing there, what you will be taking with you, and for what
you are insured already.
Unlike all-risks household insurance, travel insurance is unlikely to
provide new-for-old cover for your possessions. There could be a relatively
low limit for individual items, which could mean that your expensive watch
(or even designer luggage) is best left at home.
Look through your existing (non-travel) policies to see what is covered. If,
for example, your all-risks cover excludes the part of the world to which
you are travelling, you need a travel policy giving adequate cover for
everything you take.
Some insurers give a discount on their travel premiums if you opt out of
baggage insurance because you feel your home contents policy provides enough
all-risks cover for that.
National &amp; Provincial, for one, charges 20 per cent less.
Medical expenses are probably the most important element of travel
insurance. An E111 form, available from the post office, entitles you to
reciprocal medical care in Europe.
This reduces the cost of treatment but will not necessarily make it free -
and it certainly will not pay for emergency repatriation by air ambulance.
A recent report in Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, recommended
having at least Pounds 250,000 worth of medical cover for trips in Europe,
and Pounds 1m for the US and elsewhere. Most policies have a maximum at
least this high, but check to be sure.
If you have an existing medical condition, be sure to read the small print
before buying a policy. Pre-existing conditions are covered by most but you
might need to tell the insurer and confirm you are not travelling against
medical advice.
Older people with a taste for adventure may have a hard time finding
suitable holiday insurance. Plenty of policies for travel within Europe have
no age limit, but premiums often double for people over 65 travelling to the
US or elsewhere. Thomas Cook, though, has no age limits on any policy: an
80-year-old pays the same as a two-year-old.
If you are planning a package holiday, it is worth investigating various
types of travel insurance before booking. You could be pressed by the travel
agent to accept the tour operator's own policy, which might not be the best
for your circumstances. Do not sign up unless you are sure it is suitable.
Some people think they need only pay for their holiday by credit card to be
covered fully. Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Free travel
accident cover is provided by Barclays when its Visa, MasterCard or Premier
clients pay for their holidays with the card - but this applies only while
they are travelling, not to accidents elsewhere. Possessions are covered
only if they were bought with the card fewer than 100 days before.
Annual insurance policies, which cover you for unlimited numbers of trips
lasting less than two or three months, have become more common - and more
affordable - recently. If you go abroad more than once a year, they are
definitely worth considering, particularly if you go skiing or travel with
your family.
First Direct's (0345-100100) annual world-wide policy for two adults and two
children costs Pounds 99, and covers unlimited skiing within the limit of 90
days a trip. Insurance for the same group for a two-week holiday in the US
is likely to cost at least Pounds 80. If you do not intend to holiday
outside Europe, Frizzell (0202-292333) offers a comprehensive annual policy
for Pounds 48.15 per adult.
Terrorist attacks, or riots in a previously idyllic holiday spot, are every
tourist's nightmare. If, say, you had been injured in the Florence car
bombing last month, some insurers would have paid up. Some, though, exclude
acts of terrorism so check the small print. Others may pay, but at their own
discretion.
If a civil war or rioting breaks out in your destination before you leave
home, call your insurer to check if your policy is still valid. If the
foreign office advises against travelling to an area, this could be enough
cause to cancel the holiday and make a claim.
If your idea of a good holiday is diving, mountaineering, white-water
rafting or bungee jumping, you might need to contact one of the companies
offering specialist activity holiday insurance.
Crispin Speers (071-480-5083), for instance, will cover activities such as
hang-gliding and abseiling for a Pounds 10 extension to its standard
policies. More dangerous activities will be considered individually.
Accident and General's (071-512-0022) ActivityGuard provides three levels of
cover, depending on the degree of danger.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD Appliances, the domestic appliances company that floated last June -
and made a profits warning three months later - is expected to report
preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.5m on Monday, up from Pounds
9.3m.
Despite a better second half and the acquisition of Tricom in Hong Kong last
November, earnings per share are unlikely to be ahead as significantly as
expected by some at the time of the float.
The City will be keen to have an update on the restructuring programme at
FKI when the electrical engineering group reports annual results on Tuesday.
Bob Beeston, chief executive, has seen FKI's share price nearly treble in
value since he was brought in from BTR at the beginning of last year.
Analysts, who expect pre-tax profits to have risen from Pounds 31m to about
Pounds 37m, will also be interested in the state of the group's large US
automotive market.
Granada, the leisure, television and computer services group, is expected on
Wednesday to announce healthy pre-tax profits of about Pounds 67m for the 26
weeks to March 27. This will compare with Pounds 57m last time, although
that was for a 28-week period.
Modest progress is expected in both rental and television with about Pounds
5m profit, against Pounds 4.3m, expected for computer services. Noting that
investors were showing greater interest in the leisure sector, Bruce Jones,
leisure analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court, said they felt 'comfortable'
with Gerry Robinson, the chief executive.
NFC, the transport and logistics company, is set to report interim profits
on Wednesday of about Pounds 40m, virtually unchanged from a year ago.
Analysts will be watching for further signs of growth from its US logistics
business. They will also want to see the effects of the sale in January of
the company's waste management division. The sale will depress the transport
division's profits, but reduce significantly group interest costs over the
year.
Dawson International is due to report its results for the year to March 31
on Thursday. One of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, Dawson is
expected to double its profits to Pounds 32.5m. Earnings will grow to 13p
(10.4p) per share.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Dread disease: the insurance for
critical cases - Many people have never heard of this cover; yet, it can
cushion family or firm from serious financial trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DREAD disease: the very name is enough to put off anyone squeamish. But
although it has been available in Britain for several years, many people
have not heard of dread disease insurance, even under its other, less
Gothic-sounding name of critical illness insurance.
Basically, it is designed to pay a lump sum when one of a defined list of
serious illnesses is diagnosed, chief among them heart attacks, strokes and
cancer. While such problems are common, statistics show you are more likely
to contract a critical illness than to die before retirement age. Watsons,
the actuarial firm, says that a man aged 40 has a 1:12 chance of dying by
the age of 60 - but a 1:10 chance of getting such an illness.
The concept of this insurance stems from the fact that the impact of serious
illness on a family's finances can be worse than death.
Unlike life assurance, critical illness insurance pays out before death; the
illness does not have to be terminal. And, unlike permanent health
insurance, the amount paid out is not necessarily related to earnings or
inability to work.
Recipients are free to spend the lump sum how they choose: for instance, on
home nursing care, a holiday to recuperate, to pay off the mortgage, or to
make home alterations to take account of new disabilities. So far, the idea
seems simple and useful. But confusion arises when you start to look at the
details of individual policies.
Some also provide a death benefit; some acquire a cash value; some cover
illnesses that others do not; some allow partial payments on diagnosis of
certain less-serious conditions; some pay out when you become unable
permanently to do your own job, while others say you must be incapable of
doing any job. Most importantly, the definitions of the core illnesses can
vary in small but crucial details.
The one disease excluded by all the policies is Aids. Indeed, the only claim
any insurer will accept for an HIV-related illness (and only some will do
this) is if it can be proved the virus was contracted from a blood
transfusion in the UK while the policy was in force - something that is
highly unlikely given the rigorous screening procedures now adopted. But
haemophiliacs are excluded even from this.
Confusion over the level of cover provided by different insurers is one
reason that many independent financial advisers have been reluctant to deal
with critical illness insurance. So, in an attempt to clarify the sector, a
working party from the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers
has produced a list of standard definitions for the main conditions covered.
While only a handful of insurers - including Life Association of Scotland
and Friends Provident - has agreed to adopt the list so far, others are
considering it. At the least, the NFIFA is asking all insurers to make sure
their definitions are as extensive as the list by autumn this year.
Countrywide, one of the largest networks of IFAs, has examined most of the
60-odd policies on offer to check their definitions of key dread diseases.
It was looking for definitions that would give clients the best opportunity
to make a valid claim, which meant that those worded vaguely or too narrowly
were out.
Stuart Fulkes, one of Countrywide's researchers, said they had discovered
that seven conditions were most likely to attract claims. 'Others are
unlikely situations or marketing gimmicks. Policies should at least be
competent in the core areas - after that it is just a bonus.'
Countrywide found 16 companies with definitions it deemed acceptable: Allied
Dunbar, Cannon Lincoln, Commercial Union, Eagle Star, General Accident,
Guardian Royal Exchange, Liberty Life, London Life, Pegasus, PPP Lifetime,
Prolific, Scottish Amicable, Skandia Life, Sun Life, Windsor Life and Zurich
Life.
Medical jargon can also put off potential customers who want to know exactly
what a policy will cover. Several companies, including Allied Dunbar and
Life Association of Scotland, now provide a plain English guide - in
readable type - explaining their definitions.
As critical illness cover remains a relatively recent addition to insurers'
portfolios, new applications are still being invented for it, such as an
add-on to endowment policies. It can also be taken out by businesses as a
back-up to keyman life insurance. If a partner, director or other key
employee becomes seriously ill, the pay-out compensates the company for
their loss or allows their share of the business to be bought out.
Adrian Kemp, an employee benefits consultant with Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, sees
critical illness cover as particularly relevant to the executive and keyman
markets, but he also expects growth in the general sector. 'I think it is
going to be a developing market for the rest of the decade,' he says. 'We
will see significant innovations - possibly more insurers entering the
market, and that would be no bad thing.'
David Thompson, a director at IFA Noble Lowndes in Bristol, adds: 'The
attraction of critical illness cover is that an individual might not want to
work any more. If somebody is struck down by a heart attack through stress,
the last thing they want to do is go back to work.'

THE MAIN conditions covered by all critical illness policies are heart
attack, some types of heart surgery, cancer, stroke, kidney failure,
paralysis, and major organ transplant.
Definitions can, however, vary widely and a large number of other conditions
are covered by the different insurers.
The sum assured is usually backed by units in investment funds. Insurers
often quote two levels of premiums. 'Maximum' means that premiums and the
sum assured are guaranteed for a set time limit, usually five or 10 years;
after that, premiums can be expected to rise if the sum assured is not to
fall.
With 'standard' cover, the sum assured and premiums should remain steady for
life if the funds involved achieve growth at the projected rate. But, if
they do not, then any cash value built up might be used to make up the
shortfall, or the premiums may increase. Reviews normally take place every
five or 10 years.
Because of the complexity of the subject, you should always discuss your
needs with a financial adviser before making any decisions. The following is
a selection, not an exhaustive list, of companies offering critical illness
insurance.
The premiums quoted are for the most comprehensive standard cover for a male
non-smoker aged 40 next birthday, including death benefit, with a sum
assured of Pounds 100,000. But because levels of cover can be very
different, the premiums may not be comparable directly.
Abbey Life has offered critical illness insurance since 1987. It says it
will be moving to adopt the NFIFA's definitions at the first reasonable
opportunity, but its own definitions are very similar. Standard cover is
Pounds 126.35 a month.
Allied Dunbar's Lifestyle range of policies was re-launched in February.
Before doing so, the company looked at the definitions on which NFIFA was
working and says its own are at least as extensive. Premiums for Lifestyle
Plus, the most comprehensive cover, are Pounds 126.48 a month.
Cannon Lincoln was, in 1986, the first to offer critical illness cover in
the UK. Its Financial Foundations plan was launched last month to provide a
range of options such as permanent disability, long-term care and surgical
cash benefit cover, which can be combined in any pattern. The fullest cover
costs Pounds 122.85 on a standard premium basis.
Friends Provident has already adopted the NFIFA guidelines for critical
illness options on mortgages. Stand-alone policies are under review and,
when re-launched, the guidelines probably will be used. The premium for a
stand-alone policy is Pounds 132.25 a month.
Life Association of Scotland recently re-launched its Vitality policy, with
an expanded list of illnesses covered, and has adopted the NFIFA
definitions. Standard cover costs Pounds 128.63 a month.
Pegasus' critical illness policies were re-launched in 1991 with changes,
and additions have been made since then. Pegasus is planning to adopt at
least the equivalent of the NFIFA standard definitions.
It offers two levels of cover - Priority, limited to the core illnesses, and
Ultimate, including permanent disability etc. The monthly premium for
Priority is Pounds 103.35, and for Ultimate Pounds 127.05.
Prolific will be adopting standard definitions in its Self Assurance plan by
the end of the year, and for critical illness cover on its mortgage plan by
mid-July. It offers both personal and business policies. Personal cover
costs Pounds 104.49 a month.
Skandia Life is about to adopt the NFIFA definitions, including applying
them to existing policies, except where the existing definition is broader.
Cover under the Lifetime plan costs Pounds 126.36 a month.

PERPETUAL has proved itself capable of producing consistently above-average
performance from its fund management business and its shares have reflected
this success. They have outperformed the market by almost 280 per cent over
the past year, so it is hardly surprising that directors see this as an
opportunity to take profits. Robert Yerbury has sold 20,000 at 470p, leaving
him with just 53,000. By far the largest shareholder on the board is
chairman Martyn Arbib, with more than 18.5m.
Shares in Yorkshire Chemicals appear to have regained institutional favour
after dropping as low as 250p last September. Philip Lowe, the chairman and
managing director, has sold 100,000 at 385p, reducing his holding to 74,000.
The company completed a 1-for-5 rights issue in March, raising around Pounds
24m.
International Food Machinery came to the market last December and has
performed well. Announcing results for 1992, the board indicated that
first-quarter performance was satisfactory and that it was confident about
the rest of the year. Managing director John Holroyd and Sean Kelly have
sold 80,000 and 50,000 shares respectively at 68p.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Why Sir Ernest can smile - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ernest Harrison, with much glee, this week firmly put the doubting
Thomases back in their place. Chubb Security, Vodafone and Racal Electronics
 -the three companies he chairs after the last five years' demergers - all
reported sharply higher profits for the year to March 1993.
Basking in the applause, Sir Ernest allowed himself to muse about the
possibility that Chubb - capitalised at Pounds 865m - is not that far from
the FT-SE 100 index. If Chubb reached this pinnacle Sir Ernest would join a
select club who chair two Footsie companies built substantially by
themselves.
How plausible is this for Chubb? And what should shareholders with stakes in
all three companies expect now, however thrilled they are by what Sir Ernest
has achieved for them to date?
Vodafone, which reported profits of Pounds 322.5m up from Pounds 272m,
presents the clearest picture. A glimpse of the company's dominance of the
UK cellular telephone operator, market can be gleaned from its cash flow. At
58 per cent of turnover, Vodafone's cash generating ability is matched by
few companies.
Operating margins of 46 per cent give an equally revealing snapshot of how
its competitors have consistently failed to mount effective competition.
What is more, as economic recovery emerges, there seems to be scope for
further growth in its market and surprisingly little sensitivity about the
price subscribers are prepared to pay.
Racal Electronics - profits up from Pounds 16m to Pounds 52m - presents a
more mixed picture, as might be expected from a company once described by
Sir Ernest as the 'rump' of the Racal businesses. At the operating level,
almost all the improvement in profits last year emerged from a sharp
increase in margin in the Data Communications division, the largest
division.
Data communications produced margins of only 3.4 per cent on sales of Pounds
371m - including profits from high margin data network services.
Irrespective of how competitive this market is - and like the personal
computer market it is fiercely so - there is clearly scope for more
improvement here.
Elsewhere, Redac, the computer-aided design business which increased losses
last year, and should be turned around ready for disposal.
The potential of the other business is further down the track. The UK
government is about to award the Bowman communications contract for the
British army, which would be profitable to Racal later this decade; and the
group has won some exciting orders in its avionics division to put
telephones in aircraft.
What is most encouraging for shareholders is that Racal has started to
squeeze large quantities of cash out of what was a fairly relaxed
organisation before demerger.
On balance, Racal may not be the best recovery story around but the
management has a lot to play with.
Chubb Security's 64 per cent profits increase to Pounds 62m, has been a
story of cost cutting and margin improvement - another reminder to
shareholders how little the non-Vodafone businesses attracted management
attention in the past. David Peacock, new chief executive, is setting that
right and has stripped out working capital as well as enhancing margins.
There is more room for margin improvement - although the easy bit has
obviously been done.
Once the business has been licked back into shape, the secret will be
whether the electronic security side of the business can be grown. As the
company points out, rising crime should mean Chubb is selling into a growing
market but its own sales have yet to demonstrate this growth.
Chubb has always been cash generative - in the Racal family it took over the
role of banker to the group once Vodafone floated. But growing electronic
security requires a heavy capital spend in the initial phase. At the moment
Chubb appears to have a relatively modest capital expenditure.
If Sir Ernest is to fulfil the dream of making Chubb a Footsie company,
investment may need to increase and the group may need to move further into
the domestic market.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Paying a high price for poor earnings - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am delighted to hear from the Prime Minister that policy will not alter.
(Kenneth Clarke) will understand if I say that he thus comes to the Treasury
at a most favourable time. Much of the hard work has been done and he should
be able to enjoy increasingly encouraging trends for a long time to come.
Norman Lamont
House of Commons
INVESTORS are hoping for Norman Lamont's farewell prediction to come true
with as much fervour as they once clung to his promise of recovery ahead.
Few disagree with his judgment that 'the recession is now behind us'; the
fluttering hopes attach to his forecast of 'increasingly encouraging
trends'.
If trends do not continue to improve, the current level of the stock market
is hard to justify. A rash of brokers' circulars this Friday pointed out
that the price/earnings ratio for the FT-Actuaries '500' (the industrial and
commercial components of the All-Share index) had risen to more than 19,
above the level touched before the 1987 crash.
This rise is not due to any sudden spurt in the overall level of share
prices - as the chart shows, the market as a whole, heavily influenced by
the biggest companies, continues to move sideways. Rather, it is due to the
impact on the 'earnings' side of the p/e ratio of so many poor results over
the past few months.
The market tended to treat them phlegmatically because those results were
not much worse than had been expected, and because they could be seen as
exaggerated by the FRS3 accounting standard.
But by absolute standards, they were very poor: S G Warburg's figures show
reported earnings running nearly 12 per cent below the already depressed
level of a year ago.
Historic figures, of course, are just that: history. A more relevant number
is the prospective p/e ratio. Here, there has not yet been any great drift
upwards. The prospective figure for the calendar year 1993, calculated by
the IBES service in New York based on the consensus earnings expectations of
analysts around the world who follow London stocks, is 14.4.
That figure has remained almost unchanged since the FT first began reporting
it every Monday earlier this year. Still, it is only a comfortable multiple
if the profits growth that analysts expect indeed materialises; and if
profits continue to grow in later years.
Neither of those is a racing certainty. In the short run, reported earnings
could continue to deteriorate. Even when they bounce back, there may not be
as much resilience in the bounce as the market - and Norman Lamont - would
like to think.
One ominous sign was the results of Pilkington, announced on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits for the financial year just ended were down from Pounds 96m
to Pounds 41m, on sales more or less unchanged at Pounds 2.6bn. The dividend
 -cut a year ago for the first time since the company went public in 1970 -
was cut again, by a third. There had been some encouraging signs, said Sir
Antony Pilkington the group's chairman, especially the 'amazing' impact of
sterling's devaluation on UK competitiveness. But there was also 'a dramatic
collapse' in the German market, where the situation remains uncertain.
Pilkington is, perhaps, unusually unfortunate: its shareholders could be
forgiven for wondering how they seem to have missed out on the German boom
while catching the full force of the recession. Since BTR's abortive bid for
the company in 1987, Pilkington has underperformed the All-Share by 61 per
cent.
But its woes are not all sui generis. Other British companies which
struggled to raise their exposure to continental Europe during the single
market Europhoria are also suffering the consequences.
The market's worries about European growth are one important influence on
the truly remarkable divergence of the lines shown in the chart. The big
companies in the FT-SE 100 have gone nowhere for weeks, while the smaller
companies in the Mid 250 and SmallCap - which derive a much greater
proportion of their sales and profits from the UK domestic economy - have
continued to race ahead.
The continued flow of rights issues from medium-sized companies has done
little to dent this sentiment. On Thursday, for example, Wimpey announced a
one-for-four issue at a discount of 21 per cent, to raise Pounds 104m.
The company said it would be using the proceeds to buy land for
housebuilding - the sort of statement that would have sent shareholders
stampeding for the exit only nine months ago. This year, encouraged by the
near trebling of the share price since September, investors were prepared to
view the prospect with equanimity: the share price slipped only 3p on the
day of the announcement, to 184p. It closed on Friday at 178p, a fall of 1p
on the week.
Also basking in shareholders' approval this week were the three companies
that once formed part of Sir Ernest Harrison's empire: Racal, Vodafone and
Chubb. All reported strong earnings, allowing Sir Ernest to wrong-foot the
critics who jeered at his promise to enrich shareholders by splitting up the
company: the components of the old Racal have together healthily
outperformed the market since the first spin-off in 1988.
Politics is harsher than business: Norman Lamont did not survive in office
long enough to enjoy such revenge. How much he enjoys his time on the back
benches will depend, in part, on whether he is right in believing that his
policies will survive his departure. Kenneth Clarke's speech to the
white-tie-and-tails ranks of the City on Tuesday will give the first
detailed answer to that. Like the stock market, the new Chancellor perhaps
has a nervous suspicion that the times are not quite as favourable as his
predecessor makes out.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Retail sales catch a bad case of anaemia - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOUD, wooshing sound echoing around the canyons of Wall Street yesterday
was thousands of dealers and investors exhaling at the same time. They had
been holding their collective breath all week, fearing that a strong
producer prices index number on Friday would prompt the Federal Reserve into
raising interest rates as a precautionary measure against inflation.
Low interest rates have sustained stock and bond markets - and Wall Street's
profits - for two years, so any reversal in rates would represent an
extremely unwelcome start to summer. Yet, when the PPI was published, those
fears proved unfounded.
Wholesale prices did not budge during May and the 'core' PPI, which excludes
the volatile components of food and energy prices, rose only 0.2 per cent,
no more than analysts had expected. The relief was palpable. Bond prices
rallied and the Dow Jones index surged at the opening bell, rising 25 points
in the first 30 minutes before dropping back later.
Analysts did not have to look far for an explanation for May's flat
inflation numbers. Also released yesterday were the May retail sales figures
 -and they were disappointingly weak. Sales rose only 0.1 per cent last
month and were unchanged, excluding the car sales figures.
Although the April sales numbers were revised upward slightly, analysts were
still surprised by the anaemic May data, which suggested that consumer
demand remains subdued despite the fact that the economy is into its second
year of recovery. What inflation, sales (and even the recent employment)
figures point to is a low-growth, low-inflation economic recovery - exactly
what the less excitable of Wall Street's economists have been forecasting
for the better part of a year.
Dealers were not the only ones sweating over the inflation numbers. The
White House this week kept up its pressure on the Fed not to make any hasty
moves on monetary policy. On Wednesday, President Clinton met Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to repeat the administration's view that the
Budget deficit and the lack of economic growth, not inflation, are the
central problems facing the country.
Just to make sure the Fed got the message, commerce secretary Ron Brown said
yesterday that the May producer prices figures were 'solid evidence that
higher interest rates are unnecessary, given the current state of the
economy.'
While such comments were aimed as much at the financial markets as they were
at the Fed, Greenspan is unlikely to take such a sanguine view of the
inflationary picture.
That picture is not yet developed fully, at least for the month of May,
because the consumer price index is not due to be released until next week.
If the Fed is to alter the emphasis of its monetary policy (which, in April,
was shifted towards a possible tightening after worryingly strong inflation
numbers were released), then it will come after the CPI surfaces.
This helps to explain why the stock markets' reaction to the positive PPI
data was, ultimately, so restrained. After an initial burst, share prices
fell back from their highs yesterday morning and by midday were languishing,
with only mildly impressive gains.
The relatively disappointing performance of stocks at the end of the week
was also a reflection of renewed concerns about the economic outlook -
concerns that were heightened by an unexpected profits warning from
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3M), a Dow stock that is viewed widely as
one of the best economic barometers in the market.
On Thursday, shares in 3M - an industrial conglomerate which makes products
that range from recording tape and office supplies to medical products and
chemicals - plunged 8.6 per cent after the company said second-quarter
earnings would fall short of market expectations. It blamed the slowdown in
the economy. The sharp slide in 3M dragged down the Dow as well - the entire
20-point drop was attributable to 3M's decline.
Another market leader warning about its profits outlook this week was Apple
Computer, one of the biggest stocks traded on the electronic Nasdaq market.
On Wednesday, Apple said its earnings in the second half of this year would
be less than those for the same stage of 1992.
Unlike 3M, however, Apple's sales are not struggling. The computer giant is
suffering from the fierce price war among personal computer manufacturers,
which is shrinking its profit margins.
Price wars, of course, are usually the result of too many sellers chasing
too few buyers. In other words, the weakness of consumer demand and the
economy is hurting Apple, just as it is 3M.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: The brighter side of bank charges - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT NOW looks inevitable that banks will reintroduce charges for those
customers who are in credit. Abbey National said this week that the move was
likely within a few months.
The banks have been nervously following a 'you first' approach to the issue.
Rather like the process of pre-Budget speculation about tax increases, the
hope may be that repeated airing of the prospect of change may diminish the
protests when change actually occurs.
The industry seems to be edging towards a flat monthly fee plus additional
charges for items such a stopped cheques. Chances are that the market will
fragment, with some groups offering 'free' banking to those who agree to
keep high minimum balances.
Given the current low levels of interest rates, it may be worth keeping a
high float to avoid the charges. If rates were to go back above 10 per cent,
then it would be a tricky calculation as to whether the interest foregone on
the float (if the same sum were kept in a savings account) outweighed the
charges.
Every week, our highest rates for your money table, produced by Moneyfacts,
gives details of high interest cheque accounts. The Chelsea Building
Society, for example, pays 6.1 per cent on those willing to keep a minimum
of Pounds 2,500 in their accounts.
Some of these accounts cannot be used for day-to-day dealings. For example,
Fidelity's cash unit trust gives a chequebook to those with more than Pounds
5,000, but cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250. So one strategy
could be to pay for as much as possible by credit card, and then pay off the
bill each month with a cheque out of a high interest account.
Charging tends to be a subject on which some people feel a sense of moral
outrage, perhaps because of the perception that banks are making their
customers pay for their mistakes in other areas such as property lending.
But banks, like any other business, will charge what they can get away with
in the market.
The only solution for aggrieved bank account holders is to be as adept at
shopping around as building society depositors. When Save &amp; Prosper
introduced a monthly charge on balances below Pounds 1,000, it found that
5,000 of the 6,000 customers affected closed their accounts.
Admittedly, it is more of a hassle switching bank accounts than it is moving
your savings, given all those direct debits which have to be changed.
The best deals are likely to come from those institutions with the lowest
costs, ie those which have not invested vast amounts of capital in a branch
network. Inevitably there will be some depositors who find they need the
convenience of their branch and who decide, however reluctantly, to put up
with the charges.
For the rest, it may be time to recognise that there is no need to have an
account with one of the big high street names. Other institutions may have a
service which suits your needs better, or perhaps, as with First Direct, you
may simply need to move to a different part of the same institution. There
are dangers in moving to a less well-known institution - remember BCCI. But
bank charges may be the alarm call which investors need to alert them to the
services they have been missing.
Investment trust groups are exploiting the sector's recently revived
popularity to raise new funds. Three particular areas of investment have
been attracting money: smaller companies, emerging markets and Japan.
Smaller companies are thought to be due for a revival after suffering from
the recession; emerging markets, it is argued, have greater prospects for
economic and corporate profit growth; and Japan has rebounded sharply from
the lows it reached last year.
In the small company field, there are issues from CW Asset Management (a
vehicle for Peter Webb, who used to run Thornton's smaller companies unit
trust) and a second indexed fund from Hoare Govett. In emerging markets,
following a spate of offers from existing trusts earlier in the year, John
Govett is launching a fund. And both Dunedin and Perpetual are floating
Japanese trusts.
There is a natural temptation for small investors to opt to buy shares in
new trust issues. Perhaps this is because it is easier to pick one new trust
than to choose from hundreds of existing funds. And it may be that managers
do better if they start with a clean slate.
But there are drawbacks to new issue investment. The costs involved in a new
issue often eat up 3 to 4 per cent of the launch capital, so that the
investor is nearly always buying shares at a premium. Given that it is
possible to buy shares in an existing trust, which have a published
performance record, at a discount, a new issue is automatically 'expensive'.
One strategy might be to wait for the trust to launch and fall to a discount
before buying. Of course, if every investor used this tactic, no new trusts
would be created.
Most trust launches now use devices to try to get round the discount problem
 -warrants, a limited life or a split capital structure. Nevertheless, if
you really want to invest in a particular area, it may be worth seeing if
there are well-established trusts available at a discount before taking the
plunge.

<TEXT>
Long-term fixed rate mortgages were launched this week by Prudential, the
life company. The rate of 9.69 per cent can be fixed for a period of 25
years (10.2 APR), 20 years (10.1 APR) or 15 years (9.9 APR). The fixed rates
are portable and are available on repayment, endowment and pension
mortgages. The arrangement fee is Pounds 250 but there is no compulsion to
buy insurance-related products. There is an early redemption penalty of 12
months gross interest.
Halifax has issued a range of new fixed rates available on all types of
mortgages, including a fixed rate for under 10 years (until January 31 2003)
at 9.35 per cent (9.5 APR). The arrangement fee is Pounds 300, and there are
early redemption penalties. The mortgages are portable after February 1994
and first time buyers have to buy insurance-related products.

The victory of the Socialists in the Spanish elections on June 6 prompted
falls on the general share index after a period of gains. Investors had
anticipated a conservative win and with that lower interest rates and a
weaker peseta. The Socialist election victory reduced the prospect of
interest rate cuts. The Spanish equity market has risen by 40 per cent since
its six year low point in October 1992, following the first devaluation of
the peseta.

The yen continued to rise sharply against the dollar this week defying
repeated intervention from the Federal Reserve. It reached a high of Y105.95
against the dollar to fall back a little by the end of the week.
Underpinning the yen's strength has been a US Treasury Department report in
May stating that a higher yen could help reverse Japan's huge trade surplus.
It was thought that the US would be calling for a strong yen at the trade
talks with Japan which began yesterday and at the summit next month of the
Group of Seven.

BEIJING: We are driving across the city's vast, central Tiananmen square in
Mr Zhao's Mercedes 280 SEL with its dark, tinted windows and car telephone.
Known widely throughout China as the 'hair lotion king,' he is in an
expansive mood. 'Call your friends anywhere in the world . . . call your
mother, call your wife,' he says, offering me the 'phone. I call my wife at
home in Beijing to tell her I will be late for an appointment.
The ebullient Mr Zhao is reminiscing now as we pass on the right the Gate of
Heavenly Peace, with its outsize portrait of Mao, and on the left the Great
Hall of the People, seat of China's parliament. Mr Zhao was elevated to
parliament recently for his money-making abilities. 'Getting selected for
parliament only ever appeared in my dreams from time to time,' he says,
reflectively. 'You know what they call me now? The Red Fat Cat.'
Mr Zhao is perhaps the best-known member of China's newest class ' the
entrepeneur or ge ti hu. He has certainly become one of the richest since he
began producing and marketing a hair-growth tonic that, he insists, has
achieved spectacular results.
Not so long ago, Mr Zhao's entrepreneurial activities would have been
scorned and his material success held as a black mark against him. Indeed,
the word ge ti hu was not even in common use before paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping began, late in the 1970s, to prise open China to the outside world
and declared that 'to get rich is glorious.'
Since those first, faltering steps towards a market economy with Chinese
characteristics, millions like Mr Zhao have taken the entrepeneurial, if not
capitalist, road. According to China's taxation bureau, 15.3m private
businesses had sprouted by the end of 1992 and the total is expected to
reach 30m by the year 2000.
Mr Zhao comes from a remote part of China that has itself become a symbol of
rampant commercialism. It is in places like the small, damp, coastal city of
Wenzhou, 300 kilometres south of Shanghai, that the quite awesome, almost
manic, energies being applied to making money and getting ahead are seen
best.
Wenzhou had no airport until recently and there is no railway, although one
is being built. Roads are rutted and, in spite of a rash of new buildings,
the place appears dilapidated: yet Wenzhou, population 1m, has far
outstripped most of the nation in per capita income and other indices of
improved living standards. Local officials attribute Wenzhou's remarkable
progress to the innate liveliness of coastal dwellers - and to hardship. As
Cai Yanjong, head of the local economic commission, noted: 'We have been
forced to be like this. In the past, Wenzhou was very poor. To improve
living standards, we had to do whatever was necessary.' Doing whatever was
necessary may well have involved bending official rules. Wenzhou, for
instance, established its own 'trust' banks - rather like building society
co-operatives ' long before the authorities allowed much flexibility at all
in the banking area.
Mr Zhao, a sprightly individual with a thick brush of dark hair, is a
perfect example of a Wenzhou rags-to-riches story. Born in 1943 to a poor
family that farmed medicinal herbs, he was destined to spend his life as a
lowly-paid accountant in a production brigade. But that was before he
discovered his true vocation preparing skin care potions and, later, the
hair tonic. The story of how he got started has an Alice-in-Wonderland
quality typical of China where fact and fantasy often are inter-twined.
In 1968, he sold his wife's jewellery and his house in Wenzhou for around
Pounds 110 to raise the money needed to buy the herbs for his preparations.
He began with what he claims is a successful acne treatment and the first
patient for his hair tonic - which he calls Formula 101 - was an attractive
young girl who, tragically, had lost her hair. Not only that - her wig had
fallen into a river and been swept away.
Enter gallant Mr Zhao. 'You provide the head, and I'll provide my herbs,' he
told her parents, before getting to work on finding the right formula. This,
he says, took him six years; and when, eventually, he found a mixture that
worked, he named it '101' because he had tried at least that many
combinations.
Today, the formula is guarded as jealously as that for Coca Cola, but Mr
Zhao does reveal it is based on 20 herbal ingredients, some gathered as far
afield as Tibet and Mongolia, which work by warming the scalp and improving
blood circulation.
Mr Zhao, whose hobbies include playing the lute and reading books on China's
5,000-old tradition of herbal cures, claims also to have developed an elixir
that removes greyness from hair. Many Chinese, including members of the
ageing leadership, will do almost anything to avoid going grey - to the
extent of using unsightly dyes that produce an effect like boot black. If Mr
Zhao has produced an oral medicine that makes hair dyes redundant, he should
be onto another winner.
Mr Zhao is perplexed by apparent western resistance to herbal cures.
'Outsiders don't understand Chinese medicine,' he says. 'People who
understand appreciate it. Western medicine is based on analysis and work in
laboratories. Chinese medicine depends on practice and experimentation.'
Some may describe Mr Zhao as a 'quack' - a term that seems genuinely to hurt
him. But he certainly is laughing all the way to the bank. He expects to
produce about 3m containers of Formula 101 this year, 40 per cent of which
will be exported. Profits should exceed Pounds 4.5m.
Joint ventures with foreign businessmen are in the wind, and the American
Food and Drug Administration is evaluating his product. FDA approval would
add enormous value to Formula 101, which is being imported into the US as a
cosmetic, not a drug. Not bad for someone who might have spent his life
copying figures into a dusty ledger.
Mr Zhao's chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up outside an arched shop front on
Beijing's busy Xidan street, one of its main shopping thoroughfares. It is
one of his clinics and white-coated female attendants are clearing up for
the day, but one 'patient' remains to be seen. For a balding worker visiting
Beijing from a provincial town, this is his lucky day. Mr Fan is about to be
treated by the master.
Mr Zhao dons a white coat and begins massaging his Formula 101 into Mr Fan's
scalp. A treatment costs about Pounds 9 - equivalent to a week's wages for
the average worker - but Mr Fan says this is a small price to pay. 'I've
been going bald for seven years and look older than I am,' he says. 'I heard
that 101 was magical. Everybody's talking about beauty now ' beautifying
life. People are paying more attention to appearance.'
Mr Zhao, who employs 1,200 people at factories and clinics throughout China,
exhibits no reserve about his good fortune although he is careful to credit
China's communist leadership, past and present, with creating conditions for
people like him to prosper. He reveals, for example, that long ago he
re-purchased the old family house in Wenzhou. And he announces, proudly,
that he has built a 1,000 square metre mansion near his home town for his
retirement. He keeps a penthouse flat in Beijing in one of the city's more
exclusive addresses, and is planning to buy a newer Mercedes. 'This car's
quite old,' he says, apologetically.
If Mr Zhao's story is remarkable, so also is the story of Qiaotou, a small
town about an hour's drive inland from Wenzhou. There, entrepreneur traders
and manufacturers have virtually cornered China's button market, and also
are producing a fairly big percentage of the country's metal watch bands.
Tang Runong, a local party official, describes Qiaotou (population 60,000)
as the 'paradigm of a socialist market economy' with annual revenues of
around Pounds 35m. The per capita income works out at around four times the
national average, although the many stern signs around the town warning
against tax evasion suggest that material success has not made people any
more willing to share their spoils with the state. 'You won't find this
small town on the map of China, but everybody has heard about us,' he says,
with satisfaction. Before the open-door policy, the town had one small inn
and one restaurant: now, it boasts 60 restaurants and 60 hotels.
Just how Qiaotou achieved its great leap to prosperity is the stuff of
legend. According to local lore, some impoverished peasant farmers were
visiting Nanjing, on the Yangtze, where they discovered a batch of imperfect
buttons discarded on a rubbish tip. They carried the buttons back to Qiaotou
and found, to their delight, that they were tradeable items. So began a
business in one of life's most basic commodities that has led to Qiaotou
itself making half of China's buttons as well as being the wholesaling
centre for about 80 per cent of the country's requirements.
With China's garment-producing industry growing very rapidly, Qiaotou's
future seems assured. Along the way, a fairly significant number of people
there have become rich beyond their wildest dreams.
Xian Guo Xing, the watch band 'king' of Qiaotou, has a problem: he cannot
fit a lift in his six-storey house to transport him to his various floors.
These boast a bar stocked with cognac, a 27-inch colour television, a roof
garden with commanding views, and a personalised Karaoke bar with its
oversized loudspeakers. By any standards, Xian has made it.
He has a simple solution for his lift problem - he is giving the house to
his son and daughters and moving down the road to a larger, new dwelling -
complete with an elevator. All this is not bad for someone who was labouring
in the fields as a peasant until seven years ago.
But while Xian is happy to admit that things have moved fast for him, he
insists that others have got rich more quickly and have bigger houses with
lifts. Indeed, a lift appears to be the ultimate status symbol in Qiaotou.
'Look over there,' he says, gesturing from his roof garden. 'There is a much
bigger house than mine - with a lift in it.'
Madam Jiang, Xian's talkative wife, still cannot quite believe their good
fortune. She recalls that when they were married in 1957, they lived without
running water and had to burn straw in their stove for heating and cooking.
They owned neither radio nor sewing machine and she carried water from the
river in buckets. Now, their house has three kitchens and three bathrooms,
two washing machines, four colour television sets (hooked up to a cable
service), a microwave, and other labor-saving devices she did not know
existed when she married.
'We lived on sweet potatoes,' she says. 'I never expected this. My biggest
wish was simply to live a better life. The difference between then and now
is like heaven and earth.'
Xian has a fairly crude philosophy about making money and the widening gap
between rich and poor. 'You can't make everyone equal,' he says. 'Equality
cannot develop the country. You have to have someone who gets rich first.
'If the boss gets rich, everyone from the village gets rich with him.'
At a nearby factory, Mr Zhang, one of Qiaotou's 'button kings,' would agree.
Business is tough, he says, noting that he works more than 10 hours a day,
seven days a week. 'Wealth never simply drops down from heaven into your
pocket,' he adds.
Back at the Qiaotou button market itself, a series of large structures on
the main street, buyers and wholesalers haggle over prices and quality. But
all seem to have one idea: to make money. Typical is young Miss Jin Jian
Feng, who presides over mounds of buttons made by her family. She aims to
travel widely. She also wants a car. What sort? 'A big car - and an imported
one,' she says, emphatically.

FT  12 JUN 93 / The Long View: Evidence of duplicity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO NOW we know for sure what we have long suspected. Norman Lamont, while
chancellor of the exchequer, was pursuing a policy of pegging sterling
within the European exchange rate mechanism despite grave personal
misgivings about what was one of his predecessor John Major's leftover
policies. While telling the country there was not a scintilla of doubt about
the government's ERM commitment, he was privately urging the prime minister
to suspend membership. He was also, like Nigel Lawson before him, secretly
recommending that the Bank of England should be given independent
responsibility for setting interest rates.
Where does all this evidence of duplicity and strategic disagreement leave
the British government's credibility? There is, for instance, a commitment
to hold inflation below 4 per cent, and a pledge to cut back the public
sector borrowing requirement from its current year level of Pounds 50bn. It
is not entirely clear whether these promises left over from his predecessor
are worth the paper that Kenneth Clarke has not yet written them on. This
week Clarke was breezily discussing the choice between raising taxation and
cutting public spending (he will do neither, apparently) but the most
important question is whether he will opt for the unspoken third option, to
inflate his way out of trouble.
The financial markets have stayed surprisingly calm during the turmoil in
the top ranks of the British government. The sterling long bond yield has
actually eased a little but remains close to 8 1/2 per cent, striking an
awkward compromise between the 5 or 6 per cent which might be compatible
with long-run low inflation and financial stability, and a double-digit
return which would be required should the rate of destruction of the value
of the currency edge up again to erode the public sector's debt burden.
Yet, politicians must not be valued at their own estimate of their
decision-taking ability. The reassuring thought for those who rely on the
British government's readiness to honour its debts in real terms is that, in
a world of freely exchangeable currencies, the scope for deviant policies is
limited. The decision in 1990 to enter the ERM at the wrong rate, for
instance, could not be sustained for long. A dash for inflationary growth
would, similarly, lead to a market breakdown quite quickly.
But what one government cannot do on its own, a number of countries might
achieve collectively. This thought might be behind the recent nervous
flutter in the gold bullion market and the surge of strength in the one
leading currency - the Japanese yen - which is not burdened by the
structural deficits which plague the dollar, the D-mark and the pound
sterling, among others. The yen has appreciated by 54 per cent against
sterling since last August.
Just as the ERM proved a disappointment as a pre-packaged answer to the UK's
economic problems, it is pretty certain that central bank independence would
be a blind alley, too. The idea is that the central bank would cancel out
the feckless tendency of vote-catching politicians to inflate rather than to
tax. Unfortunately, the division of responsibility can also lead to a
protracted domestic economic war in which fiscal laxity is offset by
excessive monetary tightness. This became apparent in the US early in the
1980s, leading to a large over-valuation of the dollar. The same problem has
afflicted Germany.
It could easily happen in the UK, too, should the economic recovery pick up
speed. It would be nice to think that British chancellors hanker after an
independent Bank of England because they believe such an institution would
improve economic governance in the UK. More likely, they see a chance to
offload the blame for interest rate rises on somebody else. The idea seems
to appeal more to chancellors than to prime ministers, who would bear
overall responsibility for a policy mess.
The clash between bankers and spenders leads to high real interest rates,
which cancel out the stimulus which budget deficits might otherwise provide.
Meanwhile, finance ministries in many countries, especially the US and the
UK, are badly missing that important lubricant, inflation. The largely
unanticipated fall in inflation means that tax revenues are coming in under
budget, aggravating the deficit problems. In depressed conditions,
short-term interest rates can come down (except, so far, in Germany) but
long-term rates cannot, because such a vast volume of debt has to be sold.
If the combination of debt deflation in the US and elsewhere and
post-unification disruption in Germany continue to inhibit global economic
recovery, it seems likely that a sharp fall in real interest rates must
ensue, as part of the resolution of the crisis. How large a part inflation
might play in that is, for investors at least, the crucial question. The
first part of the political response is already becoming evident, as
governments shrink from financing themselves with long-term debt: the US,
for instance, has reduced the frequency of its 30-year bond auctions. There
will be an increasing resort to short-term finance through the banking
system. This will not prove to be inflationary so long as private sector
credit demand remains depressed, but this tempting solution contains the
seeds of trouble.
It is not a path the British government would be able to pursue on its own,
but it will follow eagerly in the footsteps of the Americans. The Germans,
meanwhile, will go their own way if they can, as they did in the
inflationary 1970s when the D-mark appreciated by 114 per cent against the
dollar and 130 per cent against sterling; but as the German economy spirals
downwards, the pressure on the Bundesbank may become intolerable.
As Norman Lamont said ruefully this week, both the post-war Tory chancellors
to have brought inflation below 2 per cent have been sacked. Clarke is
unlikely to make the same mistake.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Major prepared to send Bosnia reinforcements: PM backs
soldiers who shot dead Croat gunmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER, Mr John Major, yesterday strongly backed British
soldiers who fired on Croat gunmen in central Bosnia, saying he was prepared
to send reinforcements if necessary.
He was speaking a few hours after British United Nations peacekeeping troops
shot dead two Croatian soldiers who attacked a Moslem convoy near Vitez, the
British base in central Bosnia.
He underlined the government's commitment not to take 'any unacceptable
risks with the lives of our troops in Bosnia', telling a Conservative party
conference in Wales that there was 'increasing evidence of widespread
deterioration on the ground'.
The prime minister's office emphasised that Mr Major and other senior
ministers were keeping a close watch on the situation and said there were
contingency arrangements to protect the lives of the 2,400 British troops
deployed to assist in providing humanitarian aid in Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, indicated that the incident would
not lead to an early withdrawal of the British contingent of UN forces from
Bosnia. 'So long as the government believes that our troops can do a good
job in saving lives without undue risk, they will go on doing so,' he said.
In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned that intense
fighting and roadblocks have virtually halted all humanitarian aid convoys
in central Bosnia.
'We have basically reached a worst-case scenario with things degenerating,'
Mr Ron Redmond, UNHCR spokesman, said.
In Belgrade, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, mediators for the EC and
the UN, announced that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, President
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia had
agreed to travel to Geneva for peace talks, probably next Wednesday. The
Bosnian Croat leader, Mate Boban, reversing a previous statement, said he
too would go to Geneva.
Lord Owen said: 'We have to look increasingly at the issue of Bosnia and
Croatia and Serbia and that is why I think it is appropriate we have the
three presidents talking to each other.'
Mr Major is under pressure from opposition MPs who have urged the withdrawal
of British soldiers. MPs of all parties expressed dismay at the
fast-deteriorating situation in Bosnia.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the situation could not
be controlled.
The Bosnian Serb army said it would hand back weapons to up to 900 Croats
who surrendered to them so they can go back to fighting Moslems in central
Bosnia. The Croats had been held in a prison camp after being taken from a
flood of refugees who fled clashes with Moslems around Travnik during the
weekend.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Defence ministry probes ICL deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the Japanese-owned UK computer company, is under investigation by the
Ministry of Defence for suspected irregularities involving two contracts
totalling Pounds 1m.
MoD police on Thursday morning visited ICL's sales office at Slough and
engineering offices at Stevenage and Basingstoke, all in south-east England,
and took away documents relating to the contracts.
ICL said last night the contracts had been for 'run-of-the-mill' work
installing computers and cabling for the MoD. An MoD spokesman said last
night: 'An investigation is taking place, but I cannot discuss it further
until the outcome is known.' Mr Richard Livesey-Hawarth, an ICL executive
director, said: 'We take the matter very seriously, and will do what we can
to co-operate.'
He was constrained from commenting further by official undertakings, but
added: 'I would not be surprised if the MoD had been contacted by a
disgruntled former employee, who might want to bring us into disrepute.'
ICL has been the preferred supplier of mainframe computers to the MoD since
the 1960s.
It is the prime contractor on a Pounds 250m office automation project for
the MoD. The contract was awarded two years ago.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Payouts to terrorists no longer qualify for tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIBES or protection money paid to terrorists would no longer be tax
deductible under draft rules announced by the government yesterday.
Purchasers of stolen goods or importers of illegal drugs could also no
longer expect Inland Revenue inspectors to offset their business expenses
against their tax bill.
Payments which themselves constitute the commission of a criminal offence
would not be subsidised by the taxpayer, according to a proposed amendment
to the finance bill put forward by the chief secretary to the Treasury.
These include offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (such as
bribes) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (which deals with the payment of
protection money).
At present, any expenses incurred 'wholly, necessarily and exclusively' for
the purposes of a trade can in principle qualify for relief.
The Inland Revenue, however, conceded yesterday that it had no qualms about
accepting tax from shady enterprises. It said: 'Legality has not strictly
been a deciding factor.
'We hope we have not been aiding and abetting these activities but it is
possible that some have in the past been regarded as part of a lump sum
figure of necessary expenditure.'
Just this point was at issue in a High Court court action three years ago by
Ms Lindi St Claire, who argued that the Inland Revenue would be living off
immoral earnings if it taxed her income as a prostitute and brothel-keeper.
She lost.
Asked whether any equipment required by brothels would be allowable against
tax, the Inland Revenue said: 'I don't think we've looked at it on that wide
a scale.'
One compensation remains for those involved in illicit activities who are
honest enough to admit it to the tax authorities. The Inland Revenue
stressed that it was bound by confidentiality and could not disclose to the
police any details of illegal activities it unearthed.

Minority shareholders in The Telegraph may still be smarting over the
handling of the company's investment in Southam but they should have less
complaint with Mr Conrad Black's diversification into Australia. Following
the Australian government's loosening of restrictions on foreign ownership,
The Telegraph has spent Pounds 23m increasing its stake in the John Fairfax
group of newspapers from 15.3 per cent to 18 per cent with an option to buy
some more.
Having been laid low by poor management in the 1980s, Fairfax has staged a
spirited recovery under new ownership. Its shares have climbed to ADollars
2.31 from ADollars 1.38 since their flotation in April 1992 as the group's
profitability has revived. At the time of The Telegraph's own flotation,
investors grumbled about the low dividend yield given the maturity of the
business and its declining customer base. Yet the Fairfax investment may
reveal there is greater growth potential than had previously been assumed.
Mr Black's idiosyncratic management style can have its bonuses too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US unchanged producer prices index was greeted by some like the
relief of Mafeking. The worsening inflation picture had increased
speculation that the Federal Reserve was about to raise interest rates. Yet
the much-improved figures also hinted at more good news to come. A spike in
food prices has yet to be unwound and tobacco prices actually rose during
May, against the trend of the cigarette brand wars. The immediate threat of
higher rates has thus receded.
Nevertheless, increased interest rates later in the year are still a
possibility, with hints from the Fed suggesting that consumer price
inflation remains too high. The Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, is due to
give his regular testimony to Congress next month. If he lays less emphasis
on the health of the financial system and more on inflation, that will
probably mark an ending of the Fed's easy money policy.
An autumn interest rate increase would, however, coincide with the impact of
President Clinton's budget package. That will probably prove quite
deflationary, and the risk is that both fiscal and monetary policy will be
tightened simultaneously. Growth may thus slow in 1994. While inflation is
not low enough to please the Fed, tough conditions may prevent companies
widening margins. That will make the strong earnings increases which Wall
Street currently expects harder to achieve. Equities are still vulnerable.

FT  12 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: English China Clays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years, English China Clays has developed a reputation for doing
the right thing without ever really delivering the right result. Its latest
significant shift in acquiring a US speciality chemicals business for Pounds
202m and pressing ahead with the demerger of its construction materials
division may do little to alter that impression.
The addition of Calgon undoubtedly makes strategic sense. It broadens ECC's
product base while giving Calgon greater access to European markets. But an
exit multiple of 24 represents a full price, even though ECC promises the
deal will be earnings neutral in its first full year. Thereafter, it may
prove tough work squeezing margins higher: Calgon only commands the weak
third slot in the US market.
The demerger proposal also makes industrial sense but it is not clear that
it will create additional shareholder value. Applying a market multiple to
ECC's two divisions individually produces a value somewhat shy of its
current share price. Moreover, ECC's markets remain dire with paper makers,
in particular, bracing themselves for sharp declines in German demand.
The other niggle about Calgon is its financing. ECC's new shares, yielding
more than 7 per cent, represent an expensive means of raising money.
Borrowing dollars from the bank would have been cheaper, although this would
have pushed up gearing from 24 per cent to 69 per cent. Lower debt will
doubtless make life easier when the demerger proceeds. But shareholders may
reflect on the last time ECC tapped them for cash in February 1992. Those
who subscribed for new shares at 415p had seen them rise by just 1p by
Thursday's close.

FT  12 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Banking on rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another Pounds 350m worth of rights issues this week suggests the flow may
be getting out of hand. It is understandable that companies should be
anxious to secure their money before BT monopolises the market, less so that
they should be so concerned with raising equity at this stage in the cycle.
If they really are gearing up for recovery, it would be more appropriate to
go for debt. That is most clearly arguable in the case of Wimpey, but true
of some of this week's other offerings as well. Yet while the equity market
is awash with business, the well of bank credit is almost dry.
Part of the trouble is that corporate balance sheets are still showing the
ravages of recession. Some bank debt is also being replaced by the heavy
flow of corporate bond issues. But there remains a worry that the banks are
not yet willing to finance the recovery. Unless they change their minds, it
could eventually falter. The capital market cannot stand the strain
indefinitely, especially given the remorseless tide of gilts.
That is not the only preoccupation, however. Yesterday brought the first
figures on trade with Europe since January, while in the background the
political uncertainty grows. The trade figures show exporters are using the
devaluation to increase their margins rather than gain market share, which
is good for profits in the short run but may be bad for growth in the longer
term. Mr Norman Lamont's attack on the prime minister may have been dramatic
but its implication for the market is hard to gauge.
Mr Major's classic response to trouble is to cut interest rates - and the
strictures from Mr Eddie George this week suggest the Bank of England may
fear just such a development. Mr Kenneth Clarke professes concern about
growth and employment, but this could be just a front behind which to engage
in some radical pruning of the PSBR. There is plenty of room for internal
debate on strategy. The markets can only hope to know more after next week's
Mansion House speech.

FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides after inflation
data gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER POSTING big early gains on promising inflation news, US share prices
fell back amid growing concern about the outlook for the economy, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.29 at 3,505.01,
some 10 points off its session peak. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's
500 ended 1.63 higher at 447.01, while the Amex composite finished down 1.40
at 434.32, and the Nasdaq composite up 5.14 at 693.19. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 255m shares.
The release of the May producer prices index brought relief to those in the
markets worried that rising inflation would force the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates. The PPI came in flat last month, and the 'core'
measure (excluding the volatile food and energy components) was up by only
0.2 per cent.
The figures will relieve the pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy
as a precautionary measure against inflation. They lifted both stock and
bond prices. The Dow gained 25 points in the opening 30 minutes, while the
benchmark 30-year government bond rose three quarters of a point, lowering
the yield to 6.81 per cent.
The gains, however, were not sustained. The bad news about yesterday's data
was that the low inflation figures confirmed that the economy is currently
too weak to support the price increases that were seen at the start of the
year. The release yesterday of a disappointing May retail sales report -
sales rose by only 0.1 per cent last month - was further evidence that
domestic demand remains subdued.
As a result share prices eased off their early highs, although bond prices
remained firm, and the 30-year yield fell further to under 6.8 per cent. The
jury is still not out on inflation, however, because the May consumer prices
figures have yet to be released. They are due on Tuesday.
Bank stocks were helped by the reduced threat of a rise in interest rates.
BankAmerica added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 , Banc One rose Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 , Chemical put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 38 1/2 ,
Citicorp firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27 1/2 , and Wells Fargo climbed
Dollars 4 to Dollars 103.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which fell sharply on Thursday following a
profits warning from the company's management, rebounded, gaining Dollars 2
7/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 .
Affiliated Publications, which owns the Boston Globe, rose Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of 1.3m shares after the New York Times confirmed
that it plans to buy Affiliated for Dollars 1.1bn in cash and stock. On the
American Stock Exchange, New York Times shares fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
24 3/8 in busy trading.
Canada
TORONTO prices ended mixed in moderate trading. According to preliminary
figures, the TSE-300 composite index fell 8.95 points, or 0.23 per cent, to
end at 3,866.49. Over the week,the index lost about 28 points.
Winning issues led losers by 368 to 317, volume of 57.28m shares compared
with 59.65m and trading value was CDollars 559.8m compared with CDollars
598.4m.
Gold shares fell 2.15 per cent on index.

BUYING prompted by hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate
countered heavy arbitrage-linked selling, and the Nikkei average posted
marginal gains towards the close, rising for the first time in five trading
days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
After a volatile morning session due to the fixing of the settlement price
for June options and futures contracts, the Nikkei rose 7.63 to 20,500.95,
1.8 per cent lower on the week. The index rose to a day's high of 20,760.06
early afternoon and hit the day's low of 20,451.56 in the last half hour of
trading.
Volume totaled 650m shares against 277m, with an estimated 300m shares
linked to futures and options settlements in the first hour of trading.
Winners led losers by 580 to 409 with 189 unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks rallied 8.78 to 1,661.04 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 1.04 to 1,249.87.
The Bank of Japan's Tankan, the quarterly survey of business sentiment
released yesterday, indicated that confidence among corporations was
unchanged from three months earlier. The bond market ended higher, as
renewed hopes of a cut in the official discount rate emerged.
Public pension funds and insurers were seen buying large-capital issues on
hopes of lower interest rates. Kawasaki Heavy Industries rose Y5 to Y474 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y3 to Y706.
Stainless steel makers were firmer on reports of an increase in stainless
steel orders. Nippon Yakin rose Y2 to Y631 and Nippon Metal gained Y4 to
Y520.
Banks were firmer on technical trading. Foreign fund managers, who are
relatively underweight in banks, are also looking to increase holdings.
Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y30 to Y3,030 and Bank of Tokyo gained Y10
to Y1,470.
Car makers were lower on concerns of poor earnings. Nissan Motor lost Y8 to
Y737 and Honda Motor declined Y40 to Y1,360.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 79.54 to 23,086.45 in volume of 19.9m shares.
Roundup
THERE was selective interest in the region yesterday. Karachi was closed for
a religious holiday.
KUALA LUMPUR reached a new all time high in sentiment boosted by the visit
of Mr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, to China starting this
Sunday which is expected to yield lucrative business deals for local
companies.
The KLSE index rose 8.76 to 746.29, 1.9 per cent higher on the week as
volume rose from 495.2m shares to 635.9m.
BANGKOK extended its June recovery with the SET index climbing 9.13 to
853.14, 2.5 per cent higher on the week in turnover of Bt4.5bn. Property
developers rose strongly, with Bangkok Land up Bt5 to Bt81.50, Tanayong
Bt2.50 to Bt65.50 and Krisda Mahanakorn Bt6 to Bt117.
HONG KONG saw light bargain hunting in thin volume, and the Hang Seng index
inched up 6.16 to 7,266.74, 1.5 per cent higher on the week, as turnover
shrank from HKDollars 3.94bn to HKDollars 3.78bn. SINGAPORE's Straits Times
Industrial index fell on thin selling pressure, 11.60 to 1,853.05 and 1 per
cent down on the week.
SEOUL faced profit-taking after a succession of 31-month highs. The
composite index lost 4.91 to 768.48, still 1.1 per cent better on the week,
as turnover dropped to Won 884.9bn.
AUSTRALIA celebrated a bullion recovery in Hong Kong, and the gold shares
index closed 17.9 higher at 1,709.7, 8.4 per cent lower on the week, after
an initial fall of more than 25 points.
The All Ordinaries index rose 1.8 to 1,714.3, down 1.5 per cent on the week.
Pacific Dunlop rose 6 cents to ADollars 4.83 on Thursday's news that it had

FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Comment turns bearish after a
good week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES, according to the Eurotrack 100, registered a good rise on the week.
But analysts and strategists, meanwhile, were pushing them into the
underweight basket, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN closed the week where it had begun with a further fall in Ferruzzi,
down L73 or 9 per cent at L732. This followed news that the group had handed
executive powers to the group of creditor banks headed by Mediobanca.
As a result the banking sector also dived, with Mediobanca losing L310 to
L16,270 at the close before slipping to L15,900 on the kerb. Among the other
creditor banks, BCI lost L274 to L5,242 and Credito Italiano L105 to L2,693.
There were fears, said some analysts, that should a debt-for-equity swap
proceed in relation to Ferruzzi, similar arrangements might be negotiated
for other debt-laden groups.
Montedison eased L5 to L975 at the close before sliding to L890 in after
hours trading. However, Edison, seen as one of the remaining jewels in the
Ferruzzi empire, remained steady, easing just L3 to L5,010.
The Comit index slipped 1.35 to 531.89, little changed on the week.
PARIS was supported towards the close by a stronger Wall Street. The CAC-40
index gained 9.21 to 1,920.43, up 3.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was a
moderate FFr2.5bn.
Most analysts were expecting a rate cut on Monday given the recent strength
of the franc against the D - Mark.
Among the day's movers, LVMH corrected Thursday's fall following its annual
meeting, picking up FFr22 to FFr3,705 while, in the financial sector, UAP
gained FFr22 to FFr3,705, and Suez FFr2 to FFr299 in high volume.
Eridania Beghin-Say, the sugar, agro-industrial and branded foods company
controlled by Ferruzzi, rallied FFr8 to FFr691, down 3.6 per cent on a week
affected by the problems at its Italian parent.
FRANKFURT returned from holiday, and raised suspicions of window dressing
ahead of the June 30 valuations. The DAX index climbed another 7.91 to
1,680.98, up 2.6 per cent on the week and just a few points short of its
March 31 level. Turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.8bn.
Carmakers had another good day, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen rising by DM9 to
DM473, DM8 to DM587.50, and DM4.30 to DM340.80 respectively, leaving
analysts with their eyebrows raised. In Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm of
Merck Finck said that the bank was a seller of Daimler and VW, and that
earnings per share here were going to be lower than the optimists were
expecting.
In London, Mr Bob Barber and Mr James Longhurst of James Capel looked at
European car sales, reduced their forecasts and said that share prices had
held up 'amazingly' well this year, concluding: 'The automotive sector has
only underperformed the JC European index by 2 per cent in the year to date,
and we predict a major downward correction in share prices late this year.'
MADRID closed a week of nervous, then muted reaction to the Socialist
election victory with a fall of 1.3 per cent, the general index closing 0.36
higher on the day at 257.91.
In London, Ms Anna MacDonald and Mr Victor Galliano of Baring Securities
said that it was time to sell the Spanish market. It has been a good
performer so far this year, but the Socialist win made aggressively lower
interest rates and widespread privatisation less likely. 'Investors looking
to buy for a recovery,' they said, 'will do better elsewhere.'
AMSTERDAM featured a 5 per cent gain in Hoogovens, partly on hopes for a
recovery in the sector, and partly on a stronger aluminium price. The shares
gained FL 1.50 to Fl 32.10 as the CBS Tendency index lost 0.2 to 107.1, a
week's rise of 2.3 per cent.
ING, which disappointed the market on Thursday with flat first quarter
figures, recovered 70 cents to Fl 63.60.
VIENNA rose 2.7 per cent, the ATX index closing 12.43, or 1.5 per cent up on
the day at 837.73.
ISTANBUL advanced to another record high supported by political optimism and
good half year company results. The index rose 148.35 to 8,835.51 for a
week's gain of 5.5 per cent.
THE FT-SE EUROTRACK INDICES COMMITTEE has agreed to make the following
changes to the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index Constituent list:
Additions: Tractebel (Belgium); GBL (Belgium); Argentaria (Spain);
Volkswagen Reg. (Germany).
Deletions: Investor B (Sweden); Union Electrica Fenosa (Spain); Investor A

The indicative reserve list now comprises: SMH Reg. (Switzerland); Olivetti

All the above changes will take effect from June 21 1993.

FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Stronger yen casts its shadow over
equities - Market activity in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The summer months, historically, have been unkind to the Tokyo stock market.
After the jump in activity during recent months, shares are currently facing
a lull, on uncertainty over a higher yen and on caution regarding the course
of the economy.
The Nikkei index rose 24 per cent during the first four months of this year,
but it has remained almost flat around 20,500 during the past month. The
21,000 line has proven to be a tough one to crack, as investors who bought
around that level in 1991 wait to unload their holdings.
There are now signs that US hedge funds, looking for quick profits, are
anticipating a chance to sell into weakness, creating short positions in the
near term.
Last month's corporate results season held few surprises, with pre-tax
profits for leading companies down by some 30 per cent. Estimates for
pre-tax profits for the current year to March 1994 are mixed, ranging from a
rise of 14 per cent to a fall of 10 per cent.
The rise in the equity market over the past few months, seems to indicate
that investors have discounted corporate profits for the fiscal year to
March 1995. Mr Patrick Thompson, at Fleming Investment Management, believes
that corporate profits could rise by 70 to 100 per cent for that year.
With the market on a prospective p/e of 78 times, however, many investors
have started to feel uncomfortable over current valuations. They are not
willing to increase holdings further until there is a fall in share prices
or firm evidence of an improvement in the economy. Japanese institutional
investors, who have been inactive during the recent rally, may not come in
until they confirm the market's uptrend.
The sudden rise in the yen against the dollar threatens companies'
projections of flat profits for the current year to March 1994. The rise
also comes at a time when a spate of statistics is casting doubts on
previous optimism over an imminent bottoming out of the economy.
Bank lending for April rose by 1.1 per cent from the previous year, its
smallest rise ever, while industrial output for April fell 2.2 per cent from
the month before after two consecutive months of strong gains.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out
that the stronger yen could depress the Nikkei below the 20,000 level. 'The
contradiction of the yen gaining as a result of the stable stock market, and
in turn threatening economic recovery, will be tested,' he says.
While denied by the US, the yen's rise reflects the perception among
investors that currency market movements will be used to pressure Japan.
Analysts point out that a strong yen will not achieve a fall in Japan's
trade surplus. Some believe that unless a policy to solve bilateral trade
issues is formulated between the US and Japan, the dollar could fall to as
low as Y100.
A higher yen is good news for inflation. It also means lower import prices.
However, benefits for the consumer are expected to be offset by corporate
rationalisation. Leading companies have announced an average decline of 1.86
per cent for this year's summer bonuses, the first fall since 1987.
In short, rather than enriching the ordinary Japanese, and triggering a
return in consumer confidence through lower imports, a higher yen will hurt
consumption as companies will feel squeeze on income.
Meanwhile, the recent stability of prices has given authorities room to
address the market's structural problems.
A recent report commissioned by the finance ministry identifies cross
shareholdings between companies as a barrier to an efficient market.
On the over-the-counter market, disclosure problems of small companies have
once again made investors nervous. At the beginning of this month, Hanix
Industry, a construction machinery manufacturer, announced that it had filed
for court protection, with liabilities totalling Y170bn.
The company blamed 'malicious credit reports' and allegations of tax evasion
for itsfunding problems. While the incident reflected the vulnerability of
small companies to rumours, it also cast doubts on the lack of disclosure by
OTC corporations.
Earlier this week rumours that THK, a leading bearings company, was facing
financial problems once again rocked the OTC market. The Japan Securities
Dealers Association is now to study disclosure measures for OTC companies.
In the near term, the 21,000 level continues to be a barrier for the Nikkei.
Japanese investors expect resistance at that level to persist, and remain
conservative in their forecasts. Mr Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at
Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, expects the index to fluctuate
between 18,000 and 22,000 until the autumn.
Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson is more optimistic. He sees the Nikkei
falling to 18,500 in the worst case scenario, but thinks that the next few
months will be a trough before a 'powerful drive upwards", predicting that
it will reach 24,000 by the end of the year.

FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC at peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent buying of GEC, the UK's flagship electronics group, gathered momentum
yesterday, driving the share price up to a record 338p. Just before the
close of trading they came off the top to end a net 4 1/2 up at 337 1/2 p.
Turnover was a good 6.9m shares.
A hefty buying order, reportedly from a single large US institution, was
driving the stock higher yesterday. Electronics specialists said GEC was one
of only a handful of top quality UK stocks, mostly among the utilities,
offering above-average dividend growth and a strong balance sheet.
GEC is scheduled to announce preliminary results on June 30, and analysts
expect profits in the region of Pounds 870m, up more than 5 per cent and a 7
per cent increase in the dividend total.

FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurer sells Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES that Zeneca's Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, which closes on June 21,
could yet run into more turbulence were heightened yesterday when the mighty
Prudential insurance group revealed it had reduced its stake in the
recently-demerged bioscience arm of ICI to below 3 per cent.
Marketmakers were poised to shift their quotations as the news spread
through the dealing rooms but very little selling pressure in fact ensued.
Zeneca 'old' shares, which dipped to 614p before the Prudential news was
known, eventually closed a fraction easier at 616p on turnover of 4.5m. The
'new' nil-paid shares, in which the Pru was said to have carried out most of
the selling, eased 2 to 18p, after 17p, with 6.5m shares changing hands. It
later emerged that the Pru had sold less than one per cent of Zeneca stock,
or some 5.8m shares.
Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief executive of Prudential Portfolio Managers, said
'Some of the investment funds managed by the Prudential have been
rebalancing their portfolios in the health and household sector. This has
resulted in a reduction of their Zeneca nil-paid rights. However the
Prudential will be taking up the majority of its rights and is supportive of
the issue.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities unable to maintain advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNCERTAIN session in the UK stock market ended on a sour note yesterday
when rumours of an impending political scandal checked London's response to
the strong opening on Wall Street which had followed good news on US retail
sales and producer prices.
Earlier, the stock market rallied from a loss of 10.8 on the FT-SE Index,
helped by a firm opening by stock index futures. Later, equities continued
to steady as sterling responded favourably to satisfactory UK trade figures
for the first quarter of the year, which showed a smaller than expected
visible deficit on trade with the EC.
But trading volume was moderate and London was still waiting with some
caution for the important economic data on the US economy to be announced in
Washington.
The largely unchanged US producer price index, backed up by a comment from
the US Commerce Secretary that increases in US interest rates were now not
needed, sent Wall Street ahead by 11 Dow points in London hours. The Footsie
tried to move upwards but failed to hold its best levels.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was only 1.8 up at 2,861.8 and traders were
asking themselves whether the market had enough strength to test the higher
end of its trading range at around 2,880. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index eased by
4.8 to 3,202.9. Seaq volume fell to 528.8m shares from Thursday's 620.3m,
which was worth Pounds 1.35bn in retail worth.
Suggestions that a UK newspaper will next week publish a story of political
corruption surfaced early in the stock market trading session and were
greeted with some scepticism in a market not unaccustomed to Friday
afternoon rumour-mongering.
This week has seen a recovery of 31.9 points in the Footsie, largely on
hopes that the new UK chancellor of the exchequer may sanction a cut in base
rates, perhaps on Tuesday when he delivers his Mansion House speech to the
City of London. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index has advanced to new peaks, closing
last night nearly 1 per cent higher on the week.
Government bonds moved narrowly yesterday, cautiously watching sterling's
performance. At the close, longer dated bonds were a shade easier while
Index-linked issues, the market's inflation hedge instruments, edged higher.
The UK authorities announced the issue of a further Pounds 700m of its 8.75
per cent bond dated 2017.

<TEXT>
BETTER than expected US producer price index figures enlivened an otherwise
dull Footsie futures market though further gains were checked by talk of a
political scandal, writes Joel Kibazo.
A general lack of buying interest as dealers continued to reflect on the UK
political scene characterised the morning session. Having opened at 2,854,
the June contract on the FTSE dipped to 2,852 and hovered around that level
for the next few hours.
The release of the US figures over the lunch hour prised buyers from the
sidelines sending the June contract to the day's high of 2,873. However the
buying ran out of steam as the market neared its official close as talk of
an impending political scandal circulated. June closed at 2,865.
Total turnover in the traded options remained low at 26,314. Activity in the
FT-SE 100 option remained poor reaching 6,518 contracts and the Euro FT-SE
2,521 lots. Shell was the most active stock option with a total of 2,403
lots dealt.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar down on inflation data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after May's
producer prices figures in the US showed that the rate of inflation was far
smaller than had been anticipated, writes James Blitz.
Last month's producer price index showed a month-on-month rise of 0.6 per
cent, raising strong speculation that the Federal Reserve would tighten
interest rates later this year.
However, the May figure showed producer price inflation unchanged, with the
ex-food and energy figure up 0.2 per cent.
As if this were not enough to dash thoughts of an interest rate rise, the
May retail sales figures also underlined that the US does not need policy
tightening at the moment. Retail sales rose 0.1 per cent on the month, with
the ex-autos figure unchanged. This compared with a much higher market
expectation of a 1.0 per cent rise in the figure.
Before the figures were released, the dollar was bid as high as DM1.6335.
But it quickly dropped back to bottom out at DM1.6180, closing in London at
DM1.6255.
The market will wait for next week's consumer price inflation figure before
giving its final verdict on US interest rate moves. Further confirmation
could also come from the Michigan consumer confidence survey for June, due
on Friday, which will show whether these inflation figures are a blip.
The dollar lost a little less ground against the Japanese yen, following the
onslaught it has received in recent days. Dealers awaited the outcome of
yesterday's trade talks between the US and Japan, at which the US was
expected to push for a reduction of Tokyo's trade surplus.
Unless these talks produce a startling result, the yen is likely to retrace
a little. But a focus for the market next week will be the Japanese trade
balance figures for May, which again should show a powerful surplus.
The yen closed at Y106.05 from a previous Y106.20.
In Europe, sterling was again a strong performer, amid a growing belief that
the UK will not reduce interest rates later this year. However, after
peaking at DM2.4960, the pound fell by two pfennigs in the late afternoon
amid rumours that a British newspaper will soon report a new scandal at the
heart of Mr John Major's government. The pound closed at DM2.4750, down  3/4
of a pfennig on the day.
Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism was quiet yesterday. But
most currencies have performed so well against the D-Mark in recent days,
that there were strong rumours last night that France, Spain and Denmark
could cut interest rates again next week.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Dollar rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in Eurodollar interest rate markets took the view that the Federal
Reserve would not lean towards tightening monetary policy after US producer
prices figures for May turned out to be lower than expected, writes James
Blitz.
The producer prices index showed that US factory gate prices were unchanged
on the month, compared to a 0.6 per cent rise in April. However, the market
will wait for next week's figures for consumer price inflation before making
its final judgement.
In recent weeks, there has been speculation that the Fed might lean towards
tightening monetary policy to combat inflation.
But the sluggishness of the US recovery ensures that this will probably not
be the case for some time yet.
In the Eurodollar cash market, 3-month offered rates dropped from 3 7/16 per
cent to 3 3/8 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract closed
7 basis points higher at 96.42.
At this level, it is assuming that 3-month money will be at 3.58 per cent in
the autumn.
Sterling markets were more-or-less unchanged yesterday, with dealers
continuing to take the view that another base rate cut was far less likely
following Mr Norman Lamont's attack on politically-inspired rate cuts this
week.
The September short sterling contract closed up 2 basis points on the day at
94.16, pricing 3-month money in the autumn at 5.84 per cent. In the cash
market, interest rates closed a little firmer at 5 15/16 per cent, despite
the small daily shortage of Pounds 400m forecast by the Bank of England. The
overnight rate of lending was seen as low as 4 1/2 per cent.
European markets were mostly unchanged after a week which saw a downward
revision of forecasts of German interest rate cuts. Three month D-Marks
closed at 7.57 per cent yesterday, while 3 month French francs closed at
around 7.25 per cent.
There is some speculation, however, that France and other European countries
might take the advantage of a weak D-Mark to ease monetary policy again next
week.
The French franc has performed well in recent days, staying mostly on the
strong side of FFr3.37 to the D-Mark. Spain could also reduce interest rates
for the first time after Mr Felipe Gonzalez's victory in the general
election.

SWISSAIR said yesterday a co-operation agreement linking it with KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines
could not be signed until September at the earliest, writes Ian Rodger in
Zurich.
The four were hoping to agree terms by the end of this month. In the longer
term, a full merger is envisioned.
Swissair insisted the delay did not reflect any disagreement or disaffection
among the partners. Rather, there were issues taking longer to resolve than
expected.
An important one was satisfying the demand of the Swiss federal government
that Swissair put forward alternative plans to ensure its independence. The
government holds a 7 per cent stake in the national airline.
Swissair, which has made clear its frustration with the government's order,
said it would probably be unable to prepare documentation and fix a meeting
with federal officials until after the summer holidays.
Meanwhile, Swissair's supervisory board, on which a senior federal
government official sits, said following a meeting this week it agreed with
the airline's management that it would be increasingly difficult to 'go it
alone'.

3bn merger

SHARES in Galen Health Care, a large operator of private US hospitals, rose
sharply yesterday following the announcement of a Dollars 3.2bn
share-exchange merger with Columbia Hospital Corporation. The deal will
create America's largest for-profit hospital chain.
The new company, to be called Columbia Healthcare Corporation, will operate
99 hospitals and have annual revenues of over Dollars 5bn.
Wall Street warmly welcomed the deal, which was announced after the market
closed on Thursday. It involves Galen investors receiving 0.775 shares in
the much smaller Columbia for each of the 160m shares of Galen outstanding.
Stock in Columbia rose yesterday morning on the Nasdaq over-the-counter
market to Dollars 26 1/4 at lunchtime, up Dollars  3/4 , while Galen rose
Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 .
Columbia, with 26 hospitals in the southern US, is a fast growing chain
which acquires groups of hospitals in a particular geographical area and
then consolidates them to lower costs and boost occupancy rates.
Galen, which is about three times Columbia's size, was spun off earlier this
year from Humana, a hospital and health insurance company.

four-way European link-up
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System was given the go-ahead yesterday by its Danish,
Norwegian and Swedish owners to negotiate an ambitious alliance with KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The link-up is aimed
at establishing a fourth force in the European airline market to compete
with British Airways, Air France and Germany's Lufthansa.
SAS said its board of directors had authorised negotiations after a review
of the airlines' outline plan by its parent companies and the three
Scandinavian governments.
Under a complex ownership structure, the three governments own 50 per cent
of SAS through their respective 50 per cent stakes in the three airline
companies which make up 100 per cent of the SAS shareholding. Private
shareholders have the remaining 50 per cent of the three airline companies.
SAS officials said the intention was still to produce a memorandum of
understanding with its three potential partners by the end of the summer,
despite signs of resistance to the integration plan, particularly in
Switzerland. The Swiss government has asked Swissair to produce an
alternative strategy for consideration which would preserve its
independence.
The four airlines announced in April they intended setting up a
jointly-owned company with a single management and balance sheet by next
year.
SAS, KLM and Swissair would each own 30 per cent of the new company, and
Austrian Airlines 10 per cent.
The plan envisages 'a profitable, global airline' with an integrated traffic
system based on a multi-hub European network, including Amsterdam,
Copenhagen, Geneva, Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich.
Pressure to enter an alliance stems from the need to compete with larger
carriers which have the muscle to benefit from greater liberalisation and
globalisation of the airline business. These carriers are themselves seeking
co-operation agreements and equity investments in other airlines.
However, the question of eventual submergence of the four airlines' present
identities into a full merger with a common 'brandname' has so far been left
open in recognition of potential political objections.

FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: Debt crisis at Ferruzzi deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the embattled agro-industrial and chemicals group, has failed to
meet payments on some of its financial commitments since the end of last
month. The failure indicates the depth of the crisis facing Italy's second
biggest private-sector company.
The news, contained in a letter from the company to its five main bank
creditors, triggered a collapse of almost 6 per cent, to L760.1, in the
shares of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company yesterday.
Investors have given vent to growing fears about the group's ability to
remain afloat in its present form.
The falls came as a key ministerial committee in Rome met for a second day
to discuss recent proposals by the Bank of Italy to allow commercial banks
to take equity stakes in industrial companies. Approving the measure is
vital for a widely-canvassed, but still unofficial, plan for creditor banks
to swap Ferfin debt for equity to go ahead.
The surprising disclosure about Ferfin's liquidity problems came in a
letter, leaked to the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, from the company to
the creditor committee.
Among other things, the letter reveals that Serafino Ferruzzi, the ultimate
holding company and wholly-owned by members of the Ferruzzi family, headed
by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, had debts of about L1,000bn (Dollars 684.5m) at the
end of last year.
In a sign of the gravity of the situation, the Ferruzzis, who control about
48 per cent of Ferfin, state their readiness to put up their Ferfin shares
as collateral to the banks. The Ferruzzis also declare their readiness to
step back from group management and to freeze their equity holdings, as well
as to open Serafino Ferruzzi to outside shareholders if necessary.
A separate letter from Ferfin to the creditor banks confirms the listed
company's readiness to hand over control to the bank creditors. The letter
says all the group's boards of directors were ready to stand down in favour
of bank-appointed alternatives, as is senior management.
Ferfin's letter says it will freeze all strategic decisions, such as
acquisitions, subject to approval from the banks. It also invites the five
banks to bring in other institutions, particularly foreigners, into the
creditors' committee.
'Our company believes the present situation, which cannot be tackled using
internal resources, requires an urgent restructuring of the whole group,
including the injection of fresh cash. The controlling shareholders of our
company are not able to supply the financial resources necessary to put such
a programme into effect'.
Ferfin, which has grown ambitiously since the mid-1980s, last month
announced record losses of L1,519bn and net debts of L15,123bn. Total group
borrowings approach L31,000bn.
Montedison, the main industrial operating subsidiary, lost L1,244bn in 1992.
Shares in Montedison largely resisted the downward trend yesterday, with a
fall of just 0.5 per cent decline to L975. However, the equity collapsed in
after-hours trading, with a fall to a low of L880 before recovering
slightly.
The drop was matched by a precipitous fall in the price of Montedison's
non-voting savings stock, which closed 2.5 per cent down on the day at L505
before falling further to L452 in after-hours trading.

FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: NY Times buys stronger voice in
US north-east - The Boston Globe's disposal ends 100 years of family control
and further concentrates newspaper ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE owners of the The Boston Globe have succumbed to the New York Times
Company and agreed to sell out for Dollars 1.1bn. The sale ends more than
100 years of family control of the newspaper.
The takeover turns the New York Times Company into the fifth largest
newspaper chain in the US, with combined daily circulation of its titles
climbing to 2.5m. It becomes the dominant voice in the north-east of the US,
with dozens of papers stretching from Maine to Washington. It also makes it
the owner of the two largest newspapers in New York and New England.
The purchase also adds to the growing concentration of the US newspaper
industry, as independents pass into the hands of the large chains.
The US's five largest newspaper companies - Gannet, Knight-Ridder, Newhouse,
Times Mirror and now the New York Times - have combined daily sales of over
18m copies.
While the Times heralded the purchase as an 'outstanding strategic fit', it
further exposes the company to stagnant print journalism, and the struggling
north-eastern economy. Analysts expressed surprise at how much the Times is
paying, with the Dollars 1.1bn price tag valuing the Globe at more than 36
times last year's profits, and 2.4 times revenues.
'I'm not sure investing this amount of money in an industry as mature as the
newspapers is the best use of cash,' says Mr Lanny Baker, a media analyst at
Morgan Stanley in New York. 'They are paying at the top end of the range.
But it depends on what they make of the paper after they have bought it.'
Mr Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, defended the
merger against critics of the deal, telling his own newspaper: 'I think it's
going to be a very, very long time before newspapers disappear.' He said he
was not just buying a newspaper, but an organisation that gathered news, and
that would be ready for the electronic age.
The Times will likely offer joint advertising sales with the Globe. The
merger, said Mr Sulzberger, 'provides the opportunity for a new and exciting
way of selling national and retail advertising to clients targeting the
entire north-east market - an opportunity that could not be duplicated by
any combination of newspapers or other media'.
In Boston, many expressed sadness that the Globe, which has been controlled
by the Taylor and Jordan families since 1873, was being swallowed by a
chain, albeit the sober New York Times.
The Globe, a self-styled 'serious' newspaper, follows an independent,
liberal editorial line, and for some readers is almost as part of Boston
identity as the Red Sox baseball team.
The Globe sold out in the end because, of all the suitors, the Times
appeared most likely to preserve its independence.
'If there is going to be a partnership, the Times is sure a classy act to
hop into bed with,' said Mr Thomas Winship, former editor of the Boston
Globe. 'It bodes well for the future of New England, that desperately needs
a feisty, caring newspaper.'
In 1996, family trusts owned by Jordans and Taylors expire, making the
Globe's parent company, Affiliated Publications, vulnerable to a hostile
takeover. With some 100 heirs apparently eager to cash in on the family
inheritance, the Taylors dared not wait.
The Times has agreed to pay an equivalent of Dollars 15 a share for
Affiliated, a 21 per cent premium over Affiliated's stock price on May 28,
when rumours of the merger circulated. The Times will offer its own stock,
but owners of Affiliated 'A' shares can take up to 15 per cent of their
shares in cash.
The Globe has a week-day circulation of 504,869, making it the US's 13th
largest newspaper, and far larger than its nearest local rival, the Boston
Herald, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Company.
The New York Times has a daily circulation of 1.2m, while its parent company
owns 31 regional newspapers, 20 magazines and 5 television companies.
The takeover gives the New York Times Company 60 per cent of the seats on
The Boston Globe board. However, The Globe is being promised full management
and editorial autonomy, partly allaying fears in a city notoriously
sensitive to being in New York's shadow that the takeover will lead to too
much outside interference.

<TEXT>
TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, has
suspended common-share dividends pending the outcome of a plan to
restructure its CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.17bn) debt.
The Calgary-based company, controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, aims to
present its debt-restructuring and recapitalisation proposals by the end of
July.
About CDollars 1.7bn of principal payments, mostly on mortgage loans, are
due before the end of 1995. The proposals include delayed preferred share
redemptions and extended debt maturities.
The semi-annual dividend has gradually been cut over the past 18 months,
from 18 to 5 cents a share.
In a further effort to boost liquidity, Trizec has sold a number of assets,
including the bulk of its 23 per cent stake in Rouse Co, a leading US
shopping mall developer. It is also seeking a buyer for up to 50 per cent of
its retirement home subsidiary.
Trizec posted net earnings of CDollars 5m, equal to a loss of 3.4 cents a
share, in the six months to April 30, down from CDollars 12m, or a loss of
1.4 cents a share, a year earlier.
The accounts of Bramalea, the Toronto-based developer, are no longer
consolidated, Trizec's stake having been cut from 72 to 20 per cent.

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, yesterday raised its
ratings on Chase Manhattan following the New York banking group's sale of
Dollars 649m of new shares, writes Martin Dickson.
S&amp;P raised the rating on Chase's senior debt from triple-B-plus to
single-A-minus. Two other agencies, Fitch and Duff &amp; Phelps, also raised
their ratings on the bank.
Chase announced on Thursday that its offering of 22m shares, first announced
in April, had been priced at Dollars 29.50 a share. That was substantially
below the Dollars 750m the bank hoped to raise in April.

FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japanese securities houses cut
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S profit-starved securities houses plan to cut their capital spending
by 68.1 per cent this year, according to a survey of financial institutions
released yesterday by the Bank of Japan.
The country's banks, burdened by bad loans and attempting to cut costs, plan
to reduce spending on items such as computers and branch facilities by 17.3
per cent in the year to March, following a 6.2 per cent fall last year.
Response to the survey suggests trading conditions are unlikely to improve
in the second half. On average, capital spending will rise 2.5 per cent in
the first half, compared to a year earlier, but fall 17.8 per cent in the
second half.
Nomura Securities was the only leading Japanese broker to report a net
profit last year, reflecting the pressure created by the collapse of stock
prices and trading volumes. Although the market has strengthened in recent
months, there are lingering concerns that prices and volumes will fall
again.
Most brokers have announced reductions in their staff intake and delayed
investment on new computer equipment and the renovation of offices. The
sharp reductions in spending, which fell 46 per cent last year, are partly a
reaction to the excessive expansion during the four years to 1990, when
securities industry personnel increased by 41.6 per cent.
The spending cuts have hurt the country's electronics companies, which would
expect to get most of the contracts.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold struggles to stay
above Dollars 370
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market struggled to avoid a decisive fall below the
psychologically-important Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce level this week. The
price twice dipped below that level but the return of light physical buying
interest helped it to close in London yesterday at Dollars 371.15 an ounce,
down Dollars 3.45 on the week.
Uncertainty following the volatile trading of the preceding Friday - when a
Dollars 4.35 jump in the was followed by an equally sudden Dollars 3 fall -
meant that buyers were few and far between on Monday. Having seen the market
survive several tests of support at Dollars 372 an ounce on that day,
however, the buyers returned on Tuesday. But they soon began to retreat in
the face of strong resistance near the Dollars 376-an-ounce mark. Renewed
falls on Wednesday and Thursday morning saw the Dollars 372 level
established as a position of upside resistance, rather than of downside
support, and that resistance continued to hold yesterday.
Traders were not committing themselves about the probable direction of the
next move, explaining that the market was so evenly poised that it could be
easily moved quite sharply by either bullish or bearish developments. A
further fall to Dollars 365 an ounce was not ruled out, but most thought the
present period of consolidation would be followed by re-establishment of the
uptrend.
Platinum followed gold lower this week but palladium, its sister metal, put
in another firm performance. Strong Japanese demand - the metal is at
present relatively cheap in yen terms - and good industrial demand in North
America and Europe helped palladium's price to rise by Dollars 3.25 on the
week to a 38-month high of Dollars 127 an ounce.
Copper this week lead a general decline in London Metal Exchange prices that
was resisted only by aluminium.
The exchange's flagship contract began with an attempt to consolidate
following last Friday's late price collapse, which saw the three month's
position relinquish Dollars 85 of the week's Dollars 145 advance, to finish
at Dollars 1,855 a tonne for the three months delivery contract. But it
could not be prevented from edging down into a lower trading range, and
upside resistance was soon established about Dollars 10 below that level.
On Thursday a peak of Dollars 1,867 was reached in response to overnight
strength in the New York market. But there was no follow-through buying,
either in London or in New York, and liquidation took the price back to
Dollars 1,840 at the end of the day. Further selling yesterday morning took
the three months position down further to Dollars 1,823 a tonne, but by the
close it had steadied to Dollars 1,830 a tonne.
Dealers blamed the continuing bearish supply/demand position for the
market's renewed weakness. They noted that the latest rise in LME warehouse
stocks had taken the total to 436,300 tonnes, the highest since September
1978.
Sentiment in the zinc market was again undermined by copper's slide,
together with the metal's own bearish chart patterns and fundamentals.
An unbroken sequence of relatively modest daily declines added up to a
Dollars 34 fall on the week for the three months position. Yesterday's
closing quotation of Dollars 934.50 was a six-year low and dealers said
that, with LME warehouse stocks moving ever higher and refined supply
continuing to outstrip demand, the near term technical objective was Dollars
920 a tonne.
Another big loser at the LME was nickel, which, despite the announcement of
a substantial LME stocks fall yesterday, ended Dollars 175 down on the week
for three months metal, at Dollars 5,617.50 a tonne.
Lead lost most the the rally prompted last week by the announcement of
further production cuts. The three months position closed yesterday at
Pounds 267.75 a tonne, down Pounds 6 on the week.
Bucking the trend was aluminium, which scored its third successive weekly
gain. Investment fund and speculative buying helped the three months price
to defy bouts of profit-taking and rise by Dollars 13.25 overall to Dollars
1,182.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, just below an earlier 12-week high.
Dealers suggested that the market was still on course to test upside
resistance at Dollars 1,200 a tonne.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange traders drew little comfort from
the progress made at a negotiating session in London towards agreeing a new
producer/consumer agreement with price-stabilisation efforts based on
production restraint. The market's main concern is about the bearish impact
on prices of arrangements in any new pact for disposing of the International
Cocoa Organisation's 232,000-tonne buffer stock.
Meanwhile the London market remained lethargic, with modest gains in the
first four days being mostly wiped out yesterday as prices were depressed by
a rise in sterling and selling by a leading London trader.
Coffee remained depressed following last week's breach of support at 60 US
cents a lb in New York.
At The London Future's and Options Exchange's robusta futures market
repeated attempts to push nearby prices into the middle of the recent
Dollars 900- to Dollars 950-a-tonne range were frustrated by lack of
supporting fundamental factors. Prices were caught between roaster buying
interest and producer selling, particularly from Brazil and Indonesia,
dealers said.
At yesterday's close the September position was quoted at Dollars 903 a
tonne, down Dollars 15 on the week.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron creditor threatens to challenge
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CREDITOR of Heron, the property group headed by Mr Gerald Ronson, is
threatening to challenge the group's financial restructuring and has called
on other creditors to join the action.
An advertisement placed in yesterday's Financial Times was signed by a
company called First Eastern Developments. It said the documents Heron had
issued in connection with the refinancing omitted important information.
Heron said the advertisement 'would appear to have been placed on the
specific instructions' of Stratagem Development Corporation, which is suing
Heron over the development of a property in New York, claiming damages of
Dollars 22.25m (Pounds 14.4m).
Heron said that it and its advisers 'deny that there is any omission of
important information from the scheme document'. It said the document
contained all the information creditors needed to make an informed decision
and 'there is no question of Heron's banks receiving an 'inappropriate
preference'.'
Heron has denied the allegations Stratagem has made in its law suit and has
made counter claims.
The move adds to unhappiness among some of Heron's bondholders about the
refinancing. Heron has said that if the refinancing deal is not acc-epted
then it would be forced to start bankruptcy proceedings, leaving creditors
with less than they would obtain through the refinancing.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: DTI launches investigation into Alpine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has launched an investigation into the
affairs of Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading at the end of May.
The inquiry follows several approaches to the DTI from former employees over
the last six months.
The DTI is investigating under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985. This
authorises an officer of the department to require a company, or its present
or former employees to produce documents and provide explanations.
The DTI would also have powers to extend the investigation to a body, which,
although incorporated outside Britain, has been carrying on business in the
UK. Based on its findings the DTI would decide whether to launch a full
investigation.
Alpine was put into administrative receivership last week. A creditors'
meeting to vote on liquidation is to be held on Tuesday in London.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles debt talks came close to failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCLUSION of the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, the parent of
the Gateway supermarket group, came close to failure, bankers involved in
the deal said yesterday, when one party to the transaction refused to sign
for more than 24 hours after the others had.
Signing began on Tuesday morning and all parties had been signed up by late
that afternoon except for the outstanding party, which is understood not to
have been a senior lender to the group.
That party signed on Wednesday evening, just meeting deadlines allowing
Isosceles' banks, led by Midland Bank, and Isosceles' advisers Hill Samuel,
to go through procedures necessary before the standstill agreement with
banks expired.
The restructuring, Isosceles' third since it completed a Pounds 2bn
leveraged buy-out of the Gateway group in 1989, was its last chance to avoid
receivership. One banker said yesterday that 'if the deal hadn't been signed
on Wednesday night the shops would have been closed by now, and 40,000 jobs
gone.'
About 30 banks were involved in the deal which has been negotiated since the
standstill agreement was signed just before Christmas. It will now be
approved at a special meeting on July 2, where more than 90 per cent of
shareholders have undertaken to vote in favour.
While the deal was not as complex as other restructurings of the same size,
it was completed relatively rapidly and the fees involved are expected to be
about Pounds 15m. It had its fair share of dramas, though, with the Bank of
England becoming involved when three French banks demanded preferential
treatment.
Under the deal Gateway is ring fenced from Isosceles and has taken on Pounds
500m of debt, a level of borrowings which Gateway should be able to service
while also spending about Pounds 100m a year on capital investment.
Isosceles' assets were transferred to the new Gateway company at a value of
Pounds 525m.
With operating profits for the year to end-April expected to total Pounds
100m Gateway can clearly pay an interest charge which would be about Pounds
37.5m annually. Gateway has no repayments to make for three years. At that
point options will be reviewed again and there could be a sale of the
business either in whole or in part to repay debt.
Isosceles is keeping the rest of the debt, totalling Pounds 949m. That will
have to be serviced from any surplus cash passed up to Isosceles from
Gateway. Its assets, apart from its shareholding in Gateway, are minor and
include a golf course in Hertfordshire.
Of the Isosceles debt Pounds 256m is senior debt, and bankers involved feel
there is a good chance that this can be serviced. However, there are doubts
that the rest of the Isosceles debt, including a Pounds 400m zero coupon
bond due to mature in 10 years, and certainly the ordinary shares, will ever
have any economic value.
Even so, some shareholders, notably Wasserstein Perella, the New York
investment house, and the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US food
retailer, have agreed to swap for a share in a 10-year option to buy
ordinary shares equivalent to 25 per cent of the company for Pounds 12.5m.
This was said to be a face-saving formula, devised for example to allow WP
to ascribe a value to its Isosceles stake held in an investment fund.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Osborne &amp; Little better than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Osborne &amp; Little rose by 16p to 113p yesterday after the wallpaper
and furnishing fabrics group reported better than expected trading results
and announced a dividend increase.
However, a Pounds 1.2m exceptional loss on the sale in August of Fardis, its
French subsidiary, meant the group suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 98,000
in the year to March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 855,000 the
previous year.
There was a loss of 8.12p per share (7.83p earnings) but Sir Peter Osborne,
chairman, said that the group's stronger balance sheet and improved trading
results justified a 10.6 per cent increase in the final dividend to 2.6p
(2.35p) per share, making a 4.6p (4.35p) total.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 19.1m), including Pounds 1.83m
(Pounds 5.65m) from discontinued operations, but the contribution from
continuing operations grew by 19 per cent.
Operating profits slipped slightly to Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.38m) but were
ahead by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.04m) on a continuing
operations basis. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 224,000 (Pounds
525,000).
The group's expanding US operations boosted sales by 29 per cent which Sir
Peter described as 'an exceptional result against the background of a very
depressed home furnishings market.'
In the UK, however, where the group closed its Edinburgh showroom, sales
only increased by 4 per cent.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rock falls to make way for chemicals - The
change of direction by the world leader in china clay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Andrew Teare left Rugby cement group in 1990 to become chief
executive of English China Clays it was assumed he had come to expand its
building material interests.
Three years later the former Rugby managing director is taking the company
in a completely different direction - hiving off the construction operations
and expanding into speciality chemicals.
ECC will concentrate its activities around its mainstream business as the
world's largest supplier of china clay, mainly for fillers and coatings for
the paper industry.
Mr Teare argues that the acquisition of Calgon, announced yesterday, will
complement ECC's business which has become increasingly sophisticated in the
use and development of speciality chemicals for paper-making and other
processes.
About 67 per cent of Calgon's sales of water-soluble polymers and biocides
are for water treatment, a market in which it is the third largest supplier
in the US behind Nalco Chemical and Betz Laboratories.
Only 20 per cent of sales its sales are to the paper industry. Sales outside
the US account for less than 20 per cent.
By comparison ECC sells in more than 100 countries. It is a market leader in
western Europe and the US following its acquisition of Georgia Kaolin in
1990.
Mr Stephen Kirk, conglomerates analyst with Nikko Europe says: 'The
acquisition of Calgon makes great sense. Calgon will have access to ECC's
international marketing operations and should be able to increase its sales
to the paper industry, particularly in the US where ECC is strong.
'ECC will be able to broaden its product mix in a complementary business.
Water treatment is a particularly good market to be in, given environmental
pressures.'
The ability to increase Calgon's sales should help net margins which at 10
per cent compare unfavourably with the 16 per cent achieved by rivals Nalco
and Betz, according to Mr Teare. He claims the acquisition will be earnings
neutral in its first full year, despite the high purchase cost.
He says that to maintain ECC's building materials business would involve the
group in capital expenditure of between Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m a year just
to keep its stone quarries, lorries, crushers and other equipment in good
working order. This money could be better spent elsewhere.
Mr Teare favours a demerger, similar to that which has just taken place at
ICI, under which existing stockholders will be given shares in both
companies.
'I believe shareholders get the best value this way,' he says. He also
argues that demerger motivates managers better than the threat of sale. ECC,
however, does not expect a demerger before annual results for 1993 are
published next spring.
It has not ruled out a sale of the business, although Mr Teare says this is
unlikely. Analysts yesterday put the value of the business at between Pounds
150m and Pounds 180m.
ECC produces about 4 per cent of all aggregates supplied to the UK
construction industry and 4 per cent of coated stone used in road building.
It vies with a handful of rivals for the position of the UK's fifth largest
quarry operator, behind market leaders Tarmac, Hanson, RMC and Redland.
Profits, however, have suffered as UK construction output has slumped. Last
year the business, which includes a quarry operation in Denver in the US,
made operating profits of Pounds 15.5m on sales of Pounds 352.4m. A few
years ago profits were about Pounds 50m on roughly the same turnover, says
ECC.
Most of the company's quarries are in south west England. Its most
attractive asset, however, is the Croft 'super quarry' one of a ring of very
large granite quarries in Leicestershire. Croft has the capacity to produce
3m tonnes of stone a year, compared with group production of 13m tonnes last
year.
The business might prove attractive to a company like Wimpey which has a
similar market share but has indicated that it wants to expand. Wimpey this
week announced a Pounds 104m rights issue to buy housing land and to expand
its minerals operations.
RMC, the only one of the big four aggregate producers without a
Leicestershire 'super quarry' might also be interested in making a purchase,
say analysts. Another interested party might be Minorco the international
mining business.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: English China Clays calls for Pounds 113m -
Second rights in 16 months will help fund Dollars 308m acquisition of Calgon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ENGLISH CHINA Clays, the world's biggest producer of china clay, yesterday
announced a Pounds 113.4m rights issue, a Dollars 307.5m (Pounds 202m) US
acquisition and plans to hive off its building materials business into a
separate company.
The announcements mark a further stage in the reorganisation of the company
which had previously announced it was pulling out of UK housebuilding.
ECC is acquiring Calgon, the US speciality chemicals business, from Merck
the US drugs group.
To help pay for the deal ECC has proposed a 1-for-8 rights issue at 350p a
share to raise Pounds 113.4m. The rest of the cash is to be provided from
increased borrowings. According to Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, this
will raise the company's gearing from 24 per cent to 39 per cent.
In addition, the company announced plans to demerge its UK and US quarry
operations into a separate company. This was not expected to take place
until next year.
Mr Teare said the group wanted to concentrate its efforts on developing
higher margin speciality chemicals alongside its mainstream business of
supplying china clay, used mainly for coating and fillers by the paper
industry.
It is the second rights issue to be launched by the group in 16 months - in
February last year it raised Pounds 209m to pay for the early redemption of
Dollars 350m of of US auction market preferred shares (Amps).
The company also announced yesterday that it planned to redeem its remaining
Dollars 50m of preference shares.
ECC's share price, despite the second cash call on shareholders, rose 9p to
425p. Calgon, which produces water-soluble polymers and biocides mainly for
water treatment made unaudited operating profits of Dollars 24.1m on sales
of Dollars 225.1m in 1992.
Just over 85 per cent of ECC's profits of Pounds 105.6m (Pounds 95.5m) last
year were generated by by its china clay operations. Operating profits from
building materials, however, slipped from Pounds 24.6m Pounds 15.5m.
Brokers to the rights issue, which has been underwritten by Schroders, are
SG Warburg and de Zoete &amp; Bevan. The company yesterday renewed its pledge to
at least maintain its 1993 dividend at 20p.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: BA proposes changes to boardroom election
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is proposing to change its articles of association to
require its senior executives to seek periodic re-election by shareholders.
In the past, under previous chairman Lord King, BA's chairman, chief
executive and one other executive director did not need to be re-elected.
The change, which will be put to shareholders at BA's annual meeting next
month, will be seen as another attempt by the company's new management under
chairman Sir Colin Marshall to improve the board's accountability.
BA has also increased the number and scope of its non-executive directors in
a bid to comply with best practice following criticism in the wake of the
Virgin 'dirty tricks' allegations.
The proposals are revealed in BA's annual report, delivered to shareholders
yesterday. The report confirmed the company spent Pounds 3m in legal fees
connected to the January settlement of libel litigation with Virgin and Mr
Richard Branson. BA said a litigation provision of Pounds 22m, carried
forward from previous years, would be retained.
The annual report also showed Lord King received no performance bonus last
year, and saw his salary and emoluments fall from Pounds 669,350 to Pounds
478,790 in the 11 months before his resignation in February.
Sir Colin Marshall received emoluments of Pounds 86,691 in the period
February 5 to March 31.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: City fears cut in final dividend from BET
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRELIMINARY results on Monday from BET, the industrial services group, are
likely to produce further disappointment, including a cut in the final
dividend.
At the interim stage last November, five months after a Pounds 200m rights
issue, Mr John Clark, chief executive, said it was the board's current
intention to maintain the final 6.5p dividend.
But in the run-up to Monday's results, the market has come to expect a
dividend cut and further provisions to reorganise businesses and asset
write-downs.
The shares had risen from a low in April of 85p to 115p but this week fell
back to 108p ahead of the results.
The interim dividend was cut from 4.25p to 2p. Robert Fleming Securities
expects a final dividend of 2.5p while Morgan Stanley expects a larger cut.
More worrying to shareholders who took up the June 1992 rights issue, may be
the fears among analysts that BET has not yet reorganised the business into
a shape which will provide a firm foundation from which to grow when the
recovery takes root.
Many of BET's businesses have low barriers to entry and have consequently
faced significant margin pressure in addition to the difficulties growing
sales.
'Rather than being poised for recovery,' says research from Fleming, 'BET is
still restructuring and trying to refine its portfolio down to its strongest
core businesses.'
The rights issue has, however, allowed BET to improve its balance sheet by
repaying most of its auction market preferred stock.
Robert Fleming expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 67m before the
restructuring costs.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alvis agrees electro-optics reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALVIS, the defence contractor, announced a reorganisation of its
electro-optics activities, which involves the transfer of three businesses
to the group's Avimo Singapore subsidiary. Shares in Alvis, formerly United
Scientific Holdings, rose by 6p to 44p.
The Singapore-listed subsidiary, in which Alvis has a 51 per cent stake,
will acquire the businesses - Helio, Avimo Taunton, and AIO - in a deal
worth Pounds 17.1m.
Alvis, which makes armoured vehicles, will use the proceeds to pursue other
areas of interest, either in defence or specialist engineering. It said
grouping the electro-optics companies under a single focused management
should increase their market penetration and profitability.
Mr Nick Prest, chief executive of Alvis, said: 'The greater resources and
flexibility afforded by this reorganisation should substantially strengthen
the future development prospects of Alvis.'
Helio, based in Kent, produces periscopes and turrets for armoured vehicles.
Avimo Taunton makes military sights in Somerset. UIL holds a 49 per cent
stake in AIO, which was established as a joint venture with the Egyptian
government in 1982 to manufacture electro-optical instruments in Cairo.
The payment for the transfer will comprise Pounds 8.2m in cash and the issue
to Alvis of 14.9m new ordinary shares in Avimo Singapore at a price of
SDollars 1.50.
Mr Tony Pearson, Alvis's finance director, said the company would have net
cash of about Pounds 13m after the deal was concluded. The transfer would
dilute earnings in the short term, but Alvis had no intentions of just
sitting on the proceeds.
The Singapore company will fund the cash element of the transaction by
making a 3-for-8 rights issue to its minority shareholders, underwritten by
Morgan Grenfell (Asia). The net effect of will be to increase Alvis's stake
in Avimo Singapore from 51 to 51.3 per cent.
Alvis yesterday also announced a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 2.19m in the six months to March 31. Turnover increased from Pounds
42m to Pounds 45.8m.
The improvement in pre-tax profit derived from an increase of more than 50
per cent in group operating profit to Pounds 1.26m and a greatly enhanced
contribution from AIO, its Egyptian associate.
Alvis said the performance at Alvis Industries was disappointing. Group
order intake for the first half was Pounds 34m (Pounds 47m).
Earnings per share were 0.1p against losses of 0.8p while the interim
dividend was held at 0.5p.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ritblat borrows to buy shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN RITBLAT, chairman of British Land, entered yesterday into a loan
agreement to finance his purchase of 1m British Land shares. The agreement
limits his exposure to price movements of the shares being used as security
for the loan.
'These arrangements contain certain provisions which will limit his exposure
to movements in the price of these shares being provided as security for the
loan, between today's date and 6th July ,1994,' the company said in an
announcement to the Stock Exchange yesterday.
Mr Ritblat declined to discuss the loan. 'It is nothing to do with the
public. It is my private affair.' he said.
The shares being acquired by Mr Ritblat are part of an incentive arrangement
made by some British Land executives with the Quantum Fund, managed by Mr
George Soros.
On June 2, when British Land announced its Pounds 132m rights issue and a
partnership with the Quantum Fund, it said that Mr Ritblat would acquire 2m
British Land shares. At least 1m of these shares were to be acquired from
Quantum at Quantum's cost price.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coats acquires Dutch fashion group for
Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COATS VIYELLA, the textiles and clothing company, has acquired Berghaus
International Fashion Group, a Dutch-based distributor of ladies outer wear,
for up to Pounds 35m.
The deal means Coats has realised its ambition to start clothes distribution
in continental Europe. Its clothing activities have so far mainly been UK
based.
Berghaus is also well established in the former USSR, which Coats left in
1917. 'We've had aspirations in Russia and they know how to deal and how to
get paid,' according to Mr Russell Walls, Coats' group finance director.
Berghaus, which is unrelated to the UK manufacturer of outdoor equipment,
has two small factories but relies on sourcing from eastern Europe and the
Far East for about 90 per cent of sales. In 1992 the company made pre-tax
and interest profits of Fl 12.7m (Pounds 4.6m) on sales of Fl 218m.
The company sells ladies coats and jackets throughout western Europe under
the Berghaus, Damo and Polar Bear brands. Its sales network is slightly
skewed towards northern Europe. It also supplies ladies outer wear to Marks
&amp; Spencer, one of Coats most important clothing clients.
Coats raised the acquisition finance through a placing yesterday morning to
institutions, arranged by Cazenove and BZW, of 15.2m shares at 218p. Coats'
shares fell 3p to 224p.
Coats' net borrowings remain quite high, with gearing over 50 per cent at
the year end, following the 1991 acquisition of Tootal.
All of the Berghaus management have agreed to stay for 'the medium term' and
will retain day to day control, Mr Walls said.
The purchase price included Fl 22.6m of goodwill and Fl 35.5m of debt. Also
included is a maximum of Fl 1.5m if Berghaus achieves certain profit
targets.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Hog wild in Milwaukee: Bikers are celebrating more than a
90th birthday at Harley-Davidson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be Hog Heaven. About 60,000 leather-clad motor cyclists will rumble
into the US city of Milwaukee today to celebrate one of the greatest icons
of American popular culture - the Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
It is 90 years since the first crude Harley was assembled in the Davidson
family's Milwaukee backyard, and to mark the occasion convoys of bikers have
spent the past week riding their Harleys - which enthusiasts call 'hogs' -
to the city from every corner of North America.
Today they will party. By the shore of Lake Michigan they will eat, drink
and rock to the sounds of ZZ Top, a band whose members ride customised
Harleys known as Hogzillas.
Some of the aficionados will get married, taking their vows in a riot of
gleaming chrome and buffed leather on the front steps of that holy of
holies, the red brick Harley-Davidson headquarters building. The brides,
naturally, will wear black.
But this is much more than a birthday party. It will also celebrate the
revival of a company which 10 years ago seemed to be at death's door,
another example of an industry killed by competition from Japan.
Instead, Harley has beaten back rivals such as Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki,
and its share of the US market for big bikes (over 850ccs) has risen to
about 60 per cent from a nadir of 23 per cent in 1983, even though the
overall market has dropped substantially during the decade.
Harley is starting to focus more on international sales, where it sees big
growth potential, since it has only 10 to 15 per cent of the market outside
America.
However, its machines are so popular in the US - despite often having a much
higher price tag than Japanese rivals - that the company cannot keep pace
with demand, even though it has more than doubled annual output over the
past six years to about 80,000 cycles. The bikes have to be painstakingly
rationed out among dealers, with only 30 per cent reserved for the export
market.
The turnaround is a case study in how western companies can take on the
Japanese and win, helped by a degree of protectionism, attention to quality,
employee involvement and, in Harley's case, clever marketing.
For the company is selling far more than a humble means of transport. It is
marketing a lifestyle - what executives refer to as 'the Harley experience'.
This blends images of macho, rebellious US individuality and personal
freedom - a Harley rider alone on the open road, somewhere in the vastness
of America - with down-to-earth group social events organised by the
company.
The Harley motto - 'Live to ride, ride to live ' - has an irresistible
appeal to many people trapped in humdrum jobs. Ageing baby boomers find
solace in the suggestion that a Harley engine contains the elixir of youth.
'A Harley-Davidson is ageless and timeless,' runs one advertisement. 'On it,
you cannot grow old.'
All this has helped the company broaden the appeal of its products beyond
the industry's traditional young, male, blue-collar customers to
professionals, the middle-aged, and women.
The average US owner, according to the company's market research, is 38,
married, with a household income of Dollars 43,000 a year. Some 20 per cent
of buyers are women. Harley maintains that Hell's Angels, one of the
company's most visible customer groups, make up only 1 per cent of the
total.
None of this recent marketing success would have been possible without the
particular mystique which has long surrounded Harley, making it seem the
serious biker's bike. This is partly to do with Harley's styling - raw, yet
glamorous - and partly with its V-twin engine, which gives out a distinctive
thump likened by some to the beat of the heart.
The image has been powerfully reinforced by Hollywood. Peter Fonda rode a
modified Harley in the classic 1960s road movie, Easy Rider. Arnold
Schwarzenegger mounted a Harley Fat Boy in Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
Still, the brand name was little help at the start of the 1980s, when
Harley's market share skidded because of quality problems. Its engines were
technologically primitive and tended to leak oil, while an attempt to expand
production rapidly meant half the machines coming off its assembly line had
missing parts.
In 1983, the loss-making business was sold by the then owner, the
conglomerate AMF, to its management, and many observers predicted early
bankruptcy.
However, the new team radically changed the way it made bikes, imitating
Japanese methods of quality control. Says Mr Jeffrey Bleustein, who heads
the motorcycle operations: 'It took us a while before we realised they (the
Japanese) were just better managers than we were.'
Harley also developed a more sophisticated engine, got government help (in
the form of tariffs on Japanese imports, lifted in 1987) and, in 1986, eased
its heavy debt burden with a public flotation.
Despite the surge in demand for its products, the company has been careful
to expand production gradually. Stung by poor quality once, it does not want
a repeat performance.
Unlike many consumer product companies, Harley concentrates most of its
marketing expenditure on customers after they have bought its machines. The
idea is to hook them for life on 'the Harley experience', buying more and
more expensive bikes when they trade their old ones in. The price range runs
from around Dollars 4,800 (Pounds 3,100) to more than Dollars 16,000.
Central to this was the formation of the Harley Owners' Group - Hog for
short - a club restricted to Harley buyers, which organises rallies and
charity fund-raisers.
It not only promotes a sense of exclusivity and purpose among owners, but
also gives the company valuable feedback on fashion trends among bikers, who
like to customise their machines with individual flourishes.
'The motorcycles are the canvas, the parts and accessories are the paint;
that's where everyone can express their individuality,' says Mr Jerry Wilke,
marketing chief.
A central figure at the rallies is Harley's head of design, Mr William
Davidson, known as 'Willie G', a grandson of one the company's founders. He
has been responsible for many of the company's most important model
innovations, such as the 1971 Super Glide with its extended front forks, and
the 1977 Low Rider, with its seat close to the ground.
Many bikers think he embodies the soul of the company. With his thick beard,
dark glasses and fringed leather jacket he looks the part. Fans often ask
him to carve his name with a screwdriver in the metal of their machines.
However, Harley's top executives are all keen bikers and are leading each of
the 90th anniversary convoys across country towards Milwaukee, raising money
for charity as they go. It is hard to get closer to the customer than that.
Another important marketing initiative has been to encourage Harley dealers
to transform their outlets from grimy workshops into attractive retail
outlets, selling not only bikes but a broad range of Harley brand
accessories, clothes and momentos, made by or licensed from the company.
Women can buy black Harley bathing suits, with the company name studded
across the front.
All this has transformed Harley's profits. It made Dollars 53.8m last year
on turnover of Dollars 1.1bn. Debt on the balance sheet is now negligible.
Next month it will mark a milestone on its return to financial health by
paying its first dividend since flotation.
The recent record, however, is not flawless. The company also owns Holiday
Rambler, which makes Recreational Vehicles - caravan-like trucks in which
Americans cruise around the continent. Holiday Rambler makes little money
(it lost Dollars 13m in 1991) and Wall Street would like Harley to sell the
business.
Industry observers are also a little edgy about the company's plan to expand
motorcycle production by 25 per cent by 1996 to 100,000 a year. Harley
insists that it will do so in a way which retains the quality of its bikes
and service, but the analysts note that it suffered hiccups recently with a
new paint plant.
Some also ask whether Harley's popularity, as well as a small upturn in the
US motorbike market in the past two years, could be a fad.
But Mr Richard Teerlink, the chief executive, although concerned about the
company growing arrogant, says confidently: 'This is a fad that has been
going on for a long time - 90 years.'

May 29-30) that he often feels moral unease when in the company of the rich
because '. . .they are insulated from the pain and vulnerability of the bulk
of humanity', and they 'cannot bear very much human reality'. Does he really
believe that the rich are insulated from the pain of bereavement, of
illness, of marital break-up?
He describes the rich as 'kindly, witty and urbane'. Does this not suggest
that they have had more opportunities to cultivate the higher human
sensibilities than those whose lives have been coarsened by deprivation? Has
not this cultivation often produced great acts of philanthropy?
The dean expresses his approval of a visitor from the Sudan who declined an
offer of supper from his hostess after he had been given a substantial lunch
on the ground that 'we only eat every other day'. He was 'a vigorous, good
and happy man'.
Good and happy, perhaps, but no nutritionist would suggest that such a diet
is conducive to vigour.
Mr Dickenson fails to appreciate that the sense of deprivation a person
feels is always relative to his expectations. Someone who has never lived in
comfort is likely to miss it less than someone who has experienced it and is
then deprived of it by, say, redundancy and bankruptcy.

   From Mr S DICKINSON

Sir, Richard Layard (Personal View, June 8) provides a classic example of
what happens to economists in a depression: they become apologists for, not
analysts of, failure, and the purveyors of pernicious prescriptions. EC
unemployment has averaged 9 per cent in the past five years and is now back
to the double digits; job security in the US and Japan is also a thing of
the past. This indicates general stagnation, not a short-term aberration or
the failings of a few unfortunates in society.
Layard, in explaining unemployment, emphasises workers' attributes (skills
and price), rather than dismal returns on investment and the concomitant
failure to invest in future production. The cure for unemployment is sought
among its victims, not at the level of the economy as a whole. Unemployment,
for Layard, is a matter of benefits, training and wages. The cure? Cut
benefits, increase training and control wages. No matter how this is dressed
up it is an argument of the 'they're too stupid, too greedy and too lazy'
variety, whIch leads nicely into the 'they need whipping into shape'
argument. Such prejudice and support for authoritarian action by the state
makes one nostalgic for the 'get on your bike' idea.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Tyrannosaurus resurrectus: Fossil futures

Steven Spielberg describes his latest blockbuster film Jurassic Park, which
opened in the US last night, as 'not science fiction but science
eventuality'. The Hollywood publicity machine has made sure that most
Americans already know its plot: scientists use genetic engineering to
create a theme park with real dinosaurs which then run amok.
This week - with a sense of timing that the best Hollywood hype merchant
could not have matched - the venerable British research journal Nature
published evidence suggesting that the movie is slightly less far-fetched
than it may sound. A Californian research group including Dr George Poinar,
a scientific adviser to Jurassic Park, has extracted the first samples of
genetic material (DNA) from the dinosaur era.
Admittedly, the 120m-year-old DNA came from an extinct weevil rather than a
dinosaur. And the Californian scientists isolated just fragments of two
genes rather than the 100,000 or so complete genes that would provide full
instructions for anyone wanting to recreate the insect.
But they have demonstrated two propositions that would have seemed wildly
speculative less than 10 years ago. First, the DNA molecule is robust enough
to survive for millions of years under the right conditions. Second,
scientists can fish out microscopic quantities of DNA and then make billions
of copies for analysis (using gene-amplifying technology called polymerase
chain reaction).
The link between Jurassic Park and the Poinar group's real-life discovery is
amber, fossilised tree resin which has unique sealing and antiseptic
properties. It is a honey-coloured time capsule, transporting trapped
insects virtually intact from prehistoric forest to laboratory bench.
The Californian scientists worked on a tree-feeding weevil preserved in
amber from Jezzine, Lebanon. Michael Crichton, who wrote the novel, Jurassic
Park, imagined extracting DNA from blood in the gut of a mosquito that had
fed on a dinosaur just before it was trapped in the resin.
Unfortunately for the story, the vast majority of insects in amber are
species that live or feed on trees, such as weevils, termites, ants and
bees. Only a handful of specimens of blood-sucking insects are known from
the dinosaur era (older than 65m years) - and scientists will be
fantastically lucky if they contain dinosaur DNA that had not been broken
down by digestive juices.
The greatest possible piece of luck would be to find a recently hatched baby
dinosaur in amber - extremely unlikely but not out of the question. After
all, lizards and frogs have been preserved in 40m-year-old amber from the
Dominican Republic.
However, amber is not the only potential source of dinosaur DNA. In
exceptional cases, the molecules may be robust enough to survive inside
dinosaur fossils. Professor Jack Horner of Montana State University is
attempting to find genetic material in bones of the ferocious Tyrannosaurus
rex, which have been preserved in extremely dry sandstone beds.
Even if scientists do manage to extract dinosaur DNA from any source, it is
hard to see how this could include the whole genome - the blueprint that
would be the first requirement for resurrecting dinosaurs.
For the foreseeable future, any mad billionaire who really wants to create a
Jurassic Park would do better to forget genes and build on the technique Mr
Spielberg used for his movie: computer-controlled robotic dinosaurs. Over
the next decade or two, artificial intelligence and bio-materials
engineering will advance to the point at which it would be possible to
create a lifelike Tyrannosaurus rex that behaved with terrifying
unpredictability.
For the palaeogeneticist studying ancient DNA, the ultimate objective is not
to recreate any species - insect or dinosaur. The point is first to track
evolution at the molecular level by following genetic changes over millions
of years. The research may also reveal facts about an extinct creature and
its lifestyle that are impossible to discover from conventional fossils.
Knowledge of a few intact genes from dinosaurs could answer many
controversial questions about their evolution and relationship to today's
reptiles, birds and mammals. And discovering a gene for a digestive enzyme,
for example, would be a strong clue about what a particular dinosaur ate.
Although recreating a whole dinosaur is out of the question, anyone who
isolated an individual gene would find it relatively easy to insert this
into today's living creatures, employing methods already used routinely to
transfer genes between species. Human genes, for instance, have been
inserted into sheep, so that the human proteins required for medical
purposes can be extracted from the animals' milk.
If scientists managed to isolate one dinosaur gene and insert it into a
crocodile embryo, the creature would still grow up looking and behaving like
a croc because its development would be controlled by thousands of its own
genes. But it might produce some dinosaur protein.
An enterprising company could make a fortune breeding and promoting the
resulting crocodiles, even if just a millionth of their genetic material
came from a dinosaur. Imagine Florida restaurants serving crocodine steaks
or Tokyo department stores selling dinocroc shoes and handbags.
Biotechnologists, who are already nervous about the likely impact of
Jurassic Park on public attitudes to genetic engineering, dislike such
speculation. But it is a plausible scenario 20 years from now. Mr
Spielberg's eventuality is unlikely to come to pass for 100 years, if at
all.
