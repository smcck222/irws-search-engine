FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Costly way to cash a cheque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E G LESTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article 'Plan ahead for Holiday Cash' (June 5/6).
Your writer lays insufficient emphasis on the charges that may be levied on
cashing travellers' cheques.
I have very recently returned from Portugal. The banks in Lagos charge
Es2,100 (Pounds 9.00) on any travellers' cheque regardless of value. This,
according to them, is a government instruction. It means, therefore, on a
Pounds 20.00 cheque you get Pounds 11.00 if it is the one cheque. This does
not apply to those with local accounts.
I have received a reply from American Express indicating that its own
branches do not charge. Unfortunately the nearest Amex branch to Lagos is
some 20 miles away.
Tourists to Portugal should beware.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Level playing field for all types of investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J R ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The desirability of a level playing field for all classes of investor
is raised again by the fall of 17p (4 per cent) in the share price of
English China Clays on Wednesday.
In Thursday's financial press this was ascribed to the effect of a
presentation by the company to 50 fund managers on Tuesday night and it is
reasonable to assume that the fall was triggered by action taken as a
consequence of what they were told.
Then yesterday came the announcement by ECC of a rights issue, a proposed
acquisition in the US and a de-merger of its construction materials
business.
Now, ECC may feel that it did its best to make whatever information it
imparted on Tuesday available to a representative audience. However, it was
not generally available to the private investor until 24 hours later, by
which time the bird had flown the coop.
Is there not, please, a clear case for the stock exchange committee to rule
that those privy to such briefings should be debarred from acting on them
until the information has been published in the press? Indeed, this incident
reinforces the stock exchange's own view that information given at such
briefings should be simultaneously channelled through the exchange.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D K WILMOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Barry Riley's article, 'When brass is greener' (June 5). In
the main the investing institutions are not owned by proprietors but in
their turn are run by managers.
Perhaps we can encourage full transparency and accountability in those
organisations. Then the true owners of capital may permit their appointed
managers to wear bowler hats.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Suppliers offer as much real value as customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD GREENSTED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although Messrs Furnham and Pendleton (Management: 'Seduced by the
customer cult', June 7) make some intelligent remarks about the customer
cult, they appear to have forgotten one important company stakeholder, the
supplier. Suppliers invest considerable resources in the continuing good
fortune of their clients, but are rarely treated as key contributors to a
company's success. Exceptions such as British Airways, Marks and Spencer and
the Royal Bank of Scotland are as scarce as they are enlightened.
Suppliers treated as stakeholders will quickly become partners and will add
real value to a company's bottom line.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Big spenders bite the dust: The current fashion for
frugality in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price-cutting is the latest craze to sweep Tokyo, a city of fads and
fashions. The Japanese capital, where oranges often cost more than Pounds 1
each and a plot of land for a small house will cost at least Y20m (Pounds
123,800), has long been one of the most expensive places in the world. But,
temporarily at least, it is becoming a shopper's paradise.
In a land that adores foreign brand names, from Louis Vuitton and Chanel, to
BMW and Dr Marten shoes, consumers are turning away from the designer goods
popular during the late 1980s, when the economy was booming. Instead, they
are going back to basics, influenced by old-fashioned notions like value for
money which suit their straitened circumstances.
Take as an example the elegant avenue of Omote Sando, one of Tokyo's most
fashionable shopping areas, home to the main retail outlets for leading
Japanese clothes designers such as Issey Miyake and Comme des Garcons.
In the past year these shops have become ever more like modern art
galleries, frequented by a tiny group of dedicated collectors. The sales
staff usually outnumber the customers by a factor of two.
In a nearby shop owned by Yohji Yamamoto, another leading designer, a shop
assistant said: 'We have just closed our shop in London because we weren't
selling anything, but frankly we aren't selling anything here either.'
The subdued atmosphere of Omote Sando is a far cry from the scene at the
main outlet of what has become the hottest property in Japanese clothes
retailing, Aoyama. Its shop off Tokyo's main shopping street, the
increasingly tawdry Ginza, is usually crowded with hungry consumers. The
reason: discounts of up to 90 per cent on suits made in China, which are
selling for as little at Y2,500 (Pounds 15), the price of a pair of socks at
Comme des Garcons.
Aoyama, whose discounts have been lauded by government ministers and senior
bureaucrats, is the boldest pace setter in a price-cutting war. Economists
say discounting has become so widespread that the official measure of
inflation - which is based on official list prices - is inaccurate. It shows
inflation running at about 1.6 per cent a year. Once discounting is taken
into account, prices could be falling by about 3 per cent a year, according
to Mr Jesper Koll, economist at S G Warburg, the securities house.
Prices are not being cut across the board. A round-trip ticket for the
three-hour bullet train journey between Tokyo and Kyoto costs about Y28,000,
the price of a cheap return flight to Seoul, the South Korean capital.
But washing machines, for example, are selling on average for 30 per cent
less than their average list price of Y210,000. Toyota Corollas are being
offered at a discount of at least 15 per cent. And a Toyota dealer admitted:
'We can start negotiating after that.'
The recent strength of the yen, which has risen from about Y125 to the
dollar at the turn of the year to about Y106, has exacerbated the price
pressure on some industries by making imports cheaper. Compaq and Dell, the
US personal computer makers, took advantage of the yen's strength and their
cheap manufacturing bases in south-east Asia to launch an assault on the
Japanese personal computer market. Their machines are half the price of
comparable Japanese-made models.
However, price-cutting has failed to reignite consumer spending. Consumer
expenditure rose by 0.9 per cent last year, down from 5.1 per cent in 1988.
The central bank's quarterly report on the economy, published yesterday,
said consumer spending was still sluggish. This is owing to a complex mix of
factors.
The prolonged downturn in Japanese stock and land prices has eaten into
household wealth. In response, households have increased their savings -
from 13.5 per cent of household income in 1990 to about 15.25 per cent this
year - to rebuild their balance sheets. These savings have come from incomes
which are growing more slowly, by 3.2 per cent last year compared with 8.3
per cent in 1990. Consumer caution has been reinforced by job cuts at
Japanese companies.
In the next year consumer spending may start to recover. A rise in share
prices, and signs that the fall in land prices is bottoming out, are making
people feel wealthier, and so more willing to stop saving. Yet even if there
is a revival in spending, it will be modest and differ markedly from the
late 1980s boom.
This is for two main reasons. First, some industries, particularly consumer
electronics, may be facing a more prolonged fall in demand. The Japanese
market for video records, camcorders and audio equipment is saturated. The
main manufacturers, Sony and Matsushita, have failed to come up with new
products to revive demand. In Tokyo's Akihabara district, home to most of
its electronics shops, compact disc players are selling at discounts of up
to 34 per cent.
The second factor is cultural. A shift in values is under way in the wake of
the speculation and conspicuous consumption of the late 1980s. Consumer
goods manufacturers say people want simpler, more functional products, with
the stress on utility rather than design. Department stores such as Tobu are
shifting staff from their deserted jewellery and fine art counters into
departments which sell their own-brand goods, with the stress on value for
money. A recent sales campaign by Isetan, one of the most fashionable
department stores among young people, summed up the mood with the slogan:
Back to Basics.
Indeed, one of the most successful products of the past few months is a book
that captures the mood of the times, the best-selling novel The Noble
Philosophy of Poverty.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Man in the News: White mayor's burdens - Richard Riordan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Riordan, the financier and property developer elected mayor of Los
Angeles this week, has been described as 'LA's version of Ross Perot'. A
multi-millionaire who has never held public office, Riordan spent Dollars 6m
of his personal funds to sell himself to LA voters.
Like Perot, Riordan won votes by promising to apply his business skills to
create jobs and improve the economy. Unlike Perot, however, Riordan must now
move beyond criticising the political establishment and demonstrate his
ability to use his office, rather than his money, to influence events in the
second-largest US city.
His personal wealth of about Dollars 100m has been derived from investment
banking and property after he was left Dollars 80,000 by his father, a New
York Irish immigrant who became a department store president. Riordan was
the youngest of eight children, and graduated from Princeton with a degree
in philosophy and Michigan with a law degree. He moved to LA in 1956 to work
for a law firm.
By 1984 Riordan had formed an investment banking firm with two partners, and
was on the board of Mattel, the toymaker, which faced insolvency when the
video game market crashed. He was a leader of a group of investors which
bailed out the company in a Dollars 200m-plus buy-out. About 800 Mattel
workers in southern California lost their jobs when their factory closed.
Riordan netted an estimated profit of at least Dollars 20m.
The problems he faces as mayor could dwarf his former business challenges.
Next month, he will take over the leadership of a city still scarred by last
year's riots, bristling with racial tensions and struggling to boost its
flagging economy.
Riordan's first priority must be to repair the damage of a bitter and
divisive election campaign. Although he won 56 per cent of the votes cast in
Tuesday's election, his supporters were predominantly white, suburban and
affluent. He won 67 per cent of the white vote, but only 14 per cent of the
black vote, according to a poll by the Los Angeles Times. Among
Asian-Americans, 31 per cent chose Riordan; and 43 per cent of Hispanics
voted for him.
Former business associates disagree that Riordan played on the fears of
white voters, accentuating racial tensions. 'I've known Dick for 20 years,
and he is conservative on some issues but a social liberal on others. He
will represent all the people of Los Angeles,' said Ray Remy, president of
the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.
Riordan pledged on Wednesday to 'unite Los Angeles', but minority groups
remain sceptical. 'I'm not particularly optimistic,' said Dolly Gee,
co-chairman of Asian Pacific Americans for a New LA, a coalition of Asian
community groups. 'Other than his recent attempts to appeal to community
groups, he does not have much of a track record on being involved in the
poorer sections of the community.'
While acknowledging Riordan's philanthropy, Ms Gee said: 'Giving money to
charitable groups is not synonymous with having an understanding of the
problems.' The mayor-elect 'lacks hands-on experience in trying to unite the
divergent interests of different segments of the community'.
However, Riordan has tried to dispel concerns that Los Angeles will be
governed by a 'group of white men in suits'. 'My administration will be made
up of Democrats, Republicans and independents, people of every race, creed,
colour and sexual orientation,' he said.
His first appointment has been to name his business associate and campaign
chairman, William Ward-law, who was also involved in President Bill
Clinton's California campaign, to lead the effort to hire members of the new
city administration. Others who might be involved include a handful of
minority supporters.
In particular, Riordan must reach out to the black community, which solidly
backed his opponent in the mayoral race, Michael Woo, a Chinese-American
liberal.
Riordan's ability to work with state and federal government will be crucial
in his attempts to revive LA's economy. Despite having presented himself as
a 'political outsider' during the campaign, his connections in Sacramento,
the state capital, as well as in Washington, are already evident. On
Thursday, Riordan met California governor Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican.
LA's business community can be relied on to rally round the mayor-elect. 'We
support his efforts to retain jobs, not raise business taxes, and increase
the number of police officers on the street,' said Mr Remy.
Yet even Riordan's supporters question whether his business skills can solve
LA's problems. Mr Remy notes: 'It is one thing to negotiate to buy a
building or a parcel of land and quite another to deal with the intricacies
of city, state and federal politics. That can be very frustrating.'
Nor does the business community wholeheartedly support one of the main
planks of Riordan's election campaign - a plan to privatise such city
services as rubbish collection and to lease the Los Angeles International
airport to private operators to raise funds to pay for 3,000 extra police
officers.
It already appears that Riordan may have to find other ways to fulfil his
campaign promise to expand the police force, thus reducing crime and
attracting business. Raising taxes might not be the answer, as this could
alienate important Republican supporters.
The question is whether Riordan, the businessman, can become Mayor Riordan,
the political consensus builder. 'Dick has not been outside the political
process, he has been a close observer through his many dealings with the
city,' says Mr Remy.
Indeed some regard him as the 'consummate insider'. 'He is a political power
broker who has exerted his influence through political contributions,' says
Ms Gee.
As mayor, Riordan will have a forum but few funds. His immediate problem
will be to attract state and federal money to resolve the city's looming
Dollars 500m budget deficit. He will be judged, however, on his ability to
win the support of those who either didn't vote for him, or didn't vote at
all.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Muck, brass and plain talking: Kenneth Clarke must back up
tough words with decisive action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have a politician at the Treasury. Emerging this week from the briefest
of silences after his elevation to the chancellorship, Mr Kenneth Clarke had
a simple message for those seeking to second-guess his economic strategy:
they should look at where he came from.
For those unfamiliar with his background, he filled in the details. His
convictions and opinions had been shaped in Nottingham - a place where
people got their hands dirty, where the priority was to get a job, to earn a
living. And the new chancellor had not torn up his roots: 'I hardly know the
City . . . I only come to London because I have to come here to do the
particular work I have to do.'
Unintentionally, Mr Clarke told us something else. As his demoralised
backbench colleagues roared with approval during his first House of Commons
performance as chancellor, he confirmed his status as the most powerful
force in the cabinet. Mr John Major has pinned on his new chancellor his
remaining hopes of survival in 10 Downing Street. But Mr Clarke has been
annointed heir apparent, should the Conservative party fail to recover its
collective nerve. His first outing as chancellor could not have been more
successful. At lunchtime on Wednesday he charmed the parliamentary press
gallery with his witty but serious insight into the politics which will
drive his economics. By 9.30 that night he was restoring hope to the Tory
MPs who had been left stunned by Mr Lamont's blistering attack on the prime
minister.
Those waiting for what he termed the 'odd quip about the monetary
aggregates' had to be satisfied with an assurance that as a former lawyer Mr
Clarke had 'handled money'. He also had friends who worked in the City. He
was 'not bad' on the geography of the Square Mile.
There was, however, a short, sharp description of the framework in which his
economic strategy would be shaped. Introducing a new label into the
political vocabulary, he put himself in the 'hard centre' of Conservatism -
pro-Europe, pro-free market economics and pro-enlightened social reform.
Combine that with his personal background and it produced a chancellor who
was committed to industrial and economic expansion, and to providing
opportunities for people to improve their living standards. After all, as he
put it, 'that's the point of the whole thing - growth and employment'.
But for so consummate a politician as Mr Clarke, this week was the easy
part. Anyone can change the rhetoric of policymaking. There are many in the
Treasury who have been worried for some time that the uncompromising
language in which the government has framed its anti-inflation commitment
had begun to distort the basic objective of economic policy.
Mr Clarke has restored the balance, reminding people that the containment of
inflation and a modicum of fiscal prudence are means to an end rather than
ends in themselves.
But the chancellor - who next week will follow his message to the
politicians with his first attempt to win the confidence of the financiers -
faces hard decisions. His inheritance does not live up to the unalloyed
optimism of his predecessor.
True, Britain is one of few western industrial economies showing real signs
of growth. The headline inflation figure is the lowest for 30 years. A sharp
fall in wage settlements and depressed international prices are reassuring.
So there is little debate in the Treasury about the stance of monetary
policy. Some believe that interest rates at 6 per cent are fractionally too
high; others might like to see them move up slightly. Any argument though is
at the margin.
But the recovery is still fragile, vulnerable to the slide into recession of
most of Britain's principal export markets. Inflation will soon begin to
creep up in response to the delayed impact of devaluation.
And then there is the 'iceberg' - Mr Clarke's word - upon which it might all
founder: a Pounds 1bn a week borrowing requirement equivalent to 8 per cent
of national income.
Those who have spoken to the chancellor about his priorities since his
appointment detect no great difference with Mr Lamont in the substance of
his attitude to inflation.
His presentation is different - relative price stability is a necessary but
not a sufficient condition for economic growth. But there has been no hint
that he wants to relax the aim of monetary policy. In next week's speech at
the Mansion House he will reaffirm the 1 to 4 per cent inflation target set
after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. As Mr Clarke
commented: 'I have no intention of putting a sponge right across Norman
Lamont's economic slate'.
But his approach to the public borrowing requirement is more opaque. He said
several things this week.
The first was that the deficit must be reduced if recovery was to be
sustained. The second, that in sticking to the Treasury's spending targets,
he had no interest in dismantling the welfare state - suggestions of hotel
charges in hospitals and prescription charges for the elderly were given
short shrift. The third was that his political instincts did not incline him
 -as some reports had suggested - towards increasing income tax in his
November budget.
On one level he was simply recognising political realities. The more
draconian proposals thrown up by the Treasury's review of welfare spending
would never muster a majority in the House of Commons. Why not discount them
now? Nor in the present state of the Tory party is it sensible to start
talking even about the possibility of raising income tax.
But observers both inside and outside government were left wondering how, if
spending was not to be cut and taxes raised no further, Mr Clarke planned to
square the circle. (One of the striking things about the new chancellor is
that he tends to say the same things in public as in private).
There was one clue to his thinking. In his references to the cause of the
deficit Mr Clarke suggested that the causes were 'mostly' cyclical. The
implication is that a resumption of growth will solve most of the problem.
Restraining increases in public spending to below the rate of growth of the
economy - and the delayed tax increases already announced by Mr Lamont could
deal with the remainder over time.
It is a plausible strategy, but one fraught with risk. Nobody in the
Treasury is sure just how much of the deficit can be attributed to the
recession. No one can confidently predict the lags between the economic
upswing and a commensurate adjustment in revenues and expenditure.
It may be that the uncertainties will demand a political as much as an
economic judgment. All the choices - cutting rather than containing
spending, raising taxes, and waiting for economic recovery - pose a
formidable test of nerve. A mistake might well be fatal.
In two weeks at the Treasury Mr Clarke has exhibited effortlessly all of the
political skills his predecessor lacked. He is confident, combative.
He might yet spend as short a period in his present office as did Mr Major.
But the politician at the Treasury will soon have to follow words with
actions. It takes more than an empathy with the real world of the industrial
Midlands to run the economy.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Hard choices for Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTERITY WILL judge Mr Lamont more kindly than did Sir Norman Fowler. It
could hardly do otherwise. The question that matters, however, is how it
will judge his bouncy, bluff successor, who announced only this week his
desire to strengthen the 'real economy'. Will he be judged 'brilliant' three
years from now, to be denigrated subsequently as another in a lengthy line
of 'dash for growth' Tory chancellors?
British postwar chancellors of the exchequer are either unpopular in office,
because they have to clear up the mess made by their predecessor; or they
are unpopular after leaving office, because they made the mess their
predecessors must clear up. Mr Lamont can comfort himself with the thought
that he is in the first category.
He is so doubly. The ex-chancellor's predecessor but one, Nigel Lawson,
presided over the economic expansion of the latter part of the 1980s. The
ex-chancellor's immediate predecessor, John Major, decided to put sterling
into the ERM at a central rate of DM2.95. The first bequest led to the
subsequent recession. The second blocked off the escape route when it was
desperately needed. Mr Lamont could do little but cope with the inevitable
unpopularity. He was hapless rather than tragic, but hapless he certainly
was.
Despite the limited room for manoeuvre he enjoyed, Mr Lamont was even
something of a reformer, notably over fiscal procedures. He will be
remembered for the new top-down approach to the control of public spending;
for the multi-stage Budget introduced in March; and for the unified Budget,
first due in November this year. He will be noted also for designing a
post-ERM framework for consolidating low inflation, which includes the 1-4
per cent inflation target, the monthly monetary report and the Bank of
England's inflation report.
Specious arguments
Mr Clarke does, in short, inherit much of value from his now universally
denigrated predecessor. It includes an opportunity for sustained growth.
Unfortunately, his temptation will be to throw it away. If Mr Clarke is to
recognise the dangers he faces and the opportunities he enjoys, he must
first see through some of the specious arguments he is being offered.
Some of those who blame the ERM for everything wrong with the economy fail
to admit they have really been against the costs of lowering inflation. Some
of those who say that monetary and fiscal policies must be targeted at real
economic growth fail to say that they do not care about higher inflation.
The first group was against lowering inflation. The second is against
keeping it low. Neither approach is acceptable.
The warning was properly given by Mr Eddie George, the next governor of the
Bank of England, on the very day that Mr Lamont fired his missile at the
occupants of the front benches. Sound money, said Mr George, 'is about jobs
and investment; it is about living . . . standards; it is not just the
abstract ideal of a crusty, academic profession'.
Headless chickens
Stopping inflation is painful. It is painful for those who bought houses in
the belief that prices could only go up. It is painful for property
investors. It is painful for the banks. It is painful for those who lose
their jobs. To have paid so much for lower inflation was quite bad enough.
To have to undergo the agony once more would be unforgiveable.
It is hard to be optimistic, however, since success depends on the judgment
of politicians subjected to the panics of a few hundred headless chickens
behind them and the often unrealistic expectations of the millions of their
masters in front. Policymaking is also going to be exceptionally difficult.
The debt-encumbered recovery now under way has no postwar precedent.
Experience elsewhere suggests further cuts in interest rates may well be
needed. But how far can interest rates be cut and how much should fiscal
policy be tightened to compensate?
Nothing will be more difficult than the fiscal policy decisions. The least
the chancellor can do is keep to existing spending targets. These are tight,
allowing an increase of only about 2 per cent in real terms between this
year and 1995-96. They will not be achieved without making tough decisions
even in sensitive areas. So what does Mr Clarke mean when he says he did not
come into politics to dismantle the welfare state? Is invalidity benefit
sacrosanct? What about mortgage interest relief and other perks for the
middle classes? And why is income tax to be left out of the fiscal equation?
If the budget deficit needs to be tackled, those who earn most will have to
contribute too.
What Mr Clarke intended when he set sustained recovery as his aim will be
shown by how he makes such choices. At each point, there will be both more
prudent and riskier options. At each point, arguments will be made in either
direction. A disastrous chancellorship is one in which every decision is
taken in the riskier direction. Recovery will come. Mr Clarke must persuade
his party to allow him to err towards caution.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Still on an even keel: The City's reaction to the new
chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mud and vitriol flying around Westminster this week have failed to upset
the City of London. Whatever the criticisms of John Major and his government
by Norman Lamont, sterling has stayed steady and the stock market has edged
up.
For all the confusion over the policies of the new chancellor, Kenneth
Clarke, who at times this week has seemed on the brink of a dangerous policy
of dashing for growth, long-dated gilt-edged yields have been edging lower,
perhaps implying growing confidence on the part of investors.
Alternatively, UK government bonds may simply have been moving in line with
a firmer trend across Europe, and ignoring local upsets. 'People aren't sure
whether this week's events matter. The UK government has long been perceived
as being quite weak,' says Michael Saunders of Salomon Bros.
A minor flurry of speculation over interest rates has subsided. 'Lamont's
remarks will make it more difficult for Clarke to cut interest rates,' says
Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Bank. He argues that a rate change
would now have to be solidly justified by economic evidence - for instance,
slow monetary growth and a faltering recovery - rather than by political
convenience (which Lamont implied had motivated the last cut on January 26).
David Shaw, who heads investment strategy at one of the biggest life
assurance groups, Legal &amp; General, says the key decisions may not be made
until the autumn. 'We are worried that the emphasis will be on public
spending cuts rather than tax increases,' he says. In the meantime, however,
'nothing much will change for several months'. The City expects a quiet
period while Clarke masters his brief. So although he is about to make a big
speech at the Lord Mayor's Guildhall dinner on Tuesday, an event at which
the chancellor normally discusses the technicalities of funding policy and
monetary strategy, tension is low.
'I don't think it is realistic to expect anything very new,' says Kevin
Adams, UK bond strategist at the leading government bond house, Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
Despite all the initial speculation that Clarke might overthrow the
discredited Treasury advisers and strike out afresh, beginning with cuts in
short-term interest rates, the markets have quickly come to a more
conservative judgment. Since Clarke was appointed on May 27, short-term
sterling interest rates have tracked sideways and, although the sterling
exchange rate index initially eased a little, this week it has been
rallying.
Demand for sterling bonds has also picked up. 'Gilts have ignored everything
this week,' comments Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Capital
Markets. 'The government is pretty well hemmed in. It's less likely now that
we will have an interest rate cut.'
Investors elsewhere in Europe are now being attracted into sterling bonds by
high interest rate differentials. Not only are they buying gilts, but some
hefty corporate bond issues, including Pounds 250m from British Gas and
Pounds 150m from Marks and Spencer, have been mopped up within the past few
days.
'The Germans are becoming quite enthusiastic about gilts,' notes Stephen
Lewis of London Bond Broking. The markets, he says, have been comforted by
the warnings of Eddie George, who becomes governor of the Bank of England
next month, that interest rates should not be cut at present.
Mr Lewis comments that the City was not sorry to see Lamont go. Clarke, as
he juggles growth rates against interest rates and fiscal deficits, is for
now in a position to be 'all things to all men'.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Extract from Lamont letter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following is an extract from a letter marked 'confidential'. It was
written by Mr Norman Lamont while he was minister of state for defence
procurement to Timothy Renton, minister of state at the Foreign Office, on
February 23 1986.
'. . . We need to be able to answer any criticism that the participation of
this wholly-owned government organisation is improving the Iraqi capability
to attack shipping in the Gulf . . .
'The remaining IMS responsibilities in this contract are supervisory and
relate to the construction of the building and the installation of the
safety and general monitoring equipment which has already been delivered . .
. all this equipment is directed exclusively to the physical safety of those
who conduct the tests and the weapons . . .
'The discreet test equipment for the weapons will be supplied and installed
(after IMS has left the site) by French contractors . . .
'These contractors are already engaged in the testing of the missiles . . .
Therefore the nature of the IMS work involved and the fact that the missiles
are already being monitored and tested in temporary facilities convincingly
demonstrates that the IMS work cannot be interpreted as a real enhancement
of Iraqi war effort . . .'

FT  12 JUN 93 / Major warns of tough spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR urged Tories yesterday to face up to the prospect of tough
public spending curbs and said the Conservatives' priority should be to
listen to 'the heartbeat of Britain'.
The prime minister told the Welsh Conservative conference that all public
spending had to be reviewed because 'we are not prepared to see an
ever-increasing tax burden' or to 'mortgage our children's future' through
massive public borrowing. But he said many proposals for saving money might
be discarded once examined.
He said Tories had to go 'into the living-room of the three-bed
semi-detached house' to 'understand what it is that people actually want. It
is the answers to these questions which determine where the heartbeat of
Britain lies'.
Firstly people wanted jobs, 'to provide for their families and themselves'.
People wanted medical care and financial support in their old age.
He said he also wanted to encourage home ownership.
He implicitly admitted to a failure of leadership - but not just by him -
saying: 'It is when those fundamental securities seem uprooted that most
people feel most threatened. And that, right the way across Europe from one
end to the other, that's what has happened in recent years.'
After a traumatic week he decided to abandon his prepared speech and speak
from notes, to try to recapture the success of his 'soap box' performances
during the general election campaign.
He spent much of his speech defending Mr John Patten, the education
secretary. He said too many children were failing at school on basic skills.
What could they do? 'They cannot all be prime minister.'
But the first priority of his speech was to convince Tory supporters that
the government had a sense of direction. His self-deprecating jokes and
unassuming delivery went down well with delegates in rain-drenched
Llangollen.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Company 'equipped Iraq testing complex'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT-owned defence company equipped an Iraqi complex which could
have been used for testing missiles, including Exocets, after ministers
justified the contract, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
Previously classified Whitehall documents read out by the inquiry's counsel
Miss Priscilla Baxendale QC show that ministers approved the contract
involving International Military Services after ignoring warnings from
Foreign Office officials that the complex had a potentially lethal military
use.
The final go-ahead for the project was given after Mr Norman Lamont, towards
the end of his period as minister for defence procurement, had insisted that
the contract did not significantly enhance Iraq's military capability. It
was also argued at ministerial level that the contract was not subject to
the guidelines as it had been signed before they were introduced.
The documents also show that ministers decided that the completion of the
IMS contract in 1986 should be kept secret.
The existence of the IMS project surfaced in a report published by the
Financial Times in July 1991. Both the MoD and IMS refused to comment at the
time.
Further details of the project emerged yesterday during oral evidence given
to the Scott inquiry by Mr Alan Collins, a senior Foreign Office official.
He was chairman of the interdepartmental government committee in charge of
vetting sensitive defence-related contracts to Iraq and Iran in the 1980s.
Mr Collins told the inquiry that the contract for construction of a concrete
bunker and installation of safety and monitoring equipment had first been
negotiated with the Iraqis in 1981 when the government had agreed fully to
guarantee it financially in the event of non-performance.
But the subject of its completion became embroiled in an inter-departmental
controversy after Mr Collins and Mr Richard Luce, then minister of state at
the Foreign Office, had argued with defence officials that it ran contrary
to the guidelines restricting defence exports to Iraq announced to
parliament in October 1985.
In a minute dated August 30 1985, apparently based on intelligence
information, Mr Collins wrote: 'We need to keep a close eye on this project
. . . it could be used to support Exocet missiles.'
Asked by Lord Justice Scott whether he thought it was unsuitable for a
government-owned company to be involved in such a project, Mr Collins
replied: 'We felt it should be debated and we wanted to be assured at the
highest level that it fell within the guidelines.'
Under the guidelines announced to parliament by the then foreign secretary
Sir Geoffery Howe, no defence equipment should be exported to Iraq or Iran
that would significantly 'enhance the capability of either side to prolong
or exacerbate' the conflict between the two countries.
A high-level source close to the Scott inquiry said after yesterday's
hearing that evidence given during the periodic oral hearings so far was
only the 'tip of the iceberg' of what is being gathered from a mass of
previously classified documentation and written evidence.
The oral hearings will continue next Tuesday with evidence by Sir Stephen
Egerton, the former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Mr William
Waldegrave, a cabinet member and Foreign Office minister, is expected to be
called as witness before the summer recess.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Names to fight EGM restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPAIGNERS acting on behalf of loss-making Lloyd's Names are seeking to
overturn a rule change imposing new restrictions on the ability of Names -
individuals whose assets support the market - to call extraordinary general
meetings.
Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, has said he will
seek to overturn a rule change at Lloyd's under section 6(4a) of the 1982
Lloyd's Act. The act says that the market must submit a byelaw, amendment or
revocation to a general meeting of the society if requested to do so by 500
Names.
Mr Astor's goal of calling an extraordinary general meeting to liquidate
Lloyd's was made more difficult this week when Lloyd's raised the minimum
number of Names' signatures needed for an extraordinary general meeting from
100 to 1,500.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that managers of a number of syndicates at the
Lloyd's insurance market are taking issue with proposals in the Lloyd's
business plan to limit the commission income paid by Names to their managing
agents.
The plan, published by Lloyd's in April, ordered an immediate cut in
managing agency fees to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of capacity (the amount of
premium income syndicates are allowed to underwrite) in 1994 and 0.4 per
cent of capacity in 1995.
The business plan also said that managing agencies would not be allowed to
distribute any profits earned on fees, but would be obliged to retain them
within the agency.
Charman Underwriting Agency, which manages marine syndicate 488, and the
managers of several other syndicates which have charged higher fees, have
'given notice' to members' agencies that they are reviewing their fee
structure.
It is understood that some of the managing agencies are unhappy about the
the new rules and may even leave the market unless changes are made.
Some agencies face a drop in income of as much as 70 per cent because of the
change. One agent protested that the business plan was too proscriptive and
that there had been insufficient consultation with businesses at Lloyd's.
Members' agencies yesterday played down the importance of the moves. 'We
regard it as purely precautionary,' said the chairman of one of the largest
Lloyd's members' agencies. 'We believe these syndicates will continue
underwriting next year.'

NALGO, the public service union, yesterday signed an agreement with Reed
Care, a large employment agency, which will encourage union membership among
temporary social workers.
Under the one-year agreement Reed Care will urge its temporary workers to
join Nalgo and the union will recommend the agency to local authorities.
The deal appears to check the trend towards the greater use of non-union
temporary workers.
Reed Care has pledged not to supply temporary care staff as replacements for
workers involved in a strike. It will also advise its temporary workers not

The poll, in today's Daily Mail, finds that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade

FT  12 JUN 93 / Move to reopen talks on Pool Re
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS moved yesterday to reopen negotiations with the government over
Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company which covers business
against losses from terrorist attack, Richard Lapper writes.
On Wednesday Mr Ian Rushton, outgoing chairman of the Association of British
Insurers, said member companies were reviewing their participation of the
scheme, set up earlier this year after terrorism cover was withdrawn from
commercial insurance policies.
Mr Alan Bridgewater, who takes over as association chairman next month, said
he was concerned 'to engage in a constructive discussion with the DTI to
review the whole scheme as quickly as possible'.
Mr Bridgewater, however, said he 'felt strongly concerned' about the lack of
consultation by the DTI on the issue.
The row between insurers and the government follows protests earlier this
week from the Confederation of British Industry and other business
organisations about planned increases in premium rates at Pool Re.
Rates for some of the largest buildings in most-exposed areas, such as
central London, will rise more than 300 per cent next month. Businesses in
less vulnerable parts of the country will benefit from rate reductions,
however.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Labour alleges move to cut benefits by Pounds 5bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans social security savings of about Pounds 5bn a year by
the end of the century in order to stabilise the sector's proportion of
public spending, Labour said yesterday.
A second batch of documents, said to be from within the Department of Social
Security, came to light a day after the Tories faced a damaging row provoked
by the leaking of plans to cut substantially the cost of invalidity benefit.
The proposals were to tax it, make it less generous and focus it more on the
long-term sick.
While ministers dismissed Labour's attack as further scaremongering, Tory
backbenchers still appear uneasy about the prospect of further months of
speculation and reports about public spending cuts in the approach to the
unified Budget in November.
The papers released by Labour spokesmen set out some broader points about
the future of contributory benefits and also implied that other benefits
would have to be cut.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said that the saving of Pounds 5bn a
year by the end of the century envisaged in the papers was almost four times
the Pounds 1.3bn saving from changes to invalidity benefit alone.
But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, denied that the
long-term review of his department's Pounds 80bn spending was Treasury-led.
He said it was intended instead 'to make sure vulnerable people are
protected, and to make sure the whole system is sustainable and does not
outstrip the growth of the nation's ability to pay for it'.
He insisted that there was no question of taking money away from people who
were genuinely sick and in need, but said that there was a need to look at
why the number of people claiming invalidity benefit had been rising so
quickly and why people had been remain-ing on the benefit for longer.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, highlighted the
paper's admission that introducing means-testing for invalidity benefit
would be such a fundamental change that it could lead to assumptions that a
similar approach would be extended to other contributory benefits.
The move would undermine the principles of the welfare state, he said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Steep invalidity payments rise triggers off scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE public spending has increased by half in the past five years,
invalidity benefits have doubled.
That gives ministers good reason to examine this area of social security as
part of the effort to tackle the fiscal deficit - likely to be Pounds 50bn
this financial year - without further increases in taxation.
In 1992-93 invalidity benefits cost the taxpayer Pounds 6.1bn out of social
security spending of Pounds 79.2bn. Five years earlier invalidity payments
came to Pounds 3bn compared with total outlays on social security of Pounds
48.9bn. Invalidity benefits now account for nearly 8 per cent of the cost of
social security, up from 6 per cent in 1987-88.
The number of people receiving these allowances have increased from 1m five
years ago to 1.5m last year. On the basis of the most recent Department of
Social Security forecasts, the numbers will reach 1.77m by 1995-96.
For all the obvious political risks involved, the idea of cutting these
payments has some practical advantages. Invalidity benefits add up to one of
the larger areas of social security spending, which accounts for almost a
third of total government spending.
Efforts to reduce state pensions - responsible for nearly half the social
security bill - or child benefits would provoke outcries from a wide
cross-section of society. Targeting invalidity benefits may be less
politically risky.
There are three main ways to cut the benefits: make them taxable, crack down
on the criteria used when handing them out or cut them.
The benefits are typically paid to men in their 50s who have lost their jobs
and are seen by social security officials as unfit for work. While a person
on unemployment benefit gets about Pounds 45 a week, if he or she can be
categorised as unfit for work the sum goes up to Pounds 56. An extra Pounds
12 allowance is available if the man or woman is under 40.
Evidence weighed up includes a written assessment from the individual's
doctor and, significantly, the likelihood of employers hiring them.
During the recession, which has been accompanied by a steep rise in
unemployment, individuals with even mild disabilities have been less likely
to get jobs. That has been both because of the large numbers of able-bodied
people on the jobs market and because employers struggling to cut costs are
less prone to make allowances for people capable of working anything less
than flat-out.
In the 1980s a person on invalidity benefit might after a year or two have
been able to find a job and leave the social security register. In recent
years this has been far more difficult.
Ministers suspect that doctors find it hard to resist pleas to certify
patients as unfit to work. They are considering a more rigorous medical test
to target the benefit on the genuine sick and disabled.
A second reason why the numbers of people on these allowances has risen is
probably because they pay more than unemployment benefits.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Smith to step up search for common ground: The opposition
leader's uphill struggle for one-member-one-vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS not been a bad week for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, whose
Commons performance on Wednesday raised the flagging morale of his party and
increased the government's discomfiture.
But earlier in the week the three seaside union conferences which rejected
the Smith plan for reforming the party's links with the unions were a rude
reminder that his leadership still faces a critical summer-time test.
The Smith camp, and other supporters of one-member-one-vote, are adamant
that they can prevail in spite of the clear majority of votes at this year's
Labour conference that will be committed against removing the unions from
selection of political candidates.
Mr Smith is said to be determined to have his way and, according to one
official, is 'spitting blood' about the role of Mr John Edmonds, the general
secretary of the GMB, in blocking his plans.
If he could yet win he could boost his national leadership rating, much as
Hugh Gaitskell boosted his in the 1950s by taking on the unions and the
left. If he loses, some opponents and supporters believe it could be a fatal
blow to his leadership.
One sympathetic union official said: 'Having put the issue of union power
into the limelight he cannot afford to lose. If he does lose he will not be
able to say anything without being accused of being the mouthpiece of
producer interests.'
Over the weeks leading up to the September conference the possible
compromises will no doubt be closely examined, and the committee which has
examined Labour-union links may be recovened to try to find one.
The trouble is that compromise between the two positions now staked out is
hard to find. In order to repair some of the damage to union pride created
by the anti-union tone of the debate in the immediate aftermath of election
defeat, supporters of reform will emphasise how much they broadly approve of
the union role in the Labour party and stress the plan to offer cut-price
membership to union members.
There is no obvious half-way house between one-member-one-vote and voting as
a union member. GMB and Nupe officials say that political levy-payers who
sign a Labour supporters register would be voting as associate members of
the Labour party rather than just union members, and that the register is
thus an acceptable compromise. But such a deal would be seen not as a
compromise but as a victory for the union barons.
The only realistic way out would be to postpone the issue for another year -
but that merely leaves the problem unresolved and open to exploitation by
political enemies.
So how is Mr Smith going to win? Some supporters say that when the union
leaders see how serious he is they will change their minds, or at least
abstain, at the party conference and thus let one-member-one-vote prevail.
Others suggest that although there might be a clear majority against the
Smith position it will not unite around any alternative. The TGWU general
union made this outcome more likely yesterday by deciding not just against
the Smith position but also the GMB-Nupe register.
A new system has to be established because the old one has been abolished.
An impasse might give Mr Smith the opportunity to impose his own solution by
default.
According to some of his supporters he could make this a 'back me or sack
me' issue. But would he do it?
He is known more for conciliation than confrontation, and in spite of his
attachment to the principle of one-member-one-vote he has never seemed
convinced that a significant distancing from the trade unions is a necessary
condition of a Labour victory.
This could become as much a question of face as of principle for Mr Smith.

council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of electoral reform in the Labour party yesterday won the support
of the executive council of Britain's biggest union, the TGWU, which agreed
to support change to the existing electoral system. The decision to support
change was made after a consultation process in the union. It did not
specify which alternative voting system it favoured. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU
general secretary, also announced that tentative merger talks with the
building union Ucatt had started. He said there was a clear logic to a
merger as Ucatt and the TGWU were the two biggest unions in the industry.

FT  12 JUN 93 / School ski trips wreck Abta's insurance hopes: Steep claims
mean that Pounds 1 of premium buys only Pounds 1 of cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST FEBRUARY Mr Larry Cahn, head of careers at Alderbrook School in
Solihull, West Midlands, received a call telling him the ski company to
which he had paid Pounds 18,000 of parents' money had collapsed.
With 48 pupils due to leave for Austria in two weeks, the news came as a
shock, particularly as he had happily dealt before with the company, Travels
by Design. The caller, from another ski company called ESL Holidays, told Mr
Cahn not to worry. ESL would ensure the trip went ahead. It did, without the
school having to pay any additional money. Last month ESL collapsed.
The Association of British Travel Agents says school ski trip failures
threaten its future. Claims on Abta's shortfall insurance have been so high
that the association has to pay Pounds 1 of premium for each Pounds 1 of
cover. Premium contributions from members are expected to be seven or eight
times as high as last year.
Like Mr Cahn, most teachers and parents emerge from ski company failures
unscathed. Provided the company is one of its members Abta picks up the tab,
ensuring trips go ahead.
What worries Abta is the ease with which the customer lists of failed
companies are sold to other operators. Schools are usually asked to assign
their bookings to the acquiring operators, which claim the failed companies'
refunds directly from Abta.
Schools are happy that their trips are going ahead. The acquiring operators
use the Abta money to pay other creditors, such as hotels and coach
companies.
The losers are Abta, its remaining member companies, and ultimately -
through the weakening of the association - the travelling public.
Last April Abta wrote to schools and education authorities saying open-ended
compensation could not continue. Deposits would be refunded only if paid
less than a year in advance and only up to Pounds 25 per person. Other
payments would not be returned if paid more than 10 weeks before departure.
Ski operators reacted furiously, saying the letters would damage their
business. This week six operators obtained an injunction suspending Abta's
threat.
Undercapitalised companies have long been attracted to the travel industry -
encouraged by the low barriers of entry into the market and by the ease with
which business can expand. The ski tour market, in which schools are
prepared to pay deposits a year or more in advance, has been particularly
enticing. Mr John Shepherd, managing director of Equity, one of the ski
companies that took Abta to court, said: 'Expansion in the travel business
is quite simple. All you do is contract for more beds. You don't have to buy
any new plant and tool up for the next 15 years.'
Mr Cahn says his school receives brochures every year from up to 40
operators. He constantly gets telephone calls from ski companies wanting to
make appointments to visit the school.
Abta said in an affidavit to the court that school trip operators 'are
particularly open to exploitation by the more opportunistic and even
fraudulent members of the industry'.
There have been instances of the company that acquires a client list having
close links with the failed organisation, although that does not appear to
have been the case with Travels by Design and ESL. Abta has expressed
concern about acquiring companies' practice of employing executives of
failed groups as consultants.
The association has not yet decided whether to appeal against the
injunction, or whether to fight its case when a full hearing takes place at
the end of the year. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's chief executive, conceded
that the association would have to examine other ways of protecting its
finances.
But he insisted that the threat to the association should not be
underestimated. Abta tour operators have to arrange bonds, usually
equivalent to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of turnover. If the bonds
prove insufficient to compensate customers, the association draws on its
shortfall insurance.
In the year to the end of last month, five school tour operator failures
resulted in claims of Pounds 4.2m, of which the companies' bonds covered
only Pounds 1.8m. The remaining Pounds 2.4m had to be met from the shortfall
insurance, representing 85 per cent of claims on the fund.
Mr Dunscombe said: 'The insurers, to some extent understandably, have said
that this is not insurance. Insurance is meant to cover unlikely events.'
Abta will have to pay Pounds 3m in premiums this year to get Pounds 3m of
shortfall insurance.
Abta has been driven to the point of financial collapse before. In 1991 ski
company failures exhausted its shortfall insurance. The association had to
impose an emergency levy on its tour operator members to ensure its
survival.
Mr Dunscombe doubted that Abta members would agree to pay another emergency
levy if the shortfall insurance was exhausted again. The association is
divided about its future, with the larger companies threatening to leave
unless the cost of running Abta is cut. The imposition of a levy could lead
to the large groups deciding that association membership is no longer worth
the trouble.
Abta will have to find other ways of reducing school operator failures.
Mr Andrew Lay, commercial director of Skibound, the market leader, said Abta
should rely on large operators to warn it of companies in trouble. He said
his company had told Abta of holidays on which rivals undercut it by Pounds
20 even though the margin made by Skibound itself was only Pounds 5.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Tec launches fund for venture capital: Pounds 5m will be
available for equity stakes in companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Northumberland Training and Enterprise Council yesterday became the
first Tec to set up its own venture capital fund, allowing it to make equity
investments in companies in its area.
The Pounds 5m Oak Fund is part of a package of services launched by the Tec
yesterday to stimulate enterprise in Northumberland.
The package includes a Pounds 300,000 loan fund, the Rowan Fund, jointly
financed by the Tec and Midland Bank, offering unsecured loans of up to
Pounds 20,000 with interest pegged at half base rate for new businesses and
base rate for existing companies.
Northumberland Tec chief executive Mr Stephen Cowell said he believed the
enterprise and training remits of Tecs, the 82 employer-led bodies which
deliver government training schemes in England and Wales, were of equal
value and went hand in hand.
Tecs, he told an audience of Northumberland business leaders, are not
'eggtimers' through which government grants pass, but enterprising bodies
which should recognise the need to take risks.
The venture capital fund, he said after the launch, did not duplicate
resources available from the private sector but was a response to complaints
from Northumberland companies about the difficulty of securing equity
finance below Pounds 250,000.
Mr Cowell said: 'The enterprise strategy was set up to create a whole series
of products outside our contract with the government. We're seeking to put
our resources together with existing providers so that they might be willing
to take risks they wouldn't otherwise have done.'
Outside consultants will guide the Oak Fund's investment decisions. It aims
to take a stake, typically of about Pounds 100,000, in viable businesses for
five to seven years.
Other elements of the Tec package are the Cedar Fund, a Pounds 300,000 fund
jointly financed by British Coal Enterprise, offering loans of up to Pounds
50,000 at 9 per cent fixed interest, and a Training Investment Fund, through
which the Tec will offer companies interest-free loans of up to Pounds
20,000 for high-quality training.
Northumberland Tec is already involved in a Pounds 10m scheme to convert
Longhirst, a country mansion, into a conference centre and a campus for the
University of Northumbria.

MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, said in Dublin yesterday he fully
supported efforts by the UK and Irish governments to restart round-table
talks on Northern Ireland.
He said the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement and reunification of Ireland by
consent remained the central pillars of his party's policy on the province.
Mr Smith is on a two-day visit to the republic, accompanied by Mr Kevin
McNamara, Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland.
Mr Smith said that any renewed political talks in the north 'should be on
the basis of the three strands of the previous talks, and on the principle
that nothing should be agreed until all is agreed'.
He rejected a suggestion made in the Commons this week by Sir Edward Heath,
a former Conservative prime minister, that the talks should be held without
the participation of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), led by
the Rev Ian Paisley. He is now viewed as the main obstacle to the talks'
resumption because of his insistence that the republic must drop its
territorial claim to the province.
Mr Smith said: 'The DUP won 17 per cent of the vote in the recent local
elections and that has to be accepted as a reality.'
He said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, could also be accepted
into the talks process, 'but they must first renounce violence'. Labour
'would not want to have any talks with Sinn Fein'.
But Mr Smith respected the recent moves by Mr John Hume, the leader of the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland, to hold
a series of discussions with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to find a
way of bringing an end to the IRA violence.
Mr Smith said this 'took a great deal of personal courage and bravery'.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Change on audit fee disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is proposing to amend the legislation
governing disclosure of fees generated by auditors in companies' annual
accounts.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, said he wanted to remove
the requirement for disclosure of associates of auditors where the auditors'
only relationship to the associates is as insolvency practitioner.
But this includes many companies which are classified as associates only
because an insolvency partner in a firm of auditors has been appointed to it
and has control of at least 20 per cent of the voting rights.
The existing regulations came into force in October 1991 following
consultation designed to deal with potential conflicts of interest.
Comments on the DTI consultative paper are invited by July 30.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MINERS AT the Betws coal mine in south Wales have voted to abandon their bid
to run the pit. They now support a management buy-out team of four pit
executives.
Betws, in Dyfed, is one of 20 pits that British Coal is inviting the private
sector to operate, having decided that they have no long-term future under
its ownership.
Mr Martin Cook, the Betws deputy manager heading the bid, will outline the
buy-out proposal to Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, at a private meeting
in London next week.
Mr Cook said: 'The beauty of our scheme is that the colliery will remain in
local hands, worked by local people. We are not in it to make a quick profit
and then pull out as, we suspect, other independents might favour.'
Mr Cook's team plans to extend the Betws colliery's life for up to 10 years,
mining anthracite coal for which there is a strong demand. Last year more
than 800,000 tonnes were imported.
Mr Cook said the buy-out's adviser, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, had already had
strong interest in the plan from City backers. Betws is one of five pits
that were put out for tender on Thursday, the others being Rossington,
Markham Main, Bevercotes and Clipston.

THREE APPEAL Court judges yesterday reserved judgment on the appeal by Mr
Peter Clowes, the jailed financier, against his conviction on 10 charges of
theft, John Mason writes.
Mr Clowes, who is in Wandsworth prison serving a 10-year jail sentence,
appealed against the theft charges, but not the eight counts of fraud of
which he was also convicted at the end of his trial last February.
He claimed that Barlow Clowes International had authority from investors to
invest their money as it thought fit, and was more like a banking operation
than a trust fund company.
Mr Peter Naylor, who has served an 18-month sentence for theft, also
appealed against his conviction.
No date was set for the court to announce its decision.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Governors to scrutinise BBC performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC board of governors will spend three days next week assessing the
performance of every aspect of the corporation.
It is the first of an annual series of performance reviews to be carried out
by the BBC and includes in a new-style annual report to be published on July
28.
In January Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, outlined his policies for
the organisation. He said: 'The annual performance review will be the
flywheel that drives the BBC and keeps us alert and self-questioning about
everything we do.'
At the three-day session being held at a unnamed hotel in the home counties
Mr Birt will present a formal assessment of the BBC's programme output,
efficiency, effectiveness and accountability.
The programme targets will not deal in crude audience size but will be
measured against how a particular type of programme should have been
expected to perform.
The BBC has been lagging behind commercial television in the ratings - often
taking only between 40 per cent and 42 per cent of total viewing.
Some recent BBC dramas, such as A Year In Provence, have not only been
critical failures but have also attracted low audiences.
In reviewing the efficiency of the corporation the governors will be able to
look at the serious potential overspends of the past two years and whether
all dangers of a recurrence have now been eliminated.
The BBC is declining to say where this year's performance review is being
held in the hope of avoiding the arrival of a large number of journalists.
Last year the old-style annual conference was at Lucknam Park, near Bath,
which led to journalists assessing the quality of the wine and the food
being enjoyed by the BBC governors and top management.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Future is far from secure for born-again truckmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RECEIVERS and management buy-out teams celebrate the rescue of the former
Leyland Daf truck and van operations, serious obstacles remain to the
long-term viability of the ventures:
The new companies are being launched into a business environment that
remains hostile.
During the long weeks of receivership, rivals have been trying to bite
heavily into Daf's market share and undermine its dealer networks.
The van and truck operations will not control the lucrative spare parts
business, and will derive only royalty income from parts.
The new ventures will need to generate substantial funds to finance new
product development.
The deep recession that brought the Daf group to its knees may be starting
to lift in the UK, but conditions are deteriorating rapidly in continental
Europe, where Leyland Daf must sell a significant part of its light truck
output.
In the UK new commercial vehicle registrations in the first five months of
this year were still 4.5 per cent below those for the corresponding period
last year and 50.6 per cent below the 1989 peak.
The medium and heavy van market, in which Leyland Daf Vans is competing, is
where demand is weakest.
The truck market is showing some signs of life, but from a very low base.
UK truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) last year were 55 per
cent below the peak sales of 69,234 achieved in 1989. Overall West European
truck sales fell by 25 per cent in the first quarter this year.
The heavy cost of developing new products helped bring down the old Daf
group and it could well prove eventually to be the Achilles heel of the new
ventures. Pulled together out of the wreckage of the old Daf group, they
will probably still need to find strategic partners to survive in the long
term.
Leyland Daf Vans in Birmingham has lost access to Daf's continental dealer
network, and so has had to base its hopes for survival on the UK market
alone.
It is concentrating efforts chiefly on sales of basic, low-cost utility
panel vans to large fleet customers such as the Post Office.
It has also been forced to drop out of a project to develop a new generation
van in a joint venture with Renault, the huge cost of which helped bring
about Daf's collapse.
The MBO will be forced to rely instead on further development of the present
vans, which were originally launched 20 years ago as the Sherpa van by the
then British Leyland.
But the new ventures do have some advantages. They have been relieved of old
debt burdens, and the heavy costs of restructuring and rationalisation have
disappeared through the receivership. The truck plant workforce has agreed
to a pay freeze until the end of 1994 and to a package of far-reaching
reforms in working practices in support of the rescue deal.
Mr John Gilchrist, leader of the successful Leyland truck plant MBO team,
claimed the Leyland plant had a lower cost per vehicle than any of its
rivals.
The Leyland plant is pinning its hopes for survival on being 'a dedicated
contract manufacturer' of commercial vehicles. It is aiming to manufacture
its own designed vehicles and it will seek also to assemble other makes
under contract.
Much may depend on whether it can win repeat business from the Ministry of
Defence for military vehicles to help to even out the wild fluctuations in
demand in civilian markets.
Military work has been an important factor in helping it through the
receivership. Now it has only 300 of a 1,500 order for heavy ammunition
carrying trucks left to complete by spring next year along with 2,000 of a
5,500 order for general service British Army trucks to be completed by
spring 1995.
The remnants of the Daf group may have a future, but it is far from a secure
one.

assembly plant - Dutch unit gets dealer network / Council offshoot acquires

<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team reached agreement yesterday to take over the
Leyland Daf truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire from the
administrative receivers.
The MBO is one of the most significant steps in the rescue of the former Daf
group in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium, which collapsed into
receivership at the beginning of February.
The deal announced on the shop floor was greeted with an emotional
two-minute ovation by the workforce of 700.
In a parallel move Daf Trucks of the Netherlands, which was created in March
to take over the core medium and heavy truck operations of the old Daf group
in the Netherlands and Belgium, reached agreement with the UK receivers to
acquire Leyland Daf Trucks, the former UK marketing and sales arm in Thame,
Oxfordshire.
The Dutch group will control the UK Leyland Daf dealer network and will
market and sell the 45 series light trucks and other heavier models made in
Leyland through this network in Britain along with its own heavy trucks. It
will also sell the UK-built light trucks through its existing dealer network
in continental Europe.
The two deals secure the 700 jobs at the Leyland assembly plant and 150 at
Thame.
As part of the MBO deal the entire 230-acre site in Leyland has been
acquired from the receivers by Lancashire Enterprises, the development arm
of Lancashire County Council, for development as a business and technology
park.
The new MBO company, Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, will lease the site of
the assembly plant.
The buy-out, led by Mr John Gilchrist, Leyland Daf's managing director, has
been backed by Pounds 5m of equity funding from Barclays Development
Capital. Working capital finance has been provided by National Westminster
Bank.
Mr Gilchrist yesterday forecast a turnover of Pounds 140m and an output of
about 10,000 trucks in the first 12 months of operation.
When Daf collapsed in February the group had about 12,000 jobs in the UK,
the Netherlands and Belgium.
If the remaining parts of the group are rescued as planned that total will
have been virtually halved with about 2,845 jobs remaining in the UK (there
were 5,500) 2,500 in the Netherlands (5,000) and 750 in Belgium (1,500).
The truck plant management buy-out has put in place the most crucial piece
of the jigsaw in the complex rescue of the failed Daf commercial vehicle
operations in the UK.
It may appear to potential truck and van buyers as if business is being
resumed as normal with the same products, the same brand names, and
virtually the same dealers.
Behind the scenes, however, the former group has been broken into
independent units, separately owned and financed, but still linked through
arm's-length supply agreements and buyer-seller deals.
According to Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, one of the
joint administrative receivers, the rescue of the UK business has been the
biggest and most complex manufacturing receivership in the UK since the
collapse of Rolls-Royce in the early 1970s. Leyland Daf had an annual
turnover of Pounds 350m.
He said: 'At one time we thought it might be too complicated to hold it all
together.'
The Daf group collapsed with debts of more than Fl 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) after
running up net losses in the previous three years of Fl 880m.
Before the collapse the workforce in the UK and the Netherlands had already
been cut to 12,289 in 1992 from 16,782 in 1989. By the time the rescues are
completed it will be halved again to about 6,000.
Including yesterday's crucial agreements separate rescues have now been
completed for:
the Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck operations in Eindhoven
and Westerlo.
The Birmingham-based van operations.
The truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire.
The truck marketing and sales operation in Thame, Oxfordshire.
Still to be finalised are the rescues of the Albion axle plant in Glasgow,
the spare parts distribution business in Chorley, Lancashire - now trading
under the name Multipart - the Leyland components and test facilities, and
the disposal of the assembly and sales operations in Africa.
The core medium and heavy-duty truck operations in the Netherlands and
Belgium were the first parts of the collapsed Daf group to be rescued at the
beginning of March.
A new company, Daf Trucks NV, was formed with the backing of fresh equity
and subordinated loans totalling about Fl 445m. About half of that figure
was provided by the Dutch government and the Flemish regional government,
with the remainder coming from a group of Dutch and Belgian banks,
institutions and, to a limited extent, from suppliers, dealers and
importers.
Daf Trucks expects to produce about 10,000 medium and heavy duty trucks this
year and is forecasting an annual turnover in a full year of Fl 2bn.
The receivers' first success was at the end of April with the MBO of the
Leyland Daf van operations in Birmingham.
The formation of the new company, Leyland Daf Vans, was supported by about
Pounds 6.5m of equity finance from the venture capital group 3i. Other main
elements included working capital and a bank loan of more than Pounds 7m
provided by Royal Bank of Scotland, financing of up to Pounds 20m from
United Dominions Trust, a TSB Bank subsidiary, for dealer stocks, and UK
state aid of Pounds 9m.
According to Mr Allan Amey, chief executive and leader of the MBO team,
Leyland Daf Vans expects to achieve a turnover of about Pounds 150m in its
first year of operation. It is forecasting output of about 12,000 vans a
year.
By securing the future of the UK truck and van plants the way has been
opened for disposal of the remaining operations.
The lucrative former Leyland Daf spare parts distribution and warehouse
business at Chorley, Lancashire, now trading under the Multipart brand name,
has reached parts management and royalty agreements with the UK van and
truck manufacturing operations and with Daf Trucks NV.
With a turnover before receivership of Pounds 140m a year it was the most
immediately viable part of the collapsed group with about 200,000 Leyland
Daf vans and trucks on the road in the UK and still requiring replacement
parts.
An MBO team led by Mr David Little, operations director, is negotiating with
the receiver. It faces stiff competition from organisations including
Unipart, the vehicle parts distributor and manufacturer.
The Albion axle plant in Glasgow has negotiated long-term supply agreements
with its main customers, Leyland Daf Vans and Leyland Trucks Manufacturing.
The plant is likely to be acquired by Scottish engineering interests in the
next few weeks.

FT  12 JUN 93 / CSO warns first quarter figures more likely to revision than
normal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Statistical Office warned yesterday that the first-quarter trade
figures were more than usually liable to revision as a new system for
measuring EC trade flows settled down, Emma Tucker writes.
The figures showed little change in the UK's trade deficit with the European
Community.
Following the opening of the single market at the end of last year, Customs
declarations - the old source of trade statistics - are no longer required
for movements of goods within the community.
Intrastat, a system for measuring intra-EC trade statistics, has therefore
been introduced. It takes its information from a combination of surveys and
value added tax returns.
The CSO said Customs had received returns from traders representing about 86
per cent of the value of exports and 78 per cent of imports in the first
quarter. 'As a result, estimates for the first quarter are less reliable,
are subject to greater revision than usual and have been shown rounded to
the nearest Pounds 100m,' it said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Make lottery a charity, says peer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINAL attempt will be made in the House of Lords next week to try to
transform the government's planned National Lottery into a charitable
foundation.
Lord Birkett will propose a series of amendments similar to those put
forward by Sir Ivan Lawrence, the Conservative MP, in the House of Commons
but not debated.
Lord Birkett is a director of Lottery Promotion Company, a non-profit making
body which has been campaigning for charitable status for the lottery.
The company believes charitable status would not only increase the money
going to good causes such as sport and the arts but would help to prevent
political interference in the allocation of the money. It would also reduce
the danger of lottery funds being substituted for existing Exchequer
spending.
Mr Denis Vaughan, executive director of the company, said yesterday it was
obvious that a national lottery should be at arm's length from government.
'Every other country has had difficulty with this. We must learn from them,'
Mr Vaughan said.
The company believes it has all-party support for the amendments in the
Lords and that government plans would 'hand an unnecessary amount of profit
to the private sector'.
The company said if the amendment was carried arts, sport and heritage could
each hope to receive Pounds 285m a year from a Pounds 3bn lottery turnover.
The government hopes that the lottery - which could be the world's biggest -
will be launched next year.
It is intended to raise money for the arts, heritage, sports, charities and
a new fund to celebrate the year 2000.
Independent estimates suggest the lottery could generate sales of more than
Pounds 4bn a year.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Sugar's QC denies that Venables had deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur football club, denied reaching
any agreement with Mr Terry Venables, the club's chief executive, that he
would never use his larger shareholding to vote against him, the High Court
was told yesterday.
On the second day of the hearing over whether the injunction preventing Mr
Venables' sacking should be lifted, Mr Philip Heslop, QC for Mr Sugar, said
the attempted dismissal had been properly handled. Even if there had been
such an agreement between the two men, as Mr Venables had claimed, there was
nothing to stop the board getting rid of him if it wished, Mr Heslop said.
'It is not right or arguable that this company has the burden of having to
employ Mr Venables as chief executive indefinitely,' he said.
Earlier Mr Martin Mann QC repeated Mr Venables' claim that when the two men
took control of the club in June 1991 they had agreed not to vote against
each other.
However, after the club's re-financing rights issue in November 1991, in
which Mr Sugar increased his holding, the chairman refused to sign a written
agreement that this arrangement would continue.
Mr Venables said in an affidavit that he had been 'naive' to agree to the
rights issue going ahead - and any trust he had in Mr Sugar - evaporated
afterwards. Mr Heslop said the evidence of the majority of the board was
that they no longer had any confidence in Mr Venables' ability to discharge
his function.
The decision to remove Mr Venables was not just Mr Sugar's but that of the
Spurs board. 'The company appointed him and the company dismissed him,' he
said.
Mr Venables himself had no right, except in very special circumstances, to
reverse the board's decision. There had been no attempt to exclude him from
being involved in the affairs of the company as a director, Mr Heslop said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR Mahathir Mohamad (above), Malaysia's prime minister, leaves on a 10-day
visit to China this weekend, along with more than 300 business people and
officials, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The delegation, one of the largest ever to go to China, will tour several
industrial sites and sign a number of agreements with Chinese corporations.
Dr Mahathir is scheduled to meet Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, early
next week. Mr Li has not been seen in public for more than six weeks and
there have been reports that he has been seriously ill.
Malaysia's policy towards China has changed considerably recently. Malaysia
was once deeply suspicious of what it saw as China's potential influence
over Malaysia's large Chinese community and the two countries are among
rival claimants to the Spratly islands in the South China Sea. Malaysia and
China recently agreed to co-operate on the Spratlys issue. Malaysia has also
called for China's inclusion in any emerging security framework in the south
Asia region.
'China is currently and has every reason to continue to be a benign power,'
said Mr Mohamad Najib, Malaysia's defence minister, recently.
While Dr Mahathir has been urging Malaysia's businesspeople to seek business
opportunities in China there is some concern in Kuala Lumpur that foreign
investors are moving their funds away from Malaysia and into China.
Trade between China and Malaysia has grown four-fold in the past five years
to reach Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.19bn) in 1992.

FT  12 JUN 93 / UN set for Somalia strike: Leslie Crawford sees the country
sinking into a military quagmire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE THE rains now churning mud and garbage in Mogadishu's filthy streets,
the United Nations' humanitarian intervention in Somalia is rapidly sinking
into a military quagmire.
The killing of 23 Pakistani Blue Helmets last Saturday has brought UN forces
to the brink of war with Somalia's most defiant clan leader, Gen Mohamed
Farah Aideed.
An air strike against his strongholds in the south of the capital was
thought last night to be imminent, now that the evacuation of almost 500 UN
civilian staff and international aid workers to Nairobi has been completed.
In a sign that retaliation was planned, the United Nations Operation in
Somalia (Unosom) decided to close Mogadishu airport to all civilian flights
from midnight last night. Only Unosom flights and military aircraft will be
permitted to land until further notice.
Earlier, the US ordered the aircraft carrier Wasp and three other ships to
leave the Gulf and stand by for possible action in Somalia. The ships carry
2,200 Marines who have previously served in Somalia.
The handful of aid workers who remain in Mogadishu have retreated into
heavily fortified compounds. UN troops are combing the suburbs for weapons
and have reboubled security at key installations. Military reinforcements,
including US AC 130 Spectre precision bombers, are said to be within
striking distance of Mogadishu.
In a final attempt to avert another bloodbath, the UN delivered a letter to
Gen Aideed demanding he hand over those responsible for Saturday's slaughter
 -the deadliest single strike against its peacekeepers in over 30 years.
The letter is also believed to have included an ultimatum to the warlord:
disarm your militias, hand over your weapons and close down your radio
station, or face the consequences.
But Thursday night's broadcast on Gen Aideed's 'Voice of the Somali Masses'
clandestine radio station continued to pour vitriol over the UN's presence
in Somalia. It called on UN troops to leave the country and warned that the
next message would be 'written in blood.'
At a press conference yesterday, however, Gen Aideed appeared to be adopting
a more conciliatory stance, although he placed the blame for last weekend's
clashes on UN peacekeepers. He asked the UN to appoint an independent
commission to investigate the incident. He said the death toll had risen to
89, while another 350 people were wounded.
The UN and Gen Aideed continue to give differing accounts of what happened
last Saturday. The UN says Pakistani soldiers were ambushed at several
points of the city in a premeditated and orchestrated attack. Gen Aideed
insists that he no longer commands militias or weapons and that the clashes
were a spontaneous uprising.
As the military tension escalates, the original ideals that inspired the
UN's unprecedented humanitarian mission in Somalia appear to lie in the
rubble of the war-torn capital.
'The relief work is dead,' says Jamie McGoldrick, one of only three Save the
Children Fund foreign staff to remain in Mogadishu. 'This has become a
purely military operation.'
Although Mr McGoldrick is still managing to deliver a few emergency medical
supplies to hospitals, the 35 feeding centres in the Somali capital are
closed. Some 200,000 people in the capital who rely on food rations are
going hungry. Meanwhile, 15,000 tonnes of food are lying idle in the port.
Outside the capital, UN spokesman Faruq Malawi says food stocks will last 10
days.
It is not only months of relief work that have gone to waste. Last
Saturday's killings also destroyed the UN's faltering efforts to broker a
political reconciliation between rival Somali clans. Since a UN-sponsored
peace conference in Addis Ababa in March, mediators had achieved some
success in negotiating local truces and bringing the clan elders together.
Such tentative diplomatic gains are now at risk.
In weighing its response to Gen Aideed's aggression, the UN will have to
consider not only its international reputation and role as peacekeeper, but
its responsibilities towards a country it has adopted as a de facto
protectorate.
In private, UN officials say they cannot afford to let the terrorist actions
of a gun-toting warlord go unpunished. But retaliation could trigger a wave
of sympathy for Gen Aideed and unite rival warlords against UN troops. The
18,300-peacekeeping force would come to be regarded as an occupying foreign
army. Already, Somalis regard the UN intervention as humiliating evidence of
their inability to manage their own affairs.
'The UN wants to destroy and humiliate Aideed in front of his people,' says
Mr McGoldrick. He fears the multinational force underestimates the size of
Gen Aideed's constituency - thousands of young men who, by his patronage,
can carve out an easy existence from looting, extortion and banditry. They
have a vested interest in anarchy.
On the streets of the Somali capital this week, there was much brave talk of
rallying to Gen Aideed's defence. There is no shortage of guns. Mogadishu
was awash with unfounded rumours of UN cruelty against the local residents -
40 hostages held, three Somalis killed, arbitrary arrests. Hostility towards
their would-be benefactors was palpable.
Others were cutting their losses. War refugees who had sought a safe haven
in Mogadishu were leaving the capital in droves. One entrepreneur, who
supplied electricity from looted generators to much of south Mogadishu, shut
down his business this week and packed his bags. A sign outside his shop
said: 'No More War.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / China and UK to hold more talks on HK airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPEARANCE of greater Anglo-Chinese co-operation over Hong Kong was
bolstered yesterday when the two sides agreed to hold both a second round of
talks on the colony's multi-billion dollar airport and a meeting of the
Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
The meeting later this month of the JLG, which works out the details of the
transfer, will be the first since late last year. It could provide Beijing
with a face-saving forum in which to 'approve' the construction of Hong
Kong's ninth container terminal, CT9.
Since last November, China has blocked development of the container terminal
as part of its strategy of non-co-operation on economic matters in
retaliation for Governor Chris Patten announcing plans for Hong Kong's
political development. Howver, there have been some signals that China might
be prepared to de-link aspects of the colony's economic development from
those of its political development.
The outcome of next Friday's meeting of the Airport Committee will be
watched closely to see if Beijing is prepared to give its approval to the
construction of the Western Harbour Crossing - a submarine tunnel vital for
the airport project - and associated land reclamation works.
Also next week, Anglo-Chinese officials meet in Beijing for the fifth round
of talks about Hong Kong's political development.
The British team will try to engage the Chinese in detailed discussions
about Hong Kong's 1994-1995 elections, having touched on them only briefly
in earlier discussions.
The Chinese have said that they want to use the fifth round to ascertain
Britain's 'sincerity' in the process.
Beijing has been angered by a committee of the Legislative Council (LegCo),
Hong Kong's law making body, discussing Mr Patten's plans for political
reform, and by observations of a junior British foreign office minister that
LegCo could amend any agreement reached by the two sides.
Observers in Hong Kong have suggested that Beijing's concern with
'sincerity' is a convenient device to delay the real business of the
negotiations.

The appointment of the former vice-president and senator from Minnesota,
leaked earlier this week, has been warmly received in Japan, according to US
media reports from Tokyo.
Mr Mondale has been freely compared with the revered former ambassador,
ex-senator Mike Mansfield, as a heavyweight politician with connections and
influence with the President and with Congress.
Mr Clinton said yesterday in a Rose Garden ceremony also attended by Mr
Mansfield that Mr Mondale, vice-president from 1977 to 1981 and the losing
Democratic candidate in the 1984 election, was renowned for 'building bonds
of understanding around the world.'
He was, the president said, 'extraordinarily well qualified to be given the
task of enhancing our relationship with Japan and projecting American
leadership in Asia and the Pacific region.'
Mr Mondale also struck a note that will be appreciated in Japan, saying that
'although we are economic competitors, we share a fundamental
interdependence,' both in each other's economy and in the growth of the
global economy.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Japan ready to test US resolve on targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THEIR first few months of dealing with the Clinton administration,
Japanese trade officials were busy trying to assess how serious the US was
in its calls for measurable targets in opening up Japan's markets.
As they face their US counterparts in their first round of trade talks,
which began yesterday in Washington, the Japanese now are able to test first
hand the resolve of the Clinton administration in pressing for measurable
progress.
With just a few weeks to go before the two nations are committed to agree a
framework for bilateral trade negotiations, Japanese officials still cling
to the hope that, in the end, their arguments against the dangers of the
US's results-oriented trade policy will prevail.
In response against US demands to establish measurable indicators of
progress in opening up the country's markets, the Japanese authorities have
taken up the banner of free trade, assuming the moral high ground.
'Given the importance of US-Japan trade and the influence it has on world
trade, what we decide to do is important enough that it will determine what
kind of world trade system we want to leave our children in the 21st
century,' says a foreign affairs official.
He argues that there is no alternative to the free trade system that has
guided the world since the end of the second world war. Any benchmark used
to measure economic activity, whether it be the number of foreign
subsidiaries that are set up in Japan, or the ratio of imports to gross
domestic product, leads to managed trade, he says.
But there is another reason for Japanese sensitivity towards numerical
targets.
The US-Japan semiconductor arrangement, which recognised the US expectation
that the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market would reach 20 per
cent by the end of 1992, appeared to prove that Japan's markets were indeed
'managed' when that expectation was met.
That arrangement has been hailed by US officials as a model to be emulated
in other sectors, and the Japanese authorities have been at pains to dispel
the perception that if pushed they can control economic activity so that
such targets are met.
Unless it insists now that it cannot control economic activity in a free
trade system, the Japanese government fears that it could soon find itself
faced with demands from other countries or regions, not least the EC, to do
the same.
'Reducing the trade surplus is beyond the reach of the government because
the surplus is the result of economic activity,' the official emphasises.
If the Clinton administration is determined to achieve quick results in
reducing Japan's trade surplus, the Japanese authorities are just as firm
that it will take considerable time and patience to resolve the situation.
Japanese officials do not expect the current talks in Washington to produce
concrete results.
In keeping with Japanese custom it will be more a chance for both sides to
get to know each other and confirm each other's position.
They have drawn up a six-point guideline that underlines their refusal to
accept numerical measures, in spite of signs that the Clinton administration
is willing to be 'flexible' on demands for numerical indicators.
Measures that could lead to managed trade are to be avoided as well as
unilateral actions such as those allowed by the Super-301 trade bill.
The guideline also insists that any agreement should be done according to
internationally accepted rules and should benefit third countries as well as
Japan and the US. Discussion must be limited to matters within the
government's reach.
In addition, Japan will insist that the discussions should be a joint
exercise, with the US dealing with its problems as well.
One key problem the US has which Japan intends to cite, for example, is its
low level of savings.
Although the Japanese insist that no compromise is possible on the issue of
measuring results, officials in Tokyo are confident that the US and Japan
will eventually be able to take their talks forward.
There are alternative proposals on the Japanese drawing board being kept as
a last resort.
The show of confidence in Tokyo stems in part from a conviction that it has
significant international support for its opposition to results-oriented
trade policy.
Tokyo is also firm in its belief that the bilateral relationship is too
important to be dealt with through quick-fix measures such as fixing targets
on market access.
That belief is increasingly coupled with a feeling in Tokyo that the
US-Japan relationship has reached a turning point and that Washington is
beginning to treat Japan more as an equal.
Confirmation reached Tokyo on Thursday that the US intends to back Japan's
permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
'The US-Japan relationship has become a mature political relationship in
which it is possible to speak frankly and discusss things frankly and this
is a good development which allows for constructive talks,' says the foreign
ministry official.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Recovery in autumn, says central bank

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan in its quarterly survey of the economy published yesterday
conspicuously failed to back up the government's assessment that the
Japanese economy has hit the bottom of its long downturn.
The central bank said it was too early to say the economy had bottomed out
because consumer spending and capital expenditure were still depressed.
On Thursday, the head of the government's Economic Planning Agency provoked
controversy and criticism from business leaders and the powerful industry
ministry after he said the agency's quarterly report suggested the economy
was bottoming out.
However, the bank believes the trough of the recession will be reached in
the next few months, paving the way for a moderate recovery from the second
half of this fiscal year which began in April.
It believes consumer spending will pick up as consumers start to replace
durable goods they bought in the 1980s. This will be underpinned by the
Y24,000bn (Pounds 148.6bn) of emergency public spending the government has
approved over the past year.
The bank's quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment found that the key
gauge of corporate confidence had stopped declining for the first time since
August 1989, its last peak.
The index of business conditions for major manufacturing enterprises stood
at -49 in the survey, conducted in May. The February survey also recorded
sentiment of -49. The index measures the difference in the percentage share
of companies reporting business conditions as favourable, minus those
reporting it as unfavourable. The measure has declined from -24 a year ago.
The bank warned that the survey of 716 large enterprises was taken while the
yen was trading at Y110 to the dollar. Since then the yen has strengthened
further to about Y106 to the dollar, which is likely to have further
depressed the short-term outlook for exporters.
The index of business conditions for non-manufacturing enterprises fell from
 33 in the February to -38 in the May survey.
Manufacturing companies reported a slight improvement in the balance of
demand and supply for their products and a reduction in their inventories. A
balance of about 31 per cent of companies reported they had excess
inventories, compared with 38 per cent in February. A continued reduction in
inventories could lead to a pick-up in industrial production in the second
half of the financial year.
However the survey suggests Japanese manufacturers are facing intense price
competition, partly as a result of the strengthening of the yen, which is
likely to eat into their profit margins.
Among manufacturers the index of price conditions, which measures expected
increases in output prices against expected falls, stood at -23.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Miyazawa defends global trading role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday firmly rejected
any new boost for the Japanese economy, and, at a time of tension with the
US over Japan's huge trade surplus, robustly defended his country's role in
the global trading system.
He said he believed Japan was on the road to recovery, with the fiscal
stimulus packages of April and last August 'more than sufficient to help
Japan's economy back on track'. Japan was just as open to imports as the US
and EC, he said, and was contributing most towards the conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
While expressing confidence that over time the market economy system would
bring prosperity in the post-Cold War world, he was doubtful about the
future of Russia and other former Soviet republics.
'No one is quite sure if the former Soviet Union will be democratic and will
have a market economy,' he said.
Aid for Russia would be the biggest issue at the July 7-9 economic summit of
the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in Tokyo, he predicted.
At the same time, Mr Miyazawa promised that Japan would play a bigger role
in world affairs, especially through the United Nations. But while Japan
would like to be invited to join the UN Security Council as a permanent
member, it 'would not campaign' for such a position.
'It is not a question for Japan alone,' the prime minister observed. 'If we
take a strong approach, we might hamper the functioning of the Security
Council.'
Japan realised that achieving its goal, which is supported by the US but
likely to be opposed by other Security Council members, would be a 'very
long process,' he said.
Looking sprightly and cracking an occasional joke, the 73-year-old leader
pointed out that Japan's most recent Dollars 116bn (Pounds 76bn) economic
stimulus package was seven times the size of president Bill Clinton's
programme to boost the US economy, and, unlike the US measures, had passed
their parliamentary hurdle.
On trade, virtually the only issue standing between Japan and a successful
settlement of the Uruguay Round was its protecting of rice growers which was
'not supposed to be a major issue for either the US and Europe,' he said.
To promote a Uruguay Round market access agreement in time for the Tokyo
summit, Japan had offered tariff concessions on 770 manufactured items and
was prepared to cut its average tariff to 1.5 per cent from 3.6 per cent.
The prime minister cited International Monetary Fund figures to show that
Japan imported as much per head as the US or the EC: some Dollars 1,900 in
1991 against Dollars 2,000 for the US and Dollars 1,800 for the EC from
non-Community countries.
Japan was not a 'fortress' Mr Miyazawa insisted. Nor would east Asia become
a fortress, because the economies and societies in the area were too
diverse. Indeed, Mr Miyazawa took a relatively sanguine view of the
emergence of regional trading blocs. Neither the EC nor the North American
Free Trade Area (Nafta) would turn into economic fortresses because of the
power of modern global communications to prevent this.
However, he voiced one concern held strongly in Japanese business circles.
European integration and the disappearance of internal barriers in the EC
had created problems for Japan, he said. Restrictions were being placed on
European car imports 'which were against the spirit of market integration in
Europe,' he said. This was a 'problem we may have to sit with for a little
while.'
He promised that, at the Tokyo summit, Japan would raise by about 50 per
cent its overseas development assistance and the so-called recycling
resources - loans, guarantees and export credits - made available to
developing countries. The increased spending plans would replace aid and
loan allocations that have totalled about Dollars 50bn over the past five
years.
The prime minister said Japan 'must contribute as much as possible' to
issues such as arms control and disarmament and in international efforts to
deal with the problems of refugees, disease and the environment.

China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who triggered a boom that has led to
the world's fastest economic growth rate, has warned against letting the
economy spin out of control, a pro-Beijing newspaper said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
The Communist Party's top policy-making body will meet shortly to tackle the
problems caused by the economy charging ahead at rates that surpassed 14 per
cent in the first quarter this year, the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po said.
Inflation, even by official figures, is more than 17 per cent in key cities.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Court ban fails to halt Nigerian poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S presidential election will go ahead today as planned in spite of a
court ruling ordering a postponement, the National Electoral Commission
(NEC) said yesterday.
The government, meanwhile, called on the US to pull out one of its diplomats
within 72 hours, accusing him of 'blatant interference'. The diplomat is
spokesman for the US embassy in Lagos, which declared earlier yesterday that
postponement of the election would cause 'grave concern' to the US.
In a day of high political drama, NEC chairman Humphrey Nwosu said in Abuja,
Nigeria's federal capital: 'For the avoidance of any doubt I wish to restate
that the presidential election scheduled for tomorrow. . . will go on as
planned.' His announcement appeared to put Nigeria's programme for the
return of civilian rule back on track.
Nigerians had waited anxiously for the reply by the NEC, a creation of the
country's military rulers, to the Abuja high court, which had ordered the
poll be put off.
The court ruled on Thursday that the first presidential poll since 1983
should wait until the full hearing of a petition by a group wanting army
president, Mr Ibrahim Babangida, to stay in power until 1997.
But the NEC chairman said the court order was overruled by provisions of a
military decree issued this year which said no court had the power to stop
an election. Mr Nwosu said the decree was 'a deliberate legislation on the
part of this administration to protect the higher interests of the majority
of Nigerians in the implementation of the political transition programme'.
The last-minute hitch raised doubts over whether Mr Babangida intends to
hand over to civilian rule on August 27. Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti of the
Campaign for Democracy said: 'We still do not believe that Babangida wants
to go. He is making the simple process of handover the most complicated
thing in the world.'
The case was brought to court by the Association for Better Nigeria, which
is campaigning for a four-year extension of military rule, and alleges
malpractice by the political parties in the run-up to the elections.
The association is led by businessman and former presidential candidate Mr
Arthur Nzeribe, who has close links with the presidency.
Although the government has made no attempt to stop the association's
operations, political meetings by groups opposed to continued military rule
have frequently been broken up by the security forces.
Voting in today's election is expected to follow tribal and regional
loyalties. The National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate, Mr Bashir
Tofa, is a Moslem from the north, where the party has traditional support
among the Hausa-Fulani and other mainly Moslem groups. The choice of Mr
Sylvester Ugoh, who was a central bank governor of the former breakaway
Biafran state, as his running mate has also bolstered his support in the
mainly Christian south-east.
Mr Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the Social Democratic party, has the
backing of his fellow Yoruba in the south-west and his party is strong in
the north-east.
Britain and other EC member states have sent diplomats, MPs and officials to
most of Nigeria's 30 states to observe the elections. All political rallies
have been banned until 4pm today, while the open ballot system, which was
vulnerable to vote rigging in previous presidential campaigns, has been
modified.

FT  12 JUN 93 / US inflation figures ease fears of interest rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates in the
US eased yesterday after the release of encouraging inflation figures.
The Labour Department said the producer price index was unchanged last month
after increases of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent in March and April. The
annual rate of wholesale price inflation dropped to 2 per cent from 2.4 per
cent in April.
Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 0.1 per cent rise in retail
sales last month, which was smaller than expected.
Share and bond prices rose as analysts discounted the chance of an immediate
tightening of monetary policy. The dollar weakened slightly against leading
currencies.
Consumer prices for May, due on Tuesday, are also expected to show an ebbing
in inflationary pressures. If so, the Fed seems certain to leave rates
unchanged at 3 per cent for at least the next month. Many economists predict
that inflationary pressures will remain moderate throughout the summer, in
which case the Fed may take no action before September or October.
Speculation about a possible rise in rates grew intense last month after the
third set of bad inflation figures since Christmas. The annualised rate of
inflation for the first four months was more than 4 per cent compared with 3
per cent in 1992.
Concerns were exacerbated when press leaks indicated that Fed governors and
regional presidents voted last month to shift from a neutral stance on
interest rates to a bias towards raising them. Minutes of a previous meeting
showed that two Fed governors were pressing for higher rates as long ago as
March.
However, a shift to a bias towards raising rates does not necessarily imply
an early tightening of policy.
The Fed may simply have wanted to reassure financial markets that it was
concerned about inflation until distortions which pushed up price figures
earlier this year began to unwind.
Many economists have long argued that the monthly figures had to improve
because the economic recovery was too weak to put sustained upward pressure
on prices.
Wage settlements are moderate and the unemployment rate, at 6.9 per cent, is
well above the level that has previously led to higher inflation.
If economic growth continues, the Fed is expected to nudge rates higher over
the next 12 to 18 months to a more sustainable level of perhaps 4 to 4.5 per
cent.

FT  12 JUN 93 / BAe plans new turbo-prop aircraft: British manufacturer to
strengthen its regional airliner range
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE plans to launch two regional turbo-propellor aircraft
programmes by the end of the year to strengthen its family of Jetstream
commuter and regional airliners.
The company, which has restructured its turbo-propellor activities by
concentrating them at Prestwick in Scotland, said yesterday at the Paris Air
Show it was discussing with the UK department of trade and industry the
Pounds 450m funding of the two projects.
These will involve development of a 72-seater Jetstream 71 and a 50-seat
Jetstream 51 to complement the existing Jetstream range, which includes the
19-seat Jetstream 31, the 29-seat Jetstream 41 and the 64-seat ATP (advance
turbo-propellor) aircraft.
BAe is also stepping up discussions with international partners to try to
form a broader strategic alliance in the turbo-propellor business.
The company is now adopting a similar approach to its turbo-propellor
activities as for its 146 regional jet business which has been turned into a
joint company with Taiwan Aerospace.
As part of its restructuring programme, BAe also transferred all its
Jetstream and ATP activities to Prestwick where it employs about 2,400. It
is spending Pounds 27m this year to improve the Prestwick plant.
Mr Allan MacDonald, managing director of BAe's Jetstream subsidiary, said
the new products would give a clear signal to the market that BAe was
serious about staying in the turbo-propellor business. It would also
strengthen the company's hand in negotiating a strategic alliance with
international partners as part of the rationalisation of the commuter and
regional aircraft industry.
'There are too many manufacturers and products in this market, but we want
to lead the process of rationalisation,' Mr Mac-Donald said.
The reorganisation of Jetstream activities at Prestwick would take 24 to 36
months, he added.
The business earns about Pounds 250m a year but this is expected to grow to
Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m a year after the new products are launched and the
reorganisation is completed.
He said the new aircraft programmes would help sustain employment at
Prestwick.
Avro International, BAe's new regional jet joint venture company with
Taiwan, announced yesterday it had won an order worth Dollars 140m from the
Turkish national airline THY. It involves firm orders for five regional jets
and options for an additional three.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Aids epidemic poised to sweep the developing world: 'In some
Ugandan villages there is no one between 20 and 40, only children and
grandparents'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the red light districts of Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, the virus that
causes Aids is running rampant. Among prostitutes on the city's streets 88
per cent are HIV-positive. Among their clients, who pay less than Dollars 4
a time, only a quarter are willing to use condoms, the best method of
preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
The effect of such levels of infection among prostitutes is wreaking a
devastating effect on Abidjan's more general population. One in six pregnant
women is now HIV-positive. Most say they have slept only with their
husbands.
Although HIV and Aids remain a significant problem in the western world,
delegates at the annual Aids conference in Berlin this week were repeatedly
told the epidemic is going to hit the developing world disproportionately
hard.
About 90 per cent of the 14m people estimated by the World Health
Organisation to be infected by the virus live in developing countries. It
calculates most of the 40m people infected by the end of the decade will be
in the developing world. The sheer scale of the problem in Africa, Asia and
Latin America requires the world's attention.
Suggestions that the scale of the epidemic in Africa has been exaggerated
were dismissed by the continent's health workers.
'It is merely cynical to say there is no epidemic. In some villages in
Uganda there are no people between 20 and 40, only children and their
grandparents,' argues Mr Elhadj Assy, an executive of the international
council of Aids service organisations. 'It is time to recognise that the
virus, illness and epidemic exist.'
But although the prevalence of Aids is well documented in Africa, the most
rapid increases in the disease are occurring in other developing regions.
'While Africa suffers the explosion of Aids cases as a result of infections
ten years ago, it is in south Asia and south-east Asia that we are seeing a
rapid increase in infection,' warned Dr Michael Merson, director of WHO's
global programme on Aids. WHO estimates there are 1.5m infected by HIV in
south-east Asia, and 1m in south Asia, mostly in India.
'The growth in south and south-east Asia can only be described as
explosive,' warned Dr Merson. 'In Thailand, for example, in early 1990 there
were more than 50,000 infected people. By late 1992, there had been a
ten-fold increase with an estimated 450,000 infected,' he said.
Studies in Thailand's northern districts show that 7 per cent of military
recruits were HIV-positive. In Bangkok, the Siriraj hospital reports the
number of pregnant women infected increased by 60 per cent between the last
quarter of 1991 and the same three months in 1992.
In India, too, the rate of increase of infection is alarming. More than 30
per cent of prostitutes in Bombay are HIV-positive, and the prevalence in
the general population has increased from 1.67 cases per 1,000 in 1991 to
23.07 per 1,000 last year. 'The epidemic has the potential to reach
unprecedented levels in India,' warned Dr Shiv Lal, a director of India's
national Aids control organisation.
The epidemic is striking hardest in those countries least equipped to cope
with the disease. In many of these countries primary health care is minimal
and services have been overwhelmed. WHO calculates that in some African
cities, up to 70 per cent of hospital beds are taken up by patients with
Aids-related diseases.
The Zambian health service, for example, has been engulfed by the demands of
the country's 200,000 patients with Aids or Aids-related diseases. The
annual cost of treating them is Dollars 64.4m, money that the country can
ill afford.
In some African states, lack of resources is assisting transmission of HIV.
Delegates were told that in Cameroon there were insufficient funds to
establish safe supplies of HIV-negative blood. As many as a quarter of
patients, unable to pay for the blood offered to them to be tested, accepted
potentially contaminated blood.
Scientists at the conference admitted the chances of finding a cure or
vaccine to combat HIV in the medium term were remote. The chances of finding
anything that was affordable for developing nations was even less likely.
WHO believes the main priority must be to prevent the epidemics in the
developing world spiralling out of control. It has called for Dollars 2.5bn
a year to invested in anti-HIV programmes in developing countries  - a
10-fold increase on current spending.
The organisation calculates this could bring Dollars 90bn of savings in
direct and indirect costs by the end of the decade, by preventing 4m
infections in Africa, a similar number in Asia and 1m in Latin America.
Dr Merson claims: 'The initiative would provide a significant return in
financial terms, but above all an incalculable yield in diminished human
suffering.'

IRANIANS went to the polls yesterday, with President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani widely expected to retain power in a landslide victory, Reuter
reports from Tehran.
Mr Rafsanjani faced challenges from three rivals, all of whom professed few
differences with his policies - university president Abdullah Jasbi,
right-wing economist Ahmad Tavakkoli and former member of parliament
Rajabali Taheri.
Each has said he broadly agrees with Mr Rafsanjani's economic and political
liberalisation and each had the stamp of approval of the clerical Council of
Guardians which endorsed them as true heir of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Authorities have mounted a media campaign calling for a big turnout to show
the continued popularity of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE will temporarily retain nuclear missiles on its territory, possibly
for up to two years, Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament
and a member of the ruling troika, said yesterday.
Mr Pliushch said that escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia were
the principal reason for Kiev's hesitation to surrender its nuclear weapons.
He said relations between the two Slav neighbours had become particularly
strained recently, and accused the Russian government of making overt
territorial claims on Crimea and of initiating an 'economic blockade' by
cutting off oil supplies to Ukraine two days ago.
Mr Pliushch said that parliament would ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (Start 1) before the summer recess.
The treaty covers 130 Russian-made SS-19 inter-continental ballistic
missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory. But he said the legislature was
unlikely to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty soon.
A split decision such as this would leave Ukraine in possession of 46
Ukrainian-made SS-24 ICBMs.
Mr Pliushch's comments contradict Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's
repeated assurances this week to senior US and German leaders that the
Ukrainian government remains committed to rapid ratification of both Start 1
and non-proliferation.
But it is the legislature that will decide.
Mr Pliushch hinted that Ukrainian scientists were working to develop
negative technical control - or blocking power over the 46 Ukrainian-made
missiles.
'In terms of these 46 missiles, to develop a negative trigger is a question
of one or two years,' Mr Pliushch said. 'Who knows, maybe this mechanism
already exists.'
According to US and Russian specialists negative control over the missiles
is a short step from positive operational control - a technology which would
make Ukraine a true nuclear power.
US and Russian experts have recently voiced concerns that Ukraine has
launched a secret programme to obtain direct control of some of the nuclear
missiles on its territory.
The growing strength of the pro-nuclear lobby in the Ukrainian parliament
comes at a time when the fledgling nation is facing a double political
threat: mounting tensions with Russia and an increasingly volatile domestic
political climate.

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday formally applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade while denying it was endangering foreign aid and investment flows.
President Boris Yeltsin, who has launched market reforms that have sought to
open up the Russian economy to the outside world, told Mr Arthur Dunkel,
Gatt's outgoing secretary-general, that he hoped for admission by the end of
this year.
While Mr Dunkel remained politely non-committal, Mr Georgy Gabunia, a deputy
Russian trade minister, admitted he thought it would take Russia at least
two to three years to join.
Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for
foreign economic relations, denied reports that the International Monetary
Fund wanted to delay disbursing the first Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 980m) of a
systemic transformation facility promised for the end of June because Moscow
was lagging behind with promised reforms. 'We have not deviated from
schedule in our relations with the IMF. . . So far the IMF has every reason
to fulfil its obligations.'
Mr Shokhin also defended a ban for the month of June on the export of oil by
foreign joint ventures, which has been a fresh blow to Russia's attempts to
attract foreign investment, claiming it was simply an attempt to force
companies to prove that the oil they exported was really produced by them.
While joint ventures are sometimes used as a channel for illegal oil
exports, the explanation sounded more like an improvisation, since the ban
affects all joint ventures without discrimination between those which have
provided information requested by the government and those which have not.
Mr Shokhin also called on the US to drop its opposition to an Dollars 80m
contract for Russia to supply India with rocket technology for satellite
launches, saying Russia had little to lose from sanctions threatened by the
US.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Germany in EC row over US sanctions
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was at the centre of a potentially damaging EC row yesterday after
the European Commission demanded an explanation for Bonn's apparent refusal
to implement trade sanctions against the US, which the 12 agreed unanimously
on Tuesday.
In Bonn, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, confirmed that
Germany would not apply discriminatory sanctions against US companies. But
he firmly rejected accusations that Germany was violating EC law.
Commission lawyers were last night writing to the German government seeking
full clarification, as Brussels underlined that Bonn was in danger of
breaching Community law and loyalty.
'We're getting conflicting signals out of Bonn,' said an aide to Sir Leon
Brittan, the trade commissioner. 'They haven't made clear what they're
doing,' he added.
'If confirmed, any bilateral agreement of such a kind would be illegal under
Community law,' the Commission said in a tough statement.
The row centres on government telecommunications contracts. The US last
month imposed a ban on bids from EC companies for Dollars 20m worth of
public procurement contracts, alleging discrimination against American
companies in the European market. EC foreign ministers on Tuesday retaliated
with a Dollars 15m sanctions package against the US.
The US objects to Article 29 of the EC's utilities directive, which entered
into law in January, and gives a 3 per cent price preference to EC companies
bidding for any government contract. The article is there as a bargaining
chip to get the US to dismantle its 'Buy American' legislation in public
procurement. In April the two sides reached partial agreement on public
contracts.
The intra-EC row, so far confined to Brussels and Bonn, broke out after Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told a US congressional committee on
Thursday night that Germany and the US had agreed to drop sanctions.
Brussels yesterday warned Bonn it would be taken to court if it failed to
put Article 29 on Germany's statute book, and that it was also obliged to
stand by the sanctions agreement it signed this week.
Some Brussels officials suspect Washington of 'divide-and-rule' tactics. But
they are also concerned that Germany will be weakened as a counterweight to
France.
The German economics ministry says it is bound by a 1954 friendship treaty
with the US which forbids trade discrimination. The Commission flatly
rejected this argument last night, pointing out that Article 234 of the EC's
Treaty of Rome says that member states 'shall take all appropriate steps to
eliminate the incompatibilities' with previous undertakings. The Treaty 'is
as clear as a bell and overrides previous agreements,' the aide to Sir Leon
said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / State plans to tighten up on free market in vodka
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government said yesterday it would reimpose a state monopoly on
the production, storage and sale of vodka, the country's national drink, and
other spirits as part of efforts 'to restore order in the country and
society at large'.
A spokesman told Itar-Tass news agency that President Boris Yeltsin would
soon sign a decree prompted by concern over an increase of poisoning cases
from both Russian and imported spirits. He said this was 'far from the last'
of several measures being undertaken by the government to restore poryadok -
the favourite Russian word for law and order in everyday life.
The production and sale of vodka has traditionally been a state monopoly in
Russia, both under the tsars, and under 70 years of Communist rule. It has
been a big source of revenue for the state treasury throughout the
centuries.
But since liberalising both domestic trade and imports a year and a half
ago, the country has been flooded with foreign vodka and other spirits.
Russia's own state producers are unable to meet demand, and bottles of
locally produced vodka have been increasingly found to be diluted or
otherwise tampered with. Tax collectors have seen very little of the profits
from the increased sales, much of which are conducted by street kiosks which
do not even have cash-registers.
Rather than to chase away the bottles of Smirnoff and other foreign-produced
spirits now on sale, the spokesman suggested that the main aim of the decree
was to enforce state certification of drinks to ensure they were up to
standard.
But with hundreds of brands of alcoholic drinks sold at thousands of kiosks
all around Moscow, the authorities are unlikely to be able to implement the
decree, at least in the capital. More likely, it will provide a great
cash-spinning opportunity for officials and police to levy bribes not to
enforce it.

The Bank of Italy yesterday cut its official discount rate by 0.5 percentage
point to 10.5 per cent at the end of a week which has seen continued
weakness for the D-Mark against European currencies, writes James Blitz.
Announcing the move, the Italian central bank said it would take effect from
Monday and that its Lombard rate would also come down 50 basis points to 11
per cent. The move is the latest indication that European countries are not
waiting for the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates before deciding to ease
their own monetary policies.

Europe's national broadcasters can go on using their collective power when
bidding for the rights to televise big sporting events, the European
Commission decided yesterday, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. The
Commission has exempted the European Broadcasting Union, which groups 67
national broadcasters, from EC competition rules until February 1998 when
bidding for sports events. But the EBU has pledged to allow non-member
channels - including purely commercial broadcasters - access to sports
programmes on reasonable terms.
The Commission had been under pressure to open up the market for TV rights
to sporting events, after The European Sports Network (TESN), owner of the
Screensport channel, complained about the EBU's privileged position in 1987.

THE European Community will have to wait until 1995 for a real economic
recovery, Mr Henning Christopherson, EC economic commissioner, said
yesterday, Lionel Barber reports from Rome. In one of his gloomiest
forecasts to date, Mr Christopherson said unemployment could reach 12 per
cent in 1993-94, higher than the peak jobless rate in 1985. Addressing the
Association for the Monetary Commission of Europe, the Danish commissioner
ruled out re-opening the Maastricht treaty's criteria for European monetary
union to take account of rising unemployment.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, president of Fiat, accused the EC of a 'gutless lack of
ideals' and called for an inner group of core currencies to move to monetary
union. This would create a vital benchmark and would make a 'significant
contribution to a further drop in European interest rates,' he said.

Scientists at a top nuclear weapons centre in Russia have complained of
'degrading' conditions and warned leaders in Moscow that falling standards
could lead to a Chernobyl-type disaster, according to Itar-Tass news agency,
Reuter reports.
Scientists at the Arzamas-16 nuclear facility told the leaders in an open
letter that Russia could not afford to take short cuts in financing work on
nuclear weapons safety, because of the vast costs that would be involved in
the event of an accident.
The scientists, who complained earlier this week they had not yet got their
wages for April and May, said degrading working conditions could lead to
nuclear specialists leaving Russia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE would-be 'king makers' of the German political system, members of the
little Free Democratic Party, were yesterday summoned to crown their own
prince. Like all the best coronations, the outcome was never in serious
doubt. But the atmosphere was a little subdued.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, former civil servant, one-time head of Germany's secret
service, and now the foreign minister, was the only name on the ballot paper
for the party leadership.
It was all too much for at least one angry delegate at the annual party
conference in Munster: it reminded him of the bad old days in East Germany's
Communist Party, he declared. But the celebrations had to go on.
The party which made - and broke - the ruling coalitions of the 1960s, 1970s
and 1980s, is struggling to keep its head above the German electoral water.
In opting for Mr Kinkel, who has been a party member for barely two years,
it is gambling on a fresh face and a man renowned for often undiplomatic
plain speaking.
The FDP still plays a key role in the ruling coalition in Bonn, way beyond
its national support of barely 8 per cent. But electoral arithmetic suggest
that a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social
Democrats is a much more likely outcome at next year's elections.
Both the big parties are languishing with support at around 35 per cent. If
the FDP cannot break through the 10 per cent barrier, it cannot offer either
the prospect of a parliamentary majority in a coalition.
Mr Kinkel knows that all too well. Today he will set out his strategy to
break the electoral deadlock.
As for the man who might have been king, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former
economics minister who was forced to resign in January over a silly scandal,
he did his best to put a brave face on the occasion.
He made one last bid to keep the role of 'king maker'. He called on Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, and still the real
power behind the party throne, to accept a nomination as German state
president next year.
It was not to be. Perhaps it is all part of the inscrutable tactics of the
man who remains Germany's most popular politician. But yesterday Mr Genscher
was adamant. He is not available as a candidate for the presidency.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday declined to make a firm commitment to contribute troops for
the protection of the six Moslem enclaves designated in Bosnia, though it
said it was in principle in favour of such a move.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said during a meeting of
the 34-nation Nato Co-operation Council, grouping the western allies and the
former Soviet and east European states, that Russia wanted a clearer
definition of the mandate for the deployment of Russian troops in Bosnia
before it could take such a decision.
Mr Kozyrev said in an interview with American television that before Russia
could send troops to Bosnia, 'we need a much clearer definition of the
mandate from the Security Council. . . a definition of what these troops
would do.'
Russia already has troops serving under the United Nations banner in
Croatia, but is clearly digging in its heels on sending troops to Bosnia
because of the opposition of powerful conservative political forces and the
Russian military to what they consider essentially an anti-Serb measure.
The reluctance of the Russians, which comes on top of the US's refusal to
offer ground troops for the protection of the Moslem safe areas, must be
considered a serious setback to international efforts to ensure the defence
of the enclaves.
However, Thursday's decision by the Nato Council to provide warplanes to
counter any attacks on UN troops protecting the safe areas at least
partially offsets the adverse consequences of the lack of a sufficient
number of ground troops.
The absence of firm ground troop offers from some of the most important
western and eastern nations did not prevent the Co-operation Council from
fully endorsing the joint action programme adopted by the US, Russia,
France, the UK and Spain in Washington last month, under which the safe
areas are being set up.
It also fully endorsed the decision by the Nato Council taken 24 hours
earlier to provide protective air power in case of attack against UN forces
in Bosnia in the performance of their mandate.
At the opening of the meeting, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general,
warned of the dangers Europe faced from ethnic violence after the Cold War.
'The war in the former Yugoslavia has shown a growing gap between our
hopeful vision of a new security order and the tragic reality of ethnic
violence,' he said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Patching a tattered policy: Aid for Bosnian Moslem enclaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL ATTEMPTS by the west to patch up its tattered Bosnian policy have merely
underlined the increasingly obvious absence of an overall plan for a durable
peace settlement.
Lip-service is still paid to the ill-fated Vance-Owen plan as the basis for
an eventual negotiated settlement guaranteeing 'the full sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence' of Bosnia-Hercegovina, as
it was in the latest final communique of the Nato Foreign Ministers' Council
in Athens. But hardly any governments believe this is still a realistic
proposition.
Instead, the western nations are involved in a damage limitation exercise
aimed essentially at masking their own failure to come up with effective
measures that would make it possible to translate their avowed political
objective of an independent and united Bosnia into practice.
That exercise, by their own admission, involves temporary measures, such as
the setting up of Moslem 'safe areas' in Bosnia which, far from contributing
to a peace settlement, risk exacerbating an already inflammatory situation
on the ground.
Lord Owen, the European Community's representative on the two-man
international mediating team, has talked recently of a 'serious
unscrambling' of the United Nations sponsored peace initiative, mainly as
the result of the so-called 'joint action programme' adopted by the US,
Russia, the UK, France and Spain in Washington on May 22.
One of the essential provisions of that agreement is the setting up of six
safe areas in Bosnia, within which the Moslem population would be protected
by the presence of troops from the UN Protection Force (Unprofor).
Unfortunately, as Lord Owen has pointed out, the perception of the warring
parties in Bosnia was that the five western nations were accepting the fait
accompli of territory acquired by force, in the first place by the Serbs.
That, in turn, encouraged the Bosnian Croats in the Mostar region to take
more territory from the Moslems, with the inevitable result that the Moslems
have launched counter-attacks on the Croats, their one-time allies, with
considerable success and much additional human suffering.
So the net result of the Washington agreement has been more fighting and
atrocities, with the ultimate objective of a negotiated settlement appearing
even more unattainable than it did before. Yet even in these circumstances
the setting up of safe areas might have proved acceptable to international
opinion as a desirable interim measure if the western nations had been able
to agree on all the practical steps to make them viable.
The jury is still out on the final verdict, but the evidence submitted by
the west so far on the strength of its commitment to the setting up the safe
areas and on other parts of the Washington agreement, such as the placing of
international monitors on the Serbian-Bosnian border to supervise sactions,
is far from conclusive.
Having been thwarted by its allies in its original desire to undertake
punitive air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs and to supply arms to their
Moslem adversaries, the US has proved extremely reluctant to become more
directly involved in the Bosnian crisis. By declining to provide ground
troops to protect the Moslem enclaves, while several of its European allies
such as France, Britain and Spain already have troops on the ground, the US
exposed a serious rift in the western position.
It gave the impression, not only to its allies, but to the warring parties
in Bosnia, that it was not prepared to match its good intentions with deeds.
At the same time, the Serbs will have noted a similar reluctance on the part
of the European nations already involved in Bosnia to step up their own
commitments of troops.
The decision by the Nato Council in Athens on Thursday to offer military
planes to protect UN forces around the Moslem enclaves and elsewhere in
Bosnia against attack was an attempt both to paper over the cracks in the
western alliance and to counter the original signals of western
unwillingness to act in Bosnia sent to Belgrade.
By joining France, Britain, the Netherlands and Turkey in offering aircraft
for these operations, and by offering to provide 300 ground troops to join
the UN peace-keeping contingent already in Macedonia, the US has tried to
repair the damage - with what effect still remains to be seen.
The fact is that air power will be used only to protect UN troops against
attack and will not be called upon to defend Moslem civilians against attack
if no UN troops are involved. Serbs and Croats will continue to be allowed
to grab Moslem territory and pillage with impunity as long as they keep out
of the way of UN troops. That is an important distinction which will hardly
reassure the long-suffering Moslem population of Bosnia.
Among all the squabbling and haggling over stop-gap solutions, and the
occasional cries of victory when agreement is finally reached on the type of
temporary sticking plaster to be applied to the gaping wound, sight is
rapidly being lost by the west of the end result it wants to achieve.
Safe areas, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, said earlier
this week, were not a magic solution. 'They are only a temporary, first step
aimed at keeping people alive.' But those who are being kept alive are
desperately looking for signs that the western powers have some idea of the
long-term future which awaits the Moslems of Bosnia outside their extended
refugee camps, which is all that the enclaves are destined to become.
Judging by the results of the EC and Nato meetings in Luxembourg and Athens
over the past few days, they will have to wait a long time for their answer.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Kuwait move causes big fall in oil price

OIL PRICES tumbled yesterday following Kuwait's refusal to agree to restrain
its output in coming months in accordance with a deal struck late on
Thursday by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Ministers meeting in Geneva had agreed to maintain their current production
ceiling of 23.6m barrels a day for the third quarter. But Mr Ali Ahmed
al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, said the emirate would increase its
production.
North Sea Brent crude fell 65 cents to Dollars 17.80 a barrel as traders
reacted to an expected rush of supply to the market.
Kuwait is planning to raise its production to 2m b/d from 1.6m b/d over the
next three months and Mr al-Baghli has indicated it could reach 2.16m b/d by
the end of September. But he said Kuwait would not flood the market and is
not looking to depress prices.
'It's not as bad for the market as it looks,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil
analyst with UBS in London. 'Politically, it's a terrible agreement, but
commercially it won't be so awful.'
Most Opec producers are pumping oil at close to their full capacity which
will stop them over-producing. Others, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, are
keen to see firmer prices. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister said
yesterday the kingdom will stick to its quota under the agreement. 'If
everybody adheres, we think the market will stabilise,' he said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Trade gap widens to Pounds 4.5bn: Export growth slows
sharply despite benefits of sterling devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST complete set of UK trade figures since the beginning of the year
yesterday revealed the biggest quarterly trade gap since 1990 and prompted
fears that recession in continental Europe, combined with domestic recovery,
would bring about a sharp deterioration in Britain's trade position.
The provisional figures showed that the visible trade gap widened to Pounds
4.5bn in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 4.35bn in the final quarter
of 1992. The underlying deficit - which excludes oil and erratic items - was
also the biggest shortfall for three years at Pounds 5.2bn, compared with
Pounds 4.89bn in the previous quarter.
The deficit on trade with other countries in the European Community,
however, was not as large as expected. New figures compiled under Intrastat
 -a system for measuring EC trade flows in line with the single market -
showed a deficit of Pounds 1.1bn in the first three months of the year,
slightly lower than the Pounds 1.12bn of the previous three-month period.
In spite of the competitive edge given to British-made goods by sterling's
devaluation last autumn, the growth of export volumes slowed considerably,
reflecting the recession in other EC countries.
The Central Statistical Office said underlying export volumes rose by only
0.5 per cent quarter-on quarter, while import volumes rose by 3 per cent.
The CSO said the trade figures were more than usually likely to be revised,
since Intrastat was taking some months to settle down.
Economists said the overall deterioration in the trade deficit was limited
by a sharp jump in the prices of exports, compared with a more modest rise
for import prices. Export prices rose by 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter,
against import price rises of 4 per cent.
Mr Robert Lind of the Swiss bank UBS said: 'The numbers are consistent with
the view that the deficit will deteriorate as recovery gathers pace. They
also cast doubt over the Treasury's optimistic view of net-trade volumes
this year.'
The value of total exports in the first quarter was a provisional Pounds
29.6bn, 7 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. Import values
totalled Pounds 34.1bn, also 7 per cent up on the previous three month
period.
The Treasury pointed out that in spite of the slowdown in export volume
growth, exports nevertheless reached record levels in the first quarter. It
said: 'UK businesses now have a great opportunity in markets both at home
and abroad.'
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the figures
revealed 'just how sickly' the economy was. 'What is most worrying is that
with the single market only three months old, our deficit with the EC was
twice as bad as it was for the same period last year,' he said.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Governor of Bank to leave with a peerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, outgoing governor of the Bank of England, is one
of four life peers created in today's Queen's Birthday honours list. Another
is Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the academic and writer.
Mr Samuel Brittan, the Financial Times's principal economic commentator and
an assistant editor, receives a knighthood for services to economic
journalism. Mr David Buchan, head of the FT's Paris bureau, receives an OBE
for services to journalism.
Today's list reflects a further stage of Mr John Major's incremental reform
of the honours system to give greater recognition to voluntary and community
service. It includes honours for those involved in humanitarian relief work
in former Yugoslavia.
Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, who commanded British troops in Bosnia, was
awarded a Distinguished Service Order.
The greater emphasis on a wider contribution to the community was
highlighted in some of the awards to those in business and commerce, as well
as those for charitable services.
Among those receiving knighthoods were Mr Robin Biggam, chairman of BICC,
the cable and construction group; Mr Ronald Miller, chairman of Dawson
International, the textile group and Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive of
Halifax Building Society.
While this is the first list in which the British Empire Medal - the lowest
grade of honour - does not appear, other reforms promised by Mr Major in
March will have to await future lists.
The New Year's honours list will be the first for which people can write in
to the prime minister's office to nominate someone. So far more than 10,000
nomination forms have been sent out and 6,000 have been returned. The
proportion of awards to state servants was broadly in line with previous
lists, though Downing Street said that now no official was nominated
automatically.
Political honours, however, were distributed at Westminster rather more
sparsely than usual. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, and Sir George
Young, housing minister, both become privy counsellors, but only two
Conservative backbenchers, Mr Ralph Howell and Mr David Knox, receive
knighthoods.
Among the customary awards to artists and entertainers are the other two
life peers: Sir Richard Attenborough, the actor and film director, and Sir
Yehudi Menuhin, the violinist and conductor. Miss Thora Hird, the actress,
and Miss Muriel Spark, the author, both become Dames.
Mr Nicholas Colchester, deputy editor of the Economist and former foreign
editor of the FT, receives an OBE for services to journalism.
In what may be a sign of the times, relatively few awards went to
footballers and cricketers. Mr Andy Roxburgh, the Scottish football team
manager receives the OBE. Mr Ray Wilkins, the former England soccer player,
receives the MBE as does Mr Harold Larwood, a fast bowler who last played
for England in the controversial 1932-33 'Bodyline' Ashes series against
Australia.

FT  12 JUN 93 / Stop squabbles, Major tells warring Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS AND ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LLANGOLLEN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ended a tumultuous week for the government by urging
Conservatives to stop squabbling and to rebuild British voters' trust with a
message based on ordinary people's aspirations - particularly on jobs.
As the Tory hierarchy tried, with partial success, to restore calm after Mr
Norman Lamont's bitter resignation speech, the prime minister marked a
further shift away from Thatcherism.
He told the Welsh Conservative party conference that Tories should 'put
aside the great designs and philosophies'.
They had to go 'into the living-room of the three-bed, semi-detached house'
to 'understand what it is the people actually want'. In the 1980s, he said,
'we were just a touch too laissez-faire'.
Mr Major buttressed his proclaimed commitment to enduring Tory party values
 -and to rebuff the former chancellor's complaints about short-termism - by
stressing the importance of sound money and low inflation and hinting that
he is keen to avoid tax rises.
Britain, he said, would not become a high-tech, high investment economy 'if
we pile on taxes and pile on social costs'. Public spending had to be cut,
but some radical proposals would be discarded as unfair, he predicted.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will next week reinforce the emphasis on
public spending restraint by telling the cabinet that there can be no
question of breaching the ceilings set for the next two years.
Despite bids running several billions of pounds above the figures agreed
last autumn, Mr Clarke will ask for a remit from the cabinet to seek a
settlement this summer below the Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn cash
ceilings for 1994-95 and 1995-96.
The political difficulties of achieving such a result were underlined again
yesterday, with a renewed row over the prospects of billions of pounds in
savings on the social security budget by the end of the century.
Mr Clarke, who this week emphasised his commitment to nurturing the
recovery, will also use an important speech in the City to reaffirm the
Treasury's commitment to its 1 to 4 per cent inflation target.
Separately, Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said that he wanted to 'draw
a line' under his deeply personalised row this week with Mr Lamont.
That emphasis on unity and loyalty was echoed by senior ministers, including
Mr Douglas Hurd. Speaking In Gloucestershire, the foreign secretary urged
Conservatives to reject the option of 'flap and scrap, posture and panic'
and to focus on the realities.
Mr Hurd last night ruled himself out as a possible challenger for the Tory
party leadership. The foreign secretary, a candidate in the last leadership
election, told BBC 2's Newsnight programme: 'I had my one and only go and I
don't regret that but I am not going to be in that business again.'

FT  12 JUN 93 / Top US aero-engine makers join forces against Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO leading US aero-engine manufacturers, General Electric and Pratt and
Whitney, are joining forces for the first time to challenge Rolls-Royce of
the UK in the market for smaller jet engines to power regional and business
jets.
GE and Pratt and Whitney announced yesterday at the Paris Air Show that they
had agreed to work jointly with MTU, the German aero-engine company owned by
Deutsche Aerospace, and Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine group.
The four companies will develop a family of engines with a thrust range from
12,000lb to 20,000lb to compete against the joint engine company formed two
years ago by Rolls-Royce and BMW, the German car group.
The two US companies, which have both restructured in the past 12 months and
are the main competitors of Rolls-Royce, have traditionally competed
fiercely in the commercial and military engine markets.
The move reflects a growing trend towards partnerships in the hard-pressed
aerospace industry and follows Boeing's decision to co-operate in joint
studies with the partners in the European Airbus consortium on development
of a super jumbo aircraft.
By teaming with the two European companies, the US manufacturers hope to
reduce the lead Rolls-Royce and BMW have taken in the development of smaller
jet engines. BMW-Rolls-Royce has already won orders for its new BR700 engine
from Gulfstream and the Canadian Bombardier group. The engine is expected to
enter service in 1996.
GE had been studying the development of a smaller jet engine with Snecma,
the CFM88, based on the military engine Snecma has developed for the French
Rafale fighter aircraft. GE and Snecma have a long and successful history of
co-operation in commercial jet engines.
Pratt and Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies, already has a
wide-ranging alliance with MTU, with which it has been studying joint
development of a similar power plant, the RTF180.
However, the market lead held by BMW and Rolls-Royce prompted the companies
to combine forces. As well as competing to power regional jet and business
aircraft, they see sales potential for engines to power a new European
military transport.
'There was clearly no room for three competing engine programmes in this
market - that's why the four companies decided to team up,' said Mr Georges
Sangis, Snecma's head of commercial engine programmes. He said the cost of
developing the new engine family would total about Dollars 700m (Pounds
455m).
BMW and Rolls-Royce originally sought to attract MTU and Snecma into an
all-European engine partnership.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Colonials' victory secures a corner on sports pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT DID NOT quite make the front pages, but at least it made the front page
of the sports sections, which soccer rarely does and especially not on
mornings after the finish of ice hockey's finals, the first round of
basketball's championship series and a full major league baseball schedule.
The New York Times even thought it worthy of wry humour. Its skyline read:
'In another upset, Colonials 2, Red Coats 0.' Just in case the point was
missed, its story of the match was headlined; 'Redcoats in Massachusetts?
You already know the result.'
Other newspapers were a little more prosaic about the US victory over
England's soccer team in Foxboro, just down the road from Lexington where
the 'first shot around the world' - the start of the American Revolution -
was heard in 1775.
The Washington Post's historical comparison could only reach back as far as
1989 to the great US triumph in the World Cup qualifying competition over
mighty Trinidad and Tobago. But even to raise that equally epochal US
performance must have hurt the English.
Of course, there were many references to the 1950 US victory over England in
Belo Horizonte, but that was an achievement far more burned in infamy in
English recollections than in the American sporting consciousness.
After all, in 1950 Ted Williams was still in his prime and Jackie Robinson,
the first black in major league baseball, was capturing the national
imagination.
But this was also matched by simple amazement about the Wednesday result;
after all this is a US team whose record in its last 15 matches, several
against Caribbean and Central American teams, was a miserable single win
(against Saudi Arabia), five losses and nine draws; it had failed to score
in nearly 400 minutes play.
Soccer has had a hard time re-establishing itself in the US since Pele hung
up his boots for the New York Cosmos 15 years ago. But, as host of next
year's World Cup, the US soccer establishment is at least trying and a
victory over England can do no harm.
But the competition for attention on Wednesday night was unusually severe.
The last round of the Stanley Cup saw the Montreal Canadiens beat the Los
Angeles Kings 4-1. The US is a bit ambivalent about ice hockey, but not
about its luminous star, Wayne Gretzky, whose last game this may have been.
Far exceeding that was the titanic first round clash in basketball, in which
the Chicago Bulls beat the Phoenix Suns.
This, too, was portrayed as the ultimate confrontation between two
shaven-headed nonpareils - Michael 'Air' Jordan and 'Sir' Charles Barkley.
In addition, the Baltimore Orioles - the nearest major league baseball team
to Washington - have suddenly woken up. Thus the telecast of the US-England
game only appeared on the deliciously named Home Team Sports cable station
after the Os had put it to the (Oakland) As.
Your correspondent, channel-surfing all night, confesses to have fallen
asleep within five minutes of the Foxboro kickoff.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Italian kickback cash is found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PALERMO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN magistrates have located L50bn (Dollars 34.22m) of assets allegedly
coming from kickbacks paid to Mr Giuseppe Parrella, the ex-managing director
of ASST, the former state telecommunications agency.
This is the largest single amount found by magistrates in the corruption
scandals and was revealed by a senior official in the ministry of posts.
One of the most puzzling aspects for the magistrates investigating the
corruption scandals is the extent to which money collected has been spent or
retained - and if retained in the name of inviduals for their own benefit or
that of the political parties for whom the funds were notionally collected.
Of the total, L30bn has been found in cash in offshore accounts in Vaduz,
and L7bn in property investments in the northern city of Udine.
In another development two new foreign companies became involved in the
corruption scandals with the announcement by Milan magistrates one executive
from Philips and another from Bull had been arrested in connection with
alleged kickbacks on contracts supplying to equipment to the justice
ministry.
Italian police struck twice at the Mafia yesterday arresting two top
associates of a detained crime boss and swooping on dozens more suspects,
Reuter adds from Palermo.
Police said they arrested Raffaele Ganci and his son Calogero, alleged to be
close aides of suspected boss of bosses Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina.
Mr Riina was arrested in January after 23 years on the run and since then
police have scored several coups in the fight against the Mafia, helped by a
growing number of informers.
In a separate anti-Mafia operation centred around Milan and the southern
region of Puglia, police made dozens of arrests and served fresh warrants on
scores more in jail.
Most were suspected of Mafia association.
In Milan, magistrates ordered police to detain more than 100 people for
questioning. Some inmates of jails in northern Italy were served new
warrants to delay their scheduled release pending further investigation.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Brussels turns its thoughts to the deprived: Alan Pike looks
at 'symbolic' moves by the EC in an area traditionally looked after by
member states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has embarked on a
bid to double the level of expenditure on the EC's main programme for
supporting poor and deprived citizens.
Official estimates compiled before the recession put the number of people in
poverty in the EC - defined as those with access to less than half their
national average income - at 50m. Unofficial estimates suggest the current
figure could be as high as 70m. So even if member states agree to spend
Ecu110m (Dollars 132m) on a new five-year anti-poverty programme, it will
still be only a drop in the ocean.
The move, however, signals a cautious but determined raising of the stakes
in an attempt to involve the EC in the social stability of Europe's
marginalised citizens.
At the turn of the year, the Commission produced 'Towards a Europe of
Solidarity', a document proposing ways of 'intensifying the fight against
social exclusion and fostering integration.' This acknowledged that the
Community could not assume member states' responsibilities for attacking
social exclusion - the EC's favoured umbrella term for combined effects of
material and social deprivation. But it envisaged an EC role in transferring
know-how and developing concerted initiatives at European level.
The Commission's agenda, even in such carefully stated terms, still raised
the UK government's suspicions. A Department of Social Security memorandum
commenting on the report says that it 'could be taken to imply that there
should be an EC strategy to deal with social exclusion.' The British
government, says the memorandum, 'believes strongly on subsidiarity grounds
that the appropriate level of response to social exclusion is that of the
member state.' While the Commission document did not explicitly breach the
subsidiary principle 'any practical proposals which flow from it will
require close examination.'
The practical proposals began flowing at a conference in Copenhagen this
month when Mr Delors, in addition to saying he would seek a doubling of
funds for local-level anti-poverty programmes supported by the EC, came up
with ideas for solemn declarations against poverty and a 'passport' setting
out the rights and services to which Europe's disadvantaged citizens should
be entitled.
While the ideas are largely symbolic, they will add to critics' worries  -
and supporters' hopes - that Mr Delors and Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs
commissioner, are indeed trying to build an EC strategy on social exclusion.
Although the EC has supported small-scale anti-poverty initiatives for more
than 10 years, its main ventures into social policy have from the earliest
days been directed at people in employment. Mr Flynn will, in this
tradition, publish a green paper proposing new human resources and training
initiatives shortly.
But he acknowledges the concerns of anti-poverty campaigners that, if the
focus of EC social funding is always on those in employment or facing
redundancy, the needs of the long-term unemployed poor will become ever more
distant from community thinking.
If finding an acceptable basis for even advancing discussion of poverty
issues at EC level is difficult, the problems themselves are daunting. There
was widespread concern among academics, voluntary workers and
representatives from the EC's regions at the Copenhagen conference that,
even with faster economic growth, insufficient jobs will be created to
rescue the excluded through increased employment opportunities alone - the
OECD predicts that there will be 23m unemployed in its European member
states by the end of next year, compared with 8.5m in the US and 1.7m in
Japan.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (17): Dressed up with nowhere to go -
The problems facing the tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEM facing the South African tourism industry was aptly illustrated
last month by the state president, Mr FW de Klerk, when he opened the
Indaba, the annual tourism marketing forum, in Durban.
He started his speech by quoting a famous passage from Alan Paton's novel
Cry the Beloved Country, the most well known book written about South
Africa:
'There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into the hills. These hills are
grass covered and rolling and they are lovely beyond the singing of it.'
As Mr de Klerk noted, Ixopo is not far from Durban. Sadly, 'those same
rolling hills, and some other parts of our country are now scenes of
violence'. Having shaken off the stigma of apartheid, the tourism industry
now finds itself saddled with the stigma of violence.
That is the perception: it matters little that most of the country is
untouched by violence.
Although figures supplied by the South African Tourism Board (Satour) show
that foreign visitors increased last year by 7.4 per cent to 560,000
(excluding 2.1m visitors from Africa), this was a long way short of the 20
per cent growth hoped for.
The Indaba itself provided confirmation of hard times in the industry. The
corridors of the huge exhibition hall were hardly bustling and many
participants said business was quiet. It was very much a case of an industry
all dressed up with nowhere to go.
To be fair, economic recession is also an important factor. Indeed, some in
the trade argue that it is a more important determinant of business activity
than violence.
One such person was Mr Nick Seewer, general manager of the prestigious Mount
Nelson hotel in Cape Town. He said the hotel was doing very well, had had
its best April in years, and summer bookings were good.
He made the point that seasoned travellers, of the sort that frequent his
sort of establishment, know South Africa and are not easily put off.
Lower down the market, however, the pinch is being felt. Mr Helder Pereira,
operations director of Southern Suns, the country's largest hotel group,
confirms a 25 per cent increase in cancellations after the assassination in
April of Chris Hani, the black political leader.
Whether stability will bring the riches the industry feels it deserves -
'our fair share of the market' - is another matter.
Tourism only accounts for about 2 per cent of South Africa's GDP compared to
an international average of 6 per cent. Clearly there is enormous potential
for growth given that the quality of the product is not in dispute, and
Satour has set targets of 966,000 annual foreign visitors by 1995 and 1.75m
by 2000.
Stability alone, however, will not see these targets realised. Recent
surveys show declining consumer satisfaction in areas such as 'value for
money' and service. These shortcomings need to be rectified if South Africa
is to establish itself as a competitive, user-friendly destination.
On the other hand, tourism can only benefit from the increased priority it
now enjoys with government. A new ministry, solely responsible for tourism,
has been established; a White Paper, outlining the development of the
industry has been published and deregulation continues (evident in the
dramatic increase in the number of international carriers flying to the
country, from 19 in 1990 to 36 in 1993).
All these steps augur well for the future.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (16): Gap between negotiators remains
wide - Andrew Gowers and Michael Holman travel from Sebokeng to Tuynhuys to
discover where the real power will lie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SETTLER] Settler]' The group of youngsters chants derisively as our car
passes them before drawing up outside Sebokeng's delapidated post office.
Thabo Mothopeng, local chairman of the ANC Youth League, welcomes us with a
grin: 'Have you come to look for disillusioned youth?'
The sprawling black township 25 miles from Johannesburg is in the front line
of the struggle for change in South Africa. If Nelson Mandela cannot carry
his young urban constituents along with him in his pursuit of power, any
settlement he signs will be a fragile affair.
So far at least, the ANC leader's pragmatism is supported by Mothopeng and
his colleagues. Their slogan for 1993 - 'the year of no nonsense' - reflects
sound civic sense: they support the negotiations, and look forward to a new
government that will tar Sebokeng's dusty, potholed roads, introduce
electricity, build clinics and schools, and crack down on crime. 'This is a
nice location, really,' says one 'comrade' wistfully, surveying the rows of
box-like houses, the regimented effect softened by the occasional tidy lawn.
The ANC has divided Sebokeng into blocks and given them revolutionary names.
We start in Namibia and drive through Libya and Palestine. Stopping in
Angola, we gather with Youth League members in the local bar-cum-nightclub.
All agree that a government of national unity is a good thing - provided the
ANC is in charge. 'The party which wins chooses the other parties,' asserts
one. Would the cabinet include non-ANC ministers? Certainly room should be
found for Pik Botha, South Africa's long-serving foreign minister: 'His
experience is needed.' Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi? Heads shake in
disapproval. FW de Klerk? Mothopeng grimaces.
Twenty-four hours later and 1,000 miles away in his Tuynhuys residence in
Cape Town, President de Klerk provides a very different interpretation of a
coalition government. He envisages an inner cabinet of the main party
leaders who take decisions on 'fundamental issues' by consensus. 'We believe
that all major parties must play a fundamental role,' he says. 'I have no
doubt that my party will be one of those.'
The gulf between Sebokeng and Tuynhuys is the essence of South Africa's
political crisis. Time and again, during two weeks of interviews around the
country, the conversation returned to this critical difference on the
meaning of power-sharing between black and white.
Roelf Meyer is one of the men charged with bridging it. A quietly-spoken,
courteous young Afrikaner, he is the chief government negotiator in the
multi-party talks at Johannesburg's World Trade Centre. But in spite of his
close personal rapport with his ANC opposite number, Cyril Ramaphosa, he is
constrained by his constituency. Meyer stresses that a coalition or
government of national unity is not a matter of 'co-opting parties, but real
power sharing.' What does this mean in practice? 'This has still to be
thrashed out between Mandela and de Klerk. So far they have not addressed
the details.'
Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general, puts it quite differently: 'In a
government of national unity naturally an inner cabinet will evolve, where
deadlocks will be resolved.' But this does not mean he accepts de Klerk's
call for a formalised consensus: 'They haven't given up a white veto. But
they can never have it.'
Lest there is any doubt about the pressures Ramaphosa himself is under
within the ANC, Tokyo Sexwale, a regional chairman and one of its more
populist voices, provides a timely reminder. 'We've reached a situation
where the ANC doesn't have to call for action any more. These days the ANC
is beginning to run behind the people. It is a very explosive situation.'
Such warnings have their uses. No one in the ANC alliance has proved more
adept in turning them to negotiating advantage than Joe Slovo. Once the
leading bete noire of white South Africa, Communist leader Slovo now
commands a sneaking respect among his conference table adversaries, and
judges them shrewdly. 'There is a feeling of urgency about talks that wasn't
there a year ago,' he insists. The economy is in trouble, the government's
alliance with Inkatha has broken up, the National Party is divided: 'They
need a settlement. It's a question of survival - they have nowhere else to
run to.'
In the pressure to produce quick results, however, lies danger, as
independent observers of the talks anxiously underline. John Kane-Berman,
director of the Institute of Race Relations, cautions against rushing
headlong into a flawed settlement: 'There's a lot of talking up of this
process. I've always been worried about unrealistic deadlines' a reference
to the proposed April 1994 election date.
'What worries me is that you will have bilateral deals between certain
parties but the levels of violence in some areas of the country will make
elections there meaningless. But having set a deadline you will steam ahead
with elections and put the clamps on dissenters.'
Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, former liberal MP and academic, concurs that the
talks can give a false impression of progress: 'Every time they agree to put
something aside and not talk about it becomes a breakthrough. It's a
political farce. The ANC and the government are playing 'coup poker' - they
scare the hell out of each other and then find common ground. I find it very
difficult to see an elected national unity government in the next year -
more likely is a hybrid civilian-military agreement to stabilise the
situation with a self-appointed government of national unity endorsed by a
phoney referendum.'
But the most sombre assessment of all comes from a senior backroom member of
the ruling National Party, a man who has been at the heart of white South
Africa's move towards the negotiating table in the last decade: 'I have very
serious doubts about an election in a year's time because of the problem of
violence.'
This man, who prefers to remain anonymous, sees a dangerous decline in white
morale. 'The National Party has moved from holding a monopoly of power to
sharing power. The problem is that power sharing is not happening. The ANC
has to understand that we must retain whites in this country, not as a
subjected people but as a people with a stake in the new dispensation. The
only thing that stands between South Africa and the chaos that is the rest
of Africa is for enough people with skill and experience to keep it going to
stay around. They happen to be mostly white.'
Second only to power sharing as a bone of contention is the issue of how, or
whether, to accommodate Chief Buthelezi, the Zulu leader of the Inkatha
Freedom Party. Chief Buthelezi wants his provincial stronghold of Natal to
have its own assembly with a substantial degree of self-government,
something the ANC resists. Joe Matthews, one of his key negotiators,
believes the ANC is becoming more flexible on the issue: 'For the ANC power
is now that close - the overwhelming imperative is to get into government.
The details matter less.'
What worries the IFP, however - and what could still prompt it to walk out
of the talks - is the suspicion that the ANC and the government are pursuing
a hidden agenda which will in the end leave Chief Buthelezi high and dry. It
is a conspiracy theory shared by those on the extreme right and left of
South Africa's political spectrum.
'Decisions are being made for our people without their participation. We are
opposed to power-sharing because we don't know what it contains,' says
Johnson Mlambo, deputy-chairman of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).
Pieter Mulder, a leading Conservative Party MP, voices a similar sense of
frustration. And as the process unfolds, he says, the anger on the right can
only grow: 'The realities of the proposed solution are coming to the fore.
Up until now it was just rhetoric. The myth is that the election will solve
everything: you only have to look at Angola to see that violence is not
necessarily ended by an election.'
That, at least for some, is the grim reality that lies behind the optimism
so frequently expressed at the conference centre in Johannesburg. For all
their procedural progress, negotiators seem no closer to resolving the big
question: where in the new South Africa will the real power lie?
As long as Sebokeng and Tuynhuys offer such fundamentally different answers,
a lasting settlement seems out of reach.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (15): Society needs to be re-invented
 -Black economic empowerment is crucial to the success of democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I THINK it's extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material
stake in the country. We've got to see that people in the majority have as
large a share in the material assets of the country as we can.'
No one would disagree with Mr Harry Oppenheimer, patriarch of the South
African business community, when he argues that black economic empowerment
is crucial to the success of democracy in South Africa.
Whatever the moral arguments in favour of affirmative action - or the
utilitarian arguments against it - South Africa has no option but to tackle
the legacy of apartheid, which overwhelmingly prevented the entry of blacks
to the managerial and entrepreneurial classes.
The scale of the task is enormous: blacks have only a token presence on the
boards of leading quoted companies, top management is almost entirely white,
middle management is little better, and the country can boast only one large
black-owned company (National Sorghum Breweries, which manufactures sorghum
beer for the black market).
The recent sale of 10 per cent of the insurance company Metropolitan Life to
a black company, Methold - a deal which will give black investors effective
control over Metropolitan Life (see box) - is a mere drop in the ocean, says
Methold deputy-chairman Enos Mabuza.
Mr Oppenheimer envisages further such deals, modelled on the sale of General
Mining to Afrikaans business interests in the 1960s, a parallel attempt at
Afrikaner economic empowerment. But he notes: 'Of course, it's more
difficult to do than it was in the old days because largely they (the
blacks) haven't the capital to do it and very often they haven't the skills
to do it. But still, these things will grow: both the capital and the
skills.'
The Industrial Development Corporation, the state-owned body which provided
R137m to finance the MetLife deal, can help with the problem of capital, as
it did for the Afrikaner. But empowering a couple of million Afrikaners is
far cheaper than financing the advance of 28m blacks; and the skills problem
is acute.
That is South Africa's dilemma (the mirror image of the problem facing the
US over the past three decades): affirmative action must be applied to
advance the vast majority of the population, not just an ethnic minority.
And after decades of poor education and state barriers to black capital
formation (through regulations forbidding or restricting black business),
that majority departs from a very low base.
Not surprisingly, the prospect of black-led government has set black
expectations running high: the National African Federated Chamber of
Commerce, the black business federation, has demanded that all listed
companies have 30 per cent black board representation by 2000, that blacks
hold 40 per cent of equity and 60 per cent of posts at all management
levels.
The white business community can take comfort from the fact that the African
National Congress puts forward no such rigid (and unrealistic) quotas: the
head of the ANC economics department, Mr Trevor Manuel, says the idea of
legislating affirmative action 'goes against the grain' (though it is still
under debate). The ANC's goal is to 'raise consciousness on the issue, try
to develop systems which may be appropriate' (words which will scarcely
frighten business), though affirmative action must be pursued with vigour in
the civil service, which is overwhelmingly dominated by Afrikaners who could
easily frustrate ANC political objectives.
But business knows that its best option is to undertake pre-emptive action
now, rather than risk legislated quotas in future - when an ANC government
may be tempted to opt for the cheap solution of imposing quotas rather than
investing in black advancement through grassroots education and health
services.
'Any company that wants to survive is looking at affirmative action,' says
Ms Wendy Luhabe, whose company Bridging the Gap tries to place candidates in
companies seeking to advance blacks. 'They're frustrated because there
aren't that many qualified black people. But they're looking for ready-made
people. They have to take in graduates and begin to develop those people
instead,' she says, adding that companies must learn to focus on the
'qualities' of applicants, not formal qualifications which they lack.
The message from Ms Luhabe, and from other successful black business people,
is that affirmative action should not compromise competency. Black and white
businessmen alike agree that economic growth should not be jeopardised by
too-drastic action, and that appointments should be made on merit. They
argue that the pool of talented blacks is larger than it looks: once
selection processes are no longer biased against blacks, and prejudice no
longer impedes legitomate promotion, black advancement can proceed apace -
at no cost to standards, or to growth.
Time will tell how large is the element of wishful thinking in this scenario
(few affirmative action programmes worldwide have succeeded under conditions
of economic stagnation such as prevail in South Africa). But at least all
principal players agree on the ultimate goal: says finance minister Derek
Keys: 'We need to re-invent society in the same way as it was re-invented
with the empowerment of the Afrikaner in the 1930s' - and not by merely
exchanging white apartheid for black.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (14): Insurance chief is an unlikely
business hero - Profile, Marinus Daling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARINUS DALING, chief executive of Sankorp, the group that manages the
strategic investments of the Sanlam insurance group and driving force behind
the Gencor unbundling and Metropolitan Life black empowerment announcements
last month, is an unlikely business hero.
He has no profile outside the investment community, does not have a
compelling physical presence, and is far too well-mannered to make the grade
as a ruthless corporate buccaneer. Also, anyone in search of ground-breaking
initiatives in the South African corporate world would have been most
unlikely to commence his investigations in Bellville, home of the giant
insurer. Its image has been that of a conservative, Afrikaans organisation,
dominated by grey men in grey suits wearing grey shoes.
Some of these judgments must now be revised. Mr Daling may hail from the
small Northern Transvaal town of Nylstroom, and speak with a thick Afrikaans
accent, but there is nothing hick about his thinking on corporate structure
and investor strategy. He deserves praise, too, for encouraging decisions -
not without risk - which not only have favourable political resonances in
the new South Africa, but show that South Africa is coming more into step
with international business norms.
Though not denying the outcome, Mr Daling is emphatic that neither decision
was politically driven. 'Any businessmen who tries to take fundamental
decisions with a political agenda must have his head read.' Instead,
particularly with the Gencor deal, he has the institutional investor at the
heart of his thinking, stressing two needs: he wants to compile his own
portfolio (that is, not have managers of a conglomerate, such as Gencor, do
it for him); and he wants to invest in shares with a predictable behaviour.
'We have to make sure that we give him counters that satisfy the need. The
only thing you got out of Gencor was spread of risk' (countered by
uncertainty as to where next a conglomerate might invest - anathema to the
focused investor who wants to know where his money is going).
Mr Daling concedes that in the early 1980s he, like many other South African
executives, was overly concerned with control. The issue now, he says, is:
What can we do to add value? His answer - create vibrant businesses, exposed
to market forces, where management are given room to develop with definite
focus. He talks like one liberated of a great burden. 'If you concentrate on
control there is an end to the road. It is a finite experience. If you talk
of adding value there is no end. It is like the search for quality.'
Although Mr Daling says there was no Damascus experience, he does admit that
Derek Keys - now finance minister - who he brought in to run Gencor in 1986,
'played a major role in forming my personal ideas about how you see the
business world.'
As to the Metropolitan Life deal (Sankorp is selling 10 per cent of Metlife
for R140m to a new company that will not only be controlled by blacks, but
which will also have effective control over Metlife) Mr Daing describes it
as a 'genuine attempt to try and do something for the sake of the economy.
If we're going to have a good future we have to have all the people
participating in the economy. Our policyholders' money is in this country.
We have to make it work. We have no choice.'
He cites two reasons why people shouldn't be surprised at this initiative
coming from Sanlam - first, when formed 75 years ago, Sanlam was a vehicle
for economic empowerment of the Afrikaner. 'We (Mr Daling is Afrikaans) know
the power of the life assurance industry to empower economically.' Second,
the formation of Gencor was made possible by a similar act of corporate
statesmanship from Anglo when it gave the Afrikaans community the
opportunity to entrench its foothold in the mining sector.
Mr Daling believes South Africa will see more unbundling and black economic
empowerment initiatives 'because both are commercially sound transactions'.
Although unwilling to prescribe to other conglomerates, he makes one telling
point. 'In decision-making you must go to where the knowledge is. But
knowledge is decentralised and in some conglomerates the decision-making
power is on top, so you have a short circuit.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (13): Unbundling is dawn of a new era
 -Corporate restructuring is a hot topic in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement last month by Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining
house, that it plans to unbundle itself by distributing all its non-mining
assets to shareholders - effectively halving its size - has made corporate
restructuring the hot topic in Johannesburg.
There has been a giddy sense of the winds of change sweeping through
corporate South Africa, uprooting long-established structures and signalling
some sort of New Jerusalem on the Highveld.
Gencor's announcement has fundamentally shifted the terms of the debate. Now
one of the capitalists has broken ranks, it is no longer possible to dismiss
unbundling as an airy Marxist fancy. Indeed, it is likely that South Africa
has only witnessed the dawn of an era of significant corporate
restructuring.
That said, with the initial euphoria having receded, a more sober sense of
what unbundling might mean for the business community is emerging. Some of
the more dewy-eyed assessments that it represents a magical balm for a wide
range of political and economic ailments are quietly being discarded.
Indeed, useful debate - unbundling has been on the agenda for the past three
years - has been impeded by the shotgun usage of the term to embrace
everything from opposition to size, concern about efficiency, worries about
monopolies, desire to curb the dominant role of whites in business and the
related aim of empowering blacks economically. Opponents of unbundling have
too easily been able to avoid the real issues by citing the confusion of
some of unbundling's proponents as reason to dismiss the concept in its
entirety.
An interesting feature of the unbundling debate is that while its basic
purchase derives from the political support of the quasi-socialist ANC -
motivated by its dislike of a small white clique dominating the economy -
the intellectual legwork, in terms of why the concept deserves support, has
emerged from the investment community where it is believed unbundling will
stimulate efficiency.
Lined up against unbundling, unsurprisingly, are the leaders of South
Africa's large conglomerates - such as Anglo American, Rembrandt, Anglovaal,
Barlow Rand - who remain sceptical of the economic merits of unbundling.
They tend to argue that the issue turns on what is good for the shareholder
 -the same criterion, incidentally, Gencor used to justify its decision.
Their scepticism about unbundling is not difficult to understand. Mr Peter
Cronshaw, of Genbel, Gencor's investment arm, distinguishes 'dynastic'
conglomerates, that have been developed by families, and 'republican'
conglomerates, such as Gencor, where there is no definite line of
succession. He points out that because the former have developed from the
efforts of entrepreneurs, with these individuals/families likely still to
have a stake in the business, different dynamics are at play compared to
Gencor where no such considerations were at stake.
Ironically, since Gencor's announcement, the rise in the gold price has
again provided a reminder of the benefits of diversity. Notwithstanding deep
economic recession both in South Africa and internationally, a company such
as Anglo will benefit considerably from its large gold holdings. Thus, while
Gencor has bathed in commentators' plaudits for its bold decision, it has
been the Anglo share price which has approached record highs. In fact, the
underperformance of Gencor's share price against the All Share index since
the announcement is a reminder that the market has yet to show significant
enthusiasm for unbundling.
While the view of the market doubtless confers a nice warm feeling down at
44 Main Street, the headquarters of Anglo, there is enough strategic savvy
in Anglo to know that this is by no means the end of the argument. It is an
overwhelming probability that the next government, at the instigation of the
ANC, will take a tougher line than is at present the case on the related
issues of anti-trust policy and the structures of corporate control. Given
this, a measure of pre-emptive action - some gesture which unequivocally
carries the message 'We are on the side of change' - clearly has advantages.
As one analyst noted: 'If you're a Boer army and you see the redcoats coming
over the hill, you don't just stand there. You melt into the hillside.'
Also, there are examples in most of South Africa's large groups of
subsidiaries which appear to have withered in the shade of the parent
company. In such cases unbundling would appear to have a positive role to
play.
Although a measure of pre-emptive restructuring should not be ruled out,
politicians would have to be very naive to believe corporate South Africa
will undertake voluntary unbundling on any significant scale. More likely is
that the process will have to be encouraged by a new government. If the
process is not to degenerate into a fiasco of heavy-handed intervention,
then at least two steps will be necessary. First, a clear delineation of
priorities - for example, whether corporate restructuring is primarily about
economic justice or economic efficiency, given that the two will probably
clash in practice. Also, a distinction between the separate, if related,
issues of black empowerment, competition policy and corporate restructuring.
Second, careful empirical study, on an industry by industry basis, of why
certain structures have evolved - for example, a state sanctioned cartel
between three cement producers - and what utility they still have.
There is little doubt that South Africa stands to benefit from a freeing of
existing control structures. Equally, there is considerable potential for
harm if the corporate sector is to be bludgeoned with an ideologically
motivated restructuring policy. So far the debate has been characterised by
much rhetoric and little research. This balance needs to be reversed if
South Africa is to get the useful sort of restructuring.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (11): Gold bulls stand tall again -
The restructure taking place in the mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'GOLD IS the one object which is scarce and indestructible. It is cherished
and never cast away. It never diminishes except by outright loss. It can be
melted but it never changes its chemistry or loses its weight in the process
. . . Man does not waste gold, it is too precious."
Thus spoke Mr Anton Rupert, doyen of South African industrialists, at the
opening of the new Leeudoorn gold mine on March 1. At the time the gold
index stood at 972 and such utterances smacked of one not fully au fait with
gold's commodity status in a world of low inflation and derivative
instruments for spreading risk.
Only three months later the index has risen to around 1860 and gold bulls
again stand tall. South Africa's mining houses are understandably delighted.
Having endured a flat gold price of roughly R1,000 an ounce from 1988, the
rise of more than 20 per cent in recent months will boost industry profits
considerably - the March quarter showed operating profit geared about 4.5
times to a price move - while offering a new lease of life to marginal
producers.
Chamber of Mines estimates indicate that if the dollar gold price averages
Dollars 380 for the rest of 1993, then only about 39 tonnes of South
Africa's roughly 600 tonnes annual production will be marginal - about half
the figure for 1992.
Welcome though the recent price rise has been, it has not been the source of
unalloyed joy. Some industry figures worry that by re-establishing a
'comfort zone', the rise in the price will deflect attention from continuing
the important process of structural reform under way in the industry over
the past few years. The remarkable increase in the gold price from R25 an
ounce in 1968 to R1,000 an ounce 20 years later both allowed, and obscured,
various other trends, not all healthy: large wage increases, unrelated to
productivity; the growth of a triple bureaucracy - at mine, mining house and
industry level - and the advent of serious competition as buoyant prices
brought big international money into gold. Taken together, these
developments helped push South Africa from the cheapest producer in the
world in 1970 to its most expensive in 1990.
The full gravity of this situation only became apparent when the rand gold
price flattened out at the end of the Eighties. The industry's response,
slow initially, has been well documented. Mines shifted from a focus on
mining ore to producing gold at a profit. While the annual gold production
has remained unchanged at about 600 tonnes for the past few years, this has
been achieved with a labour force that has shrunk by 125,000, or nearly a
quarter, over the past five years.
This has been a considerable achievement, but many believe the process is
not complete. Thus Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, one of the
main producers, commented recently: 'The feeling among my general managers
is that we haven't scratched the surface yet. We haven't really taken
advantage yet of the fact that apartheid has gone. We're a very, very
inefficient industry because we haven't used our people properly.'
If the first phase of restructuring involved improving the existing system,
Mr Maude and his colleagues are now involved in questioning the very
parameters of the system - rethinking time honoured working practices. At
its most basic, this would involve flattening existing work hierarchies -
there can be eight levels between where the gold is mined and the chief
executive - and reducing horizontal rigidity; that is, trying to staff mines
with generalists, rather than continuing with the existing rigid
compartmentalisation of functions. Such innovation, however, is more likely
to succeed in a climate of adversity, where all involved see that survival
requires it. The concern is that renewed prosperity will reduce the momentum
for change, both among managers and workers.
Whatever becomes of such innovation, cost-cutting initiatives have not been
restricted to the gold industry. Indeed, across the board the response of
the mining industry to the recession in commodity prices has been
significant rationalisation. This was recently evident in the platinum
sector when industry leader Rustenburg Platinum announced it would be
closing the loss-making Boschfontein shaft. Already Impala Platinum, the
second largest producer, had cut its work force by 17 per cent, while
maintaining production, and numerous expansion plans across the industry
have been put on hold.
Well known, too, are the quota requirements and labour cuts which De Beers
has been forced to implement in response to recession in the diamond
industry, while there has also been a strong focus on cost-cutting and
rationalisation in the coal sector.
Although labour cuts in the present climate are extremely unfortunate,
belt-tightening has borne some fruits. In the words of one analyst 'it has
created innovation and good strategic thinking. This has resulted in better
management and better companies.'
Hard times also offers a partial explanation for why three important mineral
beneficiation projects - The Alusaf aluminium smelter, the Columbus
stainless steel expansion and the Namakwa heavy mineral sands project - have
received the go-ahead during the past year. The last time there was a trend
towards projects which added value to South Africa's minerals was in the
Sixties and early Seventies when the gold price was low and industry profit
margins tight. During this period operations such as Alusaf, Richards Bay
Minerals, Highveld Steel and Vanadium and ferro-alloy operations such as CMI
started up. Now, as then, the logic of adding value domestically to the
country's minerals rather than exporting them in raw form remains
impeccable.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (12): Farmers on the warpath - The
government's approach to agricultural reform has been unimaginative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH Tobie Meyer, the deputy minister of agriculture, had to suffer
the ignominy of being booed off the stage by a group of angry white farmers
in the conservative town of Potchefstroom.
The meeting had been called to protest against the government's plan to
extend employment legislation to cover farm workers. It says something for
the mood of white agriculture, however, that the meeting should have been
hijacked into the launch of a right wing political movement. The farmers'
sentiments were aptly captured by a banner which read 'Kraai het ons verraai
met sy ANC mielie prys' (literally - Kraai (Van Niekerk, the minister of
agriculture) betrayed us with his ANC maize price).
The banner is a reference to maize producers' anger at the government
setting a lower producer price than that suggested by producer
representatives. To describe a lower than desired price as an 'ANC price'
captures perfectly the fears and frustrations of farmers, many under severe
financial stress following years of drought - though the 1992/3 season
represented a return to fairly normal rainfall patterns - high interest
rates and deteriorating terms of trade.
Their bloody-mindedness has not been improved by an upsurge in politically
motivated attacks on remote farms and by provocative slogans, from the
radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in particular, about killing farmers.
The government's difficulties on the agricultural front are undoubtedly a
result of the proposed political changes. Many white farmers disagree with
the changes, and feel reform of the country's marketing structures, which
have traditionally offered protection to poorer farmers, constitutes a
further act of treachery.
In fact, the government's approach to agricultural reform has been cautious
and unimaginative. It is not that it does not know the issues. In a policy
speech in February, Mr van Niekerk acknowledged that the most difficult
issue in future would be accommodating the expectations 'of the various
individuals who are interested in agriculture but not yet part of it'. He
added that questions about land, the state of commercial farmers, starter
farmers and how the position of subsistence farmers might be improved were
important issues on which 'clear answers were necessary'.
Sadly, these clear answers are nowhere to be found. Mr Van Niekerk has
admitted that the 1984 white paper on agricultural policy is out of date,
and that a new policy is necessary to deal with issues such as possession of
land, finance, new entrants to agriculture, marketing and food security.
With the exception of marketing, however,the government has given little
indication of how it thinks these issues might be addressed. Other parties
have not done any better, with the result that there is little sense of a
national dialogue under way. This is surprising, for although agriculture
contributes only 5 per cent to GDP, it has important multiplier effects, and
is a critical source of employment and stability in rural areas.
A good place to start in the search for a new policy would be the recently
released Kassier report into the Marketing Act, the most important
contribution to agricultural debate for a number of years, and pregnant with
insight into the problems of, and possible solutions for, agriculture.
It constitutes a devastating indictment of government policy which,
Professor Kassier argues, has produced 'a largely unsustainable commercial
and poorly developed subsistence agriculture'. In other words, near total
failure - not only in homeland areas, which it neglected, but even in the
commercial sector, so long the beneficiary of government largesse.
It has also bred an agricultural bureaucracy to rank with the worst. Kassier
discerned among this group a 'disconcerting level of arrogance,
self-righteousness and self-imposed omniscience'. Individuals behave in a
'very authoritarian, domineering and dictatorial manner'.
Professor Kassier highlights the extent to which commercial agriculture is a
socialist construct when he concludes his report: 'What is needed in this
country is a system where bureaucrats and politicians no longer have the
power to make one rich or poor, but rather where this depends on the ability
to compete in the market place where one is judged by the consumer on
merit.'
Though the government professes to speak the same language, its actions tell
a different story. It will probably only reply to the Kassier report in
September, seven months after its publication, and its comments so far
suggest considerable discomfort with Professor Kassier's bracing analysis.
There can be little doubt, however, that the future will see further
liberalisation, especially on the marketing side. Farmers will be asked to
take greater responsibility for marketing their product. This process will
have to be linked to overall tariff liberalisation since tariff protection
means many farming input costs are exorbitant. On the other hand, prices are
distorted by the marketing boards. The net result, says one observer, is
that farmers are accustomed to buying retail and selling wholesale.
Normal political relations will also require a future government to look
hard at whether South Africa would not do better to import some of its food
needs from its neighbours. The government has already conceded that the
correct policy focus is not food self-sufficiency, as in the past, but food
security.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (9): Challenge of banking the
unbanked - The way forward in the new South Africa for financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
AS BEFITS a society undergoing fundamental transition, South Africa is full
of examples of poacher turned gamekeeper. A case in point concerns Moses
Mayekiso, head of the SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco), one of the
country's most prominent communist leaders. He has been a key figure in
recent years in organising civil disobedience, such as rent boycotts, in
black townships which has made the black home loan market a perilous place
for banks to be.
Mr Mayekiso is the man with whom the Association of Mortgage Lenders (AML)
has worked in an attempt to restore stability to this difficult market. Two
months ago the AML and Sanco reached an historic agreement on a set of
principles to be followed in the handling of bond payments in arrears,
payment defaults and repossessed properties. The agreement is, in effect, a
peace treaty between the two parties. What is telling, however, are the
principles underlying the treaty which make explicit the sort of issues
which need to be tackled if banking is to be successfully transacted in the
new South Africa.
Home loans, of course, are a particularly politicised area. For decades
apartheid decreed where blacks should live and denied to most the right to
home ownership. This politicised the question of where people live, and by
association, products in the housing market. The act of repossession, for
example, when a loan was in arrears, was not seen so much as the normal
functioning of the system, but as a perpetuation of the apartheid plan of
depriving blacks of housing.
Though politics has made home loans the most fraught area of lending, the
root problem, which confronts banks across the full spectrum of their
activities, is the enormous gap between the formal banking sector and the
black community. The symptoms are typically South African. On the one hand,
evidence of considerable sophistication - reputedly the highest number, per
capita, of automatic teller machines in the world. On the other, evidence of
the most basic developing country - very few black people, who constitute
about 80 per cent of the population, have cheque accounts.
How to bridge this gap - to bank the unbanked, bridge the gap between first
and third world, call it what you will - is a huge strategic challenge
facing South Africa's banks. Given that they make handsome profits serving
the first world, it might well be asked why they should bother with the
problematic third world market. There are two legs to the answer:
Profit: it constitutes a huge potential growth market; and
Self-preservation: in the words of Mr Jopie van Honschooten, head of the
Community Banking Division at Standard Bank: 'If you don't have stability in
the wider community, then you can forget about success in the formal banking
sector. It will be like having first class tickets on the Titanic.'
That is the easy part. The difficult question is that having decided it is a
market you cannot ignore, how do you approach it, and how far do you become
involved? These are still early days, but the broad outlines of the way
forward are fairly clear. First, in Mr Van Honschooten's words, 'new
mechanisms are needed for new markets'. Products developed in the developed
market cannot simply be transferred into the developing market. There is
ample evidence that this method has failed. New products and approaches are
required.
In terms of product, banks have realised that their offerings must be more
closely tailored to the actual needs of the developing community. For
example, research shows that in these communities access to credit is often
more of a problem than the cost of that credit. Also, time horizons are
often shorter. A hawker wants a loan not for three or six months, but for
three weeks. Hence, greater attention needs to be paid to 'velocity loans' -
where interest rates of 0.5-1 per centa day make sense in the short term, in
spite of appearing usurious on an annualised basis.
In terms of approach, banks have realised that they have a development role
to play. Given that most of the developing market is outside the banking
system, there is very little informal transmission of knowledge about
banking practices - for example, how to get a home loan, what commitments
are expected, what to do when in arrears, etc. If the banks want to create a
sustainable environment in which to do business, they have to take on this
educational task themselves.
As Mr Van Honschooten makes clear: 'We're not in development per se, as some
politicians would have us be. We're in development to the extent of making
banking sustainable.' He reminds that 'the role of the bank is actually as
intermediary to channel surplus savings to those who need to borrow. At our
peril in South Africa do we endanger that process.' The way to secure it, of
course, is to maintain sound principles of risk management.
What this involves is clearly spelt out in the AML/Sanco accord which, inter
alia, accepts the principles that financial institutions:
Have a contractual commitment to depositors to pay them an agreed return on
deposits;
Would be unable to raise funds for lending if they didn't offer shareholders
and providers of capital a fair return;
As custodians of the nation's savings have to act with utmost prudence in
assessing risks.
These principles are balanced by others which recognise, for example, that
'community empowerment, education and participation are vital to the process
of creating a normal property market'; repossession should be avoided
wherever possible; and the need for alternative forms of housing tenure.
In practice, what this means is that the formal banking sector is likely to
limit itself to meeting the needs of the economically active - those who
have stable employment and regular income. Those who are 'sub-optimally
economically active' - in the informal sector, with irregular income, will
have their needs met by community-based structures, supported by the formal
sector. In this regard a Community Banking Project under leadership of Mr
Bob Tucker, formerly head of The Perm building society, has done
considerable work towards establishing the commercial and practical
viability of community banking in South Africa. There seems to be a
reasonable prospect that community banking will soon be established in South
Africa to introduce, on a pilot basis, 'mass banking' into the black
community.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (10): Gold offers gleam of hope -
International economic relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S monetary guardians over the past six months have experienced
mixed blessings: significant and heartening progress in the struggle to curb
inflation being countered by the sharp decline in the country's foreign
reserves which fell by 35 per cent from a high of R11.5bn in August 1992
(2.8 months import cover) to R7.5bn (1.7 months import cover) six months
later.
The decline in reserves was caused by a sharp contraction in the current
account surplus during the second half of 1992, and an increase in capital
outflows during the fourth quarter. The deterioration in the current account
was largely the result of huge maize imports following the 1991/2 drought.
This caused the current account surplus to decline to under R1bn in the
second half of 1992 from nearly R3.5bn during the first half.
The deterioration in the capital account - capital outflows increased to
R3.7bn during the fourth quarter from less than R1bn during the third
quarter - was the result of large debt repayments, accelerated capital
flight following renewed political unrest, and adverse 'leads-and-lags' in
foreign payments as the rand weakened against the dollar. By all accounts
heavy capital outflows continued in the first four months of 1993.
The first quarter of 1993 did not bring much good cheer on the trade side
either with the trade balance falling to R2.9bn from R3.6bn in the final
quarter of 1992 and R4.5bn a year previously. Exports were only 0.4 per cent
higher than in the first quarter of 1992. Any possible dividend from the
lifting of sanctions would appear to be overshadowed by world economic
recession. Given net service payments and debt repayments that have to be
made in the balance of the year, a continuation of this trade pattern would
keep pressure on the already weak reserves position.
Coming to the rescue in recent weeks, of course, has been the sharp rise in
the price of gold. Gold still accounts for about a quarter of South Africa's
export earnings - R18.2bn out of a total R67bn in 1992. Having averaged R980
an ounce in 1992, the price has climbed in recent weeks to more than R1,200
an ounce. If it averages R1,150 an ounce for the year (Dollars 360 at R3.20
to Dollars 1 or Dollars 340 at R3.38 to Dollars 1) then, with gold
production unchanged, South Africa stands to earn an extra R3bn in foreign
exchange - a huge increase given that the current account surplus last year
stood at R4.3bn.
This will not only be welcome but necessary given that South Africa could
have to repay up to Dollars 1.6bn foreign debt this year (comprising about
Dollars 440m affected debt, tied up in the debt standstill net; Dollars 400m
converted debt - that is, previously inside the net but rolled over into
longer term loans; and about Dollars 700m unaffected debt, mostly
parastatal, that is outside the net). The parastatal debt could
theoretically be rolled over but following a brief Indian summer in 1991/2,
South Africa is again effectively cut off from world capital markets owing
to the high premiums being demanded because of political risk.
This saw the cost of borrowing rise from 1.5 percentage points over Libor in
the first half of 1992 to three percentage points over Libor in the second
half following the Boipatong massacre and the collapse of constitutional
talks. Similar premiums are being sought in the aftermath of Mr Hani's
assassination in April this year. 'We're not the flavour of the month,'
concedes a senior finance ministry official. Government and parastatals are
thus redeeming all their maturing debts rather than lending endorsement to
the high premiums demanded.
Whatever relief gold may provide, it is obviously too volatile to be relied
upon. So, while reserves remain at such low levels - the Reserve Bank's
target is that reserves should cover three months of imports - there will be
no room for easing of monetary or fiscal policy, in spite of the economy's
desperate need for some rejuvenation.
An obvious way out of this bind would be access to IMF lending facilities,
thus obviating the need to run a current account surplus to finance debt
repayments. An IMF facility, however, appears unlikely to be offered until
an interim government is in place a year or so hence. As one minister
observed, the IMF seems to believe democracy in Russia can be ensured only
by massive lending, whereas in South Africa the reverse obtains: lending can
only begin once democracy has been achieved.
Two notes of optimism arise from recent ANC statements that they will not
seek to renegotiate debt arrangements and that they will campaign for the
lifting of sanctions once an election date has been announced and a
transitional executive council is in place. This would be especially
important in the US where state and city level sanctions effectively prevent
most American and Japanese banks doing business with South Africa.
Talks held in London in April saw the South African government reach
agreement in principle with foreign creditor banks for a final debt
agreement which would see all debts in terms of the standstill repaid by
2000. The agreement will be activated once it has been endorsed by the main
political players whose consent is now being sought.
Such agreement is unlikely, in the short term, to be accompanied by removal
of the financial rand mechanism. Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve
Bank, has repeatedly made clear that the potential for disruption in the run
up to an election, and its aftermath, is too great to contemplate removal of
the financial rand which serves as a backstop to the commercial rand.
Government officials believe it will probably be removed only when foreign
investors are confident that political stability has been achieved.
A related issue is whether the country should not undertake a significant
devaluation to make its exports more competitive. While there is sympathy in
government, no initiative seems likely until there is confidence that it
will not spill over into wage and price inflation, and international
economic growth suggests such a move is likely to be beneficial.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (7): A crash course in running the
country - Andrew Gowers finds it easier to predict what an ANC government is
not likely to do to the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS

<TEXT>
SELDOM can a liberation movement have been through such a fundamental
political learning process as the African National Congress has undergone in
the three years since Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Seldom can an
opposition party have shed so much ideological baggage or been so confronted
with the limits of its power before taking office - and in no area more than
that of economic policy.
Not surprisingly in the circumstances, it is easier to predict what an
ANC-dominated government is not likely to do to the economy than what its
economic priorities will be. To judge by the policy guidelines adopted a
year ago and somewhat wishfully entitled Ready to Govern, wholesale
nationalisation of the big private-sector business groups - centrepiece of
ANC strategy in socialist exile - is out. So, in the light of the state of
the government budget, is a drastic expansion in public spending. What
remains may look perilously - or pleasantly, depending on your point of view
 -like more of the same.
A European investor with social democratic sympathies would have difficulty
taking exception to the sentiments expressed in Ready to Govern: a mixed
economy, redistribution, social partnership involving business and trade
unions, sustainable growth - the whole guided by case-by-case pragmatism
rather than doctrine. But he or she would also be hard-pressed to discern a
distilled economic programme in which choices have been made, options costed
and priorities set.
The men who run the ANC's economics department are not much more
enlightening. Mr Trevor Manuel, economic policy supremo, sketches out eight
main areas which the organisation is studying - industrial strategy, trade
and foreign investment policy, anti-trust laws, 'special treatment' for the
financial sector, land reform, the government budget, monetary affairs and
regional economic policy - but is vague on the details.
Even on the central issue of the role of the state in the economy, the ANC
has left its options wide open. Its document says that a future democratic
South Africa will consider:
Increasing the public sector in strategic areas through, for example,
nationalisation . . . ;
Reducing the public sector in certain areas in ways that will enhance
efficiency, advance affirmative action and empower the historically
disadvantaged . . .
Such hedging is not difficult to explain. For as Mr Derek Keys, the finance
minister, has relentlessly reminded the ANC and all his other audiences over
the past year, the next South African government will in large part be
confronted with the same economic constraints as bedevil the present one:
static or negative growth, sluggish investment, a bloated and inefficient
civil service, an external account squeezed by debt service payments, and
the struggle against inflation.
What is more, ANC policy-makers know full well that their only chance of
breaking out of this vicious circle lies in re-establishing economic
confidence, and for this they need to reassure both South Africa's powerful
business community and the international financial institutions, whose
approval will be vital in reintegrating the country into the world economy
after years of sanctions and isolation. If one places these prerequisites
alongside the pressures for tangible change - for example in jobs, housing
and basic social services - on which the ANC is riding to power, the scale
of the challenge becomes dauntingly obvious.
Mr Tito Mboweni, chief economist, acknowledges that the international
investment community is already uppermost in the ANC leadership's mind. Once
a multi-party transitional executive council to oversee elections is in
place, or before, the organisation will call for the lifting of
international sanctions, and for the opening of formal relations between
South Africa and the IMF and World Bank.
'We want their overall stamp of approval,' Mr Mboweni says, 'the kind of
working relationship that will send a signal to private investors that we
are pursuing policies that are not unsustainable.'
This need above all underlies the cautious noises emanating from Shell House
 -the ANC's headquarters - about fiscal policy. Mr Manuel insists that an
ANC-dominated government will not seek a dramatic expansion in the overall
budget, but will try to secure elbow-room to develop its own spending
programmes through improving efficiency and trimming in other areas. 'If we
say that there isn't much room for manoeuvre in the budget in its present
form, we're being defeatist,' he says. 'But we're not talking about throwing
money at the problem.'
Even if savings on the scale Mr Manuel envisages are obtainable, however, he
admits that the pressures for increased spending are potentially
overwhelming. 'There is a clamour,' he says. 'People want to know how the
quality of their life will improve after an election. So we have to build a
consensus in the areas where we can affect the maximum tangible change in
the shortest possible time.'
Such quick fixes will be hard to identify. So will effective measures to
deal with what the ANC believes to be the central structural problem of the
South African economy: the concentration of power in the hands of a few
large white-owned conglomerates.
'The ANC is not opposed to large firms as such,' says Ready to Govern.
'However, it will introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies
in accordance with international norms and practices, to curb monopolies,
continued domination of the economy by a minority within the white minority,
and to promote greater efficiency in the private sector.'
Mr Manuel says his organisation has been working on such a policy with
experts from the US, the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the
European Commission. But details have yet to emerge, and some leading
businessmen suspect this exercise is merely an elegant way of disguising the
retreat from nationalisation.
Indeed, perhaps the best indication of the distance ANC economic policy has
travelled in the past three years is the relatively relaxed attitude towards
a future power-sharing government on the part of the business community.
Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries, the country's largest
consumer goods producer, expresses a view widespread among English-speaking
businessmen when he says: 'We've not had good economic management in this
country for 45 years of National party rule, so I'm not frightened by the
prospect of a new government.'
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the former chairman of the Anglo-American/De Beers
group and doyen of South African business, agrees: 'Certainly, I think this
will be a government with which businesspeople can work comfortably. We've
had a good deal of experience working with very, very difficult governments
in Africa - a great deal more difficult than I think this one is likely to
be.'
A leading banker adds: 'Internationally, there is now an accepted code of
economic conduct that is conducive to growth. I have no reason to believe
that the new leadership will not adhere to that.'
In all this, there is perhaps more than a little complacency, derived from
the general expectation that the ANC will be slower in wielding real power
than in assuming office, and from the strong hope that for the first few
years at least someone like Mr Keys will retain a hand on the economic
levers.
The demands and expectations surrounding a new government, however, may mean
that such confidence turns out to be misplaced, at least in the longer term.
However sincere the ANC may be in vowing to subject itself to the
disciplines of international capital, however vehemently it preaches the
need for sustainable economic growth as well as redistribution, it will also
face enormous pressure from its constituents to deliver once in power.
The trade unions will want a say in industrial restructuring; their members
will complain about the slow pace of black economic advancement or about
uneven access to capital; the masses will cry out for government spending on
expensive programmes such as township electrification. It would not be
surprising if at some point the ANC and its only half-reconstructed allies
in the South African Communist Party felt the urge to intervene more
radically in the economy than its present reassurances suggest.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (8): Hunt for a multiracial democracy
blueprint - Patti Waldmeir at the talks with no name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAY after day, the ridiculous vies with the sublime at Johannesburg's World
Trade Centre.
At this soul-less venue, with its cavernous interior and garish carpet
tiling, 26 political groups from lunatic left to racist right search for a
blueprint to multiracial democracy.
Too often, their search is side-tracked by politics, or mere political
correctness: at one recent meeting, debate had to be suspended because two
delegations had no female representation (each is meant to be a man-woman
team). Debate could only resume once females had been found to warm the
seats beside the delegation leaders from the Transkei black homeland and
Solidarity, an Indian party.
Few of the compulsory women seated at the horseshoe-shaped table of the
52-member 'negotiating council' actually participate in debate, because none
is a political leader of substance. But woe betide the delegation which
fails to ensure that its quota of females is filled.
Delegates betray a preference for form over substance in far more serious
areas as well. When questioned sceptically about progress at the talks, one
participant replied boastfully (and without a trace of irony): 'We even got
as far as appointing a technical committee'.
Indeed, this has been the solution chosen for every thorny issue so far:
refer it to a technical committee, and claim victory. The idea seems to be
that the best way to solve political problems is to break them into
bite-sized pieces, and turn them over to legal experts for further
mastication.
This approach has undoubtedly led to progress on some issues - especially
the less controversial ones, susceptible of legalistic solutions. But where
political decisions are required, science cannot cope.
The report from the technical committee on constitutional matters, for
example, is a triumph of evasion. After a worthy but vague treatise on how
powers should be shared between national and regional governments (the crux
of the constitutional debate), it concludes: 'Powers which are not
specifically allocated in the constitution to national government or to an
SPR (state, province or regional) government, shall vest in the national
government, alternatively in the SPR government.' The committee's failure to
decide whether South Africa should be comprised of states, provinces or
regions - let alone what powers they should have - highlights the yawning
gap still to be bridged.
In the end, resolution will require a collective act of political will - not
a piecemeal effort by legal experts. Yet the negotiations seem designed to
avoid hard choices.
Everything about the talks reflects indecision: they have no name, because
participants could never decide whether to call them the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa), after last year's talks, or something new.
There is no permanent chairman, because delegates failed to choose one;
instead, they rely on six revolving chairmen.
The negotiating council's legendary capacity to avoid decisions reached the
height of farce six weeks ago, when delegates spent three hours debating
whether they had sufficient time to allow a 20-minute statement from the
Inkatha Freedom Party. In the end, they agreed Inkatha could present the
statement - to a technical committee.
But for all the council's tendency to slip into farce, the vast majority of
its time is taken up with the deadly serious business of shaping the
post-apartheid future - and of forming the personal alliances which will
determine the politics of the new South Africa.
For the deliberations of the council, which meets once or twice weekly, are
just the public face of negotiations.
The toughest bargaining takes place in the 10-man planning committee, a sort
of steering committee for the council - and at the tea table and the
delegates' canteen between sessions. That is where the peculiar chemistry of
the conference is at its most powerful: the centripetal force which has kept
conference participants at the table through the trauma of African National
Congress leader Chris Hani's assassination, and the bungled government raid
on the Pan Africanist Congress.
Indeed, many would argue that the biggest achievement of the talks is the
fact that they are taking place at all - with no deserters so far, even from
the ranks of those whose demands (for an Afrikaner homeland, or for total
black hegemony) must in the end prove incompatible with a multiracial
solution.
Vital alliances have been cemented at the World Trade Centre - between the
ANC's charismatic chief negotiator, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the disarming Roelf
Meyer, lead government negotiator; and between the two men who run the
negotiations secretariat, which effectively directs talks from the
sidelines: Mr Mac Maharaj from the ANC and Mr Fanie van der Merwe from the
government, a former terrorist and a Pretoria bureaucrat who share a rare
relationship based on mutual respect and humour.
But bonhomie at the tea table also has its dangers: it can lull delegates
into thinking that theirs is the only show in town - and that the nation
will wait on their tortuous progress. It will not.
Indeed, delegates have even shown signs of wanting to act as an ad-hoc
parliament to replace the white-dominated house in Cape Town: late last
month they summoned a government minister to explain a raid on the PAC, and
eventually forced him to back down.
It was a striking indicator of the political changes in South Africa - but
the delegates might do better to concentrate on agreeing a constitution
under which a truly representative parliament can be elected.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (6): Tough but charming architect of
change - Profile, Cyril Ramaphosa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST have been a rare moment of pleasure for Cyril Ramaphosa,
secretary-general of the African National Congress: the chance to call a
South African minister of police on the carpet before him, as though Mr
Ramaphosa were prime minister of a new South Africa.
That was the scenario two weeks ago, when Hernus Kriel, minister of law and
order, was summoned to the multi-party forum in Johannesburg to defend the
arrest of 75 leaders of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, most
of them later released without charge.
After three hours of systematic drubbing from almost every speaker in the
26-party forum, Mr Ramaphosa summed up: for the first time in history, a
minister of police had been forced to explain his conduct, not just to
whites (in the white-dominated parliament), but to the multi-racial South
African public as represented at the forum.
'You were summoned here to prove that your actions were legitimate and you
have failed to prove your case,' Mr Ramaphosa told an enraged Mr Kriel. 'I
want you to remember things are changing.'
No one can doubt that Mr Ramaphosa - the most important black leader apart
from Nelson Mandela - is one of the chief architects of change. With wit and
intelligence, he has done more than anyone else to steer delegates at the
multi-party talks towards constitutional solutions.
Tough, nay arrogant when he can afford to be - with Mr Kriel, for example,
who put up a woefully weak defence of the PAC arrests - charm is Mr
Ramaphosa's more frequent weapon. He knows that part of his job as ANC chief
negotiator is to help his opponents save face - an especially useful skill
when dealing with the proud and irascible Inkatha Freedom Party - and he is
never loath to help out, in the interests of constructive compromise.
Mr Ramaphosa spoke recently about the key compromises yet to be achieved: on
the related issues of how power will be shared within the Cabinet of a new
multi-racial coalition government, and how it will be distributed between
central and regional governments.
The ANC secretary-general rejects outright the demand made above, by
President FW de Klerk, for a system of permanently entrenched power-sharing
which would effectively give the National Party a veto over decisions in
Cabinet for the foreseeable future.
Mr Ramaphosa and the ANC are clearly willing to go a long way towards
accommodating the National Party's desire to retain substantial power in an
elected government of national unity - further, indeed, than many of their
supporters would wish - but the coalition must be voluntary, not enforced.
'Naturally an inner cabinet will evolve where deadlocks can be resolved,'
says Mr Ramaphosa, in response to Government's proposal that an 'executive
council' of the main party leaders (probably the ANC, the NP and Inkatha)
should form an inner cabinet which would be forced to take all principal
decisions by consensus.
'The key issue is to what extent you give them formal recognition,' he says,
reflecting on government's demand that this arrangement be entrenched in the
constitution. 'An inner cabinet creates a second centre of power - it goes
beyond a government of national unity, making the outer cabinet just a
rubber stamp.
'The president will consult, naturally,' he says, stressing the ANC's vision
of a voluntary coalition, evolving naturally to respond to the need for
racial reconciliation in the new South Africa. 'But he will have executive
powers.' (The ANC's position is that the president will seek consensus on
only the most crucial decisions. If this cannot be done, he will proceed
after a two-thirds Cabinet vote.)
Mr Ramaphosa predicts success in resolving this issue, as well as the
related problem of how power will be shared between regions and central
government. 'The centre must have overriding powers on certain things but in
other areas powers must be exclusive to the other levels,' he argues,
highlighting a significant ANC concession to those who favour strong
regional government (the National Party, Inkatha, and other regionally-based
parties): regions must have exclusive powers, entrenched in the
constitution.
'The key issue will be to identify those powers,' he says, mentioning 'tree
planting, dog licences, casino licences' as areas for regional control.
Mr Ramaphosa knows that Inkatha will never settle for menial powers for
regions, and he offers this list mostly in jest.
But even when serious, he is offering little more than administrative
control of areas such as health and education to the regions: the national
government must set policy in these areas, he says, adding 'central
government must have overriding powers if a region deviates from national
policy'.
Regionally-based parties, especially Inkatha, continue to demand more power,
but the ANC leader nevertheless believes agreement will be reached on this
issue soon.
Indeed, he is confident of agreement soon on all the constitutional measures
needed to ensure the first multi-racial elections can be held by next April.
But then, he has little choice but to be optimistic: no ANC leader is more
closely identified with negotiations; Mr Ramaphosa has a vital vested
interest in success.

<TEXT>
What is your concept of power-sharing?
In a government of national unity we believe that all major parties must
play a fundamental role, and I have no doubt that my party will be one of
those. But it won't be a white hand (on the tiller of state), it will be the
hand of the leader of the National Party which will be the biggest or the
second biggest party after an election. There are fundamental differences
(on power-sharing) which need to be solved . . . (but) I believe that an
agreement on how you structure a government of national unity will be
achieved.
Would this not give the National Party an effective veto over decisions made
in a power-sharing cabinet?
We are not talking about vetos. We are talking about the need in a
government of national unity - with regard to fundamental issues - for the
country to be governed on the basis of consensus between the main role
players. With regard to matters of average importance one can always have an
agreement as to how differences between them can be settled. But with regard
to the fundamentals, there needs to be consensus.
And the obvious thing would be for the main role players immediately after
an election getting together, working out a framework: What will our policy
during the five years be with regard to the economy, with regard to
education, with regard to health, with regard to everything? And that policy
framework becomes almost the Magna Carta for that five years.
So we are not talking about a veto: I am talking about the creation of a
basis which makes constructive co-operation possible. The government of
national unity cannot succeed if it has a confrontation between the main
role players every day. Consensus is arrived at through negotiation and
fundamental interaction and a meeting of the minds. A veto calls before the
eye proposals put on the table, a vote being taken, one party having the
inherent right to say: I veto, I block. It is psychologically and
philosophically quite different from consensus.
How do you define this in a constitution?
There are various ways. One can list the type of fundamental principles
which need consensus - one can form between the main role players an
executive committee and say that executive committee will agree upon the
policy principles on which the co-operation within the government of
national unity will be based, and they will take decisions by consensus and
not by a head count.
So a sort of inner cabinet . . . ?
Yes: in terms of our proposal, the members of such an executive committee
would on a rotating basis, for instance, act as chairman of the cabinet.
Would there be a president as well as a chairman of the cabinet?
Well, that's a question for negotiation. I'm easy. But having gone through
the experience of being head of state and head of government simultaneously,
it is a tremendous task and I personally think that we made a mistake by
merging the positions of president and prime minister.
How serious is the challenge posed by the Conservative Party to the
negotiations?
The CP is no longer what it used to be. It has split. I have no doubt that
the Afrikaner Volksunie (a moderate offshoot of the CP) will be on board and
even be on board with enthusiasm if a meaningful regional system is assured.
And I think that once that agreement is reached they will grow at the cost
of the CP. The CP will then be faced with a choice: do we break, or do we
adapt? And I have no doubt that there are strong elements in the CP who are
looking at adaptation. In that sense of the word I think there are elements
in the CP who might opt for a more radical route, but there are definitely
also strong elements who will opt for a moderate route.
How seriously do you view the threat of a coalition between the CP and the
Inkatha Freedom Party?
A real alliance between the IFP and the CP is out of the question because
the IFP very strongly rejects any form of racism and is philosophically
miles apart from the CP on that fundamental issue. The CP does not stand for
just devolution of power and entrenched powers of regions: the CP (is)
pleading for an ethnic white sovereign state that would become part of a
confederal southern Africa.
Would you demand that consensus decision-making be written into the
constitution forever, or for just five years?
We definitely believe that also in a second constitution or final
constitution - whatever one might call it - that the principle of
power-sharing must be part of it. But it need not be in exactly the same way
that it is achieved in a government of national unity. We are negotiating to
have such a principle included in the constitutional principles by which a
constitution-
writing body will be bound.
For the foreseeable future?
Yes. We sincerely believe that a winner-takes-all model is the worst
possible model which there can be for South Africa. But there are various
scenarios on which I don't want to speculate which contain forms of
power-sharing which are totally in step with true democracy and what
pertains in many countries in different forms throughout the world.
But proportional representation and strong regional government would not be
enough?
That is not enough. There must be the limitation of the power of any
government also when it comes to the executive, not to such an extent that
it must be a lame duck government but to ensure, as the founders of the
American constitution did, there won't be misuse of power.
What will happen if no agreement is reached at the multi-party talks?
I've said that if negotiations were to break down the government will have
to take responsible initiatives to ensure continued progress. It is
something quite different from a go-it-alone scenario. We are not
considering that. But . . . I really don't believe it will be necessary. I
think we're going to get sufficient consensus to move forward in the
knowledge that the vast majority of South Africans are supportive.
And if no elections could be held?
I'm a democrat. I think the people want to vote, especially those who've
never had the chance to vote. I'm committed to a democratic process and to
constitutional changes being brought about constitutionally.
Is your party fully behind you?
I've no doubt that I have my party behind me. But what is true is that at
grass roots level, because of the continuing violence, because of from time
to time irresponsible, almost shocking statements being made - like the one
of reducing the voting age to 14 - confidence is undermined in the
commitment of other role players. If we make a good agreement, this
uncertainty will be removed and be replaced by confidence. A bad agreement
will result in radicals both to the left and the right growing in strength
and the broad moderate centre losing support. I do not intend to sign a bad
agreement.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (4): In search of skills and
technology - Resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a decade of political turmoil, sanctions and disinvestment, few
multinationals have been perched on the end of their chairs waiting for
Nelson Mandela to give the green light to invest in South Africa. But with
investment at its lowest level for more than 30 years (15.9 per cent of
GDP), and with capital pouring out of the country at the rate of 2.8 per
cent of GDP between 1985 and 1992 the resumption of foreign investment is
crucial to sustained recovery.
Little is likely to materialise in the near term, though in both business
and government there are high hopes of resumed access to IMF and the World
Bank funding once agreement is reached at the constitutional negotiations.
Welcome though this will be, what South Africa desperately needs is
substantial direct investment inflows, bringing with them skills, technology
and market access.
The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC)
estimates that between 1984 and 1991, 214 US firms or about two thirds of
those with investments in South Africa disinvested. As a result, the stock
of US direct investment fell to Dollars 700m at the end of the 1980s from
Dollars 2.6bn at the start. Another 190 non-US firms have left during the
same period, the majority British-owned. Many foreign firms retained
non-equity links with South Africa, which could limit the number of
returnees.
There have been some moves since the sanctions thaw began three years ago
with Mr Mandela's release. The IRRC says 16 US companies have quietly opened
offices or established subsidiaries in the past two years, including four of
the 168 US corporations that disinvested between 1985 and 1990. Six of the
new entrants were in the software and computer businesses.
There are now 119 US corporations with direct investments or employees in
South Africa, with many more likely to set up shop once second-tier
sanctions, operated by more than 60 city, county and state organisations
penalising US firms doing business in South Africa, are lifted.
Britain is by far the biggest player with the UK-South Africa Trade
Association estimating British investment, direct and portfolio, at more
than Dollars 16bn. The London School of Economics Centre for the Study of
the South African Economy and International Finance, has identified 51 new
investments in the country since late 1989. While stressing that its
database is incomplete the centre estimates the inflow of new direct
investment over the past three years at around Dollars 1.5bn or 1.5 per cent
of GNP.
The LSE Centre found that the bulk of the resumed foreign investment has
focused on a narrow range of activities - those that are highly vertically
integrated, knowledge and communications intensive and quality dependent.
More than 85 per cent of the investments identified since 1989 were in five
sectors - beverages, hotels and leisure, electronics, chemicals and oils and
engineering. According to the IRRC, a feature of renewed US investment is
the switch from equity to non-equity links, with the number of US companies
with non-equity links increasing from 184 to 299. South African Reserve Bank
figures show a similar trend. The Bank's census of foreign transactions for
1989, just released, makes a distinction between direct and non-direct
investments, noting that the share of the latter has risen from 46 per cent
of the total in 1973 to more than 76 per cent in 1989.
Since South Africa fell off the foreign investment agenda of most global
firms in the mid-1980s, the rules of the game have changed. Today's global
business is unenthusiastic about natural resource investments in mining and
less likely than 20 years ago to be attracted by plentiful labour, even when
it is low-cost. The key attractions today are markets and skills and because
South Africa is a long way from the Triad markets of North America, the EC
and the Far East and has little to offer on the skills front, new foreign
investors - as distinct from those already there - may well be thin on the
ground.
The more so if the new government insists on codes of conduct, social
programmes, affirmative action, and expatriate and local value-added quotas.
The fact is that global competition for inward investment is intense and
there are already enough disincentives to investment in South Africa without
throwing up new obstacles that do not apply elsewhere in the third world.
Pessimism can be overdone. A peaceful, stable South Africa must become the
logical headquarters for African operations and the platform for developing
exports and markets in the sub-Saharan region.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (2): Structural defects in an ailing
economy - Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty and
violence have taken their toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICANS have to believe that post-apartheid economic performance will
break the post-independence African mould. For many such a belief has to be
a triumph of faith over experience and possibly even logic, especially since
for the past 20 years, the South African economy itself has performed no
better than many in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of this year, per capita
incomes, at 1985 prices, will have slipped below R3,100 to their lowest
point since 1970.
The South Africa economy is certainly not 'in ruins' as suggested in 1991 by
Nelson Mandela, but then neither is it in anything remotely resembling peak
condition. Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty,
violence and mass action have taken their toll on the economy and continue
to do so. The skills haemorrhage is resuming on a debilitating scale to be
followed, no doubt, by an exodus of experience from the public sector as
affirmative action takes off.
Structural defects are highlighted in the recently-published Normative
Economic Model (NEM) - the work of Pretoria officialdom. A decade of
stagnation is blamed on double-digit inflation since the early 1970s,
declining investment volumes and efficiency, increased government
consumption spending - up to 18 per cent of GDP during the 1985-91 period
from 12 per cent in the 1960s - and the juxtaposition of rising real wages
and falling formal sector employment.
Growth potential has slowed dramatically from an average of 5.5 per cent
between 1961 and 1978 to 1.3 per cent in recent years. In narrow
macroeconomic terms, this is the result of a decline in net investment to
less than 4 per cent of GDP since 1985, falling below 1 per cent last year,
while the capital output ratio has widened from 2.1 in the 1960s to 3.0,
meaning that more investment rands are needed to increase output.
A crucial structural defect, too, is the high level of capital intensity.
According to the NEM, a prime goal of a labour-surplus country should be the
promotion of labour-intensive techniques, but South Africa has been heading
in the opposite direction.
Since 1961, the capital-to-labour ratio has virtually doubled with the
result that even were the economy to grow at 4.5 per cent annually for the
rest of the decade, unemployment would continue to rise.
Not everyone agrees with this analysis. Not only does it assume that future
relationships between investment and employment will replicate the past - a
generic weakness of such models - but it is guilty of what Mr Edward Osborn,
chief economist of Nedbank, calls 'a fallacy of aggregation'.
The NEM has several explanations for the rise in capital-intensity,
including large capital-intensive projects carried out by the state which
has left the country with surplus capacity in energy and transport, negative
real interest rates which encouraged capital-intensive investments, existing
consumption patterns and, of course, relatively high labour costs. Nedbank
is more circumspect, pointing out that the growth in capital intensity in
manufacturing is traceable to heavy investment in the steel, synthetic fuels
and pulp and paper sectors.
Whoever is right, the prospects for a reversal of this trend - fundamental
to the NEM's aim of employment-generating economic growth - are belied by
recent significant investment decisions. The principal commodity-based
investment projects now being developed - the Alusaf aluminium smelter, the
Oryx and Moab gold mines, the Namakwa Sands mining project, and the Columbus
stainless steel complex - are all capital-intensive.
This is not to criticise the model's appropriate focus on employment
creation. As a supplyside model, the NEM concentrates on fostering a policy
environment conducive to export-led, labour-intensive industrial growth. It
says little about the demand side of the equation which, if the Alusaf and
Columbus projects are any guide, points in the direction of continuing
capital intensity.
Similarly, the country's existing export portfolio reflects an essentially
resource-based pattern of industrialisation with direct mining and
agricultural exports accounting for more than 70 per cent of the total, and
processed primary products for a further 5 per cent. The balance is
dominated by iron and steel products (10 per cent) and chemicals (3.5 per
cent).
This leaves a little over 10 per cent for manufactured exports - dominated
by textiles, machinery and equipment. Even that could well be an
overstatement when account is taken of re-exports to the sub-continent.
Private sector economists argue that in terms of productivity, labour costs
and the cost of capital, South Africa is simply not a world class player in
manufacturing.
Officials say this is changing, predicting 5 per cent inflation in 1995/6
compared with a forecast 11 per cent this year, and arguing that the NEM's
prescriptions of increased market competition and the phasing down of tariff
protection and exchange controls will boost international competitiveness.
In part, this optimism is based on the moderation in wage demands and awards
that has followed four years of recession, and on the restructuring that has
already taken place in gold mining where more than 120,000 jobs have been
shed and in the state-owned railway system, Transnet, which has halved its
workforce to 135,000 from 289,000 in 1982.
If narrow economic considerations were all that mattered, such optimism
might well be justified. But engineering a sustainable fall in inflation and
a significant shift of resources from consumption to investment at a time of
wrenching political change, when the majority of the population is expecting
a 'liberation dividend' and when the underlying fiscal situation is far from
healthy, will be exceptionally difficult. The signs are that the governor of
the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, the architect of monetary
restraint, will be reappointed, thereby ensuring that monetary discipline is
retained.
But the planned halving by 1997 of the public sector deficit, from a
forecast 6.8 per cent of GDP this year will be extremely difficult to
achieve. Even before the transfer of power to a more 'people-oriented'
administration, the Reserve Bank says the level of government spending is
'exceptionally high', reaching 31.4 per cent of GDP last year.
There will be savings as the apartheid-driven duplication of public services
is eradicated, but a significant peace dividend is unlikely given the
proposed integration of the ANC's military wing into the armed forces.
Spending on job creation, social upliftment and poverty reduction will put
an enormous burden on the public purse along with the expansion of public
sector employment, the cost of reintegrating the 6.5mpeople from the TBVC
(homeland) states, and terminal benefits for many whites in the public
sector and the security forces who will want to embark on fresh careers
within and outside South Africa.
Although South Africa is substantially underborrowed externally,
domestically it is teetering on the brink of a debt trap. Interest payments
which accounted for a mere 3.9 per cent of the national budget in 1976 will
absorb 17.4 per cent this year. Unless government spending  - and the
deficit - are tackled decisively, the public debt, currently 53 per cent of
GDP, will escalate pushing the country ever deeper into a debt trap where
increased borrowing will be needed to finance interest payments.
African experience in structural adjustment is less than reassuring.
Governments have been unwilling, or unable, to impose fiscal discipline. Why
should South Africa be any different ?
Possibly because it has excess infrastructural capacity, the strongest
private sector and financial infrastructure in the continent, a strong
skills base - by African standards - and the advantage of having travelled
some distance down the learning curve before having to make hard economic
choices. The ANC has moved a long way towards the centre largely dropping
nationalisation from its policy agenda, softening its antipathy towards
foreign investment and backing away from many of its interventionist ideas.
There is a high degree of convergence in economic thinking with economists
from the ANC and the labour unions reluctantly accepting that they will not
be able to create a brave new world in a matter of a few years, and that
wage restraint and fiscal and monetary discipline must remain at the head of
the policy agenda for the foreseeable future. One businessman, who works
alongside the ANC/Cosatu alliance in the tripartite National Economic Forum,
representing business, government and the unions, is confident that the ANC
will be 'ruthlessly pragmatic' in economic policy-making.
This may well be the present game plan, but it assumes not only that the ANC
will abandon much of the ideological baggage accumulated during its years in
the political wilderness, but also that its constituencies  - the unions,
the students, the peasants and the unemployed - will be willing to forgo
butter tomorrow in anticipation of butter and jam in five years' time.
The optimists argue that it need not come to this; that the recent surge in
the gold price and the forecast world economic recovery will provide a
window of opportunity taking the pressure off the balance of payments, the
budget deficit and monetary policy. The upbeat scenario has a final
agreement on the debt standstill in place before the end of this year,
resumed access to IMF and World Bank funding during 1994, the
rationalisation of tariffs and partial liberalisation of exchange controls,
including abolition of the financial rand, and a significant rand
devaluation to boost industrial exports.
On this scenario, the four-year-long recession bottoms out in the latter
half of 1993, and the economy rebounds on to a 4 per cent growth path from
next year. Once devaluation is digested, inflation stabilises at 8 per cent
to 10 per cent, and foreign investment resumes in the mid-90s when the
international business community is satisfied that the mould really has been
broken.
For this upbeat scenario to materialise, a formidable array of conditions
must be satisfied, most crucially the next government being sufficiently
strong-willed to tread the finest of lines between satisfying its disparate
constituencies and rebuilding business and investor confidence at home and
abroad.
A tall order for any administration, and especially one with a built-in
mistrust of big business and a naive confidence in the ability of
macro-economic policies to restructure an essentially third-world,
commodity-dependent economy.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (1): Yearning for stability - After
nearly four years of upheaval, South Africa desperately needs a political
settlement. Both Nelson Mandela and President FW de Klerk are determined to
deliver a negotiated government of national unity. But time is running out

THE centre holds. It held when South Africa faced the biggest political
crisis of the post-apartheid era, the assassination of African National
Congress leader Chris Hani. It held when the butchers of Boipatong and Bisho
cut down innocent blacks. It held when black hands murdered white farmers.
Over the past year, the centre has held against all the odds, against every
threat from right or left. And it holds still.
For a country divided by history and design, with one of the world's highest
rates of crime, political violence, unemployment and poverty, that is
something of a miracle.
Over the next year, there is every chance that the centre will grow stronger
still - if only because the spectre of racist radicals to left and right
will frighten the ANC and the ruling National Party into an ever-tighter
embrace. Weakness has always been the cement which bound their reluctant
alliance - each knew it could not survive without the other - and that bond
can only grow as inevitable defections to hard-line black and white parties
(such as the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress and the Afrikaner
nationalist Conservative Party) render each weaker still.
But within that centre ground, the most momentous shifts are taking place:
for sometime over the Easter weekend - the fateful weekend of the Hani
assassination - the National Party passed an historic point of no return.
The balance of power - still nominally Pretoria's, with its control of the
security forces, the administration and the fiscal purse-strings - began to
tilt in favour of those who must eventually take over as the dominant force,
the ANC.
President FW de Klerk, with all his police and soldiers, had no choice but
to hand over responsibility for law and order to ANC president Nelson
Mandela. Mr Mandela - not Mr de Klerk - issued a televised appeal for calm,
in tacit admission that only he could prevent the threatened descent into
chaos. Mr de Klerk controlled the state; but Mr Mandela controlled the
nation.
Since then, President de Klerk has done all he can to restore the
credibility lost during that period, when National Party supporters finally
faced the inevitable: the loss of monopoly white power, and the spectre of
black rule. He has ostentatiously wielded the levers of power - rejecting,
to ANC howls of outrage, an independently-chosen board of governors for the
state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation - and insisting (as he
does elsewhere in this survey) that the hand of a National Party leader will
remain on the tiller for the foreseeable future.
But many of his supporters - and a substantial section of his caucus - seem
to have lost faith in these assurances. White morale has never been so low,
generating a boom for international removals companies. According to the
most recent opinion poll, National Party support among whites has fallen
below 25 per cent for the first time.
This may not be good news for South African democracy. For Mr de Klerk's
mission has ever been to ensure that moderate forces - led by him, and
including the Afrikaner nation which he alone can protect - can prevent a
black government from ruling unchecked. If he thinks this goal is
threatened, he is likely to harden his bottom line.
He has made clear his demands: the National Party will require what amounts
to a veto over cabinet decisions on fundamental issues - until at least the
end of the century, perhaps beyond.
ANC leaders reject this, though they have conceded the first post-election
cabinet will include all leaders with more than 5 per cent of the popular
vote (with cabinet posts distributed proportionately) and that Mr de Klerk
will have what amounts to a veto over a very limited number of issues. They
have also conceded that significant powers be devolved from central to
regional governments - another check on ANC domination, demanded by Mr de
Klerk - but the detailed distribution has yet to be agreed. In narrowing the
gaps on these issues, Messrs de Klerk and Mandela will finally answer the
question they have so long avoided: who will wield real power in the new
South Africa?
The answer seems obvious: the ANC and the National Party together - but not
necessarily under conditions of true democracy. First prize remains a
government of national unity ruling under a negotiated multiracial
constitution, with maximum popular legitimacy. But stability - however it is
achieved - is a close second, and gaining.
After nearly four years of political upheaval, South Africa yearns for
stability: without it, the economy cannot recover from its four-year
recession; schools will remain in chaos; the water will not run and the
toilets will not work in the townships; crime cannot be contained. And South
Africa risks losing the skilled people who alone can prevent it, in the
words of one leading Afrikaner, from 'sliding into Africa'.
Both the ANC and the National Party are determined to deliver stability. For
the moment, they are still striving for first prize, a negotiated government
of national unity, ruling under a more or less liberal constitution. They
may well get the first instalment of that prize soon: a 26-party
transitional executive council with narrow authority to oversee government
in the run-up to elections tentatively set for April 27 next year.
But it falls far short of the constitutional deal which must be agreed by
September if elections are to be held in April. The game plan is for the ANC
and government to force through the 26-party constitutional negotiating
forum their own outline agreement on a new constitution, which calls for a
five-year multiracial power-sharing cabinet, proportional representation, a
bill of rights, and substantial devolution of power to regions.
Their dual challenge is to finalise their own agreement on power-sharing
(which could prove more difficult than anticipated, if Mr de Klerk is
serious about a permanent arrangement) while trying to drag other parties
into the deal. Their goal is to ensure that those who could do most to
sabotage elections and destabilise a new government - the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom Party, the black-radical Pan Africanist Congress, the
right-wing Conservative Party and the moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie -
will give a new constitution their blessing.
They may soon conclude that is an impossible task. So far, they have kept
all parties at the table primarily by skirting important issues; but time
has run out on such leisurely tactics. Before September, they must agree an
interim constitution under which to hold elections; settle a host of
problems such as the powers of the transitional executive, and of
independent commissions to oversee elections and the state broadcast media;
resolve the issue of joint control of the security forces and political
armies; and agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution
will be bound. This list goes on and on.
Negotiators from both sides make clear that a deal will be pushed through,
no matter who disagrees (Inkatha's broadly constructive attitude at the
talks suggests Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has accepted that reality).
Legitimacy will be guaranteed either by free and fair elections (a long
shot, given the present violence), by a popular referendum - or not at all.
Dissent will be dealt with either within the constitution, or outside it,
but it will be dealt with.
It would be a shame if South Africa ends up with no more than - in the words
of ANC constitutional expert Albie Sachs - 'deracialised oppression'. But if
the choice is between peace, stability and economic growth on the one side -
and democracy on the other - South Africa may yet decide democracy is a
luxury it cannot afford.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Nato offers warplanes to defend UN troops in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO is to offer warplanes to defend United Nations troops in Bosnia,
although the allies appeared yesterday to disagree over the circumstances in
which they would be deployed.
Croatian gunmen, meanwhile, held up a relief convoy taking supplies to
Moslems in Bosnia and shot dead at least eight civilian drivers. The gunmen
then looted the lorries before UN peacekeeping troops could intervene.
The Nato offer of warplanes came in response to a suggestion by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that Nato should be given the task
of providing such protective air power on the UN's behalf. It was made
public at the beginning of a two-day Nato foreign ministers' meeting in
Athens.
It was also announced that a Nato summit, proposed by US president Bill
Clinton, would be held in December to give member countries an opportunity
to adapt the alliance's agenda to the post-cold war world.
Significantly, the communique issued after yesterday's Nato meeting does not
restrict air protection in Bosnia to the six Moslem enclaves within the
republic. 'We offer our protective air power in case of attack against
Unprofor (UN Protection Forces) in the performance of its overall mandate,'
the document stated.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated that this meant air
power could be used to protect UN forces anywhere in Bosnia, if called on to
do so. What it did not mean was that air strikes would be used to protect
the civilian population from attack.
This interpretation was supported by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, though Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was of the view
that air power would be used only to protect Unprofor troops in the
officially designated safe areas.
The need to work out a common position on former Yugoslavia, together with
the closely related issue of co-operation on world peacekeeping operations,
is likely to figure prominently at the Nato summit, to be held at a venue in
Europe to be decided.
Mr Christopher also announced that the US had offered to contribute 300
troops to the UN peacekeeping contingent in the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia. This now numbers about 700 and is intended to prevent the
Yugoslav conflict spilling over into Macedonia.
'This offer of US troops to the UN has both symbolic and tangible
significance. These troops underscore the seriousness of our warning to
Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs,' Mr Christopher told the Nato council.
He stressed at a news conference, however, that Washington would not provide
ground troops for the protection of Moslem 'safe areas' in Bosnia.
The relief convoy attacked in Bosnia was heading for the mainly Moslem town
of Tuzla, when it was halted near the disputed town of Novi Travnik. UN
officials said Croat gunmen ransacked some of the 170 lorries.
'I saw drivers being dragged from their vehicles,' said a British corporal
attached to the UN peacekeeping troops trying to protect the convoy. 'I then
heard a series of shots and a little later I saw a number of bodies being
dragged away.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp decline in preliminary profits, a swingeing cut in the dividend
total and another reminder of the impact of the recession in Germany
triggered a steep slide in Pilkington shares.
The rest of the building materials area also dipped as worries about Germany
continued to ripple across the stock market. The Pilkington news came hard
on the heels of the warning made by Meyer International on Tuesday about the
depth of the recession in Germany and across the rest of continental Europe.
Pilkington shares dropped to a day's low point of 125p before steadying and
ending a difficult session a net 6 lower at 130p. Turnover of 10m Pilkington
shares was the highest in a single trading session since April 1, when the
company issued Pounds 80m worth of convertible bonds.
Worries about the trading outlook in Germany overshadowed Redland and RMC,
among Europe's biggest building materials providers and both heavily
involved in that country. The latter, a new entrant in the FT-SE 100 Index
as from June 21, lost 6 to 769p and the former eased 3 more to 475p.
George Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue, at a deeply discounted 148p a
share, drew an initially enthusiastic reception from the market, where
Wimpey stock pushed up to 193p. A more detailed appraisal of the issue and
of the reasons behind it took the gloss off the shares, however, which
retreated in orderly fashion to close a net 3 easier at 184p. Turnover in
Wimpey was a hefty 7.6m shares, easily the highest since the Grove Charity
sold a 29 per cent stake in Wimpey at 131p a share in March.
'The issue smacks of opportunism, but could well have been shrewdly timed,'
said one analyst of the building sector.
Other housebuilders moved up as the market searched for companies likely to
grasp the opportunity to raise capital at a time when the opportunities in
the sector are emerging. Costain attracted keen support, with the stock
running up 5 to 45 1/2 p on much heavier than usual turnover of 3.5m shares.
There were numerous big trades in the oil sector, notably a line of 4m Shell
Transport traded at 614p, well below the ruling market price. Shell closed
the day a net 5 down at 622p.
British Petroleum, on the other hand, rose 4 1/2 to 314 1/2 p following
renewed and aggressive buying said to have been carried out by Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank.
A block of 2m Monument Oil &amp; Gas shares was sold into the market at 46p.
In a series of big individual trades late in the session, a block of 5.8m BT
was dealt in at 406p, 5.9m Hanson at 225p, 1.4m Lloyds at 560p and 6.5m
Marks and Spencer at 343p.
Family reasons and accountants' advice were cited as being behind a large
placement of shares in Betterware, the door-to-door sales operation, by its
chief executive and a non-executive director. The placement represented 13.1
per cent of the company.
Mr Andrew Cohen and Mr Stanley Cohen placed a total of 13.4m Betterware
shares with institutions and other investors at a price of 230p through BZW
and Albert E. Sharpe. The shares gave up 8 to finish at 240p in a volume of
18m.
Great Universal Stores 'A' bucked the generally downward trend of the market
yesterday, rising 20 to 1670p. One persistant buyer was said to be behind
the move, which was in thin volume, while analysts pointed to GUS's property
benefits. With its results due next month, investors are thought to be
optimistic.
Quayle Munro, the Scottish merchant bank, made a successful debut. Placed at
118p by broker Williams de Broe, the shares moved up from an opening level
of 123p to end at 130p.
Shares in Ladbroke, the entertainments group, firmed 2 to 192p after NatWest
securities added the stock to its ''Best ideas outperform list'. The
addition of Ladbroke to the NatWest list was at the expense of Hickson
International, whose shares gave up 15 to 217p on the news.
Property shares declined moderately in line with the slipping tide of the
market. After this week's well received cash call, Great Portland Estates
has watched its popularity fade. The stock lost 4 to 196p as BZW issued a
sell note calling the company 'unexciting at best'.
Compass moved 13 ahead to 504p following the successful placing of the rump
of the rights issue. The recent profits downgrades in MB-Caradon continued
to dampen investment enthusiasm for the stock, which lost a further 8 to
269p.

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent weakness in Glaxo shares was checked after the company gave a
briefing to a group of UK pharmaceuticals analysts. The stock has fallen
from its mid-May level of 655p to the low 580s, amid worries about profit
margins in the US. At yesterday's close, Glaxo shares were 14 higher at 596p
following well above average turnover of 6.3m. Kleinwort Benson was believed
to have been an aggressive buyer.
Glaxo was said to be taking a bullish view of sales of its anti-migraine
drug Imigran and to have substantial cost-cutting measures in the pipeline;
it was also understood to be confident of defending the patent on its Zantac
anti-ulcer drug.
Wellcome shares, however, remained firmly depressed, relinguishing an early
rise which took the stock up to 730p and settling a net 6 down at 720p with
turnover a hefty 5.5m.

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness tremors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortunes of Guinness shares see-sawed yesterday after LMVH, the French
luxury products maker which has a 24 per cent cross-holding in the company,
warned of lower first half profits. Guinness ended the day where it had
begun - at 478p - although it lost 5 in early trading when one broker was
said to have turned negative.
Analysts decided not to alter forecasts for Guinness profits in spite of
developments at LMVH and the stock rallied in a volume of 2m. One said that
although the cross-share relationship would impact on Guinness, it would not
be of crucial importance.
One analyst said fears over the effect of falling champagne prices had
caused concern about LMVH's contribution to Guinness but added that this
alarm was largely misplaced. He believed the Guinness share price would
drift between 450p and 500p.

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce ceiling challenged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AERO-ENGINE manufacturer Rolls-Royce attracted attention in an otherwise
dull session, after stating that the level of foreign ownership of its
shares had reached 29.5 per cent, the maximum permitted by the company's
articles of association. The limit was raised to its present level in 1989.
Buying from overseas investors has underpinned the share price in recent
months, but henceforth any purchases from non-UK investors will have to be
relinquished and transferred to UK ownership, as and when the company issues
a notice.
Market watchers suggested that with the stock still attractive to overseas
buyers the present limit may soon be challenged by European Community
investors as doubts remain about the definition of foreign ownership. There
were suggestions that both Rolls-Royce and BAe, which has a similar ceiling,
have been in discussions with the UK government about raising that limit to
more than 40 per cent.
The company said it would take no immediate action in the hope that its
announcement would put a cap on any further foreign buying. It hoped the
level of foreign ownership would soon fall to below the limit without it
having to force overseas investors to sell.
In yesterday's trading, Rolls-Royce added 2 at 152p in trade of 2.9m, with
sentiment boosted by news at the Paris Air Show that it had won a Pounds 50m
engine order to power 24 BAe Hawk aircraft.

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares falter as buyers fail to
appear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUND MANAGERS continued to churn stock holdings in UK equities yesterday as
neither the departure speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor
of the exchequer, nor warnings against interest rate optimism from the
chieftains of the Bank of England, shifted views on the investment outlook.
Share prices gave back part of the gains of the previous session but closed
well above the day's lows.
The stock market appeared unsure of the implications of the formal
resignation speech by Mr Lamont, although it agreed that it reinforced the
note of political uncertainty which has contributed to the lack of direction
in the UK stock market over the past two months.
The ex-chancellor's call for an independent Bank of England was seen as
fairly routine, and equity strategists were more keenly alerted by warnings
against interest rate cuts by both the incumbent and designate governors of
the Bank. Some suggested that such apparently concerted comments from the
City indicated resistance to political pressures to reduce domestic interest
rates.
The market was also unsettled by disappointing corporate trading results,
especially from Pilkington, the glass manufacturer regarded as a classic
recovery stock; the board's comments on progress of the German economy were
badly received in London.
For much of the session, the equity market was driven, once again, by stock
index futures, which dipped to a discount against the underlying equity
market at one stage. An early gain of 4 points on the Footsie was recorded
immediately after the opening of the index futures market, and share prices
soon turned off. At worst the market was down by 12.7 but steadied as Wall
Street made a calm opening, showing a loss of 3 Dow points in UK trading
hours.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a net fall of 6.9 at 2,860. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has been strongly outperforming the Footsie,
slipped 5.7 to 3,207.7. Seaq volume fell to 620.2m shares, with non-Footsie
business good at around 60 per cent of the total. Wednesday's Seaq turnover
of 691.2m shares brought retail business worth Pounds 1.46bn.
Among the blue chip internationals, pharmaceutical stocks remained virtually
friendless, although Zeneca again stood relatively firm against a generally
dull background. The strong feature was Glaxo, after favourable comments on
its drug portfolio.
Oil issues, too, remained steady, although there was no follow-through to
the buying from the US and from continental Europe which drove Shell ahead
on the previous day.
On the domestic side, consumer stocks displayed little support for the
continued hopes that domestic base rates may soon be cut. The optimists
continued to claim that UK rates are likely to be reduced for political
reasons, no matter what trends develop on the international front. Such
hopes are focused on next week's important speech in the City by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer.
The less convinced optimists continued to point out that Wednesday's gain
has left the UK market still corseted within a trading range of around
Footsie 2,770 to 2,890.

FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE selling in stock index futures as dealers reflected on political
developments in the UK sent the June FT-SE 100 contract into retreat, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The June contract had a quiet start at 2,873, but a sell order within the
first hour of business which was said to have come from UBS sent it falling
to 2,868. Having been a strong performer for most of this week, June was now
trading at a discount to cash and that fall also pulled the underlying cash
market lower.
Sellers continued to emerge for most of the morning, with some of the large
US securities houses reported to have been among them, and the day's low of
2,852 was reached shortly after 11am. When the selling began to dry up, the
June contract recovered to trade at parity at midsession. It was a firm
gilts sector that traders looked to in the afternoon and that sentiment
helped the contract claw back some of the earlier decline.
June finished at 2,858, a 3-point discount to the underlying cash market,
with turnover coming to 7,868 lots.
In traded options, volume was down from Wednesday's hefty total. It reached
25,098 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 5,862 of that
total and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 640 lots.
Blue Circle was the busiest stock option, with a day's total of 2,648
contracts. It was followed by BTR at 1,431 lots.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities subdued by
inflation worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were flat-to-lower yesterday as dealers and investors
nervously awaited today's important inflation data, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 20.21 down at 3,491.72, but the
entire loss was due to a big decline in one stock - Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing (3M). The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.40 off at 445.38
and the Nasdaq composite eased 1.19 to 688.05. New York SE volume came to
232.6m shares.
For the fourth consecutive day, activity on the equity markets was dominated
by apprehension ahead of the publication - due this morning - of the
producer prices index for May. Ever since the surprisingly strong April
inflation figures, investors in both stock and bond markets have been
worried that a revival in inflation might prompt an interest rate rise from
the Federal Reserve.
Last Friday's unexpectedly big rise in payrolls, and the fall in the
national unemployment rate, only heightened the markets' fears that rates
may be increased to halt the progress of inflation. In particular, investors
are concerned that they may soon be facing the worst of all worlds: rising
inflation but a still sluggish economy. These fears, combined with concern
that stocks may now be dangerously overpriced, suggest that conditions are
ripe for a possible major correction in equity values.
Among individual issues, 3M plunged Dollars 10 to Dollars 105 3/4 in busy
trading after the company stated that it was lowering its own forecasts for
second-quarter earnings.
Computer stocks continued to suffer from brokers' downgrades and worries
about the outlook for the industry. Hewlett-Packard shed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 84 3/4 , IBM Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 52 1/32 , Compaq Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 52 5/8 and Unisys Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 3/8 .
Also weaker in the technology sector was Advanced Micro Devices, which
slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 1/8 in active trading after the latest
Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio came in below
forecasts. The news also hurt Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market, which fell
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 3/4 in turnover of 4.7m shares.
Xerox was one of the most heavily traded stocks of the day, holding steady
at Dollars 74 1/4 in volume of 2.8m shares. On Wednesday the company sold 7m
additional shares at Dollars 74 1/4 .
Athlone Industries forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/8 on news that
Allegheny Ludlum is to acquire the company under a merger agreement.
On the Nasdaq market, technology stocks started weaker, with Microsoft and
Apple both incurring sizeable losses, but a subsequent recovery left them up
a net Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 91 1/8 and Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 44 1/2
respectively.
Canada
THE TORONTO market closed mixed in fairly heavy trading as a late-session
rally pushed the TSE 300 index up to a net gain of 15.7 at 3,875.4. However,
falls led rises by 352 to 319 after volume of 60.4m shares.
The transportation group rose 2.1 per cent, forest products gained 1.3 per
cent and mining put on 1.2 per cent, but the golds sector was 0.5 per cent
lower.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Trading begins in new fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A NEW emerging markets fund began trading on the London stock exchange
yesterday, writes John Pitt.
The Baring Securities Emerging Markets index tracker fund, with an initial
capitalisation of Dollars 50m, follows the launch of the broker's index last
October.
The closed-end fund will track the index through investment in a diversified
portfolio of equity securities of 214 listed companies, spread between 12
countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe.
The index weights emerging markets according to the proportion of
capitalisation available to non-domestic investors, and provides a benchmark
of markets with regard to shares in which investors can realistically trade.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ferruzzi group extends losses
in Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL companies got a lot of attention, writes Our Markets Staff.
Frankfurt, Vienna, Lisbon and Warsaw were closed for public holidays.
MILAN witnessed further turbulence in Ferruzzi group shares although the
overall mood was positive with some strong gains in a number of major
issues.
As a result the Comit index nudged 7.34 higher at 533.24.
Nevertheless, it was the collapse of the Ferruzzi share price which
attracted most attention. The shares lost another L24 to L805, but ended off
the day's low of L795. During the session Mr Carlo Sama, the managing
director, said that the group would not be asking for a suspension in
trading. Since the restructuring plan was announced last weekend the shares
have fallen by 12 per cent.
Some brokers commented that there was great uncertainty as to the future
structure of the group, with speculation of asset sales and/or a debt for
equity swap involving the major creditor banks. Clarification would have to
wait for a shareholders meeting that could be held before the end of the
month.
Montedison slid L47 to close at L980 before improving slightly on the kerb
to L992.
The telecommunications sector was particularly active on foreign buying
after the government said that it would accelerate the privatisation
process: Stet advanced L94 to L3,244, then to L3,300 on the kerb, while Sip
put on L57 to L2,146.
PARIS fell back from the day's high although activity was subdued in the
absence of Frankfurt. The CAC-40 index slipped 4.01 to 1,911.22 in turnover
of FFr2.4bn.
A rate cut of between 25-50 basis points is expected soon, with some brokers
predicting Monday as the likely date.
LVMH fell back FFr27 to FFr3,683 after forecasting lower first half profits,
while Suez, up FFr5.50 at FFr297, remained active on hopes of resolving its
shareholding conflict with UAP, down FFr8 at FFr575.
AMSTERDAM closed mixed in active trading. The CBS Tendency and most blue
chips were slightly firmer, the index ending 0.3 better at 107.3. But the
day's most active stock, ING, dropped Fl 3.60 to Fl 62.90 as analysts
decided that unchanged first quarter net profits per share from the
financial services group were about 10 per cent off the expected level.
BRUSSELS featured strong advances in the chemical blue chip, Solvay, and the
holding company Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) as the Bel-20 index rose
5.5 to 1,212.94.
Solvay built on Wednesday's gains, up another BFr175 to BFr11,775, while SGB
put on BFr45 to BFr2,150 as its non-ferrous metals unit, Union Miniere
closed BFr55 higher at BFr2,135, helped by the strength of the dollar.
ZURICH saw another SFr60 rise to SFr1,700 in Surveillance on its share
buy-back plan, for a two-day gain of SFr160, as the SMI index eased 2.2 to
2,309.2. MADRID extended its technical recovery, the general index closing
1.26 higher at 257.55 in modest turnover of Pta14.4bn.
HELSINKI liked the interim reports from Instrumentarium and Okobank and made
a technical rebound. The HEX index, which had fallen by nearly 12 per cent
since its 1993 high three weeks ago, rose by 23.5, or 2.1 per cent to
1,122.77 in turnover of FM80m.
Dealers said that the recovery was fragile but, in London, Mr David Roche of
Morgan Stanley rated the market as cheap by all measures except earnings -
and, there, he expected the dramatic declines of recent years to be reversed
by devaluation and falling interest rates over this year and next.
ISTANBUL rose again on heavy press speculation that the former economics
minister Mrs Tansu Ciller, seen as a keen supporter of the bourse, would
become the new prime minister. The market index climbed 149.37, or 1.75 per
cent to this week's second all-time closing high of 8,687.16.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok reels after SEC attack on
share-riggers - Meanwhile, writes William Barnes, the economic and corporate
fundamentals have deteriorated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockbrokers surveying the gloom that has overshadowed the Stock Exchange of
Thailand for most of this year now comfort themselves with the thought that
sentiment cannot get much worse.
At the beginning of the year, the SET index looked like breaking through the
1,000-point barrier, supported by what appeared to be strong corporate
earnings.
But, since then, every attempt by the market to move up has been thwarted by
bad news; this has culminated in the realisation that corporate earnings are
likely to be swimming through mud for the rest of the year.
In spite of a rise this week, the index closed yesterday at 844.01, down
1.87 on the day, compared with a peak of 998.44 in Janauary.
The new year optimism among Thailand's notoriously volatile domestic
investors quickly evaporated as the one-year-old Securities and Exchange
Commission continued to pursue suspected share price riggers and corporate
smoke-and-mirrors specialists; share rampers, it is said, have at least had
the merit of being able to lead the Thai market a merry, if rather
dangerous, dance.
By April the market's collective nerve steadied and the market greeted the
much anticipated SEC announcement that police had been asked to prosecute 30
suspected share-rampers almost with relief.
Then, by accident or design, the names of a further 123 suspect investors
were leaked to the press and the index dropped 6.2 per cent in five days.
No sooner had the index struggled from the depths of 840 and into the 890s -
as it became clear that the 123 would not be prosecuted - than companies
started releasing their first-quarter results and the index weakened to set
a 1993 low of 818.84 ten days ago.
Mr Rob Collins, head of research for Asia Equity, says: 'The first-quarter
earnings were truly disastrous and everyone got very depressed. Speculation
had been taken out of the market (by the SEC's crackdown) and then we had
the the fundamentals knocked for six.'
At the beginning of this year, the Bank of Thailand's 7.8 GDP growth
forecast looked quite reasonable; now, some pessimists have begun to talk of
growth of less than 6 per cent - a figure not seen since the mid-1980s.
Earlier hopes that Thailand could ride out the global slowdown, and the cost
of its own heavy investment in increased capacity in everything from
manufacturing to hotels, had to be sharply readjusted.
Asia Equity reckons that, of 310 listed companies, the first-quarter results
show that less than a dozen are genuinely flush with profits, after
stripping out the still lucrative banking sector, the new listings which
habitually jump from profit minimisation to profit maximisation, and
companies which 'massage' their results.
Local investors have drawn some comfort from this week's lacklustre
no-confidence debate in parliament - a 'joke', according to the head of one
Thai securities house - which helped to set aside worries that the current
five-party coalition government might break up.
There has also been a flurry of excitement in the handful of recent new
listings and warrant issues.
Warrants of the respected property company, Land and Houses, traded nearly
their entire issue when they hit the market on Wednesday - helping to boost
trading volumes to around Bt5bn, compared with the duller trading of around
Bt3bn seen over the last two months.
Shares in the government's oil and gas producer PTT Exploration and
Production jumped from a striking price of Bt33 to close at Bt47.5 on high
volume after its first trading session yesterday.
It will probably require substantial fundamental good news for these shafts
of speculative light to dispel the gloom much before the end of 1993.
However, with the long-term outlook for the Thai economy still regarded as
excellent, some investors are cautiously picking up long-term growth plays.
A dose of corporate realism may have done more to turn Thai investors into
enthusiasts for quality than all the efforts of the eager SEC.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls in
low volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices lost ground for the fourth consecutive day as a stronger yen,
and caution ahead of the futures and options expiry today, kept investors on
the sidelines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 81.92 at 20,493.32, after an early high of 20,618.31
on buying by investment funds and a low of 20,399.56 later in the morning on
arbitrage selling. The index recouped some of its fall in the afternoon on
small-lot buying by public funds.
Volume was an estimated 270m shares, the lowest since March 5. Declines led
rises by 678 to 336, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 2.77 to 1,652.26. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
edged ahead 1.12 to 1,243.10.
Investors were also wary of taking positions before the release today of the
Bank of Japan's tankan, its quarterly report on business sentiment.
After a brief fall to below the Y106 level, the dollar closed Y0.13 down at
Y106.20, a new Tokyo low. Some high-technology exporters were hit by fears
of lower profits: Sony lost Y20 to Y4,560.
However, power utilities, importers of fuel, were higher, with Kansai
Electric Power up Y40 to Y2,920 and Kyushu Electric Power up Y70 to Y2,950.
Regional banks were also stronger on small-lot buying by foreign investors.
Shiga Bank advanced Y24 to Y834 and Bank Ryukyus added Y180 at Y7,500.
However, some city banks were lower on technical trading: Mitsubishi Bank
slipped Y20 to Y2,720.
Speculators focused on Aids-related issues. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y50
to Y2,950 on a report that the World Health Organisation had announced that
Mochida's anti-Aids interferon drug was ineffective. Olympus Optical, whose
US joint venture was reported to have developed Aids-detecting equipment,
put on Y20 at Y1,280.
On the over-the-counter market, THK, the bearings maker which plunged
earlier this week on rumours of financial problems due to stock speculation,
recovered Y20 to Y2,140. Traders said the rise was partly due to support by
a leading broker. Baring Securities said that, aside from fears of hidden
liabilities, THK faces a drop in operating margins due to the recession and
higher yen.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 111.84 to 23,006.91 in volume of 14.5m
shares.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence yesterday among the Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG lost ground on selected profit-taking in thin trading. The Hang
Seng index dipped 78.50, or 1.1 per cent, to 7,260.58 as turnover shrank to
HKDollars 3.77bn from HKDollars 4.69bn.
Among the actives, Cheung Kong receded 20 cents to HKDollars 27.60 and China
Light HK1 to HKDollars 39.25. HSBC was steady at HKDollars 72.50 and Hang
Seng Bank shed 50 cents.
SEOUL was subjected to profit-taking following strong gains earlier this
week. The composite index retreated a net 3.86 to 773.39, after a day's high
of 787.60. Turnover was a record Won1,344bn.
TAIWAN saw a decline in financial stocks pull the weighted index 46.71 lower
to 4,223.01 in TDollars 16.94bn turnover.
MANILA slid for the third day in succession, marked by confusion over the
closing date for Manila Electric's 60 per cent dividend declaration.
Trading in Manila Electric was suspended until the issue is settled. The
composite index shed 5.38 to 1,576.46 in turnover of 327.3m pesos.
AUSTRALIA recovered to close slightly higher after being dragged lower
earlier by the weaker gold bullion price.
The All Ordinaries index finished 3.4 ahead at 1,712.5 in turnover of
ADollars 278.5m. May unemployment data showing little change from the
previous month, and a strong futures market, helped to swing the market
around.
BOMBAY moved up on short-covering, the BSE index gaining 44.98 at 2,396.01.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Fading hopes in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of another base rate cut in the UK faded even more yesterday after the
governor-designate of the Bank of England said inflationary pressures in
Britain were far from dead, writes James Blitz.
Mr Eddie George said in a speech on Wednesday evening that another base rate
reduction would not stimulate the UK economy, but might lead to higher
prices.
At any time, this might have prompted some unwinding of bullishness about a
rate cut. But the market was partic-ularly depressed by these comments at
the end of a day in which Mr Norman Lamont, the former UK chancellor, had
warned Mr John Major's government not to indulge in any politically inspired
interest rate cuts.
As one dealer said yesterday: 'It is now very hard to believe that the
government could get away with another rate cut this year.' Underlining the
depressed mood was a poor performance from sterling on the currency markets,
following Wednesday's strong rise.
The June short sterling contract fell to 94.00 at one stage but closed
unchanged at 94.03, a level in line with the unchanged three-month cash rate
at 5 15/16 per cent. The September contract finished 4 basis points down at
94.15. A daily shortage of Pounds 900m was easily removed, with two-thirds
of the funds provided in the early round.
European markets were very quiet with Germany away on holiday. French franc
futures fell back slightly yesterday in a move that appeared to follow the
weakness in Euromarks the day before, when the Bundesbank left its repo rate
unchanged. The September Pibor contract ended 5 basis points off at 93.32.
The near-term outlook for German rate cuts still looks bleak because of the
weakness of the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
However, Mr Norbert Walter, Deutsche Bank's chief economist, yesterday
predicted that official German interest rates would be reduced on July 1
when the Bundesbank Council hold its last fortnightly meeting before its
summer vacation.
Mr Walter also said that there would be a new European interest rate pattern
in place by the beginning of next month in which France and the Netherlands
would lead interest rates lower, rather than Germany.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen rises on eve of talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN continued to appreciate against the dollar yest-erday, touching a
new high against the US currency as dealers awaited the result of today's
trade talks between the US and Japan, writes James Blitz.
US officials will probably call for a scaling down of Japan's huge trade
surplus at the meeting, and will make tough demands which Japanese officials
may be unwilling to accept.
There was no significant news relating to the talks yesterday. But dealers
continued to believe that the US administration was happy to see the yen
appreciate, and that intervention from the Federal Reserve to hold down the
Japanese currency had been slight.
After touching Y105.95 to the dollar at one stage, the yen ended in London
yesterday at Y106.20 from a previous Y106.55. In New York the dollar
finished at Y106.05.
Mr Julian Callow, an international economist at Kleinwort Benson in London,
said the Y100 to the dollar level was almost certain to be reached. But he
thought there could be some short term retracement over the next few days.
Today's tankan business report from the Bank of Japan may show that the
strong yen rise is hurting Japanese exporters, reducing fundamental support
for the currency.
By contrast, the dollar remained well underpinned against a generally weak
D-Mark, touching DM1.6403 in Europe before closing lower at DM1.6340. It
ended New York trading at DM1.6285.
The dollar's recent strength is the product of last week's very good payroll
report for May. In Mr Callow's view, the rise in US payrolls, up 209,000 on
the month, indicated that second-quarter GDP in the US was at an annualised
4 per cent - and this suggested that the very low US growth seen in the
first three months of the year was a blip.
The market's main concern today will be with the US producer price data for
May, which will probably determine the near term outlook for the US
currency.
Most dealers are expecting a monthly rise in the order of plus 0.1 per cent,
well down from the April figure of plus 0.6 per cent. A higher figure might
prompt the Fed to lean towards raising short-term interest rates, reducing
the comparative premium for investors holding D-Marks.
The dollar could also be affected today by the US retail sales figures for
May. The market is expecting a 0.7 per cent rise on the month. But if the
figure is weaker than this, it may make it harder for the Fed to justify a
rate rise.
Sterling yesterday held steadily against the D-Mark and the dollar, in spite
of the increasing uncertainty surrounding the future of Mr John Major, the
UK prime minister.
For the last two days, dealers have shrugged off the attack launched on Mr
Major by Mr Norman Lamont, his former chancellor. The pound closed unchanged
at DM2.4825.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palm oil smooths Malaysia's
troubled waters - The one bright spot in the country's troubled plantations
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE bad times for Malaysia's commodity producers. Rubber and cocoa
growers, reeling from a prolonged period of low world prices, are going out
of business. Tin output has fallen by nearly 50 per cent in the last two
years, with miners despairing of ever seeing a return to higher prices and
profitable production. Palm oil is the one bright spot.
Malaysia is the world's biggest palm oil producer by far. In 1992 Malaysia
it more than 6.3m tonnes, accounting for about 55 per cent of total world
output. And palm oil is now one of Malaysia's biggest export items, with
export revenues of more than MDollars 6bn (USDollars 2.3bn) last year.
Prices have been generally buoyant with crude palm oil fetching between
MDollars 880-950 a tonne on the Kuala Lumpur palm oil exchange, compared
with average production costs of between MDollars 450-650 a tonne.
While rubber and cocoa production is contracting, Malaysia's planners have
ambitious plans for the palm oil sector. Forecasts put production this year
at 6.8m tonnes, rising to 7.5m tonnes by 1995 and to 9m tonnes by the year
2000.
This compares with production of only 51,000 tonnes in 1950 when less than
40,000 hectares was planted with palm oil. Now the crop is planted on about
2m hectares, mainly in peninsula Malaysia.
There are those who worry that palm oil risks the same fate as other
commodities, with fast expanding production creating oversupply and thereby
causing low prices. But producers point to the growing penetration of palm
oil in the world oil and fats market.
In 1980 palm oil accounted for about 20 per cent of the world edible oil and
fats market: it now has a 33 per cent share.
Mr Borge Bek-Nielsen runs 94,000 acres of plantations - mostly planted with
palm oil - on the west coast of peninsula Malaysia. A Dane who has been in
the palm oil business in Malaysia since the early 1950s, he is known as the
country's palm oil king.
'Palm oil now has far greater acceptance in the market,' he says. 'In terms
of world consumption it has overtaken sunflower and rapeseed oils and by the
end of the decade will have surpassed soyabean.'
Malaysia recently became involved in a bitter battle with US soyabean
growers, who alleged that palm oil was potentially dangerous to health. Mr
Bek-Nielsen says this was a blatant campaign to try to stop palm oil's
invasion of US soyabean markets. 'Palm oil is one of the healthiest oils,'
he insists, 'we are winning the health battle, that's for sure.'
But other battles and other problems beset the Malaysian palm oil industry.
There is a constant need to explore new markets. India was once Malaysia's
biggest palm oil buyer. Now its purchases have virtually ceased as it has
become self-sufficient in vegetable oil production. In 1989 the former
Soviet Union imported more than 400,000 tonnes of Malaysian palm oil: last
year, because of its economic problems, it only imported slightly more than
20,000 tonnes.
To encourage more palm oil sales the Malaysian government has instituted an
extended credit scheme for purchasers. Pakistan, Algeria, Iran, Egypt, Iran,
China and the US have now become big markets.
Europe as a whole imported 1.7m tonnes of Malaysian palm oil last year:
Malaysia continues to lobby for the abolition of European Community import
duties of 12 per cent on processed palm oil and 4 per cent on crude.
'All this talk of free trade means nothing when there are such duties,' says
Mr Bek-Nielsen. 'Yet at the same time the EC gives vast subsidies to its
rapeseed farmers. Rapeseed is sold at about half the cost of production to
India, Pakistan, China, Japan and elsewhere, meaning that EC taxpayers'
money is being used to undercut our palm oil exports. The US Export
Enhancement Program is also against the principles of free trade. It is very
unfair.'
As part of its programme to encourage more downstream, value-adding
enterprises, the Malaysian government ensures that most palm oil is exported
in processed form.
Now there are suggestions that to open up new markets Malaysia export more
crude palm oil in order to avoid the higher duties most countries put on
processed oil.
Some Malaysian producers have already set up palm oil refineries overseas.
But most of these are forced to buy their crude feedstock from outside
Malaysia. The refining lobby within Malaysia is politically very strong: the
refiners say multi-million dollar investments would be wiped out if more
crude was allowed to be exported.
Securing markets is vital in view of the increased competition coming from
neighbouring Indonesia. Indonesia's palm oil output, once the world's
biggest, declined in the post second world war years. But now it is
increasing dramatically - from 691,000 tonnes in 1980 to nearly 3m tonnes
last year. It is forecast that by 2010 Indonesia will be producing 12.3m
tonnes - ahead of forecast Malaysian production in the same year of 11m
tonnes.
Ironically part of the reason for the resurgence of Indonesian palm oil is
Malaysian official policy. When Kuala Lumpur began localising its plantation
industry in the late 1960s, phasing out foreign companies and managers, many
planters decamped across the water to Indonesia, taking their expertise with
them.
Indonesia has a ready supply of land available for palm oil plantations: its
government has subsidised fertilisers and other inputs to the industry; and,
most importantly, it has an abundant supply of cheap labour.
Estate workers cost three times as much in Malaysia as in Indonesia.
Malaysia is fast industrialising: workers, particularly the young, are
leaving the estate sector for urban areas and what they consider to be less
arduous jobs.
'Labour is our big problem,' says Mr Bek-Nielsen. 'On some of our estates 70
per cent are foreign workers. Many just come for a few months, get their
training, but then leave for the towns or cities.'
Efforts are being made to bring in more mechanisation: all Mr Bek-Nielsen's
estates have narrow gauge railway systems linking planted areas with on-site
refineries. Aerial fertiliser spraying has also cut down labour
requirements. But harvesting of the palm oil bunches still has to be by
hand.
'We provide housing and all sorts of amenities on our plantations, we even
have an old folks home,' says Mr Bek-Nielsen. (There is also a Danish
bakery).
The plantations object to paying a MDollars 300 government levy for every
foreign worker employed. 'Many of these workers end up in various
industries,' says Mr Bek-Nielsen. 'In a way we are subsidising the
industrial sector. Palm oil is the oil of the future, that's for sure. But
the government has to help the agricultural industry. If not Malaysia is
going to miss out on vital opportunities.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: E German perlite plan targets
builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OTAVI MINEN, a subsidiary of the British-based Cookson Group, will double
its production of perlite in eastern Germany in a move aimed at targeting
the expanding construction industry.
The company, the third largest in Europe, recently invested DM9.8m (Pounds
4m) in building a modern perlite insulation plant at Buelstringen, near
Magdeburg. Perlite, which is extracted from the perlite surface mines on the
Greek island of Milos, is used for insulation material between walls of
houses and offices and in roof coverings.
The decision to locate in eastern Germany stems partly from the steady
expansion in the construction sector, as well as transportation costs -
perlite is a very light commodity. By locating the plant in the middle of
its market, Cookson intends to gain a sizeable foothold in eastern Germany,
as well as complement its western German operations.
The Buelstringen is already producing 30,000 tonnes a year with a staff of
14. Cookson expects to double its staff and boost output by 80,000 tonnes to
120,000 tonnes by 1994.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait stands aside from Opec
deal to roll over output ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS OF the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in
Geneva, last night agreed to roll over the official output ceiling but were
forced to leave Kuwait outside the agreement. The emirate will thus be free
to go ahead with its plan to raise its production by 400,000 barrels a day,
putting more pressure on the depressed oil market.
Earlier in the day, as ministers tried to battle out a compromise that would
give a positive signal to the market, Kuwait came under increasing pressure
to back down on its demand for a large increase in its share of Opec oil
production.
The insistence by Mr Ali Ahmed al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister, that the
emirate see a rise in its share of output to 2m b/d from the present 1.6m
b/d had already weakened prices. But Mr al-Baghli had his hands tied by
Kuwait's newly-elected parliament, which was committed to a quota increase.
Iran headed the opposing camp and was strongly resisting any increase in
production because of price weakness. At the same time, Tehran was reluctant
to agree to a deal that would set a precedent for giving one country
preferential treatment.
Behind a lot of the negotiating lay the fear that any precedent set at the
meeting could be exploited by Iraq when it returned to production. Fears
over Iraq's re-entry into the market had also prompted ministers to push for
a high market share now so that they could cut back from as high a level as
possible when Baghdad returned.
Iran was not alone in resisting a production increase for Kuwait but others
such as Venezuela and Nigeria were prepared to tolerate a moderate rise of
140,000 b/d to 170,000 b/d. Kuwait, however, was making no concessions on
its demands, which meant that the emirate ended by being left out of the
final agreement.
That is likley to weaken sentiment in the market and push prices down, but
any fall could be shortlived.
Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company in
Washington suggested before the meeting closed that with a good agreement,
West Texas prices would swiftly rise up to Dollars 20.50 to Dollars 21 a
barrel until the first signs that the agreement was not holding and then
they would slip.
But with a bad agreement, he said, prices would fall initially to Dollars 19
(from the present level of about Dollars 19.60 a barrel) and stay there.
'It's just a question of where the psychology takes you before it brings you
back to earth,' he explained.
A Saudi Arabian official said the kingdom was 'strongly committed' to the
agreement and added that it believed that 'everyone will respect it".
Output is already running much higher than the 23.582m b/d ceiling at 24.2m
b/d and analysts believe it will rise still further to touch 24.8m b/d in
the third quarter.
Prices are unlikely to rise substantially in coming months and North Sea
Brent crude oil is trading at Dollars 18.30 a barrel with not much lift in
sight. While oil demand in the Far East remains strong, European consumption
has shown few signs of picking up and US demand looks more uncertain. The
market fundamentals will keep the pressure mounting for Opec's ministers.

INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation consumer members were yesterday assessing
producers' ideas on a new international accord as both groups met separately
in London, reports Reuter.
Producers favour a pact based on a production and consumption policy, with
controlled liquidation of the 232,000-tonne buffer stock.
Consumers were surprised by the producers' proposal to liquidate the buffer
stock, as that would seem certain to push prices even lower.
But a producer delegate said: 'Producers see the fundamental situation
continuing to move towards larger and larger deficits over the next few
years and they would prefer to get it over and done with now'.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tunisia seeks bigger EC olive
oil quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SADDLED WITH unprecedented surplus stocks of olive oil, Tunisia has asked
the European Community to raise its annual export quota to the EC from
46,000 to 60,000 tonnes. The stocks, amounting to 200,000 tonnes, are the
consequence of the largest olive production recorded in the country's
history which, for the 1991-92 season, amounted to 270,000 tonnes.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that the five countries accounting
for more than 90 per cent of the world's production of olive oil - Italy,
Spain, France, Greece and Tunisia - all recorded a bumper crop at the same
time, thus pushing up total world production last year by more than one
third to 2.2m tonnes.
Tunisia pays a tariff of Ecu5-10 (Pounds 3.95-Pounds 7.90) per 100
kilogrammes of olive oil, compared with Ecu55 for exports by Moroccan and
Turkish, which have no quotas because the amounts are small.
One of the key reasons why Tunisia cannot gain a bigger EC quota is that
community members pay their own producers large subsidies.
For Tunisia the olive oil industry is vital. The product accounts for 8 per
cent of total Tunisian export earnings and 42 per cent of the value of all
food exports.

output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATURAL GAS production from the Danish sector of the North Sea will be
doubled to about 7bn cubic metres a year as a result of an agreement signed
here.
The deal was made between the state's gas distribution company, Dansk
Naturgas, and Danish Underground Consortium, a venture between AP Moller,
Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco, which is the licence holder for the country's
North Sea gas fields.
Most of the additional gas produced will be sold to Germany under the terms
of agreement between Dansk Naturgas and Germany's Ruhrgas and BEB for
delivery of 2.5bn cu m a year from the end of 1996.
The expansion of gas production will require investments totalling DKr17bn
(Pounds 1.8bn), said A. P. Moller, including investments of more than DKr2bn
by Dansk Naturgas for the processing, transport and storage of the
additional quantities of natural gas.
Danish natural gas production in 1992 was 3.5bn cu m. DUC had earlier
contracted to sell a total of 93bn cubic meters to Dansk Naturgas, of which
20bn has already been delivered.
The new agreement does not cover a fixed quantity of gas, but on the
assumption that production of 7bn cubic meters a year can be maintained over
12 years, the agreement would cover about 35bn cu m to a value of
DKr20bn-30bn, said DUC.

cash for trash

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, the world's biggest commodities exchange, is
teaming up with a major US recycling group in an experiment to create an
organised cash market for recyclable materials.
The exchange expects to offer markets in glass and two types of plastic on a
screen-based trading system within a year. Spot trading in different paper
grades may be added if the initial markets are successful.
Patrick Arbor, the CBoT's chairman, said the same principles that created
the exchange's massive grain markets should apply to recyclables. 'The
problems which currently frustrate commerce between collectors, processors
and end-users of recyclable materials are similar to those which plagued the
grain market for which the CBoT was founded in 1848,' he said.
Noting that municipalities and other collectors were accustomed to handing
glass and plastics as waste, rather than commodities, Ms. Kathleen Meade, of
the Washington-based Recycling Advisory Council, which is co-operating on
the project, said the CBoT market would help to standardise the products.
The exchange, working with an industry committee, will develop quality and
delivery specifications and rules for resolving trade disputes.

GOLD closed below Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
after failing to break resistance on the upside at Dollars 372. Dealers said
the market was just looking for new direction. 'The market is so evenly
poised than any bit of information that comes out will tip it one way or the
other,' one said. Some chart analysts were predicting a further drop down to
Dollars 365 to fill a chart gap. But in the longer term most felt that,
although gold's uptrend had certainly lost momentum, the current period of
consolidation would not last too long. Base metals lost early gains under
the influence of a collapsing COPPER price on the London Metal Exchange, and
by the close most were trading in the minus column. 'Recent rises have been
purely based on technicals and are proving to be rather fragile,' one trader
said. Three-month copper rose early to Dollars 1,867 a tonne as short
covering was prompted by Wednesday's late rise on Comex. But there was no
follow-through in London, or when Comex opened yesterday, and this swiftly
undermined buyers' confidence. Liquidation took the price down to Dollars
1,840 at the close, up just Dollars 6 from Wednesday.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries becalmed ahead of inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPREHENSION ahead of today's all-important inflation data left US Treasury
markets becalmed yesterday as most dealers and investors chose to stay on
the sidelines, fearing a possible interest rate hike if the figures show
prices rising farther than expected.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 103
5/32 , yielding 6.871 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was unchanged at 99, to yield 4.275 per cent.
Fears that a resurgence in inflation could persuade the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates has dominated trading all week, and yesterday the
market's anxiety deepened.
This was partly due to recent remarks by one of the Fed governors, Mr
Lawrence Lindsay, who said on Wednesday that some governors might be willing
temporarily to put up rates to indicate the Federal Reserve's preparedness
to tackle inflation.
Trading was especially quiet yesterday because the producer prices index for
May is released today.
If the index, which will give the market the latest reading on inflation,
shows a rise of no more than 0.2 per cent (as forecast by Wall Street
analysts), investors and traders will be able to breathe a sigh of relief.
An increase significantly larger than forecast, however, could trigger a
tightening of monetary policy and a sharp downward correction in bond
prices. If the data is unconvincing in either direction, then the market is
likely to hold its ground until next week, when the May consumer prices
index is published.
GERMAN government bonds rallied yesterday, taking heart from comments by Mr
Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank Council, concerning money supply
growth.
Mr Issing said the rapid growth in April of M3, the measure of money in
circulation, which sent a shiver through the German bond market at the time
of its release, was unlikely to have continued in May.
Although the German market was closed yesterday, the news had a positive
impact on bund trading in London. The futures contract, which weakened at
first, later picked up on Mr Issing's comments and ended the day in London
around 0.20 higher at 94.72.
IN LONDON, UK government bonds saw an early two-way pull but the optimists
won the day and the long gilt futures contract closed  1/4 point higher at
104.16.
Wednesday's resignation attack on the government by Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, revived concerns over political stability but was seen
more as a reason for staying away from the market than an impetus to sell.
Moreover, overseas investors were tempted by the weakness of sterling and
there was some switching out of the French government bond market - which
has been a very strong performer recently - into gilts.
In the afternoon there was some domestic buying on the belief that gilts
have been oversold.
Dealers said that prices were softer at the short end of the yield curve as
Mr Eddie George, the governor-in-waiting of the Bank of England, sought to
dampen enthusiasm for a near-term cut in base rates.
FRENCH government bonds sustained their recent rise in spite of investors
switching funds into the UK government bond market. The June futures
contract on the Matif followed the performance of the bund market, closing
0.18 higher at 118.18 and gaining further in after-hours trading.
Some economists were beginning to consider OATS over-priced and felt that
the spread over 10-year bunds might start to widen again, having narrowed to
as little as 16 basis points. However, BZW, in its latest bond review,
believes long-term French yields will move below those in Germany within the
next six months.
HIGH-yielding European markets were weak yesterday, with Spanish government
bond prices slipping back after the rises that followed the general election
at the weekend.
Italy's BTP futures fell 15 basis points to 100.05, responding in part to a
weaker lira and also to concerns about the outcome of regional elections.
JAPANESE government bond yields fell ahead of the release today of the key
economic review. Most analysts expect the Tankan quarterly review from the
Bank of Japan to show a weak economic picture and that, combined with the
record strength of the yen, is likely to add weight to the argument in
favour of an interest rate cut.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB fell two basis points to 4.48 per cent
in London and Japanese government bond futures rose 0.06 to 107.89 as what
one dealer decribed as 'rate cut fever' gathered pace.

securities firms

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S securities firms ran up record profits in the first three months of
this year, with a strong performance in almost every part of their business.
The Investment Dealers Association reported that 132 firms posted net
first-quarter earnings of CDollars 168m (USDollars 131m), up by 87 per cent
from a year earlier. Revenues grew by 34 per cent to CDollars 4.9bn.
First-quarter 1993 profits equalled about two-thirds of the total for 1992.
A further encouraging sign for the industry is that employment, at almost
20,400, has returned to its highest level since 1989.
According to the IDA, the strong growth has stemmed from both retail and
institutional business, and from debt and equity markets. Financial advisory
services, underwriting and securities trading have boomed in recent months.
Mutual funds have been an especially fast-growing part of Canadian financial
markets. Mutual fund sales made up a fifth of the securities industry's
first-quarter commission revenues, compared with only 4 per cent five years
ago. Underwriting fees jumped by 66 per cent.
The profits of individual firms are not disclosed. However, several of
Canada's big six banks recently singled out their investment banking
subsidiaries as major contributors to their earnings for the quarter to
April 30.
RBC Dominion Securities, the country's biggest brokerage firm, which is 76
per cent-owned by Royal Bank of Canada, posted a quarterly profit of almost
CDollars 30m.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Lasmo issues Dollars 250m of
preference shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the UK oil company, has launched a Dollars 250m issue of perpetual
cumulative preference shares, with a gross dividend of 10 per cent, in the
US market. The deal is being arranged by Merrill Lynch.
The issue is made up of 10m shares with a nominal value of Dollars 25 per
share and is callable after five years.
The deal virtually completes the refinancing of the bank debt taken on by
Lasmo in connection with its acquisition of Ultramar. Lasmo had already
raised Dollars 350m through a Yankee bond issue at the end of last month.
The issue will be treated as equity in Lasmo's balance sheet for the purpose
of computing balance sheet gearing. Because the proceeds are being used to
repay debt, the financing will substantially reduce the company's gearing.
Mr Michael Pavia, finance director of Lasmo, said that the refinancing has
helped extend the average maturity of the company's debt to 8 1/2 years,
from 5 1/2 years as at the end of last year.
As part of the company's efforts to broaden the distribution of its shares
in the US, its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on
Wednesday.
ALSO in the US preferred stock market, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the Spanish
bank, has launched a Dollars 200m issue of preference shares, its third such
offering.
Unusually, the non-cumulative preference shares will also be offered in
Europe. In particular, underwriters are targeting Spanish investors. The
securities will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will form one
single global tranche.
The preference share issue, arranged by Kidder Peabody, counts as Tier 1
capital under new bank capital rules. The deal is expected to be priced next
week, to offer a dividend of 8-8 1/8 per cent.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Bonds: French borrowers find strong demand for
FFr37bn of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE new issues totalling FFr37bn, were launched in the French franc
sector, yesterday, all for French borrowers, reflecting the lack of
arbitrage opportunities available in the market.
Swap spreads have narrowed to a point where only borrowers willing to lock
into fixed-rate French francs are likely to find the market attractive.
However, international investor demand for French bonds remains strong,
particularly at the medium and longer maturities, given the firm tone of the
government bond market.
Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the AAA-rated French agency, launched a
FFr1.7bn six-year deal via Credit Commercial de France, priced to yield 20
basis points over the comparable French government bond, while Credit
Lyonnais arranged FFr1bn of five-year Eurobonds for its parent.
A FFr1bn seven-year deal for Eurodif, a French uranium company, was
structured as a Eurobond but the unrated paper, for a company little known
outside France, was targeted mainly at domestic investors, dealers said.
In the dollar sector, a Dollars 150m five-year issue for Eli Lilly, the US
pharmaceuticals company, was rapidly sold out, due to its rarity value - it
has not tapped the Eurobond market since 1985 - and its AAA rating. The
launch spread of 15 basis points had tightened by several basis points by
the end of the day, according to lead manager Morgan Stanley.
Also in the dollar sector, Iceland launched a Dollars 125m issue of
five-year bonds arranged by Goldman Sachs.
Banco Comercial became the first borrower from Uruguay, apart from the
government which recently came to the market, to tap the Eurobond market.
The small Dollars 40m issue arranged by CSFB was well received, according to
dealers.
Banca Cremi, the Mexican bank, is planning to launch a USDollars 150m,
two-year Eurobond shortly, lead-managed by Banco Santander de Negocios,
writes Sara Webb.
Banca Cremi is Mexico's ninth largest bank in terms of total assets and was
privatised in 1991. It will use the proceeds to refinance existing debt.
Santander said it is looking at a yield spread of about 450 basis points
over US Treasuries. Banca Cremi did a USDollars 50m three-year bond issue in
October 1992 which was priced to yield 490 basis points over the US Treasury
bond.
'The bond issue is meant to increase the duration of debt and introduce
Cremi to the international financial community,' said one of the bankers
involved in the deal.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Beijing attempts to ease
traders' worries - Rapid growth has prompted concern over futures regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEIRDRE NICKERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proliferation of capital and commodity markets in China is proving a
bonanza for financial information service companies. However, the rapid
growth has prompted concern among traders that the lax regulatory
environment may threaten market development.
Companies like Reuters and Telerate are witnessing explosive growth, much of
which can be attributed to futures trading. 'These companies provide a
service which is critical to the trade. The next step is to provide the
service in Chinese,' says China MinMetals, China's largest metal trader.
Faced with a backlog of orders, both Telerate and Reuters are racing to keep
up with demand. 'We are experiencing tremendous growth, but it will peak
this year,' says Mr David Feng, Tele-rate's general manager for north-east
Asia.
Mr Feng says: 'The information service companies have put futures trading in
proper order because of their ability to provide accurate information on a
real-time basis. This increases the liquidity of the market.'
The two financial information companies compete head-on. Industry sources
say Reuters has captured a bigger share of foreign exchange dealing
services, while Telerate has the advantage in equities trading, especially
in southern China.
However, the dramatic increase in the number of securities and futures
brokerage houses throughout China is providing enormous opportunities for
both companies.
Last year, China opened eight futures markets which registered a total trade
volume of more than 55.8bn yuan (Dollars 9.8bn) for the year. The Shanghai
Metals Exchange witnessed its busiest day to date last month, with more than
5bn yuan worth of transactions in one day, against volume of 153.4bn yuan
for the first 12 months of operation.
Since they cannot retrieve hard currency, foreign trading houses do not
participate directly in China's futures trade. 'Once the yuan becomes
convertible the situation will improve,' says MinMetals. Local brokers earn
hard currency by acting as intermediaries between domestic customers and
foreign futures exchanges. China MinMetals' foreign trading, for example, is
concentrated on the London Metals Exchange.
Traders' worries include the lack of regulations and the absence of
standardised contracts.
'So far we have lots of customers, lots of interest and markets with huge
potential, but we don't have laws or an enforcement body and we need this as
soon as possible,' says China International Futures (CIFCO), China's largest
futures brokerage.
Last month the State Administration for Industry and Commerce announced new
regulations calling for the re-registration of all futures brokerages.
Brokerages have to meet a set of regulations, including proof of 10m yuan in
registered capital, a minimum of 20 full-time brokers, an efficient
accounting system, and necessary floor space with adequate communications.
'This action is only the beginning, but hopefully it will extinguish the
activities of the large number of illegal traders. Most of the exchanges
still need to develop standardised contracts and proper clearing systems.
The establishment of a body to take on this task under the direction of the
State Council would be a large step in the right direction,' says MinMetals.
It is difficult to say when this will happen. Many exchanges are still using
forwarding contracts and have not made the jump to futures contracts,
although many analysts believe this will take place within the year.
The recent rapid growth of futures markets is a direct reflection of
economic reform. Previously, futures were frowned on because of of their
speculative nature. Today, shareholders in CIFCO, which started up as
recently as December, include government ministries and large state-run
investment companies.

SHARES in PTT Exploration and Production, the Thai oil and gas company, rose
sharply above their initial public offering price on the first day of
trading on the Thai stock exchange yesterday, giving a much-needed boost to
the government's privatisation plans.
In an otherwise lacklustre market, PTTEP shares peaked at Bt54.50 (Dollars
2.16), up 65 per cent from the Bt33 offering price, before falling back to
Bt47.50 at the close, valuing the company at Bt12.35bn.
PTTEP, 85 per cent owned by the state Petroleum Authority of Thailand, is
the country's first privatisation issue this year and the only listed
exploration and production company.
The 14m shares set aside for non-Thai institutional investors in Asia and
Europe were six times oversubscribed.
PTTEP's performance goes some way towards compensating for Thai Airways
International's poor showing since 7 per cent of its shares were floated
last year; yesterday Thai closed at Bt41.75, compared with its Bt60 initial
public offering price.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, one of the lead co-ordinators and advisers for the
PTTEP issue, says its conservative estimate for the company's net present
value is Bt39 per share.

ANZ is expected to become the first Australian bank to open a branch in

Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is due to announce that ANZ

later this month. Mr Keating is anxious to make commercial relations the
focus of his tour.
ANZ, which has maintained a representative office in Beijing since the
1980s, applied last year to establish a presence in China's biggest
industrial city. Official approval is being advanced to coincide with Mr
Keating's visit.
The Australian prime minister will also announce a ADollars 40m (USDollars
26.9m) chocolate-making joint venture, involving Cadbury Australia and the
Beijing Agricultural Industries Corporation, in what will be the biggest
foray by an Australian-based company into China's food-processing sector.
In Shanghai, Mr Keating will also lay the foundation stone for a new
Foster's brewing plant which is being established in partnership with the
local Huaguang brewery.
BTR Nylex is upgrading a glass-bottling plant in Shanghai that is expected
to supply containers to the Foster's-Huaguang joint venture.
ANZ's decision to establish a foothold in Shanghai seems certain to increase
pressure on other Australian banks to follow suit, but China is not rushing
to approve new licenses.
Foreign banks already present in Shanghai include Bank of America, Citibank
and Banque National de Paris.
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and Standard Chartered Bank maintained a
presence in the port city even during the gloomiest days of the
post-revolution period.
Australian investment in China totalled USDollars 228m in 1992 and should
exceed USDollars 350m by the end of this year.

FINNAIR, Finland's national airline, yesterday announced a steep increase in
its loss for last year and warned that the current 12 months would again be
extremely difficult, Reuter reports from Helsinki. However, the slight
upturn in the Finnish economy gave hope for an improvement, it said.
'The poor domestic market situation means that the 1993-94 financial year
will be tough, but the steps which have been initiated and the slight upturn
in the economy give hope for an improvement,' Finnair said.
For the year ended March, Finnair posted a FM415m (Dollars 75.3m) loss after
financial items, compared with a deficit of FM197m in 1991-92. Turnover was
FM5.46bn, against FM5.44bn. Operating profit before depreciation came to
FM285m, against FM356m. The loss before incidental items and tax was FM367m,
against FM148m.

sharp fall to NKr47m

AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday revealed
a sharp fall in four-month pre-tax profits to NKr47m (Dollars 6.8m) from
NKr332m in the same period last year.
However, last year's figures were helped by a gain of NKr380m from the
disposal of the group's shares in Valenciana, the Spanish cement producer.
'If exceptional items are excluded, the result after financial items is
better than last year,' Aker said. The improvement in the group was mainly
attributed to sharply reduced net financial costs to NKr50m from NKr148m,
due to significant debt repayments last year.
Long-term debt stood at NKr4.23bn at end-April, compared with NKr6.35bn at
the same time last year. Group operating profit improved substantially to
NKr135m from last year's NKr32m.
Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, said he expected a sharp improvement in group
operating profit for 1993.
Sales rose to NKr5.57bn from NKr5.38bn last year as operating costs
increased to NKr5.25bn from NKr4.98bn.
The cement and building materials division saw four-month sales dip to
NKr1.68bn from NKr1.75bn, but achieved a profit after financial items of
NKr30m, against a loss of NKr173m in 1992.
Aker said the improvement was mainly due to a better result in the group's
international cement business, which returned a profit of NKr18m. The
division also made a NKr94m gain on the disposal of a waste treatment plant.
The oil and gas technology division lifted sales to NKr3.66bn from
NKr3.21bn, as profit after financial items rose to NKr105m from NKr94m. Four
companies within the division improved their four-month performance and Aker
expects the division as a whole to achieve a better result this year than it
did in 1992.
Aker's other activities saw turnover reduced sharply to NKr231m from NKr415m
and suffered a loss of NKr48m, compared with a profit of NK342m last year.
Aker blamed the decline on the disposal of Nybro Bjerck and lower sales by
Stord International.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES Hardie Industries, the Australian building products group, is holding
its dividend at 12 cents a share for the year ended March following a sharp
rise in profits, caused mainly by a turnround in abnormal items.
Profits increased to ADollars 56.5m (USDollars 38m) from ADollars 5.9m, on
revenues which rose to ADollars 1.59bn from ADollars 1.55bn.
Before abnormals, earnings fell slightly to ADollars 70.3m from ADollars
72.8m.
The result included an abnormal loss of ADollars 10.4m, well down on the
previous year's loss of ADollars 73.4m. The improvement reflected a
write-back of value in the US fibre operations, which had been written down
in the previous year.
Net earnings were also helped by a fall in the tax bill to ADollars 6.2m
from ADollars 16.5m, mainly through retrospective research and development
claims. Interest expense eased to ADollars 41 from ADollars 49.8m and
depreciation rose to ADollars 52.2m from ADollars 50.3m.
Mr Keith Barton, managing director, said he expected earnings before
interest and tax to rise in the current year,but the improvement would come
from internal efficiencies rather than market growth.

<TEXT>
3M, the Minnesota-based adhesives manufacturer said that a slowdown in US
sales would result in lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
The revised second-quarter outlook hit 3M stock hard with the shares down
Dollars 10 to close on Wall Street at Dollars 105 3/4 . 3M is one of the 30
Dow stocks.
The company's news was seen by some analysts as a sign of renewed weakness
in the US economy. '3M's products are sold to a very broad base of
industry,' said Mr. Alex Henderson, a securities analyst for Prudential
Securities.
In the prepared announcement, Mr L. D. DeSimone, 3M chairman, said:
'Reflecting what appears to be a slowing of the US economy, a majority of
our businesses have experienced slower US growth so far this quarter.'
He said 3M still expects to have second-quarter earnings above the Dollars
317m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, seen a year ago, but the gain will be less
than the company had expected.
Before the announcement, securities analysts had forecast second-quarter
earnings of Dollars 1.55 to Dollars 1.65 per share. That range has now been
revised downward to Dollars 1.40 to Dollars 1.50.
3M is due to release its results for the second quarter on July 30.

AUSTRIAN Industries, the troubled state-owned industrial holding company, is
selling 74 per cent of the equity of its subsidiary, Austria Mikro Systeme
International, a maker of specialised integrated circuits.
The issue marks Austria's first true privatisation. Previous flotations of
state-owned companies have always left majority control in the hands of the
government.
Final pricing has not been fixed, but the issue is expected to value the
company, which makes chips for mobile telephones, factory robots and car
components, at about Sch860m (Dollars 75m).
Of the 1.85m shares in the issue, 43 per cent will be offered to
international investors and 57 per cent to private and institutional
investors in Austria.
Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, global co-ordinator of the issue, and
Kleinwort Benson of London, international lead manager, will be hoping to
avoid repeating the embarrassing aftermath to the last Austrian flotation.
Last November, 49 per cent of the shares of Voest Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme
were floated. Even though VAE exceeded its profit forecast, its price
slumped from Sch980 on issue to a low of Sch715 in mid-January. At Sch830
this week, it is still well below the issue price.

MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed conglomerate in Hong
Kong, have joined forces to make a HKDollars 8.7bn (USDollars 1.1bn) bid for
Miramar Hotel and Investment.
Mr Li's Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific are offering HKDollars 15.50 a share
and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant for Miramar, which owns the Miramar Hotel on
Kowloon and office and retail properties on the peninsula.
Mr Li has taken small minority positions in other deals involving Citic but
this bid for Miramar is the largest transaction in which he has participated
with a mainland-backed company.
It underlines Mr Li's growing ties with mainland Chinese power brokers and
the decision he has made to concentrate on Hong Kong and China ventures.
However, the initial reaction of the Hong Kong stock market was that the
offer was too low. Miramar's share price yesterday closed at HKDollars 16
and analysts are advising investors to bide their time.
They said Miramar represented one of the best opportunities available in
Hong Kong's property market.
Miramar's assets are in prime Kowloon locations and have good redevelopment
potential.
Mr Li and Citic have indicated that they wish to maintain Miramar's listing.

The investor group is led by France's Mutuelle Assistance Artisanale de

However, the proposed reorganisation has since been bogged down by legal

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Salomon to pay Dollars 54.5m to
settle lawsuits
</HEADLINE>

SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that
it had agreed to pay Dollars 54.5m to settle class action lawsuits filed by
the firm's shareholders and debtholders in the wake of the 1991 bond auction
scandal.
The scandal, which nearly destroyed one of Wall Street's most powerful
firms, erupted when Salomon's bond trading desk was discovered to have faked
customer bids for Treasury securities in a number of bond auctions during
1990 and 1991.
The false bids were part of an attempt by Salomon's chief bond trader to
avoid government rules limiting how many bonds securities firms were allowed
to acquire in each auction.
Yesterday's settlement, however, will not involve Salomon paying any new
money, as the Dollars 54.5m will come out of the Dollars 100m fund the firm
set up in May 1992 to compensate victims of its violations. The fund was
established as part of the settlement reached with the government last year.
At the time, Salomon also paid Dollars 190m in fines and forfeitures for its
actions.
Additionally, Salomon said yesterday that it had agreed to pay all legal
fees incurred in the shareholder and debtholders' action, up to a maximum of
Dollars 12.5m. That money will not come out of the Dollars 100m compensation
fund, but will be paid directly by the firm.
Although this latest settlement is an important step for Salomon, it does
not represent the final chapter in the bond auction scandal. The firm still
has to fight litigation brought by investors who purchased government
securities in 1990 and 1991 and who claim they suffered losses.
The firm is expected to fight these actions more vigorously than it did the
lawsuits settled yesterday. Senior Salomon executives knew of the illegal
activities for months before they were publicly revealed, so the firm had
little choice but to reach a settlement.
Also, Mr Paul Mozer, the former head bond trader at Salomon who allegedly
faked the customer bids in Treasury auctions, still faces trial for his
actions.

Final pricing has not been fixed, but the issue is expected to value the

AMS had net income of Sch50.7m on sales of Sch724.6m last year and is not
raising any money for itself from the flotation.
Of the 1.85m shares in the issue, 43 per cent will be offered to
international investors and 57 per cent to private and institutional
investors in Austria.
Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, global co-ordinator of the issue, and
Kleinwort Benson of London, international lead manager, will be hoping to

Last November, 49 per cent of the shares of Voest Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme, a

exceeded its profit forecast and still has excellent prospects, the share
price slumped from Sch980 on issue to a low of Sch715 in mid-January. At
Sch830 this week, it is still well below the issue price.
Brokers say the problem, apart from the general weakness of the Austrian
equity market, was that many Austrian subscribers sold their shares shortly
after receiving them, catching the market managers unawares. This time a
slightly larger portion of the issue has been reserved for international
investors.
Austria is issuing Sch8bn of 6.5 per cent five-year bonds due in 1998 and
priced at 99.85 to give a top yield to tender bidders of 6.8 per cent,
according to lead manager Oesterreichischen Kontrollbank. A total of 50.88
per cent of bids were accepted in the tender and the issue has an average
yield of 6.536 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE 310 securities firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange
earned record after-tax profits of Dollars 1.51bn in the first quarter of
this year.
The total is up sharply from the previous record of Dollars 1.36bn, set in
the first quarter of last year, and provide more evidence that the boom in
Wall Street earnings shows no signs of slowing down.
The firms' total revenues reached a record Dollars 17.75bn, up from Dollars
16.48bn in the same quarter of 1992. Revenues were strong due to several
factors that have sustained the securities industry for the past two years.
They include heavy demand for stocks from individual and institutional
investors; an extremely busy debt and equity underwriting calendar; strong
growth in client assets under management; and a highly favourable domestic
interest rate climate.
The NYSE said members' assets jumped to Dollars 841.9bn, up from Dollars
631.57bn a year earlier.
The bulk of the increase is attributable to a sharp rise in the value of
securities holdings, especially in US government bonds, which have performed
strongly over the past year.
NYSE firms' expenses were a record Dollars 15.45bn in the quarter, a
reflection of the fact that employee compensation is tied to earnings
performance.

accelerator - The government's efforts to get its citizens on the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazil's car market is booming. Despite the country's economic and political
turmoil, the Brazilian car industry is on its way to reclaiming from Mexico
the title of Latin America's leading car producer.
During the first five months of 1993, production rose 33.8 per cent compared
with 1992. Output reached an all-time high of 124,000 vehicles in May,
beating the previous monthly high - October, 1980 - of 121,000. The industry
looks capable of reaching its production goal of 1.2m this year.
The buoyant market is providing a rare bright spot for Fiat, the Italian
carmaker. Fiat do Brasil has been fast mopping up market share, capturing 21
per cent of domestic sales last year, up from 12 per cent in 1989. Having
passed the long-standing number three manufacturer, Ford, Fiat is now
closing in on number two, General Motors do Brasil.
Fiat appears to be carving a substantial niche in lower priced small cars.
Its compact Uno is now the second leading seller, trailing only the Gol
hatchback, Volkswagen's long popular model sold exclusively in Brazil.
This performance is leading to suggestions that Fiat do Brasil could soon
become the sole producer of a new economy model, based on the Uno. The new
model would be exported to Europe.
The company, which shipped Dollars 842m of vehicles last year, was Brazil's
leading private sector exporter. The Fiorino pick-up truck is already
produced exclusively in Brazil.
Some industry analysts nevertheless believe that Fiat's Brazilian push is
related to the loss of market share in Italy and Europe. 'Fiat do Brasil is
not going to be able to maintain its high levels of exports to Italy,'
predicts one analyst. 'It has to depend on Brazil.'
Fiat is meeting the increase in demand without large new investments, said
Mr Pacifico Paoli who runs the car division of Fiat do Brasil. He plans to
increase daily output from 900 vehicles in December 1992 to 1,400 by June
1994.
However, investment in added capacity seems likely only if the main Fiat
board in Turin decides to produce their new economy model there. A new model
can only be manufactured in Brazil if the company is also confident of
domestic demand.
Despite the recent growth in market share in Brazil, Mr Paoli admits that
Fiat do Brasil's chances of substantial parent company investment hinge
largely on developments within the economy, not least a monthly inflation
rate running close to 30 per cent.
Nonetheless Mr Paoli sees better things to come: 'Brazil has to come out of
its 10 year period of stagnation.' Already Brazilians are buying cars like
never before.
The industry got a jump start from February's tripartite accord between
management, labour and government. The government has reduced taxes,
industry has promised to squeeze margins, and the unions will hold wage
demands to 6.3 per cent a year even though shop floor workers earn just
Dollars 2.79 an hour.
Coming on top of last year's pioneering union agreement, the pact means that
for-sale sticker prices are effectively one third lower than they would
otherwise be.
Tax breaks are also helping to underpin demand. The idea is to get more
Brazilians behind the wheel and help revive a sluggish economy. Last year
the economy contracted by 1 per cent.
According to the National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers,
40 jobs are created in other industries by every new car industry job. The
motor industry already accounts for 8 per cent of Brazil's gross domestic
product.
It is the bottom end of the market that appears to be most price sensitive.
'Car ownership in Brazil is even more concentrated than income,' says Mr
Paoli. There is one car for every 11.4 Brazilians, compared to one for every
5.7 Argentines and one for 1.3 Americans.
The most recent decree provides for a reduction of the federal value added
tax from 14 per cent to 0.1 per cent. This is expected to result in
wholesale price reductions of between 10 and 13 per cent for eligible
models. Most of those models have 1,000cc engines.
All Brazil's leading manufacturers - Autolatina (the joint venture between
Volkswagen and Ford), General Motors and Fiat - have models eligible for the
tax break. Small wonder perhaps that production of the Volkswagen Beetle,
which ceased production in 1986, is scheduled to restart in Brazil in
August.
Although it has a 1,600cc engine, the Beetle will benefit from tax
concessions. VW has already begun to predict that original production
figures of 20,000 units a year may have to be increased.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: NY Times in bid to take over
Boston Globe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE New York Times was understood yesterday to have bid around Dollars 1bn
for Affiliated Publications, the parent company of the Boston Globe, in a
takeover that would bring under its management one of the US's best-known
newspapers, and further expand its reach in the north-east of the US.
While a similar bid was turned down in January, and may be rejected again,
some assurances for editorial independence were given this time, making
acceptance more likely, said a former Globe executive familiar with the
situation.
Affiliated Publications has a current stock market value of around Dollars
960m. Neither the New York Times nor the Boston Globe would comment on the
transaction, which has long been rumoured.
The Boston Globe has a daily circulation of more than 500,000, making it New
England's largest newspaper, and the 13th biggest in the US. Last year it
posted revenues of Dollars 409m, and profits of Dollars 30m.
The takeover 'would constitute an important vote of confidence in the
newspaper market,' said Mr Eric Philo, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. He said
the bid looks to value the Boston Globe at around 12 1/2 times cash flow. It
could act as a benchmark for further deals, as the newspaper industry
recovers from its recession and profits rise.
In 1996 two of Affiliated's family trusts expire, making the company
vulnerable to a hostile takeover, possibly to one of the large US newspaper
chains.
'If they want to settle the future of the paper, this is a great deal. I
would just as soon hook up with the New York Times than USA Today,' said the
former Globe executive.
The New York Times is keen to diversify geographically, and reduce its
dependence on New York's sluggish economy. The acquisition would give the
New York Times huge marketing power in the north-east of the US, enable it
to cut costs as it combines distribution with the Globe, and perhaps as
importantly, keep the Boston Globe out of potential rivals' hands.
However, the takeover would further expose the New York Times to the
fortunes of the newspaper industry, and in the short term dilute earnings.
It is expected to pay for Affiliated Publications mostly with its shares.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fed approves Bank of Boston
purchases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BANK of Boston, the largest bank in Massachusetts, has been given approval
by the US Federal Reserve to buy two New England banks, Multibank Financial
and Society for Savings Bancorp.
The Bank of Boston will pay with its own shares an equivalent of around
Dollars 232m for Multibank, and Dollars 215m for Society for Savings. The
two banks would add Dollars 4.8bn to Bank of Boston's existing assets of
Dollars 32bn.
The purchase is still conditional on approval by the Massachusetts Board of
Bank Incorporation, but this is expected to be a formality. Bank of Boston
had to promise to raise around Dollars 170m in new capital to win approval
from the Federal Reserve for the purchase of Multibank.
Two Federal Board governors opposed the authorisation, on the grounds that
the promise to raise new capital was not part of the Bank of Boston's
original application. The two members believed the addition of new
information after the original application 'impairs the integrity of the
Board's decision-making process'.
Mr Ira Stephanian, chairman of Bank of Boston, said 'the merger of these two
institutions into the Bank of Boston organisation will be a major step
forward in our strategy to grow our retail franchises in Massachusetts and
Connecticut.'

FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian banking and insurance group, reported a 14 per
cent rise in first-quarter net profit, bolstered by the first-time
consolidation of a Spanish joint venture and a Dutch savings bank.
Net profit rose to Ecu85.1m (Dollars 103.82m) from Ecu74.5m a year earlier,
on revenues up 15 per cent at Ecu2.54bn. Among the factors behind the rise
were favourable exchange rate movements. If currency factors are excluded,
net profit would have risen by 9 per cent.
The first-time consolidation of the Caifor joint venture with Spain's La
Caixa and of VSB Bank in the Hague lay behind the strong increases in
pre-tax operating results from life insurance, up 25 per cent, and banking,
up 40 per cent.
In other sectors, accident and health insurance posted a more modest rise of
13 per cent, while operating losses widened to Ecu6.1m from Ecu3.9m in other
non-life lines such as motor and fire insurance. Capital gains on
investments such as shares and property fell to Ecu22.2m from Ecu26.6m a
year earlier.
Fortis said the results confirmed previous expectations that full-year net
and operating profit would at least match their 1992 level. It noted that
second-quarter figures would include capital gains from the sale of the
company's shares in Belgium's Generale de Banque.
Ahold, the Dutch-based supermarket and retail group, reported a 13 per cent
increase in net profit to Fl 96.2m (Dollars 53.4m) during the first quarter
of 1993.
Operating results showed an even stronger rise of 23.3 per cent to Fl
180.8m, but this was partially offset by a substantial rise in financial
costs to Fl 49m from Fl 34.4m, reflecting new acquisitions as well as
first-time consolidations.
Sales rose by 22.3 per cent to Fl 8bn as a result of new acquisitions in the
Netherlands and Portugal and the consolidation of Schuitema, a Dutch food
wholesaler which is 73 per cent-owned by Ahold and which was previously not
consolidated. If these factors are eliminated, sales growth totalled 4.9 per
cent.
In the US, where Ahold is one of the 10 largest supermarket operators,
higher operating results were achieved at three of the group's four
supermarket chains - Tops, Bi-Lo and Giant Food Stores. The fourth, First
National, posted lower results. Total US operating profit rose by 7.2 per
cent to Dollars 48.1m.
In the Netherlands, operating results were up 29.7 per cent at Fl 87.6m,
partly due to consolidations and acquisitions.

Nova field

<TEXT>
PETRO-CANADA wants to start developing the Terra Nova oilfield off
Newfoundland without delay once the CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.09bn)
Hibernia project comes on stream in 1997, according to Mr James Stanford,
president.
Petro-Canada, now privatised and the country's second biggest integrated oil
company, owns 44 per cent of Terra Nova, whose recoverable oil reserves are
estimated at 350m barrels.
Development would cost CDollars 2.5bn using a floating production system,
rather than Hibernia's massive concrete production and storage rig modelled
on the North Sea experience.
Both fields are about 200 miles off St John's. Petro-Canada has 25 per cent
of Hibernia with Mobil as an operator.
Construction of the rig is under way in Newfoundland and Hibernia starts up
in 1997 at 25,000 barrels daily, rising to 125,000 barrels daily in 1999.
Petro Canada's partners in Terra Nova include Mobil, Husky Oil, Gulf Canada
and Shell Canada. As operator it is doing preliminary work on a production
plan.
Mr Stanford explained that following up Hibernia with Terra Nova development
would maximise the benefits of the construction workforce in the Maritimes.
Total Canada and partner Husky Oil plan a second CDollars 3m exploration
well on a property near Calgary where a large oil discovery has been
rumoured.
Mr Donald West, Total president, called some of the rumours outrageous, and
said that drilling crews could only return in October.
The first well early this year reached 9,000ft but tests could not be
completed.
Total of France sold its 53 per cent stake in the company earlier this year.
Total Canada has changed its name to Rigel Energy.
Amoco Canada is selling 14 per cent of its Canadian oil and gas properties,
accounting for 8 per cent of total production, in Alberta, British Columbia
and Saskatchewan as part of a restructuring to reduce debt. Among the
probable buyers are Canadian Natural Resources and Penn West Petroleum.
China National Petroleum plans an investment in a Saskatchewan heavy oil
property and may invest in Syncrude, Alberta's biggest oil sands producer,
said Mr Naija Wang, chairman of its Canadian subsidiary.

THE Finnish government has agreed to shoulder 90 per cent of losses arising
from the FM3.4bn (Dollars 630m) portfolio of non-performing loans held by
STS-Bank, resolving an issue outstanding since Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the
country's leading commercial bank, took over STS last November in the wake
of the country's banking crisis. The Government Guarantee Fund, the body
handling the state's bank rescue operation, said yesterday the STS bad
assets would be concentrated in a so-called 'bad bank' named Siltapankki
which KOP will manage.
However, KOP will be responsible only for 10 per cent of any losses incurred
on the loans. In addition, the guarantee fund will for the time being assume
full responsibility for STS loans to Co-operative Eka Corporation and Haka
Oy, two closely linked co-operative industrial groups which have had the
right to take deposits from the public.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Profit surge at Axel Springer
Verlag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AXEL Springer Verlag, the German media group, yesterday reported a surge in
profits for 1992, but warned that recession and intense competition were
taking their toll on turnover in the current year.
Reflecting the impact of a cost-cutting programme and lower newsprint
prices, net profits last year were DM57.2m (Dollars 35.7m), more than five
times the DM11.2m made in 1991. Another factor behind the profits increase
was the sale of loss-making investments, Springer said.
Springer said that the improvement in profitability would allow it to resume
paying dividends. The 1992 dividend is to be DM12 per share, the same level
as for each year from 1986 to 1990 inclusive. In 1991 the group paid no
dividend.
Turnover for last year dropped by DM115.4m, or 3.1 per cent, to DM3.57bn.
Springer blamed the decline on competition in the media sector which had led
to a fall in advertising revenue as well as from newspaper sales.
The group, which publishes the daily mass-circulation Bild newspaper as well
as Die Welt, a more serious daily newspaper, said the trend had continued
into the current business year, with newspaper revenues down by 3.4 per cent
and advertising revenue down by 7.5 per cent in the first four months of the
year.
It said in the light of the recession in Germany there were no signs that
the deterioration would be reversed. However, Springer said it intended to
pursue its rationalisation policies with the hope of reporting a reasonable
profit for the current year.
Capital investment for the current year is set to be DM330m, with the
emphasis on improving the quality of newspapers printed in eastern Germany.
This involves the development of a new offset-printing plant in Spandau in
Berlin. Last year, capital investment amounted to DM245.2m, up from DM198m.

to Fl 395m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES in non-life insurance and reinsurance limited the rise in net profit
at ING Group, the big Dutch banking and insurance company, to 2.3 per cent
in the first quarter of 1993.
Net profit increased to Fl 395m (Dollars 219m) from Fl 386m the year before,
after adjustments to reflect new accountancy principles adopted in early
1993.
If it had not been for these accounting changes, net profit in the first
quarter would have risen by 10.3 per cent, ING said.
The losses in non-life and reinsurance overshadowed a strong increase in
profits in life insurance, with North America in particular posting
substantially higher results. Overall, operating losses at ING's insurance
arm dropped by 10.3 per cent to Fl 243m. However, ING's banking operations
posted a pre-tax operating increase of 16.9 per cent to Fl 298m, helping to
compensate for the downturn in insurance.

<TEXT>
MR Li Ka-shing and Citic Pacific, Beijing's listed conglomerate in Hong
Kong, have joined forces to make a HKDollars 8.7bn (USDollars 1.1bn) bid for
Miramar Hotel and Investment.
Mr Li's Cheung Kong and Citic Pacific are offering HKDollars 15.50 a share
and HKDollars 8.50 a warrant for Miramar, which owns the Miramar Hotel on
Kowloon and office and retail properties on the peninsula.
Mr Li has taken small minority positions in other deals involving Citic but
this bid for Miramar is the largest transaction in which he has participated
with a mainland-backed company.
It underlines Mr Li's growing ties with mainland Chinese power brokers and
the decision he has made to concentrate on Hong Kong and China ventures.
However, the initial reaction of the Hong Kong stock market was that the
offer was too low. Miramar's share price yesterday closed at HKDollars 16
and analysts are advising investors to bide their time.
They said Miramar represented one of the best opportunities available in
Hong Kong's property market.
Miramar's assets are in prime Kowloon locations and have good redevelopment
potential.
Mr Michael Greene, at Warburg Securities, said he expected Mr Li and Citic
immediately to sell the commercial properties on strata title, providing
joint ownership, probably to mainland Chinese companies seeking a hedge
against the devaluation of the yuan.
He said they could also take advantage of under-utilised 'plot ratio' in
some of Miramar's commercial properties to increase the amount of space
available for sale.
The Miramar Hotel, on Nathan road in Kowloon, is a sprawling if somewhat
dowdy hotel. It could either be refurbished or, razed and replaced with a
commercial and retail development.
Mr Li and Citic have indicated that they wish to maintain Miramar's listing.
The reason is unclear, but there is an active secondary market in Hong Kong
listings and analysts expect them to sell it to a mainland Chinese company
seeking a Hong Kong listing.
Miramar, a Hang Seng constituent, is controlled by the Yeung family, which
owns 21 per cent of the company. Its other main shareholder is Goldberg
Corporation SA which owns 13 per cent.

FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: LVMH tries to adjust after a
life of luxury - How the French group is coming to terms with a harsher
environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Bernard Arnault battled his way to the top of LVMH, the world's
largest luxury goods group, it was flourishing in the affluent environment
of the mid-1980s. He now faces the challenge of adapting to the ascetic
climate of the 1990s.
The new battle has already begun. Mr Arnault yesterday told a shareholders'
meeting that his group would suffer a fall in first-half profits this year.
He warned that LVMH - which owns high prestige brand names ranging from
Louis Vuitton luggage, to Hennessy cognac and Christian Dior perfume -
would, at best, muster a slight increase on 1992's net profits of FFr3bn
(Dollars 555m) for the full year.
Mr Arnault said it was 'much more difficult to run a luxury goods group
today than it was 10 years ago'.
LVMH is not the only company to be struggling.
Dunhill, its London-based competitor, last week disclosed a decline in
profits last year. Gucci, an Italian rival, is said to be searching for new
capital.
However, LVMH has underlying strengths. First, it entered the recession
having completed the restructuring that followed its formation in the merger
of a number of family-owned companies in the mid-1980s.
It was, at least, in a stable state when the market declined, unlike Gucci,
which was struggling to reposition its brand.
LVMH has the advantage of a broad base of interests both in terms of
products and international spread.
The strength of some sectors, notably perfume, has helped to counter the
problems of others, such as champagne.
Similarly, it is less exposed to individual markets than rivals such as
Dunhill, which has been badly affected by Japan's instability.
These strengths have sheltered LVMH from the rigours of the recession.
Its operating profits fell to FFr5.5bn in 1992 from FFr6.4bn in 1991.
However, the chief reason for the decline in net income to FFr3bn from
FFr3.7bn was the reduction in the contribution from its 24 per cent holding
in Guinness, the UK drinks group, to FFr681m from FFr1.1bn.
So far, there is no sign of improvement in trading this year, except for the
US.
The luggage division is struggling to maintain operating profits as it did
last year at FFr1.87bn. Cognac, which saw operating profits fall to
FFr2.29bn in 1992 from FFr2.79bn in 1991, seems stable.
'The Japanese market has been affected by the economic situation,' said Mr
Arnault. 'But we have had very strong growth from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
China.'
The chief concern is champagne, which has been trapped in a vicious cycle of
weak demand, rising stocks and high raw material prices.
Operating profits plummeted to FFr780m in 1992 from FFr1.33bn in 1991.
LVMH last month called for 245 job losses at the 1,600-strong
Moet-et-Chandon champagne house. This followed a 10 per cent price cut for
Moet in France and Germany, although the price has been raised in the UK,
Italy and Spain following the ERM crisis.
Mr Arnault said it was too soon to assess the effect of the price changes.
'Champagne has always been a cyclical industry and we are at a low point in
the cycle,' he said. 'But the cycle will change, hopefully from next year.'
Meanwhile, analysts are braced for another plunge in profits this year.
Perfume has been the most robust business with operating profits rising to
FFr809m in 1992 from FFr636m, due to the successful launches of Dior's Dune
and Givenchy's Amarige. Mr Arnault anticipates further growth in 1993.
However, perfume margins, at 15 per cent last year, are far lower than those
of cognac and luggage at 40 per cent. The fragrance market is also riskier
with short product life-cycles and high launch costs.
LVMH's finances are too constricted - with FFr14.5bn net debt and 50 per
cent gearing - for Mr Arnault to buy his way out of recession.
He has made a few small investments, notably last month's purchase of
Financiere Truffaut, which owns minority holdings in the Kenzo fashion house
and Agache, the Arnault master company.
Mr Arnault said he 'could not exclude' buying out some of the Truffaut
minorities. But the days of audacious deals, such as the Pounds 20m (Dollars
30.8m) launch of the loss-making Christian Lacroix fashion house, are over.
'The Lacroix experience has had benefits, we've learnt a lot from it,' he
said. 'But no one would even imagine opening a new couture house today.'
LVMH will have to engineer its recovery through its existing interests.
Mr Sylvain Massot, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is confident that it can.
'So far, it's come through fairly well,' he said. 'Profits will probably be
static in 1993, but we should see growth from 1994 onwards.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 2.98m at Welpac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welpac, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler, reported a pre-tax
deficit of Pounds 2.98m on turnover of Pounds 17.1m in the year to January
31.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 694,000 from sales of Pounds 9.72m for
1992, restated to comply with FRS 3.
Mr Gerald Lavender, chairman, said the 76 per cent increase in turnover
reflected the acquisition of Anderson &amp; Firmin and TJ Harwood. The profits
fall was the result of one-off exceptional costs and weak demand.
Losses per share increased to 11.2p (4.1p). There is no dividend (last year
a single final dividend of 0.2p was paid).

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dares Estates cuts losses to Pounds 22.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dares Estates, the property investment and development group, is continuing
talks with its UK lenders and the board hopes that it is near agreement.
The proposals involve the conversion of Pounds 9.7m into preference shares,
some of which will be convertible into ordinary shares, subordination of
Pounds 9m debt and the extension of the maturity of residual debt until
December 31 1997.
Other provisions cover permission to pay interest by the issue of preference
shares and the conversion of existing preference shares into ordinary
shares.
For the 1992 year, which saw pre-tax losses cut from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds
22.3m, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, subject to
the capital reorganisation being agreed.
The fall was helped by lower interest costs and exceptional charges.
Exceptionals came to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 17.8m) of which Pounds 11.4m
related to provisions for the fall in value of assets. Interest costs were
Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 12.2m).
Turnover was Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 17.4m) made up of rental income of Pounds
5.44m (Pounds 7.6m) and other income down from Pounds 9.78m to Pounds
90,000. Losses per share were 13.53p (15.76p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES CROPPER, the Cumbria-based paper and board manufacturer,lifted annual
profits by 18 per cent as a strong performance from its converting division
offset a poor year in papermaking in the UK.
On turnover little changed at Pounds 40.3m, pre-tax profits for the 12
months to March 27, struck after an exceptional reorganisation charge of
Pounds 174,000, amounted to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.06m).
The technical fibre products side experienced a turn-round into the black
and the weak domestic papermaking operation was mitigated by growth in
export sales and profits.
A recommended final of 2.125p brings the total for the year to 3.1p (3p),
covered three times by earnings of 9.4p (8.6p) per share.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Staveley rises 9% despite fall in margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAVELEY, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which also owns
British Salt, reported a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year
but a deterioration in trading and operating margins.
The mechanical and electrical services division suffered from depressed
conditions in the construction industry. But measurement, which makes
weighing machinery, and minerals, which produces more than half the UK's
salt, both increased profits.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22.4m to Pounds 24.4m on sales up 15.6 per
cent at Pounds 344.9m. Underlying organic sales growth was 10 per cent - the
balance arising from an acquisition and the effect of translating foreign
currency sales.
Earnings per share rose from 15.1p to 16.1p and the group is to pay a final
dividend of 6.2p, giving 8.5p in total, up 3.7 per cent.
Measurement produced operating profits of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.1m) from
sales of Pounds 153m. Mr Brian Kent, chairman, said margins should be double
this year. Growth in this division would come from the introduction of new
products.
Profits from mechanical and electrical services fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds
5.6m) on sales up 18 per cent at Pounds 152.9m. Mr Kent said the fall in the
construction industry had bottomed out and there was recovery potential from
a stronger order book.
Minerals produced operating profits of Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 11.8m) on sales
of Pounds 32.9m despite price controls.
Gearing rose from 11 per cent to 22 per cent with net debt up from Pounds
11m to Pounds 20m, partly as a result of translating dollar denominated debt
after sterling left the ERM. Capital expenditure was lifted by a Pounds 4m
investment in plant to help expand sales of salt products.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost reductions point way foward for
Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER Leverton, who joined Pilkington as chief executive last summer,
said there were some positive signs within the glass group's annual results
despite the fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.7m - restated from Pounds
77m to comply with FRS 3 - to Pounds 40.7m and the reduced dividend.
He said that for the first time cost reductions had more than offset
inflation. During the year costs of Pounds 70m had been taken out while
inflation had increased costs by Pounds 66m. Over the last three years
annual costs of Pounds 170m had been cut, largely through job reductions.
Cash flow excluding disposals, but before dividends, was positive in the
second half of the year for the first time since 1990, he said.
Capital expenditure had been reduced to Pounds 128m in the year, below the
depreciation charge for the first time since the mid-1980s. Mr Leverton said
it would stay at about the Pounds 125m level for the next couple of years.
Working capital had also been cut, by Pounds 30m in the year and by Pounds
250m since 1990.
However, trading results from each of the group's divisions were lower,
except for the rest of the world group which includes Argentina, Brazil and
Australasia.
Operating profits from continuing businesses in European glass fell 29 per
cent to Pounds 37.5m, while North American profits dropped 68 per cent to
Pounds 3.5m. In both areas excess glass-making capacity had put pressure on
prices. The rest of the world increased profits 80 per cent to Pounds 39m
with Argentina making a record profit and the Australian business benefiting
from cost cutting.
Visioncare, the spectacle and contact lens business, saw profits down from
Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 18.8m, although within that the Sola spectacle side,
which is soon to be sold, increased profits; contact lens profits fell from
Pounds 5m to Pounds 2m.
Gearing at the year end was 78 per cent with net debt, including finance
leases, of Pounds 932m (Pounds 760m). The Heywood Williams acquisition would
take gearing to about 88 per cent, Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said.
However, the sale of Sola was expected to be agreed soon, he said, and would
be for a 'good premium over book value of Pounds 120m'. That would 'make a
substantial dent in gearing'. More disposals over the next two years would
bring gearing down further.
Pilkington is expected to reduce its stake in the Australian operations to
50 per cent and is likely to sell its contact lens business once profits
there recover.

FT  11 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Rights issues retain appeal - Why the
equity market shows no signs of indigestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property rights-issue bandwagon seems unstoppable. When Great Portland
Estates issued a Pounds 95m rights issue this week, it pushed the total
amount of property funds raised in the equity market to over Pounds 900m.
Analysts believe that a continuing stream of issues, which may increasingly
come from smaller companies, will take the total raised to well over Pounds
1bn.
So far, the equity market shows no sign of indigestion: share prices have
gone up when companies have asked investors for money.
At first sight, investors' enthusiasm appears remarkable. Why are they
prepared to hand over large sums of money, with few strings attached, to
managements which rarely have strong track records, with little prospect of
dividend increases for many years? Indeed, in the case of Great Portland the
rights issue was accompanied by a promise of a dividend cut for 1994.
The explanation is two-fold. First, the huge increase in property share
prices over the past nine months means that many property shares are no
longer trading at a discount to assets, which over the long term has
averaged more than 25 per cent.
The erosion of this discount means that companies can issue shares without
diluting their assets. 'Historically speaking, there have been very few
opportunities for companies to issue equity at around the asset value and
some may not wish to miss the current window of opportunity,' says James
Capel, a broker.
Second, many investors believe that asset values are set to rise. Rather
than force cash-strapped companies to sell properties to reduce their
borrowings, fund managers would prefer to give companies the cash to go
bargain-hunting.
By converting corporate sellers to buyers, the injection of new equity into
the corporate sector is having a large impact on the property market. It may
have another knock-on effect; by transforming companies' ability to issue
bonds.
Mr Hugh Corbett, of UBS, the broker, believes that the current spate of
rights issues is paying the way for a wave of bond issues. He expects Pounds
500m-Pounds 1bn of debentures and long-dated bonds to be issued in coming
months. 'It is like the equity market, the opportunity is there,' he says.
'They (the property companies) will grab it when they can.'
He argues that there is a strong market for property bonds. 'By historic
standards, there is a lot of demand for good quality, long-dated bonds from
institutions,' he says. The injections of new funds into the property
sector, which have repaired companies' balance sheets, together with the
brighter prospects for asset values, have removed the main constraint on
issuing bonds.
The main arguments cited by UBS in favour of issuing debentures now are:
The relationship between the yields available from property and long gilt
yields has never been closer. 'As a result, it is now theoretically possible
to raise long-dated debenture finance at a rate cheaper than the average
yield from property,' according to UBS.
Companies which delay may not be able to invest at such attractive yields or
borrow as cheaply. UBS expects property investment yields to fall by about
0.5 per cent a year for the next three years, while 25-year gilt yields rise
to 8.7 per cent by the end of 1993 and 9.3 per cent the year after.
Conversely, the factors discouraging companies from issuing debentures are:
The steep slope of the sterling yield curve means it is currently cheaper to
borrow short term rather than long term.
Concern about gearing levels and the possibility that asset values still
have further to fall.
There may be difficulties in issuing unsecured property debt. Downgrades
from the credit rating agencies have limited the pool of potential investors
in short-dated issues.
Looking ahead, there may be other obstacles facing the debenture market.
Investors in debentures are attracted by the security of property income,
which is underpinned by the 25 year property lease, with its upwards-only
rent reviews.
Investors are getting nervous about the erosion of the UK institutional
lease and forthcoming changes to privity of contract, the law which holds an
original tenant responsible for paying rent if a subsequent tenant defaults
in the course of the lease.
They are concerned that the government plans to change privity of contract
in a way that will reduce the tenant's obligations and reduce the security
of income associated with a property.
'Any change in this area will seriously prejudice such sources of finance,'
according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd Gilts. 'It would not be going too far to
state that the very existence of the long-term debenture market arises out
of the combination of long lease structures and the insurance and comfort
engendered by privity of contract.'
The uncertain future of the property debenture market gives limited
encouragement to banks concerned about the excessive level of debt
outstanding to the property industry.
Debentures and bonds were promoted as one of the options for refinancing the
property industry by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of
England, when he addressed the Association of Property Bankers last week.
Mr Kent's comments about 'the dearth of obvious solutions for future
financing' underlined the scale of the problem facing the property industry.
The Pounds 37bn debt of the property industry is more than three times, in
real terms, its level in 1974.
'Neither will recovery be boosted by a surge in inflation as it was in the
1970s; nor probably by large-scale investment by institutional investors,
whose enthusiasm for property has waned significantly,' he added.
The problem for many lenders to the property industry is that the recent
revival in interest from investors is focused on a relatively narrow band of
property, with financially-secure tenants on lengthly, secure leases.
But much of the debt overhanging the property industry relates to empty
buildings or those with unreliable tenants, which at present cannot find
investors in any shape or form. Ultimately, a broadly-based recovery in the
property market will depend on the recovery in the economy as a whole.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Protean rides recession with Pounds 4.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, announced
doubled profits of Pounds 4.1m for the 12 months to March 31.
The dividend for the year is increased by 31 per cent to 3.6p via a final of
2.7p; the share price added 8p to 168p.
Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said the results were achieved against the
background of the UK recession and intense competition in most markets.
The contribution from the Carbolite companies and Aquadem, acquired towards
the end of the previous year, helped sales rise 48 per cent to Pounds 33.6m
(Pounds 22.7m).
Turnover outside of the UK and the Irish Republic accounted for 43 per cent
of the total.
Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 10.6p (8.29p).
Mr Ryan said that during the year DA Baldwin and Epsom Glass were acquired
and further opportunities would be sought.
The current year had started with healthy order books.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water buoyed by price rises -
14% advance despite unregulated business losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the 10 privatised water companies,
yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in profits helped by price
increases and acquisitions.
But the company's unregulated business, seen as an important long-term
profit source, suffered losses after interest costs and Mr David Cranston,
chief executive, said the division's performance was 'disappointing'.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 61.1m to Pounds 69.4m, including
Pounds 9.3m from an investment in a hedged equity fund. At the interim
stage, profits were 25 per cent higher at Pounds 39.2m.
Turnover increased 24 per cent to Pounds 252.1m, of which Pounds 13.2m came
from acquisitions after average price rises of 10.3 per cent.
Operating costs increased 23 per cent, leaving operating profits on
continuing operations 22 per cent higher at Pounds 67.2m.
Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 122.9m to Pounds 135.4m while the
company moved from net cash of Pounds 6.1m a year ago to net borrowings of
Pounds 102.8m. Included in the cash outflow were Pounds 24.6m of acquisition
costs and Pounds 55.7m of investments in finance leases.
Non-regulated businesses, which include waste management and environmental
services, increased turnover by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 45.2m.
Earnings increased 18 per cent to 100.7p per share.
A recommended final dividend of 15p makes a total of 22.5p, an increase of
10 per cent.
The shares fell 7p to 563p.

Poor results from Northumbrian's unregulated business were not surprising,
nor unique in the water sector; but the company has been touted in the past
as small enough to generate meaningful non-core profits. Losses after
interest costs last year, with more expected this year, should therefore be
seen as quite a setback, if only temporary. More immediately, with water
companies facing Ofwat's periodic review, Northumbrian has a better immunity
to regulatory challenge than some of its competitors, although its assumed K
factor of 7.2 per cent looks optimistic. This year's profits should be
helped by income from a financial engineering investment and are forecast at
Pounds 78m, putting the shares on a multiple of 5. With the whole sector out
of favour, the shares are unlikely to gain much ground.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs lift Eldridge Pope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED cost-cutting and a reduced interest burden helped Eldridge Pope,
the Dorset-based brewer and wine shipper, lift interim profits to Pounds
203,000.
Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said: 'There is no room for complacency but
progress in recovery is being maintained.'
The shares, quoted on the USM, rose 8p to 101p.
The outcome for the half year to March 31 was struck after interest charges
reduced to Pounds 917,000 (Pounds 1.17m) and compared with a loss last time
of Pounds 84,000, restated for FRS 3. Turnover improved to Pounds 20.5m
(Pounds 20.2m).
Mr Pope said that sales of cask ales and food had been strong but spending
elsewhere, particularly on amusement machines, was 'restrained'. Losses from
the group's share of the Highcliffe Hotel in Bournemouth were reduced from
Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 156,000.
An encouraging start to the second half saw profits in April marginally
ahead of budget; costs remained under tight control, Mr Pope said.
The interim dividend is 1.4p (1.31p), uncovered by earnings of 0.86p (0.4p
restated losses).

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments advances 24% to Pounds
10.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXFORD INSTRUMENTS, the advanced instrumentation group, yesterday reported a
24 per cent increase in full year profits and another strong performance
from its MRI scanner joint venture with Siemens.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 28 increased to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds
8.56m), on turnover down 2 per cent to Pounds 101.1m (Pounds 103.3m).
Interest income expanded from Pounds 357,000 to Pounds 1.1m.
Earnings per share increased more modestly to 15p (14.7p), reflecting a
return to 'more normal' tax rates following the release of provisions last
year. A proposed final dividend of 3.1p, makes a total for the year of 4.5p
(4.3p).
Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, highlighted the 'excellent
performance' of Oxford Magnet Technology, the MRI scanner joint venture with
Siemens.
OMT, which is 49 per cent owned by Oxford, contributed Pounds 6.05m (Pounds
5.1m) to group profits.
Operating profits from the group's core businesses improved by 11.8 per cent
to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 3.1m).
The group spent Pounds 7m on research and development last year and several
important new products were released.
Net cash at the year end stood at some Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 2.4m.
Meanwhile the company is building a second synchrotron - a device that
enables semiconductor manufacturers to pack more circuits onto microchips
than with conventional systems. Mr Williams said the company was confident
of selling the machine, which has a price tag of about Dollars 25m (Pounds
16m).
COMMENT
The results from Oxford were better than the market expected and helped lift
the share price by 14p to 261p. Although operating margins are still too
thin, the group seems to be heading in the right direction once more
following two years of profits decline. With 85 per cent of business coming
from outside the UK, the group should benefit from sterling's depreciation.
Nevertheless there are uncertainties, including concerns about the body
scanner market in the US, where health costs are under the microscope, and
Oxford's expensive 'gamble' on the Synchrotron. These make profit forecasts
hazardous, but with the shares trading on a prospective p/e of about 15 they
may still be worth a flutter.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 600 Group hit by competition on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 600 Group reported a Pounds 1.26m operating loss for the year ended
March 31, due to a further reduction in UK and European orders and 'severely
increased' price competition in several key market areas.
The manufacturer and distributor of machine tools and mechanical handling
equipment said the deficit compared with a loss of Pounds 7.78m, restated to
conform with FRS 3.
Turnover increased from Pounds 98.5m to Pounds 99.2m, although Pounds 4m was
due to exchange rate movements. After lower interest costs of Pounds 1.3m
(Pounds 2.1m), the pre-tax loss was Pounds 2.39m, compared with a restated
Pounds 2.46m.
The final dividend is reduced from 1.5p to 1p, making a total for the year
of 2p (2.5p). Losses per share fell from 6.8p to 5.9p.
Explaining the pay-out cut, Prof Michael Wright, chairman, said: 'Although
the group is in a sound financial position and we believe that we have
encouraging prospects for the future, market conditions have continued to
deteriorate.'
Amid persistent recession in main markets, the reduced operating loss
reflected the group's policy of reducing overheads and rationalising
manufacturing capacity.
Prof Wright said a key objective was to ensure the group had the market
position and financial resources to enable it to trade profitably through
any future demand fluctuations or economic disturbances.
'This is being achieved by continued and detailed attention to cash flow,
with the aim of substantially reducing borrowing.'
In 1992-93 the group suffered a Pounds 3m non-recurring cash outflow on
restructuring its lathe business, and a Pounds 2m VAT payment relating to
the previous year's Pounds 9.3m sale of the surplus Colchester Lathe site.
In spite of this, net borrowings increased by only Pounds 2m to Pounds 9m,
indicating the success of controls on working capital.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Freed to seek the rights for recovery - Why
Wimpey is making its first large share issue since 1963
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, having been released from the shackles imposed by its late
founder Sir Godfrey Mitchell, has moved swiftly to raise the funds it
urgently requires if it is to continue its recuperation.
The former west London stone mason which grew to dominate the UK
construction industry in the 1950s and 1960s before falling on harder times,
will use the cash to buy housing land and re-equip its UK and US quarrying
businesses.
It is the largest but not the first housebuilder to make a cash call on
shareholders this spring on the grounds that the housing market is at last
recovering. Share issues have recently been announced by Berkeley Group and
Bellway, among others.
Two years ago there was an even bigger spurt of rights issues as companies
took advantage of the short-lived euphoria which followed the end of the
Gulf war. Much of this money was used to repair badly damaged balance sheets
rather than the expansion which was promised shareholders.
Wimpey has previously been discouraged from issuing shares by the existence
of Grove Charity Management, established by Sir Godfrey in 1955, and which
until March this year owned 34 per cent of Wimpey making it the company's
largest shareholder.
Grove's charitable obligations would have made it very difficult for it to
support a rights issue, particularly in a business which last year incurred
a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss and cut dividend payments to shareholders to
5.25p compared with 10.5p in 1991.
The trust's sale 11 weeks ago of a 29 per cent stake raised more than Pounds
110m and freed the company to make its first large share issue since it was
floated in 1963.
Only four times in the past 15 years has Wimpey exceeded the Pounds 57.2m
pre-tax profit made in 1978. Last year's loss, after an exceptional
provision of Pounds 113.8m, was the worst in the company's 110-year history.
These figures, however, belie the improvement which has been made in the
company's financial position. Net debt as a proportion of shareholders'
funds has fallen from almost 60 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent at the end
of last year - the lowest level of gearing for a decade.
The reduction in debt has been achieved largely through the disposal of
commercial property and 'peripheral' businesses which have raised more than
Pounds 300m since Mr Joe Dwyer was promoted to chief executive in 1991.
The decision by Sir Clifford Chetwood, who previously combined the role of
chairman and chief executive, to stand down permitted Mr Dwyer to take
decisions which might have been more difficult for a long-standing chief
executive faced with unwinding previous business decisions and personal
loyalties to staff and colleagues.
The early decision to dispose of satellite businesses such as offshore
engineering and waste disposal meant that the company was able to achieve
better prices than if it had waited a further 18 months, by which time some
of these industries were also flagging.
Tarmac has still to announce the sale of its waste disposal operations 20
months after Wimpey sold its waste business for Pounds 105m.
Wimpey, having refocused around the three core activities of housebuilding,
construction and minerals, has now reached the point when it needs to raise
more cash if it is to take advantage of a recovery in UK housebuilding.
Investment in new plant and equipment for UK and US quarries, delayed for at
least two years while the balance sheet was repaired, also cannot be
postponed much longer.
Further sales of UK commercial property investments and housing land in the
US would help pay for this but are unlikely says Wimpey because of 'the
continued depressed conditions in these markets.'
Dwyer says that Wimpey will be disappointed if it does not sell a minimum of
7,000 homes in the UK this year, compared with 5,600 in 1992. The company
needs to increase its land holdings from 14,850 plots with planning
permission to more than 20,000 plots if sales are to rise to 9,000 a year by
the mid 1990s.
Proceeds from the rights issue will also be used to expand and modernise the
group's quarrying operations in the US and UK. Mr Dwyer says demand for
aggregates has shown signs of improving in eastern US while prices have
begun to firm in the UK.
'The work we have done over the past two years means that we are excellently
placed to take advantage of a recovery which I believe is underway.
'Land prices have bottomed and in one or two instances have started to rise.
By next year we expect prices to be generally higher. Purchasing land now
will enable the group to achieve attractive margins on sales next year and
1995,' said Mr Dwyer.
His success may be judged more on how wisely he spends the proceeds from the
company's first rights rather than on the success in reducing the company's
borrowings. 'The job is only half done,' was the verdict from analysts
yesterday as Wimpey shares slipped 3p to 184p.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Scapa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped Scapa Group, which supplies industrial textiles and
services to the paper industry, increase annual pre-tax profits by 5 per
cent from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 47m.
The Blackburn-based group, which makes 66 per cent of its sales outside the
UK, yesterday also announced a management succession and an enhanced scrip
dividend scheme.
Mr Bill Goodall will step down in October after seven years as chairman, on
reaching the group retirement age of 62.
He will be succeeded as executive chairman by Mr Harry Tuley, 59, the
present chief executive.
Mr David Dunn who has been finance director since 1987, will become group
managing director, and a new finance director will be announced shortly.
Turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 347m (Pounds 300m) in the year to
March 31. Sterling's devaluation boosted the sales figure by Pounds 5m and
profits by Pounds 500,000.
Scapa said trading conditions remained difficult for its industrial
customers, but the group had managed to increase market share - particularly
in engineered fabrics.
In engineered rolls, servicing and repair activities had grown at a time
when the absence of new paper machines had reduced business available from
machine builders.
The industrial materials division had shown strong progress, with the start
of recovery in the filter fabric business and a good performance from
industrial textiles and wirecloth for filter screening and industrial
applications.
The companies providing technical adhesive tapes had grown substantially,
both organically in the UK and by acquisition in Europe.
Mr Goodall said: 'The strength of progress now being made endorses further
the board's view that the industrial materials division has the capability
to play a much weightier part of Scapa's future development.'
Earnings rose to 13.8p (13.2p). A final dividend of 4.03p raises the total
to 5.63p (5.36p). However, shareholders can elect to take scrip to the value
of 6.045p, an increase of 50 per cent over the final cash dividend.
For shareholders who want cash, BZW will buy the enhanced scrip at a minimum
of 98 per cent of its value, equivalent to 5.924p. The retained cash and
related advance corporation tax saving of up to Pounds 11.8m would be used
to exploit profitable growth opportunities.
Mr Goodall said: 'With any improvements in underlying economic conditions we
can expect the group to do well and make faster progress.'
COMMENT
These were a solid set of results to mark Mr Goodall's departure, and the
management succession looks well-planned. Scapa is continuing to find it
hard going in the paper industry, but by increasing market share has
positioned itself well for any upturn. More interesting is the management's
confidence that its investment in filtration and other industrial materials
businesses is finally coming good, and offers scope for further
acquisitions. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m would put the shares,
up 2p at 225p, on a prospective multiple of 14.5. That does not seem
expensive for a group which last year earned 78 per cent of its profits from
the UK and US.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Park Food achieves 33% growth to Pounds
10.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARK FOOD Group, which specialises in supplying Christmas hampers via a
network of 70,000 commission-paid agents into about 1m homes, produced
cheery results for the year to March 31.
Pre-tax profits rose 33 per cent to Pounds 10.3m, against Pounds 7.7m, on
turnover down 3 per cent at Pounds 116.1m (Pounds 119.5m). Earnings per
share were 13.29p (10.21p) and a proposed final dividend of 4p makes a total
of 6p (3.2p).
The seasonal nature of the group's primary business allows it to estimate
early its likely performance for the year. On the basis of customer orders
already received for Christmas 1993, Park said yesterday it expects results
to show similar levels of growth to those of 1992.
Then the average customer spend increased by 10.5 per cent. This year the
typical spend is 11.2 per cent over that of 1992. The group has some 40 per
cent of the total UK Christmas hamper market, which is worth an estimated
Pounds 300m.
Two subsidiaries - Jetlag, supplying travellers' kits to airlines and
hotels, and Bee Cee Foods, the group buying arm - continued to contribute to
overall profitability.
Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, said that the group was interested in both
organic and acquisition growth. He added that while Park Food had not been
approached by potential buyers, 'we are, no doubt, ourselves a juicy
morsel'.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Difficult markets leave Watson &amp; Philip
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULT markets in retail services and cash and carry pushed interim
pre-tax profits at Watson &amp; Philip, the food wholesaler and retailer, down
from Pounds 4.14m to Pounds 4.01m after interest costs of Pounds 306,000,
against income of Pounds 28,000.
Turnover in the 26 weeks to April 30, helped by 10 weeks contribution from
Circle K, the Pounds 21m convenience store chain acquisition, improved to
Pounds 265.1m, against Pounds 240.4m in the 27 weeks to May 1 1992.
Trading profits were Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 4.31m) helped by Pounds 684,000
from Circle K and increases in the Foodservice side.
Mr Ian MacPherson, chairman, said retail services and sales to shops the
company did not own, continued to decline, particularly in the southern half
of England. 'This confirms our belief that the strategy of expanding our
wholly owned network is essential.'
He said the main reason for the fall in cash and carry profits was 'a
substantial decline in trading margins from 1.69 per cent to 1.11 per cent',
because of increased competition in a 'static to declining market'.
The interest charge this time reflected the acquisition and increased
working capital at Foodservice. Period end debt of Pounds 13m gave gearing
of about 25 per cent.
The board declared a 4.4p (4.2p) interim dividend although earnings declined
to 8.1p (8.2p).

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro advances 19% - Sales to
England and Wales up 16% and represent 20% of turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in sales to England and Wales and higher than average rainfall
helped Scottish Hydro-Electric, the electricity generator and distributor,
increase pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 by 19 per cent to Pounds
146.4m.
The shares, however, closed 2p lower at 344p.
The dividend rise of 12 per cent to 11.38p was at the higher end of
expectations. It was achieved on earnings per share of 27.6p (25.3p).
Turnover was 7 per cent up at Pounds 717.8m.
Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said the margins improvement had been
helped by lower fuel costs resulting from a change in the fuel mix. The
contribution of gas was 27 per cent, compared with nil in 1991-92 while
hydro increased from 25 to 26 per cent and coal fell from 14 to 9 per cent.
Operating profit was 18 per cent up at Pounds 112m.
Mr Young said the company was examining whether to negotiate new five-year
contracts with British Coal to replace existing ones with two years to run.
Although new contracts would offer lower prices, comparable with those
recently concluded by the generators in England and Wales, one option for
the company was to import all coal when current contracts expire.
'We only burn about 1m tonnes of coal a year and can take a risk with
imported coal as long as we keep reasonable stocks,' he said.
Unlike most electricity companies, Hydro-Electric has kept staff numbers
steady since privatisation two years ago but operating profit per member of
staff has risen from Pounds 35,000 to more than Pounds 50,000 a year.
'We are showing we do not have to cut staff to increase profits,' said Mr
Young.
Sales in England and Wales were up 15.7 per cent to Pounds 135.1m, a fifth
of turnover. Sales volumes in Scotland rose 2.3 per cent.
COMMENT
The modest 9 per cent earnings per share rise may explain why yesterday's
otherwise impressive results failed to lift the share price. Dividend cover,
at 2.43 times, is, after all, low by electricity company standards. However,
Hydro is capable of increasing earnings by more than most in the sector and
the quality looks good. Last year's superficially unimpressive earnings
growth was depressed by the redemption of government debt; the underlying
improvement was 21 per cent. In future the company will benefit from the
sale of its relatively cheap electricity through the enlarged interconnector
with England and Wales. That will increase further the proportion of profits
from non-regulated generation, up last year by 18 per cent before cross
subsidy. Assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 170m this year, the dividend can
increase to 12.7p, putting the shares on a prospective yield of 4.6 per cent
and worth considering.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cluff Resources gold loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLUFF RESOURCES, the mining and minerals group, is negotiating a 20,000
ounce gold loan to finance mining development in Zimbabwe.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the company would
borrow the gold from a bullion house at an interest rate of between 5 and 6
per cent, repayable over three years.
The loan would eliminate costly Zimbabwe bank loans and permit development
of the Freda Rebecca mine where underground production is expected to be
5,000 ounces this year.
Cluff is also buying a 70 per cent interest in Aberfoyle Holdings, a private
company with operations and assets in Zimbabwe, for about Pounds 800,000.
The acquisition is being financed partly by the sale of Pounds 670,000 worth
of shares in Cluff Resources Pacific, an Australian associate.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: New format stores for BHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the retail group made up of the BHS, Mothercare and Blazer
chains, is converting some underperforming BHS stores into a discount
clothing and home goods format, and may open new outlets if the format is
successful.
The move will intensify speculation in the retail trade that the 1990s will
see a rapid growth in lower-price, lower-margin retailing in the UK.
Storehouse said that while searching for a way to revive some
poorly-performing BHS stores it had concluded there was 'undoubtedly an
opportunity' in the discount sector 'if you get it right'.
Fifteen BHS stores, mainly in London and the south-east, will be converted
to the new format, called One Up, in August and September. Their product
range will include women's wear, men's and children's wear and home goods,
at prices averaging about one third less than in BHS.
Mr Simon Hughes, main board director responsible for One Up, said that as
BHS increasingly targeted ABC1 customers, some smaller stores in areas with
a different demographic profile had been struggling. The choice was to
close, sell, or find a way of continuing to trade from the stores.
'We carried out a strategic review of the situation, and identified a gap in
the market,' he said.
As it was converting existing stores, launch costs of the new chain would be
less than Pounds 1m.
BHS introduced One Up products in several stores last year and said they had
sold 'extraordinarily well'. If the converted stores are successful,
Storehouse may open new One Up outlets.
Storehouse would not say what margins it expected to operate off, but they
would be 'lower than in BHS'.
'It won't be cheap and nasty,' Storehouse insisted. 'It will look like a
good, smart store. But it will be bright, fun and zippy. I think the colours
will be quite vigorous.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen at top end of expectations with
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and
crushing equipment, yesterday reported profits at the top end of market
expectations and said the current year had started well.
Pre-tax profits increased by 35 per cent from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 25.3m
in the year to March 31. The increase included a Pounds 3.33m exceptional
profit on the sale of Guzzler, a US maker of vacuum cleaning equipment.
The results were compiled under the FRS 3 accounting standard.
Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said these were 'an excellent set of
results' in the face of recession in the UK and a slowdown in Europe.
There was concern about the German economy, but Italy was growing and the
Netherlands was recovering. 'We will continue to grow in Europe, just not as
fast,' he said.
Turnover rose 32 per cent to Pounds 95.4m (Pounds 72.4m), including Pounds
4.37m of sales from acquisitions. These included CPV in the Republic of
Ireland, which suffered from currency uncertainties and incurred a small
loss.
Sales to the Far East grew strongly and now account for nearly 10 per cent
of turnover. Continental European sales increased by 2 percentage points to
30 per cent. Matbro, a maker of telescopic fork-lift vehicles acquired in
1991, more than doubled sales to Pounds 15.2m.
Interest charges were Pounds 717,000 (Pounds 340,000). The sale of Guzzler
lifted net cash at the year end to Pounds 17m.
Earnings per share came through at 20.7p (16.3p).
The recommended final dividend of 4.8p makes a total of 6.6p, up 10 per
cent.
COMMENT
These results easily pleased Powerscreen's growing band of supporters in the
City, which marked the shares up 17p to 337p. The company has scarcely put a
foot wrong in the last six years of rising profits, and analysts pointed to
Matbro's latest results as indicative that Powerscreen's manufacturing and
marketing techniques can still be propegated in new niches. This year, all
companies in the group are projecting profits increases and the Far East is
likely to pick up any slack from continental Europe. But with full year
group profit forecasts of Pounds 26m putting the shares on 15 times, all
this good news appears to be in the price.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks sails into Pounds 14m ship
owning joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEY DOCKS and Harbour is buying 50 per cent of Merchant Ferries, a roll
on-roll off freight ferry operator on Irish Sea routes, in a Pounds 14m
deal. It is the company's first venture into ship owning.
Merchant Ferries, formerly wholly owned by Cenargo International, a private
company, has three ships operating on the Irish Sea between Warrenpoint in
Northern Ireland and the two Lancashire ports of Fleetwood and Heysham.
Two bigger ships will shortly replace the pair on the Heysham route, which
then will be chartered out pending redeployment on another Merchant Ferries
route.
The deal involves Pounds 4.8m cash and a guarantee of Cenargo obligations up
to a maximum Pounds 9.1m. Merchant Ferries had net assets of Pounds 1.33m,
excluding ship owning - then part of another company - at its last year-end,
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 470,000.
Mersey Docks already operates a lift on - lift off service between Liverpool
and Ireland through Coastal Containers, a subsidiary which charters its
ships.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: HTV chief accuses rivals of 'imperialist
ambition'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LOUIS Sherwood, chairman of HTV, yesterday accused Carlton Communications
and Central Independent Television of 'imperialist ambition' over
independent television, writes Raymond Snoddy.
The two companies, Mr Sherwood said, had been lobbying the government to
relax the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies - which includes
HTV - taking each other over.
'As a citizen I absolutely believe in the regional identity of ITV. It's
important,' said Mr Sherwood, who will join other ITV chairmen at a meeting
on Monday with Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, to discuss
the issue of ownership.
He was speaking after the annual meeting at which he criticised as 'wildly
exaggerated ' a Carlton claim that Pounds 100m a year could be saved from
non-programme costs if there was to be a consolidation of ITV companies.
This, he said, would mean that if Carlton took over HTV there would have to
be combined overhead savings of about Pounds 20m a year based on aggregate
advertising revenue.
HTV said it is demonstrating that economies of scale can be created in ITV,
but by working partnerships between companies.
HTV is expected to join Meridian and Anglia in opposing at the National
Heritage meeting piecemeal changes in ownership rules.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chubb secures 64% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHUBB Security, which demerged from Racal Electronics last year, reported a
64 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 64.2m, helped by a sharp
improvement in operating margins.
Sales were almost flat at Pounds 674.4m (against Pounds 668.9m) despite
rising crime rates, which the company says expands its market.
Chubb's preliminary results complete a week in which Sir Ernest Harrison has
been able to report strong performances from the three companies where he is
chairman - Chubb, Racal Electronics and Vodafone.
The fruits of a cost-saving exercise, were behind the improvement at Chubb,
as promised when it demerged from Racal in response to a hostile bid from
Williams Holdings.
Earnings per share, before extraordinary items, rose from 6.93p to 13.28p
and the group is to pay a final dividend of 3.25p, making a total of 4.75p.
Had the group reported under the FRS 3 accounting standard, earnings per
share would have risen from 1.97p to 12.47p, reflecting high closure costs,
provisions and goodwill write-offs in the year to March 1992.
Cash flow was strong, reducing net debt from Pounds 60m to Pounds 4.8m,
helped by Pounds 15m stripped out of working capital.
At the trading level electronic security produced profits of Pounds 39.2m
from sales of Pounds 337.3m. Physical security, which includes the original
safes and locks business, made Pounds 36.4m from sales of Pounds 337.1m.
Margins improved from 7.6 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively.
Chubb made an exceptional charge of Pounds 7.82m, mainly for redundancy and
reorganisation costs. Sir Ernest expected further exceptional items this
year for rationalisation of manufacturing sites and the closure of some
monitoring stations.
The tax rate fell from 47 per cent to 38.6 per cent.
Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said the group had built no assumptions
of market growth into its growth forecasts. 'It is all a question of market
penetration,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Betterware chief cuts holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Cohen, chief executive of Betterware, the home shopping company,
and his parents, have reduced by 13 per cent their stake in the company he
has built up over the last 10 years. The sales raised about Pounds 30m.
The shares were placed mainly with UK institutions by BZW and Albert E Sharp
at 230p. Betterware's shares recovered after an early fall to close 8p down
at 240p.
Mr Cohen said the sales were in response to demand for the company's shares,
which were tightly held, and the sale would improve their marketability. 'We
decided the time was right,' he said.
However, he said there would be no further sales in 'the foreseeable
future'.
Following the sale, the stake held by Mr Cohen, fellow directors and their
families will fall from 63 per cent to 50.3 per cent. Mr Cohen said he
intended to maintain the controlling shareholding at this level.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson Pounds 21m rights to cut
borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; Jackson, which owns the Poundstretcher discount retail chain,
yesterday surprised the market by announcing its second rights issue in just
over a year to raise Pounds 21m.
The 2-for-5 cash call at 12p will be used to reduce borrowings and finance a
store opening programme. The existing shares slipped  1/2 p to 14 1/2 p.
Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said: 'The last rights took us far enough out
of a hole to see daylight; we are now going forward.'
Shareholders were last tapped for funds after the company's restructuring
was completed in April 1992. The group established a three year plan to
maximise the profitability of its 260 stores.
The group, which has undergone a management shake-up as it reverted to a
December year-end, recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 967,000 on
turnover of Pounds 241.9m in the 15 months to December 31. Mr Gray said new
finance was needed to take advantage of opportunities in the market.
Some Pounds 13m of the new proceeds will be used to buy 15 new stores this
year and a further 45 the following year.
Borrowings, which averaged Pounds 19m last year, will be reduced by Pounds
6m. The remaining Pounds 2m is expected to be used for further acquisitions.
Mr Gray said he was confident that the Pounds 21m was enough to fund working
capital for growth. 'We are not about to take a nibble now only to come back
for a nibble next year. We have had our rescue rights and we are now having
one for growth'.
The existing stores will continue to be upgraded. The electronic point of
sale system has been extended from 57 to 195 stores in the last year and is
scheduled to be installed in all stores by the end of the year.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Receivers at Palmerston subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three subsidiaries of Palmerston Holdings, the property group, have had
receivers appointed by Hill Samuel Bank after they were unable to meet a
demand to repay Pounds 10.4m of loans by June 7.
The announcement was made last night after the market had closed. The shares
were unchanged at 15p.
The companies in receivership are Reliable Properties, Florin Properties and
Benjamin &amp; Edward. In January Palmerston announced it had breached its
banking covenants, partly because the value of its properties had declined,
and partly because of the support its associate companies required.
Further, Borodin Properties, another subsidiary, has requested in writing
for Bankers Trust and the Bank of Yokohama to appoint an official receiver
as it is unable to meet current and future tax liabilities. The current debt
to the banks is Pounds 3.7m.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ex-chief quits Hartstone board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTSTONE Group, the hosiery and leather goods company which recently issued
two profits warnings within a week, said Mr Stephen Barker, its former
chairman and chief executive, was resigning from the board.
Mr Shaun Dowling, who last month took over as chairman, said Mr Barker 'was
sick to death with the drama over the last few weeks.'
Hartstone's latest warning said pre-tax profits were likely to be reduced by
a further Pounds 260,000 after arrangements came to light involving payments
over four years totalling Pounds 1m to employees of a subsidiary company.
Mr Mike Small, the former company treasurer, also arranged for certain funds
derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract to be paid to an account
for his benefit. He has been replaced by Mr Martin Randle, controller of the
group's US operations.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has undertaken a thorough review of the current
financial position ahead of any refinancing arrangement, yesterday reported
to the group's banks.
The full year results, which are due at the end of June, are likely to be
delayed until July.
Hartstone recently said it had breached at least one banking covenant
calling for 2.5 times interest cover. Interest charges at the half-way stage
had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Dowling said the breach of one covenant meant that all were being
reviewed.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ACT advances 20% to Pounds 20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computer software and services group,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits
underpinned by strong organic growth in its core financial software products
business.
Pre-tax profits advanced to a record Pounds 20.5m in the year to March 31,
compared to Pounds 17m, which included exceptional investment profits of
Pounds 1.04m. Turnover rose 28 per cent from Pounds 119.4m to Pounds 153m,
including Pounds 7.11m from acquisitions.
Earnings per share increased by 4.6 per cent to 11.33p (10.83p) and an
increased final dividend of 3.25p (3p) per share is proposed making a total
for the year of 5p (4.5p).
Operating profits, including Pounds 1.15m from acquisitions, increased to
Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 15m), while net interest income fell to Pounds 1.4m
(Pounds 2.02m) mainly as a result of lower interest rates. The group ended
the year with net cash of Pounds 25m.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said the core financial software product
companies, ACT Financial Systems and ACT Kindle, had 'an excellent year'
with strong organic growth in sales and profits. They now represent more
than 75 per cent of total profits.
In financial systems a strong performance by the UK division was accompanied
by further growth in the international subsidiaries. NMW Computers, which
was acquired in November, has been successfully integrated and made a
positive contribution in the second half.
Kindle, the Irish banking software house, also maintained the strong organic
growth experienced since its acquisition in December 1991 and continued its
international expansion with orders from 25 new banking customers. Eastern
Europe, in particular, was said to be becoming a significant area of new
business.
ACT's other main division, UK Software and Services, managed to improve its
performance 'substantially' in the second half as a result of strong
management action and increased demand. Second half operating profits jumped
to Pounds 4.2m, against Pounds 1.4m in the first half.
COMMENT
These results answer some criticism of the group's rapid expansion through
acquisition and show that ACT can indeed grow its business organically.
Financial and banking software is now clearly established as the core
business. The international market for financial and banking software is
growing by more than 15 per cent a year and is also very profitable. ACT is
itself becoming increasingly international with overseas sales now exceeding
Pounds 30m. This year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 24m are likely,
producing earnings per share of about 13.2p. Based on yesterday's close of
152p, up 9p, the stock is trading on a prospective p/e of 11.5 and is
probably undervalued.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure falls into the red after
property write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKS LEISURE, the fashion retailer and sports wholesaler, yesterday
incurred a loss before tax of Pounds 564,000 in the year ended February 27,
its first deficit for five years.
The outcome compared with the previous year's pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.7m.
The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 600,000, mainly
relating to the write-down of properties.
Blacks recently sold the LA Gear distribution business for Pounds 2.35m,
reducing year-end gearing from 35 to 8 per cent.
It also closed the loss-making textile converting and merchanting operation
which gave rise to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 9.6m, which includes
goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, criticised the new
accounting rules which stipulate that both extraordinary and exceptional
items should go above the line.
'Under FRS 3 it would have looked as if we had made a Pounds 10m loss when
in fact we were making an operating profit'.
Retail, which sells camping and sporting goods, suffered a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 858,000, compared to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.9m. Mr Bentley
described the result as 'disappointing' but not unexpected given what was
happening to the company's markets.
The distribution operation saw pre-tax profits decline from Pounds 4m to
Pounds 2m.
The company blamed the fall on the fact that many of its retail customers
over-stocked and were therefore reluctant to place forward order
commitments.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Betterware shares fall as chief cuts
holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Cohen, chief executive of Betterware, the home shopping company,
and his parents, have reduced by 13 per cent their stake in the company he
has built up over the last 10 years. The sales raised about Pounds 30m.
The shares were placed mainly with UK institutions by BZW and Albert E Sharp
at 230p. Betterware's shares recovered after an early fall to close 8p down
at 240p.
Mr Cohen said the sales were in response to demand for the company's shares,
which were tightly held, and the sale would improve their marketability. 'We
decided the time was right,' he said.
However, he said there would be no further sales in 'the foreseeable
future'. Following the sale, the stake held by Mr Cohen, fellow directors
and their families will fall from 63 per cent to 50.3 per cent. Mr Cohen
said he intended to maintain the controlling shareholding at this level.
The disposal was unexpected on the stock market, where analysts pointed to
comments made by Mr Cohen in a Sunday newspaper last month. Mr Cohen said in
an interview that he had no intention of reducing his stake, which has now
fallen from 28 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Cohen's parents have reduced
their stake from 29 per cent to 22.5 per cent.
According to Betterware's annual report, delivered to shareholders
yesterday, Mr Cohen received a 35 per cent pay rise last year. His salary
and benefits increased 25 per cent to Pounds 130,484, while his performance
pay increased 35 per cent to Pounds 254,784. Earnings and pre-tax profits
both increased by more than 70 per cent during the year.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heseltine called on to launch inquiry into
events at Alpine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has been urged to launch
an investigation into events at Alpine (Double Glazing), the windows company
which ceased trading at the end of May.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, yesterday sent a letter to Mr
Heseltine voicing concerns over the whereabouts and status of employees'
pension payments.
He asks Mr Heseltine to 'institute inquiries into the activities of Alpine
and those associated with it and, should it be necessary, refer your
findings to the Serious Fraud Office.'
About Pounds 50,000 of pension monies are in a solicitor's account,
according to the receiver, Mr Grant Jones of Morison Stoneham who was
appointed on Friday. However, it is unclear whether employees will have
rights to these funds.
Mr Radice's letter adds that since Alpine 'was sold in early 1992', with the
backing of Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith, the company's activities
and administration have been open to question.
Mr Radice, acting on behalf of those employed at the Alpine factory in his
constituency, also appealed to Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, to
confirm that they were entitled to statutory rights under the Insolvency
Fund.
The DTI refused to comment yesterday on Mr Radice's letter. However, it is
understood that representatives of the department met former employees of
Alpine earlier this year following a series of complaints over events at the
company.
Separately, trading standards officers are investigating Alpine (Double
Glazing) for allegedly using the logo of the Glass and Glazing Federation
after its membership had lapsed.
Mr Brian Hern, director of the Glass and Glazing Federation,said Alpine's
membership of the trade association was terminated in September 1991.
Ms Helen Lamb of Brent Ealing and Harrow trading standards service said:
'Investigations are continuing into Alpine over an allegation of offences
under the Trade Description Act. The allegation is of using the Glass and
Glazing Federation logo after their membership had lagged.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LYNX Holdings, the USM-quoted computer services and leisure products
company, yesterday announced that it was to make an acquisition, raise
additional working capital of Pounds 1.25m and move to the Official List.
Lynx has conditionally agreed to acquire Signal, a provider of computer
systems, software and support services to motor dealerships, for a total of
Pounds 1.5m. Signal made operating profits of Pounds 209,000 on turnover of
Pounds 2.04m in 1992.
The consideration for Signal's share capital is Pounds 1m, to be satisfied
by the issue of 3.28m new shares. In addition Lynx will repay the Signal
directors' loan accounts and other indebtedness amounting to Pounds 500,000.
Lynx plans to raise Pounds 1.75m before expenses via a cash placing of 5.83m
shares at 30p each.
The cash will be used to discharge the indebtedness of Signal, provide
additional working capital and cover the expenses of the acquisition and
move to a full listing.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen rises 64% to Pounds
75.9m - Strong performance from all core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing
group, yesterday reported a strong performance by its core activities and
was optimistic regarding growth opportunities.
Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits expanded by 64 per cent to Pounds 75.9m and
earnings per share almost doubled to 19.1p (10p). The new accountancy
standard had little impact on the latest figures, but the previous year's
comparatives were slashed by including an extraordinary charge of Pounds
19.1m above the line.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said: 'On the old accountancy basis both
pre-tax profits and earnings per share are up by over 11 per cent. We are
delighted to report that all our business service activities have moved
ahead.'
The distribution division, which makes 44 per cent of group trading profits,
increased trading profits by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 35.1m, with continental
Europe and the US showing good advances.
In the more mature UK market, where the group supplies retailers such as J
Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, distribution profits increased by 3.5 per
cent to Pounds 20.5m.
Trading profits from specialist hire increased by 19.3 per cent to Pounds
28.4m, in spite of a disappointing performance from Light and Sound Design,
which suffered from the slump in pop concerts in Europe and the US.
Salvesen Food Services, which processes and freezes own-label vegetables,
increased trading profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, in spite a small
reduction in the volumes processed.
Salvesen Brick's trading profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.7m,
although the business increased its share of a sharply reduced market.
Cashflow remained strong, helped by the Pounds 28.5m proceeds from the sale
of the group's Oilfield Technology subsidiary. Gearing fell from 34.9 per
cent to 14.5 per cent.
Under FRS 3, earnings per share rose to 19.1p (10p). A final dividend of
4.6p (4.1p) gives a total of 7.8p (7p), an increase of 11.4 per cent.
COMMENT
The headline figures were in line with expectations, although a strong
performance by distribution compensated for the hire division's
disappointments. Mr Masters is happy with the balance of the group, which
now obtains 95 per cent of trading profits from business-to-business
services. That strong defensive stance accounts for the re-rating which the
group's shares have enjoyed in the past three years. Forecast profits of
Pounds 85m put the shares, down 4p to to 352p, on a prospective multiple of
16.5. The 15 per cent premium to the market is well deserved on a long-term
view of the group and its quality management, but the shares may continue to
mark time while institutions focus on shares with more immediate recovery
potential.

FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Control Tech up sharply to Pounds 3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL TECHNIQUES, the Powys-based electronic drives group, yesterday
reported sharply higher interim profits.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 increased to Pounds 3.72m
against Pounds 1.57m in the comparable period when they were depressed by
reorganisation costs and other disruptions. Both periods included about
Pounds 200,000 of rationalisation costs. Turnover increased by 25 per cent
from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 54.2m.
After a higher tax charge of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 600,000) earnings per share
increased to 5.9p (2.3p) and the interim dividend is raised by 9 per cent to
2.35p (2.15p).
Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the improvements were mainly due to
organic growth and continuing tight cost controls. Order books were up about
20 per cent on the same time last year, he added.
The chairman said almost all the group's companies were trading ahead of the
same period last year.
Sales via distributors increased by 31 per cent, as did sales through the
group's expanding number of CT Drive Centres which now total 17, including
one in Turkey opened this week.
Negotiations are continuing on establishing Drive Centres in Spain, the
Czech Republic, Austria, India and China.
Meanwhile the group is continuing the rationalisation and integration of
ICD, its US subsidiary, acquired in 1991.
Profitability is expected to be further improved as product substitution is
completed.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Dealers concerned at Zeneca outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUB-UNDERWRITERS of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue by Zeneca, the
pharmaceuticals division spun off from ICI, are concerned they will not be
able to dispose of the shares profitably once the deal closes on June 21.
Zeneca shares yesterday closed at 617p, down 3p, just 3 per cent above the
600p rights issue price and yielding roughly 5.5 per cent. The shares on
Wednesday had traded as low as 609p.
Institutions said that brokers to the Zeneca issue had told them the dip in
the share price had reflected selling by US investors concerned about the
effects of health care reform.
There is also fear that if the Zeneca issue is seen to flop it could depress
the stockmarket, affecting the sale of BT shares next month.
The Zeneca rights issue has an added twist in that a syndicate of
international banks was formed to sell the rights shares to new investors
outside the UK. One observer said this 'recycling' element was meeting poor
demand judging by low trading volumes in the nil-paid shares. Zeneca's
brokers declined to comment.
Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, said 'a U-shaped price pattern
over a rights issue period is quite normal'.
Sub-underwriters, the large British institutional investors, said ICI
shareholders, entitled to purchase Zeneca shares at 600p in proportion to
their ICI stake, are likely to decline to exercise that right if the shares
fall below 605p. The shares had traded in the grey market as high as 700p
before terms of the rights offering were announced.
'We are happy to take up our rights and we are happy to take up our
underwriting if there is a stick. But we will not do both,' said one leading
UK institution.
'We thought 600p was top of the range to begin with,' said one fund manager,
adding his fund had wavered before agreeing to underwrite roughly 1.5 per
cent of the issue, in line with its ICI stake.
Several institutions, however, said the underlying prospects for the shares
were far better than their current trading price implies. One fund manager,
who said he had agreed to underwrite a position larger than his ICI holding,
said: 'I hope the shareholders walk away at 600p. We think the shares are
good value at that price.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Gateway chief may get bonus of Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID SIMONS, chief executive of the Gateway supermarket chain, would
earn a Pounds 16.6m bonus if the group ever returned to its one-time
valuation of Pounds 1.8bn.
The management bonus scheme was published in a document yesterday after the
Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing of Gateway parent Isosceles was signed by its
bankers. The document said 'the operation of the long-term bonus plan may
result in substantial payments to David Simons'.
Mr Simons said yesterday the target Pounds 1.8bn value for Gateway, needed
to raise the total bonus for senior managers to Pounds 50m, was 'totally
unrealistic'. Isosceles paid more than Pounds 2bn for Gateway through a
leveraged buy-out in 1989, but since then parts of the business have been
sold.
The maximum Pounds 50m pay-out, of which Mr Simons would receive one third,
would be triggered only if all the company's debts were repaid with interest
and the original shareholders began to get their money back. Mr Simons said
that if that happened, shareholders 'would be so delighted they would be
happy to reward the management team'.
Mr Simons said it was more probable that Gateway's value would rise to
Pounds 500m, which would give him a share of a half to a third of a Pounds
4.5m bonus fund.
Management can also earn annual bonuses if profits exceed budgets, with a
maximum bonus of 100 per cent of salary if profits are 70 per cent over
budget.
Large incentive packages are becoming a standard feature of refinancing
deals where companies are rescued from insolvency.
Mr Simons, a former finance director at Storehouse, was brought into Gateway
in January to try to reverse declining sales volumes and falling profits.
Isosceles yesterday published interim results for the period to November 7
1992, which showed a fall in operating profits from Pounds 102.3m to Pounds
71.2m on static sales of Pounds 1.6bn. A further fall in operating profits
is expected in the second half, to give a figure of about Pounds 100m for
the year to April 24.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 190.6m, interest charges of Pounds 106.6m and
other write-offs meant a total loss for the half-year of Pounds 306.4m.
Gateway's balance sheet shows net assets of Pounds 302.5m.

FT  11 JUN 93 / French luxury goods maker's shares fall on profit warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods company, yesterday warned of a reduction in
net profits for the first half of 1993.
Its shares fell on the announcement, closing down FFr27 at FFr3,683.
The group, which owns Moet-et-Chandon champagne, Louis Vuitton luggage and
the Christian Lacroix fashion house, made FFr1.3bn (Pounds 150m) in the
first six months of last year.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that
full-year net profits would nevertheless at least match those of 1992, when
it made FFr3bn on sales of FFr21.7bn.
The LVMH warning comes against a background of intense pressure on the
luxury goods industry because of global recession and a shift in consumer
taste away from the ostentatious values of the 1980s.
Dunhill, the British group behind Mont Blanc pens and the Karl Lagerfeld
fashion business, last week announced lower profits for last year.
Mr Arnault said group sales had risen 4.5 per cent in the first five months
of this year. He attributed the profits fall to the depressed economic
environment and problems in the champagne market. Producers have been hit by
poor sales and high grape prices.
LVMH recently announced the first-ever job losses at Moet-et-Chandon, its
flagship champagne house, triggering protests from the workforce last week.
Mr Arnault said LVMH would fell the impact of the weak pound on its income
from Guinness, the UK drinks group where it is a 24 per cent investor. Last
year's cut in the Guinness contribution (to FFr681m from FFr1.1bn in 1991)
was one of the main reasons for the overall decline in LVMH's net profits to
FFr3bn from FFr3.7bn.
LVMH, which has net debt of FFr14.5bn, expects to benefit from recent falls
in French interest rates. Mr Patrick Houel, finance director, said the group
would save FFr60m a year for every 1 per cent rate cut.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Wimpey launches first rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE Wimpey, the UK construction group, yesterday broke with history by
announcing the first rights issue since its formation 110 years ago.
The company is raising Pounds 104m in the one-for-four issue at 148p a
share. Wimpey's share price, which had almost trebled since sterling left
the ERM last September, yesterday slipped 3p to 184p.
It said the proceeds would be used to buy land to take advantage of recovery
in the UK housing market. Quarry businesses in the UK and US would also be
modernised and expanded.
In March, Grove Charity Management, a charitable trust established in 1955
by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, Wimpey's founder, placed the bulk of its 34 per
cent stake. This is thought to have cleared the way for the rights issue.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said that since the beginning of this year
the group had sold 55 per cent more UK homes - including sales to housing
associations - than during the first five months of last year. 'I firmly
believe that a housing market recovery is under way at last, although
progress is likely to be gradual rather than dramatic.'
Private sector sales alone rose 27 per cent despite a normal seasonal
slowdown in May.
'House prices prices have stopped falling and builders have begun to reduce
some of the sales incentives introduced during the recession. Recovery in
the general construction industry, however, is unlikely to occur before
1995,' said Mr Dwyer.
He expected that by next year land prices would rise again. It made sense to
increase the size of the group's land holdings before this happened to
'enable the group to achieve attractive margins on sales in 1994 and 1995'.
This year UK house sales by Wimpey were expected to rise from 5,600 to at
least 7,000. Analysts say the group is aiming to build 9,000 homes a year by
the mid to late 1990s, making it the country's largest housebuilder, ahead
of Tarmac, the current market leader.
Wimpey said its net debt, reduced from more than Pounds 350m two years ago
to Pounds 136m at the end of last year, had risen since the year-end to
Pounds 159m due to a normal seasonal upturn in working capital requirements.
Grove is not expected to take up the rights attached to its remaining 5 per
cent stake. The issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and the
brokers are Cazenove. Wimpey expects to pay a minimum total dividend for
this year of 5.25p on the increased equity, the same as last year.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi gives debt details under watchdog pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group fell further yesterday amid
growing concern about the rescue deal being thrashed out with its main
bankers and controversy over the size of its borrowings.
The falls came as a ministerial committee in Rome postponed until today
discussion of a proposal by the Bank of Italy to allow commercial banks to
take stakes in industrial companies. A debt-for-equity swap is one of the
possibilities being discussed by Ferruzzi with a five-bank creditors'
committee.
The controversy over Ferruzzi's indebtedness came to a head on Wednesday
night, when the group issued a detailed balance sheet ahead of its general
meeting later this month. The figures confirmed net indebtedness of the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company at L15,123bn (Pounds 6.71bn).
However, the figures also indirectly confirmed press claims this week that
the group's total debts approached L31,500bn. The higher figure, strongly
denied by Ferruzzi on Wednesday, comprises Ferfin's gross debts of L25,346bn
in Ferfin, the gross indebtedness of the commodity trading activities at
L3,913bn and an estimated L900bn in gross debts at Serafino Ferruzzi, the
family holding company.
Ferruzzi said the borrowings of its commodity trading business had not
traditionally been consolidated in the group total, as they were subject to
sharp fluctuations and backed by physical commodities or futures contracts.
The company declined to comment on the indebtedness of Serafino Ferruzzi.
The group produced the more comprehensive figures after the Milan stock
exchange's ruling council asked Italy's Consob stock exchange watchdog to
take action, which could have involved suspending trading in the shares.
Consob continues to monitor the situation closely. Yesterday it summoned Mr
Carlo Sama, Ferfin's managing director, and creditor banks. After the
meeting, Mr Sama said Ferruzzi had no intention of seeking a suspension.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Pilkington cuts dividend for the second time: Profits more
than halved as German market collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON yesterday cut its annual dividend by a third to 4p, despite
having held the interim payment in December.
The share price fell 6p to 130p.
Last summer the glass group, whose profits have slumped during the
recession, cut its dividend for the first time since it went public in 1970.
Pilkington, which makes two interim payments, last year reduced the second
interim from 7.57p to 3.07p. This time it has been cut to 1.07p. The first
interim has been held at 2.93p.
Annual pre-tax profits for the year to March fell from Pounds 95.7m to
Pounds 40.7m on sales of Pounds 2.57bn, against Pounds 2.61bn.
The dividend cut saves the company Pounds 16m plus associated tax payments.
Even so, the high tax charge of Pounds 46m, up from Pounds 43.8m, and the
remaining dividend bill caused a retained loss of Pounds 51.4m, compared
with a deficit of Pounds 20.1m. The loss per share was 2.6p against earnings
of 3.5p.
In December the company justified holding the dividend by saying it was
'marginally more optimistic'. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said
yesterday that most of the encouraging trends the group had seen in December
had continued, but there had also been 'a dramatic collapse' in Germany,
where the situation remained uncertain. Pilkington's German business
contributed a third of group operating profits.
In January, the German carmakers which Pilkington supplies, such as Mercedes
and BMW, 'virtually shut down for four weeks,' said Mr Roger Leverton, chief
executive. Sales of glass to the housebuilding industry had held up but
prices were under pressure.
Analysts speculated that the dividend cut showed Mr Leverton, who joined the
group in July last year, had had more of a say in the decision. Sir Antony
is thought to have wanted to maintain the payout.
Sir Antony said that improving signs included a pick up in profits in the
group's southern hemisphere operations, and the 'amazing difference' that
sterling's devaluation had made to the UK operations' competitiveness. In
the second half of the financial year float glass volumes were the highest
they had been for three years. Costs savings had been achieved and an 8 per
cent price rise in the UK was sticking.
Although group borrowings had risen from Pounds 760m to Pounds 932m, Sir
Antony said there was no need for a rights issue as disposals would cut
debt.
He added that an investigation was progressing at Libbey-Owens-Ford -
Pilkington's North American subsidiary where three top executives, including
the president, have been suspended after apparent breaches of company
procedures. Legal proceedings against a third party had been instituted. The
business was continuing normally.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Clough denies personal payments for transfers: Venables
spoke of 'bagfuls of money', says Sugar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-STANDING claims that unorthodox financial practices are commonplace in
British soccer were fuelled yesterday when it was alleged that Mr Brian
Clough, the former manager of Nottingham Forest football club, received
personal payments when transferring players to other clubs.
The claim was made by Mr Alan Sugar, the Tottenham Hotspur chairman, in an
affidavit submitted to the High Court hearing into his attempt to sack the
Spurs chief executive, Mr Terry Venables.
The allegation was strongly denied by lawyers for Mr Venables.
Mr Martin Mann QC, for Mr Venables, claimed that Mr Sugar had attempted to
pervert the course of justice by threatening Mr Jonathan Crystal, who is a
barrister, fellow Tottenham director and ally of the chief executive, unless
he dropped crucial evidence from his affidavit. A separate hearing on this
issue is due to start on Monday.
In his affidavit, Mr Sugar claimed that when Mr Venables was trying to buy
Mr Teddy Sheringham, the England international, from Nottingham Forest for
Pounds 2.1m, he told the Spurs chairman that Mr Clough 'likes a bung' - a
personal payment - to make transfers go smoothly.
Mr Venables had told him the usual procedure was for Mr Clough to be met in
a motorway service station where he would be given a bagful of money, Mr
Sugar claimed.
The allegation was strongly denied by both Mr Venables and Mr Clough.
In an affidavit submitted to the court, Mr Venables described the claims as
'bizarre' and 'a lot of nonsense'. Mr Clough also denied that any money had
passed between himself and Mr Venables over the transfer.
'The last time I was in a motorway service station, I went for a wee,' he
said.
Relations between Mr Sugar and Mr Venables had now deteriorated to such an
extent that one of them would have to sell his shares and leave the club, Mr
Mann said.
He accused Mr Sugar of reneging on an agreement, reached when the two men
first took control of the club in June 1991, that they would retain equal
voting rights.
After the club's rights issue in November 1991, when Mr Sugar extended his
stake in the club from 23 per cent to 46 per cent, the chairman began a
campaign to undermine Mr Venables's position, he said.
In one case, Mr Sugar negotiated a deal with BSkyB without making any
reference to Mr Venables, Mr Mann said.
The hearing is expected to end today.

FT  11 JUN 93 / BAe wins Pounds 500m order from Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has won a contract estimated to be worth Pounds 500m to
supply Hawk combat trainer jets to Indonesia.
The deal, signed secretly last week and announced yesterday, is the biggest
military export the company has made outside Saudi Arabia.
The sale involves 24 aircraft with weapons, spares and training. It is
likely to be controversial because of Indonesia's human rights record in the
former Portuguese territory of East Timor.
Although the Hawk is designed as a trainer, BAe literature makes clear it is
also well suited to ground attack.
BAe refused to comment on the specifications of the aircraft being sold, or
whether they included the dedicated single-seat fighter version, the Hawk
200, as well as the twin-seat Hawk 100. BAe said that they could all be
regarded as being for training purposes.
The contract, which follows protracted negotiations, was delayed by a recent
reshuffle of Indonesia's top military commanders by President Suharto.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, who announced the sale at the Paris air
show, said it had been 'a very long struggle'.
The deal will bring extra work to BAe's northern England plants at Brough,
Warton and Samlesbury. It includes Rolls-Royce engines worth Pounds 50m.
It also leaves open the possibility of a further Indonesian order. BAe and
IPTN, Indonesia's state aircraft construction company, signed a
collaboration agreement two years ago. Mr Bacharrudin Habibie, IPTN
chairman, has indicated Indonesia could require up to 96 Hawks.
Jetstream, the BAe regional aircraft subsidiary, yesterday announced plans
for a new generation of turbo-prop airliners.
Mr Allan MacDonald, Jet-stream's managing director, said up to 50 per cent
of the Pounds 450m development costs would need to be provided by the
government.
Plans for the Jetstream 71 and 51 would secure 2,500 jobs at the company's
Prestwick base in Strathclyde.

FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Racal/Chubb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal is an example of constructive divorce in action. Over the past five
years, Racal shareholders have done well by spinning off Chubb and Vodafone.
The three companies now have a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 6bn:
before the process started Racal was worth only Pounds 1.55bn. When the
Pounds 400m injection from the sale of the first 20 per cent of Vodafone is
included, the value of the companies has trebled since 1988, while the FT-A
All-Share index is only up by 55 per cent. Since the Chubb demerger was
announced, the FT-SE mid 250 index has risen by 47 per cent while Racal and
Chubb are up by 61 per cent. The outperformance is equivalent to a rise in
the old-style Racal shares from 65p to 75p, which is approximately what the
company's advisers suggested would be the impact of demerger. Williams must
now wish it had increased its bid.
Much of the overall rise in value has come from Vodafone's extraordinarily
profitable cellular phone business. It is hard to know what would have
happened without a split, but the experience must give Securicor pause over
its stake in Cellnet. US interest in Vodafone certainly increased when it
became a purely cellular operation. Vodafone's management has since
concentrated on expansion, and Chubb's on cost-cutting. Ironically, both
demergers were defensive responses to predators - as is ICI's split. That,
however, is hardly liberating a Vodafone-style boom business, so ICI's
shareholders must hope that management can pare away at costs to release
more limited value.

FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison is an acid test for Italian
capitalism. The 1988 deal by which Meta, Montedison's retail and financial
services subsidiary, was shunted into the then unquoted Ferruzzi remains a
notorious example of how not to treat minority shareholders. The sight of
Mediobanca once again orchestrating raises old fears. The hope must be that
Italy's desire to maintain international goodwill - notably for the
privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two of the
creditor banks - will dictate an equitable solution.
Since the Bank of Italy has been pressing for banks to be allowed wider
shareholdings, a debt-for-equity swap could be on the cards. The danger then
lies in letting the banks walk away with too much. Despite its debts, the
empire contains some attractive assets. A large slice of debt will be
deconsolidated if the proposed plastics venture with Shell can be tied up.
The Edison power business is another jewel, as is Fondiaria insurance, if
Ferruzzi can be persuaded to sell.
The broader question is how another of Italy's big industrial groups has
been allowed to get into such a mess. The lack of big institutional
investors to keep management in check must be partly to blame. Perhaps the
advent of private pension funds will tilt the balance of power. The
state-owned banking system has also been too willing to support corporate
giants. An orderly break-up for Ferruzzi - and privatisation for the banks -
cannot come soon enough.

FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington has such a wretched recent history that it is hard to give it the
benefit of the doubt. Yesterday's dividend cut may thus be widely seen as
vindicating the view that the payment should have been trimmed last December
when the German car industry was already heading for serious trouble. If
Pilkington's judgment was wrong then, there is no reason why it should be
any better now. Protestations that it is getting to grips with its cost base
and determined to reduce its debt without a large rights issue ring hollow
when the company still seems subject to such drift.
At such moments, though, obsession with past mistakes is dangerous. It can
obscure the turn. There is also room for a more positive view. Mr Roger
Leverton, the new chief executive, is starting to make his presence felt.
The acquisition of Heywood Williams' glass distribution business will help.
So will Italy's SIV - assuming it can be bought at a reasonable price.
Even so, Pilkington's recovery cannot be anything other than painfully slow.
It will probably be three years before dividend cover is anything like
reasonable. Despite the planned disposal of the US Sola business and its
high operational gearing, the company will struggle to reduce its near 90
per cent gearing. A more radical programme of disposals - even extending to
the lucrative southern hemisphere - may be needed. With the shares up over
80 per cent since last October, the market must be betting either that Mr
Leverton will persuade his masters of this necessity or that a bidder will
end up doing it for him.

FT  11 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Wimpey's building blocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be tempting to view Wimpey's Pounds 104m rights issue as a sign
that sunny days are here again for the UK's volume housebuilders. The 55 per
cent increase in Wimpey's housing sales this year and its suggestions that
prices are firming only reinforces the impression. Investors taking a long
view will doubtless appreciate the issue's attractions. Wimpey has lost
almost 40 per cent of its shareholder funds since 1989. But now may be the
time to bolster its balance sheet to gear up for recovery. Fresh money will
be pumped into cheap land and Wimpey's cash-starved quarry businesses at the
bottom of the cycle. Wimpey can move from defensive to offensive mode.
Unfortunately, the industry's forthcoming results season could reveal a
different picture. The surge in housing sales is from an extremely depressed
base, with margins remaining under pressure. Wimpey's contracting market is
unlikely to pick up until at least 1995. Its minerals business, too, will
lag recovery. Things would grow sticky if interest rates rise again later
this year. With the sector on a forward multiple of more than 20, there is
little room for disappointment.
Having seen Wimpey's shares run up from 67p to 187p since September, Mr Joe
Dwyer would have had to have been wearing a particularly prickly hair shirt
to have shunned the opportunity to tap the market. But that only reinforces
the suspicion that Wimpey, at least, did not believe its shares had much
further to run. Shareholders might perhaps take the hint.

FT  11 JUN 93 / 3i seeking up to Dollars 400m to fund investment in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S largest venture capital group, 3i, is attempting to raise between
Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m (Pounds 197m and Pounds 263m) to finance an
ambitious expansion of its investment activity in continental Europe.
This is the first time 3i has sought to manage outside funds and would
represent the biggest fund-raising by a UK venture capital group for several
years.
The group, owned by Britain's leading clearing banks and the Bank of
England, is a significant provider of finance to small and medium-sized
businesses.
3i said last March it was considering the possibility of raising outside
finance but played down the significance of the move, saying it was just one
of several options it had been considering. Investment management sources,
however, said this week that 3i was actively seeking to raise Dollars 300m
to Dollars 400m.
Mr Neil Cross, 3i's international director, said yesterday: 'We were
encouraged by the response we had (in March) and we spoke to more people.
Some have said they will put money up but until people have signed up you
never know. I don't think we will firm up on whether it will happen or not
until the autumn.'
Asked to confirm the size of the proposed fund, Mr Cross said: 'I would have
guessed you are talking about sums of that order.'
3i has focused its fund-raising on large investment institutions in the US
and continental Europe and is believed to have obtained a commitment for
Dollars 100m from a large US pension fund. It has been very selective in
targeting UK institutions, which have proved reluctant to increase their
venture capital invest-ments during the past two years.
UK investment institutions said 3i might have difficulty raising such a
large amount of money, given its lack of a track record for managing other
people's funds. 3i has financed previous investments from its own equity,
bond issues and retained profits. It announced in April that it was calling
off long-standing plans for a public listing.
Raising outside funds allows venture capital companies to finance larger
deals, maximise the use of their investment expertise and spread their costs
over a larger portfolio.
Several other venture capital funds expressed concern that 3i's fund-raising
would suck the market dry.
More than 40 UK venture companies are currently attempting to raise money,
while many others have had to scale down or abandon fund-raising campaigns
over the past 12-18 months.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Difficult recipe for a bigger cake: The first round of EC
enlargement talks was successful, but the hard bargaining is just beginning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Luxembourg this week, the first round of the negotiations to bring
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the European Community was
virtually wrapped up at a series of meetings between foreign ministers of
the 12 and their Nordic and Alpine counterparts. As a result, the Copenhagen
summit of EC heads of government in 10 days will have a modest success to
acclaim.
But what has been achieved since enlargement talks started in February
amounts to little more than moving the first pawns in a multi-dimensional
chess game. The tricky moves, as the largely ceremonial Luxembourg talks
made clear, start now.
Differing expectations among the 12 about how enlargement will change the
Community are complicating the negotiations. The talks are already stuck in
a morass of intimidating detail, as the two sides work through lists of
demands from the applicants.
No one doubts that the shape of European integration will be transformed if
the candidates - all members of the loose European Free Trade Association
(Efta) - enter the Community as planned in 1995. That has been the
experience with previous EC enlargements, although this one is bigger.
With Danish voters last month changing their minds about ratifying the
Maastricht treaty, there is renewed optimism among former Efta members of
the Community, including the UK and Denmark itself. They hope that accession
by the four will tilt the balance of power decisively away from the
federalist core of the EC - the founding six, France, Germany, the Benelux
countries and Italy - reinforced by Spain.
Relief among the federalists at Maastricht's survival is tempered by fears
among some that 'widening' of the EC may come at the expense of 'deepening',
that is, a more integrated European union. Among southern member states,
this suspicion is heightened by fear that expansion could shift the
Community's centre of political gravity northwards.
Previous enlargements have led to marked deepening as well as widening. But
following the popular backlash across Europe against Maastricht, it is less
certain how the proposed new expansion would affect the distribution of
power in the EC. Nonetheless, the probability remains that, as in the past,
the enlargement will gradually reinforce the power of the Community.
When the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the EC in 1973, federalists blamed
the enlargement for what was viewed as the Community's near paralysis in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. There is, however, a distinction between
paralysis and, as the Emperor Augustus put it, hastening slowly. The
Community moved slowly indeed, but clearly towards greater integration.
As a result of that 1973 enlargement, the EC agreed a loose foreign policy
co-ordination mechanism (European Political Co-operation, or EPC) - a
trade-off for France's dropping its veto on UK entry - and its own budgetary
resources. These appeared modest initiatives, and indeed the revenue
decision led to a long war of attrition over EC budget contributions,
dominated by the UK. Yet these budget rows have led to the two Delors
finance packages of 1988 and 1992, which in each case included a doubling of
regional spending, arguably the EC's most federalist policy.
The need to spend on developing the poorer south, in particular, arose from
the second enlargement, which brought in Greece in 1981, and Spain and
Portugal in 1986. But that expansion also reinforced the case for majority
voting and a weakening of national vetoes in EC decision-making, decisive in
getting the EC's single market into law. All these seemingly modest
increments combined to add greatly to the political density and identity of
the EC. Indeed, the common foreign and security policy and extension of
majority voting foreseen by Maastricht developed organically from the
earlier moves. The EC, in its willy-nilly way, has a habit of creating
problems only to look for solutions through greater integration.
In the present case, despite federalists' fears, it is already clear that
the Scandinavians and Austria favour even more majority voting in a host of
areas, which would further dilute the ability of member states, such as the
UK, to block or veto measures they dislike.
The applicants want more activism on social policy and the environment and a
voting mechanism to deliver it. If the social chapter of Maastricht, from
which Britain triumphantly wrested exemption, were not in the treaty,
politicians across the spectrum in all the applicant countries say they
would be less interested in joining.
'We wouldn't dream of not accepting this (the social chapter),' says Ms Kaci
Kullmann Five, leader of Norway's conservative party. 'You will find Norway
in a group wanting more effectiveness on these kinds of concerns,' says Mrs
Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's Labour prime minister.
Enthusiasm for more majority voting extends into other sensitive areas, such
as industrial policy, which the Community now barely touches, and even into
Maastricht's common foreign and security policy (CFSP), where unanimity is
now the invariable rule.
Norway is a Nato member but its three fellow applicants are neutral states.
Nevertheless, sitting on the borders of eastern Europe, with the relative
certainties of the cold war now gone, all four have high hopes for the
embryonic CFSP.
'Our position would be for majority voting' in foreign policy 'if you want
to become an organisation that can act', says Ms Helga Hernes, Norway's
minister for Europe.
Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, trade minister and chief Norwegian negotiator,
specifies that 'majority voting should inform policy on issues like
Yugoslavia', on which the EC's record is not widely admired among the
applicants.
Austrian and Finnish officials say they have no problem with majority voting
within the CFSP. Sweden is more cautious, according to Mr Lars Anell, its
ambassador to the EC, but would favour 'stepping aside to let others go
ahead' where it was outvoted.
In contrast with the UK and Denmark, all four are keen (and plausible)
applicants for economic and monetary union later in the century. They feel
that the mangling of the Finnish mark and Swedish krona in the backwash of
last autumn's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism makes an even
stronger case for fixed exchange rates.
The entry of the four should also greatly strengthen the free trade wing of
the EC, curbing the protectionist tendencies often associated with France.
The Scandinavians would, in addition, help open up more EC decision-making
to public scrutiny, eroding the secretive habits derived from British,
German and French practice.
The four, in sum, would not fit into any existing voting alliance on EC
policy. But, by the same token, they are not likely to provide decisive
reinforcements against federalism - as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
suggested they would, in a recent interview with the FT.
'If that's the way they (the British government) think it is, they're in for
a big shock,' said a senior EC official closely involved in the
negotiations.
'We will fight for a more federalist Europe, naturally,' Mr Hans Brunmayr,
deputy chief of the Austrian mission in Brussels which is leading Vienna's
negotiations, observes more prosaically.
But they are not in the Community yet. All four say they are ready to comply
with the 12's injunction that they must accept not only existing EC law, but
all of Maastricht too, without Danish or British-style opt-outs. Yet they
warn that unless the EC accommodates a range of national interests and
cultural differences, entry is impossible. The most problematic policy areas
are:
Agriculture. Some 60 officials in Brussels are already ploughing through 500
pages of Austrian position papers seeking privileged treatment for its
Alpine farmers. That should be easy in comparison to the treatment the three
Nordic applicants insist on for their Arctic farmers. Farm subsidies per
capita in the four are up to twice the already high EC average. If the EC
farm regime is complex and wasteful now, even after last year's reform,
extending it from the Mediterranean to the Arctic sea is the stuff of
nightmares.
The Scandinavians say high subsidies to farmers are needed to keep people in
their thinly populated northern territories, along with lavish regional
grants. 'It is compulsory for us to get a solution,' says Mr Heikki
Haavisto, the farmers' leader and Euro-sceptic who Finland last month
appointed as foreign minister to stand as guarantor in what it regards as
the decisive issue of the negotiations.
For Norway, retaining control of its rich fisheries resources is also
decisive. 'The question of fish will determine the referendum,' says Mr Jan
Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister and another of the previously anti-EC
figures which the applicants have thrust into the front line of
negotiations. 'We have no fish to give away,' he adds bluntly.
Environment. All the applicants fear the EC will erode their generally
higher environmental standards, by insisting that these constitute barriers
to free trade in the EC's single market. Sweden, for instance, is unlikely
to win agreement on all its higher standards on vehicle emissions and
safety.
A senior Brussels official rates the 'green' issue as much worse than
adjusting to Spain and Portugal's economic problems, the crux of the last
enlargement negotiations. 'It will be a major challenge to show that they're
improving their lot,' he says. 'If we don't, public opinion will see it as
vandalising their quality of life.'
Energy. Norway reserves half of all exploration rights to its rich oil and
gas reserves for its state oil company, Statoil. Draft EC legislation, due
to be discussed by the 12 this month, would outlaw such preferences as
discriminatory. Oslo wants any decision shelved until Norway enters the EC,
and says this measure alone could decide whether that happens. But Germany
looks as though it will champion a postponement.
Money. This issue will rear its ugly head at the final stage of
negotiations. Overall, the four are richer per capita than the 12, and will
be substantial net contributors to the EC budget. Spain, as ever, will want
more, but the real problem will arise if the Scandinavians seek to offset
too much farm spending against their budget contributions, or to phase these
in.
If all these hurdles are cleared, the Efta four will then step into the
political minefields of defence and the reform of EC decision-making. The
shape of common European defence arrangements, which Maastricht alludes to,
is still a matter of fierce debate in the Community. Yet federalist
countries such as Belgium, which will assume the EC presidency in July, want
commitments from the four now to an eventual common defence policy.
'Before giving answers, we should know the real questions,' says Mr Pertti
Salolainen, trade minister and chief negotiator for Finland, which along
with Austria has said it wants to be part of a future European security
system.
The main concern among the neutrals, as summed up by Mr Jaakko Iloniemi,
head of the pro-EC Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies, is the
vagueness of EC defence plans. 'Are we going to give up a tried policy (of
neutrality) for a series of half-baked guarantees?' he asks.
Institutional reform, to adapt the EC's creaking decision-making machinery
to a possible doubling of Community membership once eastern Europe is
embraced early next century, has officially been shelved until the 1996
constitutional review fixed by Maastricht. The EC's formal line is that no
more than technical adjustments are needed to fit in the Efta four.
Yet already the intra-EC factions are staking out their positions for 1996,
and this is unnerving the applicants. The four seem likely to become
entangled in the emerging struggle over whether to lower the threshold
required for decision-taking under the EC's weighted majority voting, as
part of this enlargement.
Federalist countries want a lower threshold, making it harder for countries
such as the UK to block decisions. The applicants' primary concern is to get
enough voting weight in the new arrangement. But they must, above all, be
able to demonstrate to their peoples that whatever is agreed will work in
the interests of small to medium-sized member states. Fear of being
submerged by their bigger partners was one reason Danes voted no to
Maastricht a year ago.
Already the prospect of enlargement shows signs of leading to a strengthened
Franco-German alliance - the main axis of the EC - and possibly even a
closer relationship between these two and the UK, completing a 'big three'.
The smaller member states are ever vigilant on changes in the EC's delicate
balance of power. They see the Commission as a shield for their interests,
and last autumn they rallied to defend Brussels when the big countries
wanted a big roll-back of its powers, in the name of subsidiarity.
The Efta four are acutely sensitive about sovereignty and their
vulnerability as small states. Yet they appear prepared to check their
national vetoes at the door if they get the right terms to enter the EC.
That is why their terms are high, and getting all four in is no foregone
conclusion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When his days of driving up and down the M4 in pursuit of a political career
are done, Rhodri Morgan should apply to be a headline writer.
The Labour MP for Cardiff West called Observer yesterday to leak a secret
about the Llangollen conference centre, where in a few hours from now
Premier Major is set to address whatever may be left of the Conservative
party in Wales.
Having heard that the venue had too few if any toilets, Morgan suggested
that the lack was worth reporting under the headline: 'Major meets his
Port-a-loo'.
Nice one, Rhodri . . . but it isn't true alas.
Llangollen's newly built Royal International Pavilion pulled the plug on the
tale by saying that, besides having enough conference space for unlimited
verbal outpourings, it has physical facilities sufficient for an attendance
of 16,000 at least.
So whatever the prime minister's effect on the 800 or so Welsh Tories
expected, the drains should be able to cope.

The City is full of strange bed-fellows. So perhaps it's unfair to highlight
the irony in the move by Thatcherite David Pascall, a former member of the
Number 10 policy unit, to work for Lord Hollick, founder of the leftish
leaning Institute for Public Policy Research.
Pascall - who has been made an offer he couldn't refuse from Hollick's MAI -
brushes political differences aside, calling his new boss 'first and
foremost a professional businessman'.
Perhaps even more intriguing is what Pascall, former chairman of the
National Curriculum Council, will make of the language on MAI's dealing
floor.
During his campaign to raise the standards of spoken English, it emerged
that he was deeply offended at the 'sloppy talk' of children's TV

Has anyone else noticed a point that the stock market appears to have
overlooked in its generally enthusiastic response to George Wimpey's first
ever rights issue?
Sir John Quinton had been chairman of Barclays Bank for only nine months
when he stunned the market by launching a Pounds 920m rights issue in early
1988, and we all know what happened after that. Now, six months after
Quinton took the chair at Wimpey, it is asking its shareholders for money.
No doubt it is all for a jolly good cause. But when it comes to losing other
people's money and replenishing it with rights issues, Britain's bankers are
in a class of their own.

Sounds as if the World Bank has finally found a chief economist to fill the
gap left by Larry Summers who quit many months ago to be under-secretary of
state for international affairs at the US Treasury.
Michael Bruno, the former governor of the Bank of Israel, is expected to
step up to the plate next week.
Bruno had been offered the World Bank job back in February but turned it
down in favour of a similar post at Jacques Attali's European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, saying he wanted to be closer to his home
and family in Jerusalem. Then he backed off EBRD because he was unhappy with
the EBRD's staffing and budgetary constraints. He stresses that it had
nothing to do with Attali.
In going to Washington he follows a fairly well-worn path. Jacob Frenkel,
former chief economist at the IMF, replaced Bruno as head of the Israeli
central bank.
Moreover Stanley Fischer, who was Larry Summer's predecessor at the World
Bank, has taught at Jerusalem's Hebrew University where Bruno is currently
Melchior Professor of International Economic Policy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the Hawaiians' Aloha, Tahiti's Ia Ora is a salutation that can stand
for both 'hello' and 'goodbye'. But it can hardly mean 'welcome' as the
Pacific islanders say it to the latest newcomer - income tax.
Whether the innovation means goodbye to Tahiti's claims to be an earthly
paradise is open to question. It would certainly be denied by the government
of French Polynesia, whose excuse is that the tax is needed to supply a
social welfare system and more decent roads, housing and healthcare.
Besides, the government says, the tax won't be levied on incomes below about
Pounds 7,900, and even above that the rate will be only 3 per cent. But
isn't that a figure we've heard somewhere before?
Well, almost - because it was at the rate of 2.9 per cent that income tax
was first imposed as a peacetime measure in Britain in 1842. Of course, as
prime minister Sir Robert Peel pledged at the time, it was to last at most
three years . . .

<TEXT>
IF NOTHING else, the voters in Los Angeles have taken a fair-sized leap in
the dark by electing Mr Richard Riordan as mayor. He may have carried the
Republican law and order banner, but he is a virtual political novice. His
promise, like that of Mr Ross Perot, is that this very lack of conventional
experience at least gives him a chance to try to apply so far largely
untested, business-like solutions to the city's problems.
There could be easier inner-city laboratories. Last year's riots
demonstrated the extent of urban decay and attendant social and racial
divisions. The Rebuild LA project, the business-led effort directed until
recently by Mr Peter Ueberroth, has made only modest progress. The city's
government, designed for a simpler age, is antiquated, an agglomeration of
fiefdoms, such as the police force, over which the mayor often can exercise
only minimal control. Even Tom Bradley, an artist at consensus for 20 years
at City Hall, used to complain that his writ did not run far.
But the problems of Los Angeles are still mostly different only in magnitude
and complexity from those of other cities. Their collective plight is not
short of analysis or advocacy. President Bill Clinton was the latest to
weigh in, with a speech singling out for equal criticism his own Democratic
party's addiction to the existing social welfare system and the Republican
determination to starve the inner cities of the resources for recovery. Both
are, indeed, salient features of their difficulties.
Yet, as the Rev Martin Luther King was fond of saying, there can be 'a
paralysis of analysis'. President Clinton's actions have so far been less
impressive than his diagnostic rhetoric. Most of his proposals - some
'empowerment' zones, some summer jobs money, some innovative housing
projects, a limited national service corps, greater police funding, a push
for modest gun control - are both small scale and long term. Meanwhile the
private sector, with not enough exceptions, steers clear of the inner
cities' needs, which do not square with the macro-imperative of reducing the
national budget deficit.
Absent federal assistance on a grand scale and with state resources (most
painfully in California) equally strained, a particular burden does fall on
local initiative. To his credit, Mr Clinton is inclined to encourage this,
supporting, for example, state reforms of Medicaid, the costly federal-state
health programme for the elderly. Local officials insist they have greater
flexibility under his administration than under previous federal
governments, Republican and Democratic.
Whether Mayor Riordan can avail himself of this licence by pursuing
innovative programmes remains to be seen. What he would like, as would any
other mayor, is a substantial economic recovery, but that, too, cannot be
promised. And this is but the start of another long, hot summer.

THE CURSE of British industry, it would appear, is complacency. According to
an IBM study published earlier this week, the great majority of British
manufacturers believe themselves to be internationally competitive. In fact,
only a tiny proportion of their plants operate to the highest world
standards. The issue of competitiveness has preoccupied the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry for the past
year and more. Assuming the IBM picture is broadly correct - and there is
anecdotal evidence to support it - why have these august bodies not made the
fact known?
The answer is sadly obvious. The DTI has prepared an analysis of Britain's
competitive position. But the results are uncomfortable, and thus cannot be
published. Similarly, the CBI's National Manufacturing Council has devoted
itself, since its inception 18 months ago, to identifying areas of weakness
and inculcating best practice. But the CBI's main job is to represent
British industry to the outside world. It cannot be expected to publish a
blunt picture of industry's failings.
IBM's position is very different. Its survey is a first stab at entering the
management consultancy market, and by publishing its results it hopes to
drum up custom. That does not invalidate the findings. Though the study is
not exhaustive, its methodology seems objective enough: to assess some 200
plants on an index of performance, based on an analysis of best
manufacturing practice in the US and Japan. Subsequent examination suggests
that plants at the top of the sample had profit margins some 10 percentage
points higher than those at the bottom. The study's definition of 'world
class' - a score of over 80 per cent on the index - is arbitrary. But there
seems no reason to doubt the conclusion that Britain is lagging badly
behind.
Such findings are depressing only if they are not acted upon. The study
suggests, for example, that one of the strongest influences on manufacturing
performance is the quality of the customer. The food manufacturing industry
scores high, because of the standards imposed by retailers such as Sainsbury
and Tesco. So do suppliers to the computer industry. Suppliers to government
departments score below average. This lends force to a familiar notion: that
one of the most basic objectives of industrial policy should be for the
government to be a professional buyer.
Another conclusion for government is similarly basic. The complacency of
British industry may often be a case of honest ignorance. As the CBI itself
has been heard to remark, there are too many companies in Britain believing
themselves to be Olympic class when their true standard is that of the
village green. Pointing out the discrepancy, however brusquely, is a
necessary preliminary to setting it right. If the DTI has the information,
it should publish it as widely as possible.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Leading Article: The cost of fighting Aids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ITS 14,000 delegates, ranging from scientists and pharmaceutical
salesmen to gay activists and Africans in tribal robes, this week's Ninth
International Aids Conference in Berlin offers a fat target to critics of
the travelling 'Aids circus'. It certainly encourages some to take the view
that people who make a living out of Aids have exaggerated its threat to the
world's health, in order to frighten governments into giving them more
money.
But the overwhelming view of the international scientific and medical
communities, including those not directly involved in Aids research or care,
is that too little is spent on the disease. Although HIV may not be
infecting heterosexuals in developed countries as quickly as some
epidemiologists predicted five years ago, the ingredients are still in place
for an epidemic to spread slowly through Europe and north America over the
next decade or two. There is already a full-scale Aids epidemic in
sub-Saharan Africa (claims to the contrary are simply wrong) and soon there
will probably be one in southern Asia.
The world now spends roughly as much on Aids research as it does on cancer
or heart disease - about Pounds 2bn a year. Of this about two-thirds comes
from governments and the remainder from the pharmaceutical industry.
Rigorous control and co-ordination of such rapidly mobilised programmes
always presents difficulties. It may also seem a lot to spend on a disease
that has so far infected 'only' 14m people worldwide and killed 2.5m
altogether. Its toll is still much smaller than heart disease and cancer in
industrialised countries or tuberculosis and malaria in the third world.
But Aids requires a special effort because it is new and unpredictable and
is increasing far more rapidly than established killer diseases.
Conservative forecasts suggest a doubling of victims by the end of the
decade. The nightmare scenario is that the fast-changing virus might mutate
into a significantly more infectious strain.
To those infected with HIV, research appears to make agonisingly slow
progress. Sometimes it may even seem to move backwards, as for example when
the Concorde clinical trial revealed the deficiencies of AZT. But the Berlin
conference shows that real advances are being made. Eventually science
should give doctors vaccines to prevent HIV infection and drugs to control
the disease in those who are already infected. A valuable spin-off will be
much new knowledge of virology and immunology that can be used to fight
other diseases or even to understand basic processes such as ageing.
Nor should it be forgotten that the world knows how to stop Aids spreading:
to discourage unprotected sex between strangers and the sharing by drug
users of needles, and to screen public blood supplies for HIV. Support for
Aids prevention programmes in developing countries is another genuinely high
priority.

Sir, Of course, I would never want to be accused of placing facts in the way
of a good story, but Observer ('Loosening up', June 8) has translated an
Afrikaans/Dutch word incorrectly. Actually, the anecdote is even better with
the correct translation.
Buitenverwachting - the wine served by the ANC newspaper, New Nation, when
Roelf Meyer, the government negotiator, and ANC secretary-general Cyril
Ramaphosa jointly accepted the 'man of the year award' - actually means
'beyond expectations', and not 'waiting outside'. In contrast with
Allesverloren (all is lost), the wine served to Meyer shortly after
President De Klerk's 1990 speech un-banning the ANC, it would seem the talks
are going better than some fear.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Little light at tunnel's end: The outlook for British Coal
is looking grimmer by the month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The warning from Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, was less than
explicit when it finally came, spoken almost as an aside. But there was no
doubt about the meaning.
He had just received an unenthusiastic reception at the annual conference of
the Union of Democratic Mineworkers after telling delegates that half the
company's 6,000 white collar workers were no longer required.
Then came the crunch. 'Unless we are more competitive, the consequence will
effectively be the closure of more pits,' he said.
Last October, the government said that, of Britain's 50 remaining pits, it
wanted to close all but 19 because the market for coal was not big enough to
sustain them. In a white paper published in March, the government reprieved
12 of the doomed pits after a public outcry forced it to retreat. Within the
industry, however, there were strong doubts about whether these 12 pits
would stay open for long.
In raising the doubts in public, Mr Clarke finally acknowledged what others
in the industry had been saying in private for some time. His intervention
may also have been prompted by a recognition that the outlook for coal has
worsened significantly over the past few months.
As the global oversupply in coal continues to undermine the market, British
Coal's main customers - the two electricity generators, National Power and
PowerGen - are shifting increasingly to a cleaner and, they argue, cheaper,
source of energy: gas. The threat to coal from gas and also from nuclear
power is greater, and happening more quickly, Mr Clarke told the UDM, than
he had anticipated.
A new threat to the future of the coal industry has emerged in the shape of
anti-pollution measures. The government's Pollution Inspectorate has served
notice on the generators that stricter and more costly environmental
controls on coal-fired electricity generation are to be imposed by the end
of the decade.
The generators will have to fit their coal-fired plants with expensive
pollution control equipment or run them less intensively; both options are
costly and this has reinforced their decisions to build gas-fired stations.
The increased cost of pollution control is thus speeding up the so-called
'dash for gas'.
National Power, the largest UK generator, this week announced it was closing
its coal-fired Thorpe Marsh generator in Yorkshire next March with the loss
of 200 jobs. Its place will be taken eventually by gas-fired plants such as
Staythorpe, in Nottinghamshire, for which the government granted National
Power planning permission a week ago.
Nuclear power is also increasing its share of the electricity-generating
market. Last year, Nuclear Electric lifted its share from 18.5 per cent to
21.5 per cent. This could rise to 25 per cent by 1997-98 after Sizewell B
comes on stream next year.
The shift to gas and nuclear power has gradually eroded the domination of
Britain's energy market by coal. The industry that the government plans to
privatise over the next three years is tiny compared with that brought into
the state sector in 1947. Then, there were 958 pits; at the end of the
1984-85 miners' strike, 169 were left. By the end of the century, industry
observers believe, there could be fewer than 15 pits in production.
Privatisation has already started in a small way. Private operators are
being offered licences to run the 18 of the pits which British Coal has said
it no longer wants to mine itself, and is either closing or mothballing. The
signs are not encouraging.
The response from the private sector has been muted, with at least one
potential bidder, Young Group, saying it is interested in none of the pits.
The mines being offered to the private sector are after all, in British
Coal's judgment, the least productive. It is unlikely that more than six
will attract private operators.
The future for the 12 reprieved pits may be only slightly brighter. British
Coal is trying, against difficult odds, to persuade the power generators to
buy more coal. It is also looking for niche markets in the industrial and
domestic sectors, but the main opportunity for extra sales lies with the
generators.
As part of its review of the coal industry, the government pressed the
generators to buy an extra 65m tonnes over five years from April this year,
probably enough to keep open nine of the 12 reprieved pits for most of that
period. The generators resisted, but indicated they would take 40m tonnes -
perhaps enough to provide a lifeline to six of the 12 mines. Now, even that
looks optimistic.
Armed with the promise of subsidies from the government in the white paper,
British Coal offered coal at 90p to 95p a gigajoule (a measure of thermal
efficiency), less than two-thirds of production costs and two-thirds the
price received in existing contracts.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, acknowledges that the
price cut is 'designed by British Coal to be in the competitive ball park',
but he says he does not want to decide how much coal to buy until this
autumn.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive at PowerGen, is also non-commital about the
offer of a price cut. 'I would take coal tomorrow if the price was right,'
he says.
Without further pressure from the government, which owns 40 per cent of each
of the power-generating companies, PowerGen and National Power may take very
little of the extra coal needed to keep the 12 in operation. Both have
stocks to last six months and they can buy from the world market, arguably
at lower prices than the corporation has offered.
In its white paper the government said it would discuss with the generators
'as a matter of urgency' the strategic coal stocks they are legally required
to store to ensure continued electricity generation. But discussions are
still at an early stage two months later.
'The government has been all over the place on what to do about stocks,'
says one generator executive. 'But they have backed off from asking us to
increase the levels required by law.'
There is little sign the government is ready to step up pressure on the
power generators to secure more sales. Ministers appear to feel there is
less need for action as pressure from trade unions, opposition politicians
and an angry public has waned. By effectively phasing the pit closures over
a longer period than first planned, the government has managed to remove
some of the sting.
According to one generator executive, all 12 of the reprieved pits could be
closed tomorrow without sparking the backlash of last October. 'The heat is
off and they know it.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Nice, but not up to it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It is so easy to condemn,' says one of the characters in Barchester Towers.
'I know no life that must be so delicious as that of a writer for
newspapers, or a leading member of the opposition - to thunder forth
accusations against men in power; show up the worst side of everything that
is produced; to pick holes in every coat; to be ignorant, sarcastic, jocose,
moral, or supercilious; to damn with faint praise or crush with open
calumny]'
I offer this little passage from Trollope, his favourite novelist, to Mr
John Major. He may take it as an assurance that what is said about him is
nothing personal, only business. The prime minister may particularly savour
the conclusion to the above-quoted paragraph, which I am sure he knows well:
'What can be so easy as this when the critic has to be responsible for
nothing? You condemn what I do; but put yourself in my position and do the
reverse, and then see if I cannot condemn you.'
Let us therefore put ourselves in Mr Major's position as his political life
hangs by a thread. Never mind the opinions of writers for newspapers,
consider those of his opponents, on both sides of the House. The leader of
the official opposition was at his most jocose, moral, supercilious, etc,
when he spoke on Wednesday. 'No amount of reshuffling, repackaging or
re-presentation,' thundered Mr John Smith, who rose with ease to a delicious
opportunity, 'can now disguise from the British people the stark reality of
a discredited government, presided over by a discredited prime minister.'
This was harmless compared with the publicly spoken words of the former
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont. He charged that the cabinet, of which he was
in the immediate past a member, was in office but not in power; that the
government that he had served with such limpet-like devotion for the
preceding 2 1/2 years deserved to lose.
Mr Lamont's strictures are as nothing to the calumnies whispered, not in the
open, but behind sleeves among Conservatives everywhere. The kindest summary
of these is that Mr Major may be a nice enough chap, but he is simply not up
to the job.
There is a defence to this charge, which Mr Major doubtless clings to. It is
that he is the victim of the recession, and Maastricht. This is the tale
told by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, who
claims to view the scene with some detachment. His perspective is that of an
old sweat who has seen it all. He argues with a skill that only he can
muster that many heads of government, or of state, are in difficulties not
unlike those of the British prime minister. He cites France, Germany, Spain,
Japan, the United States and others as countries struck by recession and in
consequence discontented with their political leaders.
Up to a point, Mr President. Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, brought his
troubles upon himself by promising what could not be delivered after
unification. Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, nearly lost the recent
election, but actually won. President Bill Clinton's difficulties are the
product of his eclectic campaign and his butterfly personality. Special, and
different, factors apply in France and Japan. In short, the recession is
buffeting governments, but it is not the complete explanation for voters'
revolts.
The Maastricht excuse is no more convincing. The anti-Europe vote on the
Conservative benches is larger than the government's overall majority, which
stands at 18 and shrinking. As Mr Major protested in his ashen-faced defence
of himself on Wednesday, 'dealing with the problems of a small majority is a
fundamental fact of democracy that no one dare or should even attempt to
overlook'. This will continue to be true, only more so, as the years until
the next general election go by and successive by-elections are lost. The
end of Maastricht makes no difference. Europhobes who have so bitterly
opposed Mr Major over the ratification of the treaty will not become
quiescent once it becomes law. The evolution of the European Community, or
union, is a continuing process. It will always cause ripples in British
political life.
The prime minister can, and does, give himself credit for having stuck to an
anti-inflationary policy, even when it has clearly been to his political
disadvantage to do so. He also congratulates himself for negotiating the
deal he did at Maastricht, and for sticking out the painful parliamentary
process necessary for ratification. That too has cost him dear. If he were
now to turn on his critics - those within his own party - he could find
plenty in them to condemn. It was he who won the election for their party,
he might say, deftly avoiding the greater truth that it was Labour that lost
it. All Tory MPs fought on Mr Major's manifesto, he might again remind them;
surely they should have the decency, and the loyalty, to support his
government now?
It will not wash. The question of the hour is whether once all the excuses
and explanations have been digested - the recession, the small majority,
Maastricht - we have in Mr Major a prime minister of such extraordinary
ability that he can master and reunite his party, restore the government's
authority, and carry through the painful decisions that must be made if the
Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is to be halved, and then
quartered.
The prime minister need not listen to newspaper critics' answers to this
question. As Trollope noted, it is no trouble to us to write another article
next week giving the opposite point of view from the one expressed this
week. He need not even pay excessive heed to the irreconcilables in his
party; after all, they will not bear him.
He must, however, take to heart the critics in every bar, and around every
dinner-table, in the land. They are saying now - they said at Newbury and
may say again at Christchurch - that he does not possess the heroic stature
necessary for the task before him. I express the general opinion as gently
as I can.
When the recession is behind us, will Mr Major be better able to explain his
policies? When Maastricht is gone, will he find the nerve to take a stand at
a fixed point within the Conservative party and fight off all challenges to
it? Will this prime minister ever give the country a sense that he knows
where he is taking it? If he does not, or cannot, he will go.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Institutions should help more to curb executive pay
excesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVAN K COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As always, I found Barry Riley's article on executive pay and corporate
governance ('When the brass is greener', June 5/6) both entertaining and
informative. While he argues that executive pay excesses are due to the
opportunities afforded by the increasingly confused roles of 'proprietor'
and 'manager', especially on the part of non-executive directors, I would
also argue strongly in favour of another of his insights, which he might
have taken further. That is, that the opportunities for excessive executive
pay have come about because of the 'hands off' approach taken by
institutional investors.
I contend that, were institutional investors made more accountable to their
membership, then we would find directors becoming more accountable to their
shareholders. It is the problems of institutional investor governance that
have led to problems of corporate governance. The solutions are more clearly
in the hands of the Goode Committee (pension law review) than the Cadbury
Committee.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Plea bargaining dangerously tempting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Mason, in his article 'Haggling a discount on criminal justice'
(June 8), is correct in highlighting the danger of defendants being
pressured into pleading guilty should a formal system of plea bargaining be
introduced into the English criminal justice system.
The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice should resist making such a
recommendation at least until the Serious Fraud Office wins greater,
widespread confidence in its handling of cases and its identification of
what constitutes criminal action.
I write as one of seven defendants in the Blue Arrow trial. Each of us
believed that we were innocent of any criminal action and were eventually
vindicated by the courts. Nonetheless, at the beginning of the trial in
November 1990, certain vague plea-bargaining proposals were discussed
between defendants, their counsel and prosecuting counsel. Fortunately they
came to nothing.
Consider our position though: we had been arrested in November 1989, the
scope of the prosecution allegations was such that the trial was likely to
run into the autumn of 1991 (in fact, it ran until February 1992), and the
complexity of the case (at times seemingly beyond the grasp of the
prosecution) ran the risk that the final verdict would be a lottery.
The effect of the trial on ourselves and our families made the short-cut
tempting. Had we also been responsible for our own costs, the choice would
have been all the harder. I would not have wished that temptation to have
been set in the context of a formal plea-bargaining system.
Until the SFO demonstrates both a better judgment in bringing cases to court
and a determination to keep trials down to a sensible length, the dangers of
a formal plea-bargaining system should outweigh its largely economic
attraction.

<TEXT>
Once again, in your article 'Losing lots of layers' (June 8) on the
reshaping of National Westminster Bank, we witness Britain's implicit
disdain for so-called 'soft', as against 'hard', factors when it states:
'While some of these are 'soft' measures, others such as asset quality will
be reflected directly in the profit and loss account in future years.' How
long will it be before these 'soft' measures - quality of service, customer
satisfaction, staff motivation - are recognised to be not just namby-pamby
enthusiasms, but crucial factors which will impact on 'the profit and loss
account in future years' at least as much as hard ones?

<TEXT>
Sir, From reading your article on the US-Japan semiconductor agreement ('US
may alter line on chip market share', June 7) your readers might be led to
believe the US semiconductor industry is so satisfied with the progress
being made on market access in Japan that we are willing to declare victory
and go home. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
We must build on the accomplishment of the 20 per cent foreign market share,
an achievement that has taken seven years and two trade agreements. We
support US trade representative Mickey Kantor's position that, with steady
progress, an average 20 per cent foreign market share during 1993 is an
appropriate minimum measure of further progress.
In addition, the US semiconductor industry supports the Clinton
administration's results-oriented trade policy toward Japan. In the case of
semiconductor trade, a quantitative yardstick for measuring progress and
strong government and industry co-operation, along with the industry's
commitment to serving the Japanese market, have been essential to the
increased market share that has been achieved in Japan.
We will continue to pursue the programme of the past seven years which
focuses on increased market share in Japan consistent with our demonstrated
competitiveness in world markets. At a time when American semiconductor
manufacturers' market share outside Japan is greater than 56 per cent, it is
clear that more progress must be made before the Japanese market can truly
be considered to operate solely on free market principles.
There should be no misunderstanding regarding the resolve to gain greater
access to Japan's semiconductor market. There should also be no mistaking
our willingness to work in partnership with the US government and to seek
whatever actions may be needed to ensure continued progress.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER CATO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to reassure Gideon Nellen (Letters, June 9) that BAA has
no intention of increasing retailing at the expense of other passenger
services. New retail areas are strategically and sensitively developed to
ensure extra passenger space and seating are introduced at the same time.
In the last year, Terminal 1's departure lounge at Heathrow has had 350
extra seats introduced in a 10,000 square feet extension, with only 2,000
square feet devoted to retailing.
Although customer satisfaction has increased, we are now investing in a
Pounds 65m project which will include a large extension to the Terminal 1
international departures area. We are enlarging the security check area,
installing a further 550 seats, and creating an eating and shopping complex.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Sheep invade the City - Lynn MacRitchie takes her time
to follow the sculpture trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London is blossoming with sculpture in the sudden summer heat. With new
permanent exhibits and temporary shows, from the Limehouse Link to Chelsea
Harbour, residents and visitors alike have an opportunity to compare the
City's established monuments with some sometimes startling newcomers.
Perhaps the most imaginative exhibition is Art in the City, a sculpture
trail, beginning and ending at the Barbican, initiated by independent
curator Victoria Preston.
The trail links 17 locations throughout the Square Mile where specially
chosen sculptures are sited until late July. Those intending to follow it in
full would be advised to do so in easy stages. Conducted walks are being
taken from the Barbican, estimated to last about one and a half hours, but I
found several attempts necessary to get the most out of the fascinating
walk, since finding oneself lost in an historic alley way or hidden garden
square is all part of the fun.
The workers around Finsbury Circus already seem quite at home with the flock
of sheep by Sophie Ryder now encamped there, looking thoughtfully towards
the emerald expanse of the bowling green. Sheep were being used as sun
shades and handy jacket pegs during my lunchtime visit, one young man
absentmindedly stroking one of the flock's ears as he chatted with a friend.
This is exactly the sort of response Victoria Preston welcomes, steering
sponsors to a choice of work with ready appeal, whether through reputation -
the well sited Henry Moore outside the Guildhall, a Nigel Hall looking as if
it had been there forever in Devonshire Square - or accessibility, such as
the splendid whispering girls by Andre Wallace outside Fenchurch Street
Station, or (an organisational triumph this) a Barry Flanagan cricketing
hare outside the Bank of England, which austere establishment informed Ms
Preston on her first approach that it 'hadn't bought any sculpture since
1674 . . .'
The trail also offers the opportunity to see three artists at work. Until
the end of next week Paula Haughney is to be found by the main entrance to
Liverpool Street Station, finishing off 'Small Passenger,' a carving in
limestone - 'like St Paul's', she told me - of 'a woolly beast with a baby
on her back.' The watchful beast has curving horns and would have fangs 'if
her mouth was open.' The small human child sleeps peacefully, comfortably
cradled on the beast's rough coat.
It is a charming piece of work and the opportunity to see how it is done was
being taken happily by a seated audience lunching outside McDonald's. The
braver souls spoke to Paula and asked all those sorts of questions - what is
it, how did you do it, how much does it cost - that everyone always wants to
ask but normally cannot. For the artist, it provides a welcome break from
studio isolation and a chance for some peer group praise - workers from
nearby construction sites had been particularly appreciative of the skill
and sheer hard work that stone carving entails.
On the blighted expanse of Paternoster Square the duo Clark/MacGregor are
constructing something very different.
During the next week, a huge clay head and hand will rise from the patio,
evoking all sorts of associations with the deserted surroundings. Is the
figure sinking or rising up, newly destroyed or newly created, its hand
raised in greeting or goodbye? Clark/MacGregor (two graduates of the Slade)
worked together in video and performance before their present engagement
with large scale outdoor sculpture. During a similar project in Greenwich,
they were 'shocked' at the public reaction.
Expecting the worst, I looked concerned. 'No, no,' they told me, 'people
were really positive, they liked the work and thought it should be there
permanently . . .'
Reasons of size and cost mean that they confine themselves to cheap
materials such as plaster and lathing, a tactic which enables them to work
on the grand scale they desire and see their schemes realised, however
briefly, without the endless negotiations siting such work permanently would
entail. They welcomed the Art in the City initiative as an opportunity to
explore ideas in conjunction with the audience they wish to address - the
general public rather than the gallery circuit.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Graves's 'Carmen' - Maggio musicale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though she has been singing Carmen for only a couple of years, the young
American mezzo Denyce Graves has staked a firm claim to the role. Her recent
appearances at the Teatro Comunale in Florence confirmed her affinity with
Bizet's heroine and, at the same time, enlivened what has been a fairly
lacklustre Maggio musicale, the 56th festival in the series.
Denyce Graves looks the part: slim and sexy, dark-skinned, she has a
dazzling, seductive smile, mobile expression (insofar as the disastrous
lighting of the production allowed her face to be seen), a feline grace, and
an impressive ability to dance.
She can sing, too. The voice is not over-opulent, but it has warmth,
extension, and a broad range of colours. At times, she can sound almost
adolescent, as she proclaims - and demonstrates - Carmen's sincerity; then,
when she asserts her need for freedom, she is commanding, even frightening.
While remaining always in the part, she never sacrifices the music to the
drama. The notes are given their proper value. After enduring far too many
'singing actresses' exaggerate chest notes and parlando, it was a welcome
relief to hear such straightforward singing.
Though Luis Lima does not have a great, or even an attractive voice, he has
understandably become the leading interpreter of Don Jose'; for his total
identification with the unhappy soldier, his intensity and - in the final
act - his crazed desperation make him entirely convincing and moving. He was
the ideal partner for Denyce Graves; it was a pity that the infelicitous
staging of Nuria Espert (imported from Covent Garden) did not fully exploit
the possibilities of the two personable and gifted stars.
When they were not obscured by Albert Faura's lighting (no, wrong word: by
his 'darkening'), the main characters were concealed in the clumsily-handled
chorus. Graves and Lima triumphed in spite of their producer. They also
received little support from their conductor. Zubin Mehta imposed an
unimaginative reading: the tempi were often rigid, Bizet's subtle shifts of
mood, the little surges of hope, the brief plunges into desperation, were
all smoothed out. Micaela's scene (Cecilia Gasdia was in poor form) dragged
on endlessly, a whining dirge. Justino Diaz has never been a really
satisfactory Escamillo, except visually; at this point in his career, he is
not enjoyable to hear.
The Mercedes and, even more, the Frasquita were simply inadequate; Morales,
Dancaire and Remendado were no better. In the delicate 'smoking' scene of
Act I (dully handled by Mehta), the thinned voices of the chorus sounded
strained. Often, in the case of Carmen we are obliged to hear an opera
without a protagonist; on this occasion, we heard a protagonist who had been
largely deprived of her opera.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: Playing with fire - Opera in Lyon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lully's Phaeton, the first opera ever to be performed at Lyons (in 1688, a
year after the composer's death) has returned there 300 years later as the
final production for the opening of the new opera house, recently described
here by Max Loppert. In Paris the first Phaeton was so successful that it
became known as 'the opera of the people' - a tribute no doubt to the
elaborate spectacle as much as to the music. Readers of Angus Wilson's last
novel Setting the world on fire may remember that this was the opera chosen
for a modern revival in the Vanbrugh Great Hall, suitably frescoed, in the
mansion Wilson imagined near Westminster Abbey.
In the unusual libretto by Quinault, a clutch of discontented royals with
divine connections intrigue and bicker. Phaeton, whose father is the Sun, is
chosen by the King of Egypt to succeed him and to wed his daughter Libye,
infuriating Epaphus, a son of Jupiter, who wants both the job and the girl.
Epaphus insinuates to Phaeton that the Sun is not really his father.
Phaeton's mother Clymene, now married to the Egyptian king, reassures him.
Phaeton, however, consumed by overwhelming longing to rule the universe,
asks his solar father for confirmation. The Sun obliges, adding a pledge to
give Phaeton anything he desires. To his father's horror the boy asks to
drive his fiery chariot across the skies. Epaphus sneaks to Jupiter, who
dispatches a thunderbolt. Phaeton falls.
The designer, Jean Bauer, frames the action in a revolving, flame-coloured
permanent set, somewhere between ochre and apricot, with fantastic costumes,
mainly yellow and gold, by Sylvie Skinazi. Sunlight, spheres, circles, hoops
everywhere. Dancers, acrobats, trapezists, a midget. For much of the time
the stage centre is occupied by a plexi-glass half-globe sometimes on the
floor, sometimes tilted or suspended. Much of the dancing took place under
the glass, hidden from me by an exceptionally tall opera-goer in the seat in
front (not typical - sight lines from the stall seem good). Karine Saporta,
producer and choreographer, is described as being 'on the cutting edge of
modern dance'. The singers were given finicky little arm and hand movements
like the Peter Sellars Zauberflote at Glyndebourne. Too much movement
altogether, to the detriment of plot and words.
I am sure that Lully, if he came back today, would make his singers dance
but I do not believe he would have blurred the distinction between singing
and dance with so much fiddle-faddle. In one dialogue two pairs of dancers
'acted out' the words with distracting effect. During Phaeton's crucial
interview with the Sun, two extras peeping through holes twiddled shaving
mirrors. Phaeton's fall was effectively suggested (Herve Audibert's lighting
was ingenious when he stopped dazzling the audience). The producer rightly
realised that the real point of interest is not the catastrophe but the
insensate pride and ambition that causes it.
I saw the second performance. There may have been too little rehearsal; not
everything on and behind stage went smoothly. After a heroic ten days or so
the company appeared understandbly tired. The singers, some of them
seemingly worried by their movements, too often failed to give Lully's
masterly recitatives their full effect - I gladly except the irrepressible
Jean-Paul Fouchecourt in three roles including the Sun. Howard Crook,
dignified as ever, took the title-role. As Libye, Veronique Gens sang
brightly. Jennifer Smith as her rival Theone, unavailingly sighing for the
unfeeling Phaeton, had some expressively turned phrases also some shrillness
at the top.
Like most operas of the period Phaeton is rich in rewarding small parts,
well taken here by, among others, Rachel Yakar, Laurent Naouri, Gerard
Theruel, Philippe Huttenlocher. The Musiciens du Louvre under Marc Minkowski
were energetic but less spick than span than usual. The Ensemble Vocal
Sagittarius provided the chorus (how artful of Lully to open his prologue
with such a ravishing piece for female voices).
The large audience was pin-still and appreciative. I did not detect any
outward sign of discontent with the much-discussed new building as they
clattered down from the upper balconies in the interval in search of
refreshment. Whatever its faults the new opera house is intensely and
enjoyably theatrical (no-one could say that about La Bastille in Paris),
even if in that theatricality there is an element of international
exhibition swank which may not last well or long.

listen to The Movie Quiz on Radio 2 (7.00) ..stick the mobile phone in your
pocket and you could even take part and win yourself a year's cinema pass

Philharmonic In Cambridge playing music by four contemporary Cambridge
composers: Alexander Goehr, Hugh Wood, Thomas Ades (who graduated from
King's last year with a double starred first) and Robin Holloway. Flick over
to Radio 4 when that ends and you will catch the final part of John

FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: 'Blithe Spirit': dated as dry martini - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noel Coward wrote Blithe Spirit during a week's holiday at Portmeirion in
May 1941. He said, 'I will admit that I knew it was witty, I knew it was
well constructed and I also knew it would be a success.' The play ran for
2,000 performances in the West End. From the stage, Margaret Rutherford and
Kay Hammond were joined by Rex Harrison for David Lean's fine 1945 film.
The play's assumptions rather than its language, have dated, especially when
they are laid bare in Mark Piper's nervy production at the Richmond Theatre,
Surrey. The play should become funnier as the actors relax, but at the
moment it falls short.
Blithe Spirit tells of a novelist, Charles, who calls in a medium, one
Madame Arcati to conduct some psychic research. She manages to materialise
his first wife, Elvira, visible and audible to him alone, and intent on
having him join her on the other side. Charles's second wife, Ruth, handles
the situation well until Elvira kills her in a car accident fixed for
Charles. He is then haunted by two ex-wives who are finally exorcised by
Madame Arcati and the Maid.
This is a comedy of perception. On stage, Coward has Charles replying to
Elvira but seeming to talk to Ruth; but the play also presents ideal
femininity in 1941: blithe, bonny, spirited and anything but flesh and bone.
It is this perception which has begun to date the play.
Literary mediums, from Robert Browning's Mr Sludge to TS Eliot's Madame
Sosostris, are rarely so terrestrial as Madame Arcati, beautifully played
here by the substantial Peggy Mount. She also carried a miscued scene when
the gramophone failed to work - 'I'll sing it then.' Geoffrey Davies as
Charles, Marsha Fitzalan as Ruth, and Louise Jameson as Elvira maintain a
quick banter and scurry round the fine drawing-room set.
Where would Coward be without the dry martini ('anyone can write a book, but
it takes an artist to mix a martini dry enough') and the place name: 'You
were feckless and irresponsible and morally unstable . . . I realised that
before we left Budleigh Salterton'?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am lonely./ My body prison./ Door I am lonely./ My body prison./ Door
closed./ Hear them/ Talk over my head/ Like vegetable./ They afraid/ To see
me out with Mum./ She hates them./ Watch them.
This poem is by Bill Robins. He is 24 years old, very severely disabled with
athetoid cerebral palsy, and he is the central and compelling figure in a
new work made for and by Amici Dance Theatre. Amici is the creation of
Wolfgang Stange, whose career has been spent in proving the therapeutic
power of dance in helping people with every physical and mental disadvantage
to explore and explain their identities in movement theatre. From their
aspirations, as from their sometimes distressing handicaps, Stange has
guided the creation of brave and challenging theatre-pieces during the past
decade - and none more so than The Journey which is at Riverside this week.
Bill Robins' condition - in the prison of his body, with a wide-ranging
intelligence - is the theme of the work, which has a scenario by Gilly
Fraser. Indomitable will can set his imagination free to explore a world and
his own hopes. He becomes, thereby, a magic shaman-figure for others,
handicapped or able-bodied, who are taught by his suffering as by his
bravery, and through his plight - and his needs - they, and we, can learn.
Stange's cast of over 40 performers are involved in simple, effective
routines. Bill Robins' journey is fantasy, but it confronts handicaps other
than his own, and makes powerful cause for the emotional (and sexual) needs
of its players. A significant extra to the presentation is the presence of
three members of Ra Ra Zoo, the acrobatic theatre troupe. Nigel Warrack,
Jeremy Robins and Lindsey Butcher can be seen as physically splendid figures
in contrast to the rest of the cast. They may be ideals; they appear,
though, as friends, guides, and - playing with great sensitivity - Miss
Lindsey becomes Bill Robins' lover. The Journey, as you may gather, is
neither mealy-mouthed nor playing for undue sympathy. It is honest in its
humour as in its sorrows.
Its boldest trick is to introduce a parallel with Giselle. One of the
characters is Jack, played with marvellous concentration by Ian Willis.
Suddenly he is revealed as a transvestite, wildly arrayed in long red dress,
pearls and white gloves. As we hear a recording of the Giselle mad-scene,
Jack becomes Giselle, tearing through the crowd of on-lookers, finally
killing himself with a drug over-dose. His wife, Mary, grieves over the
body. The ingredients seem preposterous; the performance - with an implicit
comment upon the reasons for Jack's madness - is heart-tearing. Even more so
a later parallel with the last moments of the ballet.
We have seen that Bill Robins' character is loved by Lindsey Butcher. As the
music for Giselle and Albrecht's last farewell rings out, Robins and Lindsey
Butcher are carried in on the shoulders of Nigel Warrack and Jeremy Robins,
to meet briefly, clasp at each other, and then be separated. The effect is
truer in feeling, more vivid, than the ending of most stagings of Giselle we
sit through today. And, as an historical quirk, let me record that it was
from these Riverside Studios in 1958 that BBCTV transmitted Margaret Dale's
celebrated production of Giselle, with Nadia Nerina and Nikolay Fadeyechev.
Thirty-five years later, the immediacy of emotion which marked that superb
performance was to be seen in Amici's playing.
Amici represents something of huge value: art as understanding. One might go
a long way to find an enterprise odder than The Journey. One could travel
even further to find something as inspiring. To everyone connected with
Amici and this performance, admiration. Amici is part of the Hammersmith
Community Education programme. Further support came from London Arts Board,
Allied Irish Bank, Harper Collins.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology: Green hue on screen - Moves to recycle PCs and
make them energy efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Users of personal computers in the US may soon be able to recycle their old
machines and buy new systems that use less energy. It is all part of a
growing trend in PC markets to make computers more 'green' by reducing their
energy consumption and finding ways of recycling them.
With PC product cycles running at less than six months, there is a growing
problem over what to do with large numbers of obsolescent computers. A
recent study by the Carnegie-Mellon university estimates that more than 150m
PCs will be dumped in US landfills by the year 2005, with disposal costs
reaching Dollars 1bn (Pounds 662m). In the UK, the Industry Council for
Electronic and Electrical Equipment predicts that more than 800,000 PCs will
be thrown away by 1995.
The American Plastics Council, which represents 23 leading plastics
manufacturers, has launched a pilot project to investigate the recovery and
recycling of plastic materials from computer and business equipment. Old PCs
are being collected from Apple Computer, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and
Xerox.
Terry Mohoruk, chairman of the APC's Computer and Business Equipment Group
and manager of vinyl recycling at Geon plastics, will supervise the project
which will initially search for the best way to shred and hammer computer
enclosures into pieces. 'Our goal is to avoid costly and inefficient manual
disassembly of components,' he says. The recovered plastic will be used
either in making new computers or as fill in other products.
The APC is also preparing a design guide to help PC producers create
products that can be more easily recycled. It is also working on a single
standard for a plastic made mostly of recycled plastic. IBM already has
plans to introduce PC models this summer that will contain plastics
containing a blend of recycled and virgin resins.
PC designers are also trying to extend the useful life of computers by
adopting modular designs. These allow users to upgrade their systems to
faster microprocessors or larger hard drives by simply removing one
component and retaining the rest of the system.
For example, Intel, the chip manufacturer, is working with PC manufacturers
to provide special 'overdrive' sockets that will allow buyers of the
company's Pentium-based systems to upgrade their systems by simply inserting
a newer, faster microprocessor.
As part of this trend, PC manufacturers are working to produce systems that
use much less power. When idle, these desktop PCs will automatically shut
down almost all functions but can be instantly awakened from the 'sleep'
mode.
President Bill Clinton's recent executive order, that the US government
should buy energy-efficient computers complying with the Environmental
Protection Agency's Energy Star Program, will help increase demand for what
are becoming known as 'green PCs'. The US government is the world's largest
buyer of computer equipment and use of energy-efficient PCs could save it
more than Dollars 40m a year in electricity costs.
The EPA estimates that if PC users in the US adopt low-consumption systems,
by 2000 they will save Dollars 2bn a year in electricity costs and prevent
pollution equivalent to that produced by 5m cars.
With the US government driving this nascent market, large US corporations
say they may adopt a similar purchasing policy. San Francisco-based
BankAmerica Systems Engineering division has more than 25,000 PCs. It says
it would be interested in buying such systems if they met its
specifications. Dataquest, the market research company, is soon to finish a
study of green PC markets and predicts that by 1997 almost all PCs will
conform to the EPA's Energy Star specifications. These permit a maximum of
30W energy consumption in 'sleep' mode for the main system, and 30W for the
monitor. Most desktop PCs now use about 200W, with monitors consuming about
half that.
Robert Corpuz, PC industry analyst at Dataquest, says: 'We've had
microprocessor wars with manufacturers claiming ever faster systems. Now
we'll probably have wattage wars with Dell and Compaq fighting over (who
has) the lowest power consumption.
'We see a huge market potential for companies that will produce products
that can convert current PC systems to the EPA specifications - especially
in the corporate market where energy savings of more than Dollars 100 per PC
per year add up to huge savings. A key factor in the success of 'green' PCs
will be to keep prices the same and make sure there is no reduction in
performance.'
So far, US manufacturers of PCs say that buyers of green PCs will not be
asked to pay extra money. Acer America claims to be the first on the market
with its AcerPAC 250 PC which uses only 10W in rest mode. Similar systems
will be available later this year from IBM, Apple and other PC makers.
Apple has set up the Sustainable Technologies Group as part of its research
and development division. Apple says it is studying ways of lessening the
environmental impact of computers and developing new kinds of
energy-efficient technologies which could eventually give it an edge in the
highly competitive PC market.
Most of the technologies that will be used in building energy-efficient PCs
already exist. They were developed for portable computers where the
limitations of batteries have made energy conservation vital. All portables
have a 'sleep' mode that conserves battery power by partially shutting the
system after a few minutes of idle time. Some slow the main processor
between keystrokes for fractions of a second.
Another technology is the production of 3.3 volt semiconductors and built-in
power management features such as those that will be found in almost all
Intel microprocessors.
Dataquest says the green PC trend will spread. Offices will have 'green' fax
machines, copiers and laser printers. Most laser printer manufacturers
already offer recycling programmes for printer cartridges.
As PCs continue to replace mainframes, the recycling of old mainframes
becomes a problem. Amdahl, a manufacturer of IBM plug-compatible mainframes,
says its old mainframes generally get resold on the used computer market.
Within the US government, agencies hand them on to other agencies. Some have
even ended up in China.
But old mainframes do have some salvage value. Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory recently sold an old Cray 1 computer to two speculators. The
supercomputer was valued at Dollars 19m when purchased in 1976, but Tony
Cole and Saber Shehadeh paid a 'binary' Dollars 10,101.01 at a government
auction.
They hope someone might buy the old colossus for historic reasons. 'If we
can't sell it we'll scrap it,' says Shehadeh. 'There's at least Dollars
20,000 of gold in it plus a lot of copper.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Technology: Safer HIV testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Testing for HIV, the virus that causes Aids, can be a hazardous business. At
least 155 health workers are reported to have been infected by the virus
through needlestick injuries while taking blood from HIV-positive patients.
The true number is probably higher, given poor training standards in many
developing countries.
However, a number of companies are developing a method of testing for HIV
using saliva rather than blood. At the Berlin Aids conference this week,
Saliva Diagnostics Systems, a Washington State-based group, revealed a
saliva collection technique.
A sterile cotton pad is placed in the mouth and left there for five minutes.
This is then placed into a collection device for later analysis. The saliva
stays stable for up to 21 days at 37`C and unlike blood does not require
refrigeration. The device is sold or under evaluation in more than 70
countries. About 200,000 have been sold in Thailand.
The company claims there is no risk to either patient or health worker
collecting saliva samples. This is because although saliva contains
HIV-antibodies, it contains little, if any, active virus. Trials have shown
that although there are lower concentrations of antibody in saliva than
blood, the testing techniques allow scientists to identify nearly all
HIV-positive samples.
Dr Carol Major, head of HIV surveillance at the Ontario ministry of health,
said occasional errors meant the system was not fail-proof, but it was
ideally suited for developing countries which could not afford widespread
blood testing. Collecting saliva samples is quicker and requires less
training than traditional blood collection.
Such devices can also be used to test for other diseases, as well as
substances such as cocaine.
Other companies developing saliva test systems include Orgenics of Yavneh,
Israel and Trinity Biotech, an Irish company.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Management: A pension headache for the headhunted - There is
no easy answer when making provision for 'capped' executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
White's club in London. Sir Roly Split, chairman of Down-in-the-Dumps
Dredging, is poised to agree terms with Alec Smart, freshly headhunted chief
executive, when the latter suddenly insists: 'You will make sure that my
Down-in-the-Dumps pension arrangements are as good as they were at Wizard,
won't you?'.
Sir Roly is nonplussed. However, in common with other chairmen desperate for
talented managers at this stage in the cycle, he has no option but to agree.
He settles down to coffee and cigars, uncomfortably aware that he will have
to ask finance director Fred Fore how best to deliver.
Until four years ago there was no great problem; high-flying managers simply
joined an approved pension scheme (with all the tax breaks). The 1989
Finance Act, however, imposed an earnings 'cap' on the benefits from such
schemes, with the result that other ways are needed to top up the pension of
executives such as Smart. This year's decision by the UK Chancellor to leave
the 'cap' at Pounds 75,000 exacerbates the problem.
Some companies are simply paying higher salaries to 'capped' executives
(those who have joined their companies since 1989). This is potentially
divisive in the boardroom and almost certainly the expensive option for
employers.
It may also be tempting fate in the current climate of executive pay.
Company law requires pension costs to be included in a company's aggregate
remuneration for directors, whereas they are normally excluded from the
individual 'headline' figure on which media criticism is based.
The alternative to higher pay is to establish some sort of unapproved
pension scheme, ideally combining the executive's desire for security with
the company's need to restrict costs.
One solution is for the employer to finance the benefits on a pay-as-you-go
basis. There is no pre-funding, merely a balance sheet reserve built up each
year out of profits. That approach has the advantage of simplicity, but a
drawback is the uncertainty for an employee. If Down-in-the-Dumps slides
into receivership or liquidation - or is the object of a hostile takeover -
Smart joins the list of unsecured creditors. Unfunded arrangements,
moreover, create difficulties for early leavers.
None of these complications - lack of security, penalties for early leavers
 -arise with a funded scheme, whereby an employer sets aside contributions
in a trust fund for the executive concerned.
The up-front tax liability on contributions is off-putting. However,
according to New Bridge Street Consultants, affiliated to solicitors
Clifford Chance, it would make no difference mathematically were tax to be
paid on the emerging benefit - on the accumulated pension assets - rather
than on the up-front costs of funding them.
Assume that Pounds 100,000 could be paid into a trust fund tax free, that it
doubled in value during the life of the fund, and attracted tax at the
current top rate of 40 per cent when the employee cashed in his benefit. The
gross cost to the company (Pounds 100,000) and the net result for the
employee (Pounds 120,000) is exactly the same if tax is settled at the
outset. In this case the company pays Pounds 60,000 into the fund and a
Pounds 40,000 bonus direct to the executive to settle his tax liabilities
(Pounds 16,000 tax on the bonus itself, Pounds 24,000 tax on the pension
contribution).
For the employee, the choice between funded and unfunded schemes may be
influenced by the expected rate of income tax prevailing at retirement.
Paying 40 per cent on the contributions now is a more attractive option if
it is believed the top rate will be higher when ultimately applied to
unfunded benefits.
More important is the rate at which the underlying assets providing the
pension accumulate. It can be argued that the internal rate of return
generated on an employer's capital is the appropriate one for unfunded
investments, and that in a successful company this is bound to be greater
than the return on external assets (in a trust fund).
But David Reed, of Clifford Chance, says it is the marginal return on a
company's assets that counts: 'In any reasonably large company,
contributions to a funded scheme will merely deplete the cash balances or
add to borrowings.'
Besides beating bank interest in the longer term, the funded route is more
tax efficient. Income and capital gains incur corporation tax at the current
33 per cent rate inside a business, compared with the 20 or 25 per cent
suffered by a UK-based trust fund.
Better still is an offshore scheme, which suffers no immediate tax on income
or capital gains. But potential liability to tax on accumulated investment
income can be a problem and smaller companies may want to avoid the extra
costs of finding an offshore independent trustee.
New Bridge Street Consultants calculated the contribution rate for a
40-year-old man required to secure a pension of two-thirds final salary,
with a two-thirds widow's pension, assuming a gross investment return of 9
per cent (8.5 per cent for the offshore fund), salary increases of 7 per
cent and pension increases of 5 per cent.
Each year the unfunded option costs the company 78 per cent of the
executive's base salary, whereas UK and offshore funded plans cost 68 per
cent and 63 per cent respectively. If there were no 'earnings cap' on
approved schemes annual cost would be only 41 per cent.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Management: A new concept placed in context - Peter Drucker
tells Christopher Lorenz why he considers re-engineering vital for western
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW people are more wary of business fads than Peter Drucker. He is rightly
jealous of his long reputation as the proponent of a wide range of ideas
with real staying power, such as professional strategic analysis,
management-by-objectives, the importance of proper marketing and the
changing role of managers in knowledge-intensive organisations.
So why does the cover of a new bestseller on the latest fashion carry a
ringing endorsement from the 83-year-old Drucker that 're-engineering is new
and it has to be done'?
Face-to-face, Drucker concedes disarmingly that, in one sense,
re-engineering is far from novel: that the radical redesign of business
processes and their operation by cross-functional teams - which are the twin
cores of re-engineering - has been carried out by a string of western
companies for at least a decade, especially in product development and
manufacturing.
Drucker claims some chemical and pharmaceutical companies have used such
processes for even longer. And he traces re-engineering back as far as the
radical streamlining of retail ordering and stock control which Marks and
Spencer pioneered in the 1930s - using an old-fashioned cigar box, rather
than today's computer, to store vital information from the tags torn off by
cashiers.
So why make that claim on the book jacket? And why fuel the re-engineering
fashion still further, when Drucker warns against what he calls 'the disease
of having a cure-all every six weeks or five years'?
The reason is certainly not, as cynics might allege, that Drucker has worked
loosely in the past with Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two American
consultants who wrote the book, Re-engineering the Corporation*. The man is
too honest to exaggerate the importance of something just because of a
relationship. In any case, it was his belief in re-engineering which caused
him to work with them in the first place. He extols the importance of
'massive re-engineering' in his latest book, Post-Capitalist Society**.
'Look, re-engineering is new because we didn't have it as a concept before',
he says in conversation. Only when something is established as a systematic
discipline or organisable process, he argues, does it really have an impact
 -even if, 'as with all such things' there is a danger that some people will
see it as the solution to all their problems.
He considers re-engineering to be especially vital for Anglo-Saxon
companies, because of their past enthusiasm for innovation at the expense of
productivity. As he says, it was only in the 1980s that American industry
turned its attention to closing the productivity gap with Japan. Hence its
enthusiasm for total quality management, followed in quick succession by
'lean management' and now re-engineering.
Recognising the risk that companies will turn their backs on a difficult TQM
process in favour of the more glamorous promises of re-engineering, he
recalls a famous English historian's comment about a 19th century statesman:
that 'he tried to reduce the secret of diplomacy to one law, but that even
the Good Lord needed 10'.
'Not one of these things by itself provides the answer,' stresses Drucker.
Rather than any one supplanting the other, they are cumulative. Together, he
says they form the first of 'the three fingers of keeping an organisation
alive. He calls this the 'continuous improvement finger,' which is confusing
because re-engineering is far more dramatic than the 'continuous
improvement' of TQM. But he is adamant they are close cousins.
Whereas this first finger is basically inward-directed, the other two deal
more with a company's external strategy. The second is what Drucker calls
'exploitation - or rather, extension'.
He sees as the best example 'the enormous product range which Sony has built
out of one American product, the tape recorder'. The third finger is genuine
innovation - the basket into which America used to put all its eggs.
Just as mindful as he was decades ago of the need for companies to balance
short and long-term priorities, Drucker sees some danger that re-engineering
and other elements of the relatively short-term 'continuous improvement
finger' may distract attention from longer-term strategy and innovation. But
he welcomes its various facets as 'focusing overdue attention on
productivity improvement'.
Far more clearly than Hammer and Champy, he discriminates between two types
of re-engineering: the re-design of sub-processes, and the really exciting
stuff which, by reconfiguring entire processes, also alters the strategic
and competitive rules of an industry.
Much re-engineering, including order-handling and a Ford parts supply
process which Hammer tends to cite frequently, is of the first kind, claims
Drucker. 'It deals with very specific operations which are not too different
from what we talked about in operations research in the 1950s.'
In the second, more far-reaching category he puts the reconfiguration of
complete processes such as Wal-Mart's elimination of several levels of
retail stock-holding - or, for that matter, Benetton's.
These deal with the fundamental question of what work an organisation should
do, rather than just with the simpler one of how to do it. As for the
hotly-argued question of how to handle re-engineering and other 'change
management' processes, Drucker stresses that management structures, as well
as the business processes beneath them need to be re-engineered. He is also
in no doubt that there is little point trying to change an organisation's
'culture' before altering the tasks of the people within it.
He gives two reasons. First, 'culture is very largely dictated by the task -
take the very distinct cultures of a hospital or a school'. Second, 'culture
is very difficult to change - like the converted drunkard who doesn't hit
the bottle again until Monday morning, backsliders always outnumber
converts'.
True to the erudition which has always delighted his fans, Drucker
illuminates this managerial conundrum with a taste of philosophy: 'I grew up
an almost extreme believer in salvation by faith - I believed only in
Kierkegaard. But I've learned over 60 years that, for most people, salvation
by works is much more effective.'

It can be a laborious process to get a copy of a photographic print if the
original negative has been lost. Japanese film specialist Fujifilm has
developed a machine which can produce photographic reproductions of a print
or transparency in minutes.
The machine uses a thermal development and transfer technology similar to
that used in colour photocopiers. An image of the original picture is taken
on to film and then transferred on to paper. However, the picture is a true
photo, with a much higher resolution than the images produced by a colour
copier.
The process also has environmental advantages as the traditional 'wet'
chemical process - where a series of chemical baths are used to develop the
film - is no longer needed. Fujifilm believes the Pictrostat 2000 machine
will find a place in rapid film processing outlets. Fujifilm: Japan, tel: 03

fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The magnetic strip which appears on credit and debit cards has proven, in
many cases, to be woefully insecure, with the data easy to copy. Now
academics at Keele University, with industrial help from three companies,
have developed a security strip which fraudsters should find almost
impossible to tamper with.
The magnetic medium is sputtered in tiny drops onto the surface - paper,
metal or plastic - so it is impossible to peel off, unlike ordinary magnetic
strips. And the data held in the medium is encoded to prevent copying.
Massvision, which is marketing the strip and associated equipment, can write
instructions on to the strip so that only one other specific machine can
write on to that surface. This would mean that only the company issuing the
cheques, tickets, credit cards or holograms would be able to write on the
strip, preventing copying.
The genuine items could be easily verified at the retail outlet by using the
reader. Massvision: UK, tel: 021 708 0041.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Accountancy income dented: Competition and recession dent
earnings, league table shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intense competition and the effects of the recession severly dented the
income of the UK's acountancy firms during the last year, according to the
Fincial Times laegue table of the profession published today.
Fee income excluding expenses for the largest 30 firms was almost unchanged
between 1991-92 and 1992-93, while the number of partners professional staff
and offices fell sunstantially.
Two-thirds of the firms reported an absolute decline in income and most of
the increases were in single digits. The greatest growth was 17.5 per cent
at Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - and the
largest decline was 11.1 per cent at Casson Beckman.
Overall fee income rose just 0.2 per cent to $3.4bn, indicating stagnation
in the sector but also demonstrating the tremendous revenues now generated
by the profession.
The figures also show the growing dominance of the 'Big 6' firms, which
alone generated revenues of $2.6bn during the past year - or three quarters
of the total.
A year ago Coopers &amp; Lybrand was the only Big 6 firm to report a decline in
fee income. This year only one of the Big 6 - Andersen - has managed to
report any growth.
Across the firms (excluding Reeves &amp; Neylan, for which there were no
comparative figures) the number of partners fell by 4 per cent to 5,010.
Other professional staff fell nearly 6 per cent to 43,449.
The results show the growing diversity of services provided by accountants.
Among those which break out activities, audit and related accounting
services compromises on average just 41 per cent of total fee income. It is
below half for all but 11 of the 30 firms. Total audit fees fell 2.4 per
cent to $1.4bn during the period.
Insolvency income - now making up 11 per cnet of the total - rose by 10.8
per cent to $389m. It accounts for as much as 43 per cent of income for Levy
Gee and 27 per cent at Robson Rhodes.
Tax recenues - 23 per cent of the total - dropped 0.3 per cent to $787m,
while those from consulting - 20 per cent of the total - rose 1 per cent to
$674m.
Beyond the four prinicipal divisions there are many other activities, such
as $1.9m generated by the corporate finance group at KPMG Peat Marwick.
Acountancy firms ar under no legal obligation to publish financial
information because they are private partnerships. They persistently refuse
to provide details of profits. Andersen has the highest ratio of
professional staff to partners and the highest fees generated by each
partner, at nearly $1.6m.
The figures are adjusted as far as posible to allow for comparisons, but
many of the stated year-ends are different, and other factors such as
mergers and widely differing structures confuse the position.
Several - such as Moore Rowlands - are associations of different firms
rather than a unified organsiation, while a number of others - like BDO
Binder Hamlyn and KPMG Peat Marwick - compromise separate partnerships.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL MORRISON, out-going deputy senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, is
set to become chairman of the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary
body.
Morrison will be appointed to head the Joint Disciplinary Scheme in
succession to Sir Anthony Wilson, who retires at the end of September after
a three-year term.
The scheme is operated jointly by the two chartered accountancy institutes
covering Scotland, and England and Wales, and the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
Wilson says he is pleased to have helped restructure and streamline the
scheme during his term. 'The problem from the outside is that people see
delays. But these big cases are very complex and justice has to be
administered fairly and open-handedly.'
The scheme has the power to examine and discipline member firms and any
individual members in either public practice or commercial work. It only
examines matters in which there is a high level of public interest.
Current cases under review are the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
and Barlow Clowes. It is also shortly to announce an examination of the
Maxwell affair.
Morrison announced he was retiring from KPMG 'amicably' in February to
pursue 'an alternative career', in advance of the appointment of Mr Colin
Sharman as senior partner.
He was also president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland
in 1984-85, and has been visiting professor in accountancy at the University
of Strathclyde since 1983.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Accountancy income plunges: Competition and recession dent
earnings, league table shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSE COMPETITION and the effects of the recession severely dented the fee
income of the UK's accountancy firms, according to the Financial Times
league table of the profession published today.
Revenues excluding expenses for the largest 30 firms were stable over the
past 12 months while the number of partners, professional staff and offices
has fallen substantially.
Just one third of the firms reported growth in income, with most of these
reporting single digit increases. The greatest growth was 17.5 per cent at
Andersen, and the biggest decline 11.1 per cent at Casson Beckman.
Fees from audit fell 0.6 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn, but were offset by an
11.3 per cent increase in insolvency to Pounds 352m, 2.7 per cent growth to
Pounds 784m in tax and 2.2 per cent growth to Pounds 667m in management
consulting.
The number of partners rose 1.5 per cent to 5,037 but the number of other
professional staff fell nearly 5 per cent to 43,600.
The figures show that accountancy firms are an enormous business, with the
top 30 generating more than Pounds 3.4bn in the 12 months to this spring.
They also demonstrate the continued dominance of the 'Big 6' firms. These
largest firms alone generated revenues of Pounds 2.6bn during the past year
 - or three quarters of the total for the highest 30. This concentration of
control in a few hands has grown substantially over the last decade.
A year ago, Coopers &amp; Lybrand was the only Big 6 firm to report a decline in
fee income. This year, only one of the Big 6  - Andersen  - has managed to
report positive growth.
Just one third of the firms reported growth in income.
The figures are the best attempt to make fee income from the firms
comparable, but the process is made difficult for a wide range of reasons
including two firms which have reported for the first time this year.
Accountancy firms  - while they are substantial businesses in their own
right  - are under no obligation to publish any financial information
because they are private partnerships and not limited companies. They
persistently refuse to provide details of profits.
Many of the firms' year-ends are different, although most have attempted to
compile figures for the 12 months to April or May this year. Some have had
income boosted by mergers during the year. Several - such as Moore Rowlands
 - are associations of different firms rather than a unified organisation,
while a number of others  - like BDO Binder Hamlyn and KPMG Peat Marwick  -
comprise separate partnership.
Others have very distinct businesses. For example, 56 per cent of Andersen's
revenues come from Andersen Consulting, an all but autonomous business. Two
fifths of Smith &amp; Williamson's revenues come from its investments and
securities arm.
The firms have different policies on issues including staff on secondments,
allocating revenue between their operating divisions, and their practices in
Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Thatcherite Pascall turns up at MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Pascall, the BP executive who chaired the National Curriculum Council
until April, has turned up in the City as finance director of a division of
MAI, the finance, media and information services group.
It is no surprise that 44-year-old Pascall, a chemical engineer and 25-year
veteran of BP, has left the oil giant. He had masterminded the controversial
Project 90 reorganisation for Bob Horton, BP's ousted chief.
It is understood to be Horton, a friend since St Andrews University days
with the then minister for education John MacGregor, who raised Pascall's
name as a suitable industrialist to become a member of the NCC in 1990.
Pascall took on the chair a year later in what was seen at the time as a
firmly political appointment by Kenneth Clarke, the next secretary for
state.
Branded a Thatcherite for his stint at No:10's policy unit in the
mid-1980's, Pascall made no secret of his bitter disappointment when the job
of chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority  - which,
he said, he had been given strong indications he would be offered  - was
given to the apolitical Sir Ron Dearing.
'Everyone thinks that all of education is a mess,' he adds about his time at
NCC, 'but we have done significant work on the curriculum; Sir Ron now needs
to do the same on testing'.
Meanwhile,Pascall says Lord Hollick, MAI chief executive, made him 'a very
interesting offer'. He joins in the newly created capacity of finance
director of the money and securities broking division, but does not go on
the main board. The division has six regional finance directors, who will
report into Pascall.
Pascall's varied career included four years in BP's finance department, at
the time of the government share sale and then during the MMC inquiry into
the Kuwaiti Investment Office's shareholding.
He had earlier done an MBA specialising in finance at Inseat under BP
sponsorship.

FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Safe pair of hands for Ireland's AIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest company in Ireland has a new chieftain. Jim Culliton, one of
Ireland's most respected industrialists, is to take over the chairmanship of
Allied Irish Banks, following Peter Sutherland's appointment as
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The 59-year-old Culliton, former chief executive of building products group
CRH where he started his career, is more than a dozen years older than
Sutherland, who took on the chairmanship in October 1989 after he stepped
down as a European Community Competition commissioner.
Without the same sort of international profile, as Sutherland, Culliton is
regarded as a safe pair of hands  - important because in addition to losing
its chairman, AIB is also in the process of changing chief executives. Next
March Tom Mulcahy, 51, takes over from Gerry Scanlan, who has been running
AIB for the last nine years. Culliton has been on the AIB board since 1984.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Close contest for leadership of Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE race for the leadership of Canada's ruling Progressive Conservative
party has turned into a neck-and-neck contest between Ms Kim Campbell,
defence minister, and Mr Jean Charest, environment minister.
The contest, based on personalities rather than policies, is reflected in
the feverish last-minute campaigns by both front-runners to secure the
loyalty of the 3,800 delegates attending the party convention this weekend
in Ottawa.
The winner, to be chosen by secret ballot on Sunday afternoon, will succeed
Mr Brian Mulroney as prime minister and lead the Conservatives in a general
election this year.
Opinion polls, which had given Ms Campbell a seemingly unassailable lead,
still give her the edge among delegates committed to one of the five
candidates. But the 34-year-old Mr Charest has made a strong showing.
Conservatives were initially excited by the idea of having a bilingual woman
from British Columbia at their helm. But Ms Campbell has since been
characterised as a prickly intellectual, her French has turned out to be
less fluent than she had claimed, and attention has been drawn to her being
twice-divorced.
The Globe and Mail newspaper said in an editorial this week that she
displayed 'a brittleness, a nervous insistence on the rightness of her cause
that will not wear well with time.' Also, it applauded Mr Charest for 'a
quick mind, a likeable demeanour and a plain way of speaking.'
His main drawback remains the unease among Conservatives about choosing
another Quebecer as their national leader  - he is a staunch federalist,
committed to protect the rights of Quebec's English-speaking minority.
But the Charest camp has been lifted by the endorsement by two of the
party's most influential English-speaking ministers  - Mr Joe Clark,
ex-prime minister, and Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister.
Convention delegates and the public have few clues to how Ms Campbell or Mr
Charest would tackle Canada's economic and social issues.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Councillors warned of tough times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW local government minister, Mr David Curry, told the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities yesterday that this year's settlement for local
government 'will be tough'.
He also differed sharply from local authority leaders on the issues of
capping council budgets and the distribution of government grants to
councils.
All parties on the AMA - meeting at a conference in Coventry - voted for
radical changes to local government finance in what they called a 'Coventry
Declaration' for local accountability.
The declaration stated: 'Accountability cannot be effective when on average
authorities raise less than 20 per cent of their revenue through locally
determined sources. To remedy the accountability deficit business rates
should be restored to local control and additional sources of local funding
should be investigated.'
The AMA also called for:
An end to the capping of authorities' budgets as a 'negation of local
accountability'.
A review of standard spending assessments, which were criticised by the
Audit Commission last month.
General grants, rather than ear-marked grants for specific purposes.
The relaxation of restrictions on the use of capital receipts and on
borrowing.
Mr Curry pledged to make the system of standard spending assessments for
councils fairer if he could, and to conduct a review of standard spending
assessments openly.
But he added: 'Local authorities spend about Pounds 60bn a year. You have to
decide how to use that money. You are no bit players, and that is why it is
nonsense to suggest that local democracy is under threat.'
He made clear that he wanted to avoid confrontation, by saying: 'You can,
and do, influence our thinking and actions. I cannot promise always to agree
with you - I do promise always to listen.'
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, also addressed the
conference, and supported several of the councillors' recommendations.
He called for the abolition of capping, saying that 'every year, the system
will throw up perverse and erratic consequences'.
He also endorsed the call for non-domestic rates to be set locally, saying
that such a move would more than double the proportion of local authority
budgets set locally.
Mr Straw repeated his call for an independent commission to decide on grants
to councils, and for annual elections in each authority, which would have
the power of veto over council budgets.
He said: 'This would apply the principle of no taxation without
representation to local self-government.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Scrapping Tecs computer system may cost Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPUTER system developed by the Department of Employment to underpin the
administration of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England
and Wales has been abandoned by the department at a potential cost of more
than Pounds 50m.
The Tecs had complained that the system was difficult to operate, had many
shortcomings and did not adequately meet their needs. In all, some 7,000
errors and requests for changes to the system had been recorded by April
this year.
The National Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, says today in a
sharply critical report that the failure of the Tecs computer system to work
properly was a result of glaring management inadequacies.
Now that the department has decided to withdraw from the system, the Tecs
will have to make their own computing arrangements using their own funds.
The office says there is no guarantee that they will be able to mount a more
appropriate or cost-effective solution.
It says the debacle exemplifies many of the deficiencies 'commonly found in
recent years in the management and control of government computer projects'.
Among the faults it identified, all typical of poorly managed computer
projects, were:
Failure to make rigorous risk assessments as timescales and requirements
changed.
Failure to involve users of the system from the outset to ensure the
intended purpose was being met.
Failure to manage a technically complex project effectively.
It is equally critical of the department's decision to pull out of the
provision of IT services to the Tecs. It says: 'It is unfortunate that the
decision was not informed by a comprehensive cost benefit analysis',
concluding that 'without such an analysis, it is unclear whether the way
forward chosen by the department represents the most appropriate and cost
effective means of meeting Tecs information technology needs.'
The Tecs were established between 1990 and 1991 to develop local training,
enterprise and education strategies. They are companies which negotiate
annual contracts with the department of Employment to improve the
Governments' Pounds 1.7bn a year training and enterprise programmes.
The computer system, known as the Field System, was designed to replace the
inefficient stand-alone computers used by the department's field offices.
With the establishment of the Tecs, the department redesigned the system to
meet the needs of the new organisation. It expected the Tecs to use the
system, budgeted at Pounds 71m, into the 1990s.
Some Pounds 48m had been spent by April this year when the department pulled
out of the project. The NAO said the Tecs spent a further Pounds 4.6m of
their own funds on additional software, hardware, training and support in
attempting to make the system work.
A vital module, designed to deal with payments and accounting, was so
unwieldy that most Tecs continued, for an average of 16 months, to use a
manual alternative.
The module was eventually overhauled at a cost of Pounds 2m, but even so by
August last year 20 of 71 Tecs surveyed by the NAO said they had selected
alternative systems to produce payments and accounting information.
The NAO says the way the department managed the project and its disregard
for contract tendering and letting procedures in the appointment of computer
consultants to work on the project amounted to 'serious failing in control'.
Consultancy had been budgeted at about Pounds 2.3m; by September last year
some Pounds 11m had been spent on more than 200 individuals and firms.

FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Standard's latest board move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday put
in place one of the final elements in its reorganisation of senior
management following the retirement of Rodney Galpin, the bank's chairman,
last month.
Following Standard's recruitment of Peter Wood, formerly Barclays' finance
director, as head of finance, it announced that John McFarlane, Citibank's
UK chief executive, (pictured right) is to join the bank as an executive
director.
McFarlane replaces Alan Orsich, deputy managing director. He will work under
Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, alongside Wood, David Moir, head of
Asia Pacific operations, and David Broome, head of Standard's banking
business.
Williamson has been working on a new management structure to tighten
management controls and prevent a repetition of costly accidents such as the
Bombay securities trading scandal, which lost the bank Pounds 305m in India
last year.
McFarlane and Wood's recruitment is part of a reform of senior management
which will strengthen functional reporting lines rather than operating
Standard's businesses more through managers in regions and countries around
the world.
McFarlane has worked for Citibank since 1975, although his career started
outside financial services in the power train division of Ford Motor
Company's Dagenham plant. At Citibank, he worked in treasury, capital
markets, and global finance.
McFarlane, a 45-year-old Scot with an MA from Edinburgh University and an
MBA from Cranfield, said it had been 'an agonising decision' to leave
Citibank but he felt he had achieved the task he was set as chief executive
in 1990.
He said Standard's global business, with a concentration in the Asia
Pacific, had 'a lot of similarities' to Citibank. He is likely to work
closely with Wood in reviewing controls and risk, although the final
structure is yet to be refined.

FT  11 JUN 93 / DTI plans review of company law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to consider ways of easing
disincorporation for companies and to reduce the amount of information
required to be filed at Companies House, as part of a review of company law.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, speaking at the Institute of
Company Accountants' founders' lecture yesterday, announced the creation of
six working groups to consider some of the more technical aspects of the
law.
The subjects to be covered by the groups flesh out some of the details of
the review of the 1985 Companies Act unveiled by Mr Hamilton last November.
He says the main thrust of the review is deregulation.
The groups will be made up of business people, lawyers, accountants and DTI
officials, and will prepare discussion papers for public consultation. They
will include:
Improvements in the operation of Company Voluntary Arrangements, an
insolvency procedure to keep companies out of liquidation, which has been
used only infrequently since it was introduced.
A reduction in the number of requirements to file information at Companies
House.
The law on groups of companies.
Disincorporation by companies wishing to shed corporate status.
Section 151 of the 1985 Act, limiting or prohibiting companies from
assisting people to buy shares in them.

Department of Transport official Mr Frank Wall was giving evidence to the
Donaldson inquiry into the Braer oil disaster off Shetland.
The maximum liability is between Pounds 2.3m and Pounds 30m compared with
Pounds 129m available after a serious oil spill.
Mr Wall said the government was frustrated by the lack of progress towards
an international agreement in spite of 20 years of diplomatic wrangling.
He warned that the world seemed to be waiting for the chemical equivalent of
an accident like the Titanic or the Amoco Cadiz before acting.
A draft convention is being considered by the International Maritime
Organisation but it is hampered by the definition of hazardous cargo and
whetherthat should cover material in bulk or in packages.
The London hearing was told that 400 claims were lodged after the Braer
spill, and 244 had been settled by the International Oil Pollution
Compensation Fund. Slightly more than Pounds 10m had been paid out.

FT  11 JUN 93 / IRA admits planting two Tyneside bombs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA claimed responsibility yesterday for setting off bombs at two
industrial compounds on Tyneside within 24 hours.
The first incident, in which a Gateshead gasholder was damaged by an
explosion and fire in the first few minutes of Wednesday morning, was
followed late on Wednesday night by two explosions at an Esso petrol and oil
storage terminal in North Shields.
No deaths or injuries resulted, although no advance warnings were given.
Mr David Mellish, assistant chief constable of Northumbria, said it seemed
the aim was was to achieve maximum damage and publicity rather than injury.
'But, because of the nature of the gas and petrol involved at both scenes,
it could have had potentially tremendous implications,' he said.
The Esso terminal was bombed by the IRA only seven weeks ago. 'It's not only
embarrassing, it's extremely annoying,' said Esso.
Last May, the IRA admitted planting 11 incendiary devices at the nearby
MetroCentre shopping complex.
Newcastle University politics lecturer Mr David George, a terrorism
specialist, warned that the region's large number of Far East companies were
a potential target.
In its statement the IRA warned; 'The British establishment are obviously
slow learners, but we in the IRA are patient teachers.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Row over schools funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department for Education yesterday admitted that grant-maintained
schools, which have opted out of local education authority control, had been
double-funded by Pounds 13.6m.
However, it denied a claim by Labour that grant-maintained schools would now
be 'squeezed'. It said: 'Education Secretary John Patten is committed to
ensuring that GM schools continue to get the extra funding they need to meet
their added responsibilities as self-governing schools.'
Figures revealed in a parliamentary answer to Mr Win Griffiths, a Labour
education spokesman, and analysed by Local Schools Information, which is
funded by local education authorities, showed that 260 schools received
greater compensation for the loss of LEA services than those opting out this
year. It also showed that 127 schools received more than Pounds 50,000 a
year more than if they had opted out this year.
The anomaly arose because early opt-out schools received cash protection for
the amount of central grant paid to them to reflect the loss of local
education authority services, while schools remaining in local authority
control received less grant as more services were devolved to them under the
local management of schools programme.
The department said cash protection would continue for early opt-out schools
because they had already made spending plans.
It also published a second consultation paper on how a common funding
formula for all state-maintained schools would work.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT DIDN'T make the front pages. But at least it made the front pages of the
sports sections, which soccer rarely does in the US - especially not on
mornings after the ice hockey finals, the first round of the basketball
championship series and a full major league baseball schedule.
The New York Times even thought it worthy of wry humour. Its skyline read:
'In another upset, Colonials 2, Redcoats 0.' Just in case the point was
missed, the match report was headlined; 'Redcoats in Massachusetts? You
already know the result.'
Other newspapers were a little more prosaic about the US victory over
England's soccer team in Foxboro. The Washington Post's historical
comparison could only reach back as far as 1989 to the great US triumph in
the World Cup qualifying competition over mighty Trinidad and Tobago.
Of course, there were many references to the 1950 US victory over England in
Belo Horizonte, but that achievement had always been far more infamous to
the English than to the Americans. After all, in 1950 Ted Williams was still
in his prime and Jackie Robinson, the first black in major league baseball,
was capturing the national imagination.
This time there was simple amazement at Wednesday's result. For this is a US
team whose record in its previous 15 matches, several against Caribbean and
Central American powerhouses, was miserable. One win (over Saudi Arabia),
five losses and nine draws; it had not scored in nearly 400 minutes of play.
Soccer has had a hard time re-establishing itself in the US since Pele hung
up his boots for the New York Cosmos 15 years ago. But, as host of next
year's World Cup, the US soccer establishment is at least trying and a
victory over England can do no harm.

FORD'S ENGINES plant at Bridgend in south Wales is achieving greater
productivity than rival Japanese car manufacturers, Mr Ray Pittman, European
engine operations manager, said yesterday.
He made the claim as Ford disclosed that pan-European demand for its new
Mondeo family car range had led to Bridgend almost doubling production of
Zeta engines.
Mr Pittman said Bridgend was capable of building 100 units an hour.
Comparable Japanese plants were building equivalent 16-valve engines at 60
to 70 units an hour.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER than one in 20 company car drivers say they will give up their cars in
exchange for cash from their employers before a tax system is introduced
next April, although most drivers expect to pay more under the new regime, a
Mori survey shows.
Publication of the survey, carried out for Lex Service group's vehicle
leasing subsidiary, follows hard on the heels of a report from employee
benefits specialists Stoy Benefit Consulting. This concluded that nearly six
out of 10 UK executives would be better off by handing back their company
cars in exchange for extra pay and a mileage allowance to run their own
cars.
The Mori survey of more than 600 company car drivers found that 72 per cent
expected to pay more tax, but 52 per cent said the new regime would have no
effect on either the type of car they drove or its specification.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Football tax-abuse inquiries span decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, DAVID HELLIER and PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue has been systematically investigating tax abuses by
British football clubs and players for more than 10 years. During the same
period a number of clubs have been punished for breaching football's rules
on player payments.
Mr Reg Burr, the chairman of Millwall, said yesterday that 'professional
footballers as a body seem to think that they do not have to pay tax'.
Inspectors from the Revenue's special office in Edinburgh started examining
expense payments made to semi-professional clubs in the north of England at
the beginning of the 1980s. Several investigations have since been conducted
into professional and semi-professional leagues throughout the country.
During the mid 1980s a second Revenue special office in Leeds started
examining suspected tax evasion in connection with transfer fees for
professional players moving between clubs. They examined records stretching
back as far as 1981. That led to an agreement between football's governing
bodies and the Revenue in 1988 setting down guidelines on future ex gratia
payments to players.
The Revenue's compliance and collection division also became involved in an
investigation into Swindon Town football club in 1990, which led to the
imprisonment of the chairman for six months.
Tax inspectors based in Solihull, West Midlands, are co-ordinating
investigations into transfer payments and other activities in professional
football. A separate team in Leeds examines the semi-professional game.
A number of semi-professional clubs had - often undisclosed - contracts with
players but were not using the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system and so were
able to provide footballers with additional payments as travelling expenses.
Those on contracts should have been paid through PAYE.
Professional clubs have been avoiding the tax that players should pay for
signing-on fees by channelling the money to the club where a player has
previously been employed, from where it is passed on as a termination
payment, on which no tax is due.
Mr Burr pointed out that many players had agents. He did not regard this as
bad in itself, but there was a lack of regulation of these agents, he said.
He knew of some managers' contracts which stipulated that the manager
received a percentage of any sales they made. 'At least when it's written
into a contract, that's official,' he said.
Terry Neil, the former Arsenal player who is now a radio commentator and
sports consultant, said that the football authorities had a duty to
investigate the allegations of corruption within the game fully.
'It is crucial that they do so for the sake of the game. It is very sad to
see the game now being dragged down in this manner,' he said.
The Football Association is also investigating the transfers of three
Australians to English clubs, Mark Bosnich, the Aston Villa goalkeeper, and
Shaun Murphy and Bob Catlin of Notts County. Both clubs are alleged to have
made payments to the players' agent, which break the rules of Fifa,
football's international governing body.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Imro backs down over training proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMRO, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has
withdrawn controversial proposals for the training of professionals that
would require fund managers to undergo 50 hours of continuing education each
year.
The proposals, released in April, sparked protests from Imro members who
claimed the rules were arbitrary, unnecessary and unenforceable. The
Institutional Fund Managers Association, an industry trade body, had earlier
met both Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulatory watchdog, to register its objections.
The drafting of the training rules followed an SIB directive to all four of
the City's self-regulating bodies that they set training and competence
requirements for employees of their member companies. An earlier set of
proposals for training and competence rules for Imro members had been
criticised by the SIB for falling short of the regimen set out by the other
self-regulating bodies.
In a letter to Imro members earlier this week, chief executive Mr John
Morgan noted the industry concerns and said Imro had decided to review the
proposals. Instead, the organisation will prepare a new consultation
document, to be released in July, which will take into account all the
objections raised by its members 'to ensure that full weight is given to all
concerns', he said.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Sotheby's helps to bail out Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S, the London auction house, is offering a discreet tailor-made
service to Lloyd's Names who want to sell the family silver - or other
heirlooms.
'We are not coffin chasers, but we have a market where a lot of people are
looking to raise capital,' said Mr James Miller of Sotheby's.
It has received 'thousands' of inquiries in recent months from Names,
individuals whose capital underwrites the insurance market. Sotheby's is to
meet members' agents next week to advise on auction rescue packages.
The meeting, the first of its kind in Lloyd's 300-year-old history, comes as
many Names are close to ruin.
The auction house offers Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans
of up to 35 per cent on the value of objects sent for sale and free surveys.
It also promises 'total anonymity'.
Mr Miller heads a special advisory service which is already dealing with
about 2,000 Names, most of whom are seeking to raise between Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 100,000.
Sotheby's counsels them about which objects to sell: 'Some people might say
'I can't bear to sell that painting - what about the candlesticks?' But we
might have to point out that there are already lots of candlesticks on the
market, so why don't they look at the chest of drawers?'
The main objects being sold are silver, jewellery, paintings and furniture.
Sotheby's said the flood of new pieces had not, as yet, triggered a
significant fall in their prices for silver and jewellery, although prices
in the furniture market have dipped in the last year.
'Most of the silver does seem to be mopped up,' said Mr Richard Came, silver
consultant at Sotheby's.
Among the hard hit Names themselves, the mood is more bitter. 'It's a
buyers' market', said Mr Norbet Mallet, who, as a result of losses of more
than Pounds 1m with the Gooda Walker syndicates, has had to sell most of his
family jewellery in the last two years, at prices he believes are 'some 30
per cent lower' than 1980s prices.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Lloyd's tightens rules on EGMs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London yesterday amended rules under which its Names can call
extraordinary general meetings. The move came amid fears that such
gatherings could undermine the confidence of potential investors at the
insurance market.
The decision increases the minimum number of signatures of Names - the
individuals whose assets support the market - needed for a meeting to be
called from 100 to 1,500. It is not retrospective, however and does not
affect the EGM called by supporters of Mr Claud Gurney and arranged for July
5.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said: 'I am very concerned with the disruption.
I must do everything I can to maintain confidence.'
The changes had been introduced 'to bring Lloyd's more into line with
company procedures giving members of Lloyd's rights similar to shareholders
in companies'.
An EGM organised last year had cost more than Pounds 130,000, and had
disrupted the business of the market.
Mr Rowland added: 'I can't begin to explain the enormous diversion of
management time. If we are going to take the society through to a better
future we have to be free to run it.'
The decision met a mixed response from Names. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the
Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest Names' organisation, said that
the change 'must not muzzle criticism or blunt reform of Lloyd's in any
way'.
He said, however, that the council 'has made a commonsense response in
changing this unrealistic byelaw, and we believe the membership will
benefit'.
Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, said that the
change would not thwart his own efforts to hold an EGM calling for the
liquidation of Lloyd's. 'Lloyd's can run but not hide,' he said. 'This
pathetic attempt to compare itself with company procedures will rebound.'
Mr Astor also disclosed yesterday that he was organising legal action
against at least two former chairmen of the insurance market.
He would not reveal the identity of the former chairmen concerned but said
Names intended to issue procedings alleging deceit soon.
'The chairmen owed fiduciary duties which they breached. They obtained the
deposits of Lloyd's Names by deception,' Mr Astor said.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Truck sales up 18% last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new trucks jumped by 18.2 per cent last month, indicating that at
least one sector of the commercial vehicle market is well on the road to
recovery.
However, sales of all other categories of commercial vehicles remained below
the severely depressed levels of a year ago.
Hopes that the important market for panel vans, typified by the Ford
Transit, might also be coming out of recession were dashed by statistics
published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
In April panel van sales had risen by 1.7 per cent year-on-year and the
completion of the management buy-out of Leyland Daf Vans had also been
expected to give last month's van market a boost.
Instead May's total panel van sales showed a 9.76 per cent sales drop
compared with the same month last year.
There was some consolation for Leyland Daf Vans. Its share of the panel van
market jumped to 13.67 per cent in May, as new orders flowed in the wake of
the buy-out's completion.
Its share had fallen to a low of 6.5 per cent in March during the van
operation's two-month spell in receivership.
The May figure was close to the 14 per cent market share achieved by the
company for all of 1992.
Panel van market leader Ford had been the principal beneficiary of Leyland
Daf Vans' problems, its market share reaching 52.2 per cent in March. Last
month, however,it dropped back to 46.5 per cent.
At 15,311, total sales of commercial vehicles last month were down 4.45 per
cent on the 16,024 achieved in May last year.
Sales for this year's first five months, at 82,482, were 4.46 per cent down
on the same period last year.
A continuing surge in the volume of light vans imported from Portugal by
Vauxhall, General Motors' UK subsidiary, helped to boost the import share of
commercial vehicle sales from 32.06 per cent to 38.2 per cent.
For the year to date, the importers' share is running at 39.9 per cent, up

FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Sir Humphreys chafe at
'disarray'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Whitehall's senior mandarins, the current disarray in the government
means frustration and inactivity - and it is something they don't like.
This may seem strange to devotees of the BBC-TV series Yes Minister, in
which Sir Humphrey Appleby, the permanent secretary in charge of the
mythical Department of Administrative Affairs, perennially runs rings round
his minister, Jim Hacker. The wily Sir Humphrey would undoubtedly use the
current crisis to seize control of the reins and get on with running the
department.
But the reality is rather different. 'Officials are most effective when they
get clear and confident decisions from ministers,' says one high-flying
civil servant at grade 3 (under-secretary) level.
'This sort of disarray is never pleasant because it becomes very difficult
to get ministers to make decisions.'
The hiatus can be dispiriting for civil servants involved in policy-making,
says a deputy secretary at the top of a large spending department. 'They may
have spent months working up policy options only to see them shelved because
of loss of political nerve.'
Such indecision may be even more damaging in economic policy-making, where
the need for radical solutions to the burgeoning public spending bill are
urgently needed.
And an uncertain parliamentary majority makes ministers less willing to
stand behind their decisions, according to a senior civil servant managing a
high-profile public service.
'When their backbenchers raise objections to the consequences of policy
decisions, they look for ways of meeting the objections.'
'We are already seeing a revisiting of decisions,' says another who has had
to cope with a change of minister.
'People often forget that a reshuffle can be at least as disruptive as a
change of government. With a new government, we generally know what the
policy will be - that isn't always clear with a new minister from the same
party.'
There is hope in the Treasury, however, that the long-expected reshuffle may
improve the relationship between No 10 and No 11 Downing Street, so
necessary for smooth running of the government machine.
'The connecting door between the two seems to have been little used in
recent months,' says one close observer.
'It had begun to feel like the Thatcher/Lawson days when the prime minister
and the chancellor communicated by public announcement.'
There is general satisfaction in Whitehall at the way Mr Lamont used his
resignation statement to exonerate officials from blame for policy failures.
By firmly pinning responsibility on the politicians, Mr Lamont dealt a blow
to those on the right who have been seeking to attribute recent policy
disasters to civil servants.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Soldiers await firm orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG THE battle-scarred foot soldiers in the Tory ranks at Westminster the
widespread message for Mr John Major is that they would like the prime
minister to tell them more clearly and more often where they are going - and
why they are fighting.
As for the charges levelled by Mr Norman Lamont, many backbenchers agreed
that there was too much short-termism - 'bouncing along from crisis to
crisis' - as one put it, but other MPs commented ruefully that they would
have welcomed signs of ministers paying closer attention to opinion
pollsters.
Tories across the party accept that concessions in response to potential
Commons rebellions and changes to unpopular policies are a necessary part of
governing with a small majority when people generally still do not feel
confident about the economy.
But there are doubts - most forcefully expressed on the right of the party -
about how thoroughly changes are made, and anxiety that sometimes the least
objectionable rather than the right solution is found. 'You can trim a bit
too far,' said one MP.
Backbenchers with little sympathy for Mr Lamont's argument were quick to
accuse him of sour grapes, and to suggest that the populist decision that he
had primarily in mind was his own dismissal.
As for any broader point: 'If he felt like that, why didn't he speak out
while he was still in cabinet?' one loyalist asked.
MPs seeking to rebut the charge that policies were taken for short-term
popularity rather than for the long term, at times seemed spoiled for
choice. Rail privatisation, education reform and measures to restore the
state of public finances - including the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel - were all cited.
Above all, there was the issue that has riven the Tory party for more than a
year. One MP said with feeling: 'You can't really accuse a government which
put us all through the torture of Maastricht of having its eyes on
short-term popularity.'
Even those who do not accept Mr Lamont's account of the working of
government, believe that there are ways in which Mr Major should improve his
performance. One former minister advised him to ignore the newspapers, while
several said he should find himself some new advisers and aides.
The most serious concern was that the prime minister did not use the
opportunity of Wednesday's speech to spell out where the Tory party was
heading and did not offer his Commons troops a way forward which they could
cheer.
A junior minister said: 'He needed to set out a context, a vision. When you
talk to him one-to-one you get a clear idea of where he's coming from, but
that gets lost when he speaks in the Commons.'
Another put it more bluntly: 'He should be more prime ministerial.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Tory infighting ends
camaraderie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT WAS meant to mark a return to collegiate government
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a break with the dogmatic autocracy of the Thatcher era. After a decade
spent dodging prime ministerial brickbats, Mr John Major's promise to
replace ideology with consensualism was greeted with child-like enthusiasm
by cabinet colleagues.
That was two-and-a-half years ago. Now Mr Major is charged with ineffective
leadership and a preference for favourable headlines over hard policy
decisions.
In Mr Norman Lamont's book, consensualism has degenerated into compromise
and politics has subsumed policy. The charge contains more than a grain of
truth. But it was liberally sprinkled with personal invective and
self-justification. His former colleagues dismissed the critique as one of
style rather than substance.
But the most persistent concern of many, both inside and outside Mr Major's
government, has been whether he possesses that intangible but vital quality
for political leaders - grip. Without it, even active governments can appear
to lack direction. With it, the most opportunist administrations can conjure
up the illusion of certainty and authority.
In part it is a question of personality. In some politicians - Mr Kenneth
Clarke is the obvious example - centrist, pragmatic, man-of-the-people
instincts can be symbols of political strength. In others the same traits
are too easily seen as indicative of weakness, indecision.
Mr Major has yet to convince his peers at Westminster that he does not fall
into the latter camp. Whitehall officials fear his commitment to painstaking
and democratic decision-making has stalled the workings of government.
Too many judgments are made on a lowest-common-denominator basis. Too many
others are shelved. The Downing Street machine - the policy unit and the
prime minister's private office - have neither the drive nor the authority
to break the logjams.
Mrs Sarah Hogg, the head of the policy unit, is criticised for concentrating
on the detail of individual initiatives instead of shaping the broader
political direction of policymaking.
Outside No 10, two-and-a-half years of economic recession, the war within
the Conservative party over Maastricht and the debacle of sterling's exit
from the exchange rate mechanism have replaced the 'we're all in it
together' camaraderie of November 1990 with more traditional backbiting.
Rows over the pit closure programme, reform of the police, London hospitals,
economic policy-making and most recently school testing have been freely
leaked by the protagonists.
Mr Lamont's critique sits uneasily with his equally strong claim that his
stewardship of the Treasury was marked by a bold long-termism which
invariably put policy before politics.
Many in Whitehall believe that he was as ineffectual as any in the cabinet.
Described by one mandarin as 'idle', the former chancellor was viewed by
many officials as unwilling or unable to punch the Treasury's weight in
Whitehall.
He also had a personal score to settle during Wednesday's performance. The
two men who most impressed on the prime minister the need for a new
chancellor were his party managers - Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, and
Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip. It is hardly surprising that the former
chancellor claimed that too much weight had been given to their views in the
inner circles of government.
They are both extremely influential. Mr Ryder is one of the men closest to
the prime minister. His authority in a government with a majority of only 18
is much greater than that of his predecessors during the 1980s. Sir Norman
meanwhile represents Mr Major's links with the party activists. He is
temperamentally close to the prime minister - another man from Middle
England.
Mr Lamont is not alone in believing that their influence has sometimes been
too great. There has been resentment also about the role of Lord Wakeham -
the arch-fixer of Mr Major's administration frequently charged to settle
interdepartmental disputes.
Mr Clarke is among those who have called for more active leadership of the
parliamentary party at Westminster, arguing within the cabinet that timidity
and delay can be more destablising even that sometimes unpopular decisions.
The new chancellor complained bitterly when his proposals to shake up the
police fell foul of the more cautious instincts of colleagues.
He is more convinced than the party managers that if the government leads
with confidence its supporters can be dragged behind it.
Mr Major's aides have an answer. Even in tranquil times managing a
parliamentary majority of 18 would be difficult after 14 years in
government. Add in Maastricht and the recession and it is obvious that the
prime minister must face up to political realities.
Remember how Mrs Margaret Thatcher backed down over coal privatisation, how
she sacked Mr John Moore for his efforts to cut welfare spending. She had a
majority of more than a 100.
That is all true. So too is the argument that Mr Major's administration
should be compared to the early, indecisive Thatcher years rather than to
those of her unchallenged hegemony of the mid 1980s.
Yet it was obvious yesterday that Mr Lamont had struck a nerve. Too many at
Westminster and in Whitehall admit the sense of drift for it to be dismissed
as the bitterness of a broken politician.
In the words of one of the more astute - and incidentally loyal - of his
ministers: 'If Mr Major is to survive he must demonstrate that he is in
charge of the government, and that the government is in charge of the
country.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fowler in passionate attack against
Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERSONAL attack by Sir Norman Fowler, Tory chairman, on Mr Norman Lamont
yesterday was passionate, finger-jabbing - and encouraged fears among Tory
MPs that much of the party hierarchy is in a nervous panic.
Sir Norman made no attempt to rise above the Westminster fray caused by the
former chancellor's speech, or try to appeal for calm. It was 'frankly
ludicrous,' he said.
Rarely, if ever, have such vitriolic comments been made by one senior
Conservative about another and it was noticeble that Sir Norman was not
joined in his abuse by cabinet members. The prime minister's office said
merely that Sir Norman was expressing his 'personal view'.
One rightwing MP sympathetic to the plight of Mr Lamont said the party
chairman's outburst had been 'appalling'. At the backbench 1922 committee
meeting last night Sir Norman faced further criticism.
Some Tory MPs said the best tactic would have been to be statesmanlike,
refusing to be provoked but merely expressing regret and rebutting calming
Mr Lamont's points.
That was more the approach of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. 'If you sack your
chancellor, you know there will be a price to pay,' said Mr Heseltine. 'It
always was that way; it always will be.'
Mr Howard said the former chancellor's intervention would prove a nine-day
wonder. 'I very much regret that Norman Lamont made the speech,' he added.
The consensus view among Conservative MPs remained that Mr Lamont had less
political weight that Sir Geoffrey Howe, whose resignation speech
precipitated Baroness Thatcher's downfall.
But Sir Norman said Mr Lamont was a man 'thrashing around for culprits for
his own position'. Speaking on GMTV, Sir Norman repeatedly jabbed his finger
at the camera, his face flushing pink. 'It was a dud speech,' he said. 'It
was a nasty speech. And I do not think many people are going to take much
notice of Mr Lamont.'
He said it was 'silly' of Mr Lamont to have suggested in his resignation
speech that the government was living 36 hours at a time.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Battle is rejoined over health
service funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's health managers yesterday reopened the question of how the
National Health Service should be financed with a set of radical ideas that
coincide with the timing of the government's public spending review.
For the first time, the Institute of Health Services Management has
qualified its strong support for retaining the tax-based system of funding
the NHS, saying that 'the limitations of general taxation are increasingly
evident'. Mr David Knowles, the institute's president, told its annual
conference in Birmingham that unelected health authorities lacked 'an
adequate level of legitimacy'. He suggested some health responsibilities
could be transferred to local authorities.
An institute working party examining the future of the NHS, following the
government's 1991 reforms, concluded in a report published yesterday that
funding by general taxation alone placed the service at the mercy of
Whitehall. The institute suggested the possibility of supplementing tax
funding through social insurance, financed by a payroll tax, a dedicated
income tax or local taxation.
The Thatcher government considered many such alternatives in a review
leading to the reforms, but rejected them. Health ministers have no desire
for the public spending review now being undertaken by Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary at the Treasury, to reopen the funding issue - but
continuing spending pressures could do so.
The Department of Health is also conducting a review of NHS structure, which
is due to report next month.
Mr Knowles told the conference that local decisions on health spending
priorities could be achieved only through local democracy.
Before the 1991 reforms health authorities, meeting in public and with some
members nominated by local authorities, looked recognisably like public
bodies.
'Their replacement, however, with smaller, much more managerially focused,
bodies has shifted the balance of their accountability and legitimacy,' Mr
Knowles said.
The Conservative-dominated Commons' health select committee yesterday
recommended that free dental check-ups and routine treatment should be
available to everyone.
This would mean an end to the present charges for services such as check-ups
and X-rays.
The cross-party committee of MPs said patients would have to pay for other
dental work, such as crowns and bridgework, up to a maximum of Pounds 250 as
currently.
People who are exempt from these services would continue to receive them
free of charge, they added.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Consumers 'sceptical of decisions
by ombudsmen'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF the consumers questioned for a report on ombudsmen thought the
decisions they took were unfair, the National Consumer Council said
yesterday.
A third of those asked questioned the independence of the Office of Building
Societies Ombudsmen Scheme and the Insurance Ombudsmen Bureau, the council
said.
The council also reported 'widespread dissatisfaction' with the time taken
to settle disputes.
The average time taken for disputes to be settled was 52 weeks in the case
of the insurance ombudsman and 91 weeks for the building societies
ombudsman.
However, Dr Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, and Mr Stephen Edell,
one of two building societies ombudsmen, protested at the strength of the
council's comments.
Lady Wilcox, who chairs the consumer council, said: 'Our report shows
clearly that ombudsmen provide a cheap and accessible way to resolve
disputes. However, the extent of dissatisfaction revealed in our survey does
show considerable room for improvement.'
The report, based on a sample of just under 1,000 consumers who had used the
ombudsmen schemes, found that 43 per cent of those using the building
society Ombudsman's scheme found it took an 'unreasonably long time to make
a decision'.
Consumers' views about fairness depended largely on whether they had won
their case.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-seat bill published today
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE OF the UK's six extra constituencies for the European parliament -
agreed at the Edinburgh summit - will go to England, and the remaining one
will go to Wales under the arrangements set out in a government bill to be
published today.
The legislation must be passed by October, in order for the new boundaries
to be set in time for the Euro-elections next summer. But the plans are
certain to attract vocal, and perhaps prolonged, opposition because there
will be no extra seat for Scotland.
The bill is scheduled to face all its Commons' stages on Monday.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure mounts over oil tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE yesterday mounted on the government to alter the changes in
petroleum revenue tax announced in the April Budget.
More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow,
former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints
from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of
the government's decision.
In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to
oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total
petroleum revenue tax bill.
The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies
which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE MPs made written representations to past and present Attorneys-generals
concerning former Polly Peck chief Asil Nadir before he jumped bail of
Pounds 3.5m last month and fled to northern Cyprus, the government said last
night.
Attorney-general Sir Nicholas Lyell said in a Commons written reply to Mr
David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, that two MPs had made oral
representations about the case before Mr Nadir left Britain last month.
He did not name the MPs, nor did he reveal the content of their
representations concerning Mr Nadir, who faces charges of fraud and false
accounting involving his business empire.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pounds 500m tax refunds paid to
Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES - individuals whose assets back the insurance market - have
received more than Pounds 500m in tax refunds from the Inland Revenue in the
past two years it emerged last night, Richard Lapper writes.
The Earl of Caithness, a junior minister, said in a Lords written reply that
Pounds 126.7m had been repaid in the 1991-92 tax year and a further Pounds
386.6m in 1992-93.
These figures had been only partially offset by estimated tax income of
Pounds 101.8m and Pounds 10.3m in the same two years.
Names can set aside their Lloyd's losses against tax paid on other income.
Losses for 1990, which the market reports in two weeks' time, are expected
to amount to a record Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 2.8bn, leaving Names with
average losses of more than Pounds 100,000 each.
The government introduced changes earlier this year allowing Names to set
aside greater amounts in tax deductible reserves against future losses. The
change will come into effect for the 1992 underwriting year.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI merger plan for research labs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW National Centre for Environmental Technology is to be formed following
a controversial merger announced by the government yesterday between AEA
Technology and the Warren Spring Labor-atory.
The announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
means that Warren Spring - the country's leading applied environmental
research laboratory, based near Stevenage, Herts - will close. As many as
possible of the 200 scientists will be transferred to AEA Technology's
laboratories at Harwell and Culham in Oxfordshire.
Mr Heseltine said in a Commons written answer that uniting Britain's two
main bases of environmental research would create a single centre of
excellence, but there was strong criticism of the proposal from the Warren
Spring workforce and from the Opposition.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said the closure was a
disaster for the environment. 'The decision will destroy Warren Spring's
independent identity and remove at a stroke a substantial part of its
expertise . . it is clear the exercise is being undertaken purely as a
fattening up preparation for privatisation,' he said.
Mr Joe Magee of the Institution of Professional Managers and Specialists
said the announcement betrayed the government's obligations to the
environment and industry, and broke a pledge to await the outcome of the
review of all five DTI research laboratories.
But Mr Heseltine said the merger would provide a more comprehensive service
and give better value for money.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major taunts Smith with election
'score'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER John Major yesterday brushed aside Labour calls for a general
election as he insisted he was 'getting on with the work in hand.'
Looking more composed after his ordeal on Wednesday at the hands of Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, Mr Major sparked uproar in the chamber
with the robustness of his response.
'You might have overlooked it but we had an election last year,' he told Mr
John Smith, the Labour leader. 'We won it and you lost it. The score is 4-0
in elections recently. In due course it will be 5-0.'
Mr Smith made repeated reference to Mr Lamont's savage resignation statement
as he tried to press home the advantage gained from his own scathing
personal attack on Mr Major's leadership delivered earlier this week.
'Who is better placed to know than the ex-chancellor the weaknesses of this
administration and the weaknesses of you?', he asked.
'Don't you understand the significance of the ex-chancellor's revelations is
that they come from a close political colleague and ally who sat beside you,
right at the heart of government?'
But Mr Major - encouraged by the more supportive mood on the Tory back
benches - declined to be goaded. He had 'no intention' of adding to what Mr
Lamont had said or 'providing you with an opportunity to extend it'. The
Labour leader's references to Mr Lamont's words had been 'very selective'.
With the former chancellor looking on impassively from the back benches, the
prime minister went on to quote one of his predecessors, Harold Macmillan,
saying the government had 'a little local difficulty,' adding 'We will get
over it. I am getting on with the work in hand.'
This prompted Mr Smith to accuse Mr Major of being 'incapable of learning
from anything and anybody.'
The prime minister had 'sent apprehension throughout the land' when he
announced that it was business as usual yesterday morning.
'Since your authority and that of your government is now in tatters, won't
you, for once, put the national interest first and let the people decide in
a general election,' the Labour leader continued. 'Why will you not let the
people decide if they want you and your wretched government?'
Earlier there had been a burst of misplaced anticipation when it emerged
that Mr Archie Hamilton, another minister who left government in last
month's reshuffle, was poised to make a personal statement.
In the event, the former armed forces minister showed impeccable loyalty to
Mr Major - and prompted a cheer from Tory MPs - by proclaiming his intention
to support the government from the back benches.
'I am sure we will see the growth of the economy that we all so fervently
desire and the recognition of all that the prime minister is doing to bring
it about,' Mr Hamilton said.
He said he had asked Mr Major in January if he could leave the government
when it was next reshuffled. 'As a result of the unexpected timing of the
reshuffle I may run the risk that some may think I did not go voluntarily
but was sacked,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory joins attack on VAT reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN WATTS, the Cons-ervative chairman of the Commons Treasury committee,
has joined forces with Labour MPs in criticising government plans to change
the handling of penalties for misdeclaration of value added tax.
A new rule will allow mitigating circumstances to be taken into account by a
VAT tribunal when considering a misdeclaration.
But Mr Watts said the restrictions on the use of mitigation to explain
non-payment were so strict that 'it is difficult to conceive under what
circumstances it could be taken into account'.
Mr Watts, who withheld his support from the government in a vote this week
during discussions on the Finance Bill, said: 'There can be instances where
omission to pay tax is wholly innocent. A VAT tribunal ought to be in a
position to reach that conclusion.'
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool and a member of the Commons
finance committee, said he would consult business organisations and
co-ordinating pressure on the chancellor to look again at the government's
approach to VAT.
According to clause 49 of the Finance Bill, a VAT tribunal is not allowed to
take into consideration three factors:
Inability to pay.
The fact that there has been no actual loss to the Exchequer.
The fact that the liable person was acting in good faith.
Mr Mandelson said not allowing 'good faith' as mitigation was particularly
damaging.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Press and privacy white paper
'soon'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITE paper setting out the government's views on press self-regulation
and invasion of privacy by the media will be published before the end of
next month, Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, announced last night.
He also said that the government remained reluctant to accept the
recommendation by Sir David Calcutt that a statutory press complaints
tri-bunal should be established.
Mr Brooke promised to take into account the strength of support among MPs
for the appointment of a press ombudsman reflected in a debate on a report
by the Commons heritage committee on privacy and media intrusion.
The committee suggested that the ombudsman should be able to adjudicate on
complaints about decisions reached by a new voluntary press commission able
to require newspapers to correct in-accuracies and impose fines.
Newspapers and complainants would be able to appeal to the High Court to
overturn decisions made by the ombudsman.
Mr Gerald Kaufman (Lab Manchester Gorton), chairman of the cross-party
committee, envisaged the ombudsman having a 'back-up' role which provided a
stimulus for voluntary regulation.
He welcomed moves already made by the existing Press Complaints Commission
to give effect to some of the recommendations made by the committee.
Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, said a future Labour government
would order an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the
ownership of the press.
She said: 'When Mr Rupert Murdoch can own 35 per cent of weekday newspaper
circulation that, in the eyes of most people, is a quite unacceptable
concentration of power.'

MR JOHN MAJOR chaired a cabinet committee yesterday on the future of Rosyth
and Devonport dockyards. But the prime minister's office said the prime
minister wanted to talk widely among backbench MPs before reaching a
decision on the award of a vital contract to refit nuclear submarines.
Officials said a lot more work was needed on the costs of the two dockyards
bids before an announcement could be made. The government is also understood
to be looking at ways of softening the impact on jobs for the dockyard that
fails to win.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure mounts over oil tax plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE yesterday mounted on the government to alter the changes in
petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget, Emma Tucker.
More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow,
former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints
from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of
the government's decision.
In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to
oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total
petroleum revenue tax bill.
The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies
which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset.
Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West who attended the meeting, said:
'Our intention is to convince the government that damage is already being
done to all sorts of industries as a result of what is going on.'
During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill Ms Harriet
Harman, shadow Treasury spokesperson, said that the government's claim that
it was helping those on lower incomes by widening the 20 per cent band on
income tax was bogus.
Instead the government was increasing the burden of taxation and hitting the
poor hardest by freezing personal tax allowances and increasing indirect
taxes.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letter 'targets' invalidity benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVALIDITY benefits could become an early casualty of the government's
spending review, according to a confidential government letter leaked
yesterday.
The letter, apparently written to the prime minister from Mr Peter Lilley,
Social Security Secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the two government
ministers spearheading the spending review, proposes a controversial 'three
pronged' course of action to cut invalidity benefits.
This would make invalidity benefit less generous, limited to a smaller group
of long-term sick, and taxable.
Noting that 'these changes are bound to be controversial', the letter
suggests that the climate of opinion has now shifted sufficiently to allow
the measures to gain parliamentary support.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Social Security Secretary, yesterday condemned the
letter, and called on Mr Lilley to 'kill a proposal which is totally
unacceptable' at the earliest opportunity.
According to the letter, the proposed cuts would save Pounds 180m in the
1995-6 financial year, Pounds 495m in the following year, and Pounds 1.3bn
by the end of the decade.
The bulk of this saving would be made through the introduction of stricter
medical controls on claimants, which the letter suggests would save Pounds
240m over the next three years.
Savings could also be made, the letter suggests, by phasing out the payment
of additional pension, on top of invalidity benefits.
The letter says cuts are necessary because of a 'dramatic growth in
invalidity benefit', as the number of claimants between 1978 and the present
has risen from 600,000 to 1.5m, and total expenditure grown from Pounds 840m
to Pounds 6.2bn, with a projected rise to Pounds 8.2bn in 1995.

A FUTURE Labour govern-ment would order an inquiry by the Monopolies and
Mergers commission into the ownership of the press, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow
heritage secretary, told the Commons last night.
She said: 'When Mr Rupert Murdoch can own 35 per cent of weekday newspaper

Ms Clwyd also complained that Mr Murdoch's acolytes were now arguing that he
should be allowed to take over large tracts of British television.
She said a Labour government would look at ways of bringing more diversity
to local, regional and national newspapers.
During a debate on the Commons heritage committee report on media intrusion,
Ms Clwyd joined MPs from both sides of the House in opposing statutory
regulation of the press.
Mr Gerald Kaufman (Lab Manchester Gorton), chairman of the committee, and Mr
Paul Channon, the former Conservative cabinet minister, were among leading
members of the committee who urged the government to appoint an ombudsman to
deal with complaints not satisfactorily resolved by a voluntary press
commission.
Mr Kaufman envisaged the ombudsman having a 'back-up' role which provided a
stimulus for voluntary regulation.
He welcomed moves already made by the existing Press Complaints Commission
to give effect to some of the recommendations made by the heritage
committee.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard firmly opposed to
independent bank move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, the right-wing Home Secretary, yesterday made clear his
opposition to an independent central bank in Britain - as proposed by Mr
Norman Lamont in his resignation speech.
Mr Howard went out of his way to make clear that a central bank without
parliamentary accountability would be unacceptable to many on the Tory right
wing - particularly if such proposals were set as part of any moves towards
European economic and monetary union.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Howard said there was no requirement in the
Maastricht treaty for Britain to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism
and the government had negotiated an opt-out on Emu.
'We are not obliged to follow that route. It remains to be see when the
crunch comes whether many of our European partners want to follow that
route,' Mr Howard said.
Downing Street said Mr John Major believed an independent central bank would
have advantages in the battle against inflation and he had discussed such a
possibility when Mr Lamont was chancellor.
But officials said Mr Major was also worried about the lack of parliamentary
accountability and they suggested that the extra advantages of independence
would quickly dilute as any measure of accountability was injected.
Downing Street said no proposals for an independent central bank were being
actively considered in Whitehall. Lord (formerly Mr Nigel) Lawson, former
chancellor, and many senior Tory backbenchers have called for the Bank of
England to be made independent.
Mr Howard said: 'There seems to be something about the Treasury that if
ministers spend a long time there, as Nigel Lawson and Norman Lamont did,
they appear to come to the conclusion that the best solution to our problems
is to hand them over to someone else, to an independent central bank not
democratically elected.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Moaning minnies find a sympathetic
ear - The objectives of the newly launched Complaints Task Force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITIZEN'S Charter has found a new ally in the struggle to raise the
quality of the UK's public services - the whingeing Pom.
For generations the great British moaner has been an object of ridicule and
even the target of a wartime advertising campaign, Don't Be A Moaning
Minnie.
Top of the list for the professional grouser are public services such as
British Rail and the privatised utilities including British
Telecommunications. The Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit wants them to
use consumer complaints to improve services.
Mr David Davis, the junior public service minister, said yesterday:
'Complaints are a valuable management tool in identifying weak areas in
service provision.'
He was launching a Complaints Task Force to help the public services improve
their handling of disgruntled customers.
An earlier task force set sail to the south Atlantic to liberate the
Falkland Islands from the Argentinian invader. This task force also has a
hard mission - to come up with the perfect complaints system.
Mr Davis said people in the public services should not be defensive about
complaints but should see them as an opportunity to improve themselves. He
should know. After complaints about the chancellor's management of the
economy he was promoted in the recent cabinet reshuffle from junior whip to
his new post as Lord Whitelaw's deputy. He has already been tipped as a
future prime minister.
It is a far cry from Mrs Thatcher's heyday, when Mr Bernard Ingham, then No
10's irascible press supremo, used to lambast the moaning minnies who
complained about unpopular government decisions. He once memorably likened
Lord Pym, then lord president, to Mona Lott for expressing mild dissidence.
The Citizen's Charter Unit helpfully provided examples of how responding
positively to complaints had improved particular services. The Employment
Service had redesigned its offices so that 'customers' (the unemployed)
could enjoy more privacy during interviews with staff. This was in response
to complaints from the customers that other people were listening in when
they were discussing their personal details.
How had the complaint been identified? By listening in on the customers, of
course. Lady Wilcox, the businesswoman who has been making waves at the
National Consumer Council, will command the new task force. She will lead a
six-person team of ombudspeople and customer service specialists in drawing
up a whinger's charter.
She wants to make sure that the Citizen's Charter is about more than being
'fobbed off with a fiver' when things go wrong.
'People want to know that their complaints will lead to the service being
improved,' she said.
She may, however, be misjudging why the British are so fond of complaining.
As Mona Lott used to say: 'It's being so miserable as keeps us going.'

<TEXT>
MR Mark Thatcher, son of the former British prime minister, is being asked
to hand over to a US court any documents or information in his possession
connecting him to international arms dealers.
Lawyers acting for six defendants in a libel suit in Houston, Texas, have
filed a subpoena against Mr Thatcher.
If the subpoena is upheld by Judge Dan Downey sitting on the case, Mr
Thatcher would have to reveal - probably in late July or early September -
any involvement he or his company had with Middle Eastern arms deals.
The six defendants are being accused of libel by the three sons of late
businessman Ihsan Barbouti, an alleged arms dealer to Iraq and designer of a
chemicals weapon plant at Rabta, Libya.
The defendants believe Mr Thatcher may have information helpful to their
case.
The defendants, in turn, claim they were defrauded by Barbouti and
unwittingly involved in an illegal export scheme.
They are counter-suing the Barboutis, and have unsuccessfully tried to
subpoena ex-President George Bush.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S tax department yesterday said it was investigating allegations
that a state-owned company had evaded taxes on a large scale.
Mr Carlos Tacchi, revenues secretary, yesterday confirmed the department was
investigating claims that the company, Edcadassa, had used fake receipts to
evade the equivalent of Dollars 1.5m in tax since 1990. The company is 51
per cent-owned by the defence ministry.
Mr Erman Gonzalez resigned two months ago as defence minister to lead the
ruling Peronist party's congressional election campaign in Buenos Aires,
where corruption is a leading issue. The elections are due in October and
the affair could offer new ammunition to the opposition.
Edcadassa holds, at Buenos Aires international airport, a monopoly over
bonded warehouses which the defence ministry has been under pressure from
the US embassy and the economy ministry to break.
President Bill Clinton is expected to mention Edcadassa's monopoly, and US
suspicion of corruption and drug smuggling at the airport, when he meets
Argentine President Carlos Menem in Washington on June 29.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Breyer in strong challenge: US Supreme Court Vacancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is thought to be leaning towards Judge Stephen Breyer
of Massachusetts to fill the vacancy on the US Supreme Court.
The only semi-official word from the White House is the president is
considering a short list of two, Judge Breyer and Mr Bruce Babbitt, the
interior secretary who had appeared the favoured choice earlier.
The prospective removal of Mr Babbitt from the cabinet has upset
environmentalists, who rate him highly, Republicans, who think the choice
would be too 'political', and some of Mr Clinton's own advisers, who cannot
see the point of entertaining a confirmation battle for a new interior
secretary.
The president's stated criteria for a new justice are broad legal
experience, preferably elective office, and 'a big heart'.
He is also inclined towards someone he knows personally. Mr Babbitt, former
attorney-general and governor of Arizona, fits this bill.
Judge Breyer, recovering from a road accident, is in many respects Mr
Babbitt's opposite, though both graduated from Harvard law school.
Appointed to the federal bench by President Carter, he is, at 54, chief
federal appeals court judge for the circuit based in Boston and has spent
most of his life in academia and the law.
He has good political connections, most obviously with the Kennedy family,
and a solid legal reputation as an intellectual, pragmatic jurist sufficient
to have won the approval of some Republican senators.
Judge Breyer has placed his legal stamp on sentencing guidelines, airline
deregulation, fair housing and freedom of the press. If nominated and
confirmed, he would be the first Jew to serve on the court since Justice Abe
Fortas resigned in 1969.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Anti-establishment mood hits Democrats: Off-year US
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are usually thin, but interesting, political pickings in off-year US
elections. Typically the incumbent in the White House, new or old, suffers
setbacks, but local rather than national personalities and circumstances
tend to predominate.
But even this caveat cannot disguise the fact this year's returns are
already proving worrying to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic party,
as they contemplate defence of their House and Senate majorities next year.
From California to New Jersey the anti-establishment mood of the country
seems as strong as ever and the Democrats, under a president whose own
popularity has been sinking alarmingly, now constitute the larger part of
that establishment.
In Los Angeles, the new mayor is Richard Riordan, a Republican in the Ross
Perot image, victor over Michael Woo, the Democrat embraced by Mr Clinton.
There is a new Republican senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and a
strong Republican challenger, Christine Whitman, for Governor Jim Florio's
hold on New Jersey.
Two solid Democratic House seats - those formerly occupied in Wisconsin by
Les Aspin, now defence secretary, and in California by Leon Panetta, budget
director - have been retained but with sharply reduced majorities. In
Virginia, a very conservative Republican gubernatorial candidate is making
waves, as is one-time Colonel Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, who is
eyeing a senate run next year.
The Democratic defence lies mostly in local explanations, which certainly
have some validity in Los Angeles and Texas. There is both interest and
concern in whether Mr Riordan, a political novice, can apply business
techniques successfully to make his troubled city feel and work better than
decades of political management have. If he does, then the broader
anti-establishment cause represented by Mr Perot may take further flight.
In Texas, it hurts the Democrats to have their state establishment, under
Governor Ann Richards, so rebuffed and for their US senate majority to have
dropped by one to 54-46. But at least they take consolation in the fact that
Bob Krueger, the interim senator filling in for Lloyd Bensten, now treasury
secretary, was not only a terrible candidate but also almost always voted
against the president in any case and was rewarded with no presidential
assistance.
The more representative contests to come this year are the governor races in
New Jersey and Virginia. The campaigns of both Ms Whitman, who nearly upset
Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, and Governor Florio are being managed by two
heavyweight strategists, with Ed Rollins, the Republican guru who briefly
worked for Mr Perot last year, in the Whitman corner, and James Carville,
the Clinton electoral mastermind, advising Mr Florio.
The governor has recovered remarkably from the pits of unpopularity brought
on by his introduction of sharp tax increases, while Ms Whitman had a
tougher than expected primary this week. Mr Rollins wants to make the
contest a referendum on the Clinton administration, of which he considers Mr
Florio a precursor. Polls show the two running evenly.
More surprising, one survey showed a similar result in Virginia where George
Allen, a conservative Republican, and Mary Sue Terry, a moderate Democrat,
are bidding to succeed Governor Doug Wilder, who cannot run for another
term.
George Allen is a revered name in Washington and its populous Virginia
suburbs, because 20-plus years ago the candidate's eponymous father was the
coach who turned the hapless Redskins into a winning football team. But even
this illustrious association had seemed less important than the fact that
Virginian politics, no longer the fiefdom of reactionary Democratic families
and reflecting suburban values, have become much more moderate, as witnessed
by the election of Governor Wilder, who is black.
Virginia's national importance is that it is the next big electoral test of
the power of the religious right, which last weekend dominated the
Republican convention in Richmond that nominated Mr Allen. It rapturously
welcomed Mr North, especially his endorsement of the long-standing
ultra-conservative demand that English be made the only official language in
the US.
Most local pundits still think that Ms Terry, a former state attorney
general, should beat Mr Allen in the autumn if the fractious Democrats get
out the vote. But it is conceivable that next year Mr North could profit
from the bitter personal hostility between Mr Wilder, a likely senate
candidate, and Mr Chuck Robb, the sitting Democratic senator.
The worst blow for the Democrats and Mr Clinton would be victories for Mr
Allen and Ms Whitman. They would instantly be compared with the stunning
Democratic triumph by Mr Harris Wofford in the Pennsylvania senate special
election in 1991, a result that marked the beginning of the end for
President George Bush. Mr Clinton has troubles enough already.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Failure on market access could 'sink' Gatt
round - David Gardner and Tim Coone interview Peter Sutherland, the newly
appointed chief of Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE to reach a market access agreement at next month's Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo could sink prospects of concluding the Uruguay Round world
trade reform negotiations, according to Mr Peter Sutherland, the newly
appointed director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
'If there is a failure to deliver (in Tokyo), then I think we have a serious
crisis,' Mr Sutherland said yesterday.
Strong leadership and tough decisions by the US and European Community would
be required if Gatt's Uruguay Round were to be successfully concluded by its
December 15 deadline, he said.
A former EC competition commissioner from 1985 to 1989, who built up a
formidable reputation for overcoming resistance from government ministers
and powerful industrial lobby groups in breaking down internal EC trade
barriers, Mr Sutherland now sees the responsibility for the task of breaking
down world trade barriers as lying firmly with the industrialised nations.
'An enormous responsibility rests with the G7 countries to re-ignite the
process, which will then have to be rapidly multi-lateralised. We must look
to the EC and the US as essential players and we are very fortunate in
having Mickey Kantor (the US trade representative) and Leon Brittan (the EC
trade commissioner) who are both committed to completing the Uruguay Round,
but leadership will have to come from the highest levels. Difficult
decisions will have to be taken,' he said.
It will be of vital importance that progress is made over the next two
months if the Uruguay Round is to be completed, he said.
'There has to be progress in the short term. Without progress this side of
August, it will be difficult to complete the round by the December
deadline.' He said that the G7 meeting in Tokyo next month would be the key
to this, and he expected advances to be made there on market access.
'A solution to the Uruguay Round is going to require a recognition of
legitimate interests, particularly those of the developing world, which have
to be taken into account by the developed world,' he said.
'The multilateral negotiating system is on trial and so is facing a very
dangerous time. There has to be a recognition that the blow to confidence
that would result from a failure of the round would be global and that
strength in negotiations does not depend on the ability to point a figure at
who is to blame.'
Looking beyond the Uruguay Round, which he says is the sine qua non for
Gatt's future development into a more powerful multilateral trade
organisation proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the outgoing director-general, Mr
Sutherland believes that in the short-term the Gatt secretariat must have
additional resources for 'organic growth to develop its overall competence
to monitor and analyse competition issues in world trade'.
There was a need for a speedier resolution of disputes, he said, and the
functioning of the various trade panels 'has to become more effective, and
should not become paralysed by the need for unanimity'.
In a tribute to Mr Dunkel, whom he will replace on July 1, he said: 'He has
been an exceptional public servant, who has delivered us to the stage which
allows (the Uruguay Round) to be completed.'
But he warned that the various statements from around the world of
willingness to complete the round 'should not be taken as proof that we are
irreversibly on course to concluding the round. We have had various false
dawns before and we are faced with a very short time frame to conclude the
negotiations'.
Should the unthinkable happen and the Uruguay round fail 'it will still be
vital that Gatt itself continues. Otherwise the world will revert to a group
of warring trading blocks.'
Mr Sutherland, told the FT he was 'not pessimistic, but I'm realistic' about
the chances of a deal in Tokyo and concluding the round by its December 15
deadline.
Hopes have been raised in recent weeks that the US, EC, Japan and Canada can
reach binding agreements on cutting tariffs on manufactured goods and the
liberalisation of services at Tokyo. But the evidence was 'not yet there to
justify optimism over conclusion,' he said. 'We've had too many false
dawns.'
Mr Sutherland, who does not take over at Gatt until July 1, would not
confirm that he will be at the Tokyo summit. Nor was he prepared to comment
yet on French opposition to the EC-US agreement on the farm chapter of the
Round, negotiated at Blair House in Washington last November by his
successor in Brussels as Ireland's commissioner, Mr Ray MacSharry.
'It seems to me that Blair House is the basis, and will remain the basis for
discussions leading to the conclusion of the Round,' Mr Sutherland said. He
did not believe the Gatt talks would collapse over agriculture. 'I still
believe that will be solved,' he said.
The former commissioner, who played a leading part in designing the EC's
single market programme, made very clear that he would take a hard line
against any country obstructing progress towards a world trade deal.
'I see my role as a political role, where I'm going to say it as it is, and,
I hope, bluntly face negotiating parties with their responsibilities.'
Gatt, he said, and by implication the multilateral trade organisation which
could succeed it, could and should become 'a major organisation in world
governance.'

<TEXT>
JAPAN and the US will need more than one meeting before agreeing on a new
framework to govern their economic relations, one of the Japanese
negotiators said yesterday.
Speaking shortly before his departure for preliminary talks in Washington,
Mr Koichiro Matsuura, deputy minister for foreign affairs, told visiting
journalists there was a big divergence of views between the two sides, and
that it was difficult to see what kind of agreement could be reached.
Rejecting US demands for numerical targets to reduce Japan's current account
balance of payments surplus, Mr Matsuura said that Japan did not regard its
voluntary restrictions for car exports to the European Community - or the
semiconductor agreement encouraging US producers to take 20 per cent of the
Japanese market - as desirable precedents for regulating trade.
He said voluntary export curbs were not in accordance with the goal of the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, which the leading industrial
countries have promised to complete by the end of this year.
The Japanese government now regards the semiconductor agreement as a bad
precedent which should never be repeated, he added.
However, there have been signs from Washington that a softer line towards
numerically managed trade is being adopted, as part of attempts to make
progress towards a US-Japan agreement.
Mr Matsuura will be accompanied, at the talks today in Washington, by Mr
Tadeo Chino, deputy minister for international affairs at the Japanese
ministry of finance, and by Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, deputy minister for
international affairs at the ministry for international trade and industry.

Mr Maynard Jackson, the mayor of Atlanta, has announced he will not seek a
fourth term for 'compelling personal reasons', Barbara Harrison writes from
Atlanta. The popular Mr Jackson, who recovered from heart surgery last year,
had been considered unbeatable in the election in October. Being without an
heir apparent, he leaves the political field open. Atlanta is solidly
Democratic and unlikely to change.
Mr Jackson, who in 1973 became the first black mayor of a large US southern
city, served the limit of two consecutive terms, then returned after Mr
Andrew Young, former US ambassador to the United Nations, had served two
terms. The biggest challenge facing the next mayor will be preparing to host
the 1996 Olympic Games.

talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, yesterday called for caution in
the Uruguay round market access negotiations and singled out
labour-intensive industries for special treatment.
In a rare personal presentation to the European Commission, Mr Balladur said
that the high rate of unemployment in Europe meant that EC customs duties on
textiles, aluminium, steel and chemicals should be gradual and accompanied
by strengthened Gatt disciplines.
The French prime minister also repeated that the US-EC agreement last year
on farm export subsidies, known as the Blair House agreement, was
unacceptable in its present form. EC officials had been braced for the
ritual denunciation of Blair House, but Mr Balladur's remarks on market
access were viewed as potentially troublesome.
One senior EC official said it showed that France intends to keep Sir Leon
Brittan, the Commission's chief trade negotiator, on a tight leash as market
access negotiations by the EC, US, Japan and Canada enter a critical stage.
Sir Leon, however, remained unruffled. 'Nothing has changed. The Commission
thinks the Blair House agreement is a good agreement and we should stick to
it.' He added that all sides agreed on the need to make progress in the
Uruguay Round and to advance rapidly to an ambitious market access package
for goods and services.
The aim was an outline agreement at the G7 industrialised nations' summit in
Tokyo next month. Talks would return to agriculture only at a later stage,
he said.
Mr Balladur's visit to Brussels was seen as a chance for the prime minister
to let off steam on trade, two days after France had quietly agreed to
ratify the EC-US agreement on oilseeds, a vital building block for an
overall deal in the Uruguay Round negotiations.
In his speech to the Commission, Mr Balladur said that trade reform should
aim at opening protected markets in high-growth zones of Latin America and
south-east Asia.
Europe must not be exposed to stiffer competition from countries which had
weak social security and lax environmental safeguards, or those which
engaged in deliberate currency depreciation in order to expand export
markets.
Mr Luc Guyau - president of the main French farmers' union, FNSEA, also in
Brussels yesterday - welcomed Mr Balladur's rejection of the Blair House
accord.
'If necessary, (French) farmers will take to the streets to make our
European partners understand we won't capitulate to the Americans,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Washington focuses on six difficult
sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX sectors are emerging as the US focus in tough US-Japan trade talks, to
begin in Washington today, along with a general conviction that Japan must
be brought to make a serious commitment to reduce its overall current
account surplus.
The six sectors, comprising 65 per cent of Japanese exports to the US, are:
cars, car parts, computers, supercomputers, electronics and semiconductors.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, noted these are the areas where
US companies have had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market, despite
many previous negotiations and agreements.
The lone exception seems to be semiconductors, where the Japanese last year
surprised everyone by surpassing an agreed 20 per cent target for foreign
penetration. This brought the Clinton administration to a view that
'results-oriented (pacts) work'.
A target of sorts was agreed for the US auto parts sector last year, during
President George Bush's ill-fated trip to Tokyo.
The deal included a commitment by Japanese automakers to more than double
their purchases of US-made car parts to Dollars 19bn by 1994.
Real progress on cars and car parts is considered vital. Of the Dollars 50bn
US trade deficit with Japan, vehicles and vehicle parts account for Dollars
30bn. About Dollars 10bn of of that is car parts. In the US, American parts
companies have been losing business while Japanese car transplants buy from
Japanese parts transplants.
This may have begun to change. Toyota has increased its purchases of parts
in the US by 40 per cent, Nissan by 60 per cent.
Mr Kantor has acknowledged that the Japanese 'have opened it to some degree
with the transplants.' Purchases are running at about Dollars 12-13bn a
year.
However, US Commerce Department figures do not distinguish between purchases
from US parts-makers and Japanese transplants. 'We were supposed to have a
concentration on traditional (American) US auto parts suppliers,' Mr Kantor
said, 'and we believe that has not taken place to the degree that it
should.'
The US also will want to go past numerical considerations and on to
examining Japanese competition policy of the sort which keeps out foreign
car dealers.

THE US yesterday pressed North Korea again to reverse its decision to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but apparently without
success.
After face-to-face talks all day, the two sides agreed to resume
negotiations today in what will be, for the Americans, a last-ditch effort.
Pyongyang's withdrawal from the pact is due to go into effect tomorrow.
Mr Robert Galucci, US assistant secretary of state, discussed the problem at
the offices of the US mission to the UN with Mr Kang Sok Chu, North Korean
vice-minister for foreign affairs. Afterwards, Mr Galucci reported to the
representatives of Britain, France, China and Japan on the results of the
meeting.
After two sessions last week, he had recorded 'no significant progress'. It
was not clear whether the agreement to hold a fourth meeting today might
mean there was at least some hope North Korea would delay its withdrawal.
Although the meetings are not under UN auspices, the US has the backing of a
Security Council resolution, of May 11, that called on North Korea to
reconsider and to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency in
its verification programme.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Roche announces new treatment for Aids
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRELIMINARY data presented on a new Aids treatment developed by Roche of
Switzerland suggest it is almost as effective as Wellcome's AZT, and is more
effective than AZT when the two medicines are used in combination.
Roche's drug, code-named Ro-31-8959, is a protease inhibitor which affects
production of an enzyme necessary for the Aids virus, HIV, to replicate
effectively. Virus particles without the enzyme appear to be malformed and
non-infectious.
Three studies in Italy, France, and the UK, involving nearly 200 patients,
showed the drug led to significant increases in CD4 cells, the immune cells
attacked by the Aids virus. This was true in patients in early and late
stages of the disease. Clinicians from all three studies said the drug was
extremely well tolerated at effective doses.
The results brought some relief to the annual international Aids conference
in Berlin, where they were unveiled. Data presented earlier this week from a
UK-French study of AZT, the most widespread treatment for Aids, had
confirmed earlier suggestions that the drug was not useful in HIV-positive
patients who had not yet developed symptoms.
The Italian study, involving 96 patients, compared AZT on its own against
AZT with the protease inhibitor (at three different doses), and the protease
inhibitor on its own. It showed Ro-31-8959 monotherapy at 600mg was almost
as good as AZT on its own. But, when combined with AZT at 600mg, there was a
significant increase in the CD4 count.

A NIGERIAN high court yesterday ordered the National Electoral Commission
not to hold tomorrow's presidential election until it heard a suit filed by
a group calling for extended military rule, Reuter reports from Abuja.
'I hereby issue an order restraining NEC from conducting the presidential
election on June 12 pending the determination of the substantive suit,'
Justice Bassey Ikpeme told the court in Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital.
Justice Ikpeme gave the ruling after hearing an application for an interim
injunction from the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN).
The ABN is asking the court to make President Ibrahim Babangida extend his
rule until 1997, saying that civilian politicians are not ready to govern
Africa's most populous nation.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Iran set to choose president it knows: Why Rafsanjani is a
certain victor in an election today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the few certainties in Iran is that Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
will continue to be president after elections today.
Of the 128 people who applied to oppose him, only three were approved as
candidates. Two of them are good friends of his and the other is a former
member of parliament who has of late failed to win re-election. Of the
three, Mr Ahmad Tavakkoli, a former minister and economics editor of the
Resalat newspaper, which represents the interests of bazaar merchants, has
appeared the most credible challenger.
A former labour minister and government spokesman in the post-revolutionary
cabinet of Mr Bani Sadr, now exiled in Paris, he has been a leading critic
of the slow pace of reforms aimed at introducing a free-market economy.
Even so, Mr Tavakkoli's attacks have been aimed more at members of the
fourth parliament elected since the revolution than at Mr Rafsanjani.
The second candidate, Mr Abdullah Jasbi, chancellor of the Azad University
(Islamic Open University), owes his survival in the post to Mr Rafsanjani.
The university is Mr Rafsanjani's brainchild, even if it produces graduates
with degrees that few employers accept. Mr Jasbi has appeared understandably
reluctant to bite the hand that feeds him.
Mr Rajabali Taheri, the failed Majlis candidate, is very much an also-ran.
This triumvirate has also bolstered the impression that there were no more
substantial challengers to Mr Rafsanjani. A shattered economy, a fragmented
domestic opposition and an ineffective exiled alternative, have left the
people with one option: the president they know.
Yet, only a year ago, President Rafsanjani was the hope of the nation.
Merchants saw him as source of new income, industry liked to believe that
foreign investment would pour in once the left was eliminated, and the
ordinary man (and especially the woman) looked forward to an easing of the
draconian social restrictions that ruled their every movement.
Instead, the recent partial unification of the exchange rate has increased
inflation. During the past two years the market has been flooded with
foreign goods, often imported at unrealistic exchange rates, with the result
that many foreign products were cheaper in Iran than in the country of
origin. The bazaar flourished but inflation remained the biggest cause of
discontent.
The irony is that the more economic conditions have deteriorated, the less
likely it has become that Mr Rafsanjani would be be deposed. The left, which
believes in a controlled economy, needed a complete collapse of the system
as proof that Mr Rafsanjani's policies were not working.
The riots last summer in five cities caused alarm among the clerics,
especially in the camp of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, who
blamed the trouble on the pace of reform. Opposition to the president from
above has in turn partially paralysed the government and its reforms.
One effect will be to force Mr Rafsanjani to compromise on the composition
of his next cabinet. Speculation centres on the vice-presidency which is not
an elected post. Mr Hassan Habibi, a Rafsanjani protege, is likely to depart
and may be replaced by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister.
Although Mr Rafsanjani is certain to win today, his longer-term survival
must still depend of his ability to turn the economy around. The exercise of
the regime's particular form of democracy matters less to the public than
economic benefits and greater social freedom.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Tokyo divided on whether downturn is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE argument over whether the two-year downturn in the Japanese economy
has come to an end has broken out among the highest ranks of the Japanese
government. The debate comes after a senior economic minister yesterday
announced the recession had bottomed out.
Mr Hajime Funada, the minister in charge of the Economic Planning Agency,
one of the weakest ministries in the Tokyo pecking order, delivered the
assessment to a monthly ministerial meeting to assess the economic outlook.
Mr Funada said: 'After carefully observing economic movements I am sure that
the economy has hit bottom.' For the last three months the EPA's diffusion
index of economic indicators has suggested the economy is recovering.
Mr Funada's assessment provoked a sharp rebuke from the powerful Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (Miti) which believes it is too early to
say the recession has reached its trough. Miti's position is supported by
senior bankers, industrialists and retailers.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, Miti's vice minister, emphasised there was no consensus
within the government over the state of the economy. He said Miti believed
the bottom of the recession was at least two or three months away.
The EPA alleges that Miti is more pessimistic simply because the business
lobbies which the industry ministry represents want to maintain pressure on
the government for further public spending to boost the economy.
For their part Miti officials dismiss the EPA's forecasts because the agency
persistently underestimated the scale and intensity of the downturn.
The Bank of Japan, which is cautious about prospects for recovery, will
weigh into the debate today with its closely watched quarterly survey of the
state of the economy.
The dispute within the government, which has been joined by industrialists
and bankers, reflects a widespread belief that the next few weeks will mark
a critical period, as the Y24,000bn (Pounds 146.8bn) the government has
pumped into the economy over the past year in emergency spending measures
feeds through into the private sector.
Business leaders generally back Miti's stance. Mr Masami Tachikawa, chairman
of the trust companies association, said still stagnant consumer spending
meant that 'nobody can say the economy is set for a smooth recovery.'
Mr Isao Nakauchi, Daiei department store chain president, said: 'As far as
personal consumption is concerned it can hardly be said that the domestic
economy has hit bottom.'

<DATELINE>
   RANGOON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BURMESE have been told by their military government that it will never hand
over power to a civilian government popularly elected in 1990.
Lt Gen Myo Nyunt, chairman of the military-convened National Convention
Commission, told a plenary session of the convention only that the regime
would be willing to share power on terms designed to preserve the military's
dominant role in national politics.
And power-sharing in this manner is to be enshrined as a fundamental and
permanent principle in a new constitution now being drawn up. Some 700
convention delegates will begin discussions today on the 'fundamental
principles of state' to be written into the constitution.
The general has proposed a presidential form of government where actual
power is wielded, not by the prime minister elected by parliament, but by an
executive president chosen by an electoral college. He has also suggested
that the president should be experienced in military as well as political,
economic and administrative affairs.
Acceptance of this suggestion as a constitutional principle would mean that
no one without military experience could be elected president.
The new constitution will also provide for a parliament of two chambers, but
as proposed by the chairman, the legislators will not be limited to those
elected by popular vote but include a certain number (to be specified later)
of those nominated by the defence service commander-in-chief, presumably
from among military personnel.
No mention was made of the basis on which the prime minister should be
elected and on his role is vis-a-vis the president. But it is conceivable
that only a nominated military member of parliament, or a civilian elected
MP acceptable to and supported by military MPs, would be elected as prime
minister.
In the executive branch of the government, some posts would be reserved for
military officers, with the defence services commander-in-chief having
virtually unfettered powers in times of emergency.

MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, is expected to emerge from more than six
weeks out of the public eye to receive Mr Mahathir Mohammed, Malaysian prime
minister, expected in Beijing at the weekend, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
Mr Li, aged 65, who has been variously reported to have suffered from a
heart attack or to have contracted a bad cold, has not been sighted since he
abruptly cancelled an appointment to receive President Fidel Ramos of the
Philippines on April 26.
Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters yesterday:
'Premier Li Peng is doing very well in his recovery and he will receive
Prime Minister Mahathir personally.'
Mr Li's lengthy absence from public view has fuelled speculation about his
political well-being and has also enabled leadership rivals to assume a
higher profile.
He is blamed by many Chinese for ordering the crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen square in 1989 that ended in massacre.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Hun Sen warns of Cambodia break-up soon
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULING Cambodian People's party, alleging that the election it lost last
month was marked by widespread corruption, warned yesterday that the country
could break up.
Mr Hun Sen, prime minister, told political leaders that moves are already
under way to establish an autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia.
United Nations officials have so far dismissed the warning as a political
bluff. Mr Eric Falt, the spokesman for the UN Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac), commented that 'at this stage we have no evidence that any
province is dissociating itself from the rest of Cambodia.' Mr Yasushi
Akashi, the head of Untac, added that 'Cambodia is already small enough.'
At yesterday's meeting Mr Hun Sen also repeated his party's complaints about
the conduct of the election and warned that his party would not hand over
power to Funcinpec, the royalist party which came first in the polls, unless
these allegations are fully investigated.
'Until the many outstanding issues concerning the elections are resolved,
the current government will stay in place,' he said. The party has submitted
a list of technical complaints about the electoral process, none of which
would make much difference to the result of the election. Talks involving
the CPP and Funcinpec on a possible coalition are going on at the royal
palace.
Mr Akashi has told the party that he is totally satisfied with the conduct
of the election. In a letter sent to the party president he said there was
no question of starting a new investigation to the charges of electoral
fraud. Mr Akashi also rejected the CPP's other main demand, that new
elections be held in at least five provinces.
Final results announced by Untac yesterday give Funcinpec 58 seats in the
new constituent assembly and the CPP 51 seats. Two smaller parties will
share the remaining 11 seats.
The assembly is due to meet for the first time on Monday and begin its task
of drafting a new constitution. After that it would become a legislative
body.
Mr Hun Sen's threat of a new autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia was widely
seen as a political gambit and as part of coalition negotiations, although
it was extremely well orchestrated. As he was speaking several hundred
people gathered in three eastern provinces to voice their opposition to the
election results. Most of the demonstrators were government employees.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Asians challenge west on human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFRONTATION is looming between the west and Asia on human rights.
Next week a United Nations world conference on human rights - only the
second of its kind since the second world war - opens in Vienna.
Several Asian governments say they intend using the conference to expose
what they consider to be western hypocrisy and selectivity on human rights
questions. In particular they seem intent on confronting a new US
administration which they feel is intent on increasingly linking human
rights and trade and aid issues.
Malaysia and Singapore have been making the running in articulating the
so-called Asian approach to human rights questions. This encompasses two
main elements:
Cultural relativism. While accepting certain basic human rights, such as the
right against arbitrary killing and torture, human rights should also
reflect local cultural and historical factors.
Singapore officials accuse the west of arrogantly imposing its concepts of
human rights on the rest of the world. They say the west's smugness must be
punctured and contradictions of its position exposed. Asia must have a
different approach: it should carefully sift through western inspired ideas
on human rights to find elements acceptable in the local context.
Malaysia says it will not accept finger wagging by the west. 'Each country
is entitled to its own perception of human rights and forcing developing
countries to follow the western perception is unfair and unjust,' says Mr
Musa Hitam, a leader of the Malaysian delegation to the conference.
Economic development. This emphasises that human rights cannot be divorced
from economic development. At a conference in Bangkok earlier this year
Asian countries signed a declaration saying economic development was 'a
universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human
rights'.
'Malaysia views development as very basic to human rights,' says Mr Musa.
'Civil and political rights should come almost automatically after
development has been achieved.'
Both these ideas are likely to come under fire in Vienna. Human rights
groups dispute that there is a consensus among Asian countries on the issue:
for instance, they say, Japan differed radically with China on human rights
at the Bangkok conference.
Ms Sidney Jones, of the human rights body Asia Watch, says human rights must
be seen as an international issue. 'If governments and their security forces
are primarily responsible for human rights abuses, it is illusory to think
that the same governments are best equipped to protect human rights ..the
only possible way ..is to acknowledge from the outset that responsibility
for protection transcends national boundaries.'
Amnesty International accuses governments in Asia of condemning the Vienna
conference to failure. Mr Pierre Sane, Amnesty's secretary general, says
many governments in Asia consider international protection and monitoring of
human rights as interference and an attempt by the west to cut their
competitiveness.
'What is at stake here is the rights of the workers in Asia,' says Mr Sane.
'If they are respected, products coming from Asia will be more expensive.
And therefore the economic competitiveness of countries like China,
Indonesia, Malaysia - the new and emerging tigers - will be threatened.
'It is a very linear concept of development whereby you fill the bellies
first, and then you provide people with freedom,' says Mr Sane. 'Maybe 100
years ago the universal consciousness could accept that to industrialise you
crush a whole generation. But it is not acceptable in 1993.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Pakistan faces big budget hole: Farhan Bokhari looks at the
country's revenue and spending books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S looming cash crunch and fears of slower growth are worrying
policy makers as the country prepares for its annual budget on Monday.
The fiscal year ending this month is expected to close with one of the
highest budget deficits in Pakistan's history. That is expected to be around
Rs100bn (Pounds 2.5bn) or over 7 per cent of gross domestic product, up from
an earlier projection of Rs65bn or 5 per cent of GDP.
According to government estimates, annual growth is expected to drop to just
under 4 per cent, down from a target of over 6 per cent. In large part, the
fall has been caused by a nearly 25 per cent shortfall in the expected
cotton output after floods last year which hit crops in the heart of
Pakistan's cotton belt.
Output in the agriculture sector is expected to suffer badly. Last year's
growth rate of 6.4 per cent in agriculture is expected to drop below 4 per
cent, while the sector's overall contribution of 26 per cent to GDP is
certain to fall.
Cotton production is expected to be about 9m bales, down from the projected
12m bales. As a result, the textile sector has been affected too. One
evidence of the importance of cotton is that 58 per cent of last year's
exports came directly or indirectly from the crop.
'Reducing the fiscal deficit which means raising more resources and reducing
expenditure has emerged as the top priority item for us. If we cannot do
this we cannot even sustain the reform programme,' says Mr Sartaj Aziz, the
finance minister.
Mr Aziz plans to narrow part of the resource gap through taxation of
consumption rather than investments, as a way to encourage business
expansion while also raising more revenues. This may include higher revenues
through a general sales tax and central excise duties on industrial output.
However, the minister agrees that there are limitations on the extent to
which the division of expenditures can be changed around. Nearly 60 per cent
of Pakistan's budget is expected to remain committed to national defence and
debt servicing.
Mr Aziz hopes that the results of the government's economic reform programme
and its privatisation efforts will help compensate for areas where public
investment would otherwise be needed, such as creating employment. Despite
concerns over the economy, the finance minister expects a rapid turn around
and growth rates jumping up to 7.5 per cent, if cotton output recovers next
year.
One of the issues connected to deficit reduction targets is that of
Pakistan's commitments to international financial institutions. Pakistan has
recently been negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a Dollars
1bn (Pounds 660m) loan under an extended structural adjustment facility. In
the past, senior officials have said that bringing the deficit down to 5 per
cent of GDP, recommended by international donors, would require difficult
measures.
'Because we are in a growth situation where we have to make investments in
infrastructure and the social sectors, a drastic reduction is not compatible
with these two,' says Mr Aziz. I have been trying to convince the IMF that a
1 per cent reduction in the budget deficit is reasonable, otherwise we can't
maintain our growth rate.'
However, some western economists say, Islamabad will face questions at the
next aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting, due this summer, to explain why it
has repeatedly missed its deficit reduction targets for more than three
years. But Mr Aziz points first towards higher oil prices during the Gulf
war and the effects of international recession, as the key difficulties
during this time.
But, they also add, the public commitments by the government of Mr Nawaz
Sharif to continued economic reforms and privatisation are expected to earn
plus points. The recent restoration of his government through a Supreme
Court judgment, overturning a dissolution of the elected assembly in a
presidential order, is also being seen as a step forward in the democratic
process. However, Mr Sharif needs to hold on to power and create an image of
stability before economic reforms gain pace, western diplomats add.

THE Italian government has promised to change stock exchange rules which
force foreign stockbrokers to set up special offices in Italy, following
pressure from the European Commission.
The Commission has decided to give Rome until October 31 to submit proof
that the changes are under way, or face action in the European Court of
Justice.
If the rules have not been changed by January 15, 1994, court action will be
triggered automatically - three years after the first formal letter of
complaint from the Commission.
The UK government formally complained to Brussels about the new SIMs law -
named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new type of
securities house it created - in September 1991, arguing that it was an
unacceptable barrier to freedom of establishment and free provision of
services in the Community.
An Italian diplomat in Brussels said yesterday the government would probably
issue a formal decree, which could change the rules this autumn.
The British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association welcomed the
news and said changes in the Italian legislation had been widely expected
following the adoption of EC directives liberalising securities trading
earlier this year. 'People have got more relaxed recently and their worst
fears about prosecution (in Italy) or unenforceable bargains had gone away,'
said a spokeswoman.
The rules cover equity trading on the domestic market and the sale of
securities of any type to Italian investors other than SIMs or banks. Most
large EC-based investment banks have centralised European trading operations
in financial centres outside Italy, and were worried about the cost of
setting up elsewhere.
Bankers feared that the Commission's tough line against the Italian law
would be relaxed when Sir Leon Brittan was replaced as EC financial services
commissioner by an Italian, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, in January.
In fact, Mr Vanni d'Archirafi - a former Italian ambassador to Madrid and
Bonn - has managed to find an appropriately diplomatic solution to the
problem, aimed at producing a result before the formal implementation of EC
directives which will allow EC-based stockbrokers to do business anywhere in
the Community.
The Commission has argued throughout the negotiations that securities houses
have the right to set up in Italy using the legal form of their choice, and
even to provide broking services from other member states.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Andreotti and the murder case witness: The latest
allegations against the former Italian premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giulio Andreotti, Italy's former prime minister, was said yesterday to
have sought to put pressure on a witness in order to protect himself,
according to Rome magistrates investigating his alleged involvement in the
1979 murder of journalist Mino Pecorelli.
The magistrates said Mr Andreotti's alleged action had led them to request
that parliament speed up the waiving of his immunity so that he could face
charges of involvement in Mr Pecorelli's killing.
Mr Andreotti yesterday repeated his protestation of innocence and said he
had agreed to waive his immunity. He had already agreed to waive immunity to
answer allegations by Palermo magistrates of being associated with the
Mafia.
The magistrates' request was filed on Wednesday in a 92-page document that
contained serious differences in testimony on key issues between Mr
Andreotti and an array of witnesses testifying against him.
One of the witnesses contradicting the veteran Christian Democrat was Mr
Franco Evangelisti, a Christian Democrat senator and a long-time close
colleague.
The issues included the 1978 kidnap and murder by the Red Brigades of Mr
Aldo Moro, the former prime minister, links between politicians and the
Mafia, and the financing of Mr Andreotti's faction of the Christian Democrat
party.
As the contents of the Rome magistrates' investigations began to emerge,
there appeared to be clear links with those of their colleagues in Palermo.
They are both relying in part on the same source of information - Mr
Tommasso Buscetta, the former Mafia boss turned supergrass since 1984.
The two inquiries also focus on Mr Andreotti's relationship with the Salvo
cousins, two prominent members of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of
the Sicilian Mafia.
The Rome magistrates quote Mr Buscetta as claiming that the Pecorelli
killing was ordered by the Salvo cousins as a favour to Mr Andreotti. Both
the Salvo cousins are dead and Mr Andreotti has denied knowing them.
Mr Pecorelli was a journalist linked to the secret masonic lodge P2 and the
extreme right. He ran a small magazine, OP, which specialised in peddling
inside information on politics and the security services in a highly cryptic
style. His enemies regarded him as a blackmailer.
In reopening the case after it had been closed last year following ten
years' fruitless investigation, Rome magistrates have focused on the curious
circumstances of the last OP edition before Mr Pecorelli was killed. This
had a cover on Mr Andreotti headlined 'The President's cheques', which was
substituted at the last minute. The change appears not entirely unconnected
with a dinner organised the night before attended by top Christian Democrat
figures and members of the security forces belonging to P2 and during which
Mr Pecorelli was given L30m (Pounds 13,320) to help OP's finances.
The 'president' referred to Mr Andreotti's position as prime minister
(president of the council of ministers). The cheques referred to Mr
Andreotti's alleged involvement and control over financing - at least to the
tune of L1.4bn - which came from illicit funds of Italcasse, the state
banking institution, the now defunct chemical group SIR of the late Mr Nino
Rovelli and the Caltagirone building group.
The magistrates allege Mr Andreotti had direct use of these cheques. When
questioned on May 25 about these cheques, his testimony conflicted with that
subsequently given by Milan financier Mr Ezio Radaelli. The latter claimed
he received L170m from Mr Andreotti and that an emissary from the former
premier had attempted to persuade him he had obtained the money from another
source.
'It has been proved that after Senator Andreotti had been interrogated on
May 25, he exerted pressure via a colleague on a witness to tell a different
story,' the magistrates' report alleges. Mr Evangelisti also claimed he
received money from Mr Andreotti.
Equally damaging in the magistrates' request is a detailed examination of
the Moro kidnap and allegations of Mr Andreotti's knowledge about this.
Mr Evangelisti revealed that during the Moro kidnap he frequently met
General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, who headed the police inquiries, and
acted as an intermediary for Mr Andreotti in late night sessions by-passing
the normal channels of the then premier's private secretary.
Gen Dalla Chiesa, who was murdered by the Mafia in 1982, knew all the
secrets of the Moro kidnap, as apparently did Mr Pecorelli. Magistrates
believe Mr Andreotti has been economical with the truth on the Moro
kidnapping. In particular, they want to discover how much he knew about
suspicions that Mr Moro was killed with the complicity of the political
establishment, the Mafia and the security services.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Central banker appointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE composition of the Bank of Italy's four-man directorate was agreed
yesterday by the governing council, five weeks after Mr Antonio Fazio became
governor.
The new member of the central bank's executive body was named as Mr Vincenzo
Desario, chief supervisor since 1983 and the most likely choice in terms of
seniority. Mr Desario, 60, becomes one of the two deputy directors.
He joined the Bank of Italy in 1960 and has spent most of his career on the
inspection side. He replaces Mr Fazio who in turn replaced Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi when he became prime minister.
The confirmation of Mr Lamberto Dini as director-general suggests that the
authorities have been unable to find in the short term a suitably
prestigious post for him either in Italy or internationally. Mr Dini was a
contender to take over from Mr Ciampi as governor; but he was passed over in
favour of his younger colleague, Mr Fazio.
The fourth member of the directorate, and the third in rank is Mr Tommaso
Padoa Schioppa, who has held this post since 1984.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Slow recovery forecast for Swedish economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S economy has reached the bottom of the country's deepest recession
since the second world war, but recovery will be slow with unemployment
continuing to rise next year before falling slightly in 1995, according to a
three-year forecast by Handelsbanken.
The bank, one of the top two in Sweden, predicts that gross national product
will shrink for a third year this year, contracting by 1.4 per cent,
slightly less than the government estimates. But it says the GNP quarterly
average turned around in the first quarter and there will be a return to
overall growth next year of 1.2 per cent, rising to 2.3 per cent in 1995.
The improvement is largely attributed to exports, fuelled by the heavy
devaluation of the Swedish kroner last autumn, but expected to be sustained
over the next two years by underlying increases in competitiveness from a
decline in real wages - falling this year for the third year running - and
rising productivity.
Despite weakening markets in Europe, Handelsbanken expects Swedish companies
to expand market share and produce export growth of 23 per cent over the
three-year period.
However, the outlook for the domestic economy, where investment and public
and private consumption are set to remain weak, is much gloomier. Real
disposable income is seen as falling by 7 per cent this year, with no rise
anticipated in 1994 and 1995.
Unemployment is expected to grow to 7.8 per cent of the workforce this year
and peak at 8 per cent in 1994 before falling back to 7.2 per in 1995. These
figures, like official government figures, are reckoned to understate the
real jobless total by more than one third because of the large numbers in
training schemes.
Better news for Prime Minister Mr Carl Bildt's conservative-led coalition,
which faces a general election in late 1994, lies in the inflation forecast.
Handelsbanken predicts a drop in inflation to 2.6 per cent in 1994 after 4.8
per cent this year.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Brussels to take tougher line on fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to combat EC fraud are being hampered by staff shortages in Brussels
and lack of co-operation from member states, the European Commission claimed
yesterday.
Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the EC commissioner responsible for fraud prevention,
told MEPs that the Commission was seeking to improve co-ordination between
its own departments and member states.
He pledged to be tough on member states that did not meet deadlines for
notifying cases of potential fraud. At the moment, he said, only about 10
per cent of cases were notified on time, even though member states were
supposed to bear the brunt of investigating and punishing EC fraud and
recovering money lost.
The Commission's 1992 report on fraud, released in April, said reported
fraud totalled Ecu269.9m (Pounds 213.8m) last year, 44 per cent of it
related to farm subsidies.
But the Commission admitted that the scale of fraud was much higher than the
figures reported by member states and only about 10 per cent of the money
lost was ever recovered.
'In future the Commission will make sure that the member states do respect
their obligations,' Mr Schmidhuber told a public hearing of the European
Parliament's budgetary control committee. He added that Brussels was
examining whether to pay rewards for information on fraud, or offer
performance-related bonuses to investigators.
Mr Michel Jacquot, responsible for managing the EC farm budget, said many
member states failed to notify fraud to Brussels because they were ashamed
to admit it.
But Mr Schmidhuber said an increased flow of data about potential fraud
involving EC funds could never be a substitute for extra personnel. He
pointed out that about 121 Commission staff were working to fight fraud, 35
in the special fraud unit, known by its French acronym Uclaf.
Demands for a further 35 fraud-busters have had to be shelved because of a
general financial squeeze and the effective devaluation of the Ecu, in which
the EC budget is calculated, against the Belgian franc, in which most staff
salaries are paid.
The Commission has just helped uncover a large fraud in Italy, involving the
disappearance of at least Ecu77.7m worth of surplus EC grain, following a
similar fraud in Greece.
Mr Jacquot told MEPs the Commission was assisting grain fraud investigations
in two other EC countries, which he declined to name.
Brussels has already asked all member states to be on the look-out for
cereals fraud.

FT  11 JUN 93 / EC ready to adopt freedom of information policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC heads of government are set to agree US-style freedom of information
policy at their summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22, as a cornerstone of the
Community's attempt to restore its credibility with Europe's citizens.
The move will make most EC documents available to the public on demand,
except where their circulation might damage privacy, national security,
relations with non-EC states, commercial confidentiality or monetary
stability.
Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg, have agreed most of the
essentials of this freedom of information policy, which overturns the
current practice which makes all EC documents secret unless a Community
institution or member state decides to distribute them.
The 'openness' drive should be further reinforced next Wednesday, when the
European Commission publishes details of a new information policy, intended
to make Brussels more open to the public.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner in charge of opening up the
decision-making process, said there was now broad agreement among his
colleagues on the way forward.
A central plank of Mr Pinheiro's reform is to make it obligatory for the
Commission's information directorate - in a new and closer collaboration
with the rest of the Brussels bureaucracy - to research and respond to
public inquiries about EC policy, including policy-in-the-making.
Access to working documents, which reveal the thinking of the Commission, is
one of the most controversial parts of the plan, and is unlikely to be taken
up by the Council of Ministers, where the 12 negotiate and decide on
Commission draft laws.
The Council, with its veil of secrecy still intact despite letting in
television cameras to some formal sessions since February, is coming under
strong pressure to change its ways.
A meeting in Luxembourg on Monday night between the Commission, Council and
the European Parliament degenerated into a row over the difference between
confidentiality and secrecy. Parliamentary officials reject 'confidential'
as too loose and subjective, and Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
said Brussels would draft a definition of 'secrecy', in an attempt to forge
a consensus.
The ostensible spark for the row was the rules of operation for the EC
Ombudsman set up by the Maastricht treaty to investigate public complaints
about maladministration by the Community.
But it disclosed a fundamental split about how far member states are
prepared to go on openness and accountability at EC level. The Danes and the
Dutch are at one end of the spectrum, arguing for a full panoply of freedom
of information rules and procedures, while the UK, on Monday night strongly
backed by Germany, is vociferous in defending a minimalist interpretation of
'openness'.
One result is that broadly agreed procedures for 'subsidiarity' - limiting
action by the Community to those instances where national or regional action
would be inadequate - are being held up, in an attempt to moderate British
and German obduracy.

EC CONSUMERS are starting to see faint light at the end of the long
recessionary tunnel, according to a survey published yesterday by the
European Commission, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Although consumer confidence remained depressed in April, there was a
distinct sign of improvement for the coming 12 months, the survey said.
In spite of predictions this week that unemployment would rise from April's
10.4 per cent to 12 per cent next year, the survey said consumers had become
less worried about joblessness.

confirms launch of Dollars 275m A319 airliner programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING and Airbus are making progress on plans to develop jointly a super
jumbo airliner carrying up to 800 passengers, it was revealed at the opening
of the Paris Air Show yesterday.
Airbus also confirmed yesterday the launch of a Dollars 275m (Pounds 178m)
development programme to build the A319, a new 130-seat airliner which will
extend its family of twin-engined narrow-body aircraft.
The super jumbo proposals involve an aircraft with a range of more than
7,000 nautical miles with a possibility of building even bigger derivatives.
Mr John Hayhurst, Boeing's product director for the super jumbo programme,
said preliminary marketing studies suggested demand for 400 to 500 very
large airliners during the first decade of the next century.
Although no technical obstacles had so far emerged, Mr Hayhurst said the
parties were still a long way from deciding whether to launch a big
aircraft.
However both Boeing and Airbus are continuing their own competing large
aircraft development studies.
Airbus has recently stepped up discussions with potential Japanese partners
in the development of a new super Airbus - the A3XX - which if developed
would compete against Boeing's dominance of the jumbo aircraft market.
Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, is
considering developing a larger derivative of its 400 to 500 seat Boeing
747-400 airliner.
The Airbus consortium's new A319 is a smaller derivative of the 150-seat
A320 twin jet airliner. It will complement the Airbus narrow-body aircraft
range which also includes the 186 seater A321.
The A319 is designed to boost its competitive drive against the US Boeing
company which yesterday announced six orders worth Dollars 700m for its 767
airliners. The orders included two Boeing 767s for Gulf Air, another two for
EVA Airways and two for Japan Airlines.
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, said he believed there was a
market for 400 A319 airliners.
He said the consortium had decided to launch the new programme at a time of
recession in the civil aircraft market to position itself for the market's
eventual upturn in 1996.
First deliveries of the A319 to airline customers are expected in spring
1996Mr Pierson added. British Aerospace announced a Dollars 250m (Pounds
162m) order from a US corporate jet operator, Executive Jet Aviation of
Columbus, Ohio, for up to 20 of its BAe 125-1000 executive jets.
BAe has just sold its corporate jet activities to Raytheon of the US for
Pounds 250m but under the sale agreement will continue to build the
structure for the 125 family at Chester for at least the next three years.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Kohl backs Ukraine in fight for EC markets: Pro-Russian
stance denied during visit to Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday promised to push for greater
Ukrainian access to the markets of the European Community.
Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Kiev, he said: 'I will absolutely
say at the European Community meeting in Copenhagen that the markets of
Europe must be open to Ukrainian goods.'
Mr Kohl, whose country boasts one of the strongest relationships with
Ukraine of any western power, vowed to 'put forward Ukraine's interests' at
the July meeting in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries.
Mr Kohl's trip to Ukraine, his first visit there since it achieved
independence nearly two years ago, was designed to allay Ukrainian fears
that their country is being overlooked by western powers trying to forge
close links with Russia.
Mr Kohl told reporters: 'There can be no question of either/or, there can
only be relationships with both.'
The assurances come at a time of escalating disputes between Ukraine and
Russia over issues such as the contested Black Sea Fleet.
Mr Kohl also said he had received clear assurances from President Leonid
Kravchuk that the Ukrainian government remains committed to its earlier
non-nuclear policy. 'I noted with great pleasure the statement of the
Ukrainian government that it will continue to speak forcefully for the
ratification of the Start 1 treaty and the Lisbon protocol,' Mr Kohl said.
German diplomats added that Mr Kravchuk also promised to push for accession
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would entrench Ukraine's
status as a non-nuclear state. The assurances echo promises Mr Kravchuk to
the Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence earlier this week.
But it is parliament, not the president, which must ratify the arms pacts.
After the Ukrainian prime minister's popular call last week for Kiev, at
least temporarily, to keep some of its nuclear weapons, the Ukrainian
parliament seems unlikely to ratify speedily the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty which would enshrine Ukraine's status as a non-nuclear state.
About 10,000 coal miners of the depressed Donbass region went out on strike
on Wednesday. The highly Russified Donbass has been a hot-bed of political
protest since the first miners' strikes in 1989. In the current strikes, the
miners have added demands for regional autonomy and Mr Kravchuk's
resignation to their standard call for pay increases. Last night Mr Kravchuk
urged the miners on television to return to work and he endorsed their call
for new elections. He also promised further economic reforms.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Convoy ambush sparks fresh Bosnia fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ATTACK on a relief convoy in Bosnia led to a fresh upsurge of fighting
between Moslems and Croats yesterday. At the same time clashes between
Moslems and Bosnian Serbs also escalated on several fronts, Reuter reports.
Croatian gunmen pounced on a column of some 170 trucks taking food and other
supplies to the Moslem town of Tuzla. United Nations sources said at least
eight civilian drivers were dragged from their cabins and shot. Croats then
ransacked and looted some of the trucks.
The attack, near the disputed town of Novi Travnik, prompted a fresh
outburst of fighting in the area. Flashes from exploding artillery shells
were seen to the south-east of Novi Travnik as Moslem artillery evidently
resumed blasting Croatian targets.
Croat-Moslem battles over the past few days have killed hundreds and driven
thousands of Croats from their homes in the region.
Fighting between Moslems and Serbs, meanwhile, appeared to be intensifying
on several fronts.
The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo shook to the noise of mortar and artillery
shells after darkness fell. Hospital and mortuary officials reported that at
least six people had been killed and 37 wounded in the latest barrage.
Sarajevo radio said 3,000 shells had crashed into the besieged Moslem city
of Gorazde and its surroundings yesterday. In the town of Maglaj, civilians
huddled in basements and shelters as Serb gunners blasted Moslem targets.
In New York, the UN Security Council last night took a step towards
monitoring the Yugoslavia-Bosnia border, apparently including air
surveillance to check on weapons and other supplies to Bosnian Serbs. A
resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, asks the secretary-general to study
deployment and report back to the council, as well as seek intelligence on
border movements.
The measure is a far cry from earlier plans to deploy inspectors on the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav side of the Bosnian border, which diplomats last
month thought Belgrade would accept.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Yeltsin relaxed on constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday conceded that his constitutional
convention would probably fail to produce a draft constitution as quickly as
he had hoped, and he suggested that the assembly take a month-long break.
Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, Mr Yeltsin's chief legal adviser,
said during that time a special commission could sort out disagreements over
elements of a new constitution.
Mr Yeltsin had initially instructed the convention to finish work on his
draft constitution by next Wednesday.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who wants to delay the
adoption of a new constitution for as long as possible, engaged in some
familiar spoiling tactics yesterday. Claiming he was too ill to attend the
convention at which he was supposed to speak yesterday, he announced plans
to set up his own rival convention.
Meanwhile, the government continued to combine radical economic action with
old-style bureaucratic methods. At a cabinet meeting yesterday ministries
were given a week to come up with plans for a 20 per cent cut in
expenditure.
The cabinet also created an inner group of ministers to deal with urgent
economic reforms, to be headed by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime
minister, and including the government's three young radical deputy prime
ministers. One of the duties of the commission, which excludes Mr Oleg
Lobov, the conservative economics minister, is to implement an industrial
policy, the details of which have yet to be finalised.
Appearing weary, Mr Soskovets, who is formally responsible for industry,
stressed the importance of rebuilding economic ties with other former Soviet
republics.
Moscow police have arrested several officials in charge of the Russian
central bank's notoriously inefficient clearing system for alleged
involvement in the diversion of central bank funds on the basis of forged
transfer documents. An investigator in charge of the case said it was too
early to release details but that the arrests went as high as managerial
level. A spokesman for the central bank said that the arrests were confined
to the separately-managed payments system and did not affect management of
the central bank itself.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Serbian companies count cost of sanctions: Kerin Hope talks
to some of the financial victims of the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTEEN months ago, Simpo, the biggest furniture manufacturer in the former
Yugoslavia, was about to sign a contract with an Italian design group.
The Belgrade-based company could barely keep pace with local demand for its
latest line in rattan armchairs. With production for the first half of 1992
set to rise by 63 per cent, record exports were projected.
Now, Simpo's 5,000-strong workforce is on short hours and company executives
must pay for their coffee.
UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, imposed in June 1992 and
tightened two months ago, have forced radical changes on a company that used
to sell 70 per cent of its output abroad. In 1990, the year before
Yugoslavia started to break apart, Simpo's foreign sales totalled Dollars
120m.
Unable to export because of the embargo, Simpo took drastic cost-cutting
measures. It started local production of imported items, such as heavy-duty
staples formerly sent from Germany.
Faced now with the prospect of being excluded indefinitely from markets
abroad, the company's survival plan involves a comprehensive restructuring.
'We built a reputation for flexible management over the past 20 years. It is
now being challenged to the limit,' says Mr Slobodan Stojanovic,
international sales director.
Simpo is sharply scaling down its operations, offering to lease tools and
machinery to its workforce, based around 40 plants in Serbia. It is also
prepared to offer equity stakes of up to 51 per cent in more than 30
subsidiaries, from upholstery-makers to equipment repair and maintenance
companies.
'We may end up with a kind of cottage industry, with workers producing from
their homes,' Mr Stojanovic says. 'But we'll also still have a workforce,
when sanctions are lifted.'
Although relatively few Serbian companies have developed a strategy for
surviving the embargo, many former exporters make an effort to stay in touch
with former clients and their markets, attending conferences and trade fairs
around Europe.
The sanctions have hit hard. Serbia's share of total Yugoslav exports
amounted to about Dollars 4.7bn in 1990, according to the trade ministry.
Last year, exports were less than Dollars 1.5bn.
Imports of medical supplies are exempt from the embargo but that has not
halted the decline of Serbia's pharmaceutical industry. Overall production
plunged by 70 per cent in the past year, according to the pharmaceutical
manufacturers' association.
The government's foreign exchange reserves are too depleted to cover more
than basic drug imports for public health requirements. Pharmaceutical
companies complain of long delays in payment for supplying the state health
service.
Their biggest problem, however, is the reluctance of drug producers abroad
to supply raw materials to Serbia.
'It's the really big producers in Europe and the US that have dropped us
since sanctions started. Trading companies were more willing to continue,'
says Mr Radomir Stojicevic, president of ICN Galenika, Serbia's largest
pharmaceuticals producer.
ICN Galenika, which has a 50 per cent share of the Serbian pharmaceuticals
market, can now import only about one-third of its raw material
requirements, he says. Lay-offs have not yet started, but workers at several
plants have already been sent on on summer leave.
Controlled by Mr Milan Panic, the California-based millionaire who served
briefly as Yugoslavia's prime minister, the company is better placed than
its rivals to lobby for what Mr Stojicevic calls 'fair treatment under
difficult conditions'.
With reserves of Dollars 50m deposited in a Swiss bank, intended to fund its
investment programme, ICN Galenika argues that it has no problems in
providing guarantees to suppliers abroad.
Mr Stojicevic claims that ICN Galenika should not be penalised, because it
has complied with sanctions.
'Our exports used to be worth Dollars 70m yearly. We've stopped exporting
completely. When some of our products were spotted recently in Slovenia, we
sent documentary evidence to the UN sanctions committee that they were
smuggled,' he says.
For Credibel Bank, a private bank with 12 per cent of its equity base
provided by a group of Canadian investors, the problem was one of timing.
The bank, set up to promote private investment, received its operating
licence just before sanctions were imposed. When they were tightened in late
April, the foreign shareholders' Dollars 10m equity contribution was frozen.
As a result, Credibel confines its lending to short-term loans for small and
medium-sized private businesses in basic sectors such as food processing.
'Sanctions have had a catastrophic effect. We planned to do a lot of trade
financing, we'd developed contacts with banks in the European Community, and
we wanted to back some innovative projects. Now we can't plan, we just have
to wait,' says Mr Vladan Muzdalo, executive director.

<TEXT>
MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economy minister, yesterday called for changes
in the national labour laws to enable more flexible weekly working, easier
regulations for shift- and night-working, and more relaxed rules on Sunday
and holiday working.
In a special statement issued by his ministry - appropriately enough on a
day when most of the country was away from work for the religious festival
of Corpus Christi - Mr Rexrodt spelt out six principles he intends to
include in an amendment to the current employment legislation.
Changes in the labour laws - dating from 1938 - are a key element in Mr
Rexrodt's campaign to raise German competitiveness, and improve the
country's attractiveness for foreign investors.
He said new rules must make it possible to increase the number of hours
during which equipment and machinery is operated in German factories -
currently standing at a lower level than for any other leading
industrialised nation.
He proposed:
more flexible rules to allow deviation from maximum weekly working hours,
with a longer period allowed for workers to compensate for overstepping the
current limits;
abolition of the ban on women working night shifts, already outlawed by the
constitutional court;
flexible Sunday and holiday working to cater for leisure pursuits of the
majority, and to save jobs and create new ones;
more flexible hours for process working and research and development
activities;
more flexibility in wage contracts to cope with special circumstances.
'German enterprises must be in a position to adjust their working hours
flexibly to the demands of a modern industrial society,' Mr Rexrodt said.
Trade unions have served notice, however, that they are mistrustful of
efforts to ease working time regulations.

   TRAVNIK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAGILE ceasefire between Moslem and Croat forces went into effect
yesterday as the two former allies prepared to battle for another town in
central Bosnia, Reuter reports from Travnik.
Furious fighting until yesterday noon prompted United Nations peacekeepers
to appeal to them to spare civilians trapped by their war for territory.
Vitez, a town where British UN Protection Force troops are garrisoned 25km
southeast of Travnik, was 'apparently under siege' and extremely tense with
continued small arms fire and sporadic artillery fire, Ms Shannon Boyd, the
spokeswoman for the UN forces in Zagreb, said.
UN sources said sporadic mortar and sniper fire rang out around Vitez hours
after the truce, agreed by Croat and Moslem officers in Kiseljak on
Wednesday, went into effect.
Croats blocked all routes into the area with checkpoints and debris and the
main road between Vitez and the northern Moslem stronghold of Zenica was
also blocked.
It is in this area that UN forces are seeking guarantees on behalf of
civilians who have to run a gauntlet of Croat and Moslem roadblocks to reach
safety.
Moslems were reported to be attacking villages in the area of Novi Travnik,
and to the east around Busovaca.
The Croat Defence Force (HVO) accused Moslems of provoking a fresh outbreak
of fighting in Mostar and said a Franciscan monastery was set ablaze and 15
Croat soldiers were wounded.
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in Zagreb minutes before
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, cutting short an official visit to China,
landed to take charge of the Bosnia crisis.
Later the supreme commanders of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces signed a
sweeping agreement to end fierce fighting across central and southwest
Bosnia and set up power-sharing bodies.
Meanwhile Sarajevo radio reported continuing fighting between mainly Moslem
Bosnian forces and Serb troops around the Moslem refugee haven of Gorazde
yesterday.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Youth divided on patriotic pride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER than one in two young people in western Germany says he or she is
proud to be a German.
In the former communist east of the country, however, 68 per cent say they
are pleased with their national origin, in spite of all the psychological
and economic upheaval they are undergoing in the unification process.
On the other hand, 66 per cent of young westerners say they have foreign
friends. Only 19 per cent do so in the east.
On both sides of the national divide, an overwhelming majority rejects
violence against foreigners, including asylum seekers: the sort of violence
which has seen a spate of arson attacks on the homes of foreigners again in
recent weeks is justified by just 4 per cent of western youth, and 6 per
cent in the east.
Contrasts in the hopes and fears of young Germans in both halves of the
country have clearly emerged from the latest thorough survey of attitudes
carried out for the federal ministry for youth and women's affairs.
Conducted by the IPOS social research institute, the study also reveals big
differences in lifestyle on both sides of the former Iron Curtain.
Given the current economic recession, and rising unemployment, a
surprisingly high number in the 14- to 27-year-old age group say they are
satisfied with their lives: 95 per cent in the west, and 83 per cent in the
shell-shocked east.
The researchers warn that eastern youngsters who have only had the minimum
nine years of elementary school education represent a seriously deprived
social group. They are far more likely to be unemployed - 35 per cent,
against an eastern average of 16 per cent, and a western 3 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Europe must tackle high unemployment if it is to compete in the
modern world economy, Mr Gary Becker, Nobel economics prize winner said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid.
'Europe has an essentially skilled work-force but its jobless rate is
unnecessarily high and must be overcome for it to succeed as well as it
might,' Mr Becker told a business seminar.
Western Europe's jobless rate has been running at an average 9 per cent over
the past five years.
Mr Becker, who won last year's Nobel economics prize, said that in a free
trade era countries with the best-trained people will compete most
efficiently, provided companies are not stifled by employment taxes.
He said a serious by-product of unemployment is that those out of work are
not getting trained, and they lose skills. 'The unemployed have no
opportunity to learn on the job, and the skills they learned on the job are
gradually lost.'

FT  11 JUN 93 / Lamont faces barrage of invective: Major refers to 'a little
local difficulty' as senior Tories hit back in his defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont yesterday faced an unprecedented barrage of invective from
his erstwhile colleagues as Mr John Major's government struggled to regain
its balance in the wake of this week's onslaught by the former chancellor.
The attacks raised the possibility that the dangerous rift between the prime
minister and Mr Lamont might be prolonged. There were suggestions at
Westminster last night that intermediaries had told Mr Major's office that
the former chancellor was ready to respond in kind to any attempts to
discredit him.
In a further explosion of bitterness following Mr Lamont's dismissal two
weeks ago, Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, accused him
of 'thrashing around' in a 'nasty' and 'ludicrous' way to protect his own
reputation.
Others among his former cabinet colleagues said that Wednesday's assault on
the prime minister's leadership would be a 'nine-day wonder' as ministers
and senior backbench MPs launched a damage-limitation exercise to defend Mr
Major.
Mr Lamont was described as 'third-rate' by one minister who only two weeks
ago had sat with him around the cabinet table.
Conservative officials said a decision by the party last year to help the
then chancellor meet personal legal bills had created a backlash among Tory
supporters, costing it hundreds of thousands of pounds in potential
donations.
In the House of Commons, Mr Major made light of Mr Lamont's accusations that
his government acted as if it was 'in office but not in power'. Evoking the
phrase used by Mr Harold MacMillan when sacking Mr Peter Thorneycroft as
chancellor in 1958, Mr Major said the events represented a 'little local
difficulty'.
Brushing aside calls from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for an early
general election, Mr Major said he had no intention of commenting further on
Mr Lamont's statement.
But the prime minister will use a speech today to the Welsh Conservative
party to rebut Mr Lamont's claims that his government is preoccupied with
the short-term political effect of policy decisions. He intends to stress
his long-running commitment to keeping Britain at the centre of debate on
Europe's future and to beating inflation.
But the growing perception among its own supporters that the government is
consistently accident-prone was reinforced last night by the leak of
proposals by Mr Peter Lilley for large cuts in invalidity benefit.
Mr Major's more relaxed performance in the Commons was followed by a
carefully-crafted statement issued by the executive of the 1922 committee of
backbench Conservative MPs. The statement, agreed unanimously, offered the
prime minister '100 per cent support'.
Speaking after the weekly meeting of Conservative MPs, Sir Marcus Fox,
chairman of the committee, said that the statement had won a 'rapturous
reception' from the 150 or so backbenchers present.
Sir Marcus said all the contributions in the 15-minute meeting had supported
the prime minister, and had come from all shades of opinion within the
party. 'John Major is our prime minister, and will remain our prime minister
for a long time to come,' he said.
But the atmosphere of nervous calm did little to disguise concern among
ministers and backbench MPs that Mr Major's leadership remains in question.
Groups of rightwing MPs opposed to the Maastricht treaty were said to be
giving 'active consideration' to the possibility of a challenge to the prime
minister if the Conservatives lose the forthcoming Christchurch by-election.
Sir Marcus appeared to acknowledge the threat to Mr Major by calling for a
'change of style' by the government and suggesting that some of his advisers
might be replaced.
There were also the fears that Mr Lamont might react to any further attacks
by launching another assault on Mr Major, although he has told friends he
has no immediate plans to add to Mr Major's difficulties with a statement in
the near future or by enlarging on the themes in his speech on Wednesday.
He was relaxed about the impact of his comments, even though they had raised
questions about Mr Major's survival.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Row over premiums threatens insurance cover for terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the government-backed reinsurance company which covers
terrorism risks appeared to be in doubt yesterday after a row over plans to
introduce swingeing premium increases.
Insurers are poised to withdraw their support from Pool Re, the company set
up earlier this year after insurers withdrew terrorism cover from commercial
policies in the wake of the IRA's mainland bombing campaign last year.
Mr Ian Rushton, chairman of the Association of British Insurers, warned in a
sharply worded letter sent earlier this week to Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, that 'in future months it will be difficult to
continue to maintain the active co-operation of the insurance companies in
this venture'.
He added: 'The present approach shows that the DTI look upon Pool Re as
effectively their tool to undertake government wishes without any real need
for full consultation with the insurance industry.'
Under the scheme, companies insure their assets against terrorist attack
with Pool Re. In the event of a claim, Pool Re pays out until its own funds
are exhausted. If the claim amounts to more than the total amount available
to Pool Re, the government meets at least 90 per cent of the shortfall.
Take-up of the new terrorism policies has been more limited than expected.
Claims of more than Pounds 400m from the Bishopsgate bomb in April will
exhaust the new company's funds and have prompted the government to press
for changes in rates.
Businesses outside London will receive rate reductions, but some large
London buildings face rises of more than 300 per cent.
In the ABI letter, Mr Rushton said increases had been imposed without full
consultation. 'Very simply, the whole history of Pool Re to date shows a
serious lack of willingness to work in a co-operative manner with the
insurance companies'.
He said the ABI did not regard the initial target figure set for Pool Re's
annual premium income of Pounds 500m as 'realistic'. Low take-up of the new
insurance - especially outside London - suggests that the figure will not be
achieved. Mr Rushton said ABI members would be looking carefully at the
terrorist cover they continued to offer as part of commercial policies.

FT  11 JUN 93 / Leaked plan to cut invalidity benefit attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night threatened with another damaging political row
over its spending priorities after the leaking of plans to cut substantially
the cost of invalidity benefit.
A draft letter to the prime minister from Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, sets out proposals to tax invalidity benefit, make it less
generous, focus it more on the long-term sick and introduce a tough medical
test to restrict its availability.
A clampdown on the benefit was widely expected but the leak's timing is
highly embarrassing for ministers as they struggle to restore calm in Tory
ranks after Mr Norman Lamont's damaging resignation speech.
The proposals, drawn up in agreement with Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, would save Pounds 495m in the 1996-97 financial
year and Pounds 1.3bn a year by the end of the century.
But their impact on voters - particularly the elderly - will worry Tory MPs
already nervous about losing the forthcoming Christchurch by-election where
the Conservatives had a 23,000 majority in the general election. The letter
to the prime minister, apparently accidently leaked to the Press Association
news agency, says 'the changes are bound to be controversial' and reveals
that Mr Lilley failed last year to win cabinet approval for similar changes.
But it adds: 'I think the climate of opinion has now changed.' Mr Lilley
also says that Mr Portillo favoured still bigger cuts.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said Mr John Major had accused
Labour of scaremongering in the past but now 'has no credibility left and is
guilty of a gross deception on the British public'.
The number of invalidity benefit claimants has grown from 600,000 in 1978-79
to 1.5m today while the cost has soared from Pounds 840m to Pounds 6.2bn
over the same period - an increase that ministers do not believe corresponds
to a rise in invalidity cases.
Mr Lilley proposes restricting the changes to new benefit claimants. His
letter says: 'Taxation would introduce an element of means testing which
would be more acceptable than means testing the benefit itself.'

Mr Brian Clough, the former Nottingham Forest football club manager,
yesterday denied allegations that he liked a 'bung' - a personal payment -
when arranging soccer transfer deals.
The claims were made in the High Court by Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan

The Spurs chairman said Mr Venables told him of Mr Clough's payment

FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish issues pathfinder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURT CAVENDISH, the nursing home operator, has issued the pathfinder
prospectus for its flotation, which is likely to be 35 per cent by way of a
public offer and 65 per cent placing, writes Catherine Milton.
Mr Chai Patel, chairman, said the company had tentatively envisaged
splitting the shares 50:50 between the offer and the placing: 'After
discussions with the Stock Exchange we decided there are an awful lot of
issues in the market and we are looking for long term money.'
UBS, financial adviser and broker to the flotation, said it hopes to raise
about Pounds 15m more than the Pounds 23.6m debt the company is carrying, to
give a market capitalisation of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m.
The flotation will bring Court Cavendish to a growing sector of the stock
market including Takare, Quality Care Homes, and the most recent entrant,
Westminster Healthcare which floated in March.
Operating profits dipped to Pounds 2.8m in the year to April from Pounds 3m
a year earlier on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 13.3m).

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: DG Bank shows improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DG BANK is performing well after a period of consolidation, the chief
executive of the central bank for the German co-operative system said
yesterday, as the bank announced a 33 per cent increase in partial operating
profits for the first quarter of the year.
Mr Bernd Thiemann, appointed in the summer of 1991 to head what was then a
deeply troubled institution, said partial operating profits - excluding a
contribution from the bank's own-account trading activities  - rose to DM68m
(Dollars 42.5m) in the first four months of the year, up from DM51m in the
same period last year.
Mr Thiemann said the improvement reflected the bank's restored market
profile and cost-cutting measures.
He predicted further improvement over the rest of the year. Last year,
partial operating profit at the parent bank was DM311m after DM27m in 1991
but itonly broke even at the net level after provisions against doubtful
country and corporate risk.
The parent bank's surplus on interest income rose by 20 per cent to DM209m
in the first quarter of the year, while business volume fell 1.3 per cent to
DM129.4bn.
When Mr Thiemann joined the bank, it was suffering the after-effects of
over-expansion and financial imprudence. More than DM3bn has been injected
into the bank by shareholders over the past two years and Mr Thiemann
expects the bank to be restored to full financial health by 1995-96, when he
hopes that dividends will be paid again.

The sale of Uni Storebrand's and Hafnia's stakes in Skandia is almost the
end of the sorry Nordic saga. With Skandia's share register free of
unwelcome influences, and Hafnia in the hands of Sun Alliance, all that
remains is to repair Uni Storebrand's balance sheet. Since Uni bought its
shares at an average price of Skr220 and has sold at less than half that, it
is easy to see how the damage was done. The Norwegian institutions now being
asked to plug the gap must keep a tight rein on the imperial ambitions of
the company's management. All in all the episode is a reminder of just why
continental European insurers trade at a discount to net assets.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Banks count the cost of their biggest mistake: Free banking
was widely welcomed. John Gapper charts its introduction - and the rush to
abolish it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Pearse, chief executive of the bank that introduced free banking
for customers in credit, is characteristically blunt about the wisdom of the
move. 'Free banking was one of the two biggest mistakes ever made by high
street banks,' he told a building society conference last week.
Mr Pearse was chief executive of Barclays' US operation when Midland made
its move in 1984, shortly followed by the others.
The second mistake, in his view, was that banks did not co-operate to form a
common cash machine network. The second mistake is likely to remain in place
longer than the first.
The problems created by not charging customers unless they go into overdraft
 -and then imposing disproportionate charges - are increasingly pressing.
All banks are now considering charges to offset the annual Pounds 4.5bn cost
of services such as the 30 withdrawals each customer makes from cash
machines.
Abbey's disclosure yesterday that it is likely to introduce charging for
customers in credit will accelerate plans. Mr Tim Melville Ross,
Nationwide's chief executive, emphasised this week that the building society
would follow with charges on its FlexAccount if the big banks started
charging.
The pace of competition has accelerated because falls in base rates have
reduced earnings from banks' interest-free deposits.
The reduced return on 'free resources' lost National Westminster Bank 0.57
percentage points of interest on its Pounds 67.3bn UK interest-bearing
assets last year - or Pounds 380m.
Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer, says the effect on
profits was far lower because NatWest has 'hedged' its assets to reduce the
overall effects of interest rate movements. But banks now think they could
not sustain 'free' banking if base rates fell to 5 per cent.
But charges are a sensitive matter. About 6,000 customers of Save &amp; Prosper,
the small retail bank run by Robert Fleming, were directly affected when it
introduced a monthly charge for customers whose current account balances
fell below Pounds 1,000 at the end of the month. It has since lost 5,000 of
them.
Banks also anticipate a huge re-shuffling of accounts with an uncertain
final outcome following the re-introduction of charges because 13 per cent
of customers now hold more than one account. They may be prompted to choose
between them by the prospect of paying charges on a little-used one.
The ideal effect of re-introducing charges for banks would be that they lose
customers who are not worth keeping. But this does not necessarily mean
losing all the customers whose current accounts do not support the annual
cost of between Pounds 35 and Pounds 75 for the provision of basic clearing
services.
Many such customers hold other products such as savings accounts which make
them profitable overall. But no UK bank yet has the technology to calculate
this figure, and apply charges accordingly.
Mr Ian Lindsey, Save &amp; Prosper's banking director, says it is at least three
years away.
An alternative approach would be to charge customers per transaction to
ensure that those who cost most pay most. The difficulty is that this is
clearly unpopular.
Abbey National's own research found that 88 per cent of people thought fees
for 'core' transactions such as statements were unfair.
This is likely to push banks towards imposing a flat-rate fee per quarter or
month if a customer's balance falls below a certain level. This is dubbed
the 'Disneyworld' charge - a single pass to all attractions - by Professor
David Llewellyn, banking professor at Loughborough University.
Prof Llewellyn argues, however, that a better approach would be a 'two tier'
structure adopted by utilities which have high fixed costs attached to
distribution networks, such as British Telecom. This means a fixed quarterly
fee, plus additional charges for heavy use of some discretionary services.
Prof Llewellyn, whose recent study of the subject has been read closely by
Abbey, also argues that consumers should be given a choice of charging
structures to soften the blow.
But Abbey's decision makes it likely that the choice will come sooner than
many bank customers might wish.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Airbus set to launch new airliner -
Dollars 300m A319 programme aims to beat Boeing in narrow-body market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS is expected to launch today a Dollars 300m programme to develop a
smaller derivative of its 150-seater A320 twin jet airliner called the A319.
Although the European aircraft manufacturer has not so far not received any
substantial orders for the 130-seater A319, the consortium is anxious to to
expand its family of narrow body aircraft before its big US rival, Boeing,
launches later this year a new derivative of its 737 twin-engine airliner.
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, a 20 per cent partner
in Airbus, said yesterday the consortium wanted to expand its product base
in the midst of the recession in civil aircraft manufacturing to be in a
better position to take advantage of recovery in a few years time.
Boeing, he noted, had launched in the past some of its most successful new
aircraft programmes during a downturn in the highly cyclical commercial
aircraft industry.
So far only six A319s have been ordered, by the Californian aircraft leasing
company ILFC. But the Airbus partners, which include Aerospatiale of France
(37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent), Casa of Spain (4.2 per
cent) as well as BAe, believe a smaller version of the A320 would strengthen
its competitive position in the narrow body airliners market.
Deutsche Aerospace is particularly keen for the green light to be given for
the A319 programme because it expects the new aircraft will provide a strong
boost for the German civil aircraft industry. If the programme is launched,
the new aircraft is expected to be assembled by Deutsche Aerospace at
Hamburg where the other two Airbus narrow-body aircraft, the A320 and its
larger 180-seat derivative the A321 are made.
BAe, which employs about 10,000 people on Airbus work, would be responsible
for the wings for the A319. The new aircraft is expected to enter commercial
airline service in 1996.
Mr Evans told a Financial Times aerospace conference on the eve of the Paris
Air Show, that the Airbus partnership should be transformed into a public
limited company which would become 'a truly integrated European business'.
He urged the four Airbus partners to merge their Airbus operations, and
said: 'The pooling of assets in a single company structure would enable a
truly integrated production system to be managed.' But he acknowledged there
were still significant national objections to overcome although it was now
necessary for Airbus to move forward to compete in an increasingly
concentrated commercial aircraft market.
'It is almost inevitable that in the US there will be two military aircraft
and one large commercial aeroplane manufacturers against just the
possibility of one of each in Europe,' he said.
But Mr Louis Gallois, the chairman of Aerospatiale, told the conference that
the transformation of Airbus into a public company remained a complex
technical, industrial and political issue. He agreed, however, that it would
ultimately be in the best interest of the European aerospace industry to see
Airbus operate as an independent company even though the transformation was
likely to take a long time.
Mr Gallois said the recent decision of the new French government to
privatise Aerospatiale was unlikely to have any direct impact on any
eventual transformation of Airbus into an independent and integrated
European company. But he conceded it would give the French group greater
flexibility in negotiating alliances and partnerships with other aerospace
and defence groups.
Both Mr Evans and Mr Gallois saw an opportunity for Airbus to expand into
the military sector.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US to re-ignite row on aircraft subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE transatlantic trade dispute over commercial aircraft subsidies is set to
flare up again on the eve of the Paris Air Show, the world's biggest, with
growing signs that the US is seeking to lower the ceiling for direct
government subsidies for new airliner programmes from 33 per cent to 20 per
cent.
The Clinton administration appears increasingly intent in renegotiating the
bilateral agreement reached last year between the US and the European
Commission on aircraft subsidies which fixed the 33 per cent ceiling on
direct government subsidies for new aircraft programmes.
Senior officials of the European Airbus consortium yesterday claimed during
a Financial Times aerospace conference that the US was now trying to use a
clause in the 1992 agreement calling for multilateralisation of the
bilateral accord in which the subsidy ceiling would be reduced to 20 per
cent.
This is regarded by Airbus as a transparent attempt by the US to put into
question the original bilateral agreement, which took five years to
negotiate, while making no additional concessions on the level of indirect
funding that the US aerospace industry receives.
In the 1992 agreement, the amount of indirect subsidies were capped at 3 per
cent of the annual turnover of the country's aerospace industry.
Mr Wolfgang Piller, executive vice president of Deutsche Aerospace, one of
the four Airbus partners, told the conference that the Europeans were now
demanding 'complete transparency' from the US over its indirect support to
its aerospace companies.
'The Europeans have a real handicap in that they are unable, at the present
time, to match the indirect subsidies of the US, which, according to some
estimates, amount to about Dollars 1bn a year,' he said.
He described the Clinton Administration's stand on the aircraft subsidy
issue as 'hypocritical and unfair'. The US has consistently attacked
government subsidies for the Airbus programme as unfairly damaging US
commercial aerospace companies, especially at a time when the whole industry
was in recession. In recent years, Airbus has been aggressively increasing
its penetration of the US airliner market.
Other Airbus executives expressed concern over the latest US moves which
they feel are designed to undermine the European consortium's efforts to
develop a new very large aircraft, which would challenge Boeing's dominance
of the jumbo market.
The Airbus officials said the EC was expected to reject outright the latest
US proposals to multilateralise the bilateral aircraft subsidy agreement.
The original idea was to extend the agreement to cover other aerospace
manufacturing countries, notably Japan. But the Airbus executives said if
the US sought to use this process as a ploy to renegotiate the subsidy
ceilings in the bilateral agreement, the EC would simply oppose the
multilateralisation of the accord.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, also noted that the US had so
far refused to consider extending the aircraft subsidy agreement to cover
aero-engines. The UK group said this reflected the fact that its two big US
aero-engine rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, received
significant more support from their government than Rolls-Royce.

FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METSA-SERLA, the Finnish forestry group, bounced back into the black in the
first four months, showing a profit after financial items of FM102m (Dollars
18.8m), against a loss of FM2m the previous year. The recovery was due to
the depreciation of the Finnish markka, lower domestic costs and savings
from restructuring.
The company moved yesterday to take advantage of its improved position by
launching an international issue of 3m B shares which should raise about
Dollars 100m. Combined with a further FM460m expected from the take-up in
September of warrants from a 1987 bonds issue, Metsa-Serla is aiming to
improve its equity ratio from a low last year of 29.9 per cent to 37 or 38
per cent.
Company officials said Metsa was seeking acquisitions in Europe, playing on
the weakness of many operators to expand market share. It is also spending
FM200m this year, out of total capital expenditure of FM500m, on scrapping
an uncoated magazine paper machine at the Kirkniemi plant and replacing it
with plant to produce a new type of offset coated paper.
Metsa said falling costs and double-digit depreciation of the Finnish markka
were the chief factors behind its improvement. It saw little pick-up in its
main European markets, still hit by overcapacity and low prices.
In the first four months, group sales were up almost 4 per cent at FM2.74bn,
compared with FM2.64bn. Operating profit was FM351m, or almost 13 per cent
of sales, compared with FM229m, or 8.7 per cent of sales, last time.
For the full year, Metsa-Serla is predicting a return to profits after a
full-year loss in 1992 of FM290m. Sales are set to rise above FM8bn from
FM7.75bn last year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA chief executive Mr Bjorn Wolrath (above) yesterday said the group
would pursue its ambition of integrating insurance activities in its 'Nordic
home market' after three years of turmoil in the Scandinavian insurance
sector.
An ownership struggle culminated on Tuesday when Skandia's controlling
shareholders - Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia - sold stakes in
a SKr3.2bn (Dollars 444m) deal.
'We can now concentrate all our resources on the development of business
activities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, while implementing a restructuring
of our international operations,' Mr Wolrath said.
The group has signalled a retreat from non-life reinsurance and has a
strategy of gaining 20-25 per cent of the Scandinavian insurance market,
against 13-14 per cent. Lex, Page 14; Victor, Page 16

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is sending AC-130 attack aircraft to Somalia where they could be used
to retaliate for the killing of 23 UN peacekeepers, Clinton administration
officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
'They are going,' said one official who was asked if Washington was sending
the AC-130 'Spectre' gunships, heavily armed and computer-laden versions of
the US Air Force's lumbering four-engine C-130 military transports.
They said Washington was also considering UN requests to send tanks and
other weapons after an apparent ambush on Saturday, believed sprung by
forces of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, that killed 23 Pakistani
peacekeepers.
The AC-130s carry a 105 mm gun as well as 20 mm and 7.6 mm rapid-fire
machine guns. Their radar and computers are meant to help them destroy
targets with pinpoint accuracy.
Twenty Somalis were also killed in the ambush.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Gasholder damaged after bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI TERRORIST squad officers joined police forensic scientists and an Army
bomb disposal squad yesterday searching land near to a Gateshead gasholder
which was damaged early on Wednesday by an explosion and fire, Chris Tighe
writes.
More than 400 people were evacuated from nearby homes but nobody was injured
and there was no damage outside the site, the biggest gasholder compound in
Tyneside.
Detective chief superintendent Barry Stewart, head of Northumbria police
CID, said the incident was being treated as a crime.
It was too early to say how the explosion was caused. However, it resembled
an explosion in April at the Esso oil storage terminal in North Shields for
which the IRA claimed responsibility.
British Gas Northern chairman Mr James Marris said it was very unlikely that
the incident was caused by normal operations.
The company confirmed that the intruder alarm had sounded. An off-duty
British Gas employee living nearby raised the alarm and 80 firefighters
fought the blaze for an hour.
The gas supply to the gasholder was immediately cut off. The hole is now
under water. It will be weeks before it can be examined.
Earlier this year the IRA claimed responsibility for an explosion and fire
at a gasholder in Warrington, Cheshire.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Dinosaur discovery feeds film hype
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENCE today feeds the Hollywood hype machine the last morsel it needs to
promote Steven Spielberg's latest film. On the eve of Jurassic Park opening
in the US, a research team has announced that it has extracted the first
samples of genetic material from the dinosaur era.
The researchers include Dr George Pionar of the University of California,
Berkeley, who was a scientific adviser to the heavily promoted Jurassic
Park.
Its plot is based on the use of genetic engineering to re-create dinosaurs,
starting from the DNA in blood sucked by mosquitoes that were then preserved
in amber for more than 100m years.
The Pionar group has isolated insect DNA from a weevil trapped 120m years
ago in Lebanese amber. It is 80m years older than any DNA extracted
previously from amber - fossilised tree resin that has a unique capacity to
preserve organic material - and is the first from an animal alive when
dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Such a discovery would have seemed like science fiction be-fore researchers
started studying ancient genes in the mid-1980s. It depends on
gene-amplifying technology called polymerase chain reaction, which enables
scientists to make billions of copies of any piece of DNA.
The Californian scientists obtained enough DNA to carry out a genetic
comparison with present-day weevils. But it represents less than
one-millionth of the ancient creature's total genetic complement - all of
which would be needed to resurrect the extinct species.
Nature, the UK journal which publishes the Californian DNA research in
today's issue, insists that its release a day before the film is 'pure
coincidence'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Executives eighth in earnings league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP EXECUTIVES of small and medium-sized UK companies are only eighth in the
European after-tax pay league, the 1993 survey of Top Management
Compensation by Wyatt Data Services shows.
A British chief executive, married with two children, took home an average
Pounds 55,000 last year. Based on the head of a company with a turnover of
Pounds 68m, the UK salary is Pounds 34,520 less than for a comparable
position in Switzerland, which tops the league table.
Adjusted for the cost of living, however, the UK jumps into fourth place,
behind only Germany, Italy and France, with Switzerland sixth.
Without a cost-of-living adjustment the other countries that come ahead of
the UK - apart from Switzerland - are Germany, France, Austria, Italy,
Luxembourg and Spain, where the salary is Pounds 2,710 more. Below the UK
are Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, the Irish Republic, Sweden, Denmark,
Finland, Portugal and Greece.
The US comes well ahead of even Switzerland, however, with a typical top
manager of a small or medium-sized company earning Pounds 94,750 after tax -
Pounds 38,580 more than in the UK.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Bank is cheered by victory of inches: Mixed response to
Lamont's 'independence' call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at the Bank of England were last night congratulating themselves
in the belief that their long campaign for independence in monetary policy
was inching towards success.
Nobody would have been more pleased at Mr Norman Lamont's call for an
independent central bank than Mr Eddie George, who takes over as Bank
governor next month. The anti-inflation hawk has made plain that achieving
stable growth without undue price rises would be made easier if the Bank
rather than politicians controlled interest rates.
Mr George was heartened not only by Mr Lamont's statement that for two and a
half years he had tried to persuade Mr John Major that the Bank should be
independent, but also by the prime minister's refusal to rule this out so
long as Threadneedle Street could be accountable to parliament.
The Bank said yesterday: 'We believe that the key objective of monetary
policy is to safeguard the value of money, but that for so long as policies
are in place which secure that, the precise constitutional status of the
central bank is less important.
'That is the position now, in that the government is committed to an
inflation target and the Bank of England has a role in monitoring its
achievement.
'Nevertheless as the governor has said on many occasions, there are clear
advantages in making the central bank directly responsible for achieving
price stability, if only because this may enhance the credibility of
policy.'
Mr Lamont's campaign to change the prime minister's mind was known only to a
few people.
Mr Warwick Lightfoot, who was one of Mr Lamont's economic advisers between
his taking over as chancellor in November 1990 and April 1992, said last
night: 'The chancellor never discussed this idea within my earshot.'
But it emerged last night that top Treasury officials worked on the plan
early this year, providing papers which Mr Lamont gave to Mr Major before
the Budget.
The Treasury refused to divulge any details of discussions on the issue
between Mr Lamont and Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary. Sir
Terry, then the Treasury's chief economic adviser, was among several top
officials instructed in 1988 by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to work
on a secret scheme to give the Bank independence.
That plan was vetoed by Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister. It only
came to light in Lord Lawson's resignation speech in 1989 which, in putting
the case for taking control of borrowing costs away from ministers, was
uncannily similar to Mr Lamont's address yesterday.
One comment last night from someone who knows Mr Lamont is that the deposed
chancellor - possibly subconsciously - was paying homage in his speech to
the ideas of Lord Lawson, to whom he had been politically close.
Bank officials yesterday said they had no knowledge that Mr Lamont had been
trying to change government policy on this issue. During his tenure as
chancellor Mr Lamont continually backed the government line that ministers
should set interest rates.
In an interview with the FT in December 1991 Mr Lamont said: 'Ministers are
accountable to parliament for economic policy, including monetary policy,
and I have no plans to change the status of the Bank of England in stage two
(of European economic and monetary union which is supposed to last until
close to the end of the 1990s).'
In the interview he answered 'none whatsoever' to a question as to whether
there were policy differences between him and the prime minister.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Analysts see no merit in change: Mixed response to Lamont's
'independence' call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY ANALYSTS were less than impressed by Mr Norman Lamont's call for an
independent central bank.
Although many are in favour of wresting control of monetary policy from
politicians, the response to yesterday's speech was that once again the UK
was searching for a panacea to its enduring problem of inflation.
Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'Nigel Lawson
made a similar plea when he resigned, but I am afraid it misses the point.
What you really need is not so much a constitutional change which allows for
an independent central bank, but an aversion to inflation on behalf of the
population.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'In the late 1980s
everyone thought that ERM entry would be the answer to inflation.
'I think it is rather depressing that we are again looking for a holy grail.
In the end it boils down to whether we have the right policies or not, and
an independent central bank isn't going to change that.'
This view was echoed by Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburgs. 'I
am not sure that an institutional change will solve the UK's underlying
macroeconomic problems,' he said. 'An independent central bank would help,
but it isn't necessarily the panacea for inflation that people think it is.'
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said it was
remarkable how retired chancellors appeared to see the attraction of handing
over monetary control to an independent body as soon as they left office.
'It probably would be an advantage,' he said. 'But I think the advantages
are grossly overdone.'
Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, said that even an
independent central bank would have to earn its own credibility. 'Just
having one does not automatically prove your credibility as a low inflation
country,' she said.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Effortless cheer marks Clarke's
debut as chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST the Conservatives had someone to cheer.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's first appearance as chancellor at the Commons despatch
box offered nothing to anyone hoping for an insight into his thinking on the
intricacies of monetary or fiscal policy.
But then the sullen, serried ranks of Tory MPs who had earlier sat through
his predecessor's savage attack on the prime minister were not in the mood
for amateur economics.
Bemused and bewildered at their party's infallible ability to shoot itself
in the head, they wanted their spirits lifted: a politician to wipe the
beaming grins of their counterparts on the opposition benches.
Mr Clarke delivered. The man who had admitted earlier in the day that, yes,
he had been known to cross the street to start a fight, set about Mr Gordon
Brown.
The shadow chancellor was congratulated on his jokes. Mr Clarke admitted
that even he sometimes found it difficult not to laugh at the jibes directed
at his cabinet colleagues.
But where was Labour's policy? Mr Brown's speech had had 'about as much
policy content as the average telephone directory'. He warmed to the theme:
'The best parts of it came when you were quoting me.'
The Tory MPs who had sat glumly through Mr John Major's defence of his
record cheered. Mr Clarke raised the level of invective. An attempted
interruption by a Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's one-time campaigns
co-ordinator and image-maker brought a scornful dismissal of his party's
reliance on public relations glitz.
'If you think we have achieved what we have achieved so far and what we are
going to achieve by plastic red roses and smart suits you have another think
coming'.
The Tories cheered again, louder. Mr Clarke stuck with the theme. There was
nothing original in attacking Labour for refusing to offer its alternatives.
Mr Lamont in his time had used the technique effectively.
But Mr Clarke - just 14 days in the most difficult job in the government -
exhibited effortlessly the political skills which his predecessor so sadly
lacked: confidence, humour, and above all, a willingness to discuss economic
policy in the terms understood by the voters. Mr Clarke's Treasury would
concern itself with the real world - with jobs, with business. The Tories
cheered again.
There was just time for a few thoughts on economic policy, Echoing earlier
media interviews, Mr Clarke spoke of his determination to sustain the
recovery, to hold down inflation, to tackle the 'iceberg' of the public
sector borrowing requirement. He reminded his backbench fans he would expect
their support when he took the hard decisions needed to restrain public
spending.
Mr Clarke sat down to a roar of approval. Mr Major patted him on the back.
As the two men walked towards the voting lobbies, their colleagues on the
backbenches kept their thoughts to themselves.
The government subsequently secured a majority of 24 (302-278) to defeat a
Labour motion condemning the prime minister's 'betrayal of election promises
and commitments on economic and social policy'.
A government amendment deploring 'scaremongering stories' about public
spending peddled by Labour MPs was carried by a majority of 30.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERU is to grant South Korea about 1m square metres of territory on the
coast north of Lima for the establishment of a free trade zone, writes Sally
Bowen in Lima. It will be the first such venture in newly liberalised Peru.
According to Mr Oscar de la Puente, the prime minister, the area under
consideration is about 40km north of Lima, with easy access to the port of
Callao.
South Korean entrepreneurs will be expected to install all the necessary
infrastructure - access roads, water and sewage as well as energy
generation.
'Peru won't invest a cent in this,' the Peruvian premier said. He denied
there would be a threat to Peruvian sovereignty. 'This is co-participation
in development,' he said.
The new commercial relationship between South Korea and Peru was announced
during a visit by President Alberto Fujimori and senior government officials
to Seoul, part of a 10-day, investment-promotion tour to a variety of Asian
countries.
South Korea has offered Peru a gift of Dollars 18m (Pounds 11.6m) to
rehabilitate the international airport in the Andean town of Cuzco.
Reuter adds: Speaking in Los Angeles, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
said this week that his country now offered tremendous profit opportunities
to foreign investors willing to do business there.
'The inflation rate has declined from 7,695 per cent in 1990, to 130 per
cent in 1991, and to 60 per cent in 1992,' Mr Fujimori said.

acquisitions

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Boston, the largest bank in Massachusetts, has been given approval
by the US Federal Reserve to buy two New England banks, Multibank Financial
and Society for Savings Bancorp.
The Bank of Boston will pay with its own shares an equivalent of around
Dollars 232m for Multibank, and Dollars 215m for Society for Savings. The
two banks would add Dollars 4.8bn to Bank of Boston's existing assets of
Dollars 32bn.
The purchase is still conditional on approval by the Massachusetts Board of
Bank Incorporation, but this is expected to be a formality. Bank of Boston
had to promise to raise around Dollars 170m in new capital to win approval
from the Federal Reserve for the purchase of Multibank.
Two Federal Board governors opposed the authorisation, on the grounds that
the promise to raise new capital was not part of the Bank of Boston's
original application. The two members believed the addition of new
information after the original application 'impairs the integrity of the
Board's decision-making process'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 310 securities firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange
earned record after-tax profits of Dollars 1.51bn in the first quarter of
this year.
The total is up sharply from the previous record of Dollars 1.36bn, set in
the first quarter of last year, and provide more evidence that the boom in
Wall Street earnings shows no signs of slowing down.
The firms' total revenues reached a record Dollars 17.75bn, up from Dollars
16.48bn in the same quarter of 1992. Revenues were strong due to several
factors that have sustained the securities industry for the past two years.
They include heavy demand for stocks from individual and institutional
investors; an extremely busy debt and equity underwriting calendar; strong
growth in client assets under management; and a highly favourable domestic
interest rate climate.
The NYSE said members' assets jumped to Dollars 841.9bn, up from Dollars
631.57bn a year earlier.
NYSE firms' expenses were a record Dollars 15.45bn in the quarter, a
reflection of the fact that employee compensation is tied to earnings
performance.

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILAN stock exchange has appointed its first full-time managing
executive to oversee operations as a further step in its gradual
modernisation and reorganisation.
Mr Benito Boschetto, formerly secretary-general of Milan's chamber of
commerce, is to be the stock exchange's first director-general, answering to
the recently-created council formally responsible for running the market.
The appointment marks a further gradual reinforcement of the market as an
independent entity, rather than just a trading floor loosely run by
stockbrokers.
Italian equity trading has been thoroughly overhauled over the past three
years. The changes have seen the virtual disappearance of small,
undercapitalised stockbrokers and the creation of stronger and transparent
broking companies.
The reforms have also affected the organisational structure of the bourse,
which used to be run by a committee of leading private stockbrokers.
Although independent brokers are still represented on the new council,
created last December, the body comprises a much broader spectrum of market
participants, including the big banks.

FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Latin Americans perform as Turkey holds
its own - John Pitt reviews Istanbul's lead this year over winners and
losers among emerging markets in May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America provided the best performers among the world's emerging
markets in May, although significant gains were also to be seen in Portugal,
Indonesia and India.
Turkey, still the best performing market this year in dollar terms,
according to data supplied by the IFC, a part of the World Bank, fell back
slightly as some investors decided to lock in profits.
The political vacuum left by the election of Mr Suleyman Demirel last month
as president, thereby vacating the prime minister's office, seems to have
had little effect on the Turkish equity market.
Ms Nur Pekin of Schroders in London comments that the rally has partly been
driven by a change in the law encouraging institutional investors to switch
funds into equities: under the new legislation, funds which have at least 25
per cent of their portfolios in equities only have to pay a 10 per cent
withholding tax.
Furthermore, says Ms Pekin, 'robust economic growth continues to boost
company earnings: first-quarter interims have in the most part been
excellent, with real earnings up by more than 100 per cent in many cases'.
Taken together with falling interest rates - three-month rates are down to
67 per cent from last year's 76 per cent - Schroders is forecasting that the
index will reach 10,000 by the year-end, against its present level of around
8,580.
Brazil was lifted last month by the appointment of Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso as economics minister, so much so that the Bovespa index rose by
more than 7 per cent on news of the cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Eduardo Faria of Latin American Securities observes: 'The new economics
team brings a degree of technical competence which has been absent from the
ministry since President Franco took office.' But he continues: 'With
inflation running dangerously close to 30 per cent per month . . . a skilful
compromise between much-needed fiscal discipline and Franco's commitment to
economic recovery will need to be reached.'
Elsewhere in the region both Colombia and Venezuela saw positive movements
last month, the former assisted by good company results, particularly in the
financial sector, and increased foreign demand, and the latter by the
suspension from office of President Carlos Andres Perez on corruption
allegations.
In Asia, India drew ahead, although not enough to move it off the bottom as
the worst performer since the start of the year. Mr Nigel Spence of Lehman
Brothers says that weak corporate results, high interest rates and the slow
pace of labour reform have all contributed to dull the market. But, he adds,
the start of the monsoon season today should provide the traditional
short-term bounce.
Indonesia, always a fairly illiquid market, was driven higher in May by
strong US and European interest attracted by indications of improving
economic activity.
Portuguese equities enjoyed the benefits of a devaluation and a sharp fall
in April inflation data which drew investors back to the market. Mr John
Ferreira of Carnegie comments that 'the low domestic and foreign equity
weightings before the devaluation (on May 13) suggest that there is a strong
momentum argument for the market'.

FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major dismisses monetary union
deadline - Sacked chancellor rounds on PM as politics overshadows economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING WAS unlikely to return to the European exchange rate mechanism for
some years - perhaps not before the election - Mr John Major said yesterday
as he made clear his belief that the idea of monetary union in 1997 was
'wholly unrealistic'.
Prompted by the statement from Mr Norman Lamont, the prime minister
expressed some sympathy for the possibility of an independent central bank.
During Mr Major's speech itself, which was marked throughout by rowdy
interventions from opposition MPs, politics overshadowed econ-omics in the
Commons chamber.
One Tory backbencher intervened, however, to praise the prime minister for
emphasising that for the UK to rejoin the ERM there would have to be greater
convergence of the monetary policies of all the main European Community
economies, and the mechanism would have to operate to the benefit of all its
members.
'I now doubt whether these circumstances will apply for some years ahead -
possibly not in this parliament,' Mr Major said.
But he insisted that his view that the EC countries would not be ready for a
single currency for many years, if ever, was not 'anti-European'. Instead it
came from his belief that the conditions would not then be in place and that
the damage from a premature move towards monetary union would be profound.
While agreeing that there was a case for giving independence to the Bank of
England, Mr Major said that the underlying policy was more important than
the institutional arrangements. He did not believe, he said, that an
independent central bank would have brought inflation down more quickly than
the government had achieved.
His main concern was that politicians should still be able to call to
account those who made decisions about monetary policy.
'Were a way to be found to get the benefits of an independent central bank
without a loss of parliamentary accountability, my views would be closer to
yours,' Mr Major told his former chancellor.
His tribute to Mr Lamont, that 'history will look favourably on your
economic and financial skills', provoked Labour jeers of 'Why did you sack
him then?'.
That question was effectively answered as Mr Major continued: 'But a strong
government needs political skills as well when leading a democratic society
and, in particular, handling a lively House of Commons with a small
majority.'
The political impact of the government's likely public spending decisions on
Tory backbenchers already worried about the possibilities being floated, was
clearly in Mr Major's mind as he set out the basis of the spending review.
The criteria would be, he said, whether any changes were fair and whether
vulnerable people were protected. 'I did not come into politics to dismantle
the welfare state.'
But he sought also to dismiss the accusation by Mr Lamont that ministers
were more concerned to take popular than right decisions. He said that in
tackling the state of the public finances the government was taking
long-term views, not going for short-term options.
This was in stark contrast to the attitude of the other parties, he said,
attacking Labour for 'contracting out' the difficult decisions to be taken
on welfare benefits to its commission on social justice.
The prime minister also mounted a vehement attack on Mr John Smith, as he
contrasted the Labour leader's reputation for honour with the
'scare-mongering' tactics of his party. 'In the Labour party the scares come
from the top - behind that moral righteousness is someone who has no
scruples whatsoever,' Mr Major said.
When he sat down at the end of his speech it was MPs on the opposition
benches who shouted for more.

FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares advance as rate hopes revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON joined with other European bourses yesterday in turning higher as
currency developments lent some support to hopes for a cut in German
interest rates. Trading volume in equities remained moderate but the FT-SE
100 Index advanced a further 22.5 points into its current trading range and
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index jumped 15 points to another all-time peak.
At least two sizeable trading programmes were identified early in the day
and dealers reported that US buyers were active. The UK market received a
final boost from a firm opening to the new Wall Street session, where the
Dow Average was 16 points ahead in UK trading hours.
In particular, confidence benefited from a rally in the Zeneca share price
as sizeable bear positions were closed; fund managers seemed to be taking
the view that the Zeneca price of around 610p was the acceptable low point.
The strength of the US dollar, accompanied by predictions by Mr George
Soros, the international investor, that the German currency will fall,
helped the blue chip inter-nationals.
On the domestic front, the stock market welcomed assurances from Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the new UK chancellor of the exchequer, that he would remain 'a hawk
on public spending'; encouragement for such policies also came from Mr
Norman Lamont in his formal resignation speech to the UK parliament. This
offset recent suggestions that the UK government might favour increasing
domestic taxes, perceived as a negative fac-tor for the stock market.
Stock index futures helped the equity market brush off a dull opening and
the Footsie was ahead by 15 points as it waited for Wall Street to open. The
Dow's early strength gave further encouragement and the final reading showed
the FT-SE Index at 2,866.9 for a net gain of 22.5 points. Another strong
performance in second line stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up by 15.3 to
3,213.4.
Seaq volume increased to 691.2m shares, with non-Footsie business making up
around 60 per cent of the total. 'There was a good deal of switching by fund
managers yesterday,' said Mr Nigel Little at Panmure Gordon, the UK broking
house. Investors appeared to be shying away from some of the higher price
multiples now showing in a UK stock market trading on 21 times earnings on
the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index.
The London market was led forward in early trading from an overflow of
demand from Amsterdam for Shell and BP and edged higher when New York
opened. But although US selling of the pharmaceutical stocks died away, the
newfound support for Zeneca was not translated into active buying across the
drugs sector.
The recent upswing in the property sector continued to benefit the UK
clearing bank stocks, where loan books are still heavily charged with bad
debts to the commercial property sector. Consumer issues also performed
well, on relief that increases in UK personal taxation appear less likely.
The following companies will be added to the FT-SE 100 Index on Monday June
21 1993: Wolseley, SG Warburg, British Aerospace and RMC Group. The
following will be excluded: Fisons, Kwik Save, Lasmo and Southern Electric.

FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe gains extended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of re-entry into the FT-SE 100 list of quoted companies,
confirmed after the market close, brought further demand for shares of
British Aerospace.
The stock jumped a further 14 to 423p in brisk trade of 8.5m. Sentiment was
further boosted by another spate of brokers' recommendations, including one
from Strauss Turnbull which said: 'Our long-term target is over Pounds 10.
That is what British Aerospace is worth.'
The recent slide in the drug shares was partly arrested, with both classes
of Zeneca stock staging a strong recovery as marketmakers were caught short
of stock. Investors focused on the good yield offered by the shares and some
of the action funds switched out of recently outperforming ICI into Zeneca.
The 'old' ran up 8 to 620p on hefty turnover of 8.2m, while the 'new'
spiralled upwards to end 6 ahead at 20 1/2 p.
ICI, on the other hand, eased 2 to 695p on moderate turnover of 3.5m.
SmithKline Beecham's move to sell its bath and bodycare brands to Sara Lee
Corporation, of the US, for Dollars 320m helped SmithKline shares stabilise
and rally to close well above the day's low. The stock finished a net 6 off
at 429p, after 425p, on turnover of 4.1m.
Mr James Culverwell, pharmaceuticals analyst at Hoare Govett, described the
move as 'a good deal at a premium to sales and in line with the company's
strategy of focusing on its core healthcare business'.
Wellcome, bruised by the criticism of its anti-Aids drug Retrovir at the
Berlin Aids conference, dropped to 712p before staging a rally to finish
only 2 off at 726p.
Lasmo's relegation to the FT-SE Mid 250 Index upset the share price and
inspired a strong rise in Enterprise Oil, as the big institutions switched
out of the former and into the latter as it became the only means of playing
the exploration and production sector in the FT-SE 100 Index.
Lasmo shares receded 3 1/2 to 159 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 7.6m - and were
said to be looking under strong downside pressure after the close - while
Enterprise jumped 11 to 478p on 1.5m.
Burmah Castrol lost 5 more to 690p as the market continued to react to
bearish news on industrial lubricants in Germany, where sales are thought to
be down by some 8 to 10 per cent.
Boots managed to make up some of the ground lost on the previous day with a
gain of 2 to 437p in volume of 3m. Marks and Spencer, which announced that
it was raising Pounds 150m through an issue of sterling notes, finished just
1 higher at 343p after firming to 345p in earlier trading. Volume came to
4.1m shares. Dixons moved up 6 to 214p.
A programme trade was reported to be behind King- fisher's early gain of 10.
The group finished a net 6 up at 604p on 2.3m shares traded. Great Universal
Stores 'A' pushed up to 1650p, a rise of 20 on the day. WH Smith 'A'
advanced 7 to end at 449p. Against the upward trend of the stores sector,
Dunhill Holdings fell back 3 to finish at 341p, a slight rallying after
greater losses in mid-trading.
Great Portland Estates, fresh from its cash call success, slipped back 1 to
end at 196p. Land Securities pushed ahead 8 to 595p in thin trading and MEPC
added 4 to reach 445p, again in low volume. Warner Estates and Bradford
Properties took bruisings in early trading, with Warner falling 9 to end the
day at 224p and Bradford losing 7 to 200p.
Persistent buying by one institution and an absence of sellers was thought
to be behind the climb of 10 by Frogmore Estates to 434p. One analyst
thought it would not be out of step for Frogmore to be looking towards
acquisitions. Rumours circulated in the market last week that the company
would soon join the swell of property companies turning to shareholders for
extra funds.
In a generally upbeat sector, Mansfield Brewery moved ahead 15 to 800p after
announcing an increase in pre-tax profits. Mr David Thompson of Kleinwort
Benson is bullish about the drinks industry. 'The sector is very good value.
A lot of recent fears, especially in the US over drink taxes, have been
overdone. Profits forecasts are likely to be upgraded rather than
downgraded.'
Another analyst forecasted increased demand for second-line brewery stocks,
perhaps at the expense of the larger and more debt-exposed players.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries moved up 8 to 460p in modest volume;
Allied-Lyons made a gain of 8 to 542p in a volume of 1.6m shares.
Further strength in the property sector continued to boost P &amp; O and the
shares raced forward another 18 to 648p on volume of 2.4m. The strong market
trend helped British Airways bounce 6 to 296p in trade of 6.5m.
A recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted Tate &amp; Lyle, the shares
closing 9 up at 371p. Kwik Save, which lost its place in the FT-SE 100
Index, declined 8 to 742p ahead of that confirmation.
Shares in MB-Caradon fell 16 to 277p as Tuesday's profits downgrading from
Goldman Sachs, following a profits warning by a US competitor, continued to
exact a toll.
The prospect of new orders at the Paris Air Show and the sentiment in BAe
boosted Rolls-Royce and the stock added 3 1/2 at 150p. Strong demand for
British Steel made it the day's most actively traded stock. The shares
firmed 2 1/2 to 104 3/4 p on turnover of 14m. APV weakened 6 to 98p after
Smith New Court downgraded profits expectations. Johnson Matthey moved
forward 8 to 458p after reporting results at the top end of market
forecasts.

FT  10 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Plasterboard blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preliminary results from Meyer International, the builders merchant, were in
line with market expectations and had little real effect on the market, but
comments from the company about downward trends in the plasterboard industry
produced a sharp slide in BPB shares.
The latter, the UK's leading plasterboard manufacturer and one of Europe's
top producers, plunged to 219p before settling a net 14 off at 221p in
exceptionally heavy turnover of 4.8m after Meyer directors told industry
analysts that BPB's most recent plasterboard price rise was not sticking.
The price rise, 11 per cent and the third introduced by BPB in the last 18
months, was said by analysts to have been too much and too early. 'It is
disappointing, but not tragic,' said one specialist.
Other analysts, however, muttered darkly about problems in France, where the
building sector is suffering badly, and also mentioned that BPB's monopoly
position in plaster supply is threatened by new capacity at Lafarge and
Knauf. BPB announces results on July 1, with analysts looking for profits of
Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m, compared with last year's Pounds 38m.
Meyer also took a bearish view of prospects in Germany, triggering a slide
of 9 to 478p in Redland. Meyer lost 7 to 375p.
