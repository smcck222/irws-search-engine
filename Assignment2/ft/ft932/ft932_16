FT  05 JUN 93 / Maxwell settlement may be speeded up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK

<TEXT>
CITY REGULATORY bodies may use the charges announced on Thursday against
Invesco, the fund management group, to help speed up an out-of-court
settlement to reimburse pension fund money stolen by Robert Maxwell.
The Securities and Investments Board is holding out the prospect of using
its powers under Section 61 of the Financial Services Act, which allows it
to seek restitution for investors against organisations which have breached
investment business rules.
It would be empowered under the act to take court action to recover money as
a result of the 55 charges announced on Thursday against Invesco by the
Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro). The charges detail
breaches of investment regulations.
Invesco agreed to pay a Pounds 750,000 fine and Pounds 1.6m in associated
investigation and legal costs. By admitting the charges - which included
three relating to the Mirror Group pension scheme - it may have strengthened
the case of those seeking recoveries through civil action.
The charges said that Invesco MIM Management, one of the group's companies,
failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns about the way in which
the pension fund assets under its management were being used. Imro has also
passed supporting evidence to back up the charges against Invesco, which
could be subject to legal discovery if court action proceeds.
But SIB is believed to favour informal efforts co-ordinated by the Maxwell
pensions unit, headed by Sir John Cuckney, to reach an out-of-court
settlement with Invesco and other City institutions.
Mr Charles Brady, executive chairman of Invesco, said his company has not
contributed to the unit, which now controls funds to compensate Maxwell
pensioners receiving less than their full entitlements.
He said: 'We are not in a position to comment on the legal action. We will
pursue a solution. We are anxious to put this thing behind us.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / Time Warner maintains its C5 interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the world's largest media company, is believed still to be
interested in taking a stake in the proposed national Channel 5 channel.
The company, with Atlanta-based media group Cox, is waiting for publication
of a report on the future of Channel 5 by the Independent Broadcasting
Authority next month.
A large ITV company might also be interested in joining the loose group of
potential investors. Industry speculation suggests this could be Granada.
Time Warner was a member of Channel 5 Holdings, the only consortium to bid
for the franchise last time. The bid was rejected by the ITC in December,
partly because Time Warner was only able to confirm part of its investment.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had also expressed an interest. But
because of cross-media ownership rules it would have been able to take only
a 5 per cent stake.
The ITC will set out three main options for Channel 5 in next month's
report:
Similar rules to those advertised last time, a channel capable of reaching
around 74 per cent of the UK population.
A narrower option based on separate city television stations.
The development of digital television.
Time Warner advisers are interested in the national Channel 5 option and
believe ways can be found to minimise the need to retune video recorders -
because of interference caused by the Channel 5 signal.

FT  05 JUN 93 / BBC Radio to seek tenders for shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC RADIO 4 plans to 'privatise' programmes such as Gardeners' Question Time
and Feedback - the series that airs listeners' complaints.
These are part of the first slice of Radio 4 programmes to be put out to
tender to the independent production sector.
A total of 150 hours of Radio 4 programmes will be on offer from April 1994.
Proposals are being sought for comedy, history and travel programmes. Radio
3 also plans to take 200 hours a year from independent producers.
BBC Radio is not required to offer a proportion of its output to independent
producers as BBC Television is, but has decided to do so to bring in new
people and fresh ideas.
Mr Michael Green, controller of Radio 4, said yesterday: 'We're looking
forward to the response from the independent sector and hope people will be
excited by the possibilities now being offered.'
The BBC said that, although Feedback would be produced independently from
next year, it would continue to be presented by Mr Chris Dunkley, TV critic
of the Financial Times.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Tory women give Patten chilly reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, faced sharp criticism at the Tory
women's conference yesterday for pressing ahead with the school tests this
summer, but insisted that he remained committed to testing and assessment.
Earlier both the tests and the minister had been defended vigorously by Mr
John Major, who told the conference: 'To opt for the quiet life in education
would be to accept the second-rate.'
The prime minister was applauded when, in a reference to the way Mr Patten
had been booed and heckled earlier in the week, he called for 'good manners'
from headteachers as well as children.
On the last day of its conference, the National Association of Head Teachers
stopped short of passing a motion of no confidence in Mr Patten, but the
government came under renewed attack from Mr David Hart, the National
Association of Head Teachers' general secretary, for 'wasting' Pounds 29.5m
in trying to implement this year's tests.
Mr Patten was unrepentant yesterday, as he argued that it would be
disastrous to suspend the reforms. 'That is why I am committed to
high-quality testing: this year, next year, every year,' he said.
His speech, which acknowledged the difficulties on the 'bumpy road' back
from 1960s education policies but emphasised a determination to streamline
the tests and curriculum, met a cool reception and gained only 20 seconds of
applause.
The conference clearly agreed with him that there should not be industrial
action by teachers, but some delegates were outspoken in saying that
proceeding with the tests in the face of the boycott would be
unsatisfactory.
Mrs Angela Comfort, from Essex, warned that governors and headteachers were
being put in an impossible position over this summer's tests. 'Teachers are
united against the tests, parents are not behind them, independent schools
won't use them,' she said.
Mrs Stella Bye, a teacher in a London comprehensive school, won a warm
reception as she told Mr Patten: 'You have driven me to support union
action, and it breaks my heart.'
Several speakers at the Tory women's conference complained about the
bureaucracy associated with the tests and with the national curriculum, a
theme developed also by Mr Hart, in a fiercely critical speech at his
union's conference in Newcastle upon Tyne.
'It is nothing short of a disgrace to see millions of pounds wasted on
national curriculum bureaucracy and paperwork at the expense of desperately
needed staff, books and equipment in our schools,' he said.
It was made worse, he added, because the Department for Education had also
spent 'some Pounds 2m or more' on 'publicity stunts'.
There was some encouragement for Mr Patten, however, in the standing ovation
given by the head teachers to Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, who has been charged with
reviewing the national curriculum.
Loud applause greeted his comment that 'teachers know best', and his
commitment to do an 'honest job'.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Smith firm on voting change for candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH yesterday set the stage for an autumn showdown with union
leaders over the way the Labour party chooses its parliamentary candidates,
pledging to press 'hard' and 'vigorously' for the introduction of
one-member-one-vote.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, the Labour leader said he was
'very clear' the party had to 'move towards' such a selection system. 'I am
strongly committed to it and I will be arguing for it forcefully,' he said.
Alluding to his recent suggestion that union members who pay the political
levy and who wish to participate in the selection of parliamentary
candidates should be entitled to cut-price membership of the party, Mr Smith
said he wanted to see 'as many trade unionists as possible taking part'.
'This is not a debate about the links between the unions and the Labour
party, it is about the Labour party having a clear democratic basis for
selecting our candidates,' he said.
Mr Smith has turned one-member-one-vote into a test of his own political
credibility but has so far failed to secure the backing of most big unions.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the 860,000-strong GMB general union,
is tomorrow expected to underline his unwillingness to compromise.
His views will be given in the context of a more general denunciation of
Labour's failure to seize the political opportunities provided by the
government's recent problems.
But Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and next year's Labour
party chairman, will today signal his backing for Mr Smith's position. In a
speech to a joint Labour Co-ordinating Committee/Tribune conference in
Sheffield, Mr Blunkett will call on those who supported Mr Smith's election
as leader to 'renew their declaration of allegiance to his leadership'.
Mr Smith expressed confidence that he would win the anticipated vote on the
issue at Labour's autumn conference. 'I believe we can win . . . and I am
determined that that is what we shall do,' he said.
He made no reference yesterday to proposals to weaken or remove the unions'
voting strength in electing the party leader and deputy leader.

SOME traffic could be banned from the City of London to try to combat

Checkpoints would be used to enforce the ban on non-essential vehicles, Mr
Michael Cassidy, City corporation planning chairman, said.
The proposal is still at the 'blueprint' stage, but other measures are
already in hand. These include removing all litter bins until they can be
made bomb-proof and allocating resources for 57 extra police constables.
The corporation began a detailed examination of security after the
Bishopsgate bomb in April.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Christchurch Lib Dems play on Tory popularity dive: A
disused car showroom seems an unlikely setting for a by-election victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIE Rennie, a 25-year-old Scotsman, was yesterday sitting in a disused
car showroom in east Dorset plotting the next big crisis for Mr John Major's
government.
'I never underestimate the Tories,' said Mr Rennie, who will run the Liberal
Democrat's campaign from the showroom at the forthcoming by-election in
Christchurch. 'But even in this constituency, with its massive Tory
majority, we are in with a chance.'
In ordinary times such words would be dismissed as by-election bravado.
Christchurch, a quiet seaside town on the south coast of England would be
seen as a safe sanctuary of the Conservative party.
The late Robert Adley, whose death forced the by-election, had one of the
largest majorities, some 23,000, of any Tory MP in the present parliament.
And Christchurch has one of the largest proportions of pensioners in any
town in the country - most of whom have never thought of voting anything but
Tory in their lives.
The Liberal Democrats will provide the main challenge in the by-election,
and they aren't sitting by waiting for the date to be set, which most expect
will be in July.
Mr Rennie, a veteran of previous contests, could yesterday be seen talking
into a portable telephone, outlining to colleagues the facilities in the
headquarters around him: a 50-place car park for canvassers; sleeping
accommodation for four and the newly arrived shipment of portable
by-election furniture.
But if the local Conservatives feel vulnerable, they aren't showing it.
At the Conservative Association, the president was nowhere to be seen. And
in the Conservative Club next door, Ms Wendy Salter, a bar attendant, was
amused by the suggestion that the Tories could lose. 'It's very, very
Conservative here,' she said.
The apparent reason behind the Conservatives' confidence is that they held
on to all their seats within the Christchurch constituency in the recent
county council elections. However, the Conservatives have a problem in
Christchurch that could be the key to any by-election upset. Pensioners feel
deeply threatened by the government's most unpopular policies.
At the Highcliffe Community Centre, a question to a group of pensioners deep
in a game of bowls about the imposition of value added tax on fuel and the
effect of higher prescription charges brought howls of derision.
'The government put its foot in it by announcing what they would do before
they went ahead and implemented the measures,' said Mrs June Mason, 62,
until now a consistent supporter of the Conservatives. 'I have had a bill
from my dentist to the tune of Pounds 100. I cannot possibly afford that.'
The government's progressive reductions in interest rates, while reducing
negative equity for many houseowners, have also reduced the returns on
pensioners' savings. 'That loss of income has not angered people, but it has
created concerns that were not present before,' said Mr John Cooper, an
independent member of the borough council.
A 50 per cent rise in bankruptcies in the town last year has not helped the
Conservatives' cause, but not everyone blames them for that.
'I am not disappointed with the Conservatives,'said Mr Terry Woodford, 62,
whose French Country Kitchen shop is one of the few retailers still
operating in one of the main shopping centres in the middle of town. 'The
current economic problems would have been difficult for any administration
to avoid,' he added.
A Gallup poll this week revealing Mr Major as the least popular prime
minister since opinion polling began suggests Mr Woodford may be in a
minority. People are wondering whether even this constituency is safe.
The recent cabinet reshuffle, and Mr Norman Lamont's departure as
chancellor, showed little sign of having helped to raise the government's
fortunes.
'Major completely nullified the effect of Lamont's removal the day after it
happened,' said Mr Ray New, a local businessman standing on top of his
22-foot yacht in the local harbour. 'The next day he said that economic
policy would remain unchanged, but change is exactly what we need - in
particular a concrete strategy for industry.'
All these concerns are changing voters' allegiances. Strolling outside the
Conservative Club yesterday, two pensioners said that for the first time in
their lives they would not vote Conservative and that there is a possibility
that the Tory party could lose this contest.
But is the tide strong enough to overturn a gargantuan majority? Mr Rennie
of the Liberal Democrats is confident: 'People do not think Lamont's removal
was enough. They want to use this chance to make the government change its
course or its leader.'

ADMISSIONS to degree courses at the universities and colleges covered by the
Polytechnics Central Admissions System rose 22.2 per cent last year, figures
published yesterday show, John Authers writes.
The figures, achieved in spite of a reduction in the number of 18-year-olds,

However, the committee added that applications may have been boosted by the

The Department for Education said: 'This will be seen as evidence of the
wisdom in getting rid of the binary divide between universities and
polytechnics.'
It warned that the increase would not be continued this year because the
government has cut the tuition fees it pays to universities for each
student.
Applications rose by about 20 per cent, while the proportion of applicants
with a background solely in A-levels and AS-levels fell. Students coming
from a BTec background accounted for 13.1 per cent of degree course
admissions and a third of HND admissions.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Major to use veto on Euro work councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will use its veto to block the introduction of mandatory works
councils in large trans-European companies, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Major warned that if the controversial draft directive requiring such
companies to set up elected works councils were revived, Britain would
prevent any unanimous agreement needed for approval.
Britain insisted last week that the plan be taken off the agenda for the
meeting of labour and social affairs ministers. It now hopes the threat of a
veto will head off any plans to press ahead with the move during the Belgian
presidency which begins next month.
Speaking at the Conservative women's national conference, Mr Major was
unequivocal in his message to the other 11 EC countries.
'Let me spare them some trouble, let me tell them now: they are wasting
their time. We have a veto on this issue, and I intend that we will use it,'
he said.
While Britain can block the directive under existing EC procedures, once
Maastricht has been ratified and the social protocol comes into effect, the
other 11 countries can introduce it.
Even though the UK has 'opted out' of the social chapter, British companies
could still be affected by the plans, since many have operations in
continental Europe large enough to require them to introduce the new
procedures for their operations outside Britain.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, used his speech at the same
conference to highlight the UK's concern that the EC was making itself
uncompetitive.
He also underlined Britain's continued opposition to the working time
directive passed by the social affairs council.
He told the conference that he was taking over responsibility for women's
issues within the government, but sounded slightly defensive when he
emphasised he would work closely with his predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard.
Last month's reshuffle left Mr Major with the dilemma of putting Mr Hunt in
charge of women's issues or leaving those responsibilities to Miss Ann
Widdecombe, a junior employment minister.

FT  05 JUN 93 / 'Costly' Arts Council criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council, which distributes government support for the arts, is
'cumbersome and costly', according to a report commissioned by Mr Peter
Brooke, the national heritage secretary.
A review of its operations by consultants Price Waterhouse points to several
areas of the activities of the council - which last year distributed Pounds
225m - where savings could be made.
The report says the administrative cost of projects and schemes is high, and
that the council wastes resources with extensive consultations. For every
Pounds 1 in funding delivered to artists through the council and the
regional arts boards, 10p is spent on administration.
Mr Brooke made clear that while he did not regard this as too high, he felt
there was room for improvement. He said: 'I can certainly think of other
organisations which manage to spend large sums of money without spending 10
per cent on administration.'
He said he would consider the contents of the report and consult various
groups over the next few weeks before deciding what action to take.
Mr Brooke added: 'The report is radical and constructive. We are
pre-occupied with getting the maximum amount of money into the hands of the
artists.'
The review says the relationship between the council and the heritage
department is 'ambiguous' in spite of Mr Brooke's commitment to allowing the
council to take its own decisions.
It also concludes that the composition and procedures of the council are
cumbersome and recommends changes including 'streamlining' management teams
and reducing the council's membership.
The review sets out three options for improving the council's operations:
Relatively minor structural changes and a cut in staff numbers of about 20 -
12 per cent of the workforce - to achieve an annual saving of about Pounds
429,000.
Extending the structural changes, shedding almost 40 staff and saving about
Pounds 847,000, but leaving the council basically intact.
Cutting the council to a core of 50 posts, leaving it to buy in expertise
and services from other bodies.
Lord Palumbo, Arts Council chairman, said it would examine the options and
consult regional colleagues before putting its advice to Mr Brooke.

FT  05 JUN 93 / MoD halts work on Tornado F3s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE company caused damage thought to be worth millions of pounds to
RAF Tornado fighters which it was contracted to work on, it emerged
yesterday.
The Ministry of Defence said it cancelled the contract with the company,
Airwork, last week after the RAF discovered damage of 'a very serious
nature' to a number of its Tornado F3s.
It was still assessing the extent of the problem, believed to be in the main
fuselage sections. But it had already concluded that 'the damage would in
certain cases reduce the safe life of the aircraft'.
The ministry said it would 'certainly seek redress' from Airwork, which is
one of the RAF's principal contractors for aircraft maintenance. Remedial
work would be needed to allow the Tornados to fly safely, the ministry
added.
Airwork, based in Bournemouth, Dorset, was carrying out structural
modifications on the fighters at the RAF's St Athan base in South Wales.
Neither the ministry nor the company would say how many aircraft were
affected. But Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said he had been
told 16 out of 18 aircraft involved in the contract were damaged and 12 were
grounded. He called for an inquiry and said all future maintenance should be
handed back to the RAF.
'This is part of the government's market-testing mania which this time seems
to have gone hopelessly wrong,' he said, adding that he would write to the
comptroller and auditor-general 'because the costs involved in this affair
should be made public'.
Airwork, which in the last financial year undertook 49 ministry contracts,
said it was 'disappointed' by the cancellation decision, and said it had 'a
long and successful history of supplying services to the RAF'. It added: 'As
in the case of any potential dispute, the company is not at liberty to
discuss the matter.'
The F3 is the air defence variant of the Tornado bomber, introduced in 1986.
The RAF has about 100 in operational service, with about 60 more in reserve.
The ministry said the incident would not affect the RAF's defence
capability.
Six of the aircraft are involved in enforcing the no-fly zone in Bosnia. The
UK is discussing a deal for Italy to hire some of the RAF's spare F3s as
interim replacements for its Starfighters.
Mr Wyn Bevan, south Wales district officer of the electricians' section of
the AEEU engineering union, said a bid by skilled civilian staff at RAF St
Athan for the F3 work had been ignored by the ministry.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Clinton drops liberal for civil rights job: Black professor
stays loyal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTERED President Bill Clinton yesterday got a helping hand from the
woman he had dropped the night before as his nominee to run the Justice
Department's civil rights division.
As Washington reverberated with condemnations of the president from black,
civil rights and women's groups, Ms Lani Guinier, precise in speech and
dignified in her disappointment beyond all reasonable expectations, stood by
the man she has known as a friend for more than 20 years.
She disagreed with his decision to withdraw her nomination for the job and
said she thought that, had she been allowed to testify before the Senate,
she would have won confirmation. A possible administration 'mistake,' she
said, was to allow her opponents 'to define me in ways my mother would not
recognise'.
But Ms Guinier, flanked by her husband and young son, insisted repeatedly at
a press conference held in the department in which she desperately hoped to
serve that she retained great respect for Mr Clinton and agreed with him
that 'the last thing we need in this country is a discussion on race that
polarises people'.
He still had, she said, 'the opportunity to be a great president,' and she
harboured no doubts about his commitment to 'heal the racial haemorrhaging'
in the country. She was equally effusive in her praise of Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney general, who had continued to support her but who said yesterday
that 'it is now time to move on'.
Mr Clinton, looking quite shattered, had finally pulled the rug from under
her nomination on Thursday evening after what he called a 'most painful'
two-hour White House session with Ms Guinier, now a law professor at
Pennsylvania University.
She had come under attack for academic articles which appeared to promote a
form of proportional representation for ethnic minorities. Though she argued
that her critics misunderstood her, Mr Clinton came to see her as a
political embarrassment, and as the centre of a divisive debate, just when
he is seeking wide Congressional backing on economic issues.
It emerged that Mr Clinton had only read for the first time on Thursday the
academic articles that led to Ms Guinier, who is black, being attacked as 'a
quota queen' who would tinker with the voting rights laws. He said they
contained 'ideas that I myself cannot embrace'. But Ms Guinier simply said
yesterday she was 'flattered' that a president should have read her dense,
abstract articles.
She said, in fact, her steadfast opposition to racial quotas stemmed from
the experience of her father at Harvard in 1929, when he was denied
financial aid, because it had already been offered to one black, and refused
permission to live in dormitories. 'He was the victim of racial quotas,' she
said, 'a quota of one.'
Of the attacks on her, she said, 'I hope we are not witnessing the dawn of a
new intellectual orthodoxy in which thoughtful people can no longer debate
provocative ideas without denying the country their talents as public
servants.'
But the power and authority of her remarks also had to be matched against
the stream of criticisms directed at Mr Clinton and his White House,
especially from the 38 strong congressional black caucus, among the
president's most loyal supporters to date. Some threatened to withdraw
support from his budget package, for which he needs every vote in sight.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH figures released in Brazil yesterday showed a sharp upturn in the
economy, strongly suggesting the country's four-year recession may be over.
According to the Federal Statistics Institute, the economy grew 4.36 per
cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the last quarter of
1992, the biggest increase in a single quarter in 13 years.
The growth was attributed to bumper harvests and an unexpected revival of
domestic consumption, partly because of lower interest rates but also
because of fears that the government would freeze financial assets.
Statistics Institute officials predict gross domestic product growth for
this year of 4 per cent, the highest since 1986.
The government was given a further boost by figures showing car production
has hit a record monthly rate of 124,000.
But the Fipe index of Sao Paulo university registered 29.14 per cent
inflation for May, slightly up on the previous month. Other indices have
been registering inflation rates of above 30 per cent since April.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Sihanouk ditches plans for coalition government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the unpredictable Cambodian leader, yesterday
angrily renounced his new coalition government only hours after creating it,
leaving in a state of confusion the Cambodian and United Nations officials
who are responsible for administering the country.
The prince abandoned his plans in the face of opposition from the royalist
party Funcinpec, led by his son Prince Ranariddh, and suggestions by UN
officials that the move amounted to a bloodless coup d'etat.
Addressing his father in a fax message as 'most venerable Papa', Prince
Ranariddh said he learned of the new government - in which he was supposed
to be deputy prime minister - with 'great surprise'.
Funcinpec won the largest share of the vote in the election organised by the
UN last week, beating the incumbent communist Cambodian People's party, but
to the chagrin of Funcinpec the two parties were given equal powers in
Prince Sihanouk's short-lived government.
The UN has not yet finished counting the votes, and the shape of the new
Cambodian assembly, charged with writing a new constitution and forming an
internationally recognised government under a UN-backed peace plan, is not
yet clear.
Prince Ranariddh, who is apparently either in Bangkok or in a Funcinpec
enclave on the Thai-Cambodian border, accepted in principle the idea of a
coalition, but raised a number of objections.
In particular, he said it would be morally impossible for him to sit next to
certain senior CPP officials because of their responsibility for murdering
innocent Funcinpec members during the election campaign.
He said he would be unable to work with Prince Chakrapong, his estranged
half-brother who is a CPP leader, because Prince Chakrapong wanted nothing
better than his destruction, even his death. Prince Ranariddh also insisted
that the CPP declare its acceptance of the election results.
Prince Sihanouk responded bitterly in another fax, renouncing his new
government and telling his son that he would henceforth leave it to
Funcinpec and the CPP 'to assume responsibility for such bloody and tragic
events as might afflict our unfortunate fatherland and our unhappy people'.
Prince Sihanouk, who normally calls Ranariddh 'my beloved son', addressed
him coldly as 'Royal Highness'.
Cambodians were bemused by these royal manoeuvres. On the black market, the
Cambodian riel soared yesterday morning on news of the coalition to 3,000
riels per dollar from about 4,500 on Thursday, before plunging as the
government collapsed.
As negotiations continued yesterday between the UN and the various Cambodian
factions on an interim arrangement for running the country, diplomats
expressed concern that the existing CPP-led administration - which had been
delighted by Prince Sihanouk's proposal - would be more reluctant than ever
to hand over power.
There were also fears that Prince Sihanouk would lose interest in
reconciling the rival factions after his abortive attempt this week and
would seek refuge at his home in Beijing. 'It's even more unhelpful when
he's away,' said one official of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia.
Negotiations are likely to continue for some time. In the words of another
senior Untac official: 'In Cambodian politics, if you paint yourself into a
corner you can all of a sudden tunnel your way right out of the building.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / US may alter line on chip market share
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US semiconductor manu-facturers are ready to reduce their reliance upon
specific market share targets to open up the Japanese market, US executives
said yesterday in Tokyo.
The US industry's shift from market share goals as a tool to open the
Japanese market comes as the Clinton administration is preparing proposals
to reduce Japan's rising trade surplus. These are expected to rely heavily
upon market share targets, possibly modelled on the 1991 semiconductor
accord between the two countries.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce
secretary, have repeatedly praised the semiconductor arrangement which
centres on a US expectation that its chip manufacturers will achieve a 20
per cent share of the Japanese market.
US producers achieved a share of more than 20 per cent in the final quarter
of last year. At a meeting between representatives of the US and Japanese
semiconductor industry in Tokyo yesterday the two sides did not reaffirm the
20 per cent goal nor did they set a higher target.
Mr Pat Weber, president of the components division of Texas Instruments said
of the market share goal: 'We are moving beyond that. We will not rely upon
it so heavily in future. We will move forward through co-operation and trust
with our Japanese partners and customers.'
US industry executives said they hoped to consolidate the 20 per cent share
achieved late last year and make continuous improvements in penetrating the
Japanese market.
The Japanese side is committed to improving market access but not
necessarily market share. US executives insist the two are synonymous
because improved market access is meaningless unless it leads to higher
market share.
The US producers are hopeful that after temporarily relying upon the market
share goal autonomous forces will help to support the US share.
Mr Weber said growing technological dependence between semiconductor makers,
the increasing sophistication of US semiconductors and the growing number of
cases in which US chips have been designed into newer products should help
to support the US share.
Mr Hadehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba concurred:
'We need alliances because semiconductors are becoming so diverse, we need
mutual interdependence to develop them.'
However, the rise in the US share last year was partly because of
extraordinary efforts undertaken by the Japanese industry late in the year
to increase their use of US components as well as the slump in the Japanese
consumer electronics market. This is dominated by Japanese semiconductors,
while the US share is higher in areas such as computing. As the consumer
market improves in Japan, as it is expected to do later this year, the US
share is likely fall.

FT  05 JUN 93 / HK airport talks make good start

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between Britain and China about financing Hong Kong's multi-billion
dollar airport project, the first since October last year, got off to a good
start yesterday, according to British officials.
They said Chinese negotiators were beginning to get to grips with the issues
of financing the HKDollars 164bn (Pounds 13.85bn) project, although signs
from the first round of talks were not sufficient to convince them that
Beijing wanted to settle the issue quickly.
More than a month ago Hong Kong presented a third financial proposal to the
Chinese which seeks to address Beijing's concerns about the mix of debt and
equity in the project. This appears to have found favour with China.
Hong Kong's plan to build a modern airport, a connecting railway, and other
related projects has been a political football since it was announced in
late 1989 in the wake of the Tiananmen incident in Beijing on June 4 of that
year.
Until recently it was thought to be hostage to the outcome of talks in
Beijing about Hong Kong's political development. However, it appear that
Beijing might have decided to decouple the economic aspects of the colony's
development from its row with Britain about politics.
Work has started on many of the project's nine core public works programmes,
but failure to agree key elements of the financing has cast a cloud over the
Hong Kong government's ability to build the airport proper, and the railway.
By the end of this month funding for the Provisional Airport Authority
(PAA), the body responsible for the airport and its operation, runs out. The
government said yesterday it would go the Legislative Council, the local law
making body, for HKDollars 564m later this month for funds for the PAA to
cover operating costs until spring next year.
In an encouraging development yesterday Mr Tong Galsworthy, Britain's chief
representative to the Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with overseeing
the transfer of Hong Kong to China, indicated that his Chinese opposite
number had raised no objection to extra funding for the PAA.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has already learned to his cost that the 57-43
Democratic majority in the Senate is not enough for him to be confident of
getting legislation passed.
With today's by-election in Texas, however, his margin seems set to shrink
further.
Mr Bob Krueger, appointed to fill the Senate seat left open when Mr Lloyd
Bentsen became treasury secretary, has been trailing far behind his
Republican challenger, Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, and despite a last minute
assault on her character and ethics, is expected to lose in a landslide.
Mrs Hutchison, the current state treasurer, has stuck to campaigning against
higher taxes and against Mr Clinton. Although she appears to have made
little headway among black and Hispanic voters, she has gained some ground
among younger voters, especially women, who have not always relished the
right wing rhetoric of Texas's other senator, Mr Phil Gramm.
She has also won the support of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire,
although Mr Perot's United We Stand organisation, attempting to tread a
tortuous course in order to preserve its tax-exempt status as a supposedly
non-political organisation, insisted that this did not amount to an
endorsement.
Mr Krueger, who has lost two Senate elections before, is an uninspiring
former English professor with neither the conservative gravitas of Mr
Bentsen nor the tough-talking populism of other successful Texas Democrats.
Indeed, Mr Krueger's expected loss may prove less of an embarrassment to Mr
Clinton - although he already has troubles enough - than to Governor Ann
Richards, who anointed him as the Democratic candidate by picking him to be
Mr Bentsen's interim replacement, and who herself faces re-election next
year.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY is seeking to strengthen its air force, so as to offset a potential
threat from Serbia, by buying or leasing fighters from its Nato allies.
The Italian defence ministry has confirmed that discussions have begun with
the US and British governments for the quick supply of at least 50 aircraft.
The Italian air force is examining the suitability of either the General
Dynamics F-16 or the interceptor version of the Tornado multi-role combat
aircraft, in part produced by the Italian defence industry.
This is the first such deal to be considered in recent years for a Nato air
force. No price tag has been put on either purchase or leasing since the
aircraft under discussion are already in the US and UK air force stock.
There has been unofficial talk of a minimum value of L3,000bn (Pounds
1.3bn).
The Italian government has become increasingly concerned in recent weeks
over the belligerent tone of statements from Serb nationalists and military
commanders.
Italy feels vulnerable to the threat posed by the more advanced Russian
aircraft of the Serbian (ex-Yugoslav) air force. Italy is not directly
involved on the ground in former Yugoslavia but has allowed France, the
Netherlands and the US air forces to use its bases to monitor the no-fly
zone over Bosnia.
Italy's front-line fighters are the ageing and dangerous F-104 Starfighters.
Of 180 in the inventory only about 100 are serviceable and even fewer are
fully operational. Two were lost on one day last month.
The prospect of a sale or lease was broached with Mr Les Aspin, US defence
secretary, when he visited Italy this week.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Make or break for the architects of Russia: Yeltsin wants
the right constitution to come out of a meeting starting today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA BEGINS a constitutional convention today to hammer out a new
democratic constitution that will determine not only if the country breaks
with the Soviet past but also if it breaks up altogether.
On the table is a draft constitution produced by President Boris Yeltsin
which gives him sweeping powers, provides a clear executive role for the
government and confines the legislature to handling legislation.
It is designed to reverse the chaos generated by the old Soviet-era
constitution, which made an unwieldy Congress of People's Deputies 'the
supreme organ of state power' and enabled it to hinder the government's
attempts to push through market reforms.
'The new draft makes clear who does what,' said Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
deputy prime minister who took over as chief architect of economic reforms
in December after the Congress dismissed Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister.
Until now, the smaller, standing parliament has had the power to distribute
state funds, the president has been issuing legislation, while the prime
minister has not had enough power to run the government.
The convention, attended by 700 representatives from around the country and
from across the political spectrum, is to be tightly controlled by Mr
Yeltsin's allies, who will head five working groups to iron out defects in
the draft.
With 1,500 amendments already submitted, Mr Yeltsin has ordered the
convention to end in just 10 days, avoiding what he called the 'idle
chatter' characterising the Congress, or full parliament. The latter, along
with the standing parliament elected in the dying days of the Communist era,
would be replaced under the new constitution by a western-style bicameral
parliament, or Federal Assembly.
The new constitution also abolishes the post of vice-president, conveniently
removing the president's now most bitter opponent, Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi.
While parliament yesterday demanded that its own draft proposal for a
parliamentary rather than a presidential republic be merged with the
presidential draft, Mr Yeltsin's young reformist allies see the main purpose
of the meeting as freeing the presidential draft of its defects.
Mr Andrei Makarov, a lawyer who has defended controversial cases including
President Yeltsin's ban on the Communist party, says the draft's main
failing is its lack of an effective system of checks and balances and of a
clear mechanism for solving disputes between the executive, judiciary and
legislative branches of power.
The document is also heavily weighted in favour of the republics and
autonomous territories which were set up by the Bolsheviks to give ethnic
minorities a semblance of statehood, now being taken seriously by them. The
present set-up would reserve half the seats of the upper house, or Council
of Federation, for minorities representing just 18.5 per cent of the
population.
The draft has the merit of enshrining inalienable private property rights
for the first time in Russian history.
The short-term question is how the constitution will be enacted once the
draft is finalised by the Convention.
Strictly speaking, only parliament has the right, under the present
constitution, to introduce a new one. But Mr Yeltsin is using his victory in
the April 25 referendum as an excuse to bypass a parliament which has until
now refused to abandon the old constitution for fear of being dissolved with
it. New parliamentary elections are also due to be held to fill the new
assembly foreseen by the constitution. Mr Yeltsin might opt for a referendum
to adopt his own draft, or for the convening of a special Constituent
Assembly whose only task would be to adopt the constitution.
The really vital question, as both Mr Yeltsin's supporters and enemies
agree, is whether he will endanger plans for Russia to become a genuine
federal state in order to get Russia's 88 regions and republics to adopt the
constitution. The convention is being boycotted by the 89th 'federation
subject' - the autonomous republic of Chechnya, which has declared
independence and where eight people were reported killed yesterday in
fighting between supporters and opponents of the breakaway leader, General
Dzokhar Dudayev.
The leaders of the 22 republics are particularly keen to use the
constitution as a bargaining chip to insist on more political power as well
as control of tax revenues and export earnings, while the regions want to
get any economic concessions granted to the republics.
The federal treaty signed last year dividing up rights and responsibilities
between federal and local authorities is enshrined in the presidential draft
constitution. But the bargaining will centre on specific mechanisms on how
that federal treaty is to be implemented.
Tatarstan has already refused to sign the federation treaty and is getting a
special treaty. Others like Bashkortostan and Yakutia want to collect all
taxes and then pass on some to the centre, as opposed to a system whereby
the federal authorities would levy their own taxes side by side with local
authorities. Some even want to have their own central banks.
Such centrifugal tendencies, if allowed to get out of hand, will not only
harm efforts to build a market economy, but could ultimately lead to a
Soviet-style collapse of Russia.

INTERNATIONAL mediators met Bosnia's Moslem President Alia Izetbegovic in
Sarajevo yesterday in a bid to end fighting between former Moslem and Croat
allies, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
But Mr Mate Boban, the leader of Bosnian Croat forces, failed to arrive
later for a meeting with envoys Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg after
bad weather grounded his helicopter.
The meeting, due originally at Sarajevo airport, will take place in the
Croatian port of Split in the near future.
Lord Owen reaffirmed his faith in a peace plan that would share power
roughly on ethnic lines between Moslems, Serbs and Croats in 10 provinces,
and said the Serbs faced many pressures to accept a just solution to the
war.
He said he had intended to spend 'all day trying to put Bosnian Moslems and
Croats into a working relationship to stop them fighting each other and get
them to accept parts of the Vance-Owen peace plan'.
The peace effort has been complicated since January by fighting between
Moslems and Croats, previously allied against rebel Serbs who took up arms
when Bosnia broke from Yugoslavia 14 months ago.
The mediators met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Thursday in Pale
near Sarajevo for the first time since his self-proclaimed Serb republic
rejected a blueprint drafted by Owen and former envoy Cyrus Vance to end the
war.
Mr Karadzic agreed to allow UN military observers into the eastern Moslem
enclave of Gorazde, under fresh Serb attacks for the past week. But Lord
Owen said little progress had been made on establishing six UN-protected
'safe areas' for besieged Moslems.

<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday insisted that his government
remained committed to becoming a non-nuclear state, contradicting Prime
Minister Leonid Kuchma's assertion on Thursday that the Slav republic
should, at least temporarily, retain some of its nuclear missiles.
However, the Ukrainian parliament not the president must ratify the two
international treaties which would bind Ukraine to its non-nuclear promises.
Yesterday an overwhelming majority of MPs appeared to favour the prime
minister's more hawkish stance.
Deputies said that in a closed parliamentary debate on the issue, which
adjourned yesterday afternoon, most speakers called for the Start 1 treaty,
which covers only 130 of the 146 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles left
on Ukrainian territory after the break-up of the Soviet Union, to be
considered separately from accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
That would leave the way open for parliament to back Mr Kuchma's proposal
and declare Ukraine to be, temporarily, a nuclear power.
Mr Kuchma's call for Ukraine to keep some of its nuclear weapons for the
time being - the first time a senior government official has expressed such
a view - and parliament's enthusiastic response threaten a schism over the
nuclear issue at the highest levels of the Ukrainian leadership.
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, is to hold talks with Ukrainian
officials in Kiev tomorrow in the first cabinet-level visit by a member of
the Clinton administration.
The US's initial strategy of treating Ukraine frostily until it followed
through on promises to get rid of its nuclear weapons has now changed, and
now includes more carrot and less stick.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's most prominent opposition leader, was due to
appear yesterday evening before an investigating magistrate, three days
after his arrest while leading an anti-government demonstration.
Mr Draskovic was suffering so badly from the beating he received from riot
police on Tuesday that authorities might be forced to bring charges against
him at his bedside in a prison hospital, his lawyers said.
Mr Draskovic has been accused of inciting his supporters, gathered outside
parliament, to storm the building. However, members of his party, the
Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), deny the accusation, saying he was inside
the building at the time, protesting at the beating of an SPO deputy by a
ultranationalist member of parliament.
The hearing for Mr Draskovic was set to cap a dramatic week in which Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic reasserted his grip on power with an unashamed
display of authoritarianism.
The mood in Belgrade was apprehensive yesterday as new police checkpoints
were set up on roads around the city. For the first time since Mr Milosevic
came to power in 1988, the police were an openly intimidating presence.
The dismissal earlier this week of Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump
Yugoslavia, was followed by unprecedented police violence in breaking up the
demonstration outside parliament, and a move to ban Mr Draskovic's party.
Mr Milosevic renewed his alliance with the radical nationalists, which had
appeared under strain recently, in order to force out Mr Cosic in a
no-confidence vote. Afterwards, Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the Serbian
Radical Party described the Serbian president as 'a real patriot'.
Mr Milosevic is clearly determined to crack down heavily on any attempt by
the opposition to exploit rising popular discontent.
Police reinforcements have been brought in from as far away as Kosovo in the
past three days, diplomatic sources said.
Mr Milosevic has strengthened the Serbian police force by 20,000 men in the
past year, equipping special units with armoured vehicles and helicopters as
well as rocket launchers and other weaponry.
A year of UN economic sanctions has made life in Serbia increasingly
uncomfortable, especially in Belgrade where the effects of large-scale
lay-offs, soaring prices and periodic shortages are most keenly felt.
The opposition has grown weaker since a series of demonstrations last year,
led by the flamboyant Mr Draskovic, demanding an end to the war in Bosnia,
forced Mr Milosevic to call an early election.

<TEXT>
In spite of a slight seasonal decline in unemployment, the number of jobless
in western Germany stood at a record 2.15m for the month of May, a 26 per
cent increase on a year ago, Quentin Peel reports from Bonn.
Overall, the number wholly unemployed in both east and west Germany was
almost 3,245,000, with a jobless rate of 6.9 per cent in the west and 14.4
per cent in the east.
The very modest decline during May confirmed fears that unemployment will
rise by around 500,000 during the course of the year, as the current
recession continues. Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour
office, said the 'economic and structural strains' on the labour market were
still apparent.
Besides the wholly unemployed, there was a drop of 490,000 in the number of
economically active job-seekers in west Germany, and a further 937,000 were
on short-time working.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democratic party in the ruling Bonn
coalition, warned that an 'honest calculation' of unemployment would put it
at around 5m. That was simply intolerable.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Italian local vote may point to shape of political alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL and regional elections on Sunday, involving nearly a quarter to
the Italian electorate, promise to provide the first clues to the new shape
of political alliances, Robert Graham writes from Rome.
The elections involve 10.5m voters asked to elect 1,230 municipal councils,
six provincial administrations and one regional council. Local results in
Italy have closely mirrored those of general elections.
For the first time, the electorate will be voting directly for mayors, there
will be only one polling day instead of the usual two.
The introduction of direct elections for mayors has completely changed the
nature of the municipal contests, forcing political parties to forge broad
alliances to be sure of a reasonable chance of winning.
The mayors must obtain a majority of the vote to win the first round but,
because most contests are at least three-cornered, even the greater use of
electoral alliances means that many municipalities will see a run-off on
June 20.
The main interest has focused on the outcome of the contests in the two big
northern industrial cities of Milan and Turin.
The latest opinion polls say voters are likely to protest strongly against
the misuse of municipal authority which has been exposed by the recent
corruption scandals. The three largest cities involved in the elections on
Sunday - Catania, Milan and Turin - are being run by commissioners because
the political parties cannot find stable alliances to rule.
In Milan, the mayoral front-runner is Mr Nando Dallo Chiesa, candidate of
The Network (La Rete), the leftist movement for clean government backed by a
broad group of left-wing parties, including the two sectors of the former
communist party and the Greens.
A similar alliance could ensure The Network candidate wins in Turin.
The Christian Democrats and Socialists look set to be hammered in the north
of Italy.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Bundesbank attack on 'sham' proposals for changes in EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT suggestions for adapting the European Monetary System were dismissed
yesterday as 'deceptive. . . sham proposals' by Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
vice-president of the Bundesbank.
He was particularly antagonistic to notions that German monetary policy must
pay greater attention to conditions in the entire EMS area and that Germany
should agree to increase intramarginal intervention in order to defend fixed
central exchange rates.
In his view, this was neither acceptable in Germany, where policy is
controllled by the Bundesbank, nor in the best interests of other EMS member
states, he told an international audience in Frankfurt last night.
The Bundesbank, which has drawn fresh international and domestic fire for
its renewed reluctance to ease interest rates in the interests of helping
the EC, including Germany, to escape from recession, 'must and will do all
it can to safeguard the anchor function of the D-Mark,' he said.
Success in this task depended mainly on maintaining the credibility of
Germany's domestic anti-inflation policy, which was the only way of
safeguarding stability in the entire system.
Proposals for an early shift to monetary union by the so-called 'hard-core'
group were also blighted by substantial institutional differences, political
uncertainty and economic divergences, Mr Tietmeyer observed.
There were considerable disparities between the 'stable' Community
countries, especially in public sector budgets and labour market conditions.
Germany had particular difficulties with the economic adjustment to
unification, a process which had started relatively late, he noted. The
Community should abide by the timetable set down in the Maastricht treaty,
which provided for an initial review at the end of 1996.
Mr Tietmeyer, expected to succeed Mr Helmut Schlesinger as Bundesbank
president this year, said modifying the economic convergence criteria
governing potential participants in monetary union would be a 'fateful
mistake'.
Easier conditions would discredit and threaten the stability of the future
European currency even before it came into existence.
He also criticised more recent suggestions for softening EMS rules by
extending permissible margins of exchange rate fluctuation and allowing the
temporarily over-stepping of intervention points. A monetary system fitted
with loopholes 'for all possible contingencies will hardly be able to fulfil
its purpose as an instrument of discipline,' he said.
He also warned against the 'artificial' development of the Ecu into a
parallel currency. In this context, measures to promote the use of the Ecu,
recently reactivated by the EC Commission, could adversely affect member
states' monetary policies.

THREE MORE suspects were detained by the German federal prosecutor yesterday
for questioning over the murder of two Turkish women and three children in
an arson attack last weekend, as preparations went ahead for mass
anti-racist demonstrations across the country.
Tens of thousands of Germans and Turks are expected to join in the protests
at Solingen, the steel-making town where the deaths occurred, and other
cities such as Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
There were fears yesterday that there could be violence, with clashes
between extreme Turkish nationalist groups, such as the so-called Grey
Wolves, Kurdish dissidents, and German skinhead gangs.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, warned a parliamentary committee the
Solingen attack could trigger new confrontations between extreme-left and
extreme-right gangs.
However, the organisers are calling for a mass demonstration in favour of
good race relations. In Hamburg, for example, they are hoping for 100,000
people in a 'chain of ideas', each with a proposal on how to combat racism.
A survey out yesterday showed that an overwhelming majority of Germans -
more than 70 per cent - would be happy to grant long-standing Turkish
residents the right of dual nationality. At the same time, some 44 per cent
of those questioned by the Wickert opinion research institute doubted that
such a dual nationality would do much to improve race relations.
There was a significant drop last month in the number of foreigners seeking
political asylum in Germany - a main source of racial tension over the past
two years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday formally agreed to write off 40 per cent
of its DM175m (Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the troubled German
steelmaker, clearing the way for a far-reaching debt relief scheme at the
group.
The Commission claimed it had managed to improve Klockner's original offer
of capacity cuts so that the debt relief scheme would not upset wider EC
plans to support the Community steel industry.
However, Klockner said yesterday that it had not changed its plans during
the month-long negotiations, and that the Commission had simply accepted the
original conditions for the debt rescheduling.
In Duisburg, Klockner said the EC had accepted the planned capacity cuts in
its original restructuring plan. 'We convinced the EC that our plans were
viable,' Mr Bernd Kruger, a director in the company, said. Klockner said,
however, it had agreed to cut 400 more jobs than planned. The company will
bring its current workforce of 6,200 down to 4,100 by the end of 1994.
The company said the way was now cleared for its debt rescheduling scheme to
go through.
Klockner, which filed for protection from its creditors earlier this year,
will have DM1.7bn of its DM2.4bn net debt written off. In return, the
Commission said yesterday it had won binding commitments from the German
group to close down one blast furnace in its Bremen steel plant.
Under the deal, pig-iron capacity will be cut by 33 per cent, and crude
steel capacity by 20 per cent. Capacity at the group's hot strip rolling
mill will come down by 500,000 tonnes a year, from 4.2m tonnes to 3.7m
tonnes.
Klockner has also promised to cut capacity in line with overall EC plans if
it enters into partnership with any other steel producers.

THE POLISH government will press on with its mass privatisation programme,
despite a parliamentary elections set for September 19, Ms Hanna Suchocka,
prime minister, has confirmed, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The programme was approved by the now-dissolved Polish parliament and the
government hopes to have it in operation by the beginning of next year, as
planned.
Meanwhile, the government is seeking to limit delays to implementation of
its mass privatisation plan. A crucial element is the selection of 20
investment funds (NFIs), run by foreign and domestic managers, which will
own up to 600 state sector enterprises.
Shares in the NFIs funds are to sold early next year for a nominal sum to
all adult Poles who apply.
Western commercial bankers in the London Club have asked for a postponement,
till the end of this month, of a meeting planned for next Wednesday in Paris
to negotiate a cut in Poland's Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 7.8bn) bank debt.
Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's chief debt negotiator, said yesterday that
the delay was to give the banks time to digest the results of a report
commissioned by them on the condition of Poland's economy. The request for
the delay was 'a good sign' that the next round of talks would be well
prepared, he added.

THE subsidies committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
yesterday decided to set up an independent disputes panel to hear the
European Community's complaint against countervailing duties imposed by the
US on imports of some European steel products.
The EC said yesterday the US system for calculating subsidies and
compensating duties had 'lost touch with reality'. Punitive duties had been
imposed where no subsidies existed, and the amount of the alleged subsidy
was 'excessively inflated' by 'artificial comparisons and arbitrarily chosen
benchmarks'.
The panel investigation, which is to be completed within 60 days, will look
at the US methods of calculating the definitive countervailing duties
imposed last January on imports of certain hot rolled lead and bismuth
carbon steel products worth Dollars 19m a year from France, Germany and
Britain.
Provisional countervailing duties on other steel products, yet to be
confirmed, are not included in the panel inquiry.

FT  05 JUN 93 / The pursuit of happiness can lead to a red Ferrari, and to
early middle-age: Nicholas Denton finds Hungary's Young Democrats filling
their coffers oddly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL a retired Hungarian manual worker receives in a year as state pension is
the equivalent of Dollars 1,000. This sum can also hire a red Ferrari 348ts
 -including tax, mileage and heated leather seats - from Budapest's luxury
rental company Jet Car - for a day.
Such is eastern Europe's jarring capitalism. But Jet Car is owned by
Hungary's Young Democrats and car hire earnings may cost the fresh-faced
opposition liberals dear in public affection.
Renting out Ferraris - and Porsches, Rolls-Royces, optional chauffeurs and
bodyguards - is a lucrative business in status-conscious Hungary and meshes
with the twenty-something liberals' unembarrassed faith in 'freedom for the
pursuit of happiness in a free market economy.'
Still, such conspicuous extravagance is galling for the losers, often
embittered and envious, from Hungary's painful transition to the free
market.
The Young Democrats accept that ownership of Jet Car is politically damaging
 -particularly so because the Young Democrats and their leader Mr Viktor
Orban (pictured left) began in politics as idealistic anti-communist student
radicals and it is their youthful innocence that took them to the top of the
opinion polls.
The image of purity, an appealing one in a country which assumes most
politicians are corrupt, is now tarnished and jibes that the Young Democrats
are a bunch of 'yuppies disguised as revolutionaries' have gained bite.
For it has emerged also, in the last fortnight, that the Young Democrats
have funded their business ventures out of a Ft700m (Dollars 8m) property
windfall obtained by slick manipulation of Hungary's party financing laws.
The scandals matter because the Young Democrats, with 8.9 per cent of the
vote in 1990, may hold the balance of power after elections next year.
Already putting out feelers are the governing conservatives of the Hungarian
Democratic Forum, unpopular and weakened by the breakaway this week of
extreme nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka.
The Young Democrats' influence in power-broking depends on their electoral
chances and advisers reckon the scandals will cost up to 10 percentage
points in the polls.
Even so, more money in party coffers is essential if the Young Democrats are
to mount an effective campaign in 1994, officials say privately.
As for loss of innocence - well, age catches up with everyone. The Young
Democrats recently lifted the party ban on middle-aged members. Their
posters had the grace to admit: 'We're getting older.'
At least adulthood has its compensations. Jet Car only rents out its Ferrari
to over-25s.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Fear and loathing in las elecciones: Peter Bruce tastes the
last offerings by the leaders in the Spanish poll campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two main political leaders in Spain, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist
prime minister, and his conservative challenger, Mr Jose Mara Aznar,
president of the People's Party, may have a lot to answer for.
During a month-long campaign, leading to the general election tomorrow, the
closest and nastiest since the country became a democracy 16 years ago, they
have dragged fear and loathing back to the heart of Spanish politics.
At political rallies around the country this week, it has been possible to
catch just a scent of the passions that tore at the second republic in the
1930s, before the Civil War, as the country was divided into left and right.
The socialists have been selling fear; the conservatives doing the loathing.
Not that anything terrible is going to happen after the polls close. Power
will be peacefully retained or peacefully - if a little chaotically -
transferred. But nearly 80 per cent of the electorate is expected to vote, a
measure of the passions ignited.
The rallies are huge. In Valencia, Mr Aznar tells 30,000 roaring supporters
bussed in from the countryside that the socialists are corrupt, that the
country is on the brink of collapse, and that the time has come to 'get them
out of the way'.
An evening later, in Barcelona, Mr Gonzalez asks more than 40,000
supporters, next to the city's Olympic stadium, 'what do they mean 'get rid
of us'? This is a democracy. We don't 'get rid' of people.'
Desperate to stop the PP winning enough votes to enable it to form Spain's
first conservative government in more than a decade, the Socialists
blatantly play on the fears - particularly those of old people - of a return
of fascism and dictatorship. In Barcelona, Mr Gonzalez makes a surprise
reference to el viejo (the old man), meaning Franco and thus uttering a term
he has not used for ages.
Celebrities at the Barcelona rally drench the crowd with the past. A rock
singer says his father was persecuted by Franco. A huge roar goes up as the
Colombian writer and Nobel prize-winner Gabriel Garca Marquez is introduced
and embraces Mr Gonzalez. A humorist remembers leaving a POW camp after the
Civil War and being told not to fear the dictatorship. 'Two days later, I
was back in Franco's jails,' he cries. 'Don't trust them] There is no 'new'
right, it is the same old right it always was.'
Felipe's eyes moisten. He is a sentimental old anti-Francoist who also did
his time in exile. As he speaks, he struggles to control what is in his
heart and then stops bothering. In Spain, 40,000 people begging for the good
guy to give the bad guys what for is called 'bathing in the masses'. No
politician would resist it.
The scare-mongering ranges from warning old people that PP tax policies
threaten their pensions, parents that the conservatives will run down public
education, and the infirm that Mr Aznar will make it expensive to be ill. 'I
am not saying that democracy is in danger on June 6,' roars Mr Gonzalez,
'but tolerance is being threatened by intolerance. We cannot build a future
by forgetting the past.'
This enraptured crowd would probably vote socialist even if he were speaking
Norwegian so it may not matter what he says. Little of the speech would get
onto television. But the more Mr Aznar has looked like winning, the more
strident Mr Gonzalez has become.
The right started it, though. For nearly two years, expectantly watching the
approach of economic recession, the PP and its supporters in the media and
business have carefully sold a toxic portrait of economic disaster and
unbridled socialist corruption to Spain. Language has hardened. One hears
respectable businessmen speak of the socialists as 'thieves' or 'idiots'.
They are neither, but more than a decade in power and rising unemployment
have lubricate conservative propaganda. Spaniards are disposed to be
suspicious of politicians anyway and it was not cold economic fact that
forced Mr Gonzalez to call the election early - it was his sense that
somehow the country's body politic was being poisoned.
If the PP wins the most seats, as the polls predict, tomorrow, Mr Aznar will
have to deal with the same problem, even though he may have the comfort of
governing in coalition or some partnership with smaller regional parties.
The nastiness generated by this campaign will not subside quickly and he
will be given no quarter by an opposition led by Mr Gonzalez.
Felipe Gonzalez will still be around, win or lose. He loves politics - but
there was an air in Barcelona of something ending. He is the last socialist,
the last sixties radical, still running a European Community country.
Watching him choke up 40,000 people with his rhetoric is still
knee-weakening, but listening to him claw back the past was like being at
the last Beatles concert.
THE SPANISH POLL
VOTERS/CONSTITUENCIES:
30.7m Spaniards can vote in elections for the 350-seat Congress (lower
house) and for 208 of the 252 seats in the Senate. The remaining senators
are designated by the autonomous regions.
More than 800 candidates are standing for Congress and 777 for the Senate,
with a record 92 parties putting forward lists in Spain's 52 constituencies.
There are four Senate seats available in almost all the 52 constituences,
regardless of the size or population of the area.
By contrast, areas with greater concentrations of voters elect
correspondingly more deputies for Congress. The largest constituency is
Madrid, where 34 Congress seats are on offer. The smallest two are Spain's
North African enclaves, Melilla and Ceuta, which elect one deputy each.
VOTING SYSTEM:
Under Spain's proportional representation system, parties put up a list of
candidates in each constituency - as many candidates as there are seats.
The number of seats won corresponds approximately to the percentage of votes
obtained. If a party wins 50 per cent of the vote it will get 50 per cent of
the seats, with candidates from the top half of its list automatically
elected.
Voting is not compulsory. In the 1989 general elections there was a 69.7 per
cent turnout.

FT  05 JUN 93 / UN approves force to protect Bosnian 'safe areas'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night approved a plan agreed in Washington last
month to send international troops to protect six Moslem enclaves in Bosnia
designated as 'safe areas'.
The plan is expected to require some 5,000 extra UN troops in addition to
the 9,000 now engaged in humanitarian operations in Bosnia.
For the first time, the council authorised UN troops to use force in reply
to any bombardment of the safe areas or to carry out armed incursions.
Member states, in co-operation with the UN, would also be authorised to use
air power in and around the safe areas to support UN peacekeepers.
The UN decision came as Bosnian Serb forces overran two villages near the
Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.
After two weeks of intense backstage negotiations, the US, Britain, France,
Russia and Spain - which drew up the plan at a foreign ministers' meeting -
managed largely to stem criticism by non-aligned members.
Thirteen states voted for the resolution. Pakistan and Venezuela abstained.
The US described last night's move as an intermediate step towards
countering Serb aggression.
The resolution called on member states to contribute forces and empowered Mr
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, to seek additional contingents.
A number of Islamic states, including Pakistan, have offered soldiers, but
so far Mr Boutros-Ghali has not wanted to employ them. Nato is ready to
assume a co-ordinating role for the air operations.
British officials played down apparent differences between the US and
European governments over the specific role of air strikes. They said they
were 'reasonably content' with the language of the resolution.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian delegate, denounced the resolution, saying
that by designating a few protected havens the Council implicitly declared
'open season on the majority of our towns and citizens who don't happen to
fall into safe areas.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / Pension fund move to limit directors' contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, the UK's biggest pension fund, has warned UK companies that it
intends to vote against the re-election of any company director who is on a
rolling contract of more than 12 months, a move designed to reduce the size
of corporate pay-offs.
In a powerfully worded letter to the chairmen of all the FT-SE 100
companies, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, which
controls Pounds 20bn and has a stake in each of the companies, says: 'Too
often recently we have read of senior executives who have been deemed to
have failed in their role but, as a consequence of their contract, have been
paid off with substantial sums.'
He continues: 'I have been given to understand that several other large
investment institutions will support this initiative.'
Mr Ross Goobey, a former adviser to Mr Norman Lamont, says he is not taking
a position on the 'absolute level of executive salaries', which he says is a
matter for companies' remuneration committees.
He adds: 'A fixed (and renewable) contract of up to three years gives us no
qualms'. But says that, with rolling contracts, there is no point at which
an executive's employment can be terminated at 'anything other than a high
cost to the employer'. Company law allows directors to be appointed for up
to five years and longer if shareholders agree. The Cadbury Committee on
corporate governance urged last year that contracts be cut to three years.
Mr Ross Goobey said that Cadbury had 'fudged' this issue.
Mr Ross Goobey's campaign received support from Mr Derek Bonham, chief
executive of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, who said: 'Directors should
deliver or get out. They should be on one year contracts as is the practice
at Hanson.'
But the chairman of another company complained: 'Fund managers are becoming
more pompous all the time. They are out of touch with the real world of
business'. Mr Ross Goobey says: 'It is up to representatives of the owners
to change a situation which is coming a burden on companies.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / Major seeks to placate right: PM aims to avoid tax rises and
vows - 'I am here and I am staying'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR signalled yesterday that the government would aim for spending
cuts rather than tax increases in the November Budget in an effort to
placate the disgruntled right of the Conservative party.
He scorned suggestions that his premiership was threatened with a crisis of
confidence, but acknowledged that the government faced tougher times ahead.
Dismissing reports that a collapse in the government's support had left him
tired and depressed, he told the Conservative Women's conference in London:
'I am fit, I am well. I am here and I am staying.'
Mr Major's insistence that he would not quit followed a Gallup survey
showing him to be the most unpopular British prime minister since polling
began more than 50 years ago.
But he launched a broadside against the criticism he has faced in the press:
'What I am tired and weary of is gossip dressed up as news, malice dressed
up as comment and fiction reported as fact.'
His speech drew a warm, if less than ecstatic, reception. But the
unpopularity of some of the government's policies, even among its own
supporters, was underlined later by the rough ride given to Mr John Patten,
education secretary.
Mr Patten - jeered earlier this week at a conference of head teachers - was
sharply criticised by representatives over his confrontation with teachers
on school tests.
Mr Major's comments were calculated to calm criticism from his party's right
wing since he made Mr Kenneth Clarke chancellor of the exchequer in place of
Mr Norman Lamont. Dropping his more customary 'heart of Europe' rhetoric, Mr
Major took a swipe at Brussels. He said Britain would continue the political
and legal fight against the directive passed this week stipulating a 48-hour
working week.
Mr Major warned that the government would veto another European Commission
proposal to introduce compulsory works councils in all businesses with more
than 1,000 employees.
Amid fears on the right that the centrist Mr Clarke may be ready to raise
income taxes to curb the government's huge borrowing requirement, Mr Major
gave a clear signal that the new chancellor would instead focus on cutting
public spending.
In the March Budget, the government had set out a clear strategy covering
the next three years to increase revenue. Mr Major went on: 'The main task
now is to keep a firm grip on public spending to help bring the books
towards balance.'
He went out of his way to reaffirm the government's medium to long-term aim
of further income tax cuts. Pinning his political future on hopes that
economic recovery is gathering pace, Mr Major committed the government to
'policies that will sustain the recovery - low taxes on larger profits and
more incomes with more people in work'.
In spite of threats from the anti-Maastricht right of the Tory party that a
defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election might prompt an autumn
challenge to his leadership, Mr Major said there was no short cut to
increased popularity.
Acknowledging that attempts to contain public spending would provide fertile
ground for opposition 'scare' stories, he insisted that the government would
stick to its principles whatever the short-term cost: 'We have persistence.
What we start out we complete - however tough the prospects may be.'
Referring to the forecasts of doom that had preceded last year's general
election victory, he added: 'It would have been easy to give up then but we
didn't. We didn't do it then. We haven't done it since. And we are not going
to do it now.'
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described the speech as the 'same tired
old dirge - no changes on policy despite the mishandled changes in his
government'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'He is
pursuing policies which are deeply unpopular in the country, with the Tory
party desperately - some say terminally - divided.'

FT  05 JUN 93 / Cash instead of cars would benefit most UK executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY six out of 10 UK executives would be better off after next April by
handing back their company cars in exchange for extra pay and a mileage
allowance to run their own cars, according to what is claimed to be the
largest survey of the UK company cars sector.
Almost one third would gain by more than Pounds 750 a year, according to
employee benefits specialist Stoy Benefit Consulting.
The London-based group received detailed responses from 5,400 companies,
operating a combined total of 189,000 cars, in reaching its conclusions.
The study, compiled over many months, was commissioned by Volkswagen/Audi in
an attempt to determine the detailed impact of a new Inland Revenue taxation
regime for company cars which comes into effect next April.
It assumes an executive receives an extra payment equivalent to what it
costs the company to run the car. The cost to the company would remain the
same.
The new Revenue regime will tax the private benefit to employees of company
cars according to simple sliding scales based on new cars' list prices. It
will replace a long-standing but complex price and engine capacity banding
taxation system. However, Stoy Benefit's managing director, Mr Brian
Friedman, made clear yesterday that the study was not recommending a mass
exodus by executives from company cars.
The other 43 per cent would benefit from retaining their company cars -
nearly one quarter of these also by Pounds 750 a year or more.
'While the company car may not be universally as tax effective as it once
was, there are still many for whom it remains so,' according to Mr Friedman.
'The government's policy towards the taxing of company cars may therefore be
said to have been effective in producing the much more balanced position
revealed by the survey.'
The survey was aimed wholly at executives, paying tax at the higher rate on
cars which traditionally, if often inaccurately, have been regarded as
'perks'. They account for around one tenth of all company cars. There is no
simple formula for individuals to calculate whether they will be better or
worse off by giving up their company car. Which category they will fit
depends on individuals' annual business mileage, individual taxation
position and other factors.
In general those most likely to benefit from handing back their company cars
are currently driving executive cars priced at close to the current Pounds
19,250 price threshold for higher taxation.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Miners plan W Australian gas
pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OF Australia's leading mining companies, Western Mining Corporation,
BHP Minerals and Normandy Poseidon, have lodged a proposal to build a
ADollars 400m (Pounds 175m) gas pipeline to link Western Australia's gas
fields with the state's mineral production centres.
The three companies announced yesterday they had formed a joint venture
called Goldfields Gas Transmission in response to an invitation from the
Western Australian government.
The envisaged pipeline would transmit gas from the North West Shelf region
to the state's gold and other metal projects along a route stretching more
than 1,500 km to the south-east.
The chairman of the GGT management committee, Mr Don Morley, said yesterday
that the purpose of the pipeline, which would be built and funded by the
private sector, was to reduce energy costs.
'This is complementary to the interests of the joint venturers in GGT whose
collective energy needs represent between 75 and 90 per cent of the initial
pipeline loads,' he said.
Mr Morley said the GGT proposal envisaged that third parties would have
access to the pipeline at fair tariffs. Other parties would also be
considered for direct participation in the project.
GGT was prepared to begin environmental and aboriginal heritage studies on
the pipeline route immediately if the Western Australian government approved
the project, Mr Morely said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) The Property Market: Controversial cornerstone -
The upwards-only rent review is a pillar of property investment. But it must
be reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 11th June 1993) appended to this article.
When Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the out-going governor of the Bank of
England, recently remarked that 'upwards-only rent review clauses seem
designed for a world which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of
property values', he touched a raw nerve.
It was 'an uninformed, impoverished statement that was greatly damaging to
the industry', said Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, the UK's
fourth-largest property company by market capitalisation, at about Pounds
700m.
But Mr Ritblat can no longer turn a blind eye to what is an increasingly
controversial cornerstone of property investment: that the upwards-only rent
review is in need of reform.
The origins of the upward-only rent review clauses go back several decades.
Until 40 years ago there were virtually no reviews built into leases.
Originally leases were for 999 years or 99 years. These treble and double
nines were later known as straight leases; that is, the same rent, often a
peppercorn, was paid throughout the entire period.
The fight for stepped increases was launched by property analyst George
Bridge of the Legal and General. He was supported by the Coal Board Pension
Fund whose property adviser was Aubrey Orchard-Lisle of Healey and Baker,
the property consultants.
Their campaign was prompted by the large number of sales and leasebacks on
behalf of the big retailers of the day such as Montague Burton, Charles
Clore, Hugh Fraser and Edward Erdman. These retailing tycoons raised large
sums by selling the freeholds of their stores and leasing them back for 99
years; they then resold their 99-year leases but then renegotiated shorter
leases.
Such activity in retail properties fuelled the initial impetus of the
property upsurge of the early 1960s. Retail shares on the stock exchange
soared while the shares of property companies climbed to similar levels.
The fact that institutions such as the Coal Board were losing out on the
so-called straight leases incensed Mr Bridge.
In the face of fierce opposition from the retailers, Mr Bridge insisted on
stepped increases, first every 33 years, then every 21, l4, and seven years.
Eric Young, head of the Coal Board's property department, remarked years
later that: 'It may sound ridiculous to think that we were sweating to get
reviews at 33 and 66 years, but in this way we made a start.'
In fact, property investment companies went much further than the
institutions, introducing what has come to be known as the five-year
upwards-only rent review clause. This now notorious clause was designed not
so much to come to terms with inflation but to evaluate the exact amount of
rent to be paid on review, the evaluation being based upon 'comparables',
that is current market rents.
The increase in rental values dictated by the market could therefore be
greater than the rate of inflation. In other words with more demand than
supply and with, say, zero inflation, the rent review could still operate
upwards.
Moreover, if the upwards-only review clause had been inflation-linked as is
customary on the continent and not upon 'comparables' (only new leases being
subject to market forces), this would also have brought to an end the
expensive renegotiations on 'comparables' every five years. This argument
every five years over reviewing 'comparables' has been a curse of the
property industry.
So whereas the original institutional pioneers fought to seek redress
against inflation, property owners, characteristically, went straight for
market forces. They did well and continued to do so until the property crash
of the 1970s.
Market forces have since caused havoc and we are now enduring possibly the
worst property slump for some six decades.
Landlord power is much reduced; tenant power is strident, making exceptional
demands and obtaining unprecedented concessions. Undue tenant power is
poison to a well-regulated property investment market and, ominously, there
are signs of long-term structural changes - break clauses, short-term
leases, and, for the first time, upwards and downwards rent review clauses.
The upwards-only rent review has become academic, at least for the
foreseeable future. And with the relatively new phenomenon of over-renting -
where the current rent is much more than the rent that would be agreed in
the open market - growth prospects have declined so far that the income from
a property investment often resembles that of a fixed-interest stock.
Purchases and sales have become more like financial transactions than
property deals. Many institutions and entrepreneurs must be wondering why
they ever went into property.
Institutions which were attracted to property investment for its long-term
combination of rising income plus capital appreciation, are now wary of
relying on what many believed to be inevitable rental increases.
Their sums will need to be reworked on the basis that property investment,
the hybrid between fixed interest and equities, is, in today's global
markets, more attractive as a fixed-interest stock than as an equity.
The upwards-only rent review, the reviled equity aspect of property
investment, will prove to be of lesser importance than a higher initial
yield; and the original aim to counter inflation may become the yardstick
instead of 'comparables'. The governor of the bank of England may yet have
the last laugh.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Volvo takes over food group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker, yesterday
resolved an 18-month dispute over the future of Procordia, the food and
drugs group, by agreeing to split the company in two with Volvo taking over
the food and consumer products side of the business.
In a share swap deal, to be completed in the autumn, the government will
become the majority shareholder in Procordia's pharmaceutical and
biotechnology businesses, including 51 per cent of Erbamont, an Italian
drugs company acquired in May from Italy's Montedison. Volvo, Sweden's
biggest industrial group, will take a 74 per cent share in the demerged
non-drug Procordia units, and seek to buy the remaining 26 per cent held
publicly.
It will retain a 25 per cent stake in Procordia's pharmaceutical operation,
with the option to increase its holding to a maximum of 35 per cent as the
government carries out its plan to privatise its stake over the next 18
months.
Volvo holds 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.8 per cent of its
voting rights, while the state holds 34.2 per cent of the capital and 42.7
per cent of the votes.
The deal ends a prolonged tussle between Volvo and the conservative-led
government, which last year blocked a move by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's
chief, to merge with Procordia to bolster the loss-making carmaker.
It valued the new streamlined Procordia, with sales last year of SKr15.4bn,
at SKr31.5bn and the hived-off food section - with sales of Skr26bn - at
SKr14.4bn, a combined value of SKr4bn more than Procordia's market value on
Wednesday of SKr42bn.
The Stockholm stock market reacted positively, with Procordia's most-traded
B shares closing up SKr29 at SKr193 at its suspension prior to the
announcement.
Volvo's B shares also moved up SKr16 to close at SKr406. Mr Gyllenhammar
said the deal gave Volvo a profitable new operation with enhanced cash flow.
He said Renault, the French vehicle maker with which Volvo is developing a
deepening strategic alliance, had welcomed the agreement as a strengthening
of its partner.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese begin to think the
unthinkable - Metals companies are casting aside tradition to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE non-ferrous metals industry is facing its worst crisis since
the two oil shocks of the 1970s. The economic bubble of the late 1980s has
well and truly burst leaving the Japanese little choice but to tighten their
obis. Already there are concerns that traditional work practices will not
survive the changes needed to maintain Japan's leading position in an
increasingly international marketplace.
Domestic demand even for the comparatively healthy aluminium and copper
markets has slumped significantly. For example, in 1992 Japanese aluminium
consumption fell for the first time in 11 years, dipping 4 per cent to 3.7m
tonnes, according to the Japanese Aluminium Federation.
The contribution of the seemingly recession-proof aluminium cans sector - up
6.8 per cent last year - was robustly countered by a reduction in the
remaining markets of machinery, building and construction, electric and
telecommunications. The motor industry has been particularly badly affected
with Nissan the first to propose plant closures. As a result, in 1992
aluminium sheet shipments for car manufacture slumped for the first time in
15 years, falling 4.7 per cent to 78,238 tonnes. Extruded products fell 7.6
per cent to 92,688 tonnes - the first decline for six years.
The copper market has fared no better. Domestic consumption was down from
1.6m tonnes in 1991 to 1.4m tonnes last year, compared with output of 1.1m
tonnes. Faced with a 300,000-tonne demand deficit the producers are still
pumping out the metal - but any plans for domestic expansion have been
discreetly shelved. Japan's biggest copper unit, Nippon Mining's Saganoseki
smelter, is conveniently waiting to see the results of a feasibility study
before committing itself to cranking up production.
In its traditional way Japan is doing all it can to make the best of the
situation and save face. In most cases the 'job for life' tradition is being
upheld, although the 'job for the wife' is another matter. Part-time workers
 -usually married women working eight-hour days - and immigrant labourers
have been the first to lose their jobs in the initial wave of
rationalisation.
As a result Japan saw its first decline in people employed in seven years in
February, with the figure falling 250,000 - or 0.4 per cent - to 62.8m.
Leading the way with lay-offs are western companies like IBM, which have had
less compunction about cutting back staff to meet decreased demand.
At the moment, for the worst-afflicted industries - like secondary
(recycled) aluminium, of which the motor industry is a major consumer, and
the ferro-alloys that go into the ailing steel industry - production cuts
are the answer. The major aluminium alloy producers have reduced output by
10-15 per cent and few will report healthy profits for 1993.
Daiki Aluminium, Japan's leading producer, registered a loss for 1992, the
first in its operating history. In response the company, which at 200,000
tonnes-a-year has the world's greatest capacity, has slashed output by 15
per cent and workers have already left volunatrily.
According to executive vice-president Mr Takaari Yamamoto, the second
quarter of this year will see more serious restructuring. Mr Yamamoto, who
is set to take over the helm from his father, suggested some of the smaller
smelters could close.
'This is a time of change for the kitchen shop smelters. A new generation is
taking over,' he said, suggesting that some of the sons in line for the
dubious inheritance of an ailing secondary smelter might grab the yen and
run. Clearly, there are indications that Japan's own baby boomers - softened
by years of plenty, western standards and materialism - will be less
inclined to keep up appearances.
Elsewhere, the ferro-vanadium producers have cut back capacity to about
3,000 tonnes a year, with the resulting 1,000 tonnes annual supply deficit
made up by cheap imports.
According to Nissho Iwai official Mr Shoji Uematsu, whose trade house acts
as an intermediary for the producers and also sells cheap Czech
ferro-vanadium to south-east Asia in direct competition: 'The Japanese
converters are not competitive enough. The time will come when some part of
the industry will need to be replaced by imports'.
At the moment the Japanese are still maintaining the tradition of quality,
refusing to use lower grade Russian imports. But the Japanese are monitoring
the material, with small amounts of Russian imports for testing showing up
on the statistics sheets.
The Japanese are also monitoring investment possibilities in the former
Soviet Union. A large delegation of Japanese government and private-sector
representatives recently embarked on a two-week mission to the central Asian
states of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to survey non-ferrous mines and refining
operations.
On a smaller scale, Tokyo-based trade house Tomen is sending a delegation to
Moscow to look at possibilities, while Nissho Iwai is faring better than
most from its shrewd marketing arrangement with the Czech ferro-alloys
producer Mnisek.
On the domestic front much hangs on the government's spending initiatives,
which injected Y10,700bn (Pounds 64bn) last year and are set to stump up a
further Yl3,000bn this year.
But business confidence has taken a severe battering and no one is
predicting a vigorous economic recovery.
Mr Kunio Ino, manager of the purchasing department of Furukawa Electric,
which produces aluminium sheet and extrusions, revealed that his company's
sheet production for the can industry had been cut from 20,000 to 17,000
tonnes a month. He believes that over-investment is responsible for poor
results in the Japanese aluminium industry, which has poured money back into
new projects and expansion to keep pace with sustained growth of 10 per cent
a year.
'Fortunately, we did not have enough money to invest abroad,' he said,
adding: 'Recovery (nationally) is possible next year, but the pace will be
very slow. The (aluminium) industry invested too much over the past five
years. Next year will see much lower investment, with investment decreasing
by 5 to 10 per cent per year over the next two or three years.'
Mr Yoshihiro Shito, managing director and general manager of the non-ferrous
metals division of Tomen, agreed that over-investment had added to the
burden of high overheads, producing tiny profits compared with turnover. For
example, the big five steel companies recently reported turnover down 'only
7 to 10 per cent with profits slashed by 60 to 100 per cent'.
Suggesting that the Japanese will do anything to save face he added: 'The
Japanese economy cannot be sunk. (Some companies) have sold assets to offset
losses, to make a round figure . . . Japan is standing on a turning point,
it is looking to the US for leadership.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: CS First Boston completes
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston, the New York-based global investment bank, confirmed it had
completed a year-long process of integrating the management of its main
business lines into product, rather than geographic, groupings.
The moves are regarded by industry analysts as an attempt by the bank to
improve co-ordination between the operations.
Under the new system, Mr Archibald Cox, chief executive of the bank's US
operations, will be responsible for CSFB's equities business; Mr Allen Wheat
and Mr Robert Diamond, two senior executives, will take charge of the fixed
income business; and Mr Cox and Mr David Mulford, chief executive of the
bank's European unit, will be responsible for investment banking.
The task of managing CSFB's administrative, information systems and finance
operations has been handed to Mr Ruedi Stalder, chief financial officer.
The management of CSFB was organised around three separate regional units of
the bank - the US-based First Boston, the London-based Credit Suisse First
Boston, and the Tokyo-based CS First Boston Pacific.
The integration of the main businesses under product lines follows the
welding of the bank's foreign exchange and derivatives operations into
globally-oriented units.
Poor relations among the different units of CSFB are believed to have
contributed to the bank's relatively poor recent performance. In 1992, at a
time when most Wall Street investment banks and securities houses were
posting record profits, CSFB reported a 19 per cent decline in net income to
Dollars 175m.
A spokesman for CSFB, which has been hit recently by a series of staff
defections amid grumblings over year-end bonuses, denied that the changes
represented a significant restructuring of the bank.
He said: 'It's not a reorganisation of the firm. It's a global integration
of our major business lines.'
Although the global integration of CSFB's businesses has not involved a
name-change for the organisation, sources at the bank revealed that
management had been discussing combining all the different units under one
name.

healthcare stake
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American pharmaceuticals group, is investing
Dollars 113m to acquire about 37 per cent of Applied Immune Sciences, a
Californian-based healthcare company that is a leader in immunology.
The Franco-American group also has the right to acquire 6m AIS shares before
the end of June 1997, increasing its stake to about 60 per cent.
The two groups plan to collaborate on research and development in gene and
cell therapies.
They also intend to create a 50-50 joint-venture to market and distribute
cell therapy products and services. The venture will be established
immediately in Europe and be expanded worldwide.
The deal gives RPR access to cell therapy, a way of isolating cells from a
patient's body, removing them, numerically expanding them, and then putting
them back into the patient. It avoids the side-effects associated with
traditional drugs.
It will be providing Dollars 30m to help fund a network of worldwide centres
using AIS's technology.
The investment follows RPR's recent research agreements with the French
Centre National de Recherche Scientifique and the Institut Gustave Roussy.
'Yesterday's move is a significant step by RPR's more aggressive and focused
management,' said Mr Viren Mehta, analyst at New York-based pharmaceuticals
specialists Mehta and Isaly.

<TEXT>
THOMSON Corporation, the international travel and publishing group, is
entering the real estate business by taking over a loss-making US
residential developer from another company controlled by Canada's Thomson
family.
Thomson insisted yesterday that the deal made sound business sense, noting
it had been approved by a committee of independent directors.
The company said the acquisition was 'neither material nor significant' to
its overall business and it would continue to concentrate on its publishing
and travel interests.
Thomson will pay up to USDollars 145m for Markborough Communities (MC), the
US community land division of Markborough Properties, which is 83 per cent
owned by the Thomson family.
Of the total, Dollars 30m will be paid immediately in cash, with the rest
coming from cash flows generated by MC's properties over the next five
years.
Thomson will first be entitled to recover its initial Dollars 30m investment
from cash flows.
MC is developing residential communities on 7,900 acres of land in Florida,
Texas, Colorado and Arizona.
Markborough Properties yesterday completed the transfer of the community
land division to Woodbridge, a Thomson holding company, after taking a
CDollars 521m (US410m) writedown on the properties earlier this year.
Woodbridge has further supported Markborough by taking up its full
entitlement to the developer's CDollars 250m rights issue earlier this year.
Mr Nigel Harrison, Thomson's chief financial officer, said yesterday that,
unlike Woodbridge, Thomson has the operating capacity to manage the
developments.
It also has growing US taxable income to take advantage of tax losses
incurred by MC. 'We would not do this unless it made business sense,' he
said.
Curragh, the Canadian zinc producer, has won more time to complete its
restructuring and emerge from bankruptcy protection. It owes creditors
CDollars 221m.
The company has a two-month extension to August 31 to win court approval for
its restructuring. A CDollars 50m equity infusion from Korea Zinc and
Samsung, also of Korea, is conditional on Curragh raising another CDollars
25m in equity.

   AACHEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs, the German insurance group, reports a
slight dip in net profits for 1992 but says earnings for this year should be
broadly maintained, Reuter reports from Aachen.
The company made a net profit of DM73.2m (Dollars 45.8m) last year, against
DM74.1m in 1991. It is paying an unchanged DM12.50 a share dividend for 1992
and plans to hold this rate of payout in the current year.
Mr Wolfgang Kaske, chief executive, told the annual press conference that
1993 would be a year of consolidation, adding AMB was well-equipped to deal
with the currently difficult trading conditions.
Last year had been a year of change, marked by the turbulent addition of
French state-owned insurer Assurances Generales des France (AGF) to AMB's
list of shareholders and the sale of a large stake in its BfG Bank.
Following the recent sale of a 21 per cent stake in AMB by Italian insurer
La Fondiaria to a number of German banks and insurers, the AMB group would
have a solid shareholder structure, Mr Kaske said.
He said AGF and AMB would be looking to expand their co-operation in the
area of home finance. AMB was currently trying to export the German concept
of 'save-and-build' to France by means of AGF's distribution network, Mr
Kaske added.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort in Pounds 85m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson is raising Pounds 85m of fixed rate debentures for four of
the investment trusts within its stable.
A specially created vehicle, Fintrust Debenture, is raising the money in an
effort to benefit from the lower costs involved in a larger issue.
The debentures will have a 30-year life and will bear an interest rate of
9.25 per cent per annum. The gross redemption yield will be fixed at a
margin of 65 basis points (0.65 of a percentage point) over the yield of the
Treasury 8.75 per cent 2017 stock.
The four trusts involved are Kleinwort Overseas (raising Pounds 25m),
Brunner (Pounds 15m), Kleinwort Charter (Pounds 15m) and Merchants (Pounds
30m).
Investment trusts are allowed to borrow money (or gear up) with the aim of
earning a higher return on their portfolios than they pay on the debt. The
new debt will leave Brunner, Kleinwort Charter and Merchants with 20 per
cent gearing, while the figure for Kleinwort Overseas will be 122.5 per
cent.
Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, said:
'We believe that the current level of interest rates - which is close to
25-year lows - presents an excellent opportunity to raise long-term finance
on attractive terms.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Dunloe plans move into fruit
distribution

<TEXT>
DUNLOE HOUSE, the Dublin-based property group recently taken over by Mr Ben
Dunne, the Irish supermarket magnate, is planning to expand into the
wholesale fruit distribution business in a direct challenge to Fyffes in its
Irish back yard.
According to Mr Michael Cosgrove, Dunloe's new managing director, no final
decision has yet been taken. However, he said that a distribution operation
could be set up 'within a couple of months'.
Mr Dunne bought a 75 per cent stake in the loss-making Dunloe group last
March, following his ousting as the chief executive of the family-run Dunnes
Stores business, the largest retailing business in Ireland.
Mr Dunne has retained his position as director of food purchasing within the
Dunnes Stores group, although his future with the company is seen by some
market analysts as being precarious. Mr Dunne yesterday admitted that there
were tensions at board level, saying: 'They are professional business
disagreements. But there is always a way out of them and at the end of the
day blood is thicker than water.'
Dunnes Stores is an important customer of Fyffes in Ireland. According to
one Dublin analyst it generates around 4 per cent of Fyffes' total profits.
It is thought that a former senior manager at Fyffes, Mr Dennis McCoy, is in
negotiations with Dunloe to set up its fruit distribution operation although
Mr Cosgrove would neither confirm nor deny this.
Fyffes recently won a temporary High Court injunction against Mr McCoy and
two other former employees of Fyffes preventing them from setting up their
own fruit distribution business in Ireland due to their inside knowledge of
Fyffes' operations. The injunction is due to expire in the next few months.
Mr Carl McCann, Fyffes finance director, said last night: 'This has always
been a highly competitive business with tight margins. We have always
respected competition, both new and existing.'

THE Swedish government and Volvo, the car and truck maker, yesterday
resolved an 18-month dispute over the future of Procordia, the food and
drugs group, by agreeing to split the company in two with Volvo taking over
the food and consumer products side of the business.
In a share swap deal, to be completed in the autumn, the government will
become the majority shareholder in Procordia's pharmaceutical and
biotechnology businesses, including 51 per cent of Erbamont, an Italian
drugs company acquired in May from Italy's Montedison. Volvo, Sweden's
biggest industrial group, will take a 74 per cent share in the demerged
non-drug Procordia units, and seek to buy the remaining 26 per cent held
publicly.
It will retain a 25 per cent stake in Procordia's pharmaceutical operation,
with the option to increase its holding to 35 per cent as the government
sells its stake over the next 18 months.
Volvo holds 39.5 per cent of Procordia's equity and 42.8 per cent of its
voting rights, while the state holds 34.2 per cent of the capital and 42.7
per cent of the votes.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Hartstone issues further warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTSTONE, the hosiery and leather goods group, yesterday issued its second
profits warning in a week and said it had suspended a senior employee who
had gained personally from corporate foreign exchange dealings.
The announcement came after the stock market closed with its shares up 3p at
41p. They had crashed from 91p to 34p last Friday after the company said its
pre-tax profits for the year ended March, 1993, would not be less than
Pounds 9m after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs.
Shareholders were also surprised last week that Mr Stephen Barker, its
chairman and chief executive, was stepping down after an all-night meeting
between the company and its advisers.
His active acquisition strategy had turned the company into the third
largest European hosiery group.
Hartstone said yesterday its pre-tax profits were likely to be reduced by a
further Pounds 260,000 after arrangements came to light involving payments
over four years totalling Pounds 1m to employees of a subsidiary company.
It declined to give further details.
The company also revealed that a senior employee, now suspended, had
arranged for certain funds derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract
to be paid to an account for his benefit.
An advance of Pounds 50,000 to that employee may also be irrecoverable, it
added.
The board still expects that a standstill agreement with its banks will be
entered into shortly. It recently said it had breached at least one banking
covenant calling for 2.5 times interest cover.
Interest charges at the half-way stage had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds
3.3m.
Hartstone also explained for the first time why it had increased provisions
last Friday to Pounds 12m from Pounds 8.5m flagged in a profits warning in
March.
An additional Pounds 2.1m related to the repositioning of the hosiery
division, particularly from losses incurred in UK rationalisation, and
Pounds 1.4m of abortive acquisition costs had been written off.
In addition, it had paid earlier this week the remaining consideration of
about Pounds 5.2m for Aznar International, the Spanish hosiery business it
had acquired.
Discussions continue with Charterhouse Group International on the settlement
of Dollars 12.8m (Pounds 8.3m) for Etienne Aigner and Michael Stevens, the
leathergoods groups based in the US it had bought.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Transatlantic takes stake in Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the financial services group owned jointly by French
and South African interests, yesterday announced the acquisition of a
'strategic' stake in Sun Alliance, one of the UK's biggest insurance groups.
Transatlantic, which already owns 50 per cent of Sun Life, the life insurer,
bought 400,000 shares on Wednesday, increasing its stake to more than 3 per
cent and making it one of Sun Alliance's largest shareholders. Stock
exchange rules make disclosure of stakes of more than 3 per cent obligatory.
Mr Donald Gordon, the South African entrepreneur who is chairman of of
Transatlantic, said: 'We see this as a strategic investment in embryo. We
will obviously give it more attention than before.'
Mr Gordon compared the investment with more than a dozen built up by Liberty
Life, the South African life insurance group, which owns 50 per cent of
Transatlantic. 'We've often done that. These stakes are selected very
carefully after much thought and attention.'
He said that Transatlantic's involvement in Sun Life had begun in a similar
way in the mid-1980s.
Observers predicted that Mr Gordon would soon move to increase his stake.
'If I was Sun Alliance I'd feel nervous now. Donald Gordon takes a long term
view,' said one merchant banker.
Union des Assurance de Paris, the French state-controlled insurer, which
owns 50 per cent of Transatlantic, is also thought to be keen to expand into
the UK general insurance market.
In spite of suffering heavy losses in recent years, Sun Alliance had an 'the
highest solvency ratio, an excellent portfolio and a lot of potential,' said
Mr Gordon.
The group was well placed to benefit both from recent rises in insurance
rates and from the appointnment last month of Sir Christopher Benson as its
new chairman.
Like Mr Gordon, Sir Christopher, formerly chairman of MEPC, shares a
background in the property sector. 'I have great confidence in Sir
Christopher. I know him well,' said Mr Gordon.
He was sure that Sun Alliance had 'taken precautions' which would avoid the
kind of losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business which have dogged
the group in recent years.
A legal dispute between Capital &amp; Counties, the property company owned by
Transatlantic, with Sun Alliance over the Harlequin shopping centre
development in Watford had not influenced the decision to increase the
stake, added Mr Gordon.
Sun Alliance and Capital &amp; Counties developed the complex together but
argued over the way in which net property income from the project was to be
shared. Transatlantic took legal action last year.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Italtel chief arrested by Milan police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S state-owned telecommunications group, Stet, yesterday slid further
into the widening political corruption scandal with the decision by Mr
Salvatore Randi, managing director of its Italtel manufacturing subsidiary,
to surrender to Milan police.
Italtel, in which AT&amp;T of the US has a 20 per cent stake, is the country's
leading producer of telephones and exchanges.
Mr Randi's move followed the issue of a warrant for his arrest by
magistrates investigating corruption allegations relating to contracts from
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
The detention of Mr Randi follows last month's arrest of Mr Luigi Montella,
managing director of Stet's Sirti network engineering subsidiary. Mr
Montella and other officials of Stet subsidiaries were arrested following
allegations by Mr Davide Giacalone, an adviser to Mr Oscar Mammi, a former
posts minister.
Mr Giacalone's testimony, widely leaked, has given magistrates in Milan and
Rome a string of new leads. These include contracts by the former state ASST
telecommunications agency and the allocation of valuable television
broadcasting frequencies by the posts ministry under Mr Mammi.
Mr Randi allegedly paid L3.8bn to Mr Giuseppe Parrella, ASST's director
general, detained by magistrates last month. The arrest of Mr Parrella, in
connection with alleged kickbacks of about L40bn on ASST contracts worth
L2,500bn between 1987-91, was followed by that of Mr Giuseppe Lo Moro, a
former assistant to Mr Parrella, now believed to have incriminated Mr Randi.
Separately, Mr Randi is believed to have contacted Milan magistrates
independently before his arrest with written testimony regarding ASST
contracts. Recent arrests, which include the heads of the Italian
subsidiaries of the multinational Siemens and Ericsson telecommunications
groups, suggest magistrates are investigating whether bidding procedures on
ASST contracts may have been rigged by leading suppliers.
Addressing Stet's annual shareholders' meeting in Turin yesterday, Mr Biagio
Agnes, chairman, said: 'As far as Stet is concerned, I confirm that
contributions have never been given to political parties or their
appendages.' However, seeking to distance the group, which is widely
followed by foreign investors, from its subsidiaries, he added: 'For the
group's subsidiaries, which are administratively and managerially
independent, we were never aware of irregular situations and we never
received such signs even in these last turbulent months.'
Mr Agnes said the arrests of senior executives had prompted him to
commission an audit of the group and its subsidiaries. He gave no indication
of when the results would be known but said he retained full confidence in
the group's management 'until the opposite is proven'.
The Stet group comprises six of the seven state-controlled companies which
run Italy's telecommunications and part of the equipment-making business.

the German car maker's action to stem losses
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE supervisory board of Volkswagen yesterday pledged its 'unconditional
confidence' in Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its new production and
purchasing director, and denounced the campaign by General Motors, his
former employer, to 'discredit' him.
'The supervisory board emphatically rejects the accusation that Mr Lopez and
seven colleagues broke their obligations of secrecy to their former
employers at Opel and General Motors,' Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the
board, told the annual shareholders' meeting.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive, said that the way in which GM had
attempted 'to discredit not only the blameless reputation of Mr Lopez and
his colleagues, but also the image of the whole VW concern was
incomprehensible'.
He revealed that the seven former GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to VW
had started legal action against the US motor manufacturer. They were
demanding that GM refrain from any action affecting their working
relationship with VW and that it retract its allegations. That action was
supported by both VW and Mr Lopez.
Mr Liesen, responding to rumours that Mr Lopez is earning more than Dollars
5m a year, said his salary amounted to 'less than one third of this sum'.
He said Mr Lopez was 'of high intelligence and unusually great creativity,
who shows ways in which the European automobile industry can survive
competition with Japanese and other producers. This is an ambition of
historic importance.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: KLM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch carrier's annual results come as a stark reminder of the sickly
state of the international airline industry. Despite useful progress in
trimming costs and winning market share, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines dived into
a Fl 562m loss. As British Airways' latest traffic figures confirm,
passengers retain an annoying preference for the cheaper seats at the back
of the cabin, wrecking airlines' profitability.
With 350 per cent gearing and sharply declining aircraft yields, KLM is
under considerable financial pressure. This must only add to the impetus to
consummate its proposed integration with SAS, Swissair and Austrian
Airlines. The rationalisation of corporate overheads and airport facilities
would quickly release working capital. Fleet harmonisation and the disposal
of holdings in other associated airlines would yield longer-term financial
benefits. KLM may do especially well out of a merger if, as seems probable,
its Amsterdam hub provided the combined airline's operational centre.
Yet the complexities remain awesome. With six national governments, four
corporate managements, and several sensitive trade unions involved, the
discussions may well drag through the summer. Any hitches would further
undermine KLM's faltering share price. But they would come as a welcome
relief to Air France as it begins to roll down the privatisation runway.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Burundi's Tutsi elite feel the winds of democracy: Michael
Holman on changes in a country which once murdered its citizens at the rate
of 1,000 a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICA'S longest dominating ethnic minority is bowing to the winds of
change.
Nearly 500 years after establishing their hegemony, and 30-odd years after
Harold Macmillan warned white South Africa that the days of apartheid were
numbered, Burundi's Tutsi elite seem set to surrender power to the country's
Hutu majority.
On Wednesday the first democratic elections in the central African nation's
history marked a watershed in a country scarred by tribal genocide.
Mr Melchior Ndadaye, a 40-year old banker and leader of the Burundi
Democracy Front, won 60 per cent of the vote to defeat Major Pierre Buyoya,
the military president, The presidential poll is to be followed by
legislative elections on June 29, ending a two-year transition to democratic
rule.
'Mr Ndadaye needs to win both (elections) to have real control of the
country,' cautioned one western election monitor quoted by Reuters in
Bujumbura, but the Tutsi's ancient hold on the country appears to have been
broken.
Major Buyoya, a former army officer who came to power in a bloodless coup in
1987, has presided over a transition as difficult as any in Africa,
overcoming a bloody history.
Poor, remote, heavily dependent on coffee exports, and of little strategic
interest to the superpowers, Burundi has been able to keep out of the
spotlight directed on southern African minority regimes.
The Tutsi minority, an unusually tall race making up 14 per cent of the 5.6m
population, have dominated the Hutu majority (85 per cent) since the 16th
century. The colonial era saw little change in a near feudal relationship.
In 1899, along with neighbouring Rwanda, Burundi became part of German East
Africa. After the first world war German rule was replaced by a Belgian
mandate which ended with independence in 1962.
The Tutsi hold on power was reinforced by discrimination in the education
system, civil service and army. A Hutu-led coup attempt in 1965 was
ruthlessly suppressed, with many leading members of the Hutu tribe losing
their lives. Worse was to come.
In April 1972 began one of the worst slaughters the continent has known.
What started the bloodshed is unclear. Michel Micombero, a young Tutsi army
officer who seized power in a coup in 1966, claimed to have discovered a
Hutu plot aimed at exterminating Tutsi.
Whatever the cause, what transpired amounted to 'the systematic killing of
as many as a quarter of a million people . . . over a four-month period men,
women and children were savagely murdered at a rate of more than a thousand
a day,' concluded an investigation funded by the Washington-based Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
By mid-May, the US embassy in Bujumbura 'started getting disturbing reports
that the government was not just mopping up the rebels but trying to punish
the whole Hutu tribe', the report recounted, drawing on embassy material:
'They tried to skim off the cream of the Hutu tribe, to kill every possible
Hutu male of distinction over the age of 14.'
The four Hutu members of cabinet, nearly all officers and soldiers in armed
forces, half the primary school teachers, bank clerks, businessmen and civil
servants perished in a selective slaughter.
The genocide that followed was largely ignored outside the country. The UN
helped to assist the 150,000 refugees who sought refuge in neighbouring
states, but otherwise stood aside.
The Organisation for African Unity characteristically declined to act.
During a June summit, the council of ministers sent a formal note to Mr
Micombero: 'Thanks to your saving action, peace will be rapidly
re-established, national unity will be consolidated and territorial
integrity will be preserved.'
International concern was ineffectual and short-lived, and Burundi returned
to obscurity. Micombero was replaced in a bloodless coup by his cousin, Col
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in 1976, himself deposed by Major Buyoya.
His first act of reconciliation was to share cabinet posts between the two
tribes, giving Hutu their first real voice in government in 20 years and
naming the first Hutu premier since 1965. But a further bout of ethnic
slaughter in 1988 killed at least 5,000 people, giving renewed urgency to
reform. Like the minority leaders in southern Africa, Burundi's president
had set in train a process of change he can no longer control.

SOUTH AFRICA would go to the polls on April 27 next year in its first
all-race elections under a proposal put forward last night by a multi-party
planning committee in the country's democracy negotiations.
The 10-member committee presented a draft resolution proposing the date to a
104-member negotiating council which will debate the issue. Under the
resolution, the council would recommend this date to the higher level
negotiating forum due to meet on June 25.
'We believe (setting a date) is vital to inject confidence into the
negotiation process,' the resolution said. 'It will send a ray of optimism
and hope through the country.'
Such a date is likely to be merely a target, however. It would be
conditional on agreement in the multi-party talks on an interim
constitution. But it will have a psychological impact in a country desperate
for signs of a political solution with a promise of stability.
It does not seem likely that a date on its own, however, would trigger the
lifting of international economic sanctions. This would require agreement on
an interim executive council to oversee government in the run-up to
elections.
Mr Joe Slovo, South African Communist party leader mandated by the ANC and
its allies to introduce the election date resolution, earlier accused some
of the negotiating groups of delaying tactics.
'There is a lot of filibustering, there is too much filibustering going on,
some of it deliberate to stall the process.' A government delegate also
expressed anger at slow proceedings. But other parties were more cautious.
'Unless we move on the question of the form of the (future) state, violence
and constitutional principles, there's no point in setting an election
date,' a delegate from the conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party
said.
Progress was made on Tuesday when Inkatha appeared to accept that a final
constitution should be written by an elected constituent assembly. However,
this later seemed in jeopardy after the party said its central committee had
rejected this concession.
Both Mr Slovo and Mr Benny Alexander, general secretary of the radical black
Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), condemned the presence outside the conference
building of about 150 uniformed white ultra-rightists of the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement (AWB), some heavily armed.
The PAC and the government adjourned another bilateral session yesterday
over a police swoop on PAC members last week and the PAC's refusal to
renounce armed struggle. There was no indication of any agreement between
the two sides.

THE Uzbekistan government has doubled wages and prices and issued a law
halting trade in securities.
The changes enacted on Tuesday are part of continuing efforts to stave off
economic chaos but still leave Uzbekistan with lower basic prices than its
neighbours, a point the government has stressed to prevent public
opposition. There has been no noticeable public reaction to the rises
despite a doubling of bread prices to Rbs16 and a more than twofold increase
of petrol prices to Rbs100 a litre from Rbs40.
Fees were also doubled for water, public transport and sewage services.
The apparent public acceptance was probably attributable to the simultaneous
doubling of state salaries.
The moves by the nation of 21m people, the most populous in central Asia,
are the latest in its efforts to retain social and political stability. Mr
Islam Karimov, Uzbek president, has made it clear he is not retreating from
his economic and political policies, despite complaints from western
governments which have withheld loans and other assistance.
This week the government continued its closed-door trial of Mr Shukrullo
Mirsaidov, former mayor of the capital of Tashkent, and rival of Mr Karimov.
Mr Mirsaidov faces charges of 'misusing state resources'.
The trial, the latest in a series of cases against Mr Karimov's opponent,
appeared to be a signal that the president is unwilling to tolerate even his
conservative rivals.
Meanwhile a confusing new securities law, published on May 25 in the local
newspaper Pravda Vostoka appears to outlaw the trading of shares and bank
deposit certificates. The law, a sub-clause in a new criminal code, banning
'speculation in securities' had halted business at a twice-monthly trading
session.

THE United Nations yesterday launched a Dollars 226m appeal for humanitarian
aid for Angola, where 'on a conservative estimate' 1,000 people a day are
dying from famine and malnutrition as a result of the upsurge in fighting.
Miss Margaret Anstee, UN special envoy for Angola, who presented the appeal
in Geneva, said afterwards that donor nations had pledged an estimated
Dollars 70m in immediate response, and more had been promised.
Describing Angola as a 'forgotten tragedy', the appeal document said renewed
civil strife had 'caused thousands of deaths, injuries, massive internal
displacement, destitution of over 2m Angolans, material deprivation,
psychological trauma and the collapse of social and economic systems'.
Miss Anstee said that, in the absence of a ceasefire between government
forces and Unita rebels, the UN was proposing an emergency plan for one
month as part of the year-long aid programme.
She dismissed claims by Unita that the UN was biased in choosing where to
deliver aid, but admitted Unita-held areas were less secure for aid workers.
Unita now controlled an estimated 75-80 per cent of Angolan territory, she
said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Saudis in row over pilgrimage

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI Arabia, Iran and Libya continued to trade insults yesterday over the
conduct of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca which historically has brought to
the surface political tensions among the Moslem nations of the Middle East.
Iran again this year attempted to defy the Saudi authorities by using the
Haj to stage demonstrations denouncing the US and Israel. Saudi Arabia
yesterday hit back at Iranian reports of a mass demonstration outside Mecca,
describing it as an attempt by extremists to undermine relations between the
two countries.
Television in Iran had shown hundreds of pilgrims chanting anti-American
slogans and claimed that Saudi riot police had surrounded the demonstrators.
Libya also kept up its denunciation of Saudi Arabia for refusing to allow
its aircraft to fly pilgrims to Mecca, an action taken to comply with UN
sanctions imposed as a result of Libya's alleged involvement in the
destruction of a Pan-Am airliner over Scotland.
In a bizarre twist at the weekend, Libya sent nearly 200 pilgrims to visit
religious sites in Jerusalem.

THE international treaty to combat global warming, agreed a year ago at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, could come into force as early as mid-1994,
United Nations officials said yesterday.
The treaty, signed by 162 nations, has already secured 21 ratifications out
of the 50 required to bring it into effect. They include the US, Japan and
China, among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases that are warming the earth's atmosphere.
Climate model forecasts suggest the earth's average surface temperature will
increase by between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade over the next 100 years,
which could cause disruption to farming, desertification, a higher risk of
floods and storms, and a rise in the sea level from melting icecaps.
The treaty aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries
at 1990 levels by the year 2000, which would slow but not prevent further
temperature rises. Treaty commitments will be reviewed as new evidence comes
in.
Mr Michael Zammit Cutajar, executive secretary of the treaty's interim
secretariat in Geneva, said yesterday that donor countries had indicated a
willingness to put up an additional SDR2bn-SDR3bn (Dollars 2.9bn-Dollars
4.3bn) for 1994-96 to help developing nations implement the convention.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Special EC summit idea takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IDEA of a special autumn EC summit to discuss implementing the
Maastricht treaty received the backing yesterday of Mr Hans van den Broek,
European commissioner for external political relations.
Speaking in London, he said such a meeting would provide 'new and credible
impulses for carrying out and bringing forward the integration process'.
The proposal was made on Wednesday by six Christian Democrat leaders, headed
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The idea of calling a special summit to mark the
ratification of the Maastricht treaty fits in with the German chancellor's
desire to revive popular enthusiasm for the Community and give it 'a special
push ahead'.
One idea which could be explored is the possibility of bringing Austria,
Finland, Norway and Sweden into the Community before the end of 1995, as
currently planned.
A second theme would be to offer a better deal to eastern Europe countries
whose full EC membership is a much more distant prospect.
Yesterday, Mr van den Broek said he was optimistic that the regular
six-monthly EC summit to be held in Copenhagen later this month would
endorse Commission proposals for further liberalisation of trade with
central and eastern Europe.
The measures are due to be discussed by EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg
on Tuesday.
As for the suggested special summit, there is some doubt in Bonn whether it
should try to settle the thorny problem of siting new EC institutions, in
particular the European Monetary Institute. It would require tough
negotiations, particularly between Germany, which wants the EMI in
Frankfurt, and Britain, which would prefer any other site.
Such haggling would be out of keeping with an optimistic, smiling summit,
which is clearly what Mr Kohl wants.
Just when a summit could be called depends not only on the British
parliament, but also on the German constitutional court, which is
considering a series of legal challenges to ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
The court is expected to hold its oral hearing into the complaints by the
end of June. Mr Kohl hopes that a final decision will come before the summer
recess, but other officials are more cautious, suggesting that it may not be
ready until mid-September, or even early October.
That would still allow the special summit to be held by the end of October.
The incoming Belgian presidency of the EC yesterday declared its
determination to set up the European Monetary Institute on schedule by
January 1, 1994 - the start of the second stage of European monetary union,
Lionel Barber adds from Brussels.
In a speech in Brussels, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister,
called upon EC member states to make the process toward Emu irreversible.
Failure to do so would encourage currency speculators, he said.
Federalist-minded Belgium takes over the presidency from Denmark on July 1.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nissan invests in Chinese truck
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese vehicle maker, is to set up a mini-truck plant in
Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan province - the company's first
direct investment in the fast-growing China auto market.
Nissan has signed a contract with Zhengzhou Light Truck Factory to produce
30,000 one-ton pick-up trucks by 1997. The project includes an auto chair
workshop and a brake system manufacturing plant.
'What had prevented us from coming earlier,' said Mr Shigeno, Nissan's
Beijing manager, 'was the limited market size in China and its different
economic system. Compared to the Europeans and the Americans, we were
inexperienced in dealing with communist countries such as China.'
The first trucks are planned to roll off the assembly line in early 1994.
Nissan's investment in China contrasts with European, American and some
minor Japanese auto makers. Volkswagen of Germany, Peugeot and Citroen of
France, Chrysler and General Motors of the US have all set up car, mini-bus
or truck assembly plants in China. Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki have licenced
mini-cars to plants in Tianjin and Chongqing.
'This year, things are different: American and European markets are
saturated, Japan's domestic market slumped. But China's demand keeps
growing. This is what drew us here,' said Mr Shigeno.
Nissan's biggest concern is over China's market size. 'You need a market
that could consume 3m units to make a profit, or it's not worth it,' said Mr
Shigeno.
Last year, China produced 1.08m motor vehicles including 250,000 cars,
100,000 more than the previous year. China imports 100,000 cars a year.
China's gross national product growth rate exceeded 12 per cent last year
and in the first quarter this year it topped 14 per cent.
China is Asia's second largest auto market after Japan.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the larger US stores groups yesterday reported modest improvements
in same-store sales growth during May.
In the previous month, they generally experienced weak sales performances,
partly related to the poor weather and partly to renewed doubts about the
health of the US economy.
Kmart, the large discount and speciality store group, said that sales in May
improved 'considerably', for example.
It attributed this to 'more seasonable spring weather in many parts of the
country', and added there had been a 'very strong pick-up in sales in the
first week of the June reporting period'.
However, despite the upturn, Kmart's total same-store sales rose by a modest
1.1 per cent in May, including a 2.6 per cent increase on the general
merchandise side.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, reported that same-store
sales advanced by 6 per cent in May - slightly above the 4 per cent rise now
seen for the first four months of the year.
Its Sam's warehouse clubs reported flat like-for-like sales for the month,
against a 2 per cent decline in the first four months of the financial year.
Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based retailer, fared slightly better - posting
a 5.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in its core domestic stores
division.
'Almost all merchandise lines reported increases,' said Mr Arthur Martinez,
chairman of the merchandise division, adding that the strongest increases
came in clothing, lawn and garden lines and certain appliances.
Among the department stores, however, JC Penney saw an increase of just 1.9
per cent in the mainline stores; at Federated, there was a 2.6 per cent
advance; in the main division of May Department Stores, a 4.2 per cent rise.
Woolworth, which has reported lack-lustre figures recently, posted a 3.8 per
cent increase on a same-store basis.
Meanwhile, among the specialty stores, The Gap, the fashion chain which
weathered much of the recession in better shape than rival retailers but has
lost ground recently, reported only a 3 per cent increase in same-store
sales. Its shares fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 1/4 .
Sears, Roebuck is ahead of schedule in its plan to reduce debt by more than
Dollars 3bn, said vice chairman Mr James Denny, Reuter reports from Chicago.
Last autumn, Sears unveiled a restructuring plan to spin off its financial
services network and reduce debt by more than Dollars 3bn.
The retailer sold 20 per cent of Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co this winter in
an initial public offering, and proceeds were about Dollars 865m.
The Allstate offering raised Dollars 2.12bn before any exercise by
underwriters of overallotment options to buy up to an additional 11m shares.
Sears also has entered an agreement for PNC Bank to buy Sears Mortgage
Banking Group for Dollars 328m.
'I can tell you we are pleased with the values we have received,' Mr Denny.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Headline turns the page for Hodder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTHORS such as television personality Cilla Black and champion jockey Peter
Scudamore are teaming up with Winston Churchill, John Buchan and John le
Carre.
Such diverse talent is being brought under one roof in a Pounds 48.9m
takeover by seven-year-old upstart Headline Book Publishing of the stately
125-year-old Hodder &amp; Stoughton.
The recommended offer is likely to create in Hodder Headline the second
largest independent UK publisher after Macmillan. It will be worth close to
Pounds 100m.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, the 39-year-old founder of Headline, said yesterday
that substantial savings would flow from the deal. Hodder Headline would
also have greatly increased resources to move aggressively in the
marketplace.
'If it makes sense to offer an author a Pounds 3m multi-book deal we will do
it,' said Mr Hely Hutchinson, who will be group chief executive.
Headline, a specialist in popular commercial publishing, has 76.8 per cent
acceptances for the privately held Hodder shares. Most of the 120
shareholders are descended from founders of the company, set up as an
evangelical publisher. Hodder shareholders are being offered 37.5 new
Headline shares for each of theirs. The paper offer is worth Pounds 108.75 a
share, the partial cash version Pounds 90. Headline is also raising Pounds
12.8m in a four-for-nine rights issue at 240p a share.
The merged group will move into new central London headquarters but the two
sales forces will remain separate. Hodder's wide range of publishing - from
general fiction and non-fiction to children's books and religion - will be
retained.
Although both companies are trading profitably, exceptional merger costs
might lead to a pre-tax loss this year.
Apart from stepping up in size, Headline is getting access to a profitable
backlist of more than 5,000 titles. And the venerable Hodder is also way
ahead of Headline in 'non-book' products, ranging from audio and video tapes
to CD-Roms.
Hodder is about to launch Worshipmaster, a product that could revolutionise
the lives of Church of England vicars. The computer programme will produce
suitable texts, readings and hymns for specific Sundays of the year.
Mr Philip Attenborough and Mr Patrick Wright, who have run Hodder, will
become deputy chairman and deputy chief executive respectively of Hodder
Headline.

Could Tim Hely Hutchinson, founder of Headline Books, be the new Paul Hamlyn
of British publishing? Having just agreed a Pounds 49m takeover of the
125-year-old publishers Hodder &amp; Stoughton, he was refreshingly modest when
Observer popped the question yesterday.
He stresses that he is not nearly as innovative as the fabulously wealthy
Hamlyn, founder of Octopus Books and creator of a whole new consumer
publishing sector. 'I'm only a manager,' says Hely Hutchinson, whose father,
the Earl of Donoughmore, will be non-executive chairman of the enlarged
group.
Whereas Hamlyn is reckoned to be worth Pounds 180m, Hely Hutchinson only
owns 3 per cent of Headline, which just about makes him a millionaire. But
he is almost as young as Hamlyn was when he sold his first business to Cecil
King's IPC in 1964 and thereby coined his initial million.
Given that he is nearly 30 years younger than 67-year-old Hamlyn, and
probably running the second largest independent publisher after Macmillan,
young Tim is not doing too badly.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (7): Some effective cards to play -
Tourism / Improving quality of life is an attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MID GLAMORGAN is succeeding in attracting people not just as workers in the
new industries that are replacing the coal mines, but as tourists.
The county, the most industrial in south Wales and in parts the most
deprived, may seem an unlikely magnet for tourists, but there is a potential
that is being increasingly exploited.
Mr Paul Loveluck, chief executive of the Wales Tourist Board, which has
played a big part in promoting new attractions, says: 'We have never got it
out of perspective, and tourism cannot replace the old traditional
industries, but but it can have a growing role in bringing much needed
employment to the area.'
Mid Glamorgan, despite its image of valleys scarred by pitheaps and
steelworks, has always had some effective tourism cards to play, including
an unspoilt stretch of coastline, the family seaside resort of Porthcawl,
wild moorland including the fringes of the Brecon Beacons, and Caerphilly
Castle, one of the greatest surviving medieval castles in Europe, rivalled
in size in the UK only by Windsor.
What has been happening in recent years has been the addition to this list
of examples of the area's unique industrial history. Rhondda heritage park
is probably the best known example of the local community's determination to
construct a future from its past.
Despite the relatively undeveloped state of the county's tourist industry,
it already employs more than 4,000 people, which puts it ahead of transport,
metal manufacture and vehicles, and the trend is upwards. If indirect
employment and the multiplier effect of tourists' spending is taken into
account, the total exceeds 7,000.
The tourism potential of the industrial heritage of the valleys began to be
appreciated in the mid 1980s. A marketing campaign, starting from modest
beginnings, was given added impetus in 1987 when Ebbw Vale in neighbouring
Gwent was chosen for the 1982 national garden festival.
The intention was to give visitors to the coast and to the urban centres of
Cardiff, Swansea and Newport a reason for going up into the valleys, and a
series of attractions for day visitors was promoted.
'We were given a boost by the garden festival,' says Mr Loveluck. 'It
achieved one of its objectives of changing people's perceptions of this part
of Wales, and many of the festival's 2m visitors have either returned to the
valleys or have said they will.'
A tourism strategy for the area was launched in 1988 and an initial Pounds
1m was allocated to tourism projects in the industrial valleys. When this
was used up in a year, additional resources were found.
The campaign has been geared essentially to day visitors, but in 1990
accommodation began to be promoted in order to persuade visitors to stay
longer. There was plenty of room for improvement as the available hotel and
bed and breakfast accommodation in the mid-80s was sparse and often of
indifferent quality.
The situation has now improved substantially, and much better hotel, guest
house and self-catering accommodation is available.
Since 1988 the tourist board has deployed Pounds 1.4m on projects in the
valleys, with a special emphasis on the Rhymney Valley, one of the most
deprived following the demise of the mining industry.
Eleven projects were earmarked for help, including a golfing hotel, five
other hotels, a farm project, a water skiing centre and a country park.
The biggest new attraction in the valleys is probably Rhondda heritage park
on the site of the Lewis Merthyr colliery north of Pontypridd, which closed
in 1983. The old buildings have been transformed into big industrial
theatres, bringing to life the story of coal. A new programme on energy has
just been launched, and next year a trip underground will be included.
In contrast, one of the best examples of a semi-fortified Tudor manor house,
Llancaiach Fawr Manor at Nelson in the Rhymney valley, has won awards for
its recreation of life at the time of the civil war. Actors and local people
dressed in authentic costumes and speaking in 17th century dialect bring the
period to life.
Further south on the borders of Mid Glamorgan is Llanerch vineyard, which
with its six acres of German and French vine varieties, is the only vineyard
in the principality to bottle its wine on the estate.
The county has four country parks and all offer a range of recreational
activities for the family including walks, picnic and barbecue sites and
children's playgrounds. At Parc Cwm Darran, near Bargoed, lakes provide one
of the finest coarse fisheries in south Wales. Dare Valley near Aberdare has
a visitor centre, fishing and horseriding, Bryngarw near Bridgend has a
Japanese garden, and Bryn Bach near Rhymney has waterskiing and windsurfing.
Although the promotion of tourism by the Wales Tourist Board, the Welsh
Development Agency and local authorities is seen as an end in itself in
generating more jobs, it will do something equally significant.
The enhanced infrastructure of better roads, hotels and attractions will
play a valuable part in persuading potential inward investors to choose the
area because of its enhanced quality of life. The valleys will no longer be
seen as an area that has lost its way with the demise of king coal.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (5): The pattern varies / A look at
the property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE availability of industrial and commercial property has risen to worrying
heights during the recession, but there are signs that inward investors are
beginning to show more interest in moving to the county.
At first glance the property situation looks grim. Mid Glamorgan, with some
3.8m square feet of industrial floorspace on the market, has the highest
level of availability since 1983.
Alarmingly, the amount of floorspace is continuing to rise - there has been
a 500 per cent increase in industrial property available since the lowest
figure reported in 1989 of 600,000 square feet. The latest level represents
a 10.5 per cent vacancy rate for the county, which is significantly higher
than elsewhere in south Wales.
However, the pattern varies substantially across the county, and the news is
by no means all bad.
Mr David Swallow, private funding director of the Welsh Development Agency,
which is responsible for 70 per cent of the industrial and commercial
development in the county either by itself or in partnership with private
companies, is optimistic. 'Throughout the recession we have maintained the
20 per cent of UK inward investment coming into Wales, and we think this
will continue.'
'What we have seen recently is a big reduction in speculative development as
elsewhere and an increase in bespoke schemes ...the level here has been
maintained very well. We have started to see a definite improvement since
Christmas in the level of inquiries.'
The greatest take-up levels of industrial property during the last year have
been in the smaller size ranges, with a net decrease in availability of
property below 5,500 sq ft.
An analysis of property demand carried out by the Mid Glamorgan economic
development unit of the county council confirmed that demand continues to be
highest for properties within the smaller size bands. This demonstrates the
growing importance of the small companies sector in the local economy,
particularly in the former coal mining valleys.
There has also been steady demand for premises along, or near to, the M4
corridor. This has prompted the Welsh Development Agency to enter into joint
venture agreements with various developers to ensure that sufficient space
is available when demand increases.
Both WDA and Brunswick clearly expect demand for commercial and industrial
property to increase, and around 150,000 sq ft of floorspace is being built
on the site, including two 25,000 sq ft factory units.
The Llantrisant area, which also has a business park, has proved to be a
popular location with both public and private sector developers, because of
its excellent road communications and full development area status. This
allows investment projects securing employment to apply for a range of
incentives, including regional selective assistance.
The other flagship development is at Nantgarw, south of Caerphilly and
Pontypridd, where the 100 acre development on the site of old coking works
is a joint venture between the WDA and Spen Hill Properties.
Many units have already been let and a planning application make by a Hong
Kong based electronics company seeking to build a 160,000 sq ft factory
which would create 1,000 jobs. If this goes ahead it would be one of the
biggest projects to go to south Wales since Sony completed its television
factory at Pencoed near Bridgend last year.
Mr Rhys James, a director of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, local agents for Spen
Hill, admits the Nantgarw experience has been exceptional.
'In general it has been a very difficult time. There have been signs of a
slight recovery in 1993, although companies are understandably very cautious
and are only moving when they feel they have got a particularly good deal.'
In general, the area close to the M4 and the area in the west of the county
around Bridgend have survived the recession reasonably well, helped by the
smart new Sony factory and more developments by Ford. The local industrial
estates are accessible and well established.
It is the towns in the former mining valleys that have found the going
tougher, and it is in this area that infrastructure improvements are now
planned to attract inward investment.
There are plans to redevelop the town centre at Merthyr Tydfil and to
continue the A470 dual carriageway west of the town to link up with the
heads of the valley road, giving much easier access to the M50 and the
Midlands. 'We see this potentially as a great benefit to the whole of the
north of the county,' says Mr Swallow.
Other initiatives in the pipeline are the redevelopment of town centres and
retail areas in Abercynon, Caerphilly, Pontypridd and Tredegar.
Ironically, the improved road links from the valleys down to the excellent
shopping facilities of Cardiff have adversely affected retailers in the
valley towns, and the town centre developments are aimed at reversing this
trend.
Mid Glamorgan and the industrial valleys have undoubtedly benefitted greatly
in attracting inward investment in recent years from development and
assisted area status, but there is apprehension that this advantage might
soon be weakened, if the status is changed in the new lists to be published
shortly.
Loss of government and European Community aid would make the attempts to
cure the continuing employment blackspots much harder to achieve.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (6): Sandwich courses thrive -
University of Glamorgan / Tradition of vocational study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE founders of the South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines could
hardly have imagined in 1913 that this highly specialised establishment
would develop into a fully fledged university with a comprehensive
prospectus.
A remarkable history of change and development lies behind the University of
Glamorgan, which currently has more than 8,000 full-time students, 14
departments and 400 academic staff.
The story started with the need to train and educate people to run the mines
of south Wales, and the Coal Act of 1911 laid down that 'an approved diploma
or degree, together with practical experience of mining, was necessary for
any person to be qualified for a certificate of competency to manage a
colliery.'
This obliged colliery owners to recognise the need for formal schooling,
leading to a recognised qualification, and 18 local pit owners decided
jointly to set up and finance a school of mines.
The location chosen was Treforest near Pontypridd, and the ideal building
was identified as Forest House built by the Crawshay family, prominent
ironmasters in south Wales. The new school was opened in 1913. The most
notable aspect of curriculum development was the emphasis on practical
training, combined with the theoretical rigour of an academic course.
One of the first sandwich courses in the country was introduced at the
school, enabling students to be seconded from their employers for study at
the college. This brought education to students who had previously been
unable to give up employment and income to study.
Sandwich courses continue to be a vital element of study for degree courses
and diplomas in higher education. Professor Adrian Webb, the recently
appointed first vice-chancellor of the university, says: 'We really need to
stick closely to our vocational mission ...our intention must be to do less
on campus and more on site in private industry and in the public sector.'
Prof Webb, who took up his appointment in April from Loughborough, believes
maximum emphasis has to be placed on in-service training and on constantly
up-dating practical and academic studies. 'I think this is very much what
industry needs ...it's the very opposite of an ivory tower.'
Following the government's white paper on higher education in 1957 the then
Glamorgan Technical College was redesignated as an area college and again
retitled, this time as Glamorgan College of Technology. Eight years later,
Mr Antony Crosland, then education secretary, proposed the introduction of
polytechnics and in 1970 the college was redesignated Glamorgan Polytechnic.
More changes followed in 1975 when the polytechnic merged with Glamorgan
College of Education at Barry to form the Polytechnic of Wales. The merger
worked well, but two years ago the initial teacher training role was
withdrawn from the polytechnic, which reverted to a one-site campus at
Pontypridd.
It was the only polytechnic in Wales, and this created an internal argument
about whether it was sensible to lose this distinction in order to become a
university when the status of all polytechnics was changed last autumn.
In the end the demands of marketing, particularly to overseas students, won
and the poly became the University of Glamorgan last September. However,
this should not lead to substantial changes in academic or practical goals.
A company, the University of Glamorgan Commercial Services, was established
last year to handle all commercial activity and to act as the focal point
for links with industry. In another innovation, there are franchise courses
with local colleges and with educational establishments in Greece and
Malaysia.
Prof Webb believes that the inevitable pressures to 'chase the universities'
tails' should be resisted by the former polytechnics, or by Glamorgan at
least. He cites the change of status by the colleges of advanced technology
(CATs) when they became universities, when some found themselves poor
relations of the older, more traditional universities.
'There is a real chance that the polytechnics could end up at the bottom of
the pile by chasing the university model. Our strategic plan must lead us to
build on the traditional polytechnic model. Our mission remains largely
vocational and this has great benefit both for employers and for the local
community.'
The university received one of the prestigious partnership awards, given as
a mark of excellence in course design and teaching, in each of the last two
years, and this year it has won two - a rare achievement. Prof Webb says:
'We succeeded in this national competition because our courses are well
taught, and they are closely geared to what students need and to what
employers are looking for in potential employees.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (3): Cleaning up the town - Urban
regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE best part of two centuries, a vast unsightly mound known as the
Georgetown tip has dominated the centre of Merthyr Tydfil, 'capital' of the
valleys of south Wales. Over the years, it has become covered by scrub,
bushes and the detritus of modern life.
The tip is iron ore, industrial despoil from when Merthyr was the undisputed
iron town of the world. Today, bulldozers are working flat out to remove the
tip and create land which can be turned to creative use.
What is happening in Merthyr is not unique. Throughout Mid Glamorgan, indeed
across the whole of Wales, urban improvements are being undertaken. Partly,
the reason is commercial: to create the sort of conditions that would appeal
to inward investment. Partly, though, it is also an acceptance that people
in towns which prosperity has only lightly touched are equally entitled to
live in pleasant surroundings.
The government, acting through the Welsh Development Agency, has an
important programme of urban regeneration schemes for Wales. Last December
Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh secretary, announced a Pounds 28.4m package
of urban aid in the present financial year for 228 projects, 10 more than
last year. A third is going to what Mr Hunt called 'the most deprived
parts'. Mid Glamorgan qualifies under that heading. Schemes in Caerphilly,
Pontypridd, Tylerstown and Tonypandy in the Rhondda, and the Cynon Valley as
well as Merthyr have been backed.
In Caerphilly, car parking and what the bureaucrats call 'traffic calming'
are to be supported. In Cynon Valley, largely Aberdare and Mountain Ash,
road schemes, business development and general environmental projects are
being backed. In the Rhondda an important investment is to take place at the
heritage park, once a large colliery. Footpaths, car parks, commercial
developments, wash-and-brushups for shops and factories, landscaping,
pedestrianisation projects and relief roads have or are all being backed.
General responsibility for these projects has been delegated to the WDA,
although they are all joint ventures between the agency, the government and
the local authorities, often with participation from the private sector.
David Farnsworth, director of urban development at the WDA, is in charge of
the programme. He emphasises that the essential characteristic of the
programme is a joint venture among all concerned.
Beyond that, though, he believes the agency is pioneering a new form of
approach. 'What we are doing is undertaking an all-Wales programme, an
approach that is almost certainly unique in Europe. We want to help each
town find its niche in the new economy that is emerging here,' he says.
'Urban regeneration has never been seen positively before. It has always
been something undertaken in reaction to a set of events, a reaction to
industrial despoilage, to personal deprivation, to environmental
shortcomings. Now, our programme is about the way ahead.
'The key to our approach lies in effective public-sector management. It is
not about money, though that is certainly needed. It is about public
management.
'The traditional approach to the management of towns has been to spend money
on a problem when it arises. But towns are complicated market places that
succeed as a result of their ability to attract the investment that will
provide jobs and economic uplift.
'The Welsh urban programme is attempting to change traditional approaches so
that opportunities become the most important factor in the equation. This
means that instead of taking a departmental approach, as town halls have
invariably done in the past, looking at roads for instance through the eyes
of the chief engineer, we want to see the town as a whole.
'Because we at the agency are outside, though close to, the nexus of local
and central government we can stand back and reconcile traditional
differences between Whitehall and the town hall. Internecine arguments
between these centres of government put off investors and so create
potential harm for a town's future.'
The European Commission was sufficiently impressed by this approach to call
David Farnsworth to Brussels at the end of March for a meeting with DG 16,
the regional directorate. 'The commission felt our approach represented a
model for other parts of Europe,' Mr Farnsworth says.
'Consequently, the EC wants to talk to us again about aspects of our
programme which could be used as a model for other parts of the community.
They are keen for us to package our concept of public-sector management in a
way that can be used by others.'
Meetings behind closed doors in an office in Brussels may seem a long way
from what is happening at the Georgetown tip in Merthyr Tydfil. Looked at
from the other side, though, the bulldozers in Merthyr represent the active
end of a policy the European Commission thinks might be equally applicable
in Lombardy or Navarre.
Certainly, the urban programme being led by the WDA is seen as a priority by
the agency's board. This year it will be investing some Pounds 30m alongside
partners in 32 towns across Wales.
That sum represents about a fifth of the agency's budget. Four years ago,
when David Farnsworth arrived at the Cardiff headquarters of the agency,
that budget was just Pounds 4m. 'We have found a way of using money
effectively which is to the benefit of the whole economy,' he says.
'Effectiveness is the current buzzword. It's what the Americans call the big
bang for the buck. It is bringing together resources, perspectives, energy
and ideas.'
It is, and always will be, he insists, a joint approach, a joint venture
between all the partners associated with any urban community.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (2): Old industrial image dies hard
 -The south and the north of the county are two very different areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MID GLAMORGAN has an image problem. It is still widely perceived as heavily
industrialised, with old coal tips and abandoned ironworks scarring the
countryside.
In many ways this impression is understandable. The county has had a proud
industrial history and its core activities are in terminal decline - there
is now only one coal mine operating in the whole of south Wales compared
with 70 at the time of nationalisation in 1947.
The county remains the most industrialised part of Wales, and in parts it
has some of the poorest housing stock and lowest living standards in the UK.
Yet it is in many respects two counties, a curious mix of industry and
agriculture, mountains and seashore, wealth and poverty. The business
profile has changed dramatically in recent years as high tech has replaced
high stack.
The main boundary line is the M4 motorway which acts as a life line and
deliverer of inward investment, but which effectively divides the county in
two.
To the north lie the former coalmining valleys of the Rhondda, Rhymney and
Taff, potentially attractive with hills and woods, but where the scars of
the industrial revolution and the loss of jobs have brought the main
challenge of regeneration. To the south lies the other Glamorgan, a lush
coastal plain of rich farmland and pretty villages, and a varied coast with
great tourist potential.
To the east of the Ogmore river is an attractive heritage coast of cliffs
and coves centred on Ogmore and Southerndown, where development is strictly
controlled and where it is easy to escape the crowds by walking a few
hundred yards. To the west is the traditional family holiday resort of
Porthcawl, with a big caravan park recently upgraded, good sands and one of
the best golf courses in the country.
Porthcawl, where visiting international rugby teams once stayed before big
matches in Cardiff, is now faded, and has been in decline since its
Victorian and Edwardian heyday, but the local Ogwr borough council has put
forward a tourism strategy to revive its attractions.
Studies show that tourism, particularly in Porthcawl, with its Coney Beach
funfair attracts over 1m visitors a year, to the borough, contributes Pounds
25m to the local economy and supports 2,000 jobs.
It is, therefore, too important a facility to lose and plans have been put
forward for a town centre development at Porthcawl, including an inner
harbour for 200 boats, a swimming pool and residential and commercial
developments.
The borough of Ogwr, Welsh for Ogmore, is centred on Bridgend and is in many
ways quite different from the rest of the county. A study by Glasgow
University in 1990 on quality of life ranked Ogwr first among all Welsh
districts surveyed and among other districts along the M4 corridor.
It was seen as above average in its low-cost owner-occupied and private
rented accommodation, its cost of living, health and education provision,
and sports and shopping facilities.
Although the borough has a relatively high level of unemployment, this is
largely because of the influence of the north of the county, where
relatively few jobs have been created in the industrial valleys.
The corridor along the M4 has been a magnet for new industry, and inward
investment has held up remarkably well during the recession. Big
multinational names like Ford and Sony have led the move into Mid Glamorgan.
Ask any inward investor about the attractions of the area, and you will hear
of good communications, and a stable workforce.
On the map, south Wales might appear isolated and on the fringes of the
European Community, but from Tokyo or Detroit an uncluttered motorway,
generous grants and a relatively cheap workforce are more relevant
considerations.
A recent example is Sony, which has completed a Pounds 150m television
factory and research centre at Pencoed employing 1,400 to complement its
20-year-old facility at nearby Bridgend which now concentrates on the
production of cathode ray tubes.
Although few places in Mid Glamorgan are further than 30 minutes from the
motorway, there remains a perception that the valleys are isolated and it
has been much harder to attract new jobs.
The valleys remain the heart of south Wales and of Mid Glamorgan, however.
Because of their geological structure the valleys look south to the plain of
the Vale of Glamorgan. They rarely look east and west towards each other and
can therefore be self-contained and isolated.
A government report on Wales 20 years ago said that new industry in the
valleys had only partially replaced the old economic base of coal and steel.
In many valleys it was physically impossible, because of the lack of flat
land in the steep-sided terrain, to provide jobs on the necessary scale.
The conclusion was that the valley communities were likely to rely to an
increasing extent on work within reasonable travelling distance, and this
remains the view.
The valleys are bound to be at a relative disadvantage in attracting
development compared with the coastal plain, and the future must lie in
linking into the relative economic prosperity of the M4 corridor. The
valleys are no longer a separate economic entity; the two parts of the
county are set to become more interdependent.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (4): Valleys' blurred vision -
Anthony Moreton follows the progress of Lord Walker's initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG politicians it has become something of a tradition in Wales that St
David's Day should be celebrated with a package of economic and political
goodies for the principality. Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh Secretary, did
not disappoint his expectant audience on March 1.
The Valleys Programme was launched five years ago in the Rhondda by his
predecessor, now Lord Walker, to regenerate what was described as Wales's
only inner-city-type problem area. Now it was to be extended. Precise
details of how that was to be done were to come later.
For Lord Walker, the consummate political public-relations man, the
programme was a vehicle to breathe life into an area of Wales that had
suffered unduly from the rundown of structural industry, especially coal. An
invited audience was bemused when Walker outlined a vision in which south
Wales would, within a recognisable time, become one of the most prosperous
parts of Britain.
That Walker renaissance has still to occur. But if cynics and critics ask
what precisely has happened the government can point to an inflow of
investment and jobs, environmental changes and new town-centre schemes.
The valleys, as envisaged by both Walker and Hunt, are wider than the county
of Mid Glamorgan, although it remains at the heart of the initiative. 'The
important thing about the scheme,' says one former civil servant now leading
a quango, 'is that it focused attention on a part of Wales that had never
received its due share of support.
'It is no coincidence, for instance, that private contractors such as
Redrow, Bailey and Barratt are now building houses for sale in areas such as
the Rhondda and Merthyr Tydfil where they would never have ventured before.
This may be a small example but it could be multiplied as the programme
begins to take effect.'
Tony Roberts, chief executive of Cynon Valley council, concurs. 'The
programme has put attention firmly on the valleys, which is very much to
their benefit.'
Lord Walker's plan was to boost advance factory building by the Welsh
Development Agency, speed up the clearance of derelict land, increase urban
aid, support the arts and tourism and improve 32,000 houses, as well as the
health services.
The eye-catching statistic, though, was unemployment. He prophesied that it
would drop from 37,000 to about 12,000. But other figures were almost as
revolutionary: public investment of Pounds 500m in economic and social
activities, leading to a private sector injection of Pounds 1bn.
Paradoxically, the modern printing company where Lord Walker chose to make
his announcement has fallen on hard times, a victim of the recession he was
not to foresee. Generally, though, the forecasts have been achieved. Last
month David Hunt opened a car door-panel factory in Merthyr owned jointly by
Japanese and French concerns. Ford has spent large sums at its engine plant
in Bridgend and spark-plug factory in Treforest; EMMS, an American company,
has invested Pounds 272m at Caerphilly; other investment has come from the
US, Germany, Singapore and South Korea.
Mr Hunt said recently Pounds 780m has been invested since the programme was
launched, 2.6m sq ft of industrial space has been built, more than 2,000
acres of derelict land cleared and Pounds 700m of private investment
attracted.
Within Mid Glamorgan, more than Pounds 64m has been spent on new or better
roads, according to Hugh Thomas, the county's chief executive. Passenger
railway services have been improved, 100 acres of derelict land reclaimed
last year and a tourist attraction developed at the Rhondda Heritage Park on
the site of the former Lewis Merthyr colliery.
Both government and county point to a commendable record, more commendable
still given the depth of the recession. Cynon Valley's Tony Roberts believes
the Valleys Programme has not only put a spotlight on the area but also
'underpinned the need for a partnership in getting things moving. The way in
which everyone has worked together for the benefit of the community -
government, local authorities, tourist board, Welsh Development Agency,
local enterprise agencies - is a model for the rest of the country,' he
says.
He concedes that the programme's beneficial effects 'have been hijacked by
the recession'. Any appraisal of results must take that recession into
account, he says. Even so, solid progress has been made.
Walker's vision of unemployment down to 12,000 remains a long way off. The
number out of work in April in Mid Glamorgan was 26,704, which suggests
there has only been a slight improvement on 37,000 in the whole area in
1988.
But David Hunt has said: 'There are over 10,000 people working in the
valleys who would be unemployed if the area had followed the national
trend'.
Others are more critical. Labour's Welsh spokesman, Ron Davies, says that
'unless the Valleys Programme is replaced by a more positive scheme of
investment in jobs, manufacturing industry and community regeneration, we
shall fail to break the cycle of deprivation and under-achievement in the
area. Valley communities will continue to decline.'
The failure of the Walker-Hunt scheme, he says, is that while the valleys
may be greener 'no foundations have been built for durable local economies'.
Better transport services are needed, improved education and training
systems, an innovation centre at the University of Glamorgan, one-stop shops
set up for small business development and a greater integration of the
valleys' industrial base with that of south Wales.
One outside commentator, Dr Kevin Morgan, of University College, Cardiff,
believes 'the social and economic plight of parts of the valleys is as acute
as ever and a series of new and bolder initiatives is needed to reinforce
the momentum.' The programme, which he calls 'a necessary initiative,' is '
not sufficient to regenerate the area, given current funding'.
But the programme has had positive effects. 'It has placed the political
spotlight on the valleys and nourished the principle of partnership.' This
is one of the keys to social and economic regeneration, he says.
Tony Roberts agrees, saying: 'The future lies not just in the 'positive
partnership' between everyone involved in the health of the valleys, as
advocated by the secretary of state, but in a equal partnership. This means
adequate funding for all the authorities.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (1): Divided by inequalities -

AT THE southern entrance to Merthyr Tydfil, across the road from Hoover's
European headquarters, Maya Sakata, a Singapore company, has just begun
production of electrical cord assemblies. When it gears up to full
production, the company expects to turn out 120,000 parts a week.
'We chose Merthyr in preference to sites in the north-east of England or the
republic of Ireland,' says Mr Melvyn Mitchell, its managing director, 'for
two reasons: the excellent communications; and the close proximity of other
companies in the Far East, such as Malaysia.'
One of those companies is within sight. Sekisui was only the second Japanese
company to invest in Wales when it arrived in Britain nearly 20 years ago.
Across the industrial park in Merthyr from Maya Sakata is another recent
arrival: R-TEK, a joint Japanese-French joint venture making car door panels
for Honda and Rover.
There is nothing exceptional about these new investments in Mid Glamorgan.
In the past 18 months British Airways has announced a Pounds 23m avionics
workshop at Llantrisant which will create 400 jobs; Robertson Associates, an
American-German company, is spending Pounds 13.5m on a plant at Nantgarw to
produce aluminium can ends for brewers; and two companies have gone to
Hengoed, outside Caerphilly - Valeo Wipers Systems and Jones Chromatography.
In addition, existing employers such as Ford at Bridgend and Treforest, EMMS
at Caerphilly, Gooding-Sanken at Abercynon and Purolite International at
Pontyclun have set in motion investment plans totalling over Pounds 150m.
These are investment decisions for which most parts of Britain would
mortgage half their future. Yet Mid Glamorgan remains one of the poorest
counties in Britain, afflicted by low gross domestic product, poor housing,
bad health, inadequate further education and social deprivation. It is a
paradox that in the middle of investment success there exist some of the
worst housing estates, such as Penrhys in Rhondda, Gurnos in Merthyr and
Penywaun in Aberdare.
Mid Glamorgan is two counties socially just as it is two counties
geographically; the M4 motorway corridor divides it into unequal parts.
To the south of the motorway, and within a band of four or five miles to its
north, lies a county of prosperous farming, a short but attractive coastline
with a holiday industry, and settled industry, especially around Bridgend.
The M4 has been a magnet, sucking industry in. Income levels, house prices,
school facilities and transport links here are good. Most new arrivals,
including those in nearby South Glamorgan such as Bosch and British Airways
at Cardiff airport, mentioned the motorway as a deciding factor when they
chose south Wales.
Further north, the steep-sided valleys make it much more difficult to
attract new industry. Some has come, but with the exception of Hoover in
Merthyr - which arrived in the town more than 40 years ago as a result of
the then government's direction of industry to the distressed areas -
Gooding in Aberdare, AB Electronics at Abercynon and a few others, most of
the newcomers have been small employers. Closures, such as in the mining
industry, have cost large numbers of jobs; the arrivals have not made up the
losses.
The valleys have had to come to terms with massive structural change. They
were built on coal and iron. The latter went early in this century but coal
remained a big employer until the 1984-5 strike. There were still 28
collieries in south Wales, most of them in Mid Glamorgan, in 1985, when the
men drifted back to work; today, two of the three left in south Wales are in
the county.
Yet the county's industrial heritage lingers on. Mid Glamorgan has
proportionately more employed in metal manufacturing, engineering,
electronics and general manufacturing than the UK as a whole.
With coal went jobs for men. With the new industries came jobs for women.
Many of them were part-time and low paid. Almost half the workforce (49 per
cent) are women and a quarter part-time. Service industries, according to
Martyn Thomas and Tim Peppin in a report for Mid Glamorgan county council,
account for 58 per cent of employees; 10 years ago the proportion was 43 per
cent.
Many of the plants pay lower wages than elsewhere, a factor which has helped
bring in the newcomers. The average weekly wage for men in Mid Glamorgan
last year, according to the government's New Earnings Survey, was Pounds
302, only 88.8 per cent of the British figure of Pounds 340.1.
This disparity has been widening. Fourteen years ago rates were more or less
in parity with those in Britain, according to Thomas and Peppin. Women, too,
have suffered, though not so severely, dropping to 93 per cent of the
British average.
Other indicators are equally bad. Unemployment at 14.9 per cent is the
highest in Wales. Long-term unemployment and that among the very young is
high.
In some of the valleys a quarter of the people live alone, many of them in
single-parent families. According to the county's economic research unit,
'the health of the people compares unfavourably with that of other areas of
Wales. One in five people claims to suffer from a 'limiting long-term'
illness. In the Rhondda the figure is one in four.'
Car ownership, another indicator of prosperity, is also low. Some 37 per
cent of households, according to the survey, are without a car, the highest
figure for any of Wales's eight counties. The figure is particularly high by
British standards in the Rhondda, at 45 per cent.
Not all the indicators are depressing. 'There is enormous vitality in the
valleys,' says Mr Tony Roberts, chief executive of the Cynon Valley council.
'With the partnership between local authorities, government, Welsh
Development Agency and other bodies such as the Wales Tourist Board which is
now taking place, the foundations are being laid for advances as the century
ends.'
On the up-side there have been big improvements in housing, more jobs for
women, more young people in continuing education and the highest population
of working age among the Welsh counties.
A lot of these improvements have been made on the back of an improved
infrastructure. The motorway is the core of the road system and few places
within the county are more than 25 minutes from it. The government has
improved the spine roads linking the valleys to the motorway. Merthyr, the
Rhondda, Llantrisant, Ystrad Mynach and Maesteg are all now connected in
part or whole to the M4 by dual-carriageway or three-lane roads.
The black spot remains the heads of the valleys road, the A465, which runs
across the north of the industrial belt and which links it to the English
Midlands. Local authorities, MPs, the CBI and the Institute of Directors
have repeatedly called for this road to be widened from three lanes.
Two years ago the government conceded the case - both on grounds of economic
efficiency and safety - for improving the road between Abergavenny in the
east and Aberdare to dual-carriageway at a cost of Pounds 145m. Sadly, it
took two more years for the Welsh Office to commission a study, which itself
will take three years to complete, and the improved road is not likely to be
completed before the end of the century.
Improvements in the rail network have also been undertaken, and passenger
growth on British Rail's services from the valleys into Cardiff and Newport
has been one of the largest in Britain.
'The days when we all worked independently have gone,' says Mr Roberts.
'Partnership is at the heart of the new economy. If we get our towns right,
as in the urban schemes being undertaken by the local authorities and the
Welsh Development Agency, then new investment will come.
'Five years ago the first private housing since the war was undertaken in
the Rhondda by the Barratt group. The Welsh Office had to offer an
inducement through an urban grant to bring the company in. Today builders
such as Redrow and Bailey are putting up houses in a number of places.'
It is that indicator, more than any other, that points the way to the
future. The WDA provides free sites and advance factories have been put up.
In the middle of the recession, builders built houses and sold them, many to
first-time buyers - a significant indicator of the underlying strength of
the economy.

FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that Wednesday's mould-breaking agreement between British
Telecom and MCI of the US might lead to other giant cross-border deals
prompted sharp rises in both Cable and Wireless and Vodafone. The fuel for
the rumours were suggestions from industry commentators as to how such
powerful international telecoms groups as AT&amp;T might react to the threat of
the potential global alliance posed by the BT/MCI tie-up.
However, London telecoms specialists were sceptical, arguing that the wide
range of joint ventures and marketing agreement already existing between the
industry leaders would complicate any similar moves.
In addition, not all press and market comment on the BT deal was positive,
with the scale of the financing bringing the comment from one telecoms
analyst that: 'BT has got it all to prove now.' BT shares fell 3 1/2 to
418p, C&amp;W gained 9 to 753p aided by recommendations from Hoare Govett and
Goldman Sachs, while Vodafone climbed 13 to 456p on good turnover of 9m.
A bout of profit-taking took the wind out of the sails of the major property
stocks, which had surged on Wednesday follwoing the news of Mr George Soros'
move into the sector. British Land, which will link up with Mr Soros,
dropped 26 to 318 x-d, Land Securities 8 to 575p and MEPC 5 to 443p. The
latter's results yesterday showed further confirmation of the slow
turnaround in the property market. NatWest Securities raised its net asset
value forecast from 400p to 450p for this year.
Investor attention turned instead to some of the second line property
stocks, where Asda Property jumped 8 to 93p, and Chesterfield 10 to 370p.
In Banks, TSB put on 4 to 189p, with Strauss Turnbull said to have been
shopping for stock.
Shares in Sidlaw Group, the oil services, packaging and textiles company,
jumped 20 to 350, after announcing that it had received a letter of intent
from Amoco for a 10-year contract to provide logistics support in the North
Sea.
Elsewhere in the sector, BP retreated in early trading on certainty
regarding the implications of the collision of one of its tankers with a
cargo ship off the Belgian coast. However, as the stock market rallied
later, the shares recovered and closed 2 ahead at 308p, after trade of 7.6m.
Norcros closed 3 down at 165p, after surprising the market with a 2-for-7
rights issue to raise Pounds 49.7m. Profits were down from Pounds 15.6m to
Pounds 11.5m, although the dividend was maintained. Bumper profits at Rowe
Evans sent the shares climbing 12 to 53p.
The threat of a 24-hour strike at British Airways today overshadowed an
announcement of a 7.8 per cent year-on-year increase in May passenger
traffic figures. The shares gave up 6 1/2 to 297 1/2 p, in trade of 2.2m.
The good passenger traffic figures were appreciated at BAA where the shares
closed 4 ahead at 767p.
The positive mood in the property sector and continuing recovery in the
housing market continued to boost P&amp;O and the shares gained another 8 to
616p. Volume was 1.3m.
Shipbuilding and submarine group VSEL Consortium raced 26 ahead to 795p,
after it reported full year figures ahead of market expectations. Profits
jumped 16 per cent to Pounds 55.6m and the company also increased the
dividend. Charterhouse Tilney predicted profits for the year to March 1994
would come in at Pounds 63m.
Profit-taking and a more cautious outlook following Wednesday's figures saw
Vosper Thornycroft ease 7 to 588p.
Shares in motor components group T &amp; N closed 7 ahead at 184p, after strong
demand which followed a successful placing of its shares at 170p, to raise
Pounds 36.9m. Sentiment was further enhanced by a positive recommendation
from Strauss Turnbull for motor component stocks.
British Aerospace shares put on another 3 to 370p.
Cautious press comment after Wednesday's results put the skids under Siebe.
The shares closed 7 lower at 477p, having been lower earlier in the day. A
cautious annual meeting at Glynwed International left the shares 2 lighter
at 299p.
Plans to increase prices on some of its products together with a
recommendation from SG Warburg sent British Steel through the 100p barrier
to close 3 ahead at 102 1/2 p, in trade of 10m shares. ASW rose on the same
sentiment and finished 5 ahead at 220p.
Zeneca, the recently demerged bioscience arm of ICI, announced that three
investment institutions had, in accordance with Stock Exchange rules,
notified it of shareholdings. Zeneca shares continued weak, on the general
uncertainty overhanging the sector, closing 8 adrift at 626p. ICI rose 13
1/2 to 687p.

FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A change in stance on Forte by Kleinwort Benson, one of the market's leading
brokers in the hotel sector, added support to the stock's recent strength as
the broker turned buyer for the first time in two years. Kleinwort, which
admitted the change but refused any other comment, is believed to have
focused on recent management changes and the slow but gathering momentum in
the hotel market.
Forte is thought to be on the verge of appointing a former Savoy executive
to its management team in what observers say could be the opening shot in
its effort to takeover the group. Under an agreement with Savoy, Forte is
unable to make an offer until November 1994. Forte shares added 2 to 200p,
while the tightly-traded Savoy was steady at 785p.

Hints from Boots that it might be losing patience with its loss-making Do It
All home improvement chain were reported by analysts after attending the
company's post-results meeting yesterday. Do It All, owned as a joint
venture with WH Smith, has been badly buffeted by the recession and has
suffered from stiff competition from leading rivals, Texas and B&amp;Q.
In January, Smith's share of losses from Do It All were Pounds 8.4m, leading
some stores specialists to question the strategy of both groups making any
further investment in the venture. Yesterday, Boots said its Do It All
losses were Pounds 14.4m. One analyst commented: 'We believe that if
business does not improve within six months, Boots will decide to either
sell or pull out.' Otherwise, Boots results were largely in line with
expectations and the shares slipped 3 to 444p.

FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours seen in bid move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG rumours that Airtours, the UK's third biggest tour operator, is
considering buying travel group Hogg Robinson sent shares in both companies
sharply forward yesterday. Leisure analysts said they believed negotiations
for an agreed offer had reached an advanced stage, although they declined to
put a potential purchase price on such a deal.
Airtours has made no secret of its desire to make an aquisition in the
travel agency market to consolidate last year's purchase of Pickford's. The
move would also be a consolation for Airtours' failure earlier this year to
capture Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator; this market
assault left Airtours, the predator, with an estimated Pounds 50m war chest.
Leisure specialists said that Hogg Robinson, which has over 200 retail
outlets, would be a good fit with Pickfords. Airtours paid Pounds 16m for
Pickford's 333 branches. A spokesman for Airtours said: 'We never comment on
market rumours.' Airtours shares gained 6 1/2 to 301p, while Hogg Robinson
added 4 to 190p.

FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profits taken as turnover recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME OF the bounce went out of the UK stock market yesterday as it
approached the end of a successful equity market account without any sign of
the interest rate cuts which have been predicted in some quarters. Share
trading volume was reduced and share prices were led downwards for much of
the session by weakness in stock index futures.
UK equities opened lower and extended their losses in early trading, without
waiting for confirmation from the Bundesbank policy meeting that no action
was being taken on German interest rates. With the June contract on the
FT-SE Index at a discount at one time, there was little support for the blue
chips, although ICI continued to benefit from switching out of Zeneca as
investors backed away from pharmaceutical stocks.
The Footsie was 18 points off at just under 2,845 by mid-morning, but then
rallied in moderate trading as some rate cut optimism returned. The early
loss was cut by about one half before a poor start on Wall Street, which
shed 18 Dow points in early trade, put London into reverse again.
The final reading of 2,852.8 on the FT-SE Index showed a loss on the day of
10.2 points. The two week account has brought a recovery in the equity
market which had touched the lower end of its perceived trading range, and
dealers said that some profits were being taken yesterday ahead of the close
of the account tonight.
Property shares, which bounced ahead on Wednesday in response to the joint
Pounds 284m joint venture between Mr George Soros and British Land, gave
back some ground yesterday. Banks followed a similar path.
BT's move to take a Dollars 4.3bn stake in MCI, the US telecommunications
group, prompted excitement in the telecoms sector as industry experts looked
for the next move in the global communications struggle.
The Footsie remained last night around the middle of its trading range, but
traders began to show renewed concern over valuation of the equity market
and its rating against government bonds.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index which has been outperforming the Footsie and closed
at a new peak on Wednesday, slipped back by 7.8 to 3,183.6 yesterday.
However, trading in the non-Footsie stocks which make up a significant part
of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, provided only about 56 per cent of yesterday's
Seaq volume total of 568.2m. On Wednesday, 601.9m shares traded through the
Seaq network for a retail or customer valuation of Pounds 1.19bn.
Market strategists hope that institutional liquidity will soon begin to
improve as the ICI/Zeneca demerger is absorbed and the BT3 sale gets under
way. Lack of liquidity has been a restaining factor in an equity market
still overshadowed by government financing plans in the government bond
sector.
While the change of UK chancellors of the exchequer has raised hopes that
the new man, Mr Kenneth Clarke, might be inclined to take the political
benefits of cutting domestic interest rates, some dealers were pointing
yesterday to the relatively soft performance of sterling in recent sessions.
But, on the other side of the debate, there are widespread expectations in
London that other continental European countries may cut rates in the near
future.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets suffered a nervous and finally unsuccessful session
yesterday, although trading volume was below normal levels, writes Terry
Byland. In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE Index ranged between a
healthy premium and a small discount against estimated fair value.
During the early part of the session when the June contract reached a
premium of around 12 points, there was some arbitraging between futures and
cash. But this quickly disappeared as the contract dipped to a 4 point
discount.
The big institutions played little part in futures dealing, however, and the
market trend was determined by two way activity by the locals, or
independent traders. The absence of any interest rate change by the
Bundesbank discouraged futures speculators at mid-session.
In traded options, volume totaled 24,467 contracts with the FT-SE option
contract taking up a major share with 13,778 contracts, nearly double the
total for the previous day. Individual contracts were featured by the
Euro-FTSE contract, where 2,659 traded, with Marks &amp; Spencer heading the
corporate list with 2,070 contracts.
There was activity in bank share options as some positions taken up on
Wednesday were reversed. NatWest options traded 1,810 contracts and Barclays
1,630.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities fall in wake of
rising gold prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS fell in subdued trading yesterday in the wake of a rally in gold
prices and some disappointing news on the jobs market, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.58 at 3,544.87. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.10 lower at 452.75, while the
Amex composite finished up 0.94 at 440.91, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.36
at 706.22. Trading volume on the NYSE was 280m shares.
Rising gold prices took their toll on equities right from the opening. The
price of August gold contracts jumped Dollars 5.40 to Dollars 376.30, an
indication that some investors continue to fear a revival in inflation.
Concern about the employment situation also hurt stocks after the Labor
department reported that the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance rose 5,000 last week, to 344,000. The figures indicate that
today's May employment report could reveal that the labour market remains
depressed, in spite of the growing economy. Wall Street analysts are
predicting that today's report will show a rise of about 50,000 in non-farm
payrolls, and national unemployment still stuck at 7 per cent.
One of the more eye-catching of new issues in recent months - the sale by
Sears, Roebuck of 20 per cent of its stake in Allstate, the insurance
company - was in strong demand. In the largest ever initial public offering
by a US company, 78.5m shares in AllState were issued at Dollars 27 a share
on Wednesday night. By the close yesterday, the stock was trading at Dollars
29 3/8 in volume of 26m shares.
Federal Express fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 after broking house
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to
'moderately attractive' in the wake of recent managerial resignations.
Computer stocks were mixed. While Hewlett-Packard gained Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 86 3/4 and Compaq put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 61 1/8 , Digital
Equipment fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 and Tandem Computer slipped
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 13.
Both Digital and Tandem were hit by ratings downgrades by securities house
Salomon Brothers.
Fieldcrest Cannon climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 5/8 on the news that
it is selling its carpet and rug operations to Mohawk Industries in a deal
valued at Dollars 140m.
Canada
TORONTO closed higher in busy trading, as a surge in world gold prices sent
gold-related stocks higher and helped boost the overall market.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 15.19 points, or 0.39%, to close at
3875.01.
Consumer products posted the day's biggest decline, off 1.6%, as Seagram,
the group's biggest stock, fell 1 1/4 to 34 1/8 . The company yesterday
reported a small improvement in first-quarter earnings, but said interest
expenses for its recent investment in Time-Warner Inc. would eat into cash
flow.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Major and minor bands in NZ equities -
Performance contrasts good economic news with a cautious market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caution is the overriding sentiment on the New Zealand stock market, five
months away from an unpredictable election outcome. Major shares are
determinedly stuck in a narrow trading band in spite of a solid flow of good
economic and positive business news.
The NZSE-40 capital index broke up briefly through the 1,650 mark last
Friday, set a 32-month high and promptly retreated. It recovered yesterday
to 1,649 but its all-time record of 3,850, set in 1987, remains a distant
memory.
This lacklustre performance is at odds with economic news. Yet it is backed
by the latest business surveys: the Lloyds Bank subsidiary, the National
Bank of New Zealand, said in its latest survey that business confidence had
fallen for the fourth month in a row, and was down 27 per cent from its
February high.
The bank's chief economist, Mr Girol Karacaoglu, said that it was difficult
to say why confidence was falling, although uncertainties about interest
rates, the general election and the electoral referendum on changing the
Westminster style, first-past-the-post voting system might be factors.
Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman of New Zealand's biggest company, Telecom
Corporation, is leading a high-profile campaign to persuade people to stay
with the present voting system. Uncertainties over the emergence of a
powerful third party, which could hold the balance of power in November, is
unsettling the business community further.
Interest rates remain stubbornly high. The exchange rate, which has
appreciated steadily since the Reserve Bank intervened to support it in
January, worries exporters.
However, positives abound. New Zealand's finance minister, Ms Ruth
Richardson, announced on Tuesday night that the budget deficit would be
NZDollars 700m less than predicted last year.
Other figures show an improving New Zealand debt position, substantial
surpluses on external trade and the balance of payments and inflation at one
per cent - among the lowest in the world.
Labour costs are down sharply due to the government's tough anti-union
legislation. Gross domestic product figures are encouraging. Against this,
unemployment remains stubbornly high.
Overseas investors, notably from the US, have been making the bulk of the
running in equities this year. In recent weeks they have stepped up their
buying of Brierley Investments, buying 120m shares in a month. It is
estimated that 40 per cent of the stock is now held offshore. American
investors have also been buying shares aggressively in Fletcher Challenge,
following recommendations by US brokers, and in Carter Holt Harvey, the
forestry company.
Telecom Corporation, controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, has been
another favourite since it announced a further restructuring which will cost
5,500 jobs by 1995. All these shares have shown strong gains so far this
year, although they have been marking time in recent trading.
Any dip in Wall Street seems to be quickly reflected in trading volumes in
New Zealand, although prices so far this year have held. New Zealand's
economic performance has been publicised extensively this year in the US,
where the government has been described as 'the last bastion of
Reaganomics'.
Many second line stocks are showing the benefits of substantial
restructuring. A company such as the lingerie maker, Ceramco, which has
eliminated debt and is making highly successful inroads into the Australian
and Asian economies, is typical of a corporate strain which has coped well
with New Zealand's protracted recession, and moved aggressively into
exporting.
Gold shares have been a recent bright spot. New Zealand has two of
Australasia's biggest producers. Mineral Resources, which is profitably
reworking the century-old former British-owned Martha Hill mine at Waihi,
south of Auckland, and Macraes Mining, which has been producing large
quantities of gold from ore near the southern city of Dunedin, have both
seen their share prices double in the past five weeks.
Meanwhile, prospecting stocks, such as Summit Gold, Kiwi Gold, and Gold
Resources, have fared much better than the producers. Their share prices
have risen by up to five times in recent trading.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.9 per
cent for a new high for the year

<TEXT>
INVESTORS were encouraged by currency factors as the Nikkei average rose 1.9
per cent to close above the 21,000 level for the first time since May 10,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 384.30 to 21,076.00, a new high for the year, after an
early low of 20,692.80 and a high of 21,186.33.
Volume rose to 611.6m shares from 433m, as life insurers and foreign
investors once again bought blue chip electricals. Advances led declines by
856 to 215, with 114 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose for the third consecutive day, gaining 30.67 to a year's high of
1,676.13 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.27 to 1,277.64.
Exporters were firm on the easing of the yen, as investors welcomed repeated
intervention by the Bank of Japan on the currency market. The dollar closed
at Y107.87, up Y0.75 from the previous day.
Foreign investors were net stock buyers for the fifth consecutive month in
April, buying a net Y1.3bn. However, analysts said that foreigners appeared
to be more cautious this month. A UK broker said that share prices were too
high considering that sluggish consumer spending and capital expenditure
were expected for the next few years.
High-technology stocks were traded actively. Fujitsu, the most active issue
of the day, rose Y11 to Y811. Forecasts of a 15 per cent increase in
semiconductor manufacturing equipment for the year to next March boosted
semiconductor equipment makers. Advantest rose Y160 to Y3,460.
Car stocks led the day's gains, advancing 3.1 per cent. Nissan Motor rose
Y30 to Y766 and Toyota Motor added Y60 to Y1,700.
Shipbuilders and steels were firmer. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
rose Y12 to Y520 on reports that the company had received orders for two gas
turbine power generation plants from Malaysia's public power corporation.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 311.26 to 23,375.22 in volume of 28.8m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets continued to put in a variety of performances.
HONG KONG dropped 2.3 per cent on heavy selling pressure, turnover rising
from HKDollars 3.9bn to HKDollars 5.5bn. The Hang Seng index fell 166.94 to
7,155.29 as worries persisted over a move by China to let its currency float
freely on some markets.
Investors continued to sell stocks with exposure to China. Hutchison led the
active list as it fell 50 cents to HKDollars 20.90. Cheung Kong shed 70
cents to HKDollars 27.30 and HSBC Holdings was off HKDollars 1.50 at
HKDollars 72.50.
SHANGHAI's B-Share index fell 2.9, or 4.9 per cent, to 56.45, while the
SHENZHEN Bs held relatively firm, off only 0.1 at 98.98. 'Foreign investors
lost their confidence in China's economy and currency,' said a broker.
SINGAPORE saw broadly based selling and a 42-point drop in the Straits Times
Industrial index at one point. Bargain hunting cut the loss to 20.83 at
1,869.48 as turnover rose from SDollars 437m to SDollars 499m.
SEOUL hit its highest level for more than two years before late
profit-taking dragged the composite index back to close just 3.34 higher at
763.15, after 768.16 in turnover up from Won985bn to Won1,170bn.
TAIWAN was pulled higher by late buying in financials, the weighted index
ending 40.49 higher at 4,342.73. Turnover was a slow TDollars 16.8bn against
Wednesday's TDollars 15.38bn.
KUALA LUMPUR fell across the board but bargain hunting near the end lifted
prices off the day's lows. The composite index closed down 6.21 at 735.06 in
volume of some 355m shares.
Renong and Idris lost 12 and 14 cents respectively to MDollars 2.69 and
MDollars 3.00.
BOMBAY closed higher on strong buying by foreign institutions and a finance
ministry statement that interest rates could be cut in the near future.
Ignoring fears of renewed unrest, the BSE index closed up 14.60 at 2,259.80.
MANILA returned to positive territory on late buying of selected blue chips.
The composite index gained 8.59 to 1,581.15 in turnover of some 287.9m
pesos.
The commercial and industrial sectors registered the day's best gains.
BANGKOK rose on demand for property stocks and a technical rebound in the
financial sector. The SET index ended up 11.18 or 1.4 per cent at 832.08 in
turnover of Bt4.8bn.
Property developer Krisda Mahanakorn gained Bt5 to Bt107 and Bangkok Land
Bt2 to Bt76.
JAKARTA registered a third successive high, the JKSE index rising 3.82 to
349.82. Brokers said interest was growing in banking, cement, and several
other liquid sectors.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sweden strengthens on
Procordia split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES showed a tendency towards improvement in the afternoon, in spite of
Wall Street's early declines, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM was boosted by the announcement that Procordia's pharmaceutical
and consumer products divisions were to be split, with Volvo taking a
controlling stake in the latter, to be called Branded Consumer Products. The
government also said that after the demerger it would sell its stake in
Procordia.
The shares responded with Volvo B's rising SKr16 or 4 per cent to SKr406 and
Procordia B's by SKr29 or 17.6 per cent to SKr193.
The news lifted the market overall, with the Affarsvarlden general index
putting on 22.40 or 2.1 per cent to 1,091.30 as turnover rose to SKr1.03bn.
Most analysts were satisfied with the announcement, noting that Volvo's cash
flow would be improved through BCP. However, some noted that given the
downturn in the European consumer products sector the group's recovery
growth might be 'dulled'.
FRANKFURT moved from early disappointment with German GDP figures to a small
rise on short covering at the end of the official session, after the
Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged. The DAX index closed 4.41 higher
at 1,629.62, turnover rising from DM3.7bn to DM4.3bn.
Volkswagen, up DM2.50 to DM319.50, put on another DM3 in the post bourse
after the AGM was told the company could break even this year after a first
half loss. The rise was obscured as the shares went ex a DM2 dividend and
its associated tax credit for domestic shareholders.
Viag, the energy-based conglomerate, climbed DM6.80 to DM350.80 for a
two-day gain of DM11.30, dealers saying that the appointment of a new
Bavarian prime minister had enhanced Viag's chances of a merger with
Bayernwerk, one of Germany's leading power utilities, currently owned 60 per
cent by the state of Bavaria, and 39 per cent by Viag.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on KLM which released fiscal 1993 results much in
line with analysts' forecasts. Encouraged by the figures, the shares moved
up 6 per cent, before easing slightly to Fl 26.30, a gain on the day of 90
cents, or 3.5 per cent. Mr Richard Brakenhoff, transport analyst at Pierson,
Heldring &amp; Pierson in Amsterdam, commented that the airline remained under
pressure, particularly in light of its large debt burden.
The CBS Tendency index put on 0.1 to 104.7.
PARIS suffered technical problems which suspended trading for a couple of
hours in the afternoon. As a result turnover was low at FFr1.6bn as the
CAC-40 index fell 7.92 to 1,867.92.
Both Peugeot and Michelin fell to new year lows following negative news this
week on prospects for European car sales. Peugeot lost FFr15 to Ffr515 and
Michelin FFr6.80 to FFr134.20.
MILAN settled back with many investors preferring to stay on the sidelines
ahead of this weekend's local elections. The Comit index closed off 3.61 at
538.19.
Fiat remained active following the publication of unexciting results on
Monday. The shares lost L161 to L5,649 and hit L5,580 on the kerb.
ZURICH closed on its end-May highs, strong financials and chemicals taking
the SMI index up 9.7 to 2,268.9. Insurers continued to narrow the
differentials with banks, Winterthur bearers adding SFr70 francs to
SFr3,270, Swiss Re SFr30 to SFr3,110 and Zurich SFr50 to SFr2,290.
Roche and Sandoz led chemicals, but other industrials put in the big share
price rises. Bearers in Ascom, the telecoms group, extended their recovery
from a strong fall some weeks ago, rising SFr75 to SFr1,265.
WARSAW tumbled, writes Christopher Bobinski. Poland's emerging equity
market, which has seen share prices rise by 175 per cent since Easter, fell
by 9.6 per cent yesterday.
All 18 stocks quoted on the exchange dropped, all but one of them down by 10
per cent, the maximum in any one session. This brought the WIG indicator
down from 3,710 on Tuesday, when it indicated some uncertainty with a 2 per
cent decline, to 3,354. Turnover was still high at 371.9bn zloty.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Money Markets: French rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE month interest rates in France again dipped below those in Germany
after the French franc consolidated its strength in the European exchange
rate mechanism and the Bundesbank left interest rate policy unchanged,
writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank decided not to change either its Lombard or discount rates at
its council meeting yesterday, but that outcome had been widely predicted by
the market.
Members of the German central bank's ruling council have expressed concern
in the last week about the potential weakness of the D-Mark, the rise in
German money supply and the increase in German bond yields.
Euromark futures were therefore more-or-less unchanged on the day. The June
contract closed unchanged day at 92.49 while the September contract closed 3
basis points higher at 93.30.
In the German cash market, call money was slightly softer at 7.80 per cent,
from 8.00 per cent earlier in the week. This was mostly due to a greater
supply of liquidity to the market and the more relaxed nature of dealing at
the start of the month. Three month money was roughly unchanged at 7.55 per
cent.
By contrast, French cash rates dropped sharply as the franc enjoyed a new
bout of strength against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
Three month French francs fell back to 7.40 per cent from a previous close
of 7.60 per cent on the bid side, pushing them below the German level. The
September futures contract closed up 14 basis points on the day at 93.20,
narrowing the spread between September Pibor and Euromark futures to 10
basis points.
Speculation of another base rate cut continued to linger in sterling
markets. In the discount market, dealers were wary of offering bills
outright to the Bank of England for fear of losing any capital gain if
monetary policy is eased.
However, difficulties removing the Pounds 1.5bn shortage forecast by the
Bank pushed the overnight rate up to 9 per cent yesterday, with late
assistance of Pounds 465m. Three-month money closed  1/32 per cent firmer at
5 29/32 per cent.
Sterling futures contracts were more-or-less unchanged on the day, but still
reflected some bullishness about prospective rate cuts. The September
contract closed down 1 basis point at 94.28.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark shows more weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK continued to show signs of weakness inside the European exchange
rate mechanism yesterday as the peseta recovered in the run-up to the
Spanish general election, writes James Blitz.
Last week's run on the Spanish currency was partly triggered by speculation
that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the country's prime minister, would lose this
Sunday's general election.
But following his strong performance on television earlier this week, some
Spanish opinion polls are now putting Mr Gonzalez neck-and-neck with Mr Jose
Maria Aznar, the main opposition leader.
Dealers believe Mr Gonzalez retains a strong commitment to Spain's ERM
membership, and the peseta yesterday rallied to a London close of Pta77.89
against the D-Mark from a previous close of Pta78.24. In the ERM grid, it
jumped one place - to close in second place below the Portuguese escudo.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic policy adviser at Bank of America in London,
believes that the peseta's strength in recent days has been the source of
more D-Mark weakness. 'If the peseta can hold on to these levels, then
tensions in the ERM might die down altogether,' he said.
The Italian lira was one beneficiary of yesterday's weakness in the German
currency, closing at L912.0 from a previous L913.9. The French franc
consolidated its strong run against the German currency this week, closing
unchanged at FFr3.369.
The Swedish krone was also stronger, despite comments from the Swedish bank
governor that the currency was likely to float for some time to come. The
krone was trading last night at around SKr4.4955 to the D-Mark from around
SKr4.5130 at the start of the European day.
Once again, sterling was one of the currencies not to benefit much from
all-round D-Mark weakness, although, for the first time since Mr Kenneth
Clarke was appointed chancellor, the currency did not depreciate on the day.
The pound remains undermined by speculation in money markets that Mr Clarke
will introduce another cut in UK base rates, and closed at DM2.4650, up  1/4
pfennig on the day.
The dollar was also fairly unmoved against the German currency, remaining
range-bound between DM1.5970 and DM1.6030. It later closed in London at
DM1.6005.
One reason for the limited position taking in the dollar was that dealers
were awaiting today's non-farm payroll figure for May, which is expected to
show a net monthly rise in the headline figure of 130,000.
However, some suggested yesterday that even more importance is now being
attached to the producer prices and consumer prices figures in the US which
are not due out until later this month. If these figures show unexpected
rises in inflation, the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US threatens to escalate trade
dispute over apples
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN faced increasing pressure yesterday to lift its 22-year-old ban on US
apples as Senator Slade Gorton of Washington state, speaking at a news
conference in Tokyo, warned that Japan's refusal to allow imports of the
fruit was a potential violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Japan's apple market was officially liberalised in 1971 but has remained
closed through strict quarantine rules over pests and diseases. The Japanese
maintain that the matter is purely technical but the US is now poised to
treat it as a symbol of unfair trade practices by threatening to escalate
the squabble into a political issue. Last month, Mr Mike Espy, US
agriculture secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, wrote
to Japan's agriculture minister, warning that continuing the ban on US
apples would 'exacerbate trade tensions' between the two countries.
The US is demanding that the apple market be opened by next January, and
wants Japanese inspectors to be dispatched to Washington to confirm
fumigation treatments.
The US frustration stems from years of trying to meeting Japanese
requirements for controlling the codling moth pest and fireblight disease.
The Japanese have recently raised concern over another pest, the lesser
apple worm.
Japan's recent agreement with New Zealand to import apples starting this
month has also added to the tension. US trade negotiators point out that New
Zealand was given priority treatment because its apple crop was a tenth the
size of the US's and its growing season was the opposite of Japan's.
In their turn, Japanese agricultural ministry officials have pointed out
that citrus-producing states in the US have yet to accept imports of
Japanese mandarin oranges.
However, Mr Tom Hale, president of the Washington Apple Commission, which
represents growers producing 60 per cent of the US apple crop, contended:
'It still means that 75 per cent of America's population can eat Japan's
mandarins. We wouldn't complain if 75 per cent of the Japanese apple market
was open to us'.

plea for flea

THE NEW Zealand govern-ment yesterday refused to bow to demands from farmers
to introduce the myxomatosis flea. The farmers say the flea is needed to
kill millions of rabbits which are devastating parts of the South Island's
alpine country, but the government argues that it might endanger the native
bird, the kiwi.
Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, said it was possible that the
myxomatosis flea would also attack the kiwi, the flightless bird that is New
Zealand's national symbol. 'And I don't want that on my conscience,' he
said.
It had been a difficult decision, he said, and he knew it would enrage South
Island farmers. 'But we simply could not guarantee that there was no risk to
the kiwi.'
'It is known that unlike other birds, the kiwi has the same body temperature
as the rabbit, and parts of body are covered with hair-like feathers that
are very similar to rabbit fur.'
Mr Falloon promised that the government would spend an additional NZDollars
1.3m (Pounds 460,000) on the search for other ways to to cope with the
exploding rabbit population and with the high cost of alternative pest
control measures.
Rabbits are causing multi-million-dollar losses to South Island high country
farmers through erosion.

US budget pass
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration agreed to an expansion of US sugar and peanut
quotas in a deal to get the support of Democratic congressmen for the
president's budget package.
The economic package only barely passed, squeaking by with a 219-213 vote.
As a result of the deal, the US will reclassify products made mostly of
sugar, imported from Canada under the bilateral free trade agreement and
included in the quota for sugar-containing products. A similar process will
apply to peanut paste.
Mr Don Parrish, an American Farm Bureau official, said the farm lobby has
urged the 'reclassification' because Canadian companies were circumventing
rules of origin as well as the established quota on sugar-containing
products.
The value of the sugar in the reclassified products could be as much as
USDollars 84m.
US farm groups say the expansion of the quota to other products will help
stabilise US sugar prices, which are maintained by a tariff rate quota. They
say the peanut paste exported by Canada is mostly made from imported peanuts
through a process that does not transform the product enough for it to count
as Canadian.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market nervous as copper surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WAVE of nervousness surged through the copper market yesterday as traders
who had been gambling that the price had further to fall decided to scramble
for cover.
Copper for delivery in three months crashed conclusively through the
psychologically important USDollars 1,850-a-tonne level on the London Metal
Exchange, touching Dollars 1,875 at one stage. Profit-taking caused it to
ease back and close at Dollars 1,865, up Dollars 52 or nearly 3 per cent
from Wednesday's close.
The traders' nervousness, also noticeable on the New York Commodity
Exchange, was triggered by the possibility of disruptions at some of the
world's biggest copper mines, suggested Mr William Adams, an analyst at
Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group. In the US,
present labour contracts at Phelps Dodge's Chino mine, Asarco's Ray mine and
RTZ's Bingham Canyon all end this month. In Chile, unions at Chuquicamata,
the world's biggest copper mine, late on Wednesday rejected the first offer
of a new two-year contract from management at state-owned Codelco.
The price of copper collapsed in April, falling by about one quarter from
Dollars 2,200 to Dollars 1,710 a tonne, its lowest level for 5 1/2 years.
Analysts said copper's price had been defying gravity for more than a year
and had not been reflecting the widespread recession in some of the world's
biggest industrial markets.
However, executives from Asarco and Phelps Dodge, in London to talk to
institutional investors this week, are reporting a very sharp increase in
copper demand in the US, which is far outweighing the downturn in Europe.
Demand in Japan remains flat.
Mr Adams suggested that the next technical barrier to copper's upward move
was to Dollars 1,885 a tonne, then to Dollars 1,920.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians reject plan to
liberalise coal prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government was yesterday unable to agree to proposals to
liberalise low domestic prices for coal, but said it would press ahead with
plans to reduce import subsidies on other commodities to defend its own
producers and cut the budget deficit.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said that given opposition to his
proposals to free coal prices and cut big subsidies to coal miners, 'we are
now looking at a compromise to have one big price increase and then slowly
increase prices every month'.
He described as 'crazy' a proposal by the state price committee, which he
oversees, to levy a tax on other industries to help subsidise the coal
industry and another similar tax sought by the agriculture ministry to
support agriculture.
Mr Fyodorov said the cabinet decided to reform the price committee so that
it would start fighting unfair pricing practices and deal with forecasting
rather than coming up with price-regulating schemes that were 'incompatible
with a market economy'.
Having recently declared that import subsidies would be cut by 40 per cent,
Mr Fyodorov said yesterday the idea was to abolish subsidised exchange rates
that encouraged state organisations to import grain, sugar and metals
instead of buying them inside Russia.
He did not spell out which import subsidies would be cut, not least because
he is still struggling with other ministries to get the plan implemented.
But the subsidies would be maintained on critical goods that were not
produced in Russia in sufficient quantities, such as medicines.

Encouraged by the new-found strength of copper prices (see story above) the
London Metal Exchange ZINC market yesterday made a further attempt to erode
resistance above Dollars 950 a tonne for three months metal. But dealers
said it ran out of momentum at Dollars 957 before closing Dollars 6 up on
the day at Dollars 955.50 a tonne. 'If copper falls back I can't see zinc at
these levels for long,' one trader said. LEAD prices recovered some more of
their losses as recognition that recent production cuts had limited the
downside for the metal sparked a bout of short-covering. The three months
delivery price closed at Pounds 271.25 a tonne, up Pounds 3.75. The NICKEL
market was also firmer, with the three months price breaking resistance
above Dollars 5,700 to close at Dollars 5,826.50 a tonne, up Dollars 121 on
the day. In after-hours trading, however, it slipped back to Dollars 5,805.
In the GOLD market this week's retracement from recent highs was halted by
persistent buying, believed to emanate from continental Europe. The London
price closed at Dollars 373.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3. PLATINUM relied
on spill-over buying from gold as it rose Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 387.5 an
ounce at the afternoon price fixing.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Rates cuts setback prompts switching from
bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was again the focus of attention in the European government bond
markets as the Bundesbank Council dashed hopes of an interest rate cut at
its regular meeting yesterday.
The news was compounded by disappointing economic data and technical factors
in bund futures.
The bund futures contract had risen previously on hopes that the German
central bank would cut its key interest rates, even though many economists
had pointed out that there was little justification for an easing.
The release of a worse-than-expected gross national product figure - GNP
fell 3.7 per cent year-on-year - undermined the D-Mark, reducing the chance
of an interest rate cut, dealers said.
When it was announced that the Lombard and discount rates were unchanged,
bund futures rose. One economist said: 'There are buyers lurking at the
lower levels.'
Although domestic buyers moved in when bond yields hit 6.9 per cent, the
buying was offset by heavy selling from non-domestic investors responding to
the weaker currency.
Much of the activity in the futures market was prompted by investors rolling
over their contracts from June, which expires next week, to September, which
is expected to become the front month shortly.
The September contract saw turnover of more than 54,000 contracts, its
heaviest volume so far. It rose three basis points to 94.47, while the June
contract fell 0.11 to 94.02.
Dealers said there was heavy switching out of German bonds into other
European bonds.
SPAIN was an active market on the back of a well-received bond auction. The
central bank issued Pta627bn of three-year, five-year and 10-year stock at
slightly lower yields, and the auction was covered 2.06 times with investors
particularly keen on the longer-dated issues.
Ten-year bond futures moved ahead 35 basis points to 88.53, and the 10-year
cash bond gained half a percentage point.
FRENCH government bonds opened stronger, helped by buying at the short end
and reassured by the franc's firm tone against the D-Mark. However, there
was some pressure from the FFr20.5bn auction of OATS. The June futures
contract on the Matif rose 6 basis points to 116.82.
UK gilts held steady, still supported at the short end by expectations of an
eventual trimming of interest ates.
Analysts said there were more people looking for an early base rate cut than
last week, but they felt the Bank of England had signalled in its open
market operations that it wanted no change in policy.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly at both ends of the market as dealers and
investors cautiously awaited today's May employment report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.856 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
 1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.125 per cent. Trading activity was reported
by dealers to be light.
Prices received an early lift from the news that claims for state
unemployment insurance rose 5,000 to 344,000 last week. The data provided
the latest evidence that labour conditions remained relatively weak, and
raised hopes that the May employment report, out this morning, will show a
similarly sluggish trend in the jobs market.
The range of analysts forecasts for the data is quite wide, ranging from a
gain in non-farm payrolls of 50,000 to a gain of 125,000. Most analysts
expect the national unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 7 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds were firmer in London on continued speculation
that the official discount rate was about to be cut.
The price rise drove the yield on the benchmark No145 JGB down 4 basis
points to 4.585 per cent. Dealers, however, said the Bank of Japan was
unlikely to act until the release of its key Tankan quarterly report on June
11.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's reviews Dollars 8.7bn
of BT long-term debt
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US-based credit rating agency, has placed the long-term debt of
British Telecom, currently rated AAA, under review for possible downgrade.
The move is in response to the announcement of its strategic alliance with
MCI Communications.
Around Dollars 8.7bn of long-term debt is affected.
Moody's cited the increased business risk involved in taking a 20 per cent
stake in MCI, which sets the stage for a struggle for domination of the
world telecommunications market with AT&amp;T.
However, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based rating agency, has confirmed the
AAA rating of BT and its guaranteed units, British Telecom Finance BV and
British Telecom Finance Inc. The rating affirmation reflects S&amp;P's
expectation that the proceeds from BT's Dollars 1.8bn sale of its 20 per
cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, expected to be realised in
September, and excess cashflow 'will be used quickly to repay additional
debt taken on for this investment'.
The rating agency said: 'Over the longer term, the investment (in MCI) could
further strengthen BT's position in the global telecommunications market,
offsetting competitive pressures . . . . in its domestic market.'
Moody's has lowered its ratings of two Japanese regional banks due to the
deterioration in asset quality and the poor outlook for profitability.
Such concerns have prompted frequent downgradings of Japanese banks since
the boom years in the country's property market and economy waned at the
start of this decade.
Until recently, the country's regional banks have been thought to have had
relatively low exposure to bad loans compared with the larger commercial
banks.
The long-term debt of Bank of Yokohama, which owns Guinness Mahon Holdings,
the UK merchant bank, was lowered to A3 from A1. Moody's said Yokohama's
lending to domestic and overseas property markets remained significant in
relation to its capital. Restructuring costs of Guiness Mahon are also
expected to affect Yokohama's asset quality.
The long-term debt rating of Ashikaga Bank was lowered to A3 from A1 as
Moody's expects unrealised losses in Ashikaga's underperforming assets and
restructuring costs of its non-bank affiliates to drain the bank's financial
resources.
Two of Japan's shinkin banks - or credit associations - announced a merger
yesterday, reflecting an increasingly severe environment for the country's
small regional financial institutions.
Maebashi Shinkin Bank and Kyujo Shinkin Bank, both based in Gunma district,
north of Tokyo, said they would complete the one-for-one merger next
February.
More shinkin banks are expected to follow suit, as the institutions, similar
to credit unions and traditionally reliant on small companies for business,
are under increasing pressure as financial authorities deregulate the
country's financial markets.
Moody's is reviewing the Baa1 senior unsecured rating of Bridgestone, the
Japanese tyre maker, and the Baa2 senior unsecured rating of its subsidiary,
Bridgestone Finance Europe, for a possible upgrade, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
Moody's said the action reflected the completion of Bridgestone's
restructuring plans in the US and Europe.
The rating review would focus on the resulting impact on the tyre maker's
competitiveness in these two markets and its financial performance, the
agency said.
It said the review would consider Bridgestone's ability to improve its
overall margins and to generate sufficient cashflow to reduce debt under the
weak global auto sales outlook.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Italy's plans for Dollars 1.5bn issue
inspire FRN sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Italy provided the main talking point of the Eurobond market
yesterday as news emerged of its plans to launch a Dollars 1.5bn
floating-rate note, possibly next week.
Italy issued Dollars 500m of five-year bonds and Dollars 300m of 10-year
bonds last month, representing its first sortie in the Eurodollar bond
sector since its credit rating was downgraded. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit rating agency, downgraded the rating on Italy's sovereign long-term
foreign debt from AA plus to AA in March.
The floating-rate note is expected to have a five-year maturity, and the
deal will be managed by Morgan Stanley, with Kidder Peabody, Merrill Lynch
and J. P. Morgan as joint leads.
Dealers noted plenty of activity in the floating-rate note area yesterday.
The People's Construction Bank of China launched a total of Dollars 120m of
FRNs, consisting of Dollars 50m of five-year notes with a coupon of
six-month Libor plus 50 basis points, and Dollars 70m of seven-year notes
carrying a coupon of Libor plus 60 basis points. The notes are expected to
be sold mainly to investors in the Asia-Pacific region, where the deal was
heavily marketed, although some syndicate desks claimed the deal was hard to
place.
Nafinsa, the Mexican government-owned development bank, issued a Dollars
100m collared floating-rate note. Samuel Montagu, lead manager, said the
deal was the first collared FRN to be issued by an LDC borrower, and the
floor and the cap were set relatively high.
The Eurobond market has seen a steady stream of collared FRNs since last
summer, floors set mainly in the range of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and
caps in the range of 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent. Nafinsa's bond has a coupon
of six-month Libor plus 25 basis points, and has set a minimum coupon of 6
5/8 per cent and a maximum of 10 per cent.
The lead manager said the deal was being aimed at two main investor groups -
the traditional LDC investors and collared note investors. Dealers said
investors were attracted by the higher floor and cap, and noted strong
demand from Swiss investors.
The World Bank launched an additional Pounds 150m tranche of its Pounds 200m
bond issue due December 1998. It was rumoured that the deal was swapped into
floating-rate D-Mark to provide the World Bank with funding at 35 basis
points below Libor.
'This is the best borrower in the world, so it is not surprising they can
get very aggressive funding,' said one syndicate head. The existing tranche
was trading at 10 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998, and
the new tranche was launched at 14 basis points above the gilt. The yield
spread tightened to 12 basis points later in the day.
The Republic of Portugal's DM1.5bn, 10-year issue was priced yesterday to
yield 28 basis points over the relevant bund, and traded up from its reoffer
price of 99.80 to 99.90/99.95 by late afternoon.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Singapore group buys Wellington
tower block
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOTEL Grand Central, the Singapore-based group, yesterday announced the
purchase of one of Wellington's largest building complexes as it continues
to buy 'bargain priced buildings' in both Australia and New Zealand.
The company has spent NZDollars 27.20m (USDollars 15.1m) in buying three New
Zealand buildings in recent weeks, all well below official valuation
estimates. After announcing the purchase of Wellington's landmark Plimmer
City Centre for NZDollars 15.75m, the company immediately announced plans to
spend NZDollars 8m upgrading the 31-storey tower block which was the tallest
in the country until 1986.
In 1985, the complex was valued at NZDollars 95m, and the receivers, acting
on behalf of the Bank of New Zealand, turned down an offer of NZ48m for it
in 1990. It includes a 22-storey tower, a hotel and a car park building.
Only two floors of the office tower are occupied.
Hotel Grand Central owns hotels in Singapore and Malaysia and other office
blocks in north Sydney.
Last week, Hotel Grand Central announced the purchase of the 10-storey DB
Towers Building in Auckland for NZDollars 7.1m.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Regulators struggle to control a
wild market - Thailand's attempts to enforce rules on its stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves by the Stock Exchange of Thailand to introduce more rigorous rules for
disclosure of information by listed companies are being criticised by
stockbrokers as clumsy and unrealistic.
The exchange sent an awkwardly-worded 17-page document to listed companies
requiring that all significant information be 'disclosed to general
investors, and not to a specific group of people'.
It did not consult them in advance, and it did not send copies of the new
rules to stockbroking firms.
Although the thrust of rules appeared uncontroversial, requiring timely
release of important information and barring companies from passing
privileged information, some brokers said they were a triumph of form over
substance in a market were many company controllers still believed they
could do what they wished.
Brokers are upset by private hints from listed companies that they may be
forced to be less forthcoming under the new regime, and that therefore it
was likely to do little to lessen insider trading. The irritation of
international brokers was all the greater because of the absence of official
English language copies of the rules.
Mr Peter Schiefelbein, chief representative for Standard Chartered
Securities Asia, said: 'The regulators have tried very hard but they lack
the experience of western authorities who pursue the principle but realise
the practical. It is bad to make rules that cannot or will not be enforced.
'The speed they are going and the extent to which they are adopting
unrealistic approaches is a little bit worrying. It is not easy to turn back
 -how do you relax disclosure rules? - yet it would be a tragedy if they end
up with the stifling Singaporean situation.'
Mr George Morgan, country manager for HG Asia Investment Research, said:
'It's bizarre. It will make it harder for people who are not insiders to get
information about a company. Foreign investors who already have doubts about
quality of information will not be impressed.'
Mr Russell Kopp, a senior analyst at Baring Research, said: 'The regulators
have to move a little slower. Grand concepts are fine but the reality is
this market has been pretty wild for a very long time - many still think
'until I'm caught its not illegal''. He said rules about timely release of
important corporate information without either definition or legal precedent
were 'just a joke'.
Stock exchange officials said they were mystified by suggestions that
analysts would have reduced access to information.
Mr Chaipat Sahasakul, senior vice-president said the exchange 'has a policy
of full disclosure. Our intention is that companies give out more, not less.
We just want to make sure they use price sensitive information in a proper
manner'. The controversy followed another attempt by the Thai authorities to
crack down on stock-market irregularities, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission asked in April for the prosecution of 30 investors suspected of
rigging share prices.
Hardly had the investors had a chance to contemplate the biggest legal
action in the market's history when the names of 123 more suspects were
leaked to the local press.
Police investigations into 30 cases continued, and prosecutions against some
are expected. No legal proceedings are expected against the 123 people whose
names were leaked.
Investors whose nerves had been frayed by earlier round-ups of suspected
market manipulators suddenly had to contend with rumours about how far the
regulators might go. The index plunged 6.2 per cent in five days - it has
since fallen a further 1.6 per cent.
The leak cast a shadow over what should have been a success for the
commission. The naming of the 30 people was the culmination of seven months
of action against four groups suspected of being big-time share
manipulators.
Mr Ekkamol Kiriwat, the commission's secretary-general said tough action had
been inevitable. 'We were in a dilemma: everybody knew the market was being
manipulated - it was discussed openly in the newspapers. You cannot have a
perfect level playing field but it must be respectable or how can we ask
anyone to invest?'
Mr Schiefelbein said the authorities may have been too ambitious. 'In an
emerging market the most important thing is for a company to be able to
raise money through equities without resorting to debt. I think the Thai
market could have handled being a cowboy one for a few more years,' he said.
However, Mr Francis Middlehurst, head of research for Crosby Research
(Thailand), was more generous. 'Considering the market was regularly ramped
and manipulated by some extraordinarily powerful and well-connected people I
think (the SEC) got a good result. If the exchange has also found it
difficult to write insider trading rules then I'm not surprised - it's very
difficult. It is part of the maturing process.'
The Thai market has grown in the past five years. The number of listed
companies has risen to 323 this month from 141 at the end of 1988, with
market capitalisation climbing to nearly Dollars 60bn from Dollars 9bn in
1988. But the prevalence of unusual price movements was underlined recently
when a number of shares showed unusual life shortly before first-quarter
results.
However, analysts believe that once teething troubles have been overcome,
Thailand's cleaner stock market will become a more attractive destination
for investment.

THE Reserve Bank of New Zealand plans to introduce tough disclosure
requirements on registered banks.
Mr Don Brash, Reserve Bank governor, announcing proposed changes, said they
were designed to strengthen disclosure requirements and shift the emphasis
towards more market scrutiny of the banking sector through greater public
disclosure.
They were intended to move the central bank away from more direct
supervision of the trading - or clearing - banks towards a monitoring role
and enforcing the disclosure requirements.
The Reserve Bank is proposing that the banks should disclose their financial
positions every three months and they should provide full audited
disclosures every six months.
This would be to ensure that both the bank and the public were aware of any
changes in their security ratios.
Each bank would be required to display its credit rating in its retail
branches.
The minimum capital adequacy requirements under the Basle Agreement would be
retained and possibly raised, though risk weightings of certain asset
classes could be relaxed or abolished, Mr Brash said. The central bank
wanted to avoid any suggestion that either it, or the government, was
underwriting individual banks or their liabilities through the new regime.
Mr Brash said he expected that the revised requirements would become law by
the middle of next year after further consultations with the banks. The
Reserve Bank had a responsibility to promote public confidence in the
banking system by ensuring adequate financial disclosure, outlining audit
requirements and enhancing the role of credit ratings.
He added that the supervisory role of the central bank was limited because
all but two of New Zealand's 21 banks were foreign-owned.
'Given high foreign ownership in New Zealand, no system of banking
supervision in New Zealand will make a huge difference to the risk of bank
failure,' Mr Brash said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENI, the Italian state energy holding group, swung to a consolidated net
loss of L815bn (Dollars 558m) in 1992 from a net profit of L1,081bn in 1991,
agencies report from Milan.
The losses came despite forecasts by Mr Franco Bernabe, ENI's managing
director, in January that the group would show a profit.
Gross operating profit edged up by 4 per cent, to L9,870bn from L9,510bn, on
revenues down 2 per cent to L49,780bn from L50,880bn.
Financing and exchange rate costs amounted to L2,500bn, up from L2,000bn in
1991, while there were extraordinary losses of L1,400bn against L54bn of
profits in the previous year.
ENI said its basic industrial activities produced a profit of L1,250bn while
the energy sector generated a profit of L3,500bn. But losses from its
non-core businesses, mainly chemicals, had risen to L2,065bn from L1,165bn
in 1991.
ENI described the situation in the chemicals sector as 'very grave'.
Resolving the crisis required selling off businesses in which the group
could no longer invest, and the closing or restructuring of activities in
loss, it said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Power Corporation lets its money
do the talking - Recent deals give few clues to the group's long-term
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER Corporation of Canada's annual meeting last month demonstrated once
again why the Montreal-based financial services and media group has gained a
reputation for speaking softly but wielding a big stick.
Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman and controlling shareholder, gave no hint of
Power's business plans, beyond reaffirming the 'steady, patient and prudent
approach that we always seek to follow'.
But he spoke freely about Power's financial muscle, confirming it had access
to as much as CDollars 2.5bn (USDollars 1.9bn) in cash, and proudly noting
the 'very strong balance sheets and credit ratings' of its affiliates. Power
has no long-term debt, and earned CDollars 152m in 1992 on consolidated
revenues of CDollars 6.1bn.
Observers are left to guess what long-term strategy, if any, lies behind
three recent deals which have cemented Power's foothold in international
communications:
Power has invested Dollars 99m in a 1 per cent stake in Time Warner, the US
media and entertainment group. The holding was revealed last week by
Seagram, the drinks company which has bought a 5.7 per cent interest in Time
Warner. Seagram and Power have several directors in common, but have
insisted their purchases took place independently.
Two months earlier, Power spent CDollars 180m on a 19 per cent interest in
Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper publisher. It has joint control with
Hollinger, the holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of
the UK Telegraph group.
Power Broadcasting, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has formed a partnership with
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to provide two channels to DirecTV,
the planned US direct-broadcast satellite service nicknamed 'Death Star'.
All three transactions bear the stamp of Mr Desmarais' son Andre, who is in
charge of Power's communications business. He is widely recognised as the
more forceful of the two Desmarais sons who help run Power. Andre is said to
have favoured buying a much bigger stake in Time Warner last year, but to
have been restrained by his father.
Beyond his involvement, the common thread between the three deals is not yet
clear.
Power, which already owns La Presse, Canada's second-biggest French-language
daily, has long viewed loss-making Southam as one of North America's
worst-managed newspaper publishers.
'I think they'll start by collaborating closely with Hollinger and the
Southam board to turn Southam around,' says Mr Stephen Jarislowsky, a
Southam director who is also president of Jarislowsky Fraser, Canada's
biggest pension fund portfolio manager. In the longer run, analysts are
speculating that Power, Southam and Hollinger may pool their North American
media interests.
The new investments have given Power a more even balance between its stakes
in communications and financial services, and between its European and North
American interests.
The Desmarais' attention over the past decade has been focused on Pargesa,
the Geneva-based investment holding company, which Power controls jointly
with Mr Albert Frere, the Belgian financier.
Pargesa is emerging from an unsettled period, during which it has shed a
stake in Henry Ansbacher, the London merchant bank; has been assured of
control of Petrofina, the Belgian energy group; and (most recently) has
acquired a minority stake in CarnaudMetalbox, Europe's biggest metal
packaging company. Pargesa has also given Power a window on the European
communications business through ownership of Radio-Television Luxembourg.
RTL owns 10 radio stations and six TV channels, beaming into France, Germany
and the Benelux countries.
Mr Paul Desmarais, 66, began his business career by reviving small-town bus
operators in Ontario and Quebec. He bought control of Power Corporation in
1968. He has built a reputation as a canny investor, usually buying and
selling at the right time. Mr Desmarais has disposed of every one of the
shipping, forestry and financial-service companies which Power controlled
when he took over 25 years ago.
Stakes in Consolidated-Bathurst (now Stone-Consolidated), the Quebec-based
forestry group, and in Montreal Trust, a mid-sized financial-services
company, were unloaded just before the onset of the last recession.
Mr Desmarais has impeccable business and political connections in and
outside Canada. Former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau and the present
incumbent, Mr Brian Mulroney, have several times used the helicopter pad at
the Desmarais summer home at La Malbaie, Quebec.
Nonetheless, Mr Desmarais' advances have been rebuffed on several occasions.
During the 1970s, he failed to transform a 10 per cent stake in Argus Corp,
one of English Canada's most blue-blooded companies, into anything more
significant. Political pressure forced him to back away in the early 1980s
from an attempt to gain control of Canadian Pacific, another pillar of the
business establishment.
Mr Andre Desmarais told the annual meeting that Power is restricting its
investments to friendly, high-quality targets 'where we can participate as
shareholders, and where we can work in a constructive way with management'.
If it remains true to those criteria, Power must at least be considering a
bigger stake in Time Warner than that which it now holds.

MAGNA International, the biggest independent Canadian car parts producer,
recorded a 46 per cent jump in third-quarter profit. The group added that it
would be debt-free by July 31.
Net profit was CDollars 44.4m (USDollars 34.9m), or CDollars 1 a share,
against CDollars 30.5m, or 89 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced 13
per cent to CDollars 742m.
Profits for the nine-month period rose 51 per cent to CDollars 101m, or
CDollars 2.34, from CDollars 66.7m, or CDollars 2.13, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 13 per cent to CDollars 2bn.
Magna, with plants in Canada, the US and Europe, is benefiting from stronger
North American vehicle production. Its gross margin was 19.5 per cent in the
third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the second, but the group warned
that customer pricing pressures were increasing.
The fourth quarter, normally the weakest, should be buoyed by the North
American recovery and the big assemblers' shift to outsourcing of parts.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's monopoly telephone company,
fell sharply in New York and Mexico yesterday as investors reacted to a
veiled profits warning from the company's finance director, Mr Adolfo
Cerezo.
After falling at one point by more than Dollars 2, Telmex's New York-listed
American Depositary Receipts closed at Dollars 46 1/4 , down Dollars 1 1/2 .
The Mexican stock market was pulled down by Telmex, the exchange's largest
stock.
Mr Cerezo told investors at a conference organised by the brokerage Smith
Barney that 'the second quarter is not going to be easier than the first
quarter'. He added that Telmex would not buy back a chunk of its shares as
it had previously announced, because it had been unable to obtain a suitable
price.
First-quarter results were affected by slow growth in the Mexican economy,
with revenues and traffic growth lower than analysts had expected. Mr Cerezo
said Telmex would continue to suffer from low growth in the second quarter.
Trading in Telmex shares is generally higher in New York than in Mexico
City. This makes the company particularly vulnerable to the perceptions of
US investors, who tend to be more short-term oriented than their Mexican
counterparts.
Analysts expressed surprise at Thursday's fall in Telmex stock, since Mr
Cerezo's comments were made early Wednesday morning.
'The reaction is overdone,' said Mr Jorge Suarez of Nomura Research. 'I'm
very surprised that news about the second quarter is having an impact now.'
Mr Suarez said he understood that fund managers who were not present at the
Smith Barney conference had sold Telmex stock on reports of Mr Cerezo's
comments. Another broker described the fall as 'retail-led panic'.

MR Tom Oliver, head of worldwide customer operations at Federal Express and
the effective 'number two' executive at the nation's largest overnight
delivery company, has resigned.
Mr Oliver said he was taking up the post of chief executive and president of
VoiceCom Systems, a San Francisco-based voice processing services provider.
Also leaving Memphis-based Federal Express is Ms Carole Presley, senior
vice-president for marketing and corporate communications. She will remain a
consultant to FedEx but will start her own consulting business in Florida.
Federal Express has suffered problems in its international division and was
forced to retrench from an ambitious European expansion plan last year.
Since then, losses on the international front have been diminishing,
although competition has put pressure on domestic earnings.
Mr Oliver, 52, who had headed the international business, became executive
vice-president of worldwide customer operations in 1991. He oversaw much of
the European restructuring.
FedEx said Mr Oliver would be replaced by Mr William Razzouk, currently
senior vice-president of sales and customer service.

CANADIAN Airlines Inter-national is offering CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.7m)
cash and CDollars 1.5m in transition costs to leave the Gemini reservations
system it now jointly owns with rival Air Canada and a smaller airline.
Canadian must switch from Gemini to American Airlines' Sabre system as part
of a deal in which American would invest CDollars 246m in Canadian for a 25
per cent voting stake.
The National Transportation Agency has cleared the equity infusion and
Canadian's exit from Gemini is the only remaining hurdle for Canadian's deal
with American.
However, Air Canada is appealing the NTA approval for the federal cabinet,
saying both Canadian airlines should be merged. It continues to hold
Canadian to its original Gemini agreement, and has taken the issue to the
courts.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian and its parent PWA, said agreement on
its exit from Gemini should be reached on a commercial basis and he himself
was ready to negotiate a solution directly with Mr Hollis Harris, chairman
of Air Canada, to finalise details.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Lower loan-loss provisions lift
results at CIBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce benefited from stronger fee income and
lower loan-loss provisions in the second quarter of fiscal 1993.
The bank, Canada's second biggest, reported earnings of CDollars 180m
(USDollars 142m), or 75 cents a share, in the three months to April 30,
compared with a CDollars 440m loss, or CDollars 2.54 a share, a year
earlier. Return on equity in the latest period was 10.8 per cent.
Last year's heavy loss was caused by loan writedowns totalling CDollars
1.19bn, largely reflecting CIBC's exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the crippled
real estate developer.
Loan-loss provisions in the latest quarter were CDollars 220m, indicating an
unchanged estimate of loan losses for the year of CDollars 880m.
Like most of the other Canadian banks which have reported over the past 10
days, CIBC noted a modest improvement in its loan portfolio.
Non-performing loans fell to just under CDollars 3bn on April 30, from
CDollars 3.14bn three months earlier.
The bank attributed a 21 per cent jump in non-interest income from the
previous quarter to strong earnings from underwriting and brokerage
activities, as well as higher foreign exchange and swaps income.
Non-interest income rose by 4 per cent over the year.
Assets stood at CDollars 137.9bn on April 30, up CDollars 1.7bn from a year
earlier. Thanks to several common and preferred share issues, the bank has
boosted its total capital-to-assets ratio from 8.7 per cent to 9.7 per cent
over the past six months.
CIBC is the last of the Big Six Canadian banks to report second-quarter
earnings.
Although the banks continue to experience problems with their commercial
property portfolios, the results point to a gradual improvement in earnings
and shareholder returns.
Most of the banks are actively expanding their fiduciary and insurance
interests to take advantage of financial-service reforms legislated last
year.
The securities businesses which the banks acquired after similar reforms
were introduced in 1987 have been significant generators of profit in recent
quarters.

<TEXT>
AIR CANADA is appealing against the National Transportation Agency's
approval of American Airlines' plan to pump CDollars 246m (USDollars 193m)
of equity into ailing Canadian Airlines International in exchange for a 25
per cent voting stake and close operational links.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chairman, said he was taking his appeal to
the Federal Cabinet because of doubts over whether Canada could sustain two
international airlines.
He maintained that if the two airlines were consolidated, they could create
'a strong independent carrier taking a leadership role in the world airline
industry'.
Canadian can still not consummate the deal with American because it is
locked into a joint reservation system with Air Canada. It is now trying to
negotiate its way out of this.

SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday reported
a sharp rise in pre-tax profits in the first four months of this year to
NKr640m (Dollars 61m) from NKr269m, helped by higher crude oil prices and
increased production.
The result was better than analysts' forecasts and Saga shares improved.
Revenues rose to NKr2.08bn from NKr1.64bn. Operating profit increased to
NKr658m from NKr378m and net profits more than doubled to NKr209m.
Saga obtained an average sales price of NKr128 per barrel of oil in the four
months, against NKr115. Oil sales rose to 10m barrels from 8.3m. Total
production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids increased to 1.7m tonnes of
oil equivalent, from 1.4m.
Saga said the improved result was also helped by the reversal of a NKr119m
unrealised currency loss, in connection with the group's long-term dollar
loans.
Net financial expenses were reduced to NKr18m from NKr109m.

<TEXT>
PLZENSKE Pivovary, the Czech brewer which makes Pilsner Urquell beer, said
yesterday that it would shortly announce a strategy for modernisation and
marketing along with financing plans.
Mr Mario Junek, chief financial officer, said Plzen had invested heavily to
raise production capacity over the past three years to compete with European
breweries, but it had been hit by delays in completing its privatisation,
and declining export sales.
Mr Junek firmly denied reports that the company was facing bankruptcy.
'We have made large investments to improve technology and quality. Now we
are waiting for a decision on (completing) privatisation.
'We have many possibilities to finance our modernisation. It would be no
problem raising money on the international capital markets,' Mr Junek said.
The company was 67 per cent privatised last year in the first wave of
voucher privatisation, with the bulk of the shares being taken by investment
funds.
Prazdroj, the largest of Plzen's four breweries, was not included in the
privatisation.
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, has said it is interested in co-operation with
the Czech brewer.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Satisfactory solution to
Procordia wrangle - The resolution of the dispute between the government and
Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's long-serving chairman, was showing something
of his old jaunty self-confidence yesterday as he sat wreathed in smiles
alongside Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish Prime Minister, for the announcement
that the government and Volvo had finally resolved their wrangle over
Procordia, the big food and pharmaceuticals group.
The past 18 months have been tricky for PG, as Mr Gyllenhammar is widely
known in Sweden. Volvo, a few years ago one of the world's most profitable
vehicle makers, has become bogged down in heavy losses, forcing it to close
plants Mr Gyllenhammar designed as model workplaces; last year, Mr Bildt's
conservative-led government blocked Mr Gyllenhammar's attempt to merge Volvo
and Procordia as a way to help Volvo out of its troubles; finally, in April,
PG suffered the indignity of having to disclose his salary and benefits as a
result of pressure from small shareholders restive over his autocratic rule
of the company.
Now, the Procordia issue at least has turned out more or less as Mr
Gyllenhammar originally intended.
In early 1992, Mr Gyllenhammar proposed a merger with Procordia by way of a
reverse takeover of Volvo, which at the time held 39.5 per cent of the food
and drugs group's equity and 42.7 per cent of its voting rights.
But the government, then with 34.2 per cent of the equity but also with 42.7
per cent of voting rights objected, saying, in effect, that its
privatisation plans did not include handing over prime goods at knock-down
prices to the country's largest manufacturer.
Mr Gyllenhammar's strategy of building a new conglomerate in which a
weakened Volvo acquired an additional profitable pillar outside the motor
industry was thrown into doubt, and was little clarified by a later holding
agreement with the government allowing Volvo to remain the largest
shareholder in Procordia.
Yesterday's deal, in which Volvo will become the 100 per cent owner of
Procordia's food and consumer products business, looks to have put the
strategy largely back on track. The wholly-owned chunk of Procordia will add
SKr25bn (Dollars 3.48bn) in annual turnover - expanding Volvo's group
turnover by about one third. More important, it will contribute about SKr2bn
in profits and SKr1bn or more in cash flow to beleaguered Volvo, which
showed a SKr331m loss in the first quarter.
On the face of it, Volvo has given up the chance to take over the
pharmaceutical side of Procordia, with annual profits of around SKr3bn. But
it will almost certainly build up its stake to 35 per cent. Once the
government sells off its stake of around 50 per cent, Volvo will be the
dominant shareholder.
Volvo will have to stump up both for the 26 per cent of the food business
still publicly held and for any additions to its 25 per cent stake in the
drugs side. But, as Mr Gyllenhammar acknowledged yesterday, Volvo in its
present weakened state could not have afforded a straight takeover of
Procordia.
Questions may well still be asked about the overall strategy of diversifying
into Procordia - not least by Renault, Volvo's vehicle-making partner. But
Mr Gyllenhammar can at least argue that the direction is once again clear.
'Volvo is going to be a company with two important elements,' he said
yesterday. 'By far the biggest one is to be an industrial partner in one of
the biggest automotive combinations in Europe, and the other is to have a
non-cyclical business that will be stable and give continuous cash flow to
the parent company.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: SMH shrugs off recession as
profits rise by 64%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMH, the group that rescued the Swiss watch industry in the early 1980s,
continues to buck the recession, with a 64 per cent rise in 1992 net profit
to SFr413m (Dollars 290m), higher dividends and a forecast of further brisk
growth.
'We hope that we shall record a considerable increase in profit and sales
this year,' Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman, told the group's annual press
conference yesterday.
Mr Hayek pointed out that the group was planning for sales to double over
the next five years to SFr5.5bn.
SMH is best known for its Swatch watches, but it also makes several other
famous brands - including Blancpain, Omega, Longines, Tissot and Rado - and
is an important supplier of watch components for third parties. It has begun
making a line of Swatch telephones and is developing an
environmentally-friendly Swatch car.
The car project suffered a setback in January when SMH's partner,
Volkswagen, withdrew. Mr Hayek said SMH was continuing to negotiate with
other potential partners. The project was absorbing only about 5 per cent of
SMH's investment budget, he said.
Mr Hayek said last year was 'the best ever' for the world watch industry,
with production up 4 per cent to 860m units. SMH's sales surged 12 per cent
to 86.9m units.
This year, in spite of dull economic conditions in many key markets, 'we
have found that our watch sales are still growing', he said. Sales were up
more than 16 per cent in the first four months and profit growth was higher.
He predicted that the group would have net cash balances of SFr1bn by the
end of the year, compared with SFr262m at the end of 1992, but said no
acquisitions were planned.
The directors have proposed a 28.6 per cent rise in dividends for 1992, to
18 per cent of the nominal value of its two classes of shares and
participation certificates.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Cap Gemini blames losses on
overstaffing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAP GEMINI SOGETI, the French-based computing services company in which
Daimler Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, yesterday blamed its 1992
losses on the economic situation coupled with management failures to deal
early enough with overstaffing and sluggish marketing.
Mr Serge Kampf, chairman, said there had been an appreciable decline in the
number of orders produced while across the group there had been delays in
cutting staff numbers to match lower levels of revenue.
Cap Gemini lost FFr72m (Dollars 14m) last year compared with taxable profits
of FFr560m in 1991. Revenues grew 18.5 per cent to FFr11.9bn but the
increase came entirely from acquisitions.
The group is looking for further equity partners, with an emphasis on
telecommunications, and Mr Kampf expressed considerable exasperation over
the failure of the French government to indicate whether France Telecom
would be allowed to take a stake in the company.
The two companies have been talking for more than a year but complications
following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of a 34 per cent stake in Sogeti, the
CGS holding company, had delayed a deal. CGS is Europe's leading computer
services company and fifth in the world rankings.
Mr Kampf said he now believed that no computing services company could
afford to be all things to all clients and that in the future the company
would be selective in its choice of activities.
He was gloomy about the prospects for the current year, saying he could see
no clear signs of a revival in mainland Europe, although there were brighter
indications in the UK where the company owns the computing services group,
Hoskyns.

FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Passenger trend behind KLM's
tumble into red
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines swung into a heavy loss of Fl 562m (Dollars 312m)
last year, due partly to the trend among passengers to choose tourist class
over business and first class as well as to continued losses at Northwest,
the Dutch group's minority-owned US airline.
The loss - for the year ended March - compares with a net profit of Fl 125m
the year before. Passenger traffic rose, but the airline also saw a sharp
increase in demand for cheaper seats, resulting in a 9 per cent decline in
average yields. The guilder's strength and fierce international competition
also lay behind the downturn.
KLM has written down the remaining Fl 438m book value of its Northwest stake
to zero, compared with the Dollars 400m it paid for the shares in 1989. This
accounts for the widening of total losses in associate airlines to Fl 388m
from Fl 145m. The figure would have been higher had it not been for profits
posted by Dutch charter airline Martinair.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president, said: 'This does not however mean that we have
written off Northwest Airlines. Nor that we have waived (our) loans to
Northwest.'
The Dutch airline is to omit its 1992-1993 dividend. In 1991-1992 KLM had
resumed dividends after a one-year hiatus.
KLM planned to redouble efforts to reduce costs and return to profitability,
Mr Bouw said. This will include a reconfiguration of seats in its Boeing 747
fleet to increase the size of tourist class and reduce the availability of
first and business class. Other measures might include taking aircraft out
of service and pruning the route network.
He said he was optimistic about co-operation talks between KLM, SAS,
Swissair and Austrian Airlines. Swissair said yesterday that it and three
other European airlines intended to sign a memorandum of understanding on
their planned alliance at the end of this month.

PROFITS at Kaufhof, the German retailing group, are expected to rise
significantly despite the difficult economic climate in Germany, Mr Jens
Odewald, chief executive, said yesterday.
The group said that it planned to create 7,000 new jobs by 1995, of which
5,000 will be in Germany. Kaufhof said it would add 73 new businesses to its
1,012 branches by the end of the year. European countries other than Germany
account for 20 per cent of the company's sales.
Group sales in the first five months of the year increased by 6.2 per cent
to DM8.2bn (Dollars 5.1bn). For the whole of 1992 sales were DM22.5bn.
Results were boosted by sales in eastern Germany which rose in 1992 by 29
per cent. In comparison, sales in the western part of the country increased
by 7.8 per cent.
Mr Odewald did not comment on the 1993 dividend but said the company's
reserves would be significantly strengthened this year. Kaufhof plans to pay
an unchanged DM12 dividend for 1992.
The company is particularly benefiting from its expansions beyond department
stores where sales fell by 2.2 per cent to DM3.6bn for the first five
months. In contrast, sales in its speciality stores, which include computer
and home entertainment shops, are booming.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Rowlinson 14% ahead to Pounds 0.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER RENTAL income and lower interest costs enabled Rowlinson Securities,
the property company, to report pre-tax profits 14 per cent ahead for the
year to March 31.
On turnover of Pounds 8.96m (Pounds 8.41m) pre-tax profits were Pounds
722,000 (Pounds 631,000). Rental income was Pounds 3.42m (Pounds 3.2m) and
finance charges were Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.84m).
However there was a tax charge of Pounds 143,000 this time against a credit
of Pounds 49,000, leaving earnings per share at 4.64p (5.44p).
The company paid a second interim in lieu of a final in April resulting in a
total payment for the year of 1.5p (1.35p).

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: N Ireland Electricity valued at Pounds 362m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the last of the regional electricity companies
to be privatised, was offered for sale by the government yes-terday with a
price tag of Pounds 362m.
Mr Robert Atkins, minister for the economy and the environment in Northern
Ireland, announced in Belfast that company's 165m shares would be offered at
220p each.
This represents a historic gross dividend yield of 5.8 per cent based on net
dividends for the 1992-93 year of Pounds 16.5m, or 10.02p per share. All the
company's shares are being offered for sale except for a small proportion
for bonus entitlements and employees.
Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first 100p payable on
application and the rest on June 28 1994. The offer, with a 100-share
minimum, closes June 16.
Incentives are being offered for pre-registered applicants who hold on to
their shares for a given period. The offer has attracted more than 800,000
registrations.
COMMENT
The offer price lay at the mid-point of market expectations and was viewed
in the City as providing an attractive investment opportunity. The historic
yield of 5.8 per cent compares with an average in the regional electricity
company sector of 5.1 per cent, pointing to a possible gain of between 10p
and 15p when the shares begin trading on June 21. Analysts were calculating
a prospective yield of well above 6 per cent. All this suggests that
Rothschilds and the government are keen to conclude the massive electricity
privatisation exercise with a triumphant send-off.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Princedale to acquire Hillsdown companies
for maximum Pounds 9.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCEDALE Group, the USM-quoted marketing and design consultancy, plans to
form a new industrial division through the acquisition of Colloids, Hallam
Plastics and Hallmark Contract Hire from Hillsdown Holdings and other
minority holders.
The initial cost is Pounds 7.65m, which may increase to a maximum Pounds
9.15m.
At the same time, Princedale announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 71,000
(Pounds 326,000 profits) for the six months to March 31. Turnover fell to
Pounds 4.47m (Pounds 6.37m) and there were losses per share of 0.01p (0.06p
earnings).
The acquisitions are being funded as to Pounds 3.49m by the issue to the
vendors of new consolidated ordinary shares at 25p per share, Pounds 3.45m
by the issue of 7 per cent fixed secured loan notes, and Pounds 700,000 in
cash.
A placing and open offer of 16m new consolidated ordinary shares,
underwritten by Guinness Mahon, will raise about Pounds 4m, of which Pounds
1.6m is for Princedale.
Princedale's existing ordinary shares will be consolidated on the basis of
one consolidated ordinary share for every 20 existing ordinary shares.
Shareholders may apply under the open offer on the basis of five offer
shares for every eight consolidated ordinary shares resulting from the
capital reorganisation.
Princedale's current account period will run for 15 months.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Export progress for ABI Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REFLECTING progress in export markets, turnover of ABI Leisure Group rose
3.7 per cent to Pounds 29m, compared with Pounds 28.1m, in the half year
ended February 28 1993.
After slightly higher interest charges the profit before tax was marginally
up at Pounds 1.27m, against Pounds 1.25m. Earnings per share were 3.1p (3p).
Mr George Shiels, chairman, said the composition of sales was changing, with
a larger proportion of revenue earned from sales of leisure homes. Other
operations include the manufacture of touring caravans.
At the end of the period stocks of completed caravans were at the lowest
levels consistent with adequately servicing the dealer network.
Dividend policy is to pay one-third as an interim and the balance as the
final. An interim of 1.25p (1.57p) is declared, with an unchanged total of
3.76p forecast.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: T&amp;N raises Pounds 37m for purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the motor component manufacturer, yesterday successfully placed 21.9m
shares at 170p to raise Pounds 37m to help finance the acquisition of Goetze
AG, the German piston ring producer.
The deal, announced in principle last year, will cost DM250m (Pounds 102m).
The first DM90m instalment was made yesterday, the second DM90m is due next
March with a final DM70m due in March 1995.
T&amp;N's share price rose 7p to 184p yesterday amid enthusiasm for the deal
among institutional investors.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said he was not too concerned
that the German economy appeared to be heading more rapidly into recession
than was anticipated last December.
'We envisaged significant cost reductions and restructuring so our forward
projections were based on a lower volume than business was operating on
historically,' he said. The group was assuming that the German economy would
be improving by 1995. It thought German car production would fall 15 per
cent this year. It appears to be 20 per cent down.
Goetze, which is privately owned, is the largest producer in Europe of
piston rings for supply to vehicle makers as original equipment. It also
produces gaskets and has an important manufacturing presence in the US.
It has six plants in Germany and five in the US, as well as others in France
and Turkey.
Mr Hope said the group had been hoping to do a vendor placing but tax
problems and complexities arising from the family shareholdings made this
difficult. The placing means T&amp;N will be restricted from making further
placings for a year.
T&amp;N said yesterday that Goetze would have significant strategic benefits for
the group and would strengthen its position as a supplier of components to
original equipment manufacturers.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bett Bros Pounds 0.5m back in profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BETT BROS, the property investment and development group, returned to profit
for the half year ended February 28 and resumed dividends after a one-year
absence.
Pre - tax profit was Pounds 551,000 and an interim dividend of 0.5p is being
paid from earnings of 3.7p. That contained a contribution at the operating
level from each activity - housing, property and Bett Inns, the pubs and
hotels division.
Bett was currently trading in line with expectations, the directors said.
Further progress was expected in the second half.
In the comparative half year the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
9.93m, equal to 66.2p per share. The deficit was reduced to Pounds 4.22m by
the financial year-end.
The directors said they were sufficiently confident that problems associated
with certain of its south of England property developments were under
control, although not yet completely resolved.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Associates boost for Rowe Evans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUATION of firm palm oil prices and increasing crops from its
Indonesian estates, helped profits at Rowe Evans Investments advance from
Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 6.08m pre-tax in 1992.
The result was boosted by a Pounds 3.4m contribution from associates,
because of their better trading results, a land disposal by Bertam Holdings
and the sale of a Malaysian estate-owning subsidiary by Lendu Holdings.
Turnover improved to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.93m) while trading profits
advanced from Pounds 938,000 to Pounds 2.42m.
Earnings per share worked through at 9.63p, compared with 2.71p, and the
proposed final dividend is being doubled to 2p.
The company said that 1993 oil palm crops were expected to show a marked
increase over 1992 levels.

<TEXT>
BERTAM HOLDINGS, which is involved in oil and rubber plantations and
property development in Malaysia, announced a jump in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 7.17m for 1992.
The result included an exceptional gain of Pounds 5.63m (Pounds 873,000)
from land sales, mainly of 810 hectares from Bertam Estate to Bertam
Properties, the 40 per cent held joint venture.
Average palm oil prices had been higher than in 1991, while the rubber
market had remained lacklustre. In early 1993 palm oil prices had
strengthened but had recently fallen back to below 1992 levels.
Turnover was Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 1.24m). Earnings rose to 31.54p (7.47p)
and an unch-anged final dividend of 2.5p is proposed, which together with
the special 2.5p interim makes 5p (2.5p) for the year.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Launch of a guarded defence - The Pounds
59m bid by Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST hostile bid by Rentokil, the fast growing environmental and
property services company, has so far been anything but.
The Pounds 59.2m cash offer for Securiguard, the guarding and cleaning
company, was launched last month at a low-key press conference where Mr
Clive Thompson, chief executive, said he hoped Securiguard's board would
recommend the 270p a share offer.
The invitation was repeated in Rentokil's formal offer document, described
by one analyst as 'the least hostile in history'.
Securiguard's board declined, politely, to do so. There has been no further
contact between the two sides.
However, there are signs that the phoney war may soon be over. Securiguard
yesterday published its defence document, which dismissed Rentokil's offer
as derisory. 'Rentokil is hoping to secure a bargain at your expense,' the
document said.
Mr Alan Baldwin, Securiguard's chairman, may feel he can afford to appear
dismissive. His company's shares have traded comfortably above the offer
price and closed yesterday at 298p. 'If there's a fair price on the table,
then obviously we would talk,' he said in an interview last week.
Securiguard is an unsurprising takeover target. After growing rapidly in the
late 1980s, chiefly through expensive acquisitions in the UK and US, the
company's shares collapsed in 1990 when it released a profits warning amid
mounting borrowings. Although borrowings have been reduced by nearly half to
Pounds 9.6m, and pre-tax profits increased slightly last year from Pounds
5.03m to Pounds 5.74m, the shares badly lagged the recovery.
Rentokil was not the first to spot this buying opportunity. Some of
Securiguard's institutional shareholders bought into the company from 1991.
The three largest shareholders, holding nearly 30 per cent of the shares,
are sitting on potential profits of 50 per cent or more if they accept
Rentokil's offer. Given Securiguard's share price, they are instead expected
to wait for a higher offer. 'If Rentokil offers 310-320p it may get it. But
if the institutions get too greedy, Rentokil may walk away,' one analyst
said.
Rentokil made its bid mainly because it wants to develop a guarding service.
As with previous, successful, forays into areas like tropical plants, the
company believes it can earn higher margins than competitors by offering a
premium service. It also hopes to offer clients bundles of services, like
guarding or building management, to cement customer loyalty.
Securiguard's cleaning business would fit with Rentokil's office cleaning
and medical services operations. Mr Thompson seemed less interested in
Securiguard's courier businesses and its lossmaking personnel division.
The security services business includes guarding and man rather than systems
management. All hardware and systems work is sub-contracted. Its largest
contracts are at London Docklands, where about 120 guards are employed, and
at New York's JFK International airport.
The guarding industry in the UK includes about 2,000 companies, according to
some estimates, although many are very small. It is a low wage and low
margin business which has a poor reputation for quality.
Mr Baldwin said low margins stemmed from price competition and questioned
whether margins of more than 10 per cent were possible, compared with 5 to 6
per cent at present. 'It would need us to persuade clients, who already
believe they are getting a good service, to double their prices,' he said.
Securiguard's cleaning operations are also low margin and largely rely on
price sensitive local and central government contracts. Government contracts
account for about 60 per cent of turnover, if the company's hospital
contracts subsidiary Mediguard is included.
Rentokil has built up a loyal following in the City, which has been
impressed by the management's ability to lift margins in businesses as
diverse as pest control and building management. In the last 10 years,
pre-tax profits have increased from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 122.4m, helped by
acquisitions and internal growth.
Supporters also see the bid's logic of buying security services customers to
grow a new division, and adding volume in cleaning.
What worries some observers, however, is a suspicion that Rentokil is
putting its determination to maintain earnings growth ahead of business
sense. They suspect that Rentokil, faced with slowing organic growth in the
UK especially, needed an undervalued takeover to enhance earnings.
If so, Mr Thompson faces a painstaking task deciding whether and by how far
to raise his bid once the first closing date of June 11 is reached.
Meanwhile, Securiguard's defence document took great care not to criticise
its predator. Mr Baldwin and his board must realise that if Rentokil walked
away, Securiguard's shares would be in danger of reverting to their pre-bid
level.
'One has to assume that a slightly higher bid would go through recommended,'
an analyst said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Norcros drops 26% and calls for Pounds
49.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORCROS, the building products manufacturer, yesterday announced a 2-for-7
rights issue raising Pounds 49.7m net to take advantage of the property
upturn, as it unveiled a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year
ended March 31.
The shares are being offered at 132p - a substantial discount to the
existing share price which slipped 3p to 165p on a day the market also fell.
Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 11.5m after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 100,000) to cover the cost of
restructuring. The workforce was reduced by a further 700 to about 7,000.
The group plans to use the rights proceeds to reduce borrowings and to make
bolt-on acquisitions to its core business of building products. Debt fell by
Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 120.2m resulting in a lower interest charge of Pounds
6.3m (Pounds 8.6m).
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said the group was well placed to take
advantage of any upturn in the UK.
While it remained committed to disposing of its property portfolio, recently
valued at Pounds 45m, Mr Doherty said the rights proceeds would enable it to
sell at a more leisurely pace.
Property disposals during the year amounted to Pounds 16.9m. A provision for
the fall in value of the disposed property was mainly responsible for an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 7.9m.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 22.3m on reduced sales of
Pounds 389.7m (Pounds 394m).
Those from building products increased from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 7.76m;
ceramics saw a reduction from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 7.4m and printing and
packaging reported Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 12m).
The final dividend is held at 3.5p making an unchanged total of 7p. Earnings
per share fell from 7.5p to 5p.
COMMENT
Given the history of false dawns in the building sector it would be
surprising if investors did not treat the latest optimistic soundings from
Norcros with more than a dollop of scepticism. The UK recovery already
appears to be faltering and borrowings, notwithstanding the rights issue,
will remain quite high. However, the results of the restructuring, resulting
in the loss of a further 700 jobs, puts the company on a better footing
should the UK experience a sustained upturn. Analysts estimate that every
pound in sales should yield 33p in operating profits. Faced with a choice of
either selling property or tapping shareholders for cash the latter was
preferable. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.5m the shares are on
a prospective multiple of 17.6, and shareholders should probably give the
company the benefit of the doubt one more time.

A good contribution from its curtain tape business, which was acquired a
year ago, together with the disposal of lossmaking Kaz Krafts were behind
the interim advance at Thomas French &amp; Sons.
In the six months to April 3 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 299,000 to
Pounds 725,000 on sales 22 per cent higher at Pounds 7.52m. Interest
payments increased to Pounds 133,000 (Pounds 40,000) partly due to
acquisition costs.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.45p on earnings per share of 3.99p
(1.47p).

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn falls to Pounds 21.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWELL DUFFRYN, the dist-ribution, storage and engineering group, said
yesterday that its restructuring programme was bearing fruit in spite of the
impact of accountancy changes and the closure of two UK railway freight
wagon plants.
Under FRS 3, the group's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds
21.6m in the year to March 31.
However, the previous year's result was inflated by an Pounds 11.4m
exceptional gain on disposals, and the latest figure was depressed by a
Pounds 7m charge caused by the plant closures.
Stripping out the exceptionals, pre-tax profits increased by 20 per cent,
from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 28.6m.
Sales grew from Pounds 684.1m to Pounds 697.5m.
Net debt fell from Pounds 50.7m to Pounds 29.5m and the gearing ratio was
reduced from 31 to 19 per cent.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said: 'The benefits of the corporate changes of
the past two years are becoming increasingly evident in our results. We have
good reason to look ahead with confidence to our improved earnings stream.'
The impact of recession and another mild winter saw operating profits from
fuel distribution plunge from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 5.4m, on sales which
declined slightly, from Pounds 369.4m to Pounds 362m.
Engineering increased operating profits from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 16.3m on
sales which rose from Pounds 229.8m to Pounds 232.7m. The group said its
enlarged combustion interests and pump and refuse collection activities had
made commendable progress.
Port services and shipping increased operating profits from Pounds 3.4m to
to Pounds 7.3m, thanks to a full contribution from Tees and Hartlepool.
Turnover rose from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 64.7m.
The storage division increased its operating profit from Pounds 4m to Pounds
7.2m. The group said there had been a noteworthy increase in profitability,
led by the UK and US terminals, where both cost management and better terms
of trade helped the result.
Earnings per share under FRS 3 fell from 36.9p to 18.6p. Stripping out the
exceptionals, earnings rose from 20.2p to 28.8p.
A final dividend of 16p maintains the total at 22.6p.
COMMENT
It seems reasonable to ignore the effects of FRS 3 on these results, since
the exceptional gains and losses largely cancel each other out. The
underlying performance is impressive, particularly since the group has had
to cope with yet another mild winter while continuing to restructure. The
exit from railway freight trucks also elicits sympathy: who could have
forecast that a major country would be prepared to build a Channel tunnel,
but then not invest in new rolling stock? The shares have had a very good
run in the last 18 months, as the City has cottoned on to the new strategy.
But forecast profits of Pounds 35m next year put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 15.5, only a small premium to the market. Any further advance
will be more modest, but the shares still offer a yield premium and further
growth prospects.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GBE for market via Downiebrae
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ENGLISH company mak-ing tobacco processing equipment since 1849 and with
sales to more than 76 countries, is coming to the stock market through a
reverse takeover of Downiebrae, the shell company suspended last month at
77p.
GBE International, which emerged from a management buy-out from AMF
International of the US in 1986, will take over management of Downiebrae,
which has two small engineering companies and a pile of cash.
Downiebrae is issuing 36.67m new shares to pay for GBE, valuing the company
at Pounds 22m. Most of this will repay GBE's venture capitalist backers and
management and the GBE employee trust will retain the balance.
Some 24.98m of the shares are being placed at 60p and 7.78m are being
offered in a 4-for-9 rights issue, also at 60p.
Beeson Gregory is broker and has underwritten the placing and the rights
issue.
Mr Robert Newman, a London-based businessman who owns the women's health
club The Sanctuary and bought a 29.9 per cent stake in Downiebrae in
February this year, will not be selling his stake. After dilution this stake
will fall to less than than 10 per cent, making him the second largest
shareholder after Mr Gerald Edwards, chairman of GBE.
Mr Newman will relinquish his position as chief executive but will continue
to seek acquisition opportunities as a consultant to Downiebrae.
He said he did not have day to day management skills and that GBE's
management could not be improved. He would be in a better position to seek
further acquisitions as a consultant.
In the year to December 1992, GBE made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.25m on
sales of Pounds 34.7m. The company derives most of its sales from process
engineering.
Mr Newman owned a 29.9 per cent stake in Downibrae until 1988 when he sold
to Mr Jacques Gaston Murray. He bought it back in February, saying it was an
ideal vehicle for doing acquisitions.
The enlarged group will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 31m.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place net asset value 13% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET ASSETS per share at St James's Place Capital, the investment company
chaired by Lord Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, rose by 13 per cent from
95.5p to 107.7p in the year to end-March.
The directors take the view that the company should be judged on a net asset
basis, rather than on the profit and loss account. Pre-tax profits fell to
Pounds 9m, against Pounds 18.4m.
Losses in dealing investments rose to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 7.5m) mainly
because European interest rates took longer to fall than anticipated.
The company was formed after the demerger of J Rothschild Holdings. It
operates a fund management arm and has interests in J Rothschild Assurance,
a life company, J Rothschild, Wolfensohn, a corporate finance business and a
stake in RIT Capital Partners.
The increased value of the stake in RIT was the main factor behind the
increase in net asset value over the period.
A final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 3p, payable from earnings of 3.8p
(9.7p). The shares slipped 2p to 105p.
RIT, the investment trust, reported a 29 per cent increase in fully diluted
net asset value from 140.7p to 181.1p. The shares rose 3p to 141p.
The main reason for the increase was the rise in the value of its holding in
Newmont Mining. It sold a third of its 7 per cent holding to Mr George
Soros, the international fund manager who recently invested Dollars 400m
(Pounds 260m) in gold.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: VSEL's 16% rise boosts shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in VSEL Consortium rose 26p to 795p after the Barrow-based builder of
Trident submarines reported a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for
the year to end-March.
Although sales fell by Pounds 78m to Pounds 441.9m profits rose from Pounds
47.9m to Pounds 55.6m pre-tax. Strong cash flow meant interest receivable
rose from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 13.9m. Cash and cash equivalents improved
from Pounds 201.8m to Pounds 251.1m.
VSEL said its recent successful tender to build a Pounds 170m helicopter
carrier marked a successful return to building surface warships - a key
element in the group's strategy for coping with life after Trident.
The group said it had nothing to fear from a recently-announced National
Audit Office inquiry into why its tender was Pounds 50m lower than a rival
bid from Swan Hunter, the Tyneside yard which went into receivership after
failing to gain the work.
Mr Noel Davies, VSEL's chief executive, said that while his company had
'sharpened its pencil' to produce the final tender, he could only assume
that Swan Hunter believed the government would not let the Tyneside yard
close, and had priced its tender accordingly.
VSEL confirmed that it would close the Cammell Laird yard on Merseyside next
month, with the loss of 600 jobs. The group said the main reason it had
failed to find a buyer for the Birkenhead yard was the inability to have the
yard designated as having access to EC subsidies.
Lord Chalfont, VSEL's chairman, said it was expected that the UK's warship
building industry would contract from about 21,000 employees in five
shipyards in 1990, to about 6,000 in perhaps two or three yards by the
second half of the decade. The group currently employs 7,600 people at
Barrow, a figure which is set to fall to about 5,000.
Lord Chalfont said: 'The board is confident that, in the light of its unique
submarine capabilities, versatile resources and financial strength, coupled
with its renewed participation in the surface shipbuilding market, VSEL will
remain a dominant force in the industry.'
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 93.4p (82.4p). A recommended
final dividend of 20p (17p) gives a total for the year of 29p (25p), an
increase of 16 per cent.
COMMENT
Swan Hunter's loss is VSEL's gain, allowing the Barrow group to bridge
neatly the looming gap between the rundown of the current Trident programme
and the next generation of attack submarines, which should start their
tendering process this year. VSEL has handled the shrinking process
remarkably smoothly and winning the helicopter carrier also improves its
chances of winning orders for more, and larger, surface vessels. Forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 60m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 8,
which still looks undemanding - in spite of the rerating it has enjoyed with
other defence stocks. The shares are unlikely to ever trade on a market
average multiple, but the hefty dividend increase ensures they maintain a
yield premium.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Emap to expand radio side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the newspaper, mag-azine and exhibitions group, is hoping to expand
its presence in commercial radio. The company yesterday submitted an
application to the Radio Authority for one of two new commercial AM licences
available for London.
The Emap-backed consortium, London AM, chaired by Ms Joan Bakewell the
television presenter, will be aimed mainly, but not entirely, at women.
Research carried out by the consortium, the directors of which also include
Ms Felicity Kendal, the actress, Ms Liz Kershaw, the radio DJ and Ms Sarah
Greene, the television presenter, suggests that women are not well served by
commercial radio in London.
There is a rival consortium, which is also targeting female listeners, put
together by Ms Lyne Franks, the public relations specialist. This consortium
is backed by Jazz FM, the London station which recently won the new regional
licence for the nort- west of England.
Emap is also re-applying for its Kiss FM licence in London. If its London AM
application is successful it will run the two in tandem.
The publishing group controls Radio City in Liverpool and has a 29 per cent
stake in Trans World which runs commercial radio stations in Manchester,
Leeds and Preston.
Applications for a total of eight London commercial licences have to be with
the Radio Authority by Tuesday.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: MEPC falls to Pounds 53m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday announced a 10.4
per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds 52.5m in the
six months to end-March.
The company surprised the City by not announcing a rights issue, although it
insisted that its options on fund-raising remained open. 'The board has not
made a decision,' said Mr James Tuckey, managing director. 'It doesn't rule
out the possibility.'
Many analysts believe that MEPC will join other large property companies in
taking advantage of a revival in property share prices to issue new equity.
The most recent example was Wednesday's announcement of a Pounds 132m rights
issue by British Land, which has formed a partnership with the Quantum Fund
run by Mr George Soros, the international financier, to invest in UK
property.
MEPC's shares slipped 5p to 443p, in line with a general decline in property
share values, as investors took profits following a surge in prices on
Wednesday.
The company was cautiously optimistic about the market. 'My intuitive
judgement says that the bottom has passed,' said Mr Tuckey.
'There are now some indications of new demand from occupiers beginning to
emerge in pockets around the country. This, coupled with evidence of
institutions returning to invest once again in property, provides the
potential for a return to growth,' said Sir Christopher Benson, chairman.
The decline in MEPC's interim profits stemmed from an increase in the cost
of net finance from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds 52.5m. This resulted from a
decline in interest capitalised for properties in the course of development
from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 9.6m, along with lower interest income and
continued high fixed interest rates on group debt.
Group rental income increased from Pounds 158m to Pounds 165m. The overall
vacancy rate fell from 8 per cent at the end of last year to 6.5 per cent.
MEPC said that its cash flow had been supplemented by a reduction in capital
spending coupled with property sales.
Mr Tuckey said that the programme of property sales was likely to slow down,
although MEPC would continue to dispose of properties that had limited
growth prospects, particularly in central London. He said the company wished
to increase its exposure to overseas property, particularly in the US and
continental Europe.
Earnings per share fell from 12.4p to 10.4p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 5.25p.

FT  04 JUN 93 / DTI was asked to probe Alpine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry was asked in February to launch an
inquiry into events at Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading earlier
this week.
A solicitor's letter written on February 12 on behalf of some franchisees
and former employees called on the DTI to investigate the activities and
administration of Alpine. This was almost a year after Alpine was purchased
out of administration by a group of investors backed by Mr Clive Smith, the
Midlands entrepreneur.
Mr Smith, who has a number of off-shore trusts, has been connected to
several natural resource companies, two of which are being investigated by
the Serious Fraud Office.
The solicitors told the DTI in February their investigations had 'caused
considerable concern about the financial stability of Alpine'. They drew
attention to questions over the alleged transfer of monies.
They also queried pension payments deducted from salaries, since Alpine did
not have an approved pension scheme.
Furthermore, the letter states, one former employee represented by the
solicitor had access to bank statements which he claims show that over
Pounds 600,000 was transferred out of Alpine following its purchase.
It also emerged yesterday that a creditor owed Pounds 30,000 had lodged a
petition to wind up Alpine, due to be heard on June 16.
However, Alpine's directors recently instructed an insolvency practitioner
to call a creditors meeting to vote on liquidation the day before that
petition is heard.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Boots shares slip despite 19% profit rise: Chief executive
attempts to quell City fears over group strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals
group, vigorously defended his company's strategy yesterday, as he unveiled
a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 405.2m.
Sir James attempted to quell fears in the City of London that margin growth
at Boots the Chemists - the group's best-performing division - was
threatened by price competition from rivals, and that profits at Boots
Pharmaceuticals could be hit by problems with its Manoplax heart drug.
But his comments could not stop Boots's share price falling 3p to 444p. The
shares have underperformed the market by almost 25 per cent since January.
'Boots has not stopped being a good company, but there is still a big
perceived risk surrounding its strategy,' said one analyst.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March increased to Pounds 405.2m from last
year's Pounds 340.7m - restated according to the FRS3 accounting standard -
on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 3.96bn.
The profits improvement was due partly to last year's figure being depressed
by a Pounds 15.8m exceptional provision for a loss on discontinued
operations, while this year's profit was boosted by a lower interest charge
of Pounds 16.5m, down from Pounds 43.1m. That reflected a fall in debt from
Pounds 362.3m to Pounds 203.8m. The total dividend increased 1p to 13.4p,
while earnings increased 17.4 per cent to 27.0p. Operating profits rose 5.5
per cent to Pounds 421.7m, but only two of Boots's four divisions showed
growth. Boots the Chemists raised its contribution from Pounds 246.2m to
Pounds 285m, while Boots Properties, the property management division,
advanced 2.5 per cent to Pounds 53.1m.
Sir James said Boots the Chemists' net margin had increased to 10.7 per cent
thanks to improved productivity and a better product mix. Market research
had shown that customer perceptions of its prices had not been damaged by
recent discounting campaigns by its rival Superdrug. He reiterated his
commitment to increasing margins.
'Severe discounting does not build market share, and destroys long-term
shareholder value.'
Operating profits at Boots Pharmaceuticals fell to Pounds 108.5m from Pounds
120.8m, due mainly to the Pounds 20m spent on marketing Manoplax, its
treatment for congestive heart failure.
Sir James said the drug could still be a success despite trials which showed
that patients suffered higher mortality rates at certain doses than on a
placebo. He said Manoplax was designed to enhance the quality of life for
sufferers, rather than increase life expectancy, and demand from clinicians
was growing.
The company is awaiting a ruling from the US Food and Drug Administration on
whether the drug can remain in circulation.
Operating losses of Pounds 3.4m in Boots's retailing division were unchanged
from last year. A significant improvement at Halfords from a Pounds 9.5m
loss to a Pounds 4.7m profit was more than cancelled out by a Pounds 14.4m
loss (from a Pounds 200,000 profit) on the company's share of Do It All, the
DIY joint venture with WH Smith.
Sir James insisted both partners were committed to bringing Do It All into
profit, by developing its own brand, and introducing a new store format. But
he refused to say how long Boots was prepared to wait for the DIY retailer
to show a profit.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Volkswagen aims to return to profit in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's troubled motor manufacturer, hopes to be back in
profit by the third quarter of the year, after a record DM1.25bn (Pounds
.50bn) loss in the first three months, shareholders were told yesterday.
Radical cost-cutting, including short-shift working in many parts of the
company, brought it to the brink of break-even during one of the months of
the second quarter, Mr Werner Schmidt, the group's chief financial officer,
told the annual meeting in Hamburg.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chief executive, said production had been cut back by
200,000 units in the January-May period, compared with a year earlier, to
reflect falling demand, especially in the German market.
He confirmed the gloomy figures for 1992, in which VW boosted its turnover
by 11.9 per cent to DM85.4bn, increased output 8.1 per cent to 3.5m
vehicles, and productivity 9.6 per cent, and yet saw pre-tax profits slump
66 per cent to DM602m.
He said that in the first four months of 1993 the total car market in
Germany shrank by 20 per cent and by 17 per cent in the major European
markets. Although the market in the US declined by only 0.1 per cent during
the same period, VW saw its own sales fall 8.8 per cent.
The major cause was a delay in production of the new Golf from the company's
Mexico plant, after a strike in 1992.
Overall, the group saw a decline in sales of 11.7 per cent, or 144,000
vehicles, with the Audi and Spanish-manufactured Seat models suffering
disproportionately, while VW brands lost only 8.5 per cent. The one piece of
good news he reported was an increase in sales of Czech-manufactured Skoda
cars, which increased by 22.9 per cent.
As a result, the company was unable to meet the full extent of demand with
its current capacity, he said.
Mr Piech spelt out the cost-cutting measures he had already implemented,
including 'massive' short-time working, rationalisation of production,
reduction of purchasing prices for suppliers, and personnel cuts in all
departments.
'We have done everything necessary to ensure that Volkswagen returns to the
black as soon as possible,' he said.
'That will not be the case in the second quarter, but we believe we will
achieve the turnround by the third quarter.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Smith faces attack from union chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH will come under veiled attack this weekend from the general
secretary of Britain's third-largest union for lacking boldness and
imagination as Labour party leader.
In a keynote speech to his annual conference on Sunday, Mr John Edmonds,
general secretary of the 860,000-strong GMB general union, will denounce
Labour's failure to seize the political opportunities provided in the past
12 months by the troubles of Mr John Major's government.
Although Mr Smith will not be criticised directly - because Mr Edmonds wants
to avoid personalising the issues - the speech is likely to be interpreted
as the first damaging public attack on the Labour leader from one of the
union leaders whose block votes ensured his victory in last autumn's
leadership election.
Mr Smith is a member of the GMB and has attended the conference for the past
three years, but Mr Edmonds has not invited him to speak to the delegates
this year.
The GMB, traditionally a centre-right union loyal to the Labour leadership,
appears under Mr Edmonds to have become a critic of the present state of the
Labour movement.
Mr Edmonds claims to have discovered widespread disillusionment and
discontent among union activists across the country in recent months, and he
intends to articulate their views.
He will argue that both the Labour party and the trade unions have lacked
focus for their attacks on the Conservatives. His speech will question
whether Labour's caution and patience have been a sensible way of responding
to what he regards as the government's wickedness.
The GMB general secretary is unlikely to compromise over the controversial
issue of one member, one vote for the selection of Labour parliamentary
candidates and election of the party leader and deputy leader.
Mr Smith has turned the issue into a test of his political credibility.
Mr Edmonds insists that union political levy-payers must have a voice in
such elections inside the Labour party through their affiliated unions,
arguing that Labour has a federal structure and is more than just a party of
individual members.
The union is also likely to give no comfort to those in the Labour party who
want to carry through parliamentary electoral reform like proportional
representation in parliamentary elections.
The GMB is expected to defend the existing first-past-the-post system of
electing MPs.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Stock exchange rules out US trading system: Cost cutting
fends off Nasdaq bid to replace Seaq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of the London Stock Exchange yesterday endorsed plans for a new
trading system to be developed by the exchange and Andersen Consulting after
the proposed cost was cut to fend off a late bid by Nasdaq, the US
over-the-counter stock exchange.
Nasdaq had offered to build a replacement for London's ageing dealing
system, known as Seaq, for Pounds 37m, undercutting the Andersen-stock
exchange system by more than Pounds 20m.
But the Andersen-exchange bid was cut to Pounds 40m, including the Pounds
15m already invested in the development of the system by the stock exchange,
so that the net new investment required was Pounds 25m.
Some members of the stock exchange board had forced a fresh hearing for the
Nasdaq proposal, as confidence in the exchange's ability to manage in-house
development projects sagged following the collapse of its Taurus paperless
settlement system project. The failed project cost the exchange an estimated
Pounds 75m.
But dissent over the choice of a new trading system waned after the pricing
differential was eroded. 'Andersen had a year's headstart, and once the
price came down, there was not really a good enough reason to get rid of
them,' said one stock exchange board member.
An independent review by IBM Consulting Group also backed the
Andersen-exchange proposal.
Mr Giles Vardey, markets development director at the exchange, said the
pitfalls of Taurus would be avoided.
'First, the exchange is not building the software this time. Second, one of
the lessons of Taurus was the importance of getting the requirements right,
agreeing with major users, freezing the specification and then going ahead
and getting it built.'
The project is expected to take 2 1/2 years, and will be implemented in four
phases. A new markets committee, made up of senior market practitioners to
be appointed by the board, will resolve remaining issues on the structure of
the new market.
The system will follow the quote-driven model of Seaq and Seaq
International, which is widely backed by market practitioners. Plans to add
a trade agreement function which had formed part of the original proposal,
have been abandoned.
The Seaq system was put into place after Big Bang in 1986 and was built up
in a piecemeal manner, resulting in an expensive and outmoded system.
'We need to have systems that are robust and flexible, able to last beyond
2000,' said Mr Vardey. 'The existing system is expensive to operate, and
though it has proved reliable there is a high risk over time as you try to
make changes.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Procordia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, Volvo's agreement with the Swedish government to carve up
their joint interest in Procordia looks a rare example of a deal that
pleases all sides. The Swedish government comes away with a focused
pharmaceutical company which will be easier to privatise than Procordia's
existing ragbag of businesses. Thanks to its Italian acquisitions the new
Procordia will have critical mass in world drug markets. Volvo, meanwhile,
acquires the cash-flow of Procordia's consumer products division and an
earnings stream which will satisfy Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar's - albeit
questionable - ambition to offset the cyclical nature of his automotive
business.
Still, the government seems to have come off best. Volvo has given up any
aspiration to own a majority stake in the new Procordia. There is no longer
a risk of other shareholders becoming an abused minority after
privatisation. Volvo's right to restore its stake to 35 per cent may instead
provide additional support for the shares. The new Procordia would have more
appeal if Volvo were to exit the drug business completely, but Swedish
business remains too nationalist for that.
The initial hurdle for Volvo is the cost - of some SKr3.5bn on the basis of
yesterday's valuation - of buying out minority shareholders in Procordia's
consumer products business. Volvo may consider the resolution of the
Procordia uncertainty strengthens its hand in merger negotiations with
Renault, but that deal hardly seems imminent. While they wait, Volvo
shareholders might ponder why they should increase their interest in mineral
water, beer, matches and hotels, if Procordia has become more marketable
without them.

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: MEPC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Things have reached a pretty pass when the City expresses disappointment
after a company eschews a dilutive rights issue. Such is the intoxicated
haze surrounding the property sector, that MEPC's abstinence comes as
something of an anti-climax. MEPC may be sticking to the commendable view
that diluting net asset values is a heinous offence. But it has not ruled
out the possibility. The suspicion remains that the summer will not pass
without it tapping the market.
The danger is that, without fresh funds, MEPC will be left behind in a
recovering property market. With gearing in excess of 80 per cent and thin
cash flow, MEPC has only limited scope to upgrade its assets and diversify
its portfolio. Its interim results suggest it may yet have to rely on
property disposals to justify a maintained annual dividend.
So far, the stock market has wafted most companies in the property sector
higher on a surge of sentiment. But the point must soon be reached where
differences in asset quality and growth prospects produce a marked
divergence in share performance. Those companies using cheap money to buy
properties yielding 9 per cent will usefully bolster income and increase
their exposure to any growth in asset values. Land Securities, British Land
and Brixton Estate, have already positioned themselves to benefit. MEPC must
decide whether it dares follow suit.

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of non-compliance uncovered at Invesco MIM is staggering. While
those responsible deserve opprobrium, the more serious question is how one
of the UK's largest investment managers was allowed to get into such a
state. Since some of the 55 charges go back to 1988, the regulators and the
company's auditor had time to spot trouble before Mr Maxwell's raid on the
Mirror Group pension fund brought matters to a head. Having fined Invesco
for mismanaging personal equity plans in 1989, Imro should have clamped down
on lax standards elsewhere in the group.
The improvements to Imro's procedures recommended by the Securities and
Investments Board - and the tough new style for SIB advocated by Mr Andrew
Large, its chairman - might close the more gaping holes in the regulatory
net. But it is hard to imagine that the fine imposed on Invesco will act as
much of a deterrent. While there is little sense in heaping fines on a
company now diligently putting its house in order, SIB should consider
wheeling out its as-yet-unused powers against individuals in such cases.
That might help generate the commitment to compliance that has evidently
been lacking.
After almost three years living hand in glove with the regulator, Invesco at
least should demonstrate an exemplary record from here on. It is hard to
argue that the regulatory system has come through in good shape.

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Leaking Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time it seems fair to draw a line under Boots' ill-fated Pounds 900m
Ward White acquisition, something else goes wrong. The further deterioration
in the Do It All home improvement chain is just the latest misfortune. Given
that neither WH Smith nor Boots seems sufficiently confident of a cure to
pump substantial extra cash into the ailing joint venture, one wonders how
long it will be before Do It All is quietly put to sleep. At Halfords the
turnround is welcome, but it comes much too late for much credit to attach
to Boots' management. The fond hope that Halfords can double its turnover
while raising its margins fivefold also looks odd since Boots has
conspicuously failed to translate the success of its chemist chain to any
other retail area.
Unfortunately, it is not as though things were going well in
pharmaceuticals. Manoplax continues to develop complications, and it will
never make substantial profits, even if it remains on the market. Without
it, the company's new drugs pipeline resembles a rather leaky garden hose.
The group's saving grace is the Boots the Chemist chain which continues to
throw off cash at a remarkable rate. Margin growth may now be slowing, but
Superdrug's attempts to portray Boots as expensive may stick. Boots is still
trying to push up margins while others, such as Marks and Spencer, are
passing efficiency improvements on to customers to reap volume gains. Much
of that risk is reflected in Boots' discount rating to the stores sector.
Still, the fear remains that the company is strategically challenged and may
use its strong cash flows to go on another reckless spending spree.

FT  04 JUN 93 / G7 officials take hard look at record of EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said yesterday the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries was debating the role of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development after disclosures of extravagance in
the setting up of its London headquarters.
At a press briefing in Paris, before travelling to Russia for talks with
President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Bentsen confirmed he had discussed the EBRD's
low disbursements with the G7 partners, but declined to give details.
Asked whether there was a case for removing Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's
president, Mr Bentsen said: 'I think that is for the Europeans.' The other
G7 members are Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy.
It emerged yesterday that a meeting in Paris on Wednesday night of the G7
deputies - the senior finance ministry officials - dropped some planned
agenda items and was devoted entirely to discussing the EBRD.
It is understood that it covered the bank's low disbursement of funds to the
former Communist countries, questions surrounding its top management and the
need for better relations between the countries that own the bank and the
people who run it.
According to a G7 official close to the group, some of the senior finance
ministry officials present believed Mr Attali should be replaced. The G7
countries, which together have a majority stake in the bank, have been
discussing possible candidates, the official added.
Mr Attali is reported to be fighting for his job and there is no sign that
the governments of the countries and agencies that own the bank, set up two
years ago, have decided to remove him.
His continuation in office is creating special difficulties for the US.
Congress has refused to vote funds to pay a tranche of capital for the EBRD.
There are also fears that it will be reluctant to vote additional funds for
other international financial institutions, on which the US is relying to
channel aid and expertise to Russia and other former Communist states.
In a move that may have been inspired by recent allegations about the EBRD,
Mr Bentsen said the US wanted to set up an aid utilisation office in Moscow
'to make certain that every bit of money that goes to the transition effort
is spent wisely'.
Canadian and US officials have been particularly critical in the past few
weeks of Mr Attali's performance.

   DUNDEE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by senior trade union officials to end the Timex dispute in Dundee
suffered a severe setback yesterday when terms negotiated with the Timex
management were angrily rejected by the dismissed workforce.
A mass meeting addressed by Mr Jimmy Airlie, Scottish organiser of the AEEU
engineering union, ended after only half an hour when the dismissed workers
voted unanimously against accepting terms which Mr Airlie described as
'draconian' although considered to be the best on offer.
The terms would have allowed all dismissed workers to return to work at the
printed circuit board factory, subject to their capabilities being assessed.
But they would have had to accept conditions amounting to a 27 per cent cut
in pay and benefits.
Those who wanted would receive statutory redundancy payments, something Mr
Airlie said had never been achieved before after workers had already been
sacked.
The Timex dispute, now in its 18th week, worsened after Timex sacked its
entire hourly paid workforce of 340 people, four in five of them women,
after they rejected a peace plan. Timex then hired 290 hourly paid workers
who are bused through the picket line to the plant.
After yesterday's mass meeting the sacked workforce vowed to step up the
dispute.
They called the settlement terms 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous' and chanted:
'The workers, united, will never be defeated.'
Mr Airlie said the settlement terms had been agreed with Timex officials in
eight weeks of secret negotiations. Although he could not recommend them, he
was duty bound to put the package to the sacked workforce.
The company wanted a pay freeze this year with any pay increase in 1994
dependent on the plant's making a profit in the first three quarters of the
year. The company would cut its pension contribution by 25 per cent and
reduce the scope of its sick pay scheme. The subsidy on meals in the canteen
would be withdrawn.
Mr Airlie said it was an indication of the strength of feeling of the
dismissed workforce that they were 'not enticed by redundancy money which
would run into many thousands of pounds in many cases'.

FT  04 JUN 93 / US withdraws 'quit smoking' aids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICANS indulging in what King James VI of Scotland called the vile and
evil habit of smoking tobacco will no longer have the benefit of
non-prescription products to help them in their efforts to give up.
The US Food and Drug Administration has decided there is no evidence that
any of the existing over-the-counter (OTC) products actually work. They are
to be withdrawn from December.
'These products are safe enough,' said Mr Mike Shaffer, a public affairs
officer at the FDA. 'But there is no evidence that they work. We're not
saying they don't work, just that we don't know if they do.'
The products, supported by millions of dollars of advertising, include
Cigarrest, Bantron, Tabmint and Nikoban. Tabmint, a chewing gum that
contains silver acetate and which is supposed to make smoke taste
unpleasant, is available in Britain.
The withdrawn products do not include Nicorette gum and nicotine patches
which, although available without a prescription in the UK, are not
available over the counter in the US.
The US move led to calls yesterday in the UK for all OTC smoking cessation
products to be withdrawn, including patches and nicotine gums.
Ms Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, a charity dedicated to helping smokers
give up, said there was no evidence that any products worked when bought at
a chemist without a prescription. These include Nicobrevin, a product
containing quinine, camphor and oil of eucalyptus, and the recently launched
and commercially successful nicotine patches.
'(Nicotine patches) may help motivation, but there is no evidence they are
more effective than a placebo' when used without counselling, she said.

<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S EC agreement on a 48-hour maximum working week and other limits
on working time reflects poorly on everyone involved. Britain, the
odd-country-out on community social policy, remains truculent and isolated
to the last. Having campaigned with bogus figures and matchless bluster,
before abstaining in the crucial vote, the UK will now take the matter to
the European Court.
The European Commission stands accused, backed by key member states, of
disguising the changes as a health and safety measure, in order to make them
subject to majority rather than unanimous voting in the council. Some member
states have meanwhile let it be known privately that while they agree with
Britain, they cannot afford to be seen to do so.
When these new measures reach national statute books in three or four years,
they will in reality make little impact, since most of the 12 have legal
restrictions which already match or are tighter than required under the EC
agreement.
Britain, the only country with no legal limits on the working week or
minimum holiday entitlements, faces the biggest shift. Yet even in Britain,
the effect promises to be modest; mutually voluntary arrangements are exempt
from the rules, as are certain occupations, and there is to be a delay of at
least 10 years before the start of the 48-hour week as such. Most ironic of
all, the fact that the measure has been classified as 'health and safety'
means that it will be overseen by a hard-pressed health and safety
executive, which is unlikely to make policing of working-hours registers its
highest priority.
The most striking fact of all, however, is that in the three years it has
taken the 12 to agree a form of words on working hours, unemployment in the
Community has risen by 3.2m, from 8.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent. It is still
rising.
These years have also brought the prospect of a greatly enlarged Community,
and the cracking of the EC's exchange rate regime under the strain of
economic diversity among its existing 12 members. If ever it were possible
to imagine a lockstep march towards identical working conditions from
Copenhagen to Athens, that moment has surely passed. What workers want from
Community social policy today is most of all an economy sufficiently
competitive and prosperous to provide them with jobs.
There have been welcome signs lately that the Commission may be beginning to
recognise the case for making job creation a higher priority than labour
rule harmonisation, or at least to calculate the cost of any proposed social
measures. If that means anything, it implies further flexibility on labour
market regulation.
None of this is to imply that any well-run company would want systematically
to deny its workforce a daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours, at least
one day a week off, a break after six hours and at least three to four
weeks' annual holiday. But these are goals not best achieved by
Community-wide laws irregularly enforced by inspectors with more important
tasks to perform.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Hard look at soft option: Japan's big computer makers face a
difficult road back to profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu of Japan last year lost money for the first time since 1949. NEC has
joined it in the red, while Hitachi has already reported stagnant sales and
sharply reduced taxable profits.
The three companies hand-picked by the Japanese government 40 years ago to
lead the country's attack on the world's large computer market are reeling
from the same blows that have had western computer companies on the ropes
for the past three years.
Recession and economic instability have persuaded customers to trim capital
spending. Rapid technological change has sown uncertainty and caution.
Through the 1980s, Japanese mainframe manufacturers were sustained and
protected by a buoyant home market. Large Japanese companies, some steps
behind the west in data processing sophistication, were locked into the
concept of centralised mainframes housed in data centres, a business model
created and perpetuated by International Business Machines of the US.
Fujitsu, the spearhead of Japan's computer industry and the world's number
two information technology company, saw IBM as both its chief competitor and
its principal role model. Its computers were functionally similar to IBM's
and ran the same software. Its aim was to be the world leader in information
technology through a 'family' of companies in which it took equity stakes.
Since 1990, that family has included ICL of the UK, in which it has an 80
per cent share.
Many saw Fujitsu's takeover of ICL as an opportunistic move which would make
the UK company a Trojan horse for Japanese ambitions in the European
computer market.
While the rationale for the takeover was ICL's need for a well-heeled
partner, Fujitsu's stake may prove to be its own salvation in a rapidly
changing world.
Today, the mainframe market is dwindling worldwide. The larger manufacturers
are talking of a 40 per cent decline over the past four years. The market
will not return; neither will yesterday's profitability.
For companies such as IBM and Fujitsu there is an obvious path back to the
black. They have to shed staff to match overheads to likely levels of
profitability. They have to shift their emphasis from mainframes to smaller
computers and open systems, and they have to derive an increasingly larger
share of their revenues from software and computing services rather than
hardware.
Japanese companies have an indifferent track record here. Lifetime
employment may be withering, but they still find it difficult to shed staff.
They have little experience of open systems, and their expertise in software
and services is limited to Japan. A Japanese company would find it difficult
to overcome the cultural problems in managing a large computer project
abroad.
Fujitsu, however, the only Japanese mainframe maker with a majority stake in
a western computer company, has in ICL a rich source of technical and
managerial knowhow about the new shape of the computer industry. A cash
crisis in the early 1980s forced the UK company to make early cuts in staff
numbers. It has widely acknowledged expertise in open systems. More than
half its revenues are now derived from software and services. And it is
profitable, making Pounds 38.6m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 2.48bn last year.
It could be argued that ICL is massaging figures that are barely better than
break-even, but it is better than the losses most computer companies are
suffering.
Fujitsu is not optimistic about the outlook for the current year, and unless
its restructuring and cost-cutting programme is effective, it has little
reason to be.
ICL, on the other hand, should hold its own and, indeed, grow if and when
Europe's economies improve. Fujitsu speaks of ICL as an elite member of its
global family.
Given the tenfold difference in their revenues, it would be ridiculous to
talk of reverse takeovers; but if Fujitsu looks to its UK subsidiary for
guidance through the computing jungle, then ICL's influence with its
Japanese parent should grow out of all proportion to its size. Fujitsu,
after all, has already entrusted its operations in the US and Europe to
ICL's management.
When it bought ICL in 1990, Fujitsu said it would float the company on the
London market within five years, giving it a value of at least Pounds 1.2bn.
To date, the economy has not favoured flotation, but merchant bankers and
advisers have been appointed and the company is gearing itself up to go
public. Investors could find that, far from backing a Japanese Trojan horse,
designed to invade the European computer industry, they will be investing in
a European company ready to play a fundamental role in the restructuring of
Japan's leading computer company.

A director of Colombia's central bank, en route to a pow-wow with his
opposite numbers in Venezuela the other day, was caught at Bogota airport
with a small amount of marijuana.
He was released on the basis that it was only a 'personal dose'. It is hard
to imagine the Bank of England's new governor 'Hard' Eddie George lighting
up a joint to relieve the boredom of the endless round of EC central bankers
meetings.
But his new deputy, former Economist editor Rupert Pennant-Rea, may be more
sympathetic to the plight of his unlucky Colombian colleague given his
well-known desire to decriminalise drugs.

Hans van den Broek, the EC commissioner for external political relations,

When questioned about his lack of visibility, the ever-cheerful Van den

Guess who turned out to be the party poopers at yesterday's annual
ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development?
While the US and Japan were goading the Paris-based bureaucrats on to ever
more ambitious tasks in foreign parts, British Foreign Office minister
Douglas Hogg was being difficult. There were quite enough international
bodies romping around former Iron Curtain countries, he reasoned, so why
should resources be diverted away from traditional fields of endeavour?
Nor had the organisation's annual 8 per cent cost increase escaped his eagle
eye. Those tax-free salaries might be all very motivating, but who had
considered affordability? The last person to raise this indelicate subject
was Britain's ex- chancellor Norman Lamont, who had much the same thing to
say on the subject of IMF and World Bank pay levels during his April sojourn
in Washington DC.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Observer: Dallara takes charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With close to 100 think-tanks fighting for attention in Washington DC,
finding figureheads who will both fit in and be noticed by the international
community can take time. But one post which has taken a particularly long
time to fill is atop the Institute of International Finance.
However, Observer is glad to report that the search is finally over. Charles
Dallara, who takes over next month, has the sort of resume appropriate for
an organisation whose two previous heads have been Andre de Lattre, former
vice governor of the Bank of France, and Horst Schulman, long time German
economic guru and, since the end of last year, president of the
Landeszentralbank in Hesse.
Dallara, 44, is currently a managing director at J P Morgan, in charge of
most of its non-American financing and advisory business. But he is best
known in Washington for his service in the Reagan and Bush administrations
as US executive director at the IMF and then as assistant Treasury secretary
for international affairs, which he left in the middle of 1991.
He has all the right connections and is on the boards of bodies such as the
German Marshall Fund, the American Council on Germany and the US-Japan
Business Council. But the big question is whether a body set up to help sort
out the problems of the third world debt crisis can find a new role for
itself now that the debt crisis no longer looms so large in the affairs of
its members.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Closing ERM fault lines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS to be done with the ERM? The answer of the top policy-makers of the
European Community is apparently 'nothing'. Reports from the monetary
committee and the heads of the EC central banks agree that the ERM needs to
be better, by which they mean more flexibly, managed. This view is not
persuasive.
This is far more than a technical matter. The purpose of the ERM is to
contribute to the harmonious economic development of the EC. This it has of
late failed to do. The gross domestic product of the EC rose by only 0.7 per
cent in 1991 and then by 1.1 per cent in 1992. GDP is likely to fall this
year. This dismal performance partly reflects the way the ERM has spread the
effects of mismanaged German unification.
When Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the distinguished Danish central bank chief,
complains that currency co-operation has collapsed because of 'competitive
devaluations' he confuses the symptoms of the ailment with its cause.
Countries such as Denmark are caught between the unmentionable - the
perverse policies of unified Germany - and the intolerable - their recent
decline in competitiveness. It is not surprising that they feel frustrated.
But to imagine that things would be fine if these devaluations had been
prevented is fantasy.
So what needs to be done? Three points must be made.
First, EC leaders must not be mesmerised by hopes for economic and monetary
union. Unless the convergence criteria are torn up, 1999 is now the earliest
plausible date for Emu. During the six intervening years, meeting the
convergence criteria must be reconciled with sensible macroeconomic
policies. That will be possible only if Germany turns its pro-European
rhetoric into domestic reality by aggressive rebalancing of its fiscal and
monetary policies.
Second, the EC must confront the economic failures demonstrated by this
week's interim OECD report on employment. How, EC leaders must ask
themselves, is the EC to secure lower unemployment and faster economic
growth? In the 1980s they found an answer in completing the single market.
In the 1990s the answer will lie not in Emu, but elsewhere, notably in the
labour market, but also in trade liberalisation and in efforts to reduce the
high burden of taxation.
ERM management
Finally, the ERM itself needs to be reformed.
Some believe the principal role of the ERM is to make disinflation more
credible. Others argue that the single market would prove either unworkable
or unacceptable without an exchange rate arrangement. The former objective
implies fixed nominal exchange rates, while the latter implies fixed real
exchange rates or, at the least, that changes in real exchange rates should
be limited to those warranted by economic fundamentals, including cyclical
divergences.
This distinction is important. The Italian lira, for example, suffered a 10
per cent deterioration in real competitiveness, vis a vis the rest of
Europe, between early 1987 and last September. It is also far from academic,
since one cause of the ERM crisis was the effects on competitiveness of
reliance on the fixed exchange rate route to lower inflation.
Events have made the choice. An ERM based on adjustable exchange rates and
operating under freedom for capital flows must set nominal exchange rates
that reflect competitiveness.
How far then would changes in management of the ERM suffice and how far must
the system itself be changed? The answer is that both are needed.
Credibility problem
For countries that already seem suitable for fixed exchange rates, the
difficulty with the ERM is imperfect credibility. Short of Emu, that problem
cannot be eliminated. A radical approach would be for the central banks,
presumably all independent, to announce their willingness to support one
another's currencies without limit, for as long as each country retains
stability-oriented policies.
For countries that need adjustable exchange rates, the principal difficulty
is that the bands have not allowed adequate interest rate flexibility. Nor
have they prevented the emergence of one-way bets for speculators. A part of
the solution is wider bands - perhaps as much as 10 per cent on either side
of the central rate. Another part is a presumption that there would either
be a change in monetary policy or a change in central parity, whenever a
currency deviates from its central rate by more than, say, half the width of
its band. Furthermore, the old and new exchange rate bands would overlap to
include the actual exchange rate - eliminating windfall gains for
speculators. A currency would also be switched into the narrow band only if
its exchange rate remained near the central rate for some years.
The EC must confront its central failings of slow growth and high
unemployment. At present, unfortunately, the EC's monetary arrangements,
both actual and planned, are proving an obstacle rather than a help. So Mr
Major was right to identify 'fault lines'. Unfortunately, the British
government seems to have done little to help the discussions about how to
remove them. Yet it would be both politically and economically foolish to
put sterling back into an unreformed ERM. In the new world of freedom for
capital flows and economic upheaval, the ERM must be made either more
flexible or more fixed. Ideally, it needs to be changed in both directions
at the same time.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Rebels with an uneasy cause: A complex legacy of bitterness
and hope after the events of Tiananmen square still divides Chinese
dissidents and their government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liu Xiaobo, accused by the Chinese authorities of being one of the four
'black hands' behind the bloodstained pro-democracy protests of 1989, is in
a reflective mood. 'The lesson for the Communist party,' he says over dinner
at Beijing's dowdy Friendship Hotel, 'is that it now knows that it can't
rely on shooting people to retain its political authority. On the other
hand, June 4 taught intellectuals like us that radical moves are not the
answer - change must come gradually.'
Four years ago this week, after a government crackdown on student protests
ended in massacre in and around Beijing's vast central Tiananmen square,
both sides appear to be groping in these calmer moments for a way to live
with a complex legacy. Time has hardly lessened the bitterness felt by many
Chinese over those events and, perhaps more importantly, it has not banished
a desire for a historical accounting.
Liu, who was jailed, but not charged, for what were described as
counter-revolutionary activities and defaming the state - he wrote pamphlets
during the disturbances - is not one of those burdened by bitterness.
Rather, he feels an almost overwhelming sadness.
'I could never have imagined they would shoot students,' he muses. 'It meant
that Deng Xiaoping jeopardised his own policies with his own hands, and also
lost the people's trust. The students, however, carried on the confrontation
too long. Both sides made too much of a sacrifice.
'It is time now,' Liu says, espousing a view that will not endear him to
some of his fellow dissidents, 'for the top leaders of the Communist party
and the people to make peace - to end the confrontation and make
improvements. Our slogan issued on June 2 1989 still serves the situation.
'We don't have enemies. We are all responsible for China's poverty and
backwardness.' '
Inevitably, China's accelerated economic liberalisation of the past year or
so has been accompanied by a political loosening, including an easing of
restriction on internal travel, and job mobility. The recent release of
prominent dissidents before their prison terms expired, and time itself,
have encouraged more open discussion among intellectuals of the lessons of
Tiananmen and perhaps surprisingly an appreciation of some of the gains.
None of this debate has appeared in the government-controlled media, in
which the Tiananmen massacre is rarely mentioned and then only in the tight
context of stern official judgment. The Communist party (which wrote the
history of Tiananmen within days of the massacre in a booklet entitled
Report on Checking the Turmoil and Quelling the Counter-Revolution
Rebellion) is not about to allow its version of events to be challenged. It
understands the stakes are high in terms of historical judgment, not only
for the individuals who ordered the crackdown but also for itself.
Liu, a bespectacled, scholarly 38-year-old who holds a doctorate in
philosophy and ethics from Beijing Normal University - one of China's most
prestigious universities - is both a casualty and a beneficiary of the
Tiananmen episode.
The events of 1989 projected him from being a moderately well-known
avant-garde writer on the ills of society to a controversial national
figure. But he has also become a 'non-person' as far as the state is
concerned. He was sacked from his job as a university teacher and, perhaps
more painful for someone who believes he has something to contribute to
China's intellectual discourse, he is barred from publishing his views in a
country where the party ultimately controls of all aspects of the media.
In spite of these restrictions, Liu hopes it will not be long before he is
allowed to publish again. In the meantime he is spending his time reading
and writing, and reflecting on the events of 1989. These are the subject of
his book, The Monologue of a Survivor of the Last Days, published in Taiwan
recently.
As with other intellectuals deeply involved in the June 4 movement, Liu, who
spent 18 months in jail, exhibits contradictory impulses towards Deng
Xiaoping, whom many Chinese believe was ultimately responsible for giving
the order to use force to put down the demonstrations. On one hand, Liu
believes that 'whoever ordered the soldiers to shoot should be punished
according to the law'.
On the other hand, he praises Deng's achievements as more considerable than
those of Mao Zedong himself, and describes the changes wrought in China in
the past few years as unimaginable.
'We must acknowledge that it was Deng Xiaoping who started the whole process
of liberalisation under which China is gradually being merged into the
mainstream of world culture,' he says.
Bao Zunxin, another of the four so-called 'black hands' - the prominent
intellectuals who were accused by the government of masterminding the
protest movement - would probably agree with Liu's assessment. But he
attributes the economic liberalisation in China in the past year or so
firmly and directly to the events of 1989.
Speaking in a small, book-lined study in his Beijing apartment, Bao, who
served more than 40 months in jail for his role in helping to inspire and
organise the protests, says that, while the world seemed to stop in 1989,
actually the shock of those events galvanised the leadership into action,
preparing the ground for the accelerated economic opening of 1992-93.
He believes that Deng's tour of southern China early last year, in which he
urged speedier economic reform, can be traced to Tiananmen. Likewise, he
believes, the Communist party's official embrace of a 'market economy' at
its 14th Congress last year was driven by the events of 1989.
'People did not make a sacrifice in vain. The movement was not a failure; it
was not doomed,' says Bao, who is in the same 'non-person' category as Liu,
sacked from his job as an editor of a highbrow literary magazine and banned
from airing his views publicly in China.
Like other prominent intellectuals, Bao is extremely forthright with his
views except on two issues. Asked how history might judge Deng Xiaoping, he
replies: 'I don't want to talk about that.' Asked whether he believes the
Communist party would be in control in the year 2000, he responds: 'Can you
ask me something else?'
But Bao adds that China will experience a 'big change' politically before
the end of the century. Among the more important legacies of the Tiananmen
episode has been the stimulus given to debate among intellectuals about the
fairly alien concept of human rights in Chinese political tradition.
Cui Wenhua, a philosophy teacher and author who wrote daringly on the
subject in his book Altar of Rights, published in China in 1988, believes
that economic freedoms will ultimately lead to renewed demands for greater
political freedom and an appreciation of individual rights.
A 'non-person' himself - he was suspended from his job as a teacher at
Beijing's Broadcasting Institute after the Tiananmen episode - Cui says a
loosening of the government's grip on people's lives in the economic sphere
was the 'first and most fundamental step' towards greater freedom. 'Sooner
or later the Chinese people will have to realise they have a say in Chinese
politics instead of taking orders from one emperor,' he declares.
These views may prove to be naive - the product of a unique moment in
China's political evolution - but there is no question that debate is
stirring on a whole range of issues. Among the more controversial is the
future and nature of the Communist party, which is likely to find itself
under increasing pressure, assuming that economic liberalisation is
accompanied by strengthening demands for political change.
'If the party has enough wisdom, it will change its Marxist character to be
more of a social democratic party,' observes Liu. 'The only way for the
Communist party to save itself is gradually to embrace reform and
democratisation. The only thing that can save the party is the party
itself.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Hounded out by fiction and foes: History will be kinder to
Norman Lamont than the tabloid press has been
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Lamont must go down as one of the unluckiest chancellors. I hope that
history will also see him as a brave man who took unpopular decisions in the
best interests of the country. It is no credit to our governance that he was
ultimately brought down by the mob, led on by the popular press.
When he took office in November 1990 the chancellor inherited a double-digit
rate of inflation, which he hated, and an economy moving rapidly into
recession. He decided to make the elimination of inflation his main policy
aim and in this he was outstandingly successful. The headline inflation rate
fell from nearly 11 per cent to just over 1 per cent during his stewardship.
But the price was high. The recession proved much longer and deeper than
mainstream forecasters had expected. A recovery, originally expected well
ahead of the April 1992 election, was still not in the bag by last
Christmas. In the meantime an alarming deterioration in the public finances
had become all too visible. A chancellor committed to cutting taxes had to
introduce a tax-raising budget.
It was, of course, none of these problems that brought him down. Everybody
will remember Norman Lamont as the man who had publicly defended an exchange
rate policy for which, as the cabinet's leading Euro-sceptic, he had little
affection, and then clung to office when the policy collapsed. He was filmed
on the Treasury steps in late August saying there was no scintilla of doubt
that the pound would stay in the ERM. Three weeks later, from a nearby spot,
he announced the suspension of ERM membership.
If he had gone then, the reasons for his departure would have been clear.
But his senior colleagues agreed that the ERM debacle was not his fault. He
stayed, and on balance I believe he was right to do so. Those who cite the
precedent of Jim Callaghan's resignation over the sterling devaluation of
1967 are drawing a distant and misleading parallel. They should look at what
other countries have done following the many realignment crises that have
dogged the ERM at roughly two-year intervals since its birth in 1979. They
have not found it necessary to change their finance ministers along with
their ERM parity.
Should Mr Lamont have ducked the fight to stay in? That would have been a
breach of faith with all in Britain who supported ERM entry and with
Britain's partners in the EC. Should he have devalued rather than float? The
countries which chose that option have had an uncomfortable time, with
interest rates still high and the risk of another realignment crisis never
far away.
By fighting to stay in until he was forced out, the chancellor sent a very
clear signal of his determination to defeat inflation with a strong pound
and high interest rates. He also underlined the government's commitment to
the ERM, keeping open the option of rejoining the system. That option seemed
more important then than now. But when re-entry comes back on the agenda, Mr
Lamont's dogged defence of sterling's ERM parity will stand us in good
stead.
Once out of the ERM Mr Lamont swiftly cut short-term interest rates,
bringing them decisively below German rates, as they needed to be. His
Autumn Statement contained further measures to bolster confidence, notably
the abolition of the car tax. The UK is now enjoying a recovery while the
rest of the Community is in deepening recession.
Mr Lamont also put in place a new framework for the conduct of policy. He
set, for the first time, an explicit inflation target, buttressed by
indicative ranges for broad and narrow money. He announced that progress on
inflation would be monitored in regular monthly meetings with the governor
of the Bank of England, on a pre-announced timetable. He ordered the
publication of the internal documents on which that assessment was based. He
also gave the Bank of England a new quasi-independent role in monitoring the
inflation performance and publishing a quarterly report on the subject.
The new policies were outlined, in a speech to the International Monetary
Fund, the weekend immediately after exit from the ERM. Over the next few
weeks further details were announced in a letter to the Treasury committee,
in the Mansion House speech and in the Autumn Statement. This measured pace
was considered too slow by some. But policies made on the hoof are followed
all too often by U-turns.
The verdict of the financial markets on all this is clear. The long bond
rate, the acid test of inflationary expectations, is more than 1 percentage
point lower than in September. The exchange rate has held steady.
So why did we keep on reading that the City had lost all confidence in the
chancellor? Perhaps it was because the tabloids turned on him. Having
hounded David Mellor out of office for some over-enthusiastic socialising in
a Chelsea strip, they attempted to bring down Mr Lamont by character
assassination. They produced a mischievous story about his party conference
hotel bill. They dug up another about his Access bill (lost when building
works drove him temporarily out of Number 11). They kept digging and found
that some of the costs of evicting an unsuitable tenant 18 months earlier
had been met out of public funds. Worst of all, when Lamont stopped at the
Marble Arch Threshers (on the way home from Dorney Wood) to pick up some
wine for dinner the incident was turned, by false witness, into a fictitious
purchase of champagne and cheap cigarettes in Paddington.
He survived it all and went on to present his third Budget - a delicate
balancing act. Public borrowing needed to be reduced but the recovery was
still very fragile. The chancellor solved the problem by announcing a
programme of delayed tax increases. The innovation received good reviews (as
had both of his previous Budgets) and the economic data published since then
suggest the economy is still on the path to recovery.
So during the Easter recess it looked as though, for once, all was set fair.
Growth had resumed; inflation, both prices and wages, was hitting record
lows; the problem of the public finances had been addressed. It was a fair
bet that Mr Lamont would present the first unified Budget, his fourth, and
bow out with honour shortly after.
Then came the Newbury by-election. The government suffered a huge defeat,
and suddenly the papers were again full of calls for the chancellor's
resignation. This time he lost the support of his closest colleagues and was
obliged to depart, to a gleeful tabloid chorus of 'Lamont humiliated'
headlines.
The departure of a cabinet minister is an important political event. It is
usually the result either of a scandal or a big disagreement within the
government over policy. Mr Lamont's departure does not fit that pattern. The
change of policy occurred nine months ago and has proved rather successful.
The scandals dominated the headlines six months ago, and were either
fictitious or not very scandalous.
The chancellor nevertheless had to go because word came back from Newbury to
the party managers that he was unpopular. The voters mentioned the hotel
bill, the Access bill, the lawyers' bill, the Threshers bill. Nobody
mentioned the Finance Bill. That reflects the coverage accorded to Mr Lamont
by the tabloids.
Politicians are judged by the quality of their decisions. Mr Lamont took
some good ones and leaves the economy in much better shape than he found it.
The history books will be kinder to him than his contemporaries have been.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: EC anti-dumping measures not in interests of
industrial efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PIERRE DIDIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Commission is currently reviewing a number of anti-dumping duties
imposed in the mid-1980s. The cases concern typewriters, electronic scales,
outboard motors, compact disc players and, possibly, printers. In practice,
the data show in each case the complaining industry is in a worse state
today than at the time of the original investigation.
Why are anti-dumping measures apparently so inefficient?
First, because there is clearly no alternative to free competition. Often,
while protected, the EC industry has delayed restructuring. Exporters have
compensated for duties by further rationalisation, or by relocating. In the
outboard motors case, floor prices since 1983 have kept EC prices some 40
per cent above US prices, yet the EC industry still complains about losses.
The Commission must bear a heavy responsibility for the failure of the
anti-dumping instrument. Artificially inflated dumping margins have led to
the feeling in Europe that foreign competition can be effectively fought
with heavy anti-dumping measures. But except in the case of existing
anomalies, this is to tackle the problem from the wrong end.
Some consider that the only way to cope with the failure of the 1985 duties
is to impose still tougher measures. Others, however, believe it is time to
replace these heavy instruments of trade policy with specific, time-limited
measures correcting market dysfunctions where they exist.
This presupposes, in the first instance, a return to the original meaning of
dumping under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - that is, the
private subsidising of cheap exports using profits achieved on the domestic
market. A neutral assessment of injury and, in particular, the causality
link between dumping and injury, is also needed. Procedural changes,
permanent assessment of the effects of the measure, greater transparency and
predictability are long overdue.
Only by making these changes will EC industry be protected from unfair
practices without being given the illusion of protection, which justifies
the postponement of restructuring. European industry should also consider
whether its interests are best served by imposing measures which are so
heavy that foreign competitors are forced to transfer production into the
Community.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: Lessons in competition law can be painful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs E SUSAN SINGLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a competition lawyer one becomes used to ignorance and disregard
among some sectors of the business community of laws regulating
anti-competitive agreements. 'Minding Your Own Business' (May 22/23)
profiled an individual selling up-market clothes.
Maintaining that he 'sticks rigidly to recommended retail prices' the
proprietor went on to state that he complains to suppliers when he discovers
any shop selling below RRP.
Furthermore, we were informed, 'one top label' (which remains nameless)
'stipulates that retailers must sell at a mark-up of 300 per cent - to
protect sales at its own shops'.
Not only could such an arrangement contravene the Resale Prices Act 1976 and
require prior registration with the Office of Fair Trading under the
Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, but it is likely also to infringe
Article 85(1) of the Rome treaty.
Whether the parties know or care, they should at least be warned of the
European Commission's powers to fine them up to 10 per cent of annual,
worldwide turnover, of the unenforceability of the resale price restrictions
and of the rights of third parties to bring actions for damages for loss
suffered through the operation of such arrangements.
In the face of such penalties, the bliss of ignorance - be it feigned or
otherwise - is quickly replaced through an expensive initiation into the
detail of competition law enforcement and penalties. E Susan Singleton,

THE STORY OF CHERNOBYL by Piers Paul Read Secker &amp; Warburg, 478 pages,
Pounds 16.99
Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear accident, is a tantalising target for a
writer. The events of the night of April 26 1986 were shrouded in
KGB-protected secrecy by the Soviet government for years, despite the
clamourings of other countries to know how the accident happened.
But as the Soviet Union disintegrated, the print-outs from the reactor's
computers, the tape recordings of the men in the control room, and the
medical records of the surrounding population gradually emerged. Chernobyl's
scientists and directors have also been increasingly prepared to talk to
foreign writers; many appear remorseful for having helped cover up the full
story. Piers Paul Read has interviewed two of the most senior staff in
control of the reactor that night: Victor Brukhanov, Chernobyl's director,
and Anatoli Dyatlov, deputy chief engineer.
By far the best part of the book is the account of the panic, terror and
extraordinary courage on the night of the explosion. Scientists and
technicians - who thought at first that war had broken out - streamed along
corridors in the dark as their instruments failed. They heaved at twisted
metal doors to reach the control rods and put their hands into radioactive
pools to turn safety valves. They slung injured colleagues over their
shoulders as they fled for the exits, even though the radioactivity from the
contaminated clothing burned deep sores into their flesh.
Read provides a powerful reminder, too, of the peculiarly horrible effects
of radiation on the human body, one of the reasons why western Europe's
environmental pressure groups are so fiercely opposed to nuclear power.
Thirty-one people died immediately or within days. They watched their own
bodies rot, their intestines dissolve and the skin on their legs fall down
like loose socks.
The book goes a long way to explaining how the disaster happened, pointing a
finger at the Soviet planning system. Components to build Chernobyl's four
reactors - secured after tortuous negotiations with the strangely named
Ministry of Medium Machine Building - rarely arrived in working order or on
time. The plant's directors, says Read, struggled to meet impossible
construction targets, while juggling Communist party demands to diversify
into consumer goods and to construct two hay barns for a local farm.
Locked into that system, Chernobyl's staff believed that initiative, even on
the brink of disaster, would be penalised. That led them to persist with an
experiment on the plant's electricity turbines even when it started to go
wrong - ironically, the reactor ran out of control during long-overdue tests
on its safety.
The book makes too much of the faultiness of the reactor's control rods,
although the imperfections were confirmed this year in a report by the
International Atomic Energy Authority, the nuclear watchdog. The
ill-designed safety tests and the generally poor standards of construction
were the main causes.
It also does little to solve the main remaining mystery of Chernobyl: how
many people were made ill, or saw their children born deformed. Read points
out, movingly, that figures are hard to establish because the general health
of the population is so poor, undermined by pollution and inadequate
nutrition. But he cites estimates - which range from the 31 who died to 'as
many as (in) the second world war' - without saying which should be taken
seriously.
This is a symptom of the book's biggest weakness. It relies heavily on
secondary sources - particularly Ukrainian and Russian newspaper reports -
and attributes too few of its main assertions to any identifiable source.
Important points lack substantiation, such as his claim that, before the
explosion, there was 'anxiety in the highest quarters about the shortcomings
in construction'. His fondness for the passive tense also leaves too many
questions dangling about who took critical decisions at the plant - the
identity of the person who ordered the go-ahead for evacuation of the town,
for example.
Surprisingly, given his talent as a novelist, the pace suffers from Read's
technique of retelling the events several times to reflect the different
perspectives of the plant's workers, the politicians and the local
residents. He also indulges in at least half a dozen repetitions of
passages, and in clumsy metaphors, although it is perhaps inevitable that
the glowing core of the destroyed reactor is compared to a glimpse of hell.
Unfortunately, towards the end, his prose not only describes but resembles
the ponderous and labyrinthine ways of the Soviet command economy.
That said, he is right that Chernobyl has become a powerful symbol. The
explosion has come to represent the atrophy of the Soviet Union and 'its
subsequent melt-down', as Read puts it. It is also seen as a turning point
in the promise of nuclear power to deliver cheap energy without much risk,
even in poorly managed countries.
Read's final suggestion - that human fallibility means nuclear power can
never be safe - seems unnecessarily fatalistic, however. The lessons of
Chernobyl are precise ones - the apparent impotence of United Nations bodies
such as the IAEA, and the way the nuclear industry's military connections
are frequently used to restrict information.
Western countries also have plenty of evidence now that there is a threat of
a second Chernobyl at some of the crumbling reactors in eastern Europe or
the former Soviet Union. They know that sending money, technicians and
components could reduce the risks. There is an argument, which Read does not
explore, that if another accident were to occur, the blame should fall on
the inadequacy of western action rather than on the innate dangers of
nuclear power.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: A better criterion for audit exemption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L D MCCLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a director of a small limited company I welcome the removal of the
audit requirement in principle ('Third time lucky' June 2). However, a
different exemption criterion would seem to be desirable.
In our case the accounts are computerised and audit fees are only about 0.7
per cent of turnover; the time required for meetings and dealing with minor
queries is of greater importance. Moreover, the audit process involves other
formalities such as bank letters; these cost Pounds 17-Pounds 20 each and
merely repeat information already provided on statements.
Unfortunately we would not benefit from the Department of Trade and Industry
proposal as our turnover is above the VAT threshold. The exemption would be
more effective if framed to cover the majority of limited companies which
obtain no advantage from the audit requirement.
Better targeting could be achieved by director certification subject to
unanimous approval by shareholders. Where credit rating agencies, banks or
other creditors need audited accounts it would not be in the interests of
directors or shareholders to claim the exemption.
An arrangement of this type would also have the advantage that companies
below the VAT limit (or any other arbitrary threshold) would not be entitled
to automatic exemption. The decision would be taken after weighing the costs
and benefits of an audit to the individual business.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your otherwise excellent article, 'In search of the private landlord'
(June 1), ignores the main reason why the private landlord will remain
'reluctant to revive the private rented sector'.
The landlords of long-term tenants are facing the prospect of losing their
properties under the provisions of this 'Conservative' government's urban
development and leasehold reform bill. Now the principle of expropriation is
established who can be sure future ministers, or indeed Sir George Young
himself, will not seek to enfranchise short-term tenants too? Once bitten,
twice shy.

Sir, We are amazed to find, having read the story 'Delors orders study into

there is no mention of the policy of high interest rate pursued by the
Bundesbank and followed by other European monetary system members.
We believe this policy to be one of the major, if not the major, cause of
unemployment in the EC. We believe including this subject into the study
would be rewarding.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Sweeney Todd - Musical theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Stephen Sondheim really is a minority taste: attempts to find a tape
or record of his original Sweeney Todd in London last weekend failed even at
shops that claim to have practically everything. Assassins flopped in New
York and the brilliant production at the Donmar Warehouse early last year
turned out to have only minority appeal.
Sweeney Todd was a limited success when it first played in London 13 years
ago, but suffered from the vast size of the Drury Lane Theatre. The Royal
National Theatre's revival goes to the other extreme and confines it to the
very small space of the Cottesloe, which will anger a lot of people because
there aren't many seats and most were sold in advance.
But apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the show? The answer is
that it is 90 per cent terrific. No company in Britain is likely to match
the RNT when it pulls out all the stops, which in this case include an
organ. As a programme note admits, not even the RNT could have deployed so
many resources without 'a lavish and inspired donation from the Mackintosh
Foundation'.
The cast includes a chorus which is there not mainly to sing. Most of the
time it simply moves, observes and registers reactions. This is wonderful
ensemble playing.
Aficionados will most admire the music in all its considerable variety. Some
of the scores and lyrics could not come from anyone but Sondheim. He has a
way of writing an eight-syllable line followed by one seemingly shorter;
sometimes he does it with a five then a four. Often he complements it with
an off-rhyme. Listen to the marvellous 'Do they think that walls can hide
you? Even now I'm at your window'. Sondheim is a complete master of this
form.
Then, just when he may be becoming predictable, he switches to another
style. You will pick up a lot of references to other musicals in Sweeney
Todd. The Johanna song, beautifully sung as the barber slits the throats,
reminds you of Maria in West Side Story. Mrs Lovett's jolly and romantic 'By
the Sea' stirs memories of 'The Surrey with the Fringe on Top' in Oklahoma.
And Sondheim feeds on himself. The 'Nothing's going to harm you' song in
Sweeney is close to his 'You are not alone' in his later Into the Woods.
At the Cottesloe, the musical star in a production where no one falls below
par is Adrian Lester as Anthony, the good friend to Sweeney. He has a voice
to which you could listen all night, but you can never overlook the support,
sometimes the virtuosity, of the nine-strong orchestra.
There is acting to go with it, comedy as well as melodrama. Here the star is
Julia McKenzie's Mrs Lovett, who has most of the best lines - 'the worst
pies in London' and 'just a couple of rats gone home to Jesus'. Alun
Armstrong's Sweeney is the hardest part of all because, for all his
butchering, he is simply a straight male lead. I don't think he quite
manages the shifts from the thirst for vengeance to becoming almost
respectable and back again. But perhaps the fault is in the writing. It is
not quite clear whether Sweeney is a hero or a villain. True, he can be a
bit of both, yet it is a question which Declan Donnellan's otherwise
admirable direction has not fully resolved.
The other slight failing is overdoing the macabre. The cannibalistic song at
the beginning of the second act where everyone munches the pies should be
omitted for reasons of taste as well as length. Others may object to the
mounting tide of blood. A whole bucket of it is poured down a drain at the
front of the stage, and when Judge Turpin is killed it spurts sideways like
a burst hose at full blast. There is a distinction between a desire to shock
and simply showing off.

Until recently the difficulty on Fridays was to decide which old movies to
watch. Now, all of a sudden, there is none. The only production billed as a
'film' tonight is an old American TV drama, Murder In The City Of Angels. It
was supposed to provide a series vehicle for George Peppard, playing a 1940s
policeman, but never got beyond this pilot (10.20 BBC1).
Dr Quinn: Medicine Woman should have been abandoned at the pilot stage, but
wasn't. Jane Seymour plays a doctor on the wild west frontier where everyone
else acts in a manner befitting the 1860s - parochial, masculinist, Indian
hating - while she expresses all the politically correct ideas of the 1980s.
Odd. (8.00 ITV).
BBC2 pilots another American series, Parenthood, which follows the fortunes
of four generations of the Buckman family and is, we are told, 'heart
warming'. This could be code for 'mawkishly sentimental'. Stand by for
something that makes 'Little House On The Prairie' look rigorous and
Tolstoyan (7.00). One Foot In The Past is a new series about 'the issues
that shape Britain's heritage' (9.30 BBC2).

FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Volpone - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By some strange fluke, there is a rush of Venetian premieres in the Midlands
this week, New productions of Jonson's Volpone at the Birmingham Rep, and at
Stratford-upon-Avon of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Goldoni's The
Venetian Twins. (Even Matthew Hart's new work for Birmingham Royal Ballet
featured Venetian blinds.) In several ways, Bill Alexander's Volpone staging
is a sequel to the Othello with which, in March, he launched his new
Birmingham Rep regime. And where does Act One of Othello take place? Venice,
city of intrigue, lawsuits and (in the Renaissance) finance.
Jonson's satirical farces are tight, neat, unromantic affairs, far from
Shakespeare's larger-spirited, more varied, ironic and lyrical comedies. As
long as you cut it judiciously, Volpone is a remarkably playable comedy, and
it adapts smartly to different stagings. This Volpone is as fine as Nicholas
Hytner's 1990 staging at the Almeida in London. Where Hytner evoked the
intimacy of Venice by having water swishing around the perimeters of the
small stage area, this one evokes the city's scale, with an arching bridge
looming high above the Rep's large stage. The designer, Kit Surrey, has
taken his basic Othello set - huge tiles lining floor and walls - and dyed
it brown and gold.
This production's skill lies in contrasting public and private scenes, in
telling the story with robust vitality, and in giving surprising comic
emphasis to several supporting characters. Corvino (Jamie Newall), whose
grossly misogynistic treatment of his wife Celia can be so disturbing, is
here a comic monster. The scenes involving Sir Politic Would-be and his wife
(all omitted by Hytner) are here made hilarious.
Everything is so lucid and onward-moving that it hardly matters that several
central roles are miscast. Or that Alexander has cut not only such songs as
Jonson's Catullus translation 'Come, my Celia, let us prove' but also
Volpone's three special minions - his dwarf, hermaphrodite and eunuch. Or
that Alexander and Surrey somewhat diminish the play by locating it (like
Jonathan Miller's Merchant of Venice) at the turn of the last century, with
cafe society, boaters, and frock coats.
Bernard Horsfall plays the title role like a skinny Falstaff - scurrilous,
lofty, urbane, an amusing still hub of the action, warmest when in in his
cups. But he is a Volpone/fox neither cunning nor predatory. He lacks the
acid for such remarks as 'women and men of every sex,' and he is too
obviously the passive dupe of the parasite fly, Mosca. In which role Gerard
Murphy is not just wrong - impossible to imagine him either buzzing or
flying - but also over-indulges all his worst hark-at-me mannerisms: the odd
back-of-the-mouth tone formation; the unspontaneous delivery of even so
simple a line as 'Do so'. By contrast, Andrea Mason's Celia is coarse and
under-refined, her elocution as weak as her maquillage is strong.
Yet these and other flaws hang light in the scales. I loved the detailed
ensemble playing in the big trial scene, the sense of Venetian open-air
chat, the vivid sweep of the whole satire. As in Othello, 20 extras help to
swell the big scenes. And Alexander's decision to bring the front of the Rep
stage right forward beyond the proscenium arch continues to pay dividends.
Stagings now project here so surely that I relish the whole balance of steep
auditorium and deep stage. In three months Alexander has made the Rep, whose
acoustic I used to dread, a theatre I look forward to revisiting.
Birmingham Rep until June 26

FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Capriccio and Meistersinger - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heil Hitler] Few operas served the Third Reich better than Capriccio and Die
Meistersinger von Nurnberg. Both were used to prove the health and strength
of German art, at the very hour when the seeds of Germany's wartime
destruction were being sown. Both have just been staged in Berlin in
productions which resonate with images of the Nazi era.
Strauss was given the idea for Capriccio by Stefan Zweig, the Jewish
librettist of Die schweigsame Frau. Prevented by the Nazis from
collaborating further, Zweig fled to Brazil, where he committed suicide
shortly before Capriccio was premiered in war-torn Munich. The opera was
completed with the help of Clemens Krauss, a known Nazi sympathiser  - but
it was an anachronism, the product of a composer who blinkered himself from
the world around him. Meistersinger was the ultimate paean to 'holy German
art', set in the very city which symbolised the rise and fall of the Nazi
master-race.
Plenty of scope for re-interpretation here, you might think. Turning great
works of theatre into a parable of the Nazi experience may be a cliche, but
it provokes a thoughtful response from German audiences. Occasionally it
illuminates. The programme books offered stimulating perspectives. But what
the performances bore out was that no two operas could be more remote from
the atmosphere of the 1940s.
Meistersinger at the Deutsche Oper suffers least, if only because Gotz
Friedrich leaves most of his production ideology where it belongs, on the
drawing board. He confines his moralising to the overture, flashing up an
image of Nuremberg in ruins - a grim 20th century symbol of the ills (Hans
Sachs's 'Wahn') that befall a society which succumbs to chauvinism and
democratic chaos.
For the rest of the evening, Nuremberg assumes a Biedermeyer setting of
around 1835 - when Wagner himself witnessed a riot there, and the Act two
finale of Meistersinger began to germinate. The central motif of Peter
Sykora's decor is a giant lens, with models of Nuremberg's town-houses
bunched along the bottom curve. A circular pane of patterned glass provides
the backdrop for Act one. Act two is a dingy townscape of prefabricated
boxes - lacquered, like all Sykora's designs, in unremitting Prussian blue.
The Festwiese could have been an aircraft hangar or a sports hall, with the
chorus ranked on stands tucked away in the wings.
Not a glimmer of Romanticism - nor much humour, which never was Friedrich's
strong suit. On the credit side, the character-quirks of the mastersingers
are beautifully etched, and the Act one singing trial is a delight.
Beckmesser, sung by Eike Wilm Schulte without a hint of caricature or
vulgarity, is a tragi-comic figure more interested in Pogner's money than
his daughter. Pogner is majestically brought to life by Jan-Hendrik
Rootering. Wolfgang Brendel, in an extremely promising role-debut, portrays
Sachs as a well-coiffed, clean-shaven young philosopher-cobbler, and the
voice carries handsomely. Eva Johansson was the delectably plump Eva, Paul
Frey a frayed-at-the-edges Walther. The Act three quintet was one of the
best I've heard.
That reflected well on the Deutsche Oper's new music director, Rafael
Fruhbeck de Burgos. He secured clean, sensitive playing from the orchestra.
The performance was brisk and unfussy. All it lacked was a sense of pathos.
Much the same could be said for Hartmut Haenchen's conducting of Capriccio
at the Staatsoper unter den Linden. The rich textures of Strauss's orchestra
were eloquently unravelled, the singers never covered. Yvonne Kenny's debut
as Countess Madeleine was an unqualified success. She looked gracious,
elegant, pretty, never sounding less than confident and comfortable. Also
outstanding was Siegfried Vogel, a magisterial La Roche. Other characters
were barely sketched, and - apart from Rosemarie Lang's Clairon - undersung.
Jonathan Miller's production, designed by Peter Davison and Sue Blane, was
set in a bombed-out Munich rehearsal hall. Before a note was heard, the cast
and attendants gathered on stage to the sound of a German wartime news
broadcast (complete with the war-theme from Liszt's Les Preludes). After the
sound faded, Strauss's serene string sextet started up and the 'rehearsal'
began in period costume.
The performance was clumsily staged and littered with unnecessary ideas. At
the final curtain, the sight and sound of an allied air raid loomed through
the crumbling back wall, and the cast reassembled to watch in silence. The
only authentic touch missing from this crass, charmless setting was the cry
of Heil Hitler]

FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Return of the big Mak - Deanna Petherbridge visits the
Austrian Museum of Applied Arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEANNA PETHERBRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mak - big Mak, new Mak, wonder Mak - has just re-opened in Vienna after
extensive refurbishing. Mak is the acronym for the Austrian Museum of
Applied Arts and, inspired by radical concepts of museum presentation, 11
artists have been brought in to design the new gallery installations. The
results are daring, controversial and beautiful.
This is the latest in a series of museum and historic building renovations
(the Albertina is the next in line) which have returned Vienna to a state of
magnificence. Mak, however, is not just a refurbished building but an
innovative and informed response to the big museum question: how to make a
historic collection relevant to present day concerns.
Originally named the 'Austrian Museum for Art and Industry' in 1864, the
museum was modelled on London's Victoria and Albert Museum and housed in a
custom-designed neo-Renaissance building on the Stubenring. As well as its
magnificent furniture, woodwork, glass and ceramics it has valuable Islamic
and East Asian art and carpets and a large library and archive, including
that of the Wiener Werkstatte. Since the appointment of Peter Noever as
director in 1986, contemporary exhibitions and installations by
international artists have made this one of Vienna's liveliest venues.
Magdalena Jetelov, some years ago filled the decaying central courtyard with
mounds of red sand as if the museum were adrift in a desert and Vito Acconci
is now exhibiting a grand and intriguing installation, 'The City Inside Us',
which subverts the architectural language of the building - an often
unsubstantiated claim of installation artists.
'Mak intends to play its part as a responsible social institution in the
formation of cultural values,' writes Noever in the new museum guide. Part
of reconstituting such values was to invite contemporary artists to
collaborate with curators in the selection and re-presentation of the
collection rather than to use architects.
The notion of Donald Judd, high priest of minimalism, making an installation
of ornate Baroque, Rococo and Classical furniture and objects might seem
bizarre, and Judd's catalogue statement reveals some uneasiness.
Nevertheless his placing of a few carefully chosen pieces of baroque
furniture and decorative panels within a vast marbled space is seductive and
frees the spectator to enjoy the period elaboration of each piece away from
associated clutter. Judd's dialectic of opposites - more wrapped within less
 -finds central expression in the the free-standing room within a room, the
18th-century porcelain chamber from the Dubsky Palace in Brno, whose glowing
rococo interior is encased within a cool stucco exterior. The gallery is
topped with its original skylight by the 19th-century architect Heinrich von
Ferstel, and the cleaned neo-Renaissance surround also gains richness in
this clear aestheticised space. All 11 gallery installations depend on a
high degree of selectivity, but Judd's presentation highlights a dilemma.
Most contemporary museums, with rarefied displays of a few objects, rotate
them. But with intervention from artists, the choice of objects is
presumably sacrosanct and unchangeable. However, each gallery has a study
room for the visitor who wants to explore further.
The limitation of choice is avoided in the Wiener Werkstatte gallery
designed by Viennese sculptor Heimo Zobernig with curator Elisabeth
Schmuttermeier, which presents the museum's entire holdings. The artist has
designated the gallery space as a simple spatial geometry of orange, white
and grey/black (colours associated with the movement), reflecting the
underlying geometric impulse of the 1903 design workshop of Josef Hoffman
and his partners. The workshop archive (including designs on paper, fabric
samples, photographs and model books) is arranged in a double level of
shelved cupboards along one wall, and decorative objects are exhibited in an
array of historic display cabinets.
In the 'Historicism and Art Nouveau' gallery, New York artist Barbara Bloom
shows Thonet bentwood chairs to witty advantage by placing them in two rows
down the sides of the long gallery, behind translucent screens. The chairs'
sinuous curves are projected on to the screens as linear shadows, and the
spectator, viewing either the chair or its typical silhouette is encouraged
to bridge that sometimes difficult-to-grasp gap between two-dimensional
design and object, between the conceptual and the experiential.
American 'hot property' Jenny Holzer has been let loose on the Biedermeier
and Empire style gallery with curator Christian Witt-Dorring. This has not
turned into a subversion of 19th-century bourgeois values, as the original
architecture marries all too cosily with furniture from its own time.
However there is something discomforting about the array of heterogeneous
furniture dispiritedly displayed along the terracotta walls and in a line
down the centre of the gallery, which challenges standard notions of museum
theatrics.
The difficult dynamics of super-selectivity rather than encyclopaedic
display are seen to best advantage in the '20th-century design and
architecture' gallery, designed by Viennese sculptor Manfred Wakolbinger
with Peter Noever as curator. Contemporary chairs, including Frank Gehry's
1988 witty corrugated cardboard 'Hole in One' chair, architectural models,
drawings and a room installation by Jasper Morrison (part fictive, part
real), are given real and psychological space in this gallery, stylistically
a sort of insouciantly minimal post-modernism.
In Mak's visual world, so carefully articulated in relation to history and
contemporary critical debates, there are no insuperable boundaries between
Austrian and international artists, between high and low art, scholar and
artist, maker and curator. The museum presents a Utopian moment which has
come at a very interesting juncture in Austria's cultural and geographic
reconstitution. It remains to be seen whether the public will forego the
joys of traditional serendipity for such sophisticated games.

A wealth of business and financial information can be accessed from any UK
telephone socket through a new interactive communications system, writes Ian
Holdsworth.
Up to 45 services, including information on share prices in Dublin and
London, credit ratings and company reports from Dun &amp; Bradstreet and hotel
and travel bookings, are available from the Network North system, a joint
venture between ICL and Belfast-based CFM computer services.
The network, accessed through a small terminal which plugs into a phone
point, also offers telebanking and teleshopping. Developed with help from
British Telecom Northern Ireland, it can link into similar systems in other
European countries.
Terminals cost Pounds 7.50 a month to rent. They can be bought for Pounds
120 in Northern Ireland with an EC subsidy or Pounds 240 in the rest of the
UK. Network subscription is up to Pounds 40 a year and most services are
charged at 6-15p per minute. Software to convert a PC into a network
terminal costs Pounds 25. Network North: UK, 0265 848962.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology: Grime removed from Michelangelo's frescoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE of work by Vatican restorers has removed nearly five centuries of
ancient and modern grime from Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel,
writes Andrew Baxter.
But now that the frescoes are clean, how can they be kept so when subjected
to the breath and body heat of 2m visitors each year? Today, Pope John Paul
II officially accepts the answer - a completed air treatment system for the
Sistine Chapel from William Frago, president of Carrier, the world's largest
air conditioning manufacturer.
Years of research by Carrier of the US and the Vatican's own experts have
gone into designing a system that is effective and discreet. Temperature and
air flow studies indicated that warm, moist air was rising up towards the
ceiling every morning as doors opened and visitors flowed in. The warm air
spread across the ceiling, then cooled and descended, leaving behind
moisture and dirt on the frescoes. Excessive moisture would encourage the
growth of mould and the formation of salt deposits.
The solution, therefore, was to install a system that provided a clean,
stable microclimate for the frescoes. Control of relative humidity is the
most important aim, because large swings allow water movement into and out
of the plaster. Minimising overall temperature differences reduces expansion
and contraction of the fresco material.
A Carrier air handling unit delivers fresh air which has been filtered,
washed and processed before entering the Chapel through diffusers under the
south windows, about 15m up. These create two air flows, one of low velocity
which flows over the surface of the frescoes, and a second which effectively
bathes visitors with a 'shower' of clean air at floor level, where the air
is extracted. The windows will remain closed to Rome's noise and pollution.
Two computer terminals, one in the Vatican's energy centre and the other
with the restoration scientists, allow information from the system to be
stored and evaluated, to ensure the frescoes retain their new-found sparkle.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology: Teeing off with virtual golf - Japan's players
are competing on screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's golf lovers cannot seem to get enough of the game, despite the high
prices and traffic jams they must bear to indulge their passion.
Technology, however, has stepped in to take some of the trouble away for the
avid golfer intent on conquering his favourite course complete with lakes,
trees and bunkers.
The Tour Simulator golf machine developed by Mizuno, a Japanese sports goods
company, recreates a round of golf on famous courses, taking the player from
starting tee to finishing green with the help of a screen, two computers,
cameras and a laser disc player. The system can be set up in any room big
enough to allow four players to hit a golf ball against the 3m-high canvas
screen.
The game starts with the players choosing one of the courses Mizuno has
captured on laser disc in 3,600 photographic images, or 200 photographs per
hole.
A long-distance view of the course comes on screen. Players choose how many
holes they want to play, the tee position and even the speed and direction
of the wind they prefer to battle against.
When the first hole comes on screen a voice describes the hole and offers
advice on how best to tackle it. After the player has hit the ball, it is
shown on the screen as it flies through the air and lands somewhere on the
fairway.
For the visual representation of the ball's flight, the screen uses data
provided by a computer which has calculated exactly how and where the ball
would have flown, depending on the strength and angle of the player's
stroke.
When the player hits the ball, his swing is photographed by two cameras
using high-speed shutters. One of the cameras is set up to the side of the
player to capture the speed and angle of the ball while the other camera is
fixed to the ceiling and captures the direction of the ball from above.
A microphone on the ground by the tee alerts the camera as the player hits
the ball and triggers a high-speed strobe light which flashes several times
per second. The multiple images that are captured are then sent to an image
interpreter connected to a computer.
The computer analyses the speed of the ball and the distance travelled. It
then tells with the laser disc player (which stores images of the golf
course) where the ball should have landed based on data such as the angle at
which the ball was hit, the speed and direction of the ball, and the chosen
speed and strength of the wind.
Using that data, the laser disc player chooses a view of the golf course
where the ball should have landed and projects it on to the screen.
The distance to the hole and the player's score up to that point are given
on the screen.
There are other treats such as contours that faithfully recreate each
particular green on the chosen course and a movable tee to simulate the
difficulty of hitting a ball that has landed in the rough.
If the ball should, according to the computer's calculations, have landed in
the lake, the screen image and sound of splashing water will recreate that,
too.
The system uses conventional 16-bit computers with software developed
specially by Mizuno's engineering and development department, a division of
the company which also developed shoes for the athlete Carl Lewis.
Mizuno engineers took a year to develop the virtual golf system, which costs
Y13m (Pounds 78,000) and has been installed in 40 places throughout the
country. Similar systems have been developed by other manufacturers.
But virtual golf is not a Japanese idea. It was thought up in the US by
Ingolf of California to enable golfers to practise swings in their garages.
Ingolf, also active in Japan, now plans to link up its indoor golfing plazas
around the world by satellite and computer networks so that teams can play
each other.
Considering the size of the average Japanese home, the next high-tech hit in
Japan might be a virtual American home.

FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Nomura International replaces its president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nomura International, which has experienced a difficult year with the flop
of the GPA flotation as well as hefty staff reductions at the end of last
year, sees its president, Taizo Kondo, moving to Hong Kong and replaced by
his deputy, Takashi Tsutsui.
Nomura stresses the shift is routine, part of the rotation of senior
executives, and that it 'would be a mistake' to make any connection with the
GPA fiasco, in which Nomura acted as global co-ordinator in the aborted
Dollars 800m issue. 'He has done his normal tour of duty,' a spokesman
added.
But it has been a tough year for the London end of Japan's largest
securities house. Unofficial estimates of results for the year ended March
1993 published on Wednesday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper say Nomura
International lost Y6.55bn (Dollars 60.8m), after a Y1.18bn (Dollars 11m)
profit in the previous 12 months.
Kondo, 44, moved to London in 1989 as deputy managing director of Nomura
International. He became president in March 1991, when he also joined the
main board of parent Nomura Securities.
Meanwhile, co-president John Howland-Jackson stepped down in January to join
NatWest Markets. Nomura says it is looking outside the organisation for a
senior European executive to replace him.
Tsutsui, 43, deputy president since early last year, has been in London
since mid-1991. Unlike Kondo, he is not yet a board member of Nomura
Securities.
Kondo's new job is as head of the Asia and Oceania division. Whilst outside
observers questioned whether this represented a promotion, Nomura responded
that the position entailed responsibility for a geographically larger, and
considerably more profitable, area of the group.

FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Pennell takes on the privatisation of British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever problems Christopher Pennell faces as the new head of privatisation
at British Coal he will not have to spend much time getting to know his
opposite numbers in the Department of Trade and Industry and at Samuel
Montagu, British Coal's advisers,
Pennell, 45, was educated at Oxford as was Peter Loughead, 42, head of the
coal privatisation unit at the DTI. Meanwhile, Pennell did a stint as
principal private secretary to former National Coal Board chairman Lord
Ezra, as did Peter Jones, 39, who is now on the Samuel Montagu team.
Compared with his last job of looking after British Coal's Pounds 1bn-a-year
purchasing budget, Pennell's new privatisation unit is very small. Instead
of 1,100 staff he will have just five people working with him, although he
will be calling on the resources of the rest of the corporation. The two
other key British Coal officials are Ian Forrest, 45, and David Merrick, 45.
All three men are British Coal veterans, as is Ray Proctor, 48, British
Coal's new finance director, who will retain overall responsibility for
privatisation at board level.
Pennell, who will split his time between his base at Eastwood Hall in
Nottingham and British Coal's London headquarters, divides his new job into
three sections. The first, and 'most pressing' part is to deal with the 20
collieries that are being closed down and offered for sale. Four collieries
have been advertised already and Pennell's team will look after the
tendering process.
The second part of Pennell's job will be to see whether it is possible to
privatise any stand-alone parts of British Coal ahead of full privatisation.
But the main part of Pennell's job will be to drive British Coal's side in
the government's planned privatisation. The difference here is that it will
be the government, and not British Coal, which is the vendor.
Unlike other nationalised industries that were privatised, such as British
Telecom, Pennell does not think there is much chance that British Coal will
be floated on the stock market. He believes it is more likely that it will
be privatised through a trade sale of all or parts of the business.

FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Scottish Office servant to head Whisky Association
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scotch Whisky Association, which spends most of its time lobbying the
British and other governments on behalf of the Scotch whisky industry, is
appointing Hugh Morison, a senior civil servant at the Scottish Office, as
its new director-general. He will succeed Bill Bewsher, who has been
director general for 21 years, when he retires at the end of the year.
Morison, 49, is currently under-secretary at the Scottish Office Industry
Department, concerned mainly with assisting Scottish companies.
As with other officials who have made their way up the Scottish Office, he
has worked in several of its departments. But, he says, he has got a 'real
buzz' recently from dealing with the private sector. He decided to join the
SWA when he learned that, in his next Scottish Office post, he would not
deal with economic issues.
Morison is a Scot though he was born in Bognor Regis: 'My family was part of
the Scottish diaspora.' He was a non-executive director of Weir Group, the
Glasgow-based engineering company, under the scheme whereby civil servants
and private sector companies are encouraged to become better acquainted.
Bewsher, his predecessor, has combined the doggedness of a lobbyist with a
gift for getting on with almost everyone, from the gentry (of which he is a
member) downwards.
While Bewsher has run the SWA, it has won cases in the European Court of
Justice against France, Italy, Denmark, Ireland and Greece over
discriminatory treatment of whisky. In 1987 it achieved a GATT ruling
against Japan's highly protectionist spirits regime. The whisky industry, he
argues, needs someone 'who knows at first hand the machinery of government'.

FT  04 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Uphill battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's consultation paper on commercial property leases underlines
the complexity of the arguments surrounding upward-only rent reviews.
'There is little firm information to enable the claims and counter-claims to
be thoroughly assessed,' the paper states.
The paper, which was published last week, states that there is no likelihood
of any legislation being passed that would affect existing leases.
But it acknowledges the pressure for reform. 'These criticisms (of
upward-only rent review clauses) have grown sharply in recent years as
clauses have operated to maintain rents above open market rents during the
recession,' it says.
The options for reform range from taking no action to prohibiting the use of
upward-only rent reviews. There are also some intermediate possibilities,
such as allowing rents to move upwards or downwards on review, providing the
rents never fall below the initial rent.
The paper's main criticisms of upward-only reviews are:
Landlords are in a strong bargaining position when there is a limited supply
of suitable property. This prevents tenants from freely negotiating their
leases and forces them to take on an unreasonable share of the risk inherent
in holding property.
In periods of recession and low inflation, tenants with existing leases are
locked into higher rents than tenants taking new leases. In these
circumstances, the market is unable to react to signals. Moreover,
upward-only reviews may be inflationary if tenants are able to pass the
costs of their high overheads on to consumers.
The upward-only rent reviews inhibit free choice because they may make it
difficult for tenants to assign their leases when rents are falling. They
may also lead to a higher level of insolvencies among tenants.
Since upward-only rent review clauses limit the risk to investors, they may
divert resources awayfrom other sectors of the economy.
The arguments in defence of upward-only rent reviews are:
Upward-only rent reviews have become a standard feature because they serve
the interests of the market as a whole. They strike a balance between the
risk of the landlord and his financial backers on one hand, and tenants on
the other. Rather than being inflationary, upward-only rent reviews may
allow rents to be set lower than they would otherwise be because of the
value of the clause to landlords. By reducing market uncertainty they may
also restrain rents and so stimulate investment and supply.
Any statutory regulation would inhibit the free operation of the market.
Abolition of upward-only rent review clauses might hit capital values, which
would be inequitable; such a move would also be deflationary as it would
reduce the value of collateral against which banks lend.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Management: Time for Cadbury to tackle high pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS spring gives way to summer, British bosses usually breathe a sigh of
relief. The flood of annual reports becomes a trickle, ending the now
customary 'open season' for attacks on newly disclosed top pay rises.
Company directors look forward to six months of gold-plated peace.
But 1993 may prove far less comfortable. This is not just because lower
company performance seems to have given more than a quarter of them smaller
bonuses, or none at all. Far more painful is that the pay controversy has
ceased to preoccupy merely the meddlesome but ephemera-minded media.
Instead, institutional shareholders are suddenly up in arms. From having
always turned a blind eye, or cursed quietly behind the scenes, a bunch of
activist institutions has burst noisely into public view. They were on TV
last Sunday, demanding an end to various abuses and to the lax and over-long
executive contracts which help create them.
Until recently, most representatives of the business world, other than the
outspoken new head of the Institute of Management, were equally reticent.
Then came last month's remarkable assault on his fellow bosses by Sir Owen
Green, for decades one of the UK's most respected chairmen. He attacked them
for 'awarding themselves huge pay rises', no matter how well or badly their
company performs - or how small a rise they give to the rest of their staff.
Inevitably, Sir Owen's onslaught has lent weight to misguided media
criticism of almost any sizeable pay rise, however well justified. Obvious
examples include the promotional increases announced in May for the new
heads of de-merged ICI and Zeneca.
But in many cases the general opprobrium is well justified. Take the string
of over-the-top pay-offs to failed executives which have been disclosed in
recent weeks, to the fury of reformist institutions.
Then there was the golden 'hello again' for Gerald Ronson: an absurdly
generous five-year contract worth Pounds 4.4m for the head of the
receivership-threatened property group - fresh from his ignominious part in
the Guinness affair, for which he was imprisoned and fined Pounds 5m.
Institutional ire was stoked by the fact that the deal was approved by a
bunch of supposedly upstanding banks and accounting firms.
Just as questionable and illuminating of the inadequacy of British corporate
governance over such matters, was the ultra-generous pension enhancements
and consultancy deal given to the recently retired - and highly respectable
 -head of Guinness.
It was piquant, to say the least, to see these arrangements being defended
at the annual shareholders meeting last week by no less a figure than the
former chairman of Rolls Royce Motors, who heads the committee of
non-executive directors which sets executive pay levels at Guinness.
Remuneration committees dominated by non-execs have been touted by the
establishment for years as the answer to pay abuses in British boardrooms.
But how can anyone seriously have faith in a system where one highly-paid
baron, no matter how respected, sits in judgment on another?
Which brings us to the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. Though its
Code of Practice takes effect on July 1, its work is far from done. Through
a sub-committee which will meet to monitor compliance with the Code, it has
the muscle to issue further 'recommendations' whenever it likes over the
next two years.
In order to foster outside support for the rest of its Code last year, the
Committee pulled its punches on pay. This was in spite of pressure from
certain institutions and some of its members, to have directors' pay made
subject to shareholder vote. It hid behind the argument that it did not see
'how these suggestions could be made workable'. What would happen if
someone's package were voted down? And wouldn't executives be reluctant to
join the company if approval were uncertain?
These excuses were always feeble. The new force of outside pressures means
the Committee can now abandon them. It has no choice but to do so if it
wishes to anticipate, and avoid, what its chairman called last Sunday 'the
heavy hand of regulation'.
As soon as possible, Cadbury should adopt this agenda:
Clarify that its recommended three-year limit on service contracts excludes
rolling ones. Better still, reduce the term to two.
Make its call last year for 'full disclosure' mean what it says by borrowing
the new formula of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This requires
the disclosure, in great detail, of each element of the 'compensation
package' of the five highest-paid executives; Cadbury requires far less data
and about only the chairman and one other.
Submit each person's package to shareholder vote. If this year's US
experience is anything to go by, few packages would cause problems. Instead,
companies would be forced to do their homework carefully in advance,
tailoring packages within bounds of acceptability laid down by institutional
shareholders, either in direct discussion or via specialist consultants -
whose business is now booming in America.
In such an environment, only the most crass of top managers would be loath
to join a company before their packages were approved.
If, through poor anticipation or oversight, the occasional package was voted
down, the executive concerned would revert to his or her previous year's
arrangements - or be put on an equivalent of the UK Inland Revenue's
emergency tax coding.
Impractical? Unfeasible? You can bet your last half million pounds that a
government regulator would find a way. So can Cadbury.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Management: Breaking the executive mould - Andrew Taylor
examines Eurotunnel's plans for a common corporate culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Peter Randall was a British Rail depot manager at Slade Green
near Dartford, Kent. His experience of France was limited to the occasional
holiday and a French O-level.
Today, aged 33, he commutes weekly from his home near Folkestone in Kent to
Calais in northern France where he is the Eurotunnel manager responsible for
day-to-day maintenance of the company's wagon and locomotive fleet. Next
year, when the tunnel operator finally starts running train services between
Britain and France, he will be responsible for a staff of 160, most of them
French.
Quite apart from its continuing headaches dealing with combative contractors
and nervous banks, one of the big challenges for Eurotunnel at the moment is
to mould Randall and other senior managers into a new breed of cross-Channel
executive. Eurotunnel's workforce is split evenly between British and French
workers with different languages, cultures and lifestyles - but when it
comes to senior jobs the group is anxious not to be overly influenced by a
candidate's background.
Yves-Noel Derenne, Eurotunnel's director of human resources, says: 'The aim
is not to recruit a particular nationality for a particular post, but to get
the right person for the job, whether they be British, French, German or
from some other country. There will be some jobs, however, which we would
expect to be filled by one nationality rather than another. The servicing of
rolling stock (because this is based in France) would naturally fall into
this category. Headquarters for security, on the other hand, will be based
in Britain.'
Not all jobs will divide so evenly. Engine drivers taking the 50km journey
between the British and French terminals will be expected to be bi-lingual
and will be drawn from both countries. Traffic controllers will also need to
be fluent in English and French. The main control tower will be at
Folkestone, but with a back-up in France. Staff working on a rota will
switch regularly between Britain and France.
Even at the top - where national sensitivities are often greatest - the
company has tried to choose the best people for the job. Among the five
senior executive directors there are admittedly two Frenchmen and two
Britons - one of whom, chief executive Sir Alastair Morton, was raised in
South Africa - but Frank Cain, on secondment from engineering group Bechtel
to run the construction side, is American.
Eurotunnel's workforce, small during the construction phase, is growing
rapidly and currently stands at 900, more than double that of a year ago.
Eventually this will rise to 2,650 of which more than 90 per cent will be
drawn from Britain and France. A small number of mostly sales staff will be
based in other European countries.
Alain Bertrand, Eurotunnel's chief executive in charge of transport
operations, says: 'We do not want a competitive culture to develop, Britain
versus France. Unlike other bi-national or multi-national companies, which
have separate management operations in different countries, we supply a
single service irrespective of which country the customer comes from.
'It is important, therefore, that we establish a single management structure
and corporate culture in which safety and customer service are the main
driving force rather than nationalism.'
The ability to provide information to customers is very important: 'All
employees in contact with customers will have the equivalent of at least two
weeks of language training,' says Bertrand.
The aim will be to provide them with the basic phrases to cope with their
job rather than speak fluent English or French. Staff who want to improve
further their language skills or switch from one country to another will be
encouraged.
Language training is more intense for managers or engineers who need to be
able to converse freely in English and French. Some of these are sent to
live with English or French families while they attend intensive language
courses for up to four weeks at a cost of Pounds 1,100 a week including
accommodation.
Language is just one problem: 'There are different laws and cultures
affecting employees in Britain and France,' says Derenne. 'Some
multi-national companies adopt the laws of whichever country they happen to
be operating in. This is not feasible or desirable for us. We have decided
to adopt a common corporate policy based on a combination of British and
French laws, whichever works to the best advantage of employees.
'French companies, for example, are expected to establish works councils,
comprised of workers representatives and management, to discuss problems and
improvements for staff. Eurotunnel has decided to establish a group-wide
works council covering both French and British workers,' says Derenne.
Cultural differences, of course, will not be so easy to reconcile. As
Randall points out: 'Britons like to go out for a drink after work. The
French by comparison like to go home to their families first and may go out
later.'
In other respects, though, it will probably be a question of getting used to
local custom.
Management in France, he says, tends not to advertise posts internally as is
done in many British companies. Instead they will just promote the person
they think most suitable for the job. But the result in most cases is the
same.
Despite these cultural and sometimes procedural differences, Randall says
that most of the problems brought to him are similar to those he faced when
a depot manager at Slade Green.
'Staff want to know how much they will be paid, what holiday entitlement
there is, what are the promotional opportunities and what happens when they
are sick?'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Extension of loan regulation urged: OFT backs move on credit
to small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDING to small businesses by banks and other financial services companies
should be licensed under the Consumer Credit Act, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. The aim was to ensure that
such lending was done fairly.
Sir Bryan said there was a case for extending to small incorporated
businesses the level of statutory protection for loans of up to Pounds
15,000 now given to individual borrowers under the 1974 act.
However, Sir Bryan rejected proposals from the Department of Trade and
Industry to impose further restrictions on credit marketing and said he
believed regulation under the 1974 act should be simplified.
Disclosing the initial results of an OFT review, Sir Bryan said he favoured
amendments to non-statutory rules to ensure that consumers were protected
from unscrupulous traders. He said the Banking Code of Practice, which is
being reviewed by a committee of the British Bankers' Association, should
include a 'best advice' provision to ensure that customers were advised
correctly on the choice between deposit accounts and insurance-based
products.
The code should also require banks and building societies to give fair
advice when counselling customers on choosing a repayment mortgage or an
endowment mortgage on which the organisation stood to gain an insurance
commission.
Sir Bryan, speaking to a Building Societies Association conference in
Brighton, said most of the government's proposals made in December 1990 to
extend restrictions on credit marketing should 'not be taken forward'. There
was 'significant scope for deregulation' by simplifying provisions of the
act, he said. This would then enhance the credit licensing system as a tool
to ensure high standards.
Sir Bryan said after his speech that he believed there was little logic in
loans of up to Pounds 15,000 to unincorporated small businesses being
subject to the act while similar loans to incorporated companies were not
regulated.
He believed many such businesses would benefit from the act because they
were relatively unsophisticated. 'Many of them are just a man or a woman
running a shop who were not expert in the ways of credit,' he said.
The act restricts the terms under which personal loans and overdrafts can be
advertised. It also requires lenders to provide information on the annual
percentage charge (APR) for loans.
Sir Bryan faced criticism from the head of the largest independent financial
adviser in the country over his recent report suggesting that the
non-disclosure of commissions attached to life insurance products restricts
competition.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society,
told the conference that proposals for independent financial advisers could
'lead to the virtual disappearance' of such advice.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Service industries gain in Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER plc, the notional 'company' created by combining the results of
the top 100 companies by turnover in greater Manchester, seems to have
weathered the recession with increased turnover, profitability, investment
and tighter cost control.
But the results seemed to present a rosier picture than the reality,
according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. Its analysis of the 26
new entrants in the top 100 revealed a substantial reconstruction of the
local economy, with a steady shift from manufacturing to service industries.
Strongest net growth was found in the retail, food, leisure and media
sectors.
However, the level of turnover of the 100th company remained unchanged,
indicating that new entrants made the list through sales growth.
The analysis showed overall sales growth of nearly 5 per cent to Pounds
26.87bn following 3 per cent the previous year.
Pre-tax profits were nearly 17 per cent up at Pounds 1.42bn, yielding 10.2
per cent on capital employed compared with 9.5 per cent the previous year.
The recession still bit, however: the combined operating profit margin rose
from 5 per cent to 5.6 per cent - well below the late 1980s peak of 9.1 per
cent. Fixed-asset investment levels were maintained at Pounds 1.2bn for the
past two years. But long-term liabilities rose 15 per cent and long-term
loans 20 per cent.
Pay per employee in the 100 companies averaged Pounds 11,210 compared with
Pounds 10,695 a year before. Employees in the leisure and media sectors were
the best paid and those in manufacturing the worst.

THE SURGE in house prices recorded earlier this year was thrown into reverse
last month, Halifax Building Society said yesterday. Its report raised
further doubts about the strength of the UK's economic recovery.
Halifax, Britain's largest building society, said average prices fell in May
by 1.2 per cent, the largest monthly fall for nine months. Prices had risen
1.4 per cent in March and 1.7 per cent in April.
The picture conflicts with figures earlier this week from Nationwide, the
second-biggest society, which said average house prices rose 1 per cent in
May, the third consecutive monthly increase.
Halifax emphasised, however, that monthly price falls can be expected at
this stage in the housing cycle. It said the market continued to display
signs of gradual recovery, with prices 'set to move on to a generally rising
trend over the next few months'.
Evidence of a more buoyant picture is also starting to be reflected in
housing land prices. A surge of buying interest among housebuilders has
triggered reported price rises of up to 30 per cent on certain development
sites in recent weeks. Rising houses sales are encouraging some builders
short of land to begin rebuilding their land banks.
Average house prices - now 3.3 per cent below May 1992 - are expected by
Halifax to end 1993 slightly higher than at the start of the year, with a
stronger recovery becoming more obvious in 1994. It stressed that realistic
prices continue to be necessary to generate sales.
Prices of new houses appear to be strengthening at a faster rate than for
the market as a whole, according to Halifax figures.
They rose 0.2 per cent in May and stood 0.8 per cent higher than a year
earlier, the first time the annual rate of new house price inflation has
been above zero since October 1990. Prices paid by first-time buyers stayed
weaker.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Curb advances above 90%, societies told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES will be encouraged not to lend more than 90 per cent of
the value of properties and to be more cautious about borrowers' ability to
repay loans under Building Societies Commission proposals disclosed
yesterday.
Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the industry's regulatory commission, said
societies were likely to have to set aside additional capital to cover the
risk of lending more than 90 per cent of the value of properties.
Mrs Gilmore also told the Building Societies Association annual conference
in Brighton that they would probably be encouraged to calculate borrowers'
ability to repay loans on the basis of minimum mortgage rates of 10 per
cent.
Mrs Gilmore's disclosure of details of a forthcoming prudential note from
the commission is likely to add to growing caution among mortgage lenders
about giving mortgages to borrowers lacking substantial savings.
But she emphasised that societies had 'a duty' not to cut off lending to
categories of borrowers such as single parents and older people living alone
whose income was 'both less, and less secure'.
Mrs Gilmore's remarks follow the disclosure by Bristol &amp; West Building
Society that it is to start pricing mortgages according to the family status
of borrowers later this year to take account of different risks.
She said trying to raise prices to cover higher risk in a particular segment
of the lending market was 'a particularly difficult strategy to isolate and
define accurately' for mass products.
'I doubt whether it can be done,' she said.
She said the 87 societies were now having to lend 'against a background in
which loan assets will be more fragile than ever before'. This would lead to
permanent changes in the way lending was done.
She remarked that mortgage loans above 90 per cent of property values would
in future be allocated a risk weighting of 65 per cent rather than 50 per
cent when calculating the capital to be set aside in balance sheets.
This she said would reflect the higher risk attached to loans of above 90
per cent because of changes in the terms of mortgage indemnity insurance of
societies under renegotiated contracts with insurers.
Mrs Gilmore also warned societies of the risks of failing to hedge fixed
rate or capped mortgages, and told them to err on the side of caution.
'The game at this stage is to bet low to find out more clearly what the
dangers are,' she said.
She said two years of falling house prices and high interest rates had
'driven home the dangers' of lending at a high proportion of loan to value.
Even some lenders with conservative policies had been 'taken aback' by the
risks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICERS at Brixton prison in south London refused yesterday to meet Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, because of fears about the effect on their
jobs of privatisation of the prisoner-escort service. Mr Howard, on his
first visit to a jail since becoming home secretary in last week's
government reshuffle, said he had been impressed by Brixton, the oldest
prison in London. 'Being in prison in Brixton isn't a picnic,' he said. 'But
nor should being in prison be a picnic.' He intended to continue with
privatisation because he believed the private sector had a role to play in
running prisons.

MANCHESTER yesterday officially took over from Rio de Janeiro as the venue
for global debate on how to reconcile industrial development with
environmental issues. There will be two events instead of the single
marathon run last year at Rio.
A government-run conference in September will address the implemention of
policies agreed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio, while a wider 10-day
Global Forum involving local authorities, industry and commerce,
environmental lobby groups and the general public will take place in June
next year.
It is hoped that Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, will attend the forum.
The government will pay for the September event but the Pounds 4m funding of
the forum has yet to be finalised.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Storing up long-term doubts: Why it is so hard to put a
price on decommissioning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE estimate that it will cost Pounds 18bn to dismantle Britain's civil
nuclear facilities begs one main question: the ultimate destination of the
radioactive waste.
Environmentalists are criticising the NAO report on decommissioning, which
is published today, for the 'absurdity' of projecting the costs of
decommissioning when the method and timing are still unclear.
Mr Simon Roberts of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'With no
nuclear waste disposal facility in place and no detailed case for safe
decommissioning presented to regulators, Pounds 18bn is definitely an
opening bid for the cost of the nuclear legacy.'
The NAO said yesterday: 'We took the industry's figures for decommissioning
costs - we did not recalculate them - but we have pointed out all the
uncertainties.'
Nuclear facilities generally have a life of several decades, and the process
of dismantling them begins immediately they are closed. The cost of
decommissioning is high because of the need to shield workers from
radioactivity, which requires remote-control machinery, and the need to
store the radioactive waste safely, sometimes for centuries, until
radioactivity levels have fallen.
However, the timescale makes the costs difficult to project. On present
plans, decommissioning would carry on for at least 100 years after a plant
was closed. As the NAO points out: 'No large-scale reactor has yet been
fully decommissioned, either in this country or elsewhere.'
The office argued yesterday that the uncertainty of the final destination of
the waste did not undermine the industry figures because the cost of storage
makes up a third or less of the total figure.
However the nuclear companies have made two controversial assumptions about
future storage: that an underground repository will be built below
Sellafield in Cumbria for medium-level waste, and that British Nuclear
Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant for high-level waste at Sellafield will get
the go-ahead.
Low-level waste, such as staff's contaminated overshoes and clothing, will
continue to go to British Nuclear Fuels' present storage at Sellafield, they
assume.
The assumptions are controversial because plans for the proposed Nirex store
below the ground at Sellafield have stalled and its costs are unknown. The
government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee warned in its
annual report last month that the timetable for opening this store was
'unrealistic' and that it might be difficult to get 'unequivocal evidence'
that the geological conditions were suitable.
The report also leaves open the thorny question of the timing of
decommissioning. The NAO has assumed that reactors would be razed to
greenfield sites within 100 years and fuel treatment plants within 50 years.
But the industry wants to spread the costs over at least 135 years. That
would need an extra step - building a concrete shell around a decommissioned
plant while waiting for radioactivity levels to fall.
The total costs would be higher, but when discounted to allow for the fact
that the money would not be spent for years, the sum in today's money would
be lower. On industry estimates, the delay could reduce the cost of
decommissioning a Magnox reactor from Pounds 500m to Pounds 300m in today's
money values.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Rivals wide of unity goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN uneasy attempt to display some club unity, Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry
Venables, the chairman and chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur Football
club, joined ranks yesterday to promote the international Makita football
tournament, Gillian Tett writes. It was their first joint appearance since
Mr Sugar tried to sack Mr Venables.
But with the court hearing on the sacking due next Tuesday, not even
refereeing by a press manager, who banned questions on the battle, could
entirely mask the animosity.
Mr Sugar looking poker face, studiously ignored his rival but said that 'in
spite of the difficulties that have been going on' he hoped the fans would
support the tournament which Spurs will host next month.
Mr Venables, who seemed relaxed and cheerful, echoed the sentiment. He said
he hoped to be at Tottenham for the tournament, which will feature Spurs,
Chelsea, Ajax and Lazio.
The Spurs supporters club plans a boycott of the Makita tournament.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Basic pay increases drop to low level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASIC PAY increases fell to a median of 2.6 per cent in the three months to
April, probably the lowest level since the late 1960s, Industrial Relations
Services, the independent pay research company, said yesterday, Lisa Wood
writes.
The figure partly reflects the effect of the 1.5 per cent ceiling on those
public-sector pay rises with April review dates.
The research says pay settlements in private-sector organisations were
continuing to fall and further falls seemed likely.
Basic pay rises in the private sector fell from 3 per cent in the three
months ending March to 2.75 per cent in the three months ending in April.
The figure was 4.2 per cent the year before.
The research says a quarter of pay awards in the three months to the end of
April were worth 1.5 per cent or less.
The research says there is little likelihood of a significant pick-up in
private-sector deals in the next few months.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Taxpayers may bear cost of scrapping nuclear plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TAXPAYERS may have to bear a large part of the burden of scrapping
civil nuclear facilities, the National Audit Office, the public-expenditure
watchdog, says in a report published today.
The reason, it says, is that 'considerable uncertainty' surrounds the
nuclear industry's ability to pay.
Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent some time after March
1995 if the government does not intervene, partly because of future
decommissioning costs, the NAO said.
Nuclear facilities have a limited lifetime and safely dismantling them will
be one of the nuclear industry's biggest financial burdens.
The report, which is the most comprehensive government study of
decommissioning costs to date, estimated it would cost Pounds 18bn to
decommission all of the industry's facilities, but said that is 'affected by
a wide range of uncertainties'.
While it is difficult to estimate total costs, the report said they would be
spread over more than 100 years. Some disposal plans have not yet been
approved by the regulators, and the UK has not yet decided which method to
use for long-term disposal of radioactive waste.
However it pointed out its estimates do not discount the amount of money to
be spent in the future. It calculated the undiscounted decommissioning costs
for Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear and British Nuclear Fuels, which make
up most of the civil nuclear sector, to be Pounds 14.5bn and the discounted
value at Pounds 5.9bn.
The Atomic Energy Authority also has undiscounted costs of Pounds 3.5bn.
Nuclear Electric told the NAO that it expected 'to be able to meet all
decommissioning liabilities as they fall due'.
However the office warned that if operating costs rose - particularly for
disposing of waste from regular operations - the generators could be unable
to meet long-term decommissioning liabilities.
It added that 'the present electricity supply market provides no mechanism
through which any increases in costs can be passed on directly to
consumers'.
Nuclear Electric said yesterday: 'We believe we can cover liabilities
without any extension of the nuclear levy' - paid by electricity consumers
and worth more than Pounds 1.2bn a year, the levy ends in 1998.
Scottish Nuclear said yesterday that its financial results would show that
it was not technically insolvent.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Tory right squares up for Euro battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY RIGHTWINGERS yes-terday made what were virtual declarations of war on
the government, as ministers prepared for a tough time when MPs return next
week from the Whitsun recess.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, struggled to assert his authority over
the party, Mr Edward Leigh, sacked as a trade and industry minister in last
week's reshuffle, called on the right of the party to organise more
effectively and exercise its political muscle.
Mr Leigh used an article in The Spectator to accuse the government of being
unwilling to tolerate dissent and to claim it was afraid of views 'different
from its own.'
Giving an account of his sacking, Mr Leigh spoke of his 'despair' at having
voted for Maastricht because he did not want to rock the boat publicly in
difficult times. 'Never again will I vote against my conscience,' he said.
He claimed the cabinet was still unrepresentative of the parliamentary
party. The Left had 'achieved its ambition to control economic, foreign and
industrial policy' while the Right sat 'beleaguered in isolated fortresses.'
The news that German chancellor Helmut Kohl was to convene a special EC
summit this autumn to relaunch the drive to political and monetary union
sparked a fresh outburst from Tory Euro-sceptics.
Other right-wingers warned of a possible battle over the government's moves
to narrow the budget deficit. Any move to reduce public sector borrowing by
raising direct taxation would spark 'an unholy revolt', one senior MP
warned.
Further high-profile clashes on Europe and public spending are in prospect
when parliament reconvenes next week.
On Monday and Tuesday, the Lords are to start debating the bill implementing
the Maastricht treaty, which completed its tortuous passage through the
Commons last month.
Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, and Baroness Thatcher, the former
prime minister, are among more than 100 peers who are understood to be
intending to speak.
Meanwhile Labour will probably give MPs the chance to discuss public
spending on Wednesday by selecting it as an opposition day debate.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Headteachers slam ministers' pay policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Association of Head Teachers yesterday condemned the
government's approach to public-sector pay as 'inequitable, short-sighted
and potentially damaging'.
But concern surfaced at the association's conference at Newcastle upon Tyne
about delegates' hostile reception to Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, on Wednesday. Delegates were alarmed by the morning's press
coverage, much of which was strongly unfavourable.
Mr Peter Baldwin, a former president of the association, suggested that
dignified silence would have been more effective than jeers and hisses. 'I'm
a believer in silence speaking volumes.'
But others felt it was justified. Mrs Patricia Moss, head of an infant
school in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said Lord Joseph when education
secretary had been greeted by silence and had regarded it as a 'warm
reception'.
Head teachers were also pleased to have demonstrated to their staff that
they opposed Mr Patten's stance on the publication of school-by-school
'league tables'.
Mrs Diane Darwin, a NAHT member from Newcastle upon Tyne, said an adverse
reaction from the more rightwing newspapers could be expected, but that
heads would now find it much easier to work with the support of their staff.
Mr David Hart, NAHT general secretary, emphasised that an article written by
Mr Patten for yesterday's Financial Times left the gap between the sides on
league tables as wide as ever. 'Clearly the government has the right to know
whether quality is being delivered by the state education system. But the
key issue is whether we have to arrive at the conclusion that we have to do
that using league tables.
'The NAHT is categorically of the opinion that we do not. There are other
ways in which the information can be sent to government without using crude
league tables.'
The Secondary Heads Association will decide next week whether to follow the
NAHT policy of advising its members to call on governors not to forward
league table information to the Department for Education. The SHA said: 'We
are not convinced that the raw statistics in these tables tell parents what
they need to know.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Toyota to boost output ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the Japanese carmaker, plans to produce 100,000 cars during 1994 at
its Burnaston plant near Derby, a year ahead of its previously announced
schedule.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota, said the company was also
considering producing a second model range at the Pounds 700m UK plant in
addition to the Carina E large family car, which started production there
last December.
Toyota had previously said it was developing capacity to build 200,000 cars
a year at the Burnaston plant, which will be officially opened today.
Mr Toyoda said that output of the Carina E range was unlikely to exceed
140,000 to 150,000 a year. Toyota plans to produce 36,000 cars this year at
Burnaston.
Toyota has not yet decided what additional range should be produced in the
UK, but Mr Toyoda said that smaller cars were winning an increasing share of
the overall market for new cars in Europe.
Toyota said that it had also advanced its local-content targets for the UK
plant with the aim of reaching 80 per cent local European content by the end
of 1994 rather than by mid-1995.
The Japanese carmaker, which employs 1,350 at its UK car assembly and engine
plants - including 100 at its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, Clwyd -
is planning to recruit a further 600 employees by the end of 1993.
It expects to reach full production on a single shift by the end of the year
and will begin two-shift working in January next year at Burnaston.
The UK workforce is expected to reach 3,300 - including 300 at Deeside  - at
a production level of 200,000 cars a year.
Mr Toyoda said that the present strength of the Japanese yen favoured a more
rapid build-up of production in Europe.
He said, however, that the yen was 'overvalued' at present exchange rates.
'At Y110 to Dollars 1 Japanese labour rates are very high,' Mr Toyoda added.
Toyota was not yet planning to export vehicles from the UK to markets
outside Europe, but this was a possibility at a later stage, Mr Toyoda said.
'With an overvalued yen this becomes a possibility. We did not expect the
yen to be this strong.'
Toyota has not yet decided to invest in a fully-fledged research and
development centre in Europe for new vehicle design and engineering, said Mr
Toyoda, but this was under consideration.
'Within 10 years there is the possibility of having a technical centre in
Europe with the capacity to develop new models,' he said.
Toyota has a small technical centre in Zaventem, Belgium, which assists in
the design and development of vehicles for the European market and carries
out type approval work to meet European regulations. It also has a small
design centre in Zaventem for studying European design trends.

WORKERS AT Shell's Haven oil refinery in Essex are refusing to accept
individual contracts of employment and union derecognition, it was announced
yesterday. Mr Fred Higgs, TGWU national secretary for the oil industry, said
that Shell was 'attempting to deny our 470 members their basic right to

Yesterday Shell confirmed that it was going ahead with derecognition at the
Haven refinery for wage bargaining purposes, though workers can still belong
to unions. It also announced it would impose compulsory redundancies by the
end of next year.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Tec highlights IT skills shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND NOW outstrips the supply of people with adequate information
technology skills according to a survey of employers in London.
West London Training and Enterprise Council, which surveyed 719 employers,
said the shortfall would get worse unless effective action was taken because
the number of people using IT and the number of businesses introducing it
were expected to grow.
West London Tec said there was a backlog of 50m to 100m man - days of IT
training in the UK, and there was 'no clear consensus as to what skills are
required, who should have them or how they should be developed'.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Bristol strikes deal to develop 27-acre site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL Development Corporation has struck its most significant deal yet
with agreement to develop 27 acres of land as a retail and leisure complex,
which the corporation says will eventually create about 1,500 jobs.
Contracts have been exchanged with Wilson Connolly, the commercial property
arm of Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, as lead developer of the site, close to
the city centre. Financial terms of the deal, announced yesterday, have not
been disclosed but the corporation puts a Pounds 50m value on the completed
scheme, which will include nearly 200,000 sq ft of retail space. Agreement
has also been reached with National Amusements of the US for a 14-screen
cinema with 3,600 seats.
The development will be on two parcels of derelict land straddling the river
Avon in south-east Bristol and alongside a new spine road, which is under
construction and due for completion next summer. The road links the M32 and
the A4 Bath road.
Mr Miles Collinge, chief executive of the corporation, said yesterday: 'Our
policy of putting infrastructure first has now paid off and has led directly
to the securing of this significant regeneration project, the largest
leisure and retail complex in the south of England.'
Wilson Connolly has submitted a detailed planning application to the
corporation and is expected to complete the scheme before the end of 1994.
Mr Alan Rudge, managing director of Wilson Connolly, said the sites were
'outstanding locations for leisure and retail facilities, which Bristol and
the surrounding area are currently lacking'.
Imperial Chemical Industries will today submit a planning application to
improve road access to 2,000 acres of land owned by the company near the
River Severn including a fertiliser plant and a pharmaceutical works.
ICI wants an interchange on the new M49, which crosses the company's land
and links the M5 with the second Severn bridge, now under construction.
There are expansion plans for the Avlon Works and ICI has long-standing
outline planning consent to develop 1,500 acres for commercial and leisure
use.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Names barred from suing in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London yesterday claimed victory in an important legal case
brought against it by dissatisfied American Names - individuals whose assets
back the insurance market's business.
Reaffirming a lower court decision by Judge Morris Lasker on August 18, the
US Court of Appeals for the second circuit ruled that US Names should settle
their disputes with Lloyd's in the English courts under English law.
Approximately 120 US names had argued that the agreements they signed on
joining Lloyd's contravened US securities laws.
In his original verdict Judge Lasker ruled that the truly international
character of membership of Lloyd's and the adequacy of remedies afforded to
US Names under English law justified enforcement of the members' agreements
with Lloyd's to have any Lloyd's related litigation or arbitration heard in
England.
The appeals court also reaffirmed the obligations of Names to arbitrate
their disputes with their agents in England.
The failure of the US Names' case has strengthened the resolve of Mr Richard
Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, to hold an extraordinary
meeting calling for the liquidation of Lloyd's.
Mr Astor said he was halfway towards collecting the 100 Names' signatures
necessary to force the meeting. Mr Astor's parents and brother have both
suffered large losses at Lloyd's. 'The motivation for this is pure anger.
They have all been conned,' Mr Astor said.
Mr Roger Pascall, of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest
organisation of Lloyd's Names, said his organisation would not support the
extraordinary meeting. Lloyd's said insurers had won an appeal in an
important US pollution case.
On Wednesday the US Court of Appeals for the third circuit upheld a lower
court ruling that insurers were not liable for clean-up of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) on property owned by the Texas Eastern Transmission
Corporation. Potential insurance claims involved are Dollars 750m (Pounds
487m), of which some Dollars 450m would have hit the London market.
Since 1958 the corporation has operated a 10,000 mile-long pipeline
delivering natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico to the north east of the
United States. The PCBs were used as a lubricant. The corporation was
ordered to clean up these sites and filed a suit against its insurers in
December 1987 to show that policies issued to it between 1958 and 1987
covered clean-up costs.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Travellers given flight options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS last night began offering three options to passengers who
might be affected by a strike by its ground staff and cabin crew.
These included booking them on an alternative BA flight on a different day;
offering a flight the same day on another airline; or giving a full refund,
including non-refundable Apex or other promotional fares.
Passengers can contact BA at two numbers: 081-897 4000 in London and
0345-222111 outside the capital.
The airline carries on average about 70,000 passengers a day worldwide. It
said last night it would accept responsibility for travel dis-ruption caused
to passengers by the industrial action.
Under its contingency plans for a full 24-hour strike, BA said it expected
to operate more than half its long-haul transcontinental services, 11 of its
usual 150 services to Europe from Heathrow, and regional services to
overseas destinations. There will be no domestic services from Heathrow or
Gatwick. As many as 470 flights to and from Heathrow and Gatwick might have
to be cancelled.
BA said it did not expect Concorde flights to be affected. It expected to
operate one flight to Latin America and two to South Africa.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Litany of charges against Invesco detailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 750,000 fines levied yesterday on Invesco MIM by Imro, the
self-regulating body for fund management organisations, with costs of Pounds
1.6m, are a record for an SRO disciplinary case.
The more painful punishment for the group is the litany of charges Imro
published yesterday.
The first charge states that between July 1988 and December 1992, Invesco
MIM Management (IMM) 'failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that its
officers and employees acted in conformity with their own and their
employer's relevant responsibilities under the regulatory system'. IMM also
failed to 'ensure it had in place internal controls and systems adequate for
the size, nature and complexity of its activities'.
IMM also paid money which was not clients' money into a client money
account, and breached regulations on the handling of clients' money. It
provided 'inaccurate' information to Imro and issued a misleading
advertisement.
The second set of eight charges relates to Invesco MIM Unit Trust Managers
(IMUTM). The first says 'in or about May 1990, Invesco notified Imro of a
pricing error in respect of shares held by a unit trust scheme but did not
reveal how the error had arisen or its scale.'
Another charge is that between April 1988 and April 1990 IMUTM valued a fund
incorrectly.
Further charges said between January 1989 and November 1991, IMUTM failed to
ensure that only client money was held in designated client bank accounts,
and between September 1987 and September 1992, it made an investment on
behalf of an authorised unit trust which was outside the trust's objective.
The third set of 20 charges was brought against Invesco Ventures, covering
issues such as carrying on business outside permitted areas, breaches of
rules pertaining to customer title documents, defective record-keeping,
provision of inaccurate regulatory information, financial resource
deficiencies, failure to provide investors with accurate and timely
information and undisclosed conflicts of interest made on behalf of
customers.
The penultimate set of charges was against Invesco Ventures and Invesco MIM
Management. These say unsuitable investments were made by IMM and IVL on
behalf of customers, who subsequently suffered losses.
The fifth set of three charges covers IMM's conduct in relation to assets
belonging to the Mirror Group Pension Scheme, plundered by the late Mr
Robert Maxwell.
The charges state IMM failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns
about how the pension fund's assets under IMM's management were being used.
They say IMM failed to disclose to the pension fund trustees that it no
longer had custody of investments it was managing on their behalf.
The other charge says that on 19 October 1990, IMM, in custody of
certificates on investments valued at Pounds 26.7m belonging to 'some of its
customers', parted with their possession of those certificates to a third
party other than on the instructions of the customers.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Adviser fined over home-income plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DBS Financial Management, the UK's largest independent financial adviser
group, has been fined Pounds 60,000 by Fimbra, the self-regulating
organisation for independent financial advisers.
The fine relates to the activities of Sandy Park Financial Services, an
appointed representative of DBS, and its sale of home-income plans in the
period 1988 to 1990. The plans were devised as a way for (mostly elderly)
investors to unlock capital in their homes by remortgaging their homes and
investing the proceeds in the hope of earning enough to meet mortgage
payments with extra income on top.
Some firms, including Sandy Park, backed the plans with single-premium
investment bonds. When the value of the bonds fell and interest rates rose,
investors suff-ered financial difficulties.
In addition to paying the fine and costs, DBS must write to remaining
home-income clients of Sandy Park and advise them to consider taking
professional advice. DBS is continuing to defend legal actions instituted in
connection with home-income plans.
DBS terminated its relationship with Sandy Park in April 1991, and the group
says it has taken firm action to strengthen any possible gaps in compliance
or monitoring procedures.
The announcement was unusual in that it was made by the disciplined
organisation rather than by the regulator. Shares in DBS Management, DBS's
parent company, are traded on the Stock Exchange under rule 535(2) and the
company said it felt it was appropriate to inform shareholders.
Fimbra said it would not comment until the end of the legal period in which
DBS is entitled to appeal.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Supergun probe to contact Chilean arms man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTT inquiry, investigating claims that the government colluded in the
sale of weapons to Iraq in breach of its own guidelines, said yesterday that
it would write to Mr Carlos Cardoen, the Chilean arms manufacturer, to see
if he has relevant evidence.
In an interview on BBC TV's Newsnight earlier this week Mr Cardoen said he
would be willing to give evidence to the Scott inquiry but was worried about
travelling outside Chile in case he was kidnapped by the US authorities.
The Scott inquiry team feels it may get everything it needs from Mr Cardoen
by letter and is unlikely to wish to visit him in Chile.
Mr Cardoen was involved in the sale of weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq
war and his company worked closely with Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based
machine tools company at the centre of Britain's arms to Iraq scandal.
The Scott inquiry was set up in response to the uproar caused by the
collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. Charges of illegal exports against
three executives were dropped when it emerged that the intelligence services
had been briefed about their activities and that they had received
encouragement for the exports from Mr Alan Clark, then trade minister.
The US justice department has filed arms export charges against Mr Cardoen
and Teledyne, a California defence contractor. The indictment concerns the
alleged illegal export from the US to Chile between 1982 and 1989 of
zirconium, a metal made by Teledyne. The metal was allegedly used by Mr
Cardoen to make about 24,000 cluster bombs that were then sold to Iraq.
Mr Cardoen has said that the Washington authorities knew about and granted
approval for his arms exports to Iraq as part of a bias towards Iraq during
the 1980s. His assertions that he regularly briefed CIA officials contradict
previous statements by the Bush administration. Two years ago a joint
investigation by the Financial Times and ABC TV found that Mr Cardoen had
indeed had relationships with US intelligence officials.
The Scott inquiry said anything Mr Cardoen may be able to contribute about
the role of British government officials is likely to be relevant to
questions later in the public hearings. The hearings began last month and
are scheduled to continue at least until September.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 computer staff of Barclays, the UK's biggest bank, are
voting on whether to take industrial action over pay.
Bifu, the banking union, said the ballot followed Barclays' refusal to
improve a pay offer 'worth less than 1.5 per cent'. Options being considered
are a three-day strike at computer centres and an overtime ban. Any action
would affect cash machine operations, cheque clearance and computer-based
transactions.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Leasing scheme for rail stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced plans to create three new companies to
lease passenger rolling stock to rail operators which win franchises to run
trains after the British Rail privatisation begins next April, John Willman
writes.
The companies will initially be established as BR subsidiaries, with access
to the National Loans Fund for state-owned organisations. However, they will
be expected to seek private-sector capital to finance new investment and
will eventually be privatised.
Advisers are to be sought from the private sector to structure the three
companies and provide the commercial and financial skills needed to set them
up. BR will seek tenders next week.
The companies will take over the existing BR fleet of 11,000 vehicles, worth
about Pounds 2bn at written-down historic cost value, on April 1 next year.
The fleet will be divided between the companies so that there is more than
one lessor for most types of rolling stock.
The lease companies will offer operating leases, bearing the residual value
risk. They will not have in-house maintenance capabilities, and will
contract with engineering companies for whatever maintenance the lessees are
not required to do.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Peace plan may stop BA strike early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PEACE plan may end today's strike at British Airways a few hours after it
has begun.
The plan was negotiated last night between British Airways and the TGWU
transport union to guarantee the future security of cabin crews and ground
staff who were called out on a 24-hour strike for today.
Mr George Wright, the union's civil aviation negotiator, said that it was
too late to call off the strike, but today at 10am the peace formula would
be recommended to a meeting of union shop stewards at BA. He said the
proposals, reached after long negotiations, would provide a 'new
relationship between BA and the TGWU'.
Union officials said they hoped disruption to flights today would be
'minimal'.
The strike was called over alleged cuts in pay and fringe benefits in BA's
subsidiaries. The airline's 250 white-collar supervisory, clerical and
passenger service staff are also due to strike at Gatwick airport today.
In a separate development, pilots at BA have voted by a five-to-one majority
in a secret postal ballot to take strike action. In a 92 per cent turnout,
the pilots voted 2,152 in favour with only 402 against.
If the pilots strike all BA's 207 long-and short-haul craft would be
grounded. Balpa, the pilots' union, estimates that BA would suffer Pounds
16m in lost fares for each strike day.
Mr Chris Darke, the union's general secretary, said last night the ballot
result showed 'the depth of ill-feeling among our members'.
Mr Darke added: 'The massive response and overwhelming majority for strike
action indicates pilots are deeply dissatisfaction with the way BA are
seeking to impose changes without agreement.'
Mr Darke said he had written to Mr Robert Ayling, BA's chief executive,
demanding an immediate resumption of talks.
The union is concerned at what it sees as the company's attempt to divide
pilots by introducing separate contracts of employment in its Gatwick
subsidiary, which was set up last November after BA's takeover of Dan Air.
Pilots in the subsidiary are paid 30 per cent less than those elsewhere in
the airline.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Dundee united in derisive thumbs-down: The Timex plant may
close now that strikers have rejected the peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S unanimous rejection by the Timex strikers of a peace plan
negotiated by their union to end their four-month strike reflects how
attitudes have hardened.
But the strikers may have lost their only opportunity to resolve the dispute
with some semblance of victory.
Their derisive thumbs-down after less than half an hour of emotional debate
is a bitter blow to the AEEU engineering union. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the union's
Scottish executive officer, had negotiated hard with Timex's management over
the past fortnight in search of a compromise deal he believed the strikers
could live with.
What he presented to the 340 strikers in Dundee yesterday was the best he
believes the company will offer. A one-year wage freeze may have been hard
for them to swallow as well as cuts in fringe benefits - it has been
calculated that the deal would have been equivalent to a 27 per cent
reduction in living standards.
But Mr Airlie pointed with some satisfaction to concessions he had extracted
from the company, not without difficulty. For Timex to offer jobs back for
all strikers and not just rehire selectively was a genuine breakthrough.
Timex also accepted that it should pay statutory minimum redundancy to those
who did not want to be re-employed, which Mr Airlie told the strike meeting
was a 'unique' concession in his long experience.
It is hard for the union's national leadership to know what to do next. 'We
have no options left,' said one official.
None of the full-time union officials outside Dundee believe they can do
anything that will ensure any kind of victory. 'The trouble is we are
dealing with virgin strikers. They have suffered a grave injustice by all
being sacked and they see no good reason why they should compromise to get
their old jobs back,' said another official.
The strikers' resolute stance will strengthen the hand of Timex's local
manager Mr Peter Hall. It was his decision to fire all the workers in
January and replace them with a new labour force when they refused to accept
much smaller cuts in their pay and benefits than are now being demanded.
Last night Mr Hall made clear the company's offer would not be improved.
There have been differences on how to resolve the strike between Mr Hall and
Mr John Dryfe, the US-based Timex director responsible for the company's
circuit board business, who was himself once in charge of the Dundee plant.
Mr Hall has hinted that he wants to re-employ selectively from the strikers.
He seems to have no genuine desire to see all of them back inside the plant,
particularly the shop stewards whom he blames for the deterioration of
industrial relations.
But when Mr Bill Jordan, the union president, and Mr Airlie made a private
appeal to the company, Timex decided to see whether a settlement could be
negotiated.
Since January the strike has become a cause celebre not just in the British
Labour movement but across the world. Achieving a deal was seen by some in
the company as an important move in helping to restore Timex's tainted
image.
After yesterday the company has three options. One is to go on as before,
recruiting a larger substitute workforce and ignoring the strikers. Another
is to go back to the bargaining table with the union and improve the offer.
But there is also a final option that many in Timex management outside
Dundee might start to consider - closing the plant. Circuit board production
is not part of the company's core business and it loses money. Mr Dryfe says
it was mainly for sentimental reasons that the company stayed in Dundee,
introducing circuit board manufacture, after shifting watch production to
France 10 years ago.
The strike leaders have often declared that if they do not win, they would
prefer to see the plant closed.
If the dispute drags on to autumn and beyond, this may become an
increasingly attractive option for a company that feels hard done by and
believes it has done all it can to resolve one of the most bitter strikes
seen in Britain for years.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Tory right in fresh sniping at cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced renewed sniping from Tory right-wingers yesterday as
ministers prepared for a tough time when MPs return from the Whitsun recess
next week.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, struggled to assert his authority over
the party, Mr Edward Leigh, sacked as a trade and industry minister in last
week's reshuffle, called on the right of the party to organise more
effectively and exercise its political muscle.
The news that German chancellor Helmut Kohl was planning to convene a
special EC summit this autumn to relaunch the drive to political and
monetary union sparked a fresh outburst from Tory Euro-sceptics.
Other right-wingers warned of a possible battle over the government's moves
to narrow the budget deficit. Any move to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement by raising direct taxation would spark 'an unholy revolt', one
senior MP warned.
Further high-profile clashes on Europe and public spending are in prospect
when parliament reconvenes next week.

PILOTS AT British Airways have voted by a five-to-one majority in a secret

<TEXT>
MR Bob Collins, Australia's transport minister, yesterday added fuel to an
air war between Australia and the US, by accusing US-based Northwest
Airlines of falsely reporting passenger loads on flights from Japan, Reuter
reports from Canberra.
Australia has ordered Northwest this week to cut one of its three New
York-Osaka-Sydney flights by June 30, saying Northwest was in breach of an
agreement restricting it to a maximum 50 per cent of capacity with
passengers from Japan.
In a tit-for-tat move, the US ordered Australia's Qantas Airways to withdraw
from three of 10 weekly Sydney-Los Angeles non-stop services by the end of
June.
Mr Collins said figures show Northwest had consistently breached the
agreement for flying passengers to Australia.
'The figures show that since Northwest began its three weekly flights in
October 1991 up until April 1993, Osaka-Sydney passengers have averaged 75.6
per cent of those on the board,' Mr Collins said in a statement.
However a Northwest spokesman said the figures were 'warped' and that
Northwest had never claimed to comply with the order because it did not
recognise it under a 1952 treaty.
Mr Collins also rejected an earlier claim by the airline that it had signed
the agreement under duress.
Australia argues that Northwest is operating its flights at the expense of
Qantas.

TAIWAN'S economics ministry may ease restrictions on capital flows as part
of the island's financial liberalisation, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The ministry is considering a proposal to allow Taiwanese companies to send
investment funds of more than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) out of the country
without approval. Remittances totalling less than Dollars 5m a year can
already be made freely.
Companies would still need central bank approval for the outward flows, and
the ministry would continue to screen all Taiwanese investments in China
because Taipei wanted to prevent excessive capital movements, the spokesman
said.
He said the ministry was also considering proposals to relax restrictions on
foreign investment in Taiwan.

FT  04 JUN 93 / UK, China resume HK airport talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China resume talks today on Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar
airport project amid signs that China might be prepared to agree terms of a
new financial package.
Talks about the financing of the HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.9bn) project
have been stalled since last October when Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's
governor, publicised his plans for the colony's political development.
Although much construction work for the new airport is under way, China has
refused to grant approval to the Hong Kong government's plans for financing
the Airport Authority, the manager of the new airport, or approve a
financial package for funding a planned railway which will connect the
airport to Hong Kong's central business district.
Since bilateral talks on the colony's political development began more than
a month ago, China has removed some of the blocks to Hong Kong's economic
development.
This has raised hopes in the colony that China may be prepared to agree the
financing of the airport and the railway.
Earlier this week Mr Chen Zou'er, a senior official with Beijing's Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office, said he hoped the airport could be built by June
1997, when sovereignty over the colony is transferred from Britain to China.
Mr Chen reiterated China's position that the project should be cost
effective and that it should not constitute a financial burden to the
post-1997 government of the colony.
Beijing has come under increasing pressure from the business community in
Hong Kong - many of whom have been co-opted by China to advise on Hong Kong
affairs - to separate the economic aspects of the colony's future from the
bilateral dispute about political development.
Two weeks ago Beijing waved through three business franchises which span the
1997 change in sovereignty and moved, in short order, to resume talks on the
airport and working level discussions within the Joint Liaison Group on
other matters relating to the transfer.
Hong Kong government officials, while acknowledging the improvement in the
atmosphere, said they remained unsure whether Beijing wanted to settle the
airport dispute before it had settled the issue of Hong Kong's political
development.
'It really depends if they want to do a deal or carry on using the airport
as a carrot or a stick,' said one. 'We really do not know.'
A month ago the government passed to China a third option for financing the
airport and its railway.
This provides for a readjustment of the equity and debt structure of the
project in a way the government hopes will meet the concerns that China
raised over the previous two proposals.
Its first financial plan of March last year envisaged debt for the airport
and railway of some HKDollars 73bn. Its September proposal cut combined debt
to HKDollars 23bn after allowing for an equity injection of HKDollars 40bn,
to be funded equally by the present and future governments of Hong Kong.
The third proposal, which is a variation of that of September, provides for
less equity and more debt. Details of this option are being closely guarded
by both sides.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Japan's surplus up 14.6% in April: Tokyo believes rise is
exaggeration given the appreciation of the yen
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN'S current account surplus, which this week came in for renewed
criticism from the US adminstration, rose by 14.6 per cent to Dollars
11.27bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in April compared with the same month last year, the
finance ministry said yesterday.
The surge in the Japanese surplus was this week strongly criticised by US
officials in Paris for meetings of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary said the surplus was a drag on
world and US growth, while Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, insisted
Washington wanted trade agreements with Japan which would deliver measurable
results in cutting the surplus.
The current account surplus, which many Tokyo economists believe will reach
Dollars 140bn this financial year, rose from Dollars 9.8bn last April. The
trade surplus jumped by 16 per cent to Dollars 11.71bn from April 1992.
However, the Japanese authorities believe the rise in the surplus in dollar
terms is an exaggeration given the recent appreciation of the yen against
the dollar. The yen, which closed at Y107.87 to the dollar in Tokyo
yesterday, has risen from about Y125 since the turn of the year. Much of the
most recent rise in the surplus is due to the rise in value of
dollar-denominated exports.
In yen terms the current account surplus fell by 3.6 per cent to Y12,678bn,
while the trade surplus was 2.4 per cent down at Y13,168bn in April compared
with the same month last year.
In dollar terms exports were 11.9 per cent up in April on a year before at
Dollars 29.78bn, while in yen terms they fell by 5.8 per cent to Y33.49bn.
The rise in exports outstripped the increase in imports, with were worth
Dollars 18bn in April, a 9.4 per cent increase on a year before.
The yen's appreciation has prompted a renewed outflow of long-term capital
from Japan, to recycle its trade earnings. There was a net outflow of
long-term capital worth Dollars 7.5bn in April, almost double the amount in
April last year. The outflow was mainly due to investment in bonds.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Direct investment abroad falls 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE foreign direct investment fell by 18 per cent in 1992 as the
downturn in the Japanese economy and the slump on the Tokyo stock market
continued to take its toll on manufacturing companies' ability to finance
international ambitions.
Foreign direct investment fell from Dollars 41.6bn (Pounds 26.8bn) in 1991
to Dollars 34.138bn in 1992, according to figures published by the finance
ministry. In 1990 foreign direct investment from Japan was worth Dollars
56.9bn.
However, the continued steep fall in overseas investment masked important
shifts in the destination of Japanese capital outflows. While investment in
the US and Europe fell, investment in Asia rose from Dollars 5.9bn to
Dollars 6.4bn. Investment in Asia accounted for 18.8 per cent of all
Japanese foreign direct investment, up from 12.4 per cent in 1990.
Over the same period the share of Japanese investment in the the US declined
from 45.9 per cent to 40.5 per cent of the total, while Europe's share fell
from 25.1 per cent to 20.7 per cent.
Investment in the US dropped from Dollars 18bn in 1991 to Dollars 13.8bn
last year. Investment in Europe dropped from Dollars 9.4bn to Dollars 7bn
but the UK maintained its share of Japanese investment.
Japanese companies made 197 direct investments in the UK last year worth
Dollars 2.9bn, compared with 22 investments worth Dollars 3.4bn in 1991.
Investment in the Netherlands fell from Dollars 1.9bn to Dollars 1.4bn,
while spending in Germany dropped from Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 769m and in
France it fell from Dollars 817m to Dollars 456m.
Investment in Asia surged with the scale of investment rising markedly. In
1991 Japanese companies made investments in Asia worth Dollars 5.94bn. Last
year they made investments worth Dollars 6.42bn. The main beneficiary was
China. Investments there rose from Dollars 579m in 1991 to Dollars 1.07bn
last year. China accounted for 3.1 per cent of Japanese foreign direct
investment, up from 0.6 per cent in 1990.
While Asia is gaining at the expense of the US and Europe, China is the
overall winner regarding investment within the Asia region. Japanese direct
investment fell in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and the
Phillipines.
Investment by Japanese manufacturing companies fell from Dollars 12.3bn to
Dollars 10bn. Chemical industry investment rose from Dollars 1.6bn in 1991

FT  04 JUN 93 / Aboriginal land deal proposed: Australian package condemned
</HEADLINE>

THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment yesterday proposed a sweeping package to protect
private mining and pastoral leases from aboriginal land claims. The 33-point
package includes legislation that would validate land titles issued between
1975 and the end of this month.
The move came on the eve of the first anniversary of a high court decision
which, for the first time, acknowledged that indigenous people had occupied
Australia before European settlement and still had rights to the land under
common law. Since that decision, aboriginal land councils have been
preparing to present claims in various courts around Australia.
One aboriginal tribe in the state of New South Wales recently lodged a writ
calling for the commonwealth and state governments to give up almost a
quarter of the state.
The government package also proposes to establish a formula under which
federal and state governments would share compensation payments to
aboriginal groups that might incur losses when leases are granted to private
holders. It also calls for the setting up of a special tribunal to deal with
aboriginal land claims.
Aboriginal land council officials have called the package a 'slimy and
useless piece of paper'. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Commission insists on veto power over land development, and on
mining royalties for development on land with native titles.
Mr Robert Tickner, the minister for aboriginal affairs, said the package was
on the table for discussion. 'It is not set in concrete,' he said.
The government has already attempted legislation to protect a large
development project in the Northern Territory. Last week it supported a
local government bill that would override native titles covering leases to a
ADollars 300m (Pounds 134m) lead-zinc mining project.
The McArthur river project, proposed to be developed by the Australian
mining group MIM and its Japanese partners, is expected to earn ADollars
200m a year in exports.
Australia's foreign debt as at the end of the March quarter stood at
ADollars 160.6bn (Pounds 72bn), a fall of 3.9 per cent from the figure at
the end of the previous December quarter.
This was the first quarterly fall in almost three years and was attributed
to debt repayments made by both the public and private sectors taking
advantage of lower interest rates.
The figure is, however, 7.9 per cent higher than at the end of the March
quarter last year.
Of the net foreign debt, the private sector accounted for 65 per cent or
ADollars 104.6m.
The ratio of the net foreign debt to GDP was 40.6 per cent, down 1.9 per
cent at the end of the previous quarter.
A permanent reduction in Australia's foreign debt is unlikely in the
foreseeable future because of the continuing high current account deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICAN politicians yesterday recommended a date next April for the
first all-race elections, but said the date must be confirmed in multi-party
talks later this month.
They named April 27, 1994, as the date for elections to a constituent
assembly and interim legislature - the first time a specific date has been
mentioned - but attached so many conditions to it that the date remains
largely symbolic.
The 26-party negotiating forum was unable to reach full agreement even on a
conditional resolution setting a date, with four delegations rejecting the
resolution. They were the KwaZulu government, speaking on behalf of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, along with the ultra-right Conservative Party, the
moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie and the black homeland of Ciskei.
But Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress,
claimed a strategic victory nonetheless: 'Setting the 27th of April as an
election date will reverberate throughout the country. Even those opposed to
confirming it will find it impossible to move the masses of our people away
from this date,' he told reporters after a 10-hour negotiating session.
Mr Ramaphosa and his ANC colleague, Mr Joe Slovo, who represents the South
African Communist Party in the talks, were obviously keen to set a date,
however provisional, before next week's meeting of the ANC national
executive.
Yesterday's announcement of a provisional date could have major
psychological implications. The negotiators' resolution said it would 'send
a ray of hope and optimism' to South Africans, desperate for any sign of a
political solution which could restore stability.
Even if the date is agreed, no elections can be held until the parties agree
on an interim constitution.

FT  04 JUN 93 / The end of an African story: 500 years of ethnic hegemony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICA'S longest dominating ethnic minority is bowing to the winds of
change. Nearly 500 years after establishing their hegemony, and 30-odd years
after Harold Macmillan warned white South Africa that the days of apartheid
were numbered, Burundi's Tutsi elite seem set to surrender power to the
country's Hutu majority.
On Wednesday this week the first ever democratic elections in the central
African nation marked a watershed in a country scarred by tribal genocide.
Mr Melchior Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker and leader of the Burundi
Democracy Front, won 60 per cent of the vote to defeat military president
Major Pierre Buyoya.
The presidential poll is to be followed by legislative elections on June 29
ending a two-year transition to full democratic rule.
'Mr Ndadaye needs to win both (polls) to have real control of the country,'
cautioned one western election monitor quoted by Reuters in the capital
Bujumbura, but the Tutsis' ancient hold on the country appears to have been
broken.
Major Buyoya, a former army officer who came to power in a bloodless coup in
1987, has presided over a transition as difficult as any in Africa,
overcoming a bloody history.
The Tutsi minority, an unusually tall race making up 14 per cent of the 5.6m
population, have dominated the Hutu majority (85 per cent) since the 16th
century and little changed with independence in 1962.
A Hutu-led coup attempt in 1965 was ruthlessly suppressed, with many leading
members of the Hutu tribe losing their lives. Worse was to come.
In April 1972 began one of the worst slaughters the continent has known.
Michel Micombero, a young Tutsi army officer who seized power in a coup in
1966, claimed to have discovered a Hutu plot aimed at exterminating the
Tutsi.
There transpired 'the systematic killing of as many as a quarter of a
million people. . . . Over a four month period men, women and children were
savagely murdered at a rate of more than a thousand a day,' concluded an
investigation funded by the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
International concern was ineffectual and short-lived, and Burundi returned
to obscurity. Mr Micombero was replaced in a bloodless coup by his cousin,
Col Jean-baptiste Bagaza in 1976, himself deposed by Major Buyoya.
His first act of reconciliation was to share cabinet posts between the two
tribes, giving Hutu their first real voice in government in 20 years and
naming the first Hutu premier since 1965. But a further bout of ethnic
slaughter in 1988 killed at least 5,000 people, giving renewed urgency to
reform. Like the minority leaders in southern Africa, Burundi's president
had set in train a process of change he can no longer control.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: God-king finds a role as conciliator -
Victor Mallet observes the prince acting with characteristic panache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS vintage Sihanouk. With characteristic panache and flowery language,
Cambodia's former 'god-king' yesterday appointed himself prime minister
without consulting the United Nations peacekeepers charged with bringing
peace and democracy to his country.
The 70-year-old Prince Norodom Sihanouk - gourmet, wit and amateur
film-maker - had been waiting for his moment of glory since being overthrown
by Gen Lon Nol 23 years ago.
His friends and associates had long remarked on his obsession with righting
the wrongs of the coup, which he blamed on the Americans, and restoring
himself to legitimate power.
The prince, yearning for a popular mandate, had tried to have himself
elected president before the general election organised last week by the UN
as part of the 1991 Paris peace accords.
He abandoned the idea when it failed to inspire much enthusiasm among the
foreign countries supporting the peace plan, but took power yesterday on the
grounds that his authority was needed to reconcile the country's rival
factions while a new constitution is debated.
Basking in his role as conciliator, he described himself in yesterday's
statement in French to his people as 'Father of the Nation, Father of
National Unity, Father of National Reconciliation.'
He said: 'My beloved and respected compatriots, I am very old and sick. But
your untrammelled love, your confidence, your incomparable faithfulness and
your noble sense of justice towards me give me the strength to assume once
again the leadership of our venerated fatherland.'
Officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) could barely
suppress their groans. It was not so much that Prince Sihanouk had acted
irrationally - his new government is seen as a sensible way of reconciling
the royalists and the old communist administration which between them took
most of the votes in the election - as that he had acted hastily.
It was not clear last night if Prince Sihanouk's new government had even
received the endorsement of his son Prince Ranariddh, leader of the royalist
party Funcinpec.
Prince Sihanouk certainly did not talk about his plans to Mr Yasushi Akashi,
the long-suffering Untac chief.
The prince's attitude towards Untac and the peace plan which he himself
helped to negotiate has been typically fickle. He spent most of the past few
months at his home in Beijing instead of in Cambodia and at one point
withdrew his support from Untac altogether.
UN officials were obliged to woo him constantly and UN Security Council
resolutions contained clauses lauding the prince to try to keep him happy.
On the eve of the election, when it became obvious that the polling would go
ahead in spite of threats by Khmer Rouge guerrillas to disrupt it, he
suddenly returned home to Cambodia.
And when nearly 90 per cent of registered voters ignored the Khmer Rouge
threats, Prince Sihanouk completely reversed his policy of accommodating the
Khmer Rouge, saying it would have no part in a future government.
Prince Sihanouk's performance in his new incarnation as head of state will
be judged partly on how he handles the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, still a
powerful military force in parts of the country. Yesterday he again
suggested that he might attempt to reintegrate them into Cambodian life. He
will also be judged on his attitude towards the democratic institutions
which the UN has tried so hard to introduce.
'As Sihanouk's capacity to influence events diminished, so did his interest
in governing the country,' wrote historian Mr David Chandler in The Tragedy
of Cambodian History in a reference to the period before the coup. 'He took
refuge in the company of his entourage, in feverish provincial tours, in
making films, and occasionally in his passion for haute cuisine.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia yesterday announced the immediate
formation of a new coalition government with himself as head of state, prime
minister and chief of the armed forces.
The prince's declaration was made without consulting the UN Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (Untac) and was given a lukewarm welcome by Mr Yasushi
Akashi, the Untac chief.
One Untac official said privately that Prince Sihanouk's announcement -
which did not say the government was temporary and made no mention of
Untac's continuing mandate in Cambodia - could be seen as a constitutional
coup d'etat.
Prince Sihanouk appointed as deputy prime ministers his son Prince
Ranariddh, who leads the royalist party Funcinpec, and Mr Hun Sen, who was
prime minister in the communist Phnom Penh government, abolished yesterday.
With most of the votes counted after last week's UN - organised election,
Funcinpec has emerged as the strongest political party in the future
Cambodian assembly, which is to draft a new constitution and form a
government within three months under a 1991 Paris peace plan. The Cambodian
People's party (CPP), the old government communist party, came a close
second.
Mr Akashi, summoned to the palace to be told of the new government described
the initiative as 'extremely important' and said it 'could be a necessary
instrument for stability' provided the two main parties supported it.
Funcinpec's reaction was not immediately known last night although Prince
Sihanouk assured Cambodians that his son had given his 'full agreement and
unconditional support.'
The administration remains in the hands of the CPP and a Funcinpec-CPP
coalition is probably the best recipe for peace in Cambodia.
The CPP, which controls the armed forces, discussed the new government with
the prince yesterday. It also seemed ready to drop its challenge to the
election results based on alleged 'irregularities.'
'The CPP wishes to appeal to all compatriots, public servants and all
categories of the armed forces to remain calm and to be pleased with and
optimistic about the national Cambodian government under the high leadership
of his royal highness Norodom Sihanouk,' the party said.
One problem for the CPP could be Prince Sihanouk's suggestion that he wanted
to make peace with the Khmer Rouge, the guerrilla faction which reneged on
the Paris accord and has long fought against the CPP government.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Canadian labour deal may soften newsprint
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD newsprint prices face renewed downward pressure after the expected
approval today of a new labour contract by workers at seven Canadian paper
mills owned by Abitibi-Price of Toronto.
Union leaders have urged workers to accept the five-year contract, setting a
pattern for other eastern Canadian mills without triggering the work
stoppages which usually disrupt newsprint supplies during labour
negotiations.
Uncertainty over the outcome of the contract talks has helped push up
newsprint demand in recent months. Many North American publishers built up
inventories to protect themselves against supply interruptions and a 5-7 per
cent cut in discounts imposed by producers in the eastern US and Canada on
April 1.
An official at Knight-Ridder, the US newspaper group, said the company had
80 days' consumption on hand, against the industry average of 40-45 days.
Strong demand in North America led to a sharp cut in US and Canadian exports
to Europe earlier this year. The gap has largely been filled by Scandinavian
producers, whose competitiveness has been improved by a fall in the value of
the Swedish krona and Finnish markka.
Some Scandinavian producers had been hoping for limited price increases in
the second half of this year if the US market continued to strengthen. But
current North American production appears to be outstripping consumption.
An Abitibi-Price official confirmed that 'we may see a little softness in
the middle of the year'. The company has said it is shifting production of
two machines at its Iroquois, Ontario, mill from newsprint to specialty
groundwood papers and late yesterday it announced production cutbacks
totalling 30,000 tonnes.
According to Mr John Johnson, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in
Vancouver, the New York Times' advertising lineage is 6 per cent lower so
far this year than in 1992, while the Los Angeles Times' lineage is down 10
per cent.
But newsprint mills, especially in Canada, are running at full tilt to meet
the recent run-up in inventories. The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association
will report today that Canadian mills were operating at 99 per cent of
capacity in April, up from 78 per cent in July 1992.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Access talks are key to Uruguay Round
hopes - A four-way open market package is seen as 'within striking distance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT for the first time in the past four years, hopes have leapt in recent
days that agreement is within reach in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of
talks on global trade reform. Negotiators who have been to the brink before,
and failed, are inevitably cautious.
There is more talk on the obstacles that still have to be overcome than on
the headway that has been made in recent months. But as ministers from the
industrialised countries were being told in Paris this week how grave the
world's economic problems were, a consensus has appeared that reforms under
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have
'crucial relevence' if early recovery is to be achieved.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, caught the mood of negotiators in
Paris when he noted: 'We are at last within striking distance of the largest
market access package in history.'
Sir Leon Brittan, his European Community counterpart agreed that it is
'realistic to aim for the outline of an ambitious market access package' by
the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in early July. The aim is to bind the G7
countries into a package of tariff cuts in manufactures and services trade,
and use this as the springboard for wider multilateral agreement. The target
is for a Uruguay agreement by December 15 this year.
Underpinning a quiet, cautious optimism that a deal is within reach is a
sequence of negotiations initiated in January this year by Sir Leon. They
began on New Year's day in secret talks with Mrs Carla Hills, then the US
trade representative. Rather than wrestle with all Uruguay Round issues
simultaneously, the two opted to push for a bilateral market access deal
that would involve deep tariff cuts in a range of manufactures and services.
Sir Leon managed to maintain momentum in spite of the inevitable hiatus
following the change in the US administration. In Toronto a month ago, talks
were broadened to the 'quad' group of the US, the EC, Japan and Canada.
Officials remain secretive about the details of the market access package.
It embraces pharmaceuticals, chemicals, steel, construction equipment,
medical equipment, spirits, beer, textiles, ceramics, glassware, paper,
wood, electronics, non-ferrous metals, farm equipment and scientific
equipment. In the services area, it includes financial services,
telecommunications, transport, audio-visual services, and labour migration.
Officials stress that while this covers the sectors under discussion, it is
unlikely that agreements can be reached in all areas.
Last week, Japan outlined in talks with US counterparts new concessions to
open up its financial services sector. These proposals were put before EC
negotiators in Geneva yesterday. They could be of immense importance in
rallying support in Europe and the US for the wider Uruguay Round package,
since both are expected to gain significantly from liberalisation of
financial services.
Perhaps most critically, they could be important in swinging the French
government behind an agreement. Fierce French opposition to proposals for
reform of farm trade could be offset by significant liberalisation in
financial services, since France is the world's second-largest services
exporter.
Sir Leon warned in Paris on Wednesday, at the end of a meeting of 'quad'
ministers, that if outline agreement was to be secured before the Tokyo
summit 'it must involve every participant being ready to move and do things
which will not necessarily be easy'.
Notably, the US will need to lower protection for its textiles industry. US
negotiators will also need to assure other G7 countries that they have won
unconditional 'fast track' authority to present a 'take it or leave it' deal
to Congress.
The EC must cut tariffs on electronics products, and will need to lower
barriers to foreign films and television programmes.
Japan is under pressure to open its market to more rice imports. It is
understood that no concessions are likely before the G7 summit, though
negotiators hope Japan will bend to pressure in the multilateral
negotiations that would follow a successful G7 outcome.
Between now and the Tokyo summit, negotiators are scheduled to meet
virtually non-stop. A critical sequence of meetings in Tokyo culminate in a
'quad' summit on June 23-24.
What is significant is that 'quad' ministers invited Mr Arthur Dunkel,
director general of Gatt, to brief them in Paris this week on how a G7
agreement could be broadened to embrace all 111 Gatt members. Also present
in Paris was Mr Peter Sutherland, who is expected to succeed Mr Dunkel at
the end of this month, and who would play a critical part in managing
multilateral negotiations in the wake of the G7 summit.
By this stage, a range of new obstacles will face negotiators. The 14 farm
produce exporting countries organised into the Cairns Group have already
made it clear that the US-EC agreement on farm trade reform reached at Blair
House in Washington in November must provide a 'rock bottom minimum' for the
agriculture section of the Uruguay Round agreement to be acceptable. Japan,
which has come under increasing unilateral pressure from the US to set
targets for bringing its trade with the US into balance, is spearheading
efforts to include in the Uruguay Round package clear commitments to use the
multilateral Gatt forum to settle trade disputes. This is aimed in
particular at Washington's 'Section 301' laws, which are at the heart of an
armoury of unilateral trade sanctions that are of increasing concern to US
trade partners.
Japan in turn will come under pressure to agree to 'tariffication without
exception' in the Uruguay Round package - a commitment that would force it
to open its domestic rice market to foreign competition, albeit behind high
tariff walls.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC seeks to tighten Japanese car curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is to ask Japan to limit still further exports of
cars and light commercial vehicles to the EC in 1993, following a
significant fall in demand.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has written to Mr Yoshiro
Mori, the Japanese minister for trade and industry, requesting urgent talks
before the August break, aimed at revising the April deal on 1993 imports.
The Japanese agreed then, in effect, to cut exports to the EC of cars and
light commercial vehicles by 9.4 per cent - roughly 113,000 vehicles - on
the basis of a European Commission forecast that EC car sales would decline
by 6.5 per cent this year.
Mr Bangemann said in April that the figures might need to be revised.
Commission officials refuse to forecast the expected decline in the market
this year and no figure is mentioned in Mr Bangemann's letter. But the
officials point out that new vehicle registrations in the first four months
of this year dropped by 17.8 per cent. The EC industry estimates that sales
could decline by as much as 15 per cent over the year.
'It would need an explosion in (EC) demand to meet our original forecasts,'
one senior Commission official conceded yesterday.
The Commission has come under intense pressure from the EC industry -
notably Mr Jacques Calvet, head of Peugeot-Citroen of France - and the
French, Italian and Spanish governments to adjust the April agreement. Acea,
which represents all EC manufacturers except Peugeot, said yesterday the two
sides would have to act quickly if an adjustment was to have an effect.
The April accord was based on the controversial July 1991 'understanding'
between the EC and Japan, under which the Community pledged to open its
market to full competition from Japanese vehicles by the end of the century.
A renegotiated accord would still allow for an increase in Japanese exports
this year to the five protected EC markets - the UK, France, Spain, Portugal
and Italy.
Officials in Brussels expect Japanese manufacturers to compensate for import
cuts in the rest of the Community by redirecting EC-made Japanese vehicles -
so-called 'transplants' - from the protected market to the remaining seven
countries. Transplant vehicles are not covered directly by the July 1991
deal but are 'taken into consideration'.

FT  04 JUN 93 / World Trade News: ECGD resumes exportcover to Argentina

BRITAIN'S Export Credits Guarantee Department is resuming export insurance
cover to Argentina, 11 years after its suspension following the 1982
Falklands conflict and the onset of Argentina's decade-long debt crisis,
writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, who is on an official
visit to Argentina, said this had been made possible by the 'substantial
improvement in the way Argentina has been servicing its debts'.
British exporters have been clamouring for ECGD cover as economic conditions
improve in Argentina. Although Argentina's free market reforms have led to a
substantial increase in imports, British sales remain depressed; exports
rose to Pounds 118.7m in 1992 from Pounds 69.7m in 1991.
Exporters are likely to be disappointed by the Pounds 100m ceiling on
coverage and the high premiums, expected to be in the range of 14 per cent.
Officials said this reflected Argentina's poor debt repayment record and
high risk of insolvency or non-payment.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Civil rights nomination places Clinton in 'lose-lose'
dilemma: Lani Guinier has been left out to dry by the White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE cannot have been the happiest days in the life of Ms Lani Guinier. She
spent most of Wednesday talking to leading newspapers and appearing on
television making an articulate case for her qualifications as the new
assistant attorney-general in charge of civil rights. She woke up yesterday
to a united media chorus proclaiming that President Bill Clinton had
concluded that her nomination would have to be withdrawn.
Mr Clinton, who badly needs to win some battles, seems to have come round to
the view that her nomination had put him in a 'lose-lose' position and it
was merely a matter of settling on the least bad political option. Either
way, his White House is again under fire for bad judgment and political
mismanagement.
A series of recent actions, exemplified by the recruitment to the White
House of Mr David Gergen, the former adviser to Republican presidents,
suggest a shift back to the political centre. But sacrificing well-known
beliefs, including a very progressive record on civil rights, has an awful
air of expediency about it.
There is also a personal element to the controversy. Ms Guinier went to Yale
Law School with the president and his wife and became quite close to Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton. They attended her small private wedding in 1986.
Their general commitment to civil rights certainly matched hers, if not, as
Mr Clinton insists, down to the fine print of all her writings.
It is hard to argue against the proposition that Ms Guinier was left out to
dry by the White House. There were plenty of early warnings in the
conservative media, especially Wall Street Journal editorials, that her long
academic paper trail was stirring up opposition, with accusations that she
was a 'quota queen' intent on abandoning the principles of majority rule for
complex proportional formulae.
Comparisons were freely made between her case and that of Mr Robert Bork,
the conservative academic denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate in 1987.
In both instances opponents have targeted their real or imagined radicalism
and ignored their intellectual qualities.
Yet the White House did not press her cause, as the Reagan administration
did Mr Bork's, until the bitter end. It did not smooth her path by arranging
necessary preliminary meetings with swing senators. Perhaps too conscious of
the controversy surrounding the recent confirmation to the housing
department of Ms Roberta Achtenberg, who is openly lesbian, it allowed Ms
Guinier's critics, who scented blood, to call the tune.
Mr Clinton himself came close to pulling the rug on Wednesday with the most
tepid of endorsements. Yet earlier in the week, Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, had typically stood solidly behind Ms Guinier as 'a superb
choice'. Not for the first time, communications between the White House and
Justice Department seemed lacking.
Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of a finely divided judiciary committee, is
known to have been worried that another black woman would be subject to the
sort of public trial visited on Professor Anita Hill in the hearings on the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
But Ms Guinier insisted on Wednesday that, like Mr Bork, she at least should
be given the congressional forum to explain herself.
She maintained, with some force, that the often dense and theoretical nature
of academic writing was no foolproof guide to the practical implementation
of the laws of the land, with which, as a past legal counsel to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), she also had
considerable familiarity.
But the painful choice for Mr Clinton has come down to this: to abandon Ms
Guinier, offending his liberal political supporters and fostering the
impression that he backs down in the heat of battle, but hoping that Ms
Guinier, like Ms Zoe Baird, the first attorney-general nominee, is quickly
forgotten; or to stick with her, as a friend whose views on civil rights are
not far from his own, but thus risk a bruising public debate at precisely
the time he needs to focus on winning the backing of the centre for an
acceptable budget package.

FT  04 JUN 93 / US hand stirs controversy in Bolivian election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN and agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of peaceful but intense campaigning, Bolivia's general election
due this Sunday has been hit by last-minute controversy, write Chris
Philipsborn and agencies in La Paz. The American embassy in La Paz has gone
public in its attempts to force a parliamentary candidate from President
Jaime Paz Zamora's ruling coalition to stand down, alleging that he is
linked to prominent drug traffickers.
The embassy has alleged that Mr Guillermo Capobianco, a former interior
minister in the current government, received bribes, including the sum of
Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) in 1991, in return for freeing imprisoned
drug barons.
So far the candidate of the main opposition MNR party, Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada, a mining executive with a degree from the University of Chicago,
leads in the opinion polls. However, his main opponent, the country's former
dictator General Hugo Banzer Suarez, the ruling coalition candidate, is
catching up fast.
The controversy over Mr Capobianco could have an impact on Gen Banzer
Suarez's campaign. Mr Capobianco is so far braving the US criticism - itself
a controversial and risky intervention in the region's internal politics.
An estimated 1.8m Bolivians will choose from among 14 different political
parties to elect a new president on Sunday. The leading contestants, along
with Mr Sanchez de Lozada and Gen Banzer Suarez, are two newer populist
politicians - beer magnate Mr Max Fernandez and Mr Carlos Palenque, the
owner of a national television and radio station.
However, Bolivia's quirky constitution means the man who gets the most votes
in the presidential poll may well not be the next president. If, as is
likely, no one candidate secures more than half the vote, congress will
decide by secret ballot in August who should be president from the three
leading contenders.
The campaign has so far been largely peaceful in a country once considered
the most unstable in Latin America. After 16 governments in 18 years of
military rule, ending in 1982, Bolivia has been run by elected governments.
The elections are also being billed as the cleanest in Bolivian history
after the naming of a new five-person electoral court with the backing of
all political parties. Heading the court is Mr Huascar Cajias, a prominent
lawyer, editor and founder of the Roman Catholic La Paz daily Presencia.
Previous courts, beholden to ruling political parties, were accused of
widespread favouritism and corruption.
Aware of the electorate's growing dissatisfaction with party politics, many
presidential candidates have made corruption, education and employment their
three main campaign priorities.
The new president will inherit a mixed economic picture. The government of
President Paz Zamora succeeded in keeping inflation down to 11 per cent last
year and to a projected 9 per cent in 1993. Growth was around 3.4 per cent
in 1992. Net reserves are now over Dollars 200m, up from Dollars 23m when Mr
Paz Zamora took office in 1989. The government has also passed progressive
laws, such as a new mining code facilitating foreign investment.
The state sector is another matter. A privatisation programme begun last
year has been disappointing because of the poor quality of the companies on
offer. President Paz Zamora has failed to reform the public sector,
particularly the state mining corporation Comibol. Depressed world prices
for base metals mean Comibol may have to close all but one of its mining
operations by the end of the year.
In part because of the delays in modernising the state, the government has
run a fiscal deficit averaging 4 per cent of gross domestic product during
the lifetime of the present government. Failure to keep the deficit in check
meant Bolivia could not keep to the terms of the fourth year of its extended
structural adjustment facility agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
Some economists are also worried about a growing trade deficit; the 1992
shortfall of Dollars 410m was the largest in nearly a decade and the pattern
for 1993 suggests more of the same
Bolivia remains dependent on support from international financial
institutions. Thus any future government's room for economic manoeuvre is
limited - perhaps as a result of this the declared economic policies of all
the main candidates are strikingly similar.
Both Mr Sanchez de Lozada and Gen Banzer Suarez say they are are in favour
of what they call 'capitalisation' - the hiving off to the private sector of
minority stakes in larger state enterprises - rather than full-scale
privatisation. Yet all are broadly in favour of prolonging an austerity
programme now in its eighth year.

FT  04 JUN 93 / FDA acts on aids to quit smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Food and Drug Administration has ruled there is no evidence that
non-prescription products to help smokers quit actually work, and they are
to be withdrawn from December.
'These products are safe enough,' said Mr Mike Shaffer, a public affairs
officer at the FDA. 'But there is no evidence that they work. We're not
saying they don't work, just that we don't know if they do.'
The products, supported by millions of dollars of advertising, include
Cigarrest, Bantron, Tabmint and Nikoban. Tabmint, a chewing gum containing
silver acetate and which is supposed to make smoke taste unpleasant, is
available in Britain.
The withdrawn products do not include Nicorette gum and nicotine patches
which, although available without a prescription in the UK, are not
available over the counter (OTC) in the US.
The US move led to calls yesterday in the UK for all OTC smoking cessation
products to be withdrawn, including patches and nicotine gums.
Ms Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, a charity dedicated to helping smokers
give up, said there was no evidence any products worked when bought at a
chemist without a prescription.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Guatemalan confusion over Serrano successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GUATEMALA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUATEMALA'S political system was in confusion yesterday over who would
succeed Mr Jorge Serrano, who left the country this week after being deposed
as president.
Mr Gustavo Espina, Guatemala's acting president and former vice-president,
was prevented from taking office late on Wednesday night because of
congressional opposition. He needed a majority of Congress's 117 members to
approve his swearing in, but only 44 turned out in support.
Mr Espina delivered a populist speech to Congress calling on it to purge
corrupt members. He said he would donate the president's unaccountable
'confidential expenses' - by which the president buys votes in Congress - to
social services. He asked for his ministerial colleagues to resign.
Mr Serrano attempted to seize authoritarian powers and suspend the
constitution last week, but found himself deposed by the military.
Instability may grow if the succession issue is not resolved soon.
Mr Espina does not appear to have the support of the private sector, unions
or main political parties. 'The best thing that Espina can do is resign,'
said Mr Peter Lamport, a representative of the private sector coalition
Cacif.
A constitutional court is examining whether Mr Espina's support for Mr
Serrano's attempted 'self coup' violated the constitution. If it did, Mr
Espina would be legally excluded from the presidency.
Mr Edgar Tuna Valladares, attorney-general, has opened proceedings against
Mr Serrano, Mr Espina and Mr Francisco Perdomo, minister of the interior,
'to determine responsibility in the interruption of constitutional order'.
The rejection of Mr Espina has created a problem for the military, which
denied on Wednesday that he had resigned. On Tuesday General Jose Domingo
Garca Samayoa, defence minister, said Mr Espina would remain acting
president in order to avoid a legal vacuum until a purged Congress was able
to meet and accept his resignation.
The military's ambiguity is said to be causing internal divisions. But
observers believe it is unlikely the army will adopt strong-arm tactics
after covering its actions until now under a veil of legality.

Since January authorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted

FT  04 JUN 93 / Salinas pledges crusade against drug traffickers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY CONGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S President Carlos Salinas has called for a 'national crusade'
against the drugs trade, promising to establish an elite anti-narcotics unit
to fight the war on all fronts, including money laundering and arms
trafficking.
His call on Wednesday came nine days after the killing of Roman Catholic
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, who was shot, apparently by drug
traffickers, at Guadalajara airport.
The new unit, to be formed by the Attorney-General's office, is to be
equipped with the latest technology and trained in the most sophisticated
investigation techniques.
Mr Salinas also said he would launch constitutional reforms aimed at
toughening penalties against drug criminals and tightening procedures to
confiscate their property.
Meanwhile, the investigation into the murder of Cardinal Posadas unearthed a
large tunnel on Wednesday, apparently designed as a conduit for passing
drugs under the Mexico-US border.
The tunnel begins under a large warehouse by the Tijuana international
airport and runs for 350 metres towards a building site on the US side of
the border.
The tunnel was found as police combed Tijuana looking for gangsters who fled
to the border city after the Guadalajara killing.
Growing scepticism over the official explanation of the shootings at
Guadalajara, which claimed seven victims, is increasing pressure on the
Salinas administration to produce results.
Roman Catholic bishops, opposition politicians and political analysts
challenge the government's claim that the cardinal, who died from 14 bullet
wounds in the chest, was the accidental victim of drug traffickers who
mistook him for the leader of one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs.
Mr Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological
Institute of Mexico, said such scepticism fuelled doubts about the
government's ability to reign in drug traffickers as well as to control
rogue former or present members of the security apparatus.
Drug-related violence has increased sharply in recent months, claiming the
lives of a former state prosecutor and magistrate and dozens of others
killed in shoot-outs between rival gangs.
Some observers speculate the cardinal's killing may have been a message from
elements in the security forces irritated by recent measures aimed at
combating corruption linked to drugs.

FT  04 JUN 93 / US coal strike targets Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Mine Workers of America expanded its selective strike against US
coal operators yesterday, stopping work at Peabody Coal mines in Illinois,
Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio. Peabody, the largest coal producer in the
US, is a subsidiary of Hanson of the UK.
The union also ordered workers at four mines owned by Consol Energy, which
is jointly owned by DuPont and Germany's Rheinbraun, to join picket lines.
The strike began on May 10 when national contract negotiations broke down
between the union and mine owners represented by the Bituminous Coal
Operators' Association.
The dispute is far from shutting down US coal operations. Following
yesterday's action, 9,200 UMWA members are on strike, leaving more than
50,000 still working. The union's workers control only 28 per cent of US
coal output nationwide, with the BCOA companies producing about 17 per cent
of US coal, mostly in eastern and mid-western states.
While the percentage of nationwide production under the union's workers is
small, coal operations are regional, with customers such as electricity
utilities dependent on cheap local sources of coal. Utilities in strike-hit
regions have ample coal supplies, but may have to switch to other fuel
sources if the dispute drags on, analysts say.
The union is seeking greater job security for its members and has accused
BCOA companies of evading agreements by using non-unionised subsidiaries to
open new mines. It believes that a 1988 agreement with the BCOA guarantees
union jobs in new mines.
Mr Thomas Hoffman, a BCOA spokesman, said the union's demands were
unreasonable.
'Nobody these days is going to guarantee jobs,' he said. The coal operators
had offered the union three out of five new jobs at new mines once 40 per
cent of the workforce had been hired.
Mr Hoffman said there had been no talks between the two sides since the
strike began, and none was scheduled.
Mr Richard Trumka, UMWA president, said the BCOA's latest offer 'represents
an even further pulling back on their commitment to workers'.
A union appeal for international support met some success this week when
1,000 miners at Peabody mines in Australia went on strike in sympathy with
the UMWA .

The proposal has encountered intense criticism from opposition parties and
trade unions as well as discomfort among the cabinet and on the coalition
backbenches for being too lenient. Self-employed and non-PAYE higher rate
taxpayers, who will be the main benficiaries of the amnesty, will
effectively pay less than a third of the original tax liability occurring on
previously undeclared income.
The government, however, believes that as much as IPounds 2bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
could be repatriated to Ireland by the measure, further improving liquidity
and lowering interest rates, and giving a much-needed boost to economic
activity and employment prospects.
Senior officials in the Revenue Commissioners and the Finance Ministry are
believed to have advised against the proposal, concerned that the amnesty,
the second on income tax in five years, will encourage future
non-compliance. The previous amnesty netted IPounds 500m.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister said in the Dail (parliament) this
week that the amnesty will be balanced with a similar amnesty for those
working but claiming social welfare, and by harsh penalties including
imprisonment, for future tax offenders.
Legislation to effect the proposal will be presented to the Dail within two
weeks, according to the Finance Ministry, and is expected to be on the
statute books before the summer recess.

UKRAINIAN Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said yesterday that Ukraine should,
at least temporarily, become a nuclear power, according to MPs who listened
to his speech at a closed session of parliament.
Mr Kuchma, former director of the world's largest missile factory, urged
parliament to ratify the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, which covers 130
of the 146 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles on Ukrainian territory, but
to postpone accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a
non-nuclear state.
'Ukraine must confirm itself temporarily as a nuclear state,' one MP quoted
Mr Kuchma as saying. The 46 ICBMs Mr Kuchma suggests Ukraine should
temporarily keep were built at his factory in the Ukrainian city of
Dnipropetrovsk.
According to MPs, Mr Kuchma also said that Ukraine has the technical
capacity to develop operational control over the 46 SS-24s on its territory.
Currently, all the ICBMs stationed in Ukraine are under Russian control, but
Mr Kuchma's statement suggests that Ukrainian leaders may be seeking to
develop independent nuclear capacity.
Mr Kuchma's speech is the first time a Ukrainian government official has
openly called for Ukraine to become a nuclear power, even temporarily.
His position, which earned him tumultuous applause from the legislature,
could be the harbinger of a major toughening of the Ukrainian policy on
nuclear weapons.
While asking for security guarantees and financial compensation, in the past
the Ukrainian government has categorically asserted that it would ratify
both Start 1 and the NPT.
But Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign
affairs, said that now Ukraine would hold out for air-tight security
guarantees before giving up all of its nuclear missiles.
'We can consider accession to the NPT, but only when we have an air-tight
treaty on security guarantees,' Mr Pavlychko said. 'The west will not want
to give us such guarantees and it will take a long time before they come
around.
'We want to drag out the disarmament process,' he said. 'Not just for seven
years (the period specified by Start 1) but for much longer.'
It is unclear whether Mr Kuchma's assertion is a reflection of his own
perspective as a former maker of missiles, or signals a wider change in
government policy.
Just a few hours earlier, the Foreign Minister Anatoli Zlenko had urged MPs
to ratify both Start 1 and NPT, warning that failure to do so could carry
serious international repercussions.
Mr Kuchma's break with the official government line lends credence to the
concerns recently expressed by US officials that Ukraine could be seeking
independent control over its nuclear arsenal.
The prime minister's statement, which came on the eve of a visit to Kiev by
the Russian foreign minister and a few days before US defence secretary Les
Aspin is due to come to Kiev, is likely to exacerbate Ukraine's already
strained relations with both the US and Russia.

<TEXT>
SERBIAN authorities yesterday moved against the country's democratic
opposition, seeking a ban on the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Mr Vuk
Draskovic.
The Belgrade prosecutor asked the constitutional court to ban the SPO, on
the grounds that it had 'violently instigated the overthrow of
constitutional order'. The request, coming two days after police forcibly
broke up an anti-government demonstration, signalled that Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian president, intends to clamp down heavily on the
opposition.
Earlier in the day Mr Draskovic, the SPO leader, was taken from police
headquarters to a Belgrade prison.
A party spokesman said that lawyers had been unable to contact Mr Draskovic,
who was badly beaten after being arrested on Wednesday. His wife, Danitsa,
was also detained. However, 20 other members of his Serbian Renewal
Movement, also arrested when police broke into the party's headquarters,
were released.
Mr Draskovic was leading a demonstration protesting at the dismissal of Mr
Dobrica Cosic, the federal president, in a parliamentary vote of no
confidence.
Mr Cosic broke his silence after the demonstration, accusing President
Milosevic, his former political ally, of 'tyrannical behaviour.'
He said Mr Milosevic had distorted an account of a routine meeting with the
army leadership.
Mr Cosic was accused in parliament by members of Mr Milosevic's Serbian
Socialist Party of planning to overthrow the government.

UNITED Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro are now being
successfully enforced on the Danube, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, said yesterday after visiting Romanian and Bulgarian river ports,
writes Virginia Marsh in Ruse, Bulgaria.
'The checks on documentation at different points do in effect prevent
illegal traffic. The riverside is greatly improved,' he said. However,
British officials travelling with Mr Hurd said the embargo was still not
tight enough at land crossings, especially in Macedonia.
Mr Hurd, who is on a four-day visit to the Balkans, said Britain would
provide three of the eight patrol boats which the Western European Union
agreed last month to deploy on the Danube in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.
The WEU aims to have the boats, as well as 300-400 police and customs
officials, monitoring the Danube by the end of the month.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Ukrainian MPs urged to ratify Start 1 treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Ukrainian leaders yesterday urged MPs to ratify the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (Start 1) on nuclear disarmament on the first day of what
is likely to be a protracted parliamentary debate of the issue.
The US, which has become increasingly concerned about Kiev's failure to
fulfil its pledge to ratify the arms pact, is likely to take heart from the
Ukrainian leadership's strongly anti-nuclear stance and from the fact that
parliament has finally begun to discuss the Start 1 agreement and the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
But they could be concerned at reported remarks by Prime Minister Leonid
Kuchma to a closed parliamentary session, in which he said that Ukraine
should declare itself a nuclear state and temporarily keep a part of the
former Soviet nuclear arsenal, according to deputies attending the meeting.
Ukrainian government officials emphasised that the treaties will only be put
to a vote after extensive parliamentary debate.
Judging by the overwhelmingly hostile reaction of MPs to the government's
position, Ukrainian officials face an uphill battle.
Western leaders are worried that Ukraine's hesitation to ratify the Start 1
treaty and the associated Lisbon protocol, which would remove all nuclear
weapons from Ukrainian territory, and to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear
state, could undermine the international disarmament process.
'Ukraine is acquiring an image as an unreliable partner in international
relations,' Mr Anatoli Zlenko, foreign minister, told MPs, urging them to
ratify the treaties.
'There is no doubt that reaction in the West will be decisive in any attempt
by Ukraine to become a nuclear state,' he said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Swiss pacifist sentiments put to the test: Ian Rodger
considers the key issues in Sunday's referendum on defence requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MOST western countries, defence ministry experts are still struggling to
assess their future needs in the light of the end of the cold war.
In Switzerland, where direct democracy is a way of life, the people will
decide in two national referendums this Sunday on the purchase of new
fighter aircraft for the air force and the allocation of land to the army
for training purposes.
Of course, a large proportion of the voters has a special knowledge of, and
interest in, the issues; every able bodied adult male serves in the
country's militia army for an average of three weeks every two years until
he is 50.
If the votes had been held a few months ago, there is little doubt that
pacifist sentiment would have carried the day.
It was only a year ago that the Group for a Switzerland without an Army
(GSoA) whipped up nearly 200,000 signatures in only 12 days - a record  -
for its petition to block the government's plan to buy 34 McDonnell-Douglas
F/A-18 fighters for SFr3.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
'The dangers facing Switzerland now are above all economic, social and
ecological,' said Mr Andreas Gross, the soft-spoken socialist
parliamentarian who heads the GSoA. 'We cannot be threatened militarily
except in the context of a European war, and that is implausible,' he
claimed.
It was a beguiling argument at a time when the country was in recession,
government deficits were ballooning and the collapse of the Soviet threat
made the traditional Swiss policy of heavily armed neutrality look obsolete.
And the GSoA was thrilled to have an unexpected opportunity to build on its
moral victory in a 1989 referendum. Then, to the shock of the military
establishment, a GSoA plebiscite calling for the abolition of the army was
supported by a third of those voting.
However, with the fighting in Bosnia veering out of control and unnerving
racial strife springing up in neighbouring Germany, voter sentiment appears
to have changed. Recent polls indicate that a narrow majority of Swiss are
probably inclined to agree with their political and military leaders that,
as in the past, it would be wise to be prepared for any eventuality.
'At the moment, no one threatens us directly,' says Mr Jean-Francois Leuba,
a Liberal parliamentarian. 'But the situation can change very rapidly. Who
would have imagined that Britain and Argentina would have fought over the
Falklands? Nobody foresaw the fall of the Berlin wall or the war in
Yugoslavia.'
The debate in the run-up to Sunday's votes has been typically Swiss -
gentlemanly and thorough. The pacifists have argued that no airborne threat
could get to Switzerland without having first to pass through allied
countries. The military chiefs warned against relying on allies to provide
cover and policing of the skies. 'If we do not defend our air space, Nato
will,' predicts Commandant de Corps Fernand Carrel, head of the air force.
'And it will do so without taking our interests into account,' he adds.
Neither side appears to have seriously dented the convictions or the
credibility of the other, but that is perhaps in the nature of the subject.
If the votes do go narrowly in favour of the military, the GSoA will be
blamed for having exaggerated the terms of its petition. Not content with
simply seeking to veto the F/A-18 purchase, it added a clause that would put
a moratorium on any fighter purchase until the year 2000.
This has frustrated a large number of Swiss who support the principle of a
credible air force but doubt the wisdom of buying a very expensive fighter
that is unlikely to be able to avoid crossing an international border within
only a few seconds of taking off.
Mr Gross denies that the wording of the petition was part of the GSoA's
strategy gradually to kill off the army by a thousand tiny cuts. Rather, he
says disingenuously, it was to prevent the military from rushing into an
alternative aircraft purchase without a full evaluation.
Whatever the outcome, the Swiss will have more opportunities to vote on
military matters. The GSoA has petitions in the works to halve annual
military spending, now the largest in Europe at SFr750 per capita, to reduce
the number of air force airports and to eliminate the special tax on those
who do not serve their time.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government is to press ahead with a controversial tax amnesty
bill, which will permit tax evaders to repatriate funds held abroad or in
non-resident accounts in Ireland, by paying only a 15 per cent levy in
settlement of any outstanding, but as-yet undeclared tax liabilities prior
to April 1991.
The proposal has encountered intense criticism from opposition parties and
trade unions as well as discomfort among the cabinet and on the coalition
backbenches for being too lenient. Self-employed and non-PAYE higher rate
taxpayers who will be the main benficiaries of the amnesty, will effectively
pay less than a third of the original tax liability occurring on previously
undeclared income.
The government, however, believes that as much as IPounds 2bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
could be repatriated to Ireland by the measure, further improving liquidity
and lowering interest rates, and giving a much-needed boost to economic
activity and employment prospects.
Senior officials in the Revenue Commissioners and the Finance Ministry are
believed to have advised against the proposal, concerned that the amnesty,
the second on income tax in five years, will encourage future
non-compliance. The previous amnesty netted IPounds 500m. Mr Bertie Ahern,
the finance minister said in the Dail (parliament) this week that the
amnesty will be balanced with a similar amnesty for those working but
claiming social welfare, and by harsh penalties including imprisonment, for
future tax offenders.
Legislation to effect the proposal will be presented to the Dail within two
weeks, according to the Finance Ministry, and is expected to be on the
statute books before the summer recess.
In another development, the government's taxation policy has been sharply
criticised by the Central Bank, which in its annual report published
yesterday said that 'a significant part' of the rise in Irish unemployment
in the 1980s 'was due to factors within the control of the authorities'.
Most important of these was 'the worsening of the tax wedge - the difference
between the gross cost of labour to the employer and the employee's
take-home pay'. The Bank says that there is a need for tax reform 'to
stimulate the demand for labour and to improve work incentives'.
The report also predicts that Irish gross national product will grow by 2
per cent in 1993.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Inquiry to probe ship collision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN official inquiry is to be launched into the tanker collision off the
Belgian coast which killed nine people early yesterday morning and brought
renewed calls for greater safety at sea.
British Petroleum, the tanker's owner, will conduct a separate
investigation.
The British Trent, leaving Antwerp with a 24,000-tonne cargo of petrol,
collided with the Panamanian-registered bulk carrier Western Winner in thick
fog eight miles off the coast. The tanker's hull was punctured, releasing
blazing petrol into the sea.
Although many crewmen swam to safety, seven were burned to death and two are
missing, believed dead.
Petrol leaking into the sea prompted environmental concerns, but BP said it
would burn off or evaporate.
The Bermuda-registered British Trent had 12 European officers, including a
British master, and 17 Sierra Leonean crew. There were also five cadets and
two wives on board. Insurance for pollution and personal liability is
carried by Britannia P &amp; I, the tanker industry's mutual insurance club. The
hull and machinery are insured at Lloyd's.
The inquiry is bound to focus on why the ships collided when both had
sophisticated radar equipment.
The disaster comes nine days after the London-based International Maritime
Organisation backed proposals for improving safety in response to increasing
tanker accidents.

COFFINS of five Turks killed in a racist attack in Solingen, Germany, are
carried yesterday in front of their burnt-out house. Several thousand people
gathered in front of Cologne's largest mosque to mourn their deaths, writes
Ariane Genillard. Addressing the crowd, President Richard von Weizsacker -
Chancellor Helmut Kohl stayed away - called on Germany's 1.8m Turks to be
granted dual citizenship. 'We do not want to stamp as foreigners those who
for years and decades have proven that Germany is also their home.' The
president also clearly pointed to political motives behind the series of
racist attacks. Later in the day, more than 20 young people were arrested
after further race-based rioting in Cologne and other German cities.

FT  04 JUN 93 / OECD to open its doors to Mexico: OECD, Paris 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's leading industrial countries yesterday decided to allow Mexico
to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
in a move that will expand the membership of the 'rich nations club' for the
first time in 20 years.
The announcement, coming at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting in the
French capital, added an upbeat note to proceedings that had already
received a boost from progress towards completing the long stalled Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
These two events offset in part the gloom caused by the continuing rise in
unemployment in the organisation's 24 member-nations towards a forecast 36m
by the end of this year.
The ministers 'invited' Mexico and the OECD to examine 'with Mexico the
terms and conditions of its membership with a view towards early entry'.
According to Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer who chaired the
meeting, Mexico could be the 25th OECD member state in 12 to 18 months.
The OECD also held out the prospect of South Korea becoming a member at a
later date, to be followed at some point further in the future by Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic.
Mexico's application for membership was supported strongly by the US and
Canada and came after the rejection of a move by Germany to accelerate the
entry of the east European countries into the organisation.
The meeting also recommended a catalogue of macroeconomic, structural and
labour market policies to encourage non-inflationary growth and ease
unemployment.
However, Mr Dawkins acknowledged that 'nobody suggests it (cutting
unemployment) will be easy or the remedies quick'.
He said, nevertheless, that the determination shown by the OECD countries to
complete the Uruguay Round by the end of this year should boost business
confidence.
According to Mr Peter Cook, the Australian trade minister, the communique
contained 'probably the strongest commitment yet' of the OECD countries to
completing the round and was a reflection of their 'steely determination' to
have an agreement by the year's end.

FT  04 JUN 93 / A saviour comes to Valencia: Peter Bruce hears Aznar tell
30,000 people what they want to hear - it is all right to be conservative in
Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIRTY thousand people pushed and shoved to get inside the grand old
bullring in the middle of Valencia. A third never made it and stood cheering
outside. It was the biggest rally of the Spanish election campaign. The air
throbbed with the party anthem.
When Jose Mara Aznar entered the arena, his bodyguards struggling to stop
screaming supporters mobbing him, the roar was so loud the place shook.
'Pre-si-den-te]', they shouted, 'Pre-si-den-te]'
The welcome was both uplifting and frightening. Here was a mild and ordinary
man, leader of the centre-right People's party (PP) and favourite to win the
election on Sunday, being embraced and hailed as if he were a saviour.
There was change in the air in Valencia on Wednesday night. In the great
Left-Right see-saw of Spanish politics, the Right are coming back. 'Vamos a
ganar,' the crowd shouts, 'vamos a gobernar.' We are going to win, we are
going to govern] Valencia, once a Socialist redoubt, will be taken by the
PP.
The crowd is warmed up by the mayor, Ms Rita Barbera, who attacks the
Socialists for building a high-speed train line to Seville not to Valencia.
'And,' she says, 'because of the negligence of Felipe Gonzalez, Valencia
missed out on two big projects - Euronews and Eurodisney.' Not everyone
understood but they roared all the same.
Former French president Valery Giscard D'Estaing, got up to 'give testimony
of my friendship, solidarity and esteem to Spain, the People's party and
Jose Mara Aznar'.
The crowd became a bit irritable with Mr Giscard's poor Spanish but he ended
well, comparing his presence with the alternativa - a bullfighter's first
real fight, where the novice is given the first bull of the evening. This is
always 'confirmed' by a fight in Madrid.
Mr Aznar's alternativa would be confirmed in Madrid on Friday (Mr Aznar's
last rally), 'and on Sunday in all of Spain. He will be carried out shoulder
high through the big gate]'
Then Mr Aznar strode on to the platform to the PP anthem and 30,000
Valencianos chanting To-re-ro, to-re-ro.
He spoke for about 45 minutes. The speech, devoid of policy content, was
perfect for the occasion and Mr Aznar has become good at it. Over and over,
he finds ways to repeat his same message - the Socialists are corrupt,
inefficient, wasteful. Socialism is dead.
He had been in Brussels at a meeting of centre-right leaders. 'All of them,'
he cries, 'from Chancellor Kohl to (a tiny pause) the Belgian prime minister
want a PP victory.'
Cadence is everything in the Aznar speech. When he raises his voice, they
cheer, and they have come to cheer. They want to hear someone tell them it
is all right now to be a conservative in Spain and that 'their' time has
come again. The faces are younger and hungrier than those at a Socialist
rally.
Behind him, a group of people start chanting 'Felipe el corrupto, Felipe el
corrupto,' and he rounds on them sternly. 'No no no,' he says wagging a
finger. 'I will not have any of that.' This is his moment to be
conciliatory. 'We are nice people,' he says.
But he is quickly back on the attack. 'Why were the Socialists in France
kicked out of power?' he asks. 'For unemployment and corruption. And why are
they going to be kicked out here? For unemployment and corruption.' Down
below with the guests, Mr Giscard applauds.
'I want more jobs, more businesses, more competitiveness, more
productivity,' Mr Aznar says. 'We need austerity, not waste; jobs, not a
government that brags about how well it looks after the jobless.'
He apologises for having to stop. He is tired. He promises to come back when

FT  04 JUN 93 / Strike call at Bank of France
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing most of the Bank of France's 17,189 employees have
called a one-day strike next Tuesday. It is in support of demands for
guarantees that the central bank's activities not be cut back once it gets
autonomy in monetary policy-making.
The unions said they had nothing against Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank's
governor, who fought off Treasury pressure for for commercial bank
regulation to be transferred from the central bank to a new body. But, a
union spokeswoman said, 'we only have oral assurances (about maintaining the
scope of the bank's activities) from the governor, who himself only has oral
assurances from the government and the Treasury'.
Amendments to the government's draft bill to make the bank independent in
setting monetary policy - as eventually required by the Maastricht treaty -
have been proposed by the unions. They are intended to bolster the central
bank's monopoly in printing the nation's money, lay down that one of the two
deputy governors be chosen from within the staff, and endorse its role in
keeping financial data on all French companies.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Concern over growth and unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the preamble to the communique issued by the OECD after its annual
meeting which ended in Paris yesterday.
MINISTERS addressed the need to restore strong, sustained growth with
improved employment prospects; they agreed on collective action to meet the
major challenges facing their countries. They are deeply concerned that
growth in the OEC area is insufficient and that unemployment continues to
rise in most countries. To cope with these problems they are resolved to
take additional action to improve both macroeconomic and structural policies
and to extend international co-operation, in particular by strengthening the
open multilateral trading system.
Ministers are committed to a concerted strategy for growth and employment.
It consists of the following planks. . . .
monetary and fiscal policies willl exploit the opportunities that may exist
 -without jeopardising the objectives of price stability and medium term
budget consolidation;
structural reform policies, including labour market policies, will aim for
vigorous, competitive and efficient development of OECD economies,
exploiting opportunities offered by technological progress and open
international competition;
intensive efforts will be made to continue to liberalise trade, to abide by
and further strengthen multilateral disciplines and, as the first priority,
to achieve a substantial, comprehensive and balanced outcome of the Uruguay
Round by the end of the year - which would be a very powerful contributor to
bolstering confidence, growth and employment both in OECD members and
elsewhere.
In pursuit of this strategy, effective support will be given for the
progressive integration of all countries into the world economy; this will
include the concerted international effort to support the economies in
transition, in particular Russia, and developing countries.
Ministers underline the particular relevance of the OECD and of the basic
values its members hold in common: respect for human rights, pluralist
democracy and the market economy. They appreciate its working methods and
its multi-disciplinary character, as exemplified by the study under way on
employment/unemployment. They call on the organisation to continue to build
on its strengths and on the collective wealth of its member countries'
national and regional economic, social and cultural experiences to further
develop common approaches in order better to meet the challenges of a fast
changing world and to foster worldwide sustainable development.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Klockner plan puts Brussels through mill: Debt write-off
delayed by legal and industry support problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL and legal difficulties are holding up formal European Commission
approval of a 40 per cent debt write-off at Klockner-Werke, the German steel
group.
The Commission has decided in principle to forgive part of the EC's DM175m
(Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner, which has filed for protection from its
creditors. But it wants cast-iron guarantees from the German company that it
will reduce capacity.
Approval by Brussels would allow a debt rescheduling deal to go ahead at
Klockner, involving the write-off of loans worth a total of DM1.4bn. But the
Commission has run up against German rules which prevent creditors imposing
legally binding conditions on such debt rescheduling plans.
The Commission is also in the difficult position of trying to fit its
decision on Klockner into an overall plan to support the whole EC steel
industry.
On the one hand, Brussels has come under attack for granting a reprieve to
the German steel group at a time when the rest of the industry is suffering
from overcapacity.
In particular, publicly-owned Italian or Spanish steel producers - which are
being asked to sacrifice capacity if they want to receive state aid - say
Klockner is getting off lightly.
On the other hand, German steelworkers blame the problems at Klockner and
the collapse last month of Saarstahl, a French-owned steelmaker in the
depressed German Saarland, on the EC's failure to get tough with Italy and
Spain.
Commission officials say an inflexible approach to the Klockner case -
demanding the recovery of the entire DM175m loan - could have provoked
outright bankruptcy.
The Commission would have failed in its duty to recover the Community
taxpayers' loan to the company and another producer could then have bought
the company for a pittance and returned it to full production, free of debt.
By contrast, officials say, the deal now awaiting the Commission's
rubber-stamp leaves the German company with a tolerable level of debt, and
is tied to legally-binding, irreversible capacity cuts. Both factors ought
to prevent Klockner from exploiting its narrow escape from bankruptcy and
upsetting the delicately balanced overall steel restructuring plan.
The survival of Klockner may even prompt further rationalisation. Thyssen
and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's largest steel producers, want to take over
Klockner's cold rolling mill in Bremen together with a consortium of
European steelmakers.
The Commission and its potential partners from the private-sector have an
interest in nudging Klockner towards wider-ranging restructuring which might
involve the break-up of the company and possible closure of some hot-rolling
capacity. Hot-rolled products account for 80 per cent of Klockner's
production, but this is the sector where EC overcapacity is at its worst.
Officials say it is 'totally ridiculous' to compare Klockner's debt
write-off with state aid plans by Rome and Madrid. In fact, a rough
comparison between the total debt write-off at Klockner, and the estimated
state aid at Ilva, the Italian steelmaker, indicates that the trade-off
between cash and cuts is similar.
But the Commission is clearly worried that any hint of leniency in the
Klockner or Saarstahl cases could be latched on to by Italy and Spain at a
special meeting of industry ministers next month in an attempt to force EC
approval of their sensitive steel aid-and-restructuring plans.
Indeed, the Commission already seems resigned to losing its DM100m loan to
Saarstahl, rather than allow the Saarland regional government to prop the
company up with subsidies.
'One point is absolutely clear,' says one Brussels official. 'The Commission
will be extremely reluctant to envisage any sort of public aid in this
case.'

FT  04 JUN 93 / Sharp drop in west German GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany's gross domestic product fell by a real 3.2 per cent in the
first quarter of the year, compared with the same period of 1992. It was the
sharpest drop in economic activity since 1975.
The figure was immediately seized upon by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics
minister, as confirmation that Germany could be facing its most severe
recession for more than 30 years.
He warned that the downturn could jeopardise recovery in eastern Germany,
which is heavily dependent on western investment. He called for urgent
measures to control inflation and limit public spending, to provide room for
further cuts in interest rates to stimulate a recovery.
Yet the Bundesbank, whose governing council yesterday decided against any
further rate reductions, cautioned against excessive pessimism about the
figures.
Mr Otmar Issing, a leading director of the bank, said the figure was
distorted by special factors. Economic activity in the first quarter of 1992
was exceptionally favourable, thanks to a particularly mild winter; and
there was a surge in consumer spending in the last quarter of the year,
before a one percentage point increase in value added tax on January 1.
A second set of figures just released, for manufacturing activity in April,
showed a better than expected recovery of 0.5 per cent compared with March.
The March figure was also adjusted upwards, and the two-month total showed
an increase of 1 per cent against January-February.
All categories of economic activity in the GDP were down in the first
quarter, however, with the sharpest fall (14.8 per cent year-on-year)
recorded for investment in plant and equipment. Private consumption was down
1 per cent, state consumption down 1.4 per cent, while imports and exports
both showed sharp declines: 5.4 and 6.3 per cent respectively.
Gross national product, which includes external trade, showed an even
sharper decline than GDP, down by a real 3.7 per cent over the year.
Mr Rexrodt said the figures confirmed his repeated view that 'the current
recession in western Germany could prove more serious than those in the
1960s, the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s'. He said there was 'still
no concrete sign of a turn in the economy'.
His gloom contrasted with the more relaxed attitude of Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, in Bonn on Wednesday, when he warned
against a 'mood of black despair', and insisted that the slump in industrial
production was no more dramatic than in the past recessions of 1973-75 and
1980-82.
On the other hand, the German trade union federation called for an emergency
DM30bn (Pounds 12bn) economic growth initiative to counter rising
unemployment, and for the Bundesbank to take immediate action to 'loosen its
interest-rate stranglehold' on the entire European economy.

FT  04 JUN 93 / US urges plan to prise open Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will next week present Japan with a proposed framework for opening
sectors of the Japanese economy to foreign exporters, Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, said in Paris yesterday.
The US proposal will include a call for Japan to halve its current account
surplus, from the present level of 3 per cent of gross national product to
1.5 per cent.
The framework, intended to replace the Structural Impediments Initiative of
1989, will embrace sectors such as computers and supercomputers, cars and
car parts, and financial services.
'In vital areas, Japan's economy is not open,' Mr Kantor said during
ministerial talks of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
'It will be difficult to have substantial global growth, and to recover from
recession among developed countries, unless something is done about this
imbalance in trade,' Mr Kantor added.
Japanese officials said 'managed trade' proposals would be rejected. In a
six-point memo to the US, setting out the principles that would underly
talks on the framework, they also said numerical targets, such as those
suggested for cutting the current account surplus, were unacceptable.
Japanese negotiators have said discussions on the framework could only occur
if the US agreed not to threaten unilateral sanctions, but to settle any
disagreements in international forums such as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade or the OECD.
'Japanese representatives understand their responsibility in trying to
provide leadership along with the US and the EC in promoting growth. In this
context, they understand the importance of addressing the (trade imbalance)
issue,' Mr Kantor said.
Earlier, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, went further: 'Japan has
both the means and the need to increase domestic demand and reduce its
external surplus. The recent fiscal stimulus package is a useful step, but
it needs to be sustained.'
A senior Japanese trade official said in Paris: 'If the US sets aside the
threat of using Section 301, and really wants to find a solution
bilaterally, then we have no reason to reject it.'
He said the idea of setting specific targets - like those setunder the
US-Japan Semiconduc-tor agreement for foreign companies to win a 20 per cent
share of the Japanese market - was not acceptable 'because it is not the
Japanese government that conducts import business'.
Mr Kantor also said the US 'was not pleased' with the EC decision to
counter-retaliate in their dispute over access to the EC's
telecommunications market.
The EC foreign affairs council is expected next Tuesday to impose sanctions
estimated to be worth about Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.7m) a year against US
companies bidding for public supply contracts of less than Ecu125,000
(Pounds 98,750), and public service contracts worth less than Ecu200,000.
Larger contracts in dredging, transport, legal services, hotels and
restaurants, security services, health and telecommunications, will also be
closed to US bidders. The list virtually mirrors US sanctions imposed after
negotiators failed to agree on liberalisation of the EC's procurement
market.
These are estimated to shut EC bidders out of contracts worth about Dollars
19m a year.
Both sides appear to have reacted mildly in the dispute to prevent it from
jeopardising progress in Uruguay Round negotiations on global trade
liberalisation.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Invesco MIM fined Pounds 750,000: Fund manager admits to 55
charges, including three over Mirror Group assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, has admitted 55 charges of breaching
City rules and is paying a record fine of Pounds 750,000 plus Pounds 1.6m in
costs associated with the disciplinary action.
The charges, which were brought by Imro, the self-regulating organisation
which polices the fund management industry, severely criticise Invesco's
internal controls and its compliance procedures up to December 1992.
However, Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, which is the City's
senior regulator, agree that the fund management group has taken steps to
change its management and compliance procedures which should prevent
repetition of such rule breaches.
The charges are a litany of misconduct by Invesco. They say it breached
rules on the handling of client money, issued a misleading advertisement,
supplied unsatisfactory regulatory information to Imro, carried out business
outside of permitted areas, kept defective records, failed to provide
investors with accurate and timely information and made unsuitable
investments on behalf of customers.
Three of the charges relate to the conduct of one of the group's companies,
Invesco MIM Management, concerning assets belonging to the Mirror Group
Pension Scheme, which was plundered by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. They say
the company failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns about the
way in which the pension fund assets under its management were being used.
They also say the company failed to disclose to the pension fund trustees on
periodic statements that it no longer had custody of investments it was
managing on their behalf.
The SIB said yesterday: 'We are very interested in seeking proper redress
for Maxwell pension funds.'
The Imro judgment may help SIB's campaign to persuade Invesco and other
firms to make contributions to the Maxwell Pensions Unit, which has been set
up to raise funds for pensioners of Mr Maxwell's companies. SIB is keeping
in reserve its powers under the Financial Services Act to force restitution
to Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Charles Brady, executive chairman of Invesco, said: 'Invesco has
participated fully and openly in this investigation. But this is a historic
overhang. My message to shareholders is watch us now.'
He said Invesco had restructured with three separate boards who would be
more accountable to 'local clients and regulators'. He disclosed that 22
senior executives had left the group and up to 30 more at junior levels.
Those who have gone in the last few months include several board members and
the former chairman, Lord Stevens, who stopped working at Invesco last
September but who will be paid until September, receiving more than Pounds
200,000 this financial year. Lord Stevens is chairman of United Newspapers,
owner of Express Newspapers.
Mr Brady said he had also held 'very serious conversations' with Invesco's
auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Any professional adviser I find has been
deficient will be removed,' he said.
The Imro judgment, which imposed the maximum fines available under Imro's
'summary' process, was delivered on May 28 by a three-person disciplinary
committee drawn from its board, and based on a two-year investigation.
Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, said: 'This is a good day for
regulation. It is quite an indictment.'
But, he said, he 'acknowledged the work the management has done'.
Invesco has made a Pounds 4.5m provision in its accounts to cover the costs
of the investigation and restructuring as a result. In addition to the fines
and costs, it said its own legal bills are about Pounds 250,000.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Ford and Rover launch refund offers on new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD and Rover are to offer new car buyers unhappy with their purchases the
chance to exchange their vehicles or receive cash refunds in competing
schemes that break new ground in the European car market.
The two car producers rushed to outflank each other yesterday with rival
announcements claiming to be the first in the market-place with the
initiatives.
Cash refund schemes to dissatisfied car buyers have been pioneered in recent
months in the US, including by Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, but Ford and
Rover both say their UK initiatives are the first to be mounted in Europe.
Rover is to offer retail customers in the UK a new vehicle or a cash refund
within 30 days or 1,000 miles, if they are not satisfied with their first
purchase.
Ford is introducing a 'no strings' offer to both retail and fleet customers
to exchange any new car or commercial vehicle within 30 days or 1,000 miles,
if the customer is dissatisfied. Unlike Rover, Ford is not offering a cash
refund within 30 days.
Ford is offering, however, to replace a car or commercial vehicle or provide
a refund within the first 12 months, if the vehicle has a 'persistent
defect'. After six months, the size of the refund would be reduced to
reflect the mileage driven.
The Rover scheme was originally intended to be unveiled on June 15, but
details were hurriedly announced last night in the wake of a Ford press
conference held at only a couple of hours' notice yesterday afternoon.
The Rover scheme is not open to fleet customers. The offer applies to
customers who have either paid cash for their car or bought it through a
credit arrangement with Rover's finance subsidiary.
The pioneering initiatives from Ford and Rover reflect the growing
importance of sales and marketing and the issue of customer satisfaction as
the new frontier for competition between carmakers, which increasingly have
managed to close the gap between each other in manufacturing efficiency and
quality.
Rover said it had no fears that the scheme would be abused by drivers
looking for free car hire.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Setback for Major as poll rating slumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SLUMP in Mr John Major's popularity to the lowest recorded by any prime
minister since the second world war delivered another blow last night to his
embattled government.
A Gallup opinion poll, which showed support for the government sliding to 25
per cent and for Mr Major personally to just 21 per cent, underlined the
threat of a Conservative defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election.
It compares with the lowest satisfaction rating of 23 per cent recorded by
the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in spring 1990. Six months later she was
toppled as party leader.
The findings by Gallup, which began polling in 1938, coincided with a fresh
outbreak of recriminations in the Conservative party over Mr Major's
decision to sack Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor in last week's cabinet
reshuffle.
With friends of the former chancellor suggesting he is still 'stunned' by
his dismissal, some Tory Euro-sceptics are urging him to pin on Mr Major the
blame for sterling's ignominious exit from the exchange rate mechanism.
The Gallup survey, published in today's issue of The Daily Telegraph, shows
that only 21 per cent of the electorate is satisfied with Mr Major's
performance.
The poll indicates that the Conservatives can now claim the support of only
25 per cent of voters, down from 30 last month. The government's support is
fractionally above the 23 per cent backing for the Liberal Democrats (up
from 17.5 per cent last month).
Labour's support rose to 49 per cent, up from the previous figure of 47 per
cent - giving the opposition a 24-point lead, the second-highest yet
recorded by Gallup. Most of the fieldwork for the poll was conducted after
the reshuffle. Mr Major is expected to use his speech today to the annual
conference of Conservative women to appeal for party unity after the turmoil
since the defeats last month in the Newbury by-election and the county
council elections.
There were suggestions that he would include a suitable tribute to Mr Lamont
in the hope of damping the former chancellor's appetite for revenge. But the
growing disarray in the Conservative party was underlined by a renewed
attack on Mr Major's style of government by Mr Edward Leigh, a right-wing
Tory sacked as a junior minister last week. The depths of the government's
unpopularity has also been brought home personally to ministers and Tory MPs
by visits during this week's Whitsun recess to their constituencies.
Mr Major also faces the prospect next week of a new onslaught on the
Maastricht treaty by Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit. The bill moves to the
House of Lords on Monday and Lady Thatcher may use the debate for a more
general attack on her successor's policies.
Conservative support in Scotland remains at 16 per cent, according to a
System Three poll for The Herald newspaper in Glasgow. The figure is their
lowest rating since March 1986.

NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS, an Ottawa-based data system equipment maker, posted
record sales and profit for the year ended April 30. It attributed the rise
mainly to large orders from international telephone companies, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Sales jumped 70 per cent to CDollars 307m (USDollars 241.7m), while profit
advanced to CDollars 60m, or CDollars 1.63 a share, well ahead of the
CDollars 9.7m, or 28 cents a share, reported a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter profit rose to CDollars 25.5m, or 65 cents, compared with
CDollars 4.7m, or 13 cents, a year earlier, on revenue of CDollars 100m,
against CDollars 52m.
Eight-year-old Newbridge, which specialises in multiplexers for data and
computer networks, said its order book had risen steadily over eight
consecutive quarters.

against CDollars 52m.
Eight-year-old Newbridge, founded by chairman Terry Matthews to specialise
in multiplexers for data and computer networks, said its order book had
risen steadily over eight consecutive quarters.
Newbridge shares recently hit a new high of CDollars 90.75, up from a
52-week low of CDollars 17 7/8 .
Laurentian Bank of Canada, the fastest-growing unit in the Laurentian
financial services group, saw higher provisions reduce second-quarter net
profit, to CDollars 8.3m, or 38 cents a share, from CDollars 9m, or 47
cents, a year earlier.
An acquisition pushed assets up 17 per cent to CDollars 9.7bn since October
31 1992. The Montreal-based bank is still seeking to expand its 237-branch
network in Quebec and Ontario.
Univar, Canada's second biggest food distributor, says first-quarter sales
rose 3.6 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn, mainly because of a 1992 acquisition in
Quebec.
Margins, however, continued to be tight and net profit slipped to CDollars
3.5m, or 2 cents a share, against CDollars 4.9m, or 5 cents, a year earlier.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lihir stake offer brings
confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION REIGNED yesterday over the controversial Lihir Island gold deposit
in Papua New Guinea, the largest undeveloped deposit of its kind in the
world, after the Malaysian Mining Corporation said it had been invited by
the PNG government to take a 20 per cent stake in the USDollars 700m (Pounds
451m) venture.
However, RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, which owns 80
per cent of the project, greeted the news frostily and suggested that MMC
was only one of several corporations that might be interested in a stake in
Lihir.
Some analysts said MMC's statement was probably connected with the political
pressure being applied by the PNG government, which has been demanding that
RTZ go ahead with the project as quickly as possible.
Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's mining minister, is in London today for further
discussions with RTZ. An RTZ official pointed out that the Lihir joint
venture company announced only last week that substantial progress had been
made in talks with the PNG government and that only a few outstanding issues
remained to be resolved. 'We would not be having discussions with the
government unless progress was being made,' the official said.
RTZ, which has indicated that it wants to reduce its shareholding in Lihir
below the 56 per cent it will be left with after the PNG government acquires
30 per cent, said it was talking directly to other interested parties.
The junior partner in the joint venture is Niugini Mining, which discovered
Lihir. It will have 14 per cent after the government takes a stake.
Niugini's parent, Battle Mountain Gold of the US, does not want Niugini to
buy the 20 per cent RTZ is offering.
The PNG government gave RTZ until May 20 to find another partner and said it
would temporarily take 50 per cent of the project in order to to speed up
the funding process.
One analyst pointed out: 'Obviously RTZ would prefer to find its own partner
rather than have the PNG government do it.'
Lihir, in the crater of a dead volcano nearly full of very hot water, has
resources of 42m troy ounces of gold and is expected to produce 628,000
ounces annually in its first 13 years.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (9): A force to be reckoned with / Profile
of Hyundai Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYUNDAI MOTORS is one of the success stories of Korean industry. Its name is
one of the very few Korean brands known to western consumers. It makes more
than half the cars on Korean roads. It is perhaps the only Korean car maker
capable of holding its own in world markets.
But Hyundai's success is, like so much else in the Korean economy, the
product of government planning. Japanese cars are banned entirely from the
Korean market and other foreign cars carry prohibitive tariffs. In 1981, the
government decreed that passenger cars should be made by only two companies,
Hyundai and Daewoo. Given those two factors and a tenfold increase in Korean
car ownership in the past decade, it would have been hard for Hyundai to
fail.
The going is getting tougher. According to Mr Don Lee, motors analyst at BZW
in Seoul, growth in the Korean car market this year could be a mere 11 per
cent, after an average 40 per cent in the previous five years. And the
government has relaxed restrictions on other Korean companies entering the
market. The total is now seven, a number which in the long run is plainly
insupportable. Most worrying for Hyundai is the fact that Samsung, perhaps
the most formidable of all the big Korean conglomerates, may also soon be
allowed to make cars.
But Hyundai is a force to be reckoned with. Like all the other Korean car
makers, it has historically depended on Japanese technology. But this is
changing. Uniquely among Korean manufacturers, Hyundai has reached the stage
of making its own engines.
According to Mr Lee Chung-Goo, vice-president and chief engineer of Hyundai
Motor, Hyundai is technologically self-sufficient, except for engines and
transmissions made under licence from Mitsubishi. But its new family of
engines, the Alpha range, has already been introduced into one model, the
Scoupe. The target is to put Alpha engines into the rest of the range by
1995.
Nevertheless, Hyundai is some way off matching Japanese standards. In the US
market, its cars are a byword for poor quality, chiefly because of
disruptive union disputes at its Korean plant in the late 1980s.
'I'm not satisfied with our efficiency', Mr Lee says. 'Our union problems
started from 1986 and our workmanship is still not as good as it was before
then. Previously, the workforce had a hungry spirit. Now they think they can
get by, so they're not so accurate as they were in assembly work. Rejects
are still much worse than in 1986.'
Meanwhile, he says, the Japanese have not been standing still. 'On hardware
and the lines themselves, we have invested in higher productivity, and our
latest plant is very close to Japanese levels. But though our average
quality standards are not so far from the Japanese, the tolerance is too
big. So customers complain. We need a campaign in the plant to improve
that.'
Another crucial advantage enjoyed by Japanese carmakers is their domestic
supply of components. This is not merely a matter of quality and innovation.
Component supply is central to the Japanese system of lean manufacture
whereby inventories are squeezed out of the system and costs held down.
'We have many disadvantages when it comes to sub-contractors', Mr Lee says.
'According to Japanese studies, even if a manufacturer like Hyundai could
catch up with the Japanese, their sub-contractors are 10 or 20 years behind.
The big developments of the future will be in electronic components. Japan
has suppliers like Nippondentsu and Hitachi - big companies which can
support the R&amp;D. In Korea there are almost none. In things like navigation
systems, the Japanese sub-contractors are ahead of the manufacturers. No
Korean company is even thinking in those terms.'
At present, Mr Lee claims, only 2 per cent of the value of Hyundai cars is
imported. 'But I'm worried about the future. Most Korean suppliers are close
to Japanese standards in hardware terms, but not in terms of human
resources. Their organisation and systems may appear close to Japanese
standards, but they are behind in management terms, especially when it comes
to quality levels.'
Despite the problems, Hyundai has ruled out the idea of manufacturing
abroad. Its plant at Ulsan, on Korea's south-east coast, is the biggest
single vehicle manufacturing complex in the world. The area - some 4.8m
square metres - is now fully occupied. In three years, Mr Lee says, more
capacity will be needed. Within the next month or so, the decision will be
made on where to put it.
It will certainly be in Korea. There are several reasons for this. The
Korean market is of paramount importance, as are - for better or worse  -
the existing links with suppliers. And a new plant will be for a new model,
which as a matter of principle will be tried first on the Korean market.
And, says Mr Lee, there is a cultural reason. 'The Koreans are hot and
emotional people, as opposed to the Japanese who are cold and analytical.
That can lead to management problems in working overseas.'
Hyundai's one experience of overseas manufacture has been traumatic. In 1983
it set up an assembly plant at Bromont in Canada. As a way into the US
market, it proved wildly premature. According to outside estimates, the
plant is now working at only 30 per cent of capacity.
'The Bromont story hasn't been happy', Mr Lee says. 'We're presently
investing in China, Thailand and Egypt. But these will probably be joint
ventures where we supply parts only. In Europe and America, it will take a
long time. China has cheap labour and market growth. In Europe, labour costs
are higher,and the management needs to be different in philosophical terms
from the Oriental model.'
All the while, there is the recurring threat of excess competition in the
Korean market. 'In my personal opinion', says Mr Lee, 'while Japan has
reconstructed its industry through quasi-mergers, Korea is going the
opposite way. That's very dangerous. I don't think mergers will be possible.
All the manufacturers are from strong groups, and the owners all have strong
characters. And while in the past the government could force mergers, with
democracy that's harder than before.'
There is another, more radical threat. Cars are one of about 30 items
covered by the Korean government's so-called Import Diversification Policy,
which is a polite term for banning Japanese goods from the Korean market.
This is officially justified by reference to Korea's chronic trade imbalance
with Japan. In reality, it has more to do with the deep-seated fear that in
free market conditions Japan, the old colonial power, would re-establish its
dominance by economic means.
The government's economic advisers argue that this is incompatible with
Korea's membership of the international free trade system, and that the
barriers will have to be dismantled within the next few years. How
politically realistic this is remains to be seen. But, as Mr Don Lee of BZW
says: 'in terms of technology and global competitiveness this is a very
important time. The Korean car companies have to develop their own
technology and improve their overseas marketing in the next couple of years
if they're to compete globally. Hyundai is going that way. As for the other
companies, I'm very concerned.'

<TEXT>
DENTSU, Japan's largest advertising agency, yesterday unveiled a sharp fall
in profits. It blamed the decline on reduced spending on advertising by its
clients, who were hit by the country's economic downturn.
Advertising spending last year declined for the first time since 1965.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March plunged
53.9 per cent to Y15.7bn (Dollars 142.72m) against last year's results. It
was Dentsu's second consecutive year of falling profits.
Operating revenues fell 9.4 per cent to Y1,165.8bn, the first fall since
1966. Net profits plummeted 59.8 per cent to Y6.2bn.
Dentsu, which is unlisted, said newspaper advertising dropped 14.5 per cent,
as sectors of the economy which rely on newspaper advertisments - property,
finance, automotive, and consumer electronics - were hit by the bursting of
the 1980s economic bubble.
Revenue from television advertising, which accounts for about 45 per cent of
Dentsu's total, fell 5.7 per cent. Industries which use television
advertising, including cosmetics and foods, were generally unscathed by the
recession.
Dentsu's sales in the Tokyo area, which account for nearly 70 per cent of
its total, declined 11.1 per cent.
For the year ending next March 31, Dentsu forecasts a 3 per cent increase in
turnover, to Y1,200bn.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anglo American promotes its
variety show / Examining the South African group's optimistic approach to
diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to the pundits, Anglo American, South Africa's largest company,
should be on the defensive.
Three weeks ago Gencor, its rival and the country's next largest mining
house, announced amid much applause it would 'unbundle'. Anglo, meanwhile,
was criticised for its cautious response and commentators agreed that, more
than ever, its raison d'etre in its current shape, should be called into
question.
However, judging by Anglo's results presentation on Tuesday - held in its
smart new office building at 55 Marshall Street, next door to its
headquarters in Johannesburg's business district - the company's mood is
optimistic.
The group was robust about the benefits of diversity - its thinly disguised
code for saying it does not agree with unbundling - and Mr Julian Ogilvie
Thompson, chairman, was bullish about prospects saying: 'We're a dynamic
group with lots of exciting developments before us.'
It is notable that many analysts are happy now to go along with Mr Ogilvie
Thompson's judgments. Mr Dave Russell, mining analyst at Irish &amp; Menell
Rosenberg, the South African stockbroking firm, said: 'I came away feeling
this is a sound company. They have top quality assets, top quality people
and they're doing the right thing by diversifying geographically and
product-wise.'
Analysts not only believe that Anglo is in sound shape with good prospects.
They also applaud what they describe as a very noticeable trend towards more
open communications with the investment community.
Considering the torrent of invective that descended on Anglo last August
when its associate company De Beers reported its half-year results, this is
a remarkable shift in sentiment. It is also a considerable victory for those
in the group who have favoured a more open approach.
After the De Beers debacle, when the diamond company announced an unexpected
reversal of its prospects and forecast a dividend cut, there was no shortage
of old-timers in the group crowing: 'We told you so.' Now, in the words of
one insider: 'That debate is pretty well resolved. If we're not yet at the
level of enthusiasm, we're at least committed to (openness).'
Nevertheless, this week's results announcement was clear evidence that Anglo
has much to learn in presentation. Although full of information, it remained
wooden in delivery and too long. Ironically, the outstanding exception was
Mr Graham Boustred, the group's industrial doyen, who discarded prepared
scripts to speak with humour and expertise about a wide range of industrial
projects.
Though the word 'unbundling' was not used in nearly 100 minutes, the entire
presentation was structured around a rebuttal of the concept. Or, to state
it positively as Anglo did, in defence of the merits of diversity - both in
terms of business and geography.
According to Mr Ogilvie Thompson, diversity underpinned not only Anglo's
results - with attributable profits falling by a less than expected 8 per
cent to R1.53bn (Dollars 481m) in the year to March - but also six projects
in which it is involved.
Clearly, Anglo has taken the view that it cannot win the unbundling battle
with words alone. It needs to demonstrate the vitality of its group
structure by undertaking innovative projects, both at home and abroad.
Certainly the six projects at issue - domestically, the Moab extension to
the Vaal Reefs gold mine, the Namakwa heavy mineral sands scheme, and the
Columbus stainless steel project with, internationally, the Mantos Blancos
copper developments in South America, the Del Monte/Royal food group in
Europe and the Zebra high energy battery project in Europe - are an
impressive attempt to prove Anglo's case.
Mantos Blancos and Columbus are regarded as gems, Namakwa as good while Moab
depends on the gold price.
Del Monte is clearly a risky diversification for a group that has never been
close to the consumer, but Mr Boustred says he is 'extremely optimistic' and
that is enough recommendation for most, given his considerable reputation.
The Zebra battery scheme, to make high energy batteries that could power
electric cars, is the sort of long term, capital intensive development
project which only those with deep pockets can contemplate - with the
promise of considerable reward.
Insiders say that the optimistic mood in the group is a function of having
all these projects. Spirits have also been improved by the remarkable
resurgence in the share price, off a recent peak of R146, but nearly double
last October's low of R74.50.
This is mostly a function of investors buying Anglo in order to have
exposure to gold, an explanation that suits Anglo well as it again
underlines the case for diversity.
Though Anglo takes comfort from the view of the market, insiders are anxious
to stress they do not reject all the ideas embraced in the unbundling
concept. While they reject the argument that the 'dead hand of the centre'
stifles initiative and efficiency, they claim to be seriously committed to
black economic empowerment.
Also, the group has not set its face against restructuring, and believes
this would be a natural adjunct if South Africa lifts exchange controls.
The big question, though, is to what extent a new government in South Africa
would try to force an unbundling. Here Anglo can only say that it has
repeatedly made clear its view that it would be economic folly to take the
big stick to the country's large groups.
That, however, is tomorrow's issue.

NEW YORK LIFE, the large US life company which moved into the UK insurance
market when it acquired the Windsor Life group in 1989, is buying the life
insurance operations of Aetna UK, part of another big US insurance combine.
The operations which are changing hands comprise a mixture of life, health
and disability income insurance, and take in the second-largest provider of
employee benefits in the UK.
No purchase price for the deal was disclosed, but assets supporting the
operations total about Dollars 400m.
The transaction is dependent on UK regulatory approvals.
Aetna UK is part of Aetna Life and Casualty, the large US composite insurer.
Aetna said it would continue to run its remaining UK operations, which
encompass reinsurance, property-casualty policies and investment management.
The deal is the second acquisition by Windsor Life since it came under New
York Life's control. In 1992, it purchased Gresham Life Assurance.
The latest transaction - which, according to New York Life, 'gives entry to
the very important employee benefits market in Britain' - should take total
assets under management at Windsor to around Dollars 1.5bn.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase at Outokumpu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced profits
before extraordinary items of FM83m (Dollars 15.4m) for the first four
months of 1993, compared with just FM3m a year earlier and heavy losses in
the succeeding eight months.
Sales were ahead by 25 per cent at FM5.5bn (FM4.4bn), while operating income
rose to FM477m from FM288m.
A big factor in the recovery was the steep depreciation late last year of
the Finnish markka. About half of Outokumpu's output is invoiced in markkas
 -including all production from the profitable stainless steel division,
which saw sales increase by almost a third, to FM1.26bn.
The base metals, copper products and technology divisions were reported to
be profitable at the operating level and all showed an increase in sales.
However, although it forecast maintained profitability throughout this year,
after two successive years of losses, Outokumpu said growth in metals demand
and prices remained low.
Outokumpu also said poor market conditions had forced it to postpone the
planned sale of its US chemicals subsidiary, OM Group.
The sale, by a public offering in the US, was planned to raise up to Dollars
170m.
However, the group, 57.5 per cent owned by the Finnish government, is going
ahead with its proposed FM527m rights issue.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Weaker krona helps lift SSAB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAKER Swedish krona, lower taxes on inputs and cost cutting helped SSAB,
the Swedish steel group, increase pre-tax profits in the first four months
of the year by 42 per cent to SKr124m (Dollars 17.2m), in spite of lower
sales.
SSAB, which was privatised last year, said continued weak demand in western
Europe, including recession-hit Sweden, led to a fall in sales in the period
to SKr4.17bn from SKr4.35bn.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, the chief executive, told shareholders at yesterday's
annual meeting that levels of steel consumption in Sweden were 25 per cent
below those of 1989.
SSAB said its rationalisation programme, combined with lower energy taxes
and a cut in Swedish employers' contributions, had led to savings of
SKr400m.
With an annual net inflow of foreign currency of SKr3bn before last year's
devaluation, the company was also benefiting from the fall in value of the
Swedish currency.
It also anticipated further improvement from a 10 per cent increase in steel
prices since April 1, repeating an earlier forecast that the company would
show a profit over the full year, rebounding from a SKr165m pre-tax loss in
1992.
In the first four months, a SKr34m loss in the steel plate division was
offset by a swing in the products division from a SKr19m loss to a SKr17m
profit, and a sharp reduction in losses in the Tibnor trading unit from a
deficit of SKr53m to a deficit of SKr7m.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SW Wood ahead and pays Pounds 2.5m for A
Gait
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SW WOOD, the specialist printing and packaging business previously involved
in metal trading, is acquiring Albert Gait Holdings and its subsidiaries for
an initial Pounds 2.51m.
The acquisition is part of Wood's policy of expansion in the printing and
packaging industry.
The initial Pounds 2.51m payment is to be satisfied by the issue of 2.39m
ordinary shares worth 70p each, making Pounds 1.68m, plus Pounds 837,500 in
cash. These payments rely on Gait achieving pre-tax profits of Pounds
500,000 in the year to June 30 and net assets of Pounds 1.7m.
Further cash consideration to a maximum of Pounds 506,250 will be due if
adjusted profits for the year to June 30 1994 exceed Pounds 335,000.
Grimsby-based Gait is involved in the printing and production of timetables
and handbooks, computerised typesetting, plate making and book and
stationery retailing.
Wood yesterday also announced sharply higher profits for the year to March
31. The pre-tax result of Pounds 1.02m compared with a Pounds 250,000
deficit previously (restated in accordance with the FRS 3 accounting
standard).
The directors have recommended payment of a final dividend of 0.75p, which
makes an increased total of 1.25p (0.25p).
Turnover for the 12 months jumped to Pounds 10.6m, including Pounds 909,000
from discontinued operations.
Sales of Pounds 5.24m in 1991-92 included Pounds 2.9m from discontinued
operations.
Shareholders' approval for the acquisition will be sought at an egm on July
2.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Dialling new international numbers / Analysis of the
marriage of BT and MCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT has been dating MCI for nearly three years, so news that they are going
up the aisle does not come out of the blue. Yet the link-up marks a
significant departure in international telecommunications.
A telling tribute came from the new partnership's arch-competitor: American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier. 'We're pro-competition and
there's a good competitor shaping up out there,' said Mr John Foster, AT&amp;T's
European communications services director.
The partnership comprises two inter-related deals: the establishment of a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) joint venture company, 75 per cent owned by BT, to
pioneer global services and pool technical and marketing resources; and the
purchase of 20 per cent of MCI by BT for Dollars 4.3bn, slightly offset by
the acquisition of BT's fledgling North American business for Dollars 125m.
For BT, the joint venture marks a further stage in the privatised UK
carrier's battle with AT&amp;T to become the leading supplier of international
voice and data services to the world's 2,500 multinationals. The stake in
MCI creates a safe - and, it hopes, profitable - haven for a fair part of
BT's growing cash mountain, putting it beyond the grasp of the UK regulator
and shareholders calling for larger dividends.
MCI gains international clout from the alliance - much needed in its own
battle with AT&amp;T. BT's Dollars 4.3bn cash injection also gives it investment
opportunities. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chief executive, refused to say what
they might be, but noted the increased competition in the US local telecoms
market with the expansion of cable services.
How does the City view the alliance? With the last tranche of BT shares
about to reach the market, telecoms analysts suggested yesterday that it was
likely to strengthen the company's appeal to overseas investors, but could
weaken it at home.
BT is not getting its chunk of MCI cheap. In the past 18 months MCI's share
price has risen from Dollars 30 to Dollars 52, and BT is offering Dollars
64. 'There is a feeling that the stake is nothing more than a massive
portfolio investment,' said one City analyst. 'MCI's share performance since
early 1992 is incredible. BT could be paying over the odds; on the other
hand, it can't any longer be accused of lacking an international strategy.'
Much depends upon the viability of BT's global strategy. Targetting the
'outsourcing' needs of multinationals is the fashion of the day, and could
yield large dividends as demand for high-technology international
value-added services grows. However, the number of multinationals is small
and servicing them can only be one part of an international strategy.
Furthermore, BT's investment record in North America is not unblemished.
Last year it sold its stake in Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications
manufacturer, at a loss; it has made little money out of McCaw, the US
mobile phone group, which it is about to sell to AT&amp;T; and Syncordia, its
US-based global outsourcing subsidiary, has still to make an impact. Mr Iain
Vallance, BT chairman, brushed such qualms aside yesterday, pointing to
MCI's proven record in capturing market share in the US.
The BT alliance is a staging post in MCI's remarkable ascent. Starting life
in the 1960s as Microwave Communications (filing licences to build a network
of microwave towers which connected 17 US cities), in the 1980s it became
David taking on the AT&amp;T Goliath.
Led by the late Mr Bill McGowan, the upstart turned to the courts, using
legal manoeuvres to pry away at the AT&amp;T monopoly. Its opportunity came in
1984 - coincidentally the year of BT's privatisation - when 'Ma Bell' was
broken up, leaving AT&amp;T to run the long distance phone service and the seven
'Baby Bells' to handle local phone services.
MCI quickly seized around 10 per cent of the long distance market. The going
was tough. At the beginning of the decade, AT&amp;T regained part of its lost
market share, and in 1990 MCI's shares plunged from a peak of Dollars 45 to
Dollars 18.5. But MCI retaliated with a highly successful 'Friends and
Family' campaign, offering 20 per cent discounts to groups of customers
calling each other frequently, and regained its edge.
The alliance comes a week after AT&amp;T launched Worldsource, its strongest bid
yet for global telecoms leadership. Although their goals are the same, AT&amp;T
and BT/MCI are adopting different approaches. The BT/MCI venture is an
exclusive club: 'We are not seeking a European partner for this deal at the
moment,' said Mr Vallance. By contrast, AT&amp;T is working through
non-exclusive partnerships, and is anxiously seeking a European partner for
its Worldsource launch on the continent next year.
Many of the details of the BT/MCI joint venture - including its name - have
still to be agreed. MCI will hold a 24.9 per cent stake and expects to
handle the marketing of the jointly branded products in the Americas and the
Caribbean. BT, the majority partner, will cover Europe and Asia.
Explaining how this might work in practice, Mr Roberts said that a client
like JP Morgan, the US investment bank which recently awarded MCI an Dollars
80m 'global services' contract, would in future be sold services under the
joint venture umbrella. However, the account would still be handled by an
MCI team, with the use of additional 'remote' accounting personnel.
While BT has been courting American partners, Cable and Wireless, BT's UK
competitor, has concentrated its energies on less glamorous ventures,
notably on taking stakes and fulfilling franchise contracts in countries
with under-developed telecoms systems.
It remains to be seen which strategy yields the larger return. But there can
be no doubt, as Mr Vallance put it, that the BT/MCI venture 'sets a new
pattern to global telecommunications'.

FT  03 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: BT's big gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's chairman Mr Iain Vallance - the John Major of the telecoms industry -
has finally crystallised his Big Idea. Global services to multinational
companies are to be the way forward, while partnership with MCI will enable
BT to participate in the US market without diverting attention from the
European home base.
By any measure the stake in MCI is expensive. BT is paying a 20 per cent
premium to what was already an all-time high in MCI's shares. It is hard to
justify paying Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in a company with net
assets of Dollars 3.2bn. A multiple of 25 times likely 1993 earnings looks
pricey when prior to the deal MCI was only expected to grow at 15 per cent
over the next two years. Small wonder, then, that MCI is delighted with the
deal.
It is also a worry that BT's strategic grip has been questionable in the
past and all of its previous international gambits have come to naught.
Significant revenues from the joint venture are some years off, and while
MCI may invest the money to good effect in a rapidly evolving telecoms
market, results are by no means certain. Meanwhile AT&amp;T can be expected to
make BT's life as miserable as possible.
Still, BT can afford such largesse. It is some measure of the strength of
BT's domestic business that these deals would have to go very badly wrong
indeed to have a material impact on the juggernaut's progress. There is just
a chance that if it works the alliance will get BT out of its box in the UK.
The government, which is trying to sell BT3 at a discount to UK
institutions, might wish that it was AT&amp;T that was trying to buy a
substantial stake in BT at a 20 per cent premium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN CORPORATE executives describe their deals as 'nuclear', people should
ask what is the fall-out. Such is the natural response to BT's proposed
Dollars 4.3bn investment in MCI, the US telecommunications group, and the
parallel establishment of a Dollars 1bn joint venture to provide
'state-of-the-art' services to multinational corporations.
UK telephone users will wonder whether the fact that BT can splash out such
large sums of money shows that its monopoly power has allowed it to earn
excess profits since its 1984 privatisation. Shareholders may wonder whether
their interests would not have been better served if the cash had been
handed to them in higher dividends.
BT's chairman, Mr Iain Vallance, argues that customers will benefit from the
range of sophisticated services provided by the new joint venture and that
shareholders will do well, because MCI is a good investment. But neither
argument is all that convincing.
Multinational customers may benefit from the joint venture, but they are a
tiny proportion of BT's customers. Many more could benefit if the deal led
to the sweeping-away of the cartel-like arrangements that govern
international telecommunications and keep transatlantic phone charges more
than twice as high as might apply in a competitive market.
Unfortunately, BT does not plan to use its 20 per cent stake in MCI to upset
the current arrangements, which involve it channelling the majority of its
transatlantic traffic through AT&amp;T, MCI's larger competitor. In some ways,
the deal may even delay competition because BT is retreating from plans to
set up its own US long-distance operator to rival AT&amp;T and MCI.
From the perspective of shareholders, the concern must be that the deal is
another grandiose scheme from a management with a poor track record in
foreign investment. BT has dissipated shareholder wealth or, at best, broken
even from a string of other North American investments - notably, Mitel, the
Canadian telecommunications manufacturer, and McCaw, the mobile
communications group.
One could argue that shareholders should be able to take care of their own
interests. But the snag with the British form of capitalism is that it has
not been very effective at controlling managements where the principal
discipline - threat of takeover - is widely seen as inoperative because of
political considerations. This is doubly so in BT's case, which will
continue to be protected by a 'golden share' even after the government's
sale of its final stake in the company next month.
Government, shareholders and consumers ought to be concerned that wealth
generated by a regulated monopoly whose management is under little external
discipline may be frittered away in unwise foreign adventures. Shareholders,
in particular, should be asking tough questions.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Drink suppliers to open market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's largest carbonated drink suppliers yesterday agreed to give
undertakings aimed at guaranteeing competition in the soft drinks industry,
nearly two years after they were first recommended by a Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report.
Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages, Coca-Cola Bottlers (Ulster), and Britvic  -
which together account for more than half the UK's Pounds 5.5bn carbonated
drinks market - agreed to end exclusive or restrictive supply agreements
with pubs and leisure outlets.
Coca-Cola Schweppes also agreed to seek approval from the Office of Fair
Trading before it acquired any business involved in supplying draught soft
drinks through dispensing machines.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, asked for the undertakings
last June. His request followed consultation between the Department of Trade
and Industry and the companies, after a commission report on the carbonated
drinks market published in August 1991.
The report found competition was generally effective in the take-home trade,
but that practices in the leisure trade could restrict choice and lead to
higher prices.
Mr Hamilton called the undertakings a 'very satisfactory outcome'.
Coca-Cola Schweppes, a joint venture between the US Coca-Cola Company and
Cadbury Schweppes of the UK, which has 30 per cent of the carbonated drinks
market, said the undertakings would have 'no significant impact' on its
business as they affected only about 1 per cent of its sales volume.
Britvic, owned by brewers including Bass, Whitbread and Allied Lyons, which
has about 20 per cent of the UK market, said the undertakings would have 'no
effect on its ongoing business'.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Planned increase in terror premiums condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL insurance buyers yesterday condemned swingeing increases in
premiums for terrorism insurance planned by Pool Re, the government-backed
reinsurance company.
The government announced last Friday that it would press Pool Re to increase
rates for policies starting after July 1, following the IRA bombing of
Bishopsgate in the City in April.
According to a letter sent to one leading UK company by the Department of
Trade and Industry, large London-based businesses will face increases of
more than 300 per cent.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce,
which represents commercial insurance buyers at more than 300 UK companies,
says moves to penalise city-centre businesses, particularly those in London,
is 'short sighted and could prove counter-productive'. The association said
it would prefer 'the traditional and proven insurance involving the
spreading of risk. It is more equitable.'
The Confederation of British Industry also renewed warnings to the
government about the potential impact on business of raising terrorism
insurance premiums on City and West End properties by up to 300 per cent.
The DTI letter said: 'The most significant change is the removal of the
discounts which had previously been given for large sums insured. We
concluded that while this may be an appropriate approach for fire insurance,
it is unsuitable for terrorism insurance.'
An 'extra large' property based in central London and valued at Pounds 500m
would pay Pounds 720,000 for its terrorism insurance after the revision
compared with between Pounds 175,000 and Pounds 262,500 before. A 'very
large' central London property worth Pounds 100m would pay Pounds 144,000

Smaller properties outside central London would benefit from lower rates.

FT  03 JUN 93 / BT takes global step with Dollars 4.3bn US deal: MCI agrees
to joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM and MCI of the US yesterday made a bold bid for leadership
of the international telecommunications industry. BT is to take a Dollars
4.3bn (Pounds 2.8bn) stake in MCI, the second largest US carrier, and set up
a Dollars 1bn joint venture with it in a development that could reduce
significantly the cost of trans- atlantic calls.
BT will take 20 per cent of MCI and put up three-quarters of the capital for
the joint venture, which is designed to exploit the fast-growing market
among multinational companies for international voice and data transmission
services.
The moves will not delay the sale of the UK government's remaining tranche
of BT shares, the prospectus for which will be issued at the end of this
month as previously planned.
Coming a week after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier,
launched its Worldsource venture to exploit the global market, the new
alliance will intensify the battle between AT&amp;T and BT and MCI for
international custom.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said the investment and joint venture lay
at the centre of the company's strategy 'to become a leading global provider
to multinationals'.
Under the deal, BT will put up Dollars 830m immediately; the balance will
come from cash and borrowings, offset by the Dollars 1.8bn BT expects to
receive in this financial year from the sale to AT&amp;T of McCaw, its US
cellular telephone subsidiary. BT will gain three directors on the MCI
board; the chairman of MCI, Mr Bert Roberts, will join the BT board.
BT is paying an average of Dollars 64 a share for its MCI stake, a premium
on the Dollars 52 closing price on Tuesday. As part of the deal, MCI is
taking over most of BT's North American assets.
The joint venture, to be located in either Washington or London, will
eventually subsume Syncordia, BT's US-based global outsourcing operation.
Apart from attracting business, it will undertake research and development
for the two companies, providing a 'global platform' for value added
services such as frame relay and outsourcing.
Mr Roberts said the alliance was 'indicative of future opportunities' in the
telecommunications industry, and would help MCI to continue its growth in
the US domestic market while competing on the world market.
Both companies stressed the link-up would not affect existing relationships
with other international carriers, and made light of potential regulatory
hurdles. US regulations limit foreign ownership of a US carrier to 25 per
cent.
Talks between the two companies, which already have close commercial links,
have been progressing for several years. 'BT thought they could conquer the
US; MCI thought it could conquer the world,' said Mr Roberts, explaining why
an alliance had not materialised earlier.
Last night, Moody's, one of the big US debt rating agencies, said it was
considering downgrading about Dollars 8.7bn of long debt at British Telecom,
in the wake of the MCI deal. However, the agency also said that it would
consider raising MCI's debt rating, given the company's 'potential for an
improved operating profile and increased financial flexibility'.
In New York, BT ADRs closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 , while MCI
shares gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 54 3/8 , a 52-week high. AT&amp;T shares
were unchanged by the close, at Dollars 62, having fallen initially on the
news. In London, the City reacted cautiously to the announcement. The move
was thought to make strategic sense for the UK carrier, but institutional
investors were concerned about the price paid for the MCI stake and likely
returns. BT's shares closed 5p down at 421 1/2p.
BT was advised by N M Rothschild and MCI by Goldman Sachs.

Suspected Unita rebels attacked onshore oil storage tanks at Angola's second
main oil centre, Soyo, the Petrofina oil company confirmed yesterday, Reuter
reports from Luanda. A spokesman for the Belgium-based oil company said two
storage tanks, each with a capacity of 70,000 cubic metres, had been
attacked on Tuesday. He estimated the damage at Dollars 15m and said around
400,000 barrels of oil may have been lost.
He said it was not clear who had carried out the attack on the
installations, some 15 miles south of Soyo, but added that it bore the
hallmark of Unita rebels who recaptured the north-western town recently.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Tunisian torture claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of women have been detained, harassed and intimidated in Tunisia in
the past two years, says a report published today by the London-based human
rights organisation, Amnesty International, writes Francis Ghiles.
The report also says that 'scores (of women) were tortured, ill-treated,
beaten and sexually abused and threatened with rape in the ministry of the
interior and police stations where torture and ill-treatment of men
detainees had become routine.'
Initially, women were targeted by the Tunisian security forces because they
were relatives of the now-banned Al Nahda (Renaissance) movement. However,
the report adds that 'since the middle of 1992, women activists and the
wives of activists of the Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens have been
subjected to the same pattern of human rights violations.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE annual conference of the International Labour Organisation opened in
Geneva yesterday against a gloomy backdrop of rising unemployment, poverty
and discrimination.
On the agenda of the three-week conference are reports documenting a record
113 alleged violations of trade union rights and freedoms, as well as
growing job discrimination based on race, nationality and religion.
The main theme of the conference this year is the need to improve social
welfare systems in both rich and poor countries. The 2,000 or so delegates
will also discuss new international rules for preventing big industrial
accidents and protecting part-time workers.
The report on breaches of the ILO's freedom of association convention, which
upholds trade union rights, singles out El Salvador for severe violence
against trade unionists, including murder, kidnapping, disappearance,
physical assaults and death threats. The ILO also calls on the Salvadorean
government to release jailed trade unionists.
The Ivory Coast is criticised for interference with trade union activities,
including arrests and dismissals of trade union members.
Britain has come under fire for the ninth time since 1979. The latest
complaint relates to trade unionists dismissed or unable to find a job
because they were on a recruitment blacklist compiled by the Economic
League, an employer-funded organisation.
The 163-nation ILO, whose aims include the eradication of poverty and
unemployment, is organised on a tripartite basis, with governments,
employers and trade unions all represented. The conference costs the ILO
about Dollars 6m, against a total annual budget of around Dollars 280m.
Governments pay the travel and hotel costs of their employer and trade union
representatives.

Georgia, in the throes of civil war, has become the latest former Soviet
republic to announce plans to abandon the rouble as its currency, writes
Leyla Boulton. Mr Tengiz Sigua, the Georgian prime minister, was quoted
yesterday by Interfax news agency as saying the rouble would be replaced by
coupons issued in April to pay wages, pensions and student grants after
Russia cut off deliveries of banknotes. He did not say when this would
occur.
Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin yesterday threatened to impose economic
sanctions on impoverished former Soviet republics which did not repay their
debts to it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRAFT legislation to increase competition in EC postal services could be
ready this autumn if ministers agree to push ahead with liberalisation. The
European Commission said yesterday it hoped ministers would press for formal
proposals on June 16, with a view to agreeing legislation as early as next
summer.
But Commission 'guidelines' on the next moves, published yesterday, indicate
several difficult problems. In particular, months of talks with consumers,
postal administrations, governments and unions have failed to produce a
detailed definition of the areas which should remain under the control of
national postal monopolies.
In a discussion document last year the Commission said it favoured opening
express services and the mailing of publications to greater competition, and
liberalising direct mail and cross-border postal services. It indicated it
might allow national monopolies to retain control over domestic personal and
business correspondence, but industry and consumers have yet to agree on the
precise weight and price of mail which would fall into this reserved area.
The Commission said yesterday it wanted to set an acceptable overall
definition of the so-called 'universal service' and reserved areas, rather
than build liberalisation of the sector on the shaky foundation of a series
of court rulings.
Mr Geoffrey Cruikshanks of the Association of European Express Carriers said
yesterday that the Commission should allow competition in the market to
improve the quality of services, rather than trying to influence performance
with legislation.
The Commission said there appeared to be general agreement on the need for
EC action in separating regulation and operation of postal services,
defining universal services, setting common criteria for access to the
market and quality of service, and setting technical standards.

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial buying, believed to be from the US, drove Lasmo shares a further
7 higher at 162p on relatively heavy turnover of 4.4m.
The shares have risen strongly in the past week, up from the mid-140's, as
US investors have bought heavily into the recently-announced convertible
bond issue.
The company is said to be about to embark on a series of presentations to US
institutions, commencing on Monday, ahead of the scheduled ADR (American
Depository Receipts) listing expected in the next few weeks.
BT's move to buy a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the US long-distance phone-line
carrier, so close to the forthcoming flotation of the Government's remaining
stake in BT, saw the UK group's shares decline 5 to 421 1/2 p on hefty
turnover of 7.9m shares as the market fretted about the possibility that the
move could prove earnings dilutive in the short term. However, analysts
adopted a more positive tone after the post-news meeting with BT/MCI.
'It's an exciting new strategic development for BT and looks like being
earnings enhancing next year,' said Mr Christopher Tucker,' telecoms
specialist at Carr Kitcat and Aitken. the stockbroker.
BT is paying Dollars 830m for a 4.9 per cent stake in MCI with the rest
payable in due course. The two telecoms giants are setting up a joint
Dollars 1bn venture in telecoms circuitry.
Vodafone jumped 16 to 443p on further reflection of last month's new
connections numbers and ahead of next week's preliminary results. which are
expected to show profits up to around Pounds 270m, compared with last year's
Pounds 244m.
The sharp rise in the dollar drove insurance brokers higher with Willis
Corroon 8 better at 204p and Sedgwick 3 to the good at 168p. 'Sedgwick has
been unfairly left behind by Willis,' said an analyst.
The absence of a widely hinted rights issue from engineering group Siebe,
together with final figures at the top end of market forecasts sent the
shares 17 ahead to 477p.
International mining group RTZ added 7 to 674p, after two brokers
recommended the stock. Mr Matthew Sutherland at NatWest Securities said the
current year will continue to be difficult but, 'in 1994, global economic
recovery is forecast to be strong enough to cause recovery in metal prices.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street's decline as the London market was closing yesterday, sparked
off a flurry of selling in a high-profile drugs sector still susceptible to
bouts of concern that the US administration could launch an attack profit
margins in the US pharmaceuticals industry.
One leading UK investment bank was a significant seller of Glaxo put
options, driving down the underlying stock price, which ended the session 14
weaker at 604p. Turnover was 3.2m shares. SmithKline Beecham dropped 8 to
475p and Wellcome 22 more to 754p.

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI/Zeneca advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh surge of buying interest in ICI shares on Wall Street overnight set
the tone for the newly-demerged group, with most of the buying in the stock
said to have reflected switching business by international broking houses.
Dealers said it was significant that ICI and its former bioscience arm,
Zeneca, had made progress, while the big international pharmaceutical
stocks, such as Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome had given up
significant ground.
ICI shares were among the FT-SE 100 index's best performers in London on
Tuesday, when they spurted from an opening 608p to close at 636p. Yesterday,
they took another substantial leap forward, opening sharply higher at 658p
and quickly moving ahead to touch 674p before settling a further 37 1/2 up
at 673 1/2 p.
Both classes of Zeneca stock moved ahead, shrugging off the sluggish opening
performance on Tuesday. Zeneca ordinary shares battled gamely and closed 4
higher at 634p, after 637p, albeit after only moderate turnover of 2.9m
shares, well below Tuesday's debut turnover of 10m. The new shares settled 3
higher at 37p, after 39p, on 4m traded.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission's move to grant special exemption
to marketmaking firms involved in the underwriting of the Zeneca rights
issue, allowing them to purchase Zeneca shares in a 'passive' role if the
market price goes below a 10 per cent discount to the rights price in the
final five days of the offer, was another positive for the market.

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: MEPC strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge in property shares increased speculation that MEPC would shortly
follow the example of some of its rivals and call for cash from the equity
market. There were strong rumours that such a move might accompany the
company's interim results today, with market talk suggesting a right issue
in the order of a 1-for-4 to raise Pounds 250m. An issue of this size would
catapult MEPC back towards the FT-SE 100, and also take the amount of money
raised by the property sector in recent months to over Pounds 1bn.
Property analysts also expect the second line stocks to turn to shareholders
for extra funds in the very near future. Great Portland Estates and Frogmore
Estates were two names being hinted at in the market yesterday. MEPC shares
rose 26 to 448p, Great Portland 22 to 205p and Frogmore 17 to 404p.

<TEXT>
THE BURGEONING appetite among investors for property shares was further
whetted yesterday when British Land unveiled a partnership with Mr George
Soros, the US investment specialist, sending property shares soaring and
leading the London market sharply higher. Almost overshadowed by the new
joint venture were British Land's results, described by one analyst as
'scintillating', as well as its Pounds 132m 4-for-17 rights issue.
British Land shares galloped forward on news of the Soros deal announced at
the opening of the session, which some institutions underweighted in
property stocks took as a signal that the recovery in the property market
had been duly sanctioned. But dealers said that the large trading volumes of
some leading stocks masked a series of agency crosses. Marketmakers were
also caught out by the developments and stock shortages underpinned some of
the rises.
While many analysts continued to caution over embracing the sector
wholesale, arguing that quality differentials among the long-depressed
stocks were highly significant, yesterday's rises were indiscriminate.
British Land jumped 46 to 344p - its highest level for three years - on
turnover of 4.5m. Hammerson, long considered a potential target for British
Land, was immediately thrown back into the bid limelight, its shares
climbing 11 to 349p. Elsewhere, Land Securities surged 30 to 583p, Brixton
Estates 20 to 218p, while the second liners also caught the mood and forged
ahead strongly. Estate agent Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, in which the
British Land chairman has an 11 per cent stake, jumped 8 to 42p.
The Soros move into the UK commercial property market, via the link with
British Land, triggered a strong upsurge in bank stocks. Barclays, believed
to have the largest exposure to commercial property in the UK, jumped 11 to
467p with a substantial 8.9m shares changing hands, the heaviest
single-day's turnover for some weeks.

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares gain on renewed confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEXPECTED link-up in the UK property industry between Mr George Soros
and British Land provided a strong stimulus to confidence in the London
stock market yesterday. Driven by gains in British Land and other leading
property stocks, the FT-SE Index extended its advance into its latest
trading range by nearly 20 points before closing well below the best as US
investors continued to sell pharmaceutical stocks after Wall Street opened.
A secondary support for investment confidence came from hopes that political
pressures might yet induce the new UK chancellor of the exchequer to cut
base rates, although these were restrained by the Bank of England's actions
in the money markets and by renewed warnings on inflation from the president
of the Bundesbank, ahead of today's policy meeting at the German central
bank.
The latest UK money supply data, however, encouraged speculation on domestic
rate cuts and the London markets were not wholly convinced by the Bank's
actions in the money markets. 'Mr Clarke (the new UK chancellor) has little
to lose by cutting rates,' commented Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull.
The FT-SE Index closed 13.8 up at 2,863.0, after touching 2,868.7 at
mid-session. This left the market still comfortably inside its latest
trading range, which will not be seriously tested until the Footsie reaches
the 2,880 area. UBS, the London securities arm of the Swiss bank, yesterday
raised its year-end forecast for the Footsie to 3,100, indicating a total
return for the year of around 23 per cent; UBS is setting the same target
for 1994.
The rebound in confidence was shown most clearly in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
which jumped by 25.1 points to a new peak of 3,191.4. However, trading
volume in the non-Footsie stocks which make up the bulk of the Mid 250 Index
made up only 56 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 601.9m shares. On
Tuesday, when the London market was very slow to return from the extended
holiday weekend, Seaq volume of 401.9m shares was worth only Pounds 841m in
retail, or customer, business, the lowest daily figure for many months. The
London market has enjoyed a virtually unbroken run of Pounds 1bn daily
customer business levels since sterling left the ERM in mid-September last
year.
Among the strongest sectors in the Footsie 100 stocks list, property shares,
represented by a gain of more than 5 per cent in Land Securities, stood out.
But the implications for their loan books of a revival of confidence in the
UK property market also boosted the domestic clearing banks, where Barclays
and National Westminster moved ahead.
Firmness in the US dollar helped sentiment among the international stocks
but this was overshadowed by further, determined selling of the
pharmaceutical sector by US investors. Downward pressure on Glaxo was
increased when a UK investment bank moved to sell the share options heavily
at mid-session. Wellcome was another weak feature in the pharmaceuticals
sector.
The gathering clouds over drug stocks, which have been driven by
uncertainties over the Clinton administration's healthcare policies,
continued to benefit ICI, which again attracted significant support from
investors both in the UK and in New York.

FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERAL excitement in the equity market that was kindled by developments
in the property sector underpinned trading in the derivatives, though
volumes remained thin, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,869
with sentiment boosted by the strong overnight performance on Wall Street.
But selling shortly after the opening brought about a temporary retreat in
June and it fell to the day's low of 2,863.
However, the positive mood generated by the developments in the property
sector and continued speculation of a cut in interest rates in both the UK
and German combined to bring about a recovery in the fortunes of the June
contract.
A firm gilts sector also assisted trading during the afternoon and June
reached the day's high of 2,879 just after 3pm. Following a bout of
profit-taking in the dying minutes of the session, June finished at 2,865,
in line with the underlying cash market. Volume remained poor reaching 6,270
at the official close.
The turnover in the traded options remained low in spite of showing a
significant improvement. Total volume was 22,974 lots against 14,683 on
Tuesday. Just over 5,400 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 and Thames
Water, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option with a
day's total of 3,460 contracts.

<TEXT>
AFTERNOON buying of blue chip electronics stocks boosted activity, and share
prices gained ground in an otherwise quiet market, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed up 100.29 at 20,691.70, after a low of
20,561.59 and a high of 20,823.91 in the afternoon. The index closed off its
high on arbitrage unwinding just before the close.
Volume rose to 434m shares, against 382m. Gainers led losers by 578 to 427
with 174 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced
8.21 to 1,645.46 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.92 to
1251.73.
Technical analysts said that the index saw support at the level of the five
week moving average, around 20,400.
A fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life insurer, said that
it had bought shares below the 18,000 level, and saw current prices as
expensive when taking fundamentals, such as corporate earnings into
consideration.
US pension funds were seen buying electricals, pushing the sector up by 1.8
per cent to lead the day's winners. NEC, the most active issue of the day,
rose Y30 to Y1,060 and Fujitsu gained Y35 to Y800.
Mining, however, was the biggest loser, falling 1.5 per cent on lower gold
prices. Mitsui Mining and Smelting fell Y12 to Y571, while Sumitomo Metal
Mining fell Y30 to Y1,100.
Toagosei Chemical jumped Y60 to Y700 on reports that it had developed a
non-toxic pesticide, which also fertilises crops.
Speculative issues gained ground on buying by short term dealers. Nippon
Carbon rose Y11 to Y699. However, Nissan Motor, which was recently purchased
on speculative interest, lost Y21 to Y736.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y7,000 to Y972,000, while large capital
issues were mixed with Nippon Steel retreating Y1 to Y400 and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries advancing Y4 to Y716.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 128.65 to 23,063.96 in volume of 21.7m
shares. Investors bought high-technology issues, while constructions and
financials were also higher.
Roundup
THE region saw a mixture of performances yesterday driven mainly by domestic
issues.
HONG KONG fell back on news that China had decided not to support its
currency on some of its semi-official swap markets. The news affected
companies with a significant exposure to China as the yuan declined sharply.
The Hang Seng index lost 53.58 to 7,322.23 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn
against Tuesday's HKDollars 3.9bn.
Stocks such as Henderson Land, New World Development and Hutchison Whampoa
bore the brunt of the day's declines, due to their heavy commitment to
Chinese projects.
Both the SHENZHEN and SHANGHAI B share indices eased , the latter by nearly
6 per cent.
SINGAPORE was led lower by declines in Cycle and Carriage. The Straits Times
Industrial index fell 4.13 to 1,890.31 with Cycle and Carriage down 30 cents
to SDollars 6.95. The stock has been active since last Friday's announcement
that Jardine Matheson had raised its stake to 24 per cent.
SEOUL was strong in pharmaceuticals on expectations that the government
might provide financial support. Dong-A Pharmaceutical registered the daily
limit high of Won800 to Won20,000 and Il-Yang Pharmaceutical rose Won1,000
to Won25,300.
The composite index advanced 7.84 to 758.81 in turnover of Won984.9bn.
MANILA fell on news of a contraction in first quarter GDP, although some
analysts remarked that the figures were slightly better than expected.
The composite index shed 7.7 to 1,572.56 in turnover of 192.2m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR improved on Tuesday's record high although activity was
reported to have been less active as brokers imposed buying restrictions on
retail investors.
The composite index edged up 1.21 to 741.27 as volume slipped to 337m shares
against Tuesday's 391m.
JAKARTA also hit a second consecutive peak, banks rising as the JKSE index
closed 4.14 higher at 345.99 in active trade.
AUSTRALIA was lifted by a strong industrial sector and a recovery in the
futures market. The All Ordinaries index gained 8.0 to 1,741.9. Turnover was
ADollars 290.4m.
The gold index fell 71.1 to 1,868.9 as the price of the commodity fell both
locally and overseas.
BANGKOK was encouraged by strong buying of two newly listed property groups
and the SET index closed 2.06 higher at 820.90 in turnover of Bt4.3bn.
BOMBAY rose on short-covering in thin trade, the BSE index closing 52.46
higher at 2,245.20.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US prices flat as May jobless
data awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended mostly flat as investors turned their attention toward
tomorrow's eagerly-awaited May employment report, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.11 at 3,553.45, a
fraction short of its all-time high. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's
500 ended 0.02 firmer at 453.85, while the Amex composite finished 1.37
higher at 439.97, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.52 at 705.80.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 287m shares. After Tuesday's solid gains,
prices opened lower in light trading, although by mid-afternoon they had
crept back into positive territory. In the absence of a lead from the bond
market, which held steady, or from gold prices, which rebounded slightly
after the previous day's big declines, investors focused on the day's
economic news, and on tomorrow's release of May jobs data. This will give
the markets the latest reading on the current state of the economy.
Economic figures yesterday were inconclusive. April home sales, up 22.7 per
cent on the month, came in well above forecasts, and failed to lift prices.
Instead, investors paid more attention to the April index of leading
economic indicators, which showed a modest rise of 0.1 per cent. Analysts
had expected an increase of about 0.5 per cent.
MCI Communications, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 1
5/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after announcing that it had sold a 20 per cent stake
to British Telecom for Dollars 4.3bn and agreed to establish a Dollars 1bn
joint venture to develop the two companies' North American
telecommunications businesses. ADRs in British Telecom fell Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 65 1/8 . Tambrands fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 43 after the
company warned second quarter earnings would fail to meet last year's
levels. Drug and healthcare stocks came under selling pressure. Syntex fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 after the Food and Drug Administration
rejected its application to sell an over-the-counter version of its Naproxen
painkiller. Leading drug stocks elsewhere fell on reports that the release
of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform proposals will probably be
delayed until July. Fear of prolongued uncertainty about the proposals left
Merck Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 37 1/4 , Schering-Plough down Dollars 1
7/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 , Johnson&amp;Johnson Dollars  1/2 weaker at Dollars 44
1/4 , and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 59 1/2 .
Healthcare stocks on the Nasdaq also tumbled.
Canada
TORONTO STOCKS closed steady in heavy trading. An active session closed
narrowly mixed as a recovery in oil and gas and precious metals issues
offset tumbling consumer products.
A plunge in heavily weighted Seagram Co shares took the consumer products
index down 97.19 to 6,262.31.
The TSE-300 finished 2.95 points higher at 3,859.82 on turnover of 76.54m
shares valued at CDollars 668.17m. Declines led advances 350 to 355, with
277 issues steady.
Seagram fell 1 1/8 to 35 3/8 in brisk trade. It posted operating net profit
of USDollars 0.43 per share versus USDollars 0.41.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Construction stocks weaken in
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were mostly uncertain yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose overall, the DAX index closing 5.32 higher at 1,625.21, but
sentiment was susceptible to bearish news at the level of sectors and
individual companies.
Turnover rose from DM3.5bn to DM3.7bn. Construction stocks weakened
following Tuesday's bearish note on the sector from Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, Bilfinger &amp; Berger dropping DM9 to DM945, Hochtief DM19 to
DM1,090, and Philipp Holzmann by DM15 to DM960 after setting its rights
issue price at DM650 a share a day earlier.
Mannesmann, which fell on Tuesday after a slide in 1992 earnings and a
dividend cut, lost another DM3.20 to DM247.80 as news focused on the
forecast of a loss for the first half of the current year.
The day's exception was the trading, metals and engineering group
Metallgesellschaft, which announced a 39 per cent drop in first half profits
but gained DM10.50 to DM302.50 because, said brokers, expectations had been
even worse.
MILAN was unnerved by the discovery of a car bomb near the parliament
building which came soon after the arrest of another Mafia leader. Some
analysts commented that although this bomb had been defused, the fact that
it had been planted, in spite of increased security following last week's
explosion in Florence, could deter the inflow of foreign investment. The
Comit index lost 3.41 to 541.80.
The market was also depressed overall by a 6 per cent fall in Fiat, down
L350 to L5,590 on the kerb, having fixed at L5,810.
There were rumours that some Fiat shareholders, including US investment
funds, might be considering legally contesting the group's annual accounts.
Support for the market came from Stet and Montedison, which saw respective
gains of L60 and L32 to L3,250 and L1,182. However, on the kerb both
retreated to L3,185 and L1,157.
PARIS moved in a narrow range with activity reported to have been moderate
throughout the session. The CAC-40 index slipped 3.04 to 1,875.84, after a
day's high of 1,881 and a low of 1,863. Turnover was estimated at a low
FFr1.9bn.
Peugeot slipped just FFr1 to FFr530 on provisional reports of a 24 per cent
fall in sales in May and forecasts of a 13 per cent fall in new car sales in
France this year.
Total advanced FFr1.70 to FFr266.30 after the group forecast steady first
half operating profit. Bouygues was another strong performer, up FFr8 at
FFr678, as the group said that it was confident about the outlook and
announced the award of a FFr500m contract in Hong Kong.
Elf Sanofi put on FFr12 to FFr924 as investors continued to react to
Tuesday's news that it was to co-operate with two US groups in the
development of new drugs.
ZURICH ended mixed to slightly higher, the SMI index rising 6.0 to 2,258.9
in thin volume. BBC Brown Boveri, which placed 126,147 bearer shares on the
bourse at just below market price, fell SFr12 to SFr818 although analysts
said that the dilutive effect of the new shares was minimal.
BRUSSELS saw falls in senior blue chips as the Bel-20 index fell 10.13 to
1,182.66. Societe Generale de Belgique lost BFr65 to BFr2,105 and Petrofina
BFr170 to BFr8,000 as the bourse reacted to bearish economic news.
STOCKHOLM was pressured by a decline in the forestry sector, partly as a
result of the weaker dollar. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 13.6 or
1.3 per cent to 1,068.9 in turnover up to SKr957m from SKr752m.
Stora, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, dropped SKr15 to SKr314 in the
A's and SKr8 to SKr321 in the B's.
HELSINKI fell sharply on profit-taking for the second successive day, the
Hex index losing 31.9, or 2.7 per cent to 1,155.0, 9 per cent down from its
May 21 peak. OSLO fell on the weaker dollar and higher money market rates,
the all-share index losing 4.35 to 470.11.
TEL AVIV fell again, the Mishtanim blue chip index losing 3.14 to 200.19 on
sales by speculators and small portfolio managers.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw slows after meteoric advance -
But share prices have risen by 175 per cent since Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warsaw's Stock Exchange (WSE), which has experienced a spectacular rise
since Easter, seemed to be slowing down this week. But many of the 100,000
people who now have accounts with brokers enabling them to buy and sell the
18 quoted stocks are still hoping that the bonanza will continue.
The WSE, which was set up in April 1991, is modelled on the French order
driven system, with share prices allowed to move by no more than 10 per cent
up or down per session. But it only really caught the popular imagination in
the past two months as share prices started to rise, sometimes by ten per
cent, on each of the three days a week that the exchange is open for
trading.
Turnover rose, too, from around 30bn zloty per session in the first months
of the year to around 350bn zloty in the past few days with a record 414bn
zloty (Dollars 24.4m) on Monday when the average share price rose by a mere
3 per cent; this presaged a 2 per cent fall on Tuesday, turnover easing to
354bn zloty.
Since Easter the WIG index, the exchange's main indicator, has risen by 175
per cent from 1,350 to Tuesday's 3,710, delighting Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the
WSE chairman. But Mr Rozlucki is now urging investors to be prudent out of
fear of the damage the exchange could suffer as the result of a crash.
The rise in equities has come against a background of a slight dip in bank
interest rates which prompted savers to look elsewhere to make their
investment. However, as Mr Rozlucki likes to point out, the exchange is
still so small that it would take a mere two per cent of people's bank
deposits to buy every stock quoted on the exchange. Even now, the exchange's
capitalisation has reached no more than Dollars 782m.
At the same time the past few months have seen investors from abroad, who
now account for 25 per cent of daily turnover, moving in with regular buy
orders for each session giving prices their steady upward trend. These
include around five investment funds led by Invesco's CEAM, one of the
earliest investors on the WSE.
In turn, this upward trend has attracted the attention of speculative money,
almost literally off the streets with people in the last few weeks buying
stocks with scant regard for company prospects, profits or p/e ratios but
mesmerised by the fact that a near-30 per cent, untaxed, profit was to be
made in some weeks.
The scale of 'investor' interest can be measured by the fact that 19,000 new
accounts have been opened with brokers since the end of March.
The market has tended to favour companies such as Electrim, a
telecommunications and power equipment trader, Wedel, which is controlled by
PepsiCo, and Mostostal, a building company; all of these are seen as having
good prospects.
The rise, of course has also lifted price/earnings ratios, from an average
of 3 in the early months of this year to around 10 at present.
The excitement has spilled over into new issues, with queues forming days
ahead of the recent sale of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which was
heavily oversubscribed, and which should give the purchasers a handsome
bonus when first quoted on the exchange on June 22. Queues have already
formed for two other issues, the Vistula garment factory in Krakow and a
meat works in Sokolow Podlaski, which make their debut on June 7, and also
promise to be a success.
However, companies quoted on the exchange have not taken advantage of the
market's mood to raise money through new share issues. Nor, indeed, has the
privatisation ministry moved quickly to make new public offers, or private
companies decided to go public.
Admittedly such procedures take time, but by the time the principals get
around to it, the exchange may be on the way down. Part of the reason for
the delay is that equity offers oblige ompanies to divulge information about
their results and, in some cases, dilute existing management control. Polish
companies, and foreign companies operating in Poland remain wary of that.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Home sales boost the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR made a strong comeback against the D-Mark yesterday in the wake
of strong US economic indicators and a new bout of weakness for the German
currency in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
In early morning trading in Europe, the dollar was lingering around the
DM1.5810 level against the D-Mark, still reeling from last Friday's huge
downward revision in the first quarter GDP figures.
However, a remarkable increase in the new home sales figure for May took
dealers by surprise: the sales were up 22.7 per cent on the month at
751,000, their best performance since September 1986 and dwarfing market
expectations of a 642,000 rise.
The indicator helped to push the dollar up to a close of DM1.5975 from a
previous DM1.5920.
Compounding the dollar's strength was a new day of weakness for the D-Mark
in Europe.
The D-Mark ought to have remained firm after the Bundesbank announced that
there would be no change in the repo rate, still at 7.60 per cent - but the
decision appears to have been discounted by many dealers.
According to Mr Mike Gallagher of IDEA, the market information group, the
source of D-Mark weakness was the peseta's powerful performance in the ERM
with only four days before the Spanish general election.
Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the opposition Partido Popular,
underpinned the peseta by stating that, if elected, he would only introduce
interest rate cuts after taking the currency's value into account.
A more significant factor helping the currency was the strong performance by
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist prime minister, in a live tv debate with
Mr Aznar on Monday night. Mr Gallagher said: 'The performance was good
enough to raise speculation that, as in the UK, the governing party could
snatch victory at the last moment in the general election.' The peseta
closed at Pta78.24 from a previous Pta78.91.
The unwinding of short peseta positions contributed to general D-Mark
weakness. The Italian lira closed at L913.9 from a previous L923.9, and the
French franc at FFr3.369 from a previous FFr3.376.
The single exception was sterling which closed  3/4 of a pfennig down on the
day, at DM2.4625, on expectations that the UK authorities could cut base
rates again.
Yesterday's money supply figures provided further evidence that the UK
recovery is slowing. Rate cut flames were also fanned by the Bank of
England's decision to offer a repo rate for only two weeks, at a date that
falls just after Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Mansion House Speech. Some
dealers think that a two-week repo is an unusually short date for an
instrument, and that the Bank might be planning change of policy afterwards.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Money Markets: UK optimism fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER getting very bullish on Tuesday about the prospect of another UK base
rate cut, sterling futures dealers were a little less certain about the
outlook yesterday, writes James Blitz.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as UK chancellor last week has raised
speculation that he might cut UK base rates later this year in a bid to
stimulate the economy.
Yesterday morning, the enthusiasm which had seen the September contract bid
as high as 94.32 on Tuesday dimmed a little.
Sterling's weakness against the D-Mark, opening more than a pfennig lower in
London at DM2.4645, pushed the contract down to 94.26 at the start of
trading yesterday.
That mood was compounded a little later, after the Bank of England forecast
a shortage of Pounds 1bn at the start of its daily operations yesterday, but
did not offer a repo in the early round. Some dealers felt this implied that
the authorities wanted to keep conditions tight for the time being.
However, before lunchtime, the Bank surprised the market by offering
wholesale funds to commercial banks at a maturity of 2 weeks. Some dealers
expressed surprise that the Bank had not offered funds for the more normal 3
week period, and speculated that a policy change might be in the offing
around the time of Mr Clarke's first Mansion House speech.
Another factor adding to rate cut speculation was the poorer than expected
UK money supply number, which showed a 3.3 per cent increase in Britain's
narrow measure of money for May, providing further evidence that the UK
recovery is slowing.
By the close, the September contract was at 94.29, 4 basis points down on
the day. Three month money was up from 5 7/8 per cent to 5 15/16 per cent on
the day.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, helped short-dated German
futures to rise yesterday after saying that Germany's recession could be the
worst since the second world war.
Mr Schlesinger's comments encouraged dealers to think that the Bundesbank
would continue its policy of small cuts in short-dated interest rates,
despite its decision to leave the repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent.
The September Euromark contract closed up 8 basis points on the day at
93.28.

The main wool selling seasons in the southern hemisphere are in their final
month and offerings at auction are tailing off. Last week's South African
sale was cancelled because of inadequate offerings, and a New Zealand sale
was recently abandoned for the same reason. Australia meanwhile is a steady
market, with finer merinos still in keen demand. Prices gained a little
ground compared with last week but subsequently have just remained steady.
The AWC market indicator is 455c/kg compared with 453 a week ago.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean banana producers
attack Gatt challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN banana producers have attacked a plan by five Latin American
exporters to have a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
examine the European Community's new import regime, which becomes effective
on July 1.
The attack is part of the Caribbean producers' continuing war over access to
the European market.
At a meeting in Kingston, Jamaica over the weekend, trade and foreign
ministers from the Caribbean and Latin America discussed their divergent
positions on the marketing of the fruit. 'The discussions were frank,' said
Mr Charles Maynard, Dominica's foreign minister. 'We explained our position,
and they explained theirs.'
Latin American delegates to the conference said they were 'encouraged' by
last week's ruling by a Gatt panel that the EC's current banana import
regime unfairly limits Latin American exports. 'This is a clear indication
that new rules must be based on free trade,' one Latin American official
said.
'The proposed EC regime will also be contested and I have no doubt that the
tendency towards free trade will prevail.'
Caribbean and other producers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group
of countries are seeking protection for their market share in Europe and
fear competition from cheaper Latin American fruit.
The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a
quota of 2m tonnes a year for Latin American fruit, and that the quota will
attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78.8) a tonne. Imports of Latin American
fruit above that level will attract a duty of Ecu850 a tonne.
Caribbean and other traditional suppliers such as those in Africa will have
access for the remainder of the Community's needs - which traders say amount
to about 1.5m tonnes a year - and will pay no tariff.
However, Caribbean delegates to the conference feared that the conclusion of
last week's Gatt panel could influence Gatt council discussions on the
banana trade, which are to take place in a fortnight and also in the middle
of next month.
This, and the attempt by the Latin American producers to have a second panel
discuss the new regime, is regarded by the ACP group as a threat to the
arrangement and to their market.
'All of this is quite prejudicial to our economies,' Mr Maynard said. A
statement by the Caribbean Community Secretariat said the region considered
the Latin producers' attempt to have a second panel rule on the new regime
'as being particularly unjustified.
'The Caribbean banana producers have 3 per cent of the world banana market
and constitute absolutely no threat, neither to the Central American states,
which supply some 38 per cent, nor to the other Latin American banana
producing states which supply some 57 per cent,' the statement said.
Latin American delegates said they 'understood and sympathised with' the
concerns of the ACP producers, but stressed that they too had fragile
economies to protect and new markets to develop. 'We should not have to pay
a price for being efficient producers,' one said. 'The rules of world trade
must be respected by all, including the European Community.'
Such is the polarisation of positions on access to the EC that ministers
spent the first morning of the Kingston conference arguing over the place of
bananas on the agenda. Latin American ministers did not want the matter
raised while their Caribbean counterparts threatened to abort the conference
if it was not discussed.
The conference communique was terse in describing the nature of the debate.
'The ministers thoroughly and frankly discussed the problem of bananas,' it
said.

This week's retreat in the precious metals market yesterday took the GOLD
price to the lowest level since the middle of last month. After seeing the
metal slip to Dollars 370.25 a troy ounce, adding Dollars 5 to Tuesday's
Dollars 4.50 fall, some traders were suggesting that a test of support in
the Dollars 366 area might be on the cards. 'It all depends on New York,'
one dealer said. PLATINUM found the going even tougher and surrendered
Dollars 14 to reach Dollars 382 an ounce at the afternoon fixing. Some
analysts, seeing this as an overdue technical correction, prompted by the
failure on Tuesday to push through resistance at Dollars 400 an ounce,
expected the upward trend to be resumed soon. SILVER ended 19 cents lower at
Dollars 4.41 an ounce, but some dealers saw that as a surprisingly robust
performance. They had expected support at Dollars 4.35 to give way, allowing
the price to slide to about Dollars 4.10 an ounce. At the London Metal
Exchange sterling's weakness helped the COPPER market to rally and the cash
position closed Pounds 19 higher at Pounds 1,166.50 a tonne.
Higher-than-expected US housing start figures also encouraged buyers.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's private farms still a
rare breed - Removing state control from farming is proving a slow process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX MONTHS ago Mr Anatoly Chibatkov, a 52-year-old state farm director from
Russia's grain-growing region of Volgograd , decided to leave the state farm
and set himself up as a private farmer. So he bought himself a shiny, red
tractor, applied for a plot of land - and then plunged into a conflict that
has not only split his village of Gorodizhe, 30km outside Volgograd city,
but is dogging many of Russia's farming regions.
'The situation here is like an agricultural battle,' said Mr Chibatkov, as
he bumped along in a battered jeep over the land that he has now finally
wrested from state control.
By all accounts it is a battle that is being fought across much of Russia's
vast terrain, as the republic attempts to introduce market economics into
its huge and inefficient agricultural sector.
In the two years since Russia embarked on its programme of agricultural
reform its farming community has been deluged with new legislation and
directives. These have had three main prongs. First, a drive to distribute
former state land to new small, private farmers; second, an attempt to
reorganise the huge state farms that have dominated Russian agriculture
since collectivisation in the 1930s; and third, an attempt to break down the
monopoly of the state distribution networks that supply farms with inputs
and sell their produce.
Seen from the Moscow offices of the Russian agriculture ministry, the
statistics, so far, have been significant. In the past 18 months the number
of private farmers in Russia has risen from a few hundred to nearly 250,000
and is predicted to reach a third of a million by the end of the year.
At the same time, some 23,000 of the 26,000 state farms have officially
reorganised themselves into shareholding companies or co-operatives. And
though statistical information on the agricultural distribution networks is
sparse, the appearance of new grain exchanges and small private shops across
Russia suggests that, in some areas at least, the old state monopolies are
being whittled away.
Meanwhile, with the 1992 net grain harvest some 10 per cent higher than in
1991, most agricultural officials are now confident that the decline in
Russian agriculture has been halted, if not yet reversed.
'Reforming the agricultural sector in Russia is harder than any other
industrial sector, because it has traditionally been very conservative,'
says Mr Valentin Denisov, head of agrarian policy at the agriculture
ministry. He believes that, in spite of 'many existing political conflicts',
market reforms are here to stay.
But out on the farms scattered across Russia, the message is rather more
mixed.
Although the move to private farming has been the initiative that has so far
attracted the most attention from the media and the West, private farmers
still control only a tiny proportion of farming land and produce a mere 3
per cent of the overall commercial agricultural produce.
Meanwhile, in the sector where reform will ultimately be most crucial - the
huge state farming sector - 'reorganisation' has sometimes been little more
than a renaming exercise. And although it is hoped that competition from
private farmers might eventually infect the state farms with some
entrepreneurial zeal, many state farms have become distinctly anti-market in
their outlook as their brightest and most energetic specialists have left to
set up their own private farms
The story of Mr Chibatkov would seem to be a case in point. Eighteen months
ago he decided to turn his 7,000 hectare (17,000-acre) grain and livestock
farm into a joint stock company. So the state property was 'given' to the
farm, shares distributed to all the farm workers - together with guarantees
of future dividends - and attempts made to reverse declining production. at
the farm.
But within a year his workers were in revolt. Fed up with the new working
regime and paper 'shares' that had failed to provide the promised dividend,
they voted to oust Mr Chibatkov and turn themselves into a co-operative.
In practice, this meant running the state farm much as before - although
each of the 2,000 villagers was given 'rights' in a piece of land, the farm
director continued to manage the land.
'We are trying to make the workers' brigades become financially
self-accounting, but this has been difficult,' explains Mrs Tatiana
Chuchmanova, the farm accountant.
At this point Mr Chibatkov, together with two dozen of the youngest and most
energetic villagers, used their new 'legal rights' to apply for land and
machinery from the farm. The farm, reluctant to recognise this new 'law',
refused to give them equipment - but after a long battle finally gave them
21 ha of land each, ready for the the winter ploughing.
Barring any political turnabouts, they should now survive to the end of the
year. Although the plots of land they received were too small to be viable
as independent farms, they persuaded some of the other villagers to lease
their state farm land and now have 90 ha. 'Ideally we would need three times
more,' Mr Chibatkov says.
At the same time, by setting up an equipment pool with five other farmers
and using the contacts and know-how he gained as state farm director, Mr
Chibatkov has acquired seed, credit and equipment. The local factories in
Volgograd have sold his pool four tractors and two trucks, the local bank
has given them a five-year loan, and the local agricultural research
institute has provided them with some 100 tonnes of seed.
But by all accounts Mr Chibatkov has been one of the luckier ones.
Over in the agricultural Russian republic of Mordovia, for example, the
picture for the republic's private farmers is considerably bleaker, not
least because the local government is now locked in conflict between a
reformist government, which supports land reform, and a conservative
parliament, which is opposed to it.
Mr Ivan Zavetkin, a farmer in the Mordovian village of Chamsinka, for
example, set himself up as a private dairy and grain farmer several months
before Mr Chibatkov. But with no tractor factory in Mordovia and no powerful
contacts in the local government, he is still struggling to get access to
the equipment he needs.
The local agricultural bank says it has not received enough cash from Moscow
to provide credit. The local state farm is insisting that it will only sell
him grain seed if he sells most of his harvest back to the farm at reduced
prices. And Mr Zavetkin's attempts to set up an equipment pool with the
other farmers have failed, because their land is too widely scattered.
For the moment Mr Zavetkin and his colleagues insist they have enough pigs
and cows to survive, even if they are unable to sow their grain.
But the dairy operation also labours under special difficulties. 'Private
farmers have to sell their unpasteurised milk themselves in the market, or
sell it to the state farm at very low prices,' explains Mrs Tamara Tureneva,
Mordovian welfare minister. She says her attempts to set up a private milk
factory have been foiled by local state farm 'Mafia'.
For the moment, farmers like Mr Chibatkov remain fairly optimistic. 'We have
our land, our seed and our tractors - we are ready for the market,' he says
cheerfully. But the next - and ultimately most important - struggle will be
persuading the local state farm that it should get ready for the market too.

THE AUSTRALIAN wheat crop will be 14.58m tonnes in the year ending March
1994, according to the latest prediction by Australian Wheat Forecasters, a
private forecasting agency, Reuter reports from Melbourne.
AWF's new figure is up from the 13.83m tonnes it estimated last month but
still well below 1992-93's harvest of 15.33m tonnes.
'Over the past month the main development has been the frequent and heavy
rains that have fallen in Western Australia,' the agency said, adding that a
series of four periods of rain since April had allowed growers to prepare
fields and sow seed grain in Australia's biggest wheat producing state.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead prices steady as two more
smelters cut output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE lead smelters announced production cuts yesterday, forced on them
by prices that in real terms are the lowest on record. Analysts pointed out
that, in recent weeks, refined lead producers had ordered annual cuts of
between 160,000 and 200,000 tonnes, and such moves were bound to have an
impact on market sentiment and prices before long.
'Western lead producers have finally capitulated. They are having to stand
aside to make way for metal from the former eastern bloc,' said Mr Nick
Moore, an analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group.
However, yesterday the market seemed unimpressed as Nuova Samim, the Italian
state-owned group, said it would close its Portovesme smelter for two months
at a cost of 30,000 tonnes of production, and MIM Holdings, the Australian
company, said it would cut 3,000 tonnes from output by shutting secondary
(scrap) furnaces at its Britannia Refined Metals plant in Northfleet, UK.
On the London Metal Exchange, lead for delivery in three months closed at
Pounds 267.50 a tonne, up only Pounds 1.75, and that rise almost exactly
reflected the day's fall in the value of sterling against the US dollar.
Mr Moore suggested: 'The market is sometimes a bit of a dinosaur. You bite
its tail and it takes a while for the message to reach the sharp end.'
He pointed out that the price was equivalent to roughly 18 US cents a pound
 -well below the 30 cents required to encourage new production capacity.
'This is an anomaly that can't be sustained.'
In recent weeks, lead smelter production cuts have been made in Canada by
Cominco, in France and Germany by Metaleurop and Metallgesellschaft, in
Sweden by Boliden and in Japan by a number of companies.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, insisted that cuts in lead production were
likely to have an impact much more quickly than cuts in zinc.
'When demand from the US replacement battery sector begins to pick up over
the next few months, we might well start to see the lead market tightening,
particularly in the US,' he said. 'Although there might not be a marked
resurgence in prices, we are certainly less pessimistic for lead in the
second half of this year than we are for zinc or, indeed, for other base
metals.'
Last year, the lead market was shocked by a huge increase in net imports
from the former eastern bloc, up from 63,000 to 173,000 tonnes. The rise
left the market with a 163,000 tonnes supply surplus, according to the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group. In the first quarter of 1993 there
was a surplus of nearly 50,000 tonnes.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (8): Search for technology - Research and
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In the past five years, our research and development has lagged behind wage
rises. This is the principal reason for our deteriorating trade balance.'
Mr Kim Chul-Su, Korea's trade and industry minister, was scarcely
exaggerating when he addressed foreign journalists last month. Korea badly
needs technology to compete in world markets.
Foreign competitors are understandably reluctant to supply it, given Korea's
reputation as an industrial powerhouse. But research is not Korea's strong
point. According to one western analyst, the country's total expenditure on
research and development last year was less than that of General Motors.
R&amp;D is now high on the agenda of both government and industry. Mr Young
Soogil, a senior economic adviser to the government, says: 'For the past
couple of years, the Ministry of Finance has been working on what we call
the G7 project. There are 11 specific advanced technologies in which we'd
like to be self-sufficient by the year 2010.
'We don't want advanced capability in most areas, but in niche technologies.
The ministry's model is Switzerland, which is not an advanced country in
terms of the spectrum of technologies but has unique capability in specific
areas. This strategy would give us room for strategic alliances with other
countries.'
In other words, Korea is looking for bargaining power. This applies equally
at the corporate level. At Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology,
outside Seoul, Mr Kang Jong-Hoon says: 'In the 1970s and 1980s, we had to
buy everything. All the technologies were coming from outside. We just
assembled, using cheap labour, and re-exported to the US. That's not the
paradigm any more. We don't have cheap labour or cheap materials. Since all
our competitors are well aware of our situation, they don't want to sell us
technology any more.
'Then, it was like an elementary school kid begging from an uncle. Now it's
a high school kid. Some day, we want to be eye to eye with a company like
Sony. But the key is bargaining for technology.'
In the past, Korean companies have not always been scrupulous about
intellectual property rights. In that respect too, life is getting harder.
At Samsung Electronics' headquarters in Seoul, Mr Kim Hun says: 'Technology
transfer is getting harder. Companies around the world are finding business
slow, so they are looking more closely at the value of their patents.
'A good example in our industry is Texas Instruments, which made more than
half its money from its patents last year. The Americans and the Japanese
are both pushing us into a corner on patents. That's why we have to have our
own new technologies. Even if we have one single technology which the others
don't have, that puts us in a better bargaining position.'
But Samsung is at the sophisticated end of Korean industry. Whether the
average Korean manufacturer can or should devote time and money to genuinely
new technology is an open question. A western diplomat says: 'Everybody is
talking about high technology at present, but they can't actually get into
communications technology or advanced materials. Their strengths will be
more in the sophisticated end of shipbuilding or cars.'
The Korean tradition is not notably inventive in terms of pure research. A
senior British executive in Seoul says: 'The Koreans don't have lateral
thinking in their education system. And their R&amp;D establishments are
commercially funded, so perhaps too targeted. Maybe the Koreans should send
more people to British universities.'
One of those commercially funded establishments is the Institute for
Advanced Engineering in Seoul. The Institute, which was set up last year,
aims to combine industrial research with running a graduate school for PhD
students. It is funded by Daewoo, one of the nation's large conglomerates,
and works almost exclusively on Daewoo projects.
The Institute's president, Professor Chung Kun-Mo, ticks off some areas of
interest: car engines, heavy water nuclear reactors, manufacturing
technology in shipbuilding and earth-moving equipment. Most of the list
sounds like intermediate technology, of a kind which the new government has
recently been recommending to industry.
Professor Chung does not wholly accept this. 'The point is synthesis. The
government's emphasis on intermediate technology has a lot of merit, but
it's often misunderstood. What we're talking about is highly sophisticated
technology in sectors where intermediate technology has been used
traditionally.'
Take, for example, steelmaking. 'A traditional steel mill is intermediate
technology. But you can employ all kinds of laser technology, for instance,
and microsecond diagnosis of the product.'
Or take textile manufacture, where Daewoo is heavily involved. 'Nobody yet
knows how to use micro-electromechanical devices here, but we're working on
it. You can use sensors to determine the thickness of a thread, but when it
comes to speed it has to be controlled by experience. It should be possible
to control that through local sensors.
'Or take engines. At how many points of an auto engine do we use sensors?
There could be a lot more diagnostic sensing used on a continuous basis, to
improve engine efficiency. If we can make cheap diagnostic sensors and
control mechanisms, we can produce a much more efficient engine from
existing types. Some scientists want to go to the laboratory and start from
scratch. We say, let's make money by improving those industries which have
been milk cows for us in the past.'
Understandably, there is a defensive undertone here. As a newly high-wage
economy, Korea is being hustled out of low-cost industries such as textiles,
and is naturally anxious to slow down the process. But there are some
industries - notably electronics - where the tone is more aggressive.
At Samsung's research laboratories, Mr Kang says: 'There are areas where we
lead the world: in the digital video disc recorder, or in some fields of
semiconductors.' But despite individual successes, Mr Kang is realistic
about the task ahead. 'In semiconductors or flat display panels, we have a
gap of one or two years. In product design, or making things that are
compact, look good and work well, we've got a lot to do. The problem is that
as a young company, we had to concentrate on the hot technologies. To excel,
you need to be good at everything.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (10): Perplexing facet of industrial miracle
/ Profile of Posco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company (Posco) illustrates to perfection the
perplexing nature of the Korean industrial miracle.
The company was set up by the government in 1968 as part of a hugely
ambitious plan to make Korea a global force in heavy industry. It was headed
from the outset by a career army officer who ran it - with massive
government backing - on strict military lines. Last year, when the new
democratic government took over, he abruptly resigned.
It sounds a classic story of Third World grandeur gone wrong. The reality is
quite different. Posco is the world's third-biggest steel producer, behind
Nippon Steel of Japan and Usinor Sacilor of France and ahead of British
Steel. The French and British companies have recently announced heavy losses
while Nippon Steel has forecast a collapse in profits. Posco, a decently
profitable company with a conservative balance sheet, increased its net
earnings last year by more than a quarter.
Then again, Posco's rivals do not have its domestic market. The Pohang mill
is less than an hour's drive away from the world's biggest shipyard and the
world's biggest car plant. Demand for steel in Korea is slowing. But
according to Mr Chung Tam, a steel analyst with the broking firm BZW in
Seoul, it should still grow at about 10 per cent a year for the rest of the
decade. 'Demand for steel has always outpaced supply in Korea', he says.
'That's expected to continue.'
Posco is not necessarily counting on it. Last October it completed its
second steel mill - again, the world's biggest - at Kwangyang on Korea's
south coast. But Mr Chung Myung Sik, Posco's chairman, says: 'The phase of
rapid steel expansion is already over. We're not going to build any more
steel capacity in Korea.'
Instead, Posco will continue its recent policy of diversifying into areas as
remote as telecommunications, construction and agrochemicals. In this, it is
imitating its Japanese rivals. But they are driven to it by the need to
employ their redundant steel workers. They are also for the most part losing
money in their new activities. Posco is not under the same obligation.
There is another paradox. Korea's big conglomerates, the chaebol, are under
pressure from the government to focus their activities more closely. Posco,
a highly-focused company still largely controlled by the government, is
going the other way.
'We believe', says Mr Chung, 'that we should enter areas where we have
expertise. Our cash flow is substantial and we have large manpower resources
and an extensive R&amp;D capability. We're looking for areas to utilise our
capital, our manpower and our technology.'
But what does a steel company know about telecoms, for example? Plenty, says
Mr Chung. Posco has its own very large and sophisticated communications
system. Or construction? 'We have our own highly developed construction and
engineering management team. Their capacity far surpasses any other company
in Korea. If we don't use them, they'll wither away.'
So how far will the balance shift away from steel in the long run? 'We don't
have a specific goal or time-frame. But steel is presently 95 per cent of
our turnover. It would be quite realistic to see it coming down to 70 per
cent by the end of the century.'
The other question which looms large for Posco is its relationship with the
government. Last October, the founder, Mr Park Tae-Joon, resigned abruptly.
His successor as chairman was then voted out at the AGM: and the chief
shareholder is the government, which still owns 35 per cent of the shares
and controls another 20 per cent or so through the banks. Then the
government, in a familiar Korean tactic, sent in the tax authorities for the
first extensive tax audit in Posco's history. Is Posco the subject of a
witch-hunt?
Absolutely not, says Mr Chung. 'That's unfounded speculation, and
misleading. Clearly, our former chairman was involved in politics. But if
this tax audit is exhaustive, and clears the company, it could be what the
company needs. It's only a three-month survey of our tax position. Others
have been longer, and we're a big company. I'd urge the tax authorities to
take as much time as they need.'
Has there been any change in management strategy? 'The long-term policy of
not growing in volume steel was already there. There's no basic change in
that. But in the way the company is managed, there will be substantial
change. The first 25 years saw a continuous expansion of the corporation.
The management style was top-down. In the next 25 years, the present
management think we need fuller utilisation of the manpower which
constitutes the company. We will change away from the military-style
leadership of the past. We have reached the stage where that emphasis on
leadership is counter-productive. The company needs to be more creative and
participative. There has been a feeling among the workforce that creative
thinking has been stifled and that participation has been blocked off. We
need to use that potential.'
All this is put in context back at the Pohang mill. A senior executive
criticises the workforce for its insubordinate attitudes. Why, he says, they
have even started objecting to wearing off-duty uniforms on their way to and
from work. Clearly, if Posco wants to shed its military image, it has some
way to go.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (7): New president sets the pace - Clampdown
on corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING his first three months as South Korean president, Mr Kim Young-sam
has presided over a bloodless revolution of the political establishment that
promises to transform the country into one of Asia's most democratic
societies.
The sweeping changes initiated by Mr Kim, the country's first civilian
leader in 32 years, are meant to eliminate the vestiges of the previous
authoritarian system, while making the government more accessible and
accountable to the public.
Mr Kim, a former opposition leader, has accelerated the pace of political
reforms that began with the downfall of the military dictatorship in 1987
and were continued by his predecessor, Mr Roh Tae-woo, a former army general
with a strong commitment to promoting democracy.
The changes he has introduced range from the symbolic, such as reducing the
august trappings of the presidential office, to the substantial, including
imposing firm civilian control over the military and curbing the domestic
surveillance operations of the intelligence agency.
An anti-corruption campaign, however, has produced the biggest impact.
Corruption is pervasive in South Korea because the centralised and
authoritarian government structure allowed officials to wield considerable
power and extract bribes in return for favours.
When Mr Kim recently ordered government ministers and MPs to disclose their
assets, many were revealed to have amassed fortunes of several million
dollars due to suspected corruption, including the use of inside information
to engage in property speculation. The government audit agency, meanwhile,
is investigating ministries for corruption, while senior bureaucrats will
soon be required to reveal their wealth.
A prominent target has been the military, with former service heads and
other senior officers accused of accepting bribes for promoting colleagues.
There are also allegations of widespread corruption involving the
procurement of weapons.
Four state-appointed bank presidents have been forced to resign because they
demanded bribes for granting loans. Not even the respected education system
has escaped unscathed, with administrators confessing they accepted bribes
to allow students to enter universities without taking the entrance
examinations.
The anti-corruption drive is considered the main weapon in reforming the
bureaucracy by curbing its abuse of power. The exposure of corruption is
meant to destroy the use of government as a patronage system.
Mr Kim's advisers argue that by depriving bureaucrats of the opportunity to
exploit their positions for personal gain, they will have less incentive to
retain control. This will weaken bureaucratic opposition to other proposed
reforms, such as economic deregulation, while promoting more equality
between citizens and the state.
The new president has set an example by declaring he will not accept
political contributions for the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in an
attempt to break the corrupt relationship between government and business,
which is the main source of donations. Business has welcomed the reform
since an estimated 6 per cent of profits are paid as a 'quasi-tax' to
politicians to ensure favourable treatment in government decisions.
The anti-corruption campaign has earned Mr Kim immense popularity, with a 70
per cent approval rating. The anti-government student riots that were once a
hallmark of Seoul in springtime have disappeared as long-time dissidents
voice support for the new government.
Mr Kim has also skilfully used the anti-corruption campaign to strengthen
his political position. His opponents in the DLP, who are mostly associated
with former President Roh, have been thrown on the defensive since they were
forced to disclose their large personal fortunes. Several haves resigned
their parliamentary seats, including the speaker of the National Assembly.
The president's reform programme has also deprived the main opposition
Democratic Party of a strong alternative message to attract voters. It was
defeated decisively by the DLP in three parliamentary by-elections last
month.
If any criticism can be made of the anti-corruption drive, it is that Mr Kim
has used it to settle some personal scores.
The authorities, for example, are conducting an extensive tax audit of
state-controlled Pohang Iron and Steel, whose former chairman opposed Mr
Kim's presidential candidacy last year.
More significant has been the prosecution of Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder of
the Hyundai business group, for illegal election funding in his presidential
campaign against Mr Kim. The charges against Mr Chung forced him to abandon
the United People's Party, the political group he financed, leading to its
virtual collapse as the country's second opposition party. The DLP has been
able to attract some defecting MPs from the UPP, increasing the strength of
the ruling party to 170 seats in the 299-member National Assembly.
The aggressiveness Mr Kim has shown in tackling corruption has surprised
most observers, who initially dismissed him as a politician of the old
school despite his impressive record in opposing the military dictatorship.
Doubts about Mr Kim arose after he abandoned the opposition in 1990 and
joined the ruling party in what was regarded as a nakedly ambitious attempt
to become the government's presidential candidate in last December's
election.
Some analysts now believe that Mr Kim's switching of political affiliation
may be the source of his current success. 'His reforms are based on a
compromise between the establishment and the opposition, with Kim having a
foot in each camp,' says Mr Ahn Chang-ni, a professor of political science
at Seoul National University.
But it is expected that Mr Kim will inevitably confront a backlash from the
old guard threatened by the reforms, especially if his popularity weakens.
Mr Kim has already been forced to drop several ministers and a close aide
who was leading the anti-corruption campaign after his opponents leaked
information to the press about alleged ethical violations involving them.
Moreover, questions remain about the sources of financing for Mr Kim's
presidential election, which could prove embarrassing.
More practical considerations could also limit the extent of the
anti-corruption drive. The government, for example, has delayed banning
financial accounts held under false names, which are used to hide money from
tax collectors, because this could lead to a flight of capital from the
country.
There is concern that the anti-corruption campaign is slowing
decision-making among bureaucrats who fear being accused of corrupt
practices. The probe into military corruption may also be cut short on the
grounds that it is demoralising the armed forces, although a more pertinent
reason is that Mr Kim does not want to provoke the military.
But Mr Kim also faces pressure from the public, which has come to expect a
wholesale cleansing of government, to continue the reform process.
Having opened the Pandora's box on three decades of official corruption, the
new president may have difficulty in closing it again even if it is prudent
to do so.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (5): A daunting task ahead - Foreign direct
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Koreans want only three things from us. They want our cash, they want
our technology and they want us out.'
The remark, from a senior western businessman in Seoul, contains a nugget of
truth even if it is not wholly serious. It also illustrates a genuine and
pressing problem for the Korean economy.
Historically, Korean industry's competitive edge was largely based on cheap
labour. In the past few years, that advantage has disappeared. Korea now
urgently needs technology to allow it to compete with the developed world.
Generating that technology will take time. In the meantime, Korea needs to
import it.
But when it comes to foreign direct investment, the Korean tradition is
scarcely welcoming. 'They're not very internationally minded', says Mr Alan
Timblick, head of Barclays Bank in Korea. 'A foreigner making profits is
still seen as exploiting Korean workers. And they don't want to see the
re-conquest of the peninsula by the Japanese by financial means.'
The point is developed by Mr Sakong Il, formerly Korea's finance minister.
'Korea was exceptional among most developing nations in that it relied
principally on foreign-borrowed capital rather than equity. One reason was
the experience of Japanese colonialism. There was a reluctance at the level
of both government and firms to allow direct investment. Another reason is
that Koreans are independent by nature. If two Korean companies agree to
share technology, that's big news here.
'A third factor is economic. Korean companies had negative real interest
rates, because of fiscal subsidies and high inflation. From the viewpoint of
a Korean entrepreneur, if you allow foreigners to get equity you have to
share those benefits. The government wasn't very accommodating for the same
reason.'
Of late, however, the foreigners have started to get the message. Mr Jack
Leber of Samsung Hewlett-Packard, co-chairman of the American Chamber of
Commerce's investment committee in Korea, says: 'Foreign investment has been
down for the past four years and last year Korea was ninth out of nine
countries for investment in Asia. You've now got Dollars 50m a day going
into China and the Koreans can see that.'
Mr Timblick says: 'The Koreans are waking up to the foreign exodus. For the
first time last year, more companies left than arrived. That affects their
pride. It's one thing to be suspicious of foreigners raking in profits. It's
another to be shunned. It's exactly what they don't need at a time when they
should be upgrading their technology.'
Most foreign involvement in Korean industry is in the form of joint
ventures, which can be notoriously tricky in any country. Since the late
1980s, it has been possible for a foreign company to hold a majority stake
in a joint venture, or even to own a Korean business outright. But, says Mr
Alan Twist, head of ICI in Korea, 'foreigners are forbidden to hold land,
unless in high-tech industries. If you're a pharmaceutical company, you can
build a plant. If not, you can own the business 100 per cent, but you can't
build the factory. So in commodity chemicals, for instance, you'd still want
a local partner - partly for market access, but mainly to get hold of a land
bank.'
Another advantage of having a local partner, says Mr Timblick, is that it
brings access to the relevant trade association. 'That's vitally important
to market access', he says. A local partner will also be able to get hold of
finance. 'It's very difficult for a foreign company to persuade a Korean
bank to lend. Even a big company has to go through the local branch manager,
who never heard of you. That's changing a little bit, but the domestic
banking system is still very unsophisticated.'
But, says Mr Timblick, the history of joint ventures in Korea is not happy.
'There have been far more divorces than silver weddings. A foreign manager
will want to run his company according to criteria and accounting principles
determined at head office level. The Korean partner is likely to argue that
in Korea you don't go for return on capital but for market share, at least
until you've eliminated your competitor. It gets worse when you find the
manufacturing plant has outgrown the domestic market and the Koreans want to
move into overseas markets'.
Last year, a joint venture in vehicles between General Motors and Daewoo
broke up for just that reason, with Daewoo buying out GM's 50 per cent
holding.
Another commonly cited problem is the lack of protection for intellectual
property. Mr Twist says: 'The law on the statute books is now as good as
anyone else's, but the policing is patchy. In the Confucian culture, the
tradition is that the scholar talks to the people and that thought is free.
The concept of ideas as property is not well understood by the people, and
the government has a lot of trouble explaining that copying Gucci tracksuits
or American software is a crime.'
There is general agreement that the new government is making genuine efforts
to encourage investment - 'to liberalise 50 years of xenophobic
constraints', as one executive puts it.
But it is not plain sailing. Mr Leber tells of how Cargill, the giant US
food company, submitted an application to set up a soyabean processing plant
in December 1988. 'The local competition here made a 30-minute video to show
how they'd be hurt by it', he says. 'They finally got approval in January
1993. A similar application in Japan took only two years. Now they're
considering whether China might be a better bet.'
In any case, say the foreigners, the government is still only at the stage
of removing barriers, rather than providing active encouragement. 'The
Koreans have to realise', Mr Twist says, 'that their traditional approach of
nibbling at a mountain of constraints is not good enough. China, Taiwan and
Malaysia are offering incentives. Korea's just offering fewer
disincentives.'
Mr Leber agrees. 'In the four years I've been here, the Koreans have moved,
but others are moving faster. In China, things are moving fast and they're
making it easy.'
There is also disagreement about how fundamentally attractive Korea is in
the first place. Mr Timblick says: 'Korea used to be an area of great
interest in this region as a way into China: it had cheap labour, a
well-educated workforce and so on. But now that the Chinese are less
regulated and growing so fast, Korea risks getting bypassed.'
Mr Twist disagrees. 'I believe people can't have a strategy for the
Asian-Pacific region which excludes Korea. It's the second most advanced
industrial nation after Japan. In pharmaceuticals, Korea has 50 per cent of
the whole Asian market excluding Japan. Korea has very strong traditional
cultural links with north-east China, and Beijing is just an hour away.
'And Korea has a resource of very skilled operators. They know how to make
things like cars and computers. China doesn't have a skilled workforce. You
can't control the joint venture. It doesn't have the financial system, or
the legislation. It's still frontier land.'
Either way, Korea has little choice but to make itself more attractive. It
may even have to woo its traditional enemies. Mr Timblick says: 'The
government needs to change its mind on the Japanese. That's very difficult,
and it's unclear how it can be brought about. But they need to be allies
with the Japanese, which would be their salvation. They desperately need
Japanese technology.'
If the task sounds daunting, not every foreign observer is pessimistic about
the new government's ability to tackle it. Mr Leber says: 'They need to
change, and that'll be a challenge. But I think they'll do it. They have in
the past. And what's happened in the past few months is really remarkable.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (4): Threat of confrontation - Relations
with North Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, there was optimism that North and South Korea were on the path
to reconciliation and eventual peaceful unification.
The two countries had signed a non-aggression pact and a non-nuclear treaty
in December 1991. This was followed by North Korea's acceptance last spring
of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in
an apparent attempt to dismiss suspicions that it was developing a nuclear
weapon.
But relations since then have deteriorated to the point where the threat of
a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula has become a frightening
possibility.
The current crisis was sparked by North Korea's announcement on March 12
that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), an
action that increased worries that Pyongyang was determined to develop a
nuclear weapon.
The roots of the crisis, however, can be traced back to Seoul's demand last
year that North Korea accept challenge inspections of suspected nuclear
facilities in compliance with the bilateral non-nuclear treaty.
Pyongyang refused the request, which blocked progress in inter-Korean talks.
Seoul then adopted a carrot-and-stick policy. The carrot consisted of
offering aid to help rescue North Korea's struggling economy if Pyongyang
accepted inspections.
The stick was the resumption of the annual US-South Korean military 'Team
Spirit' exercise, which had been suspended in 1992 as a goodwill gesture in
response to North Korea's signing of the non-nuclear treaty with the South.
Pyongyang has routinely condemned previous Team Spirit exercises as a
rehearsal for a possible attack against North Korea. If the Pyongyang
leadership seriously believes its own propaganda, this year's Team Spirit
may have seem particularly alarming.
The holding of Team Spirit in mid-March occurred shortly before the expiry
of a deadline set by the IAEA for it be allowed to inspect two unreported
facilities believed to contain nuclear waste. Examination of the waste
material might confirm IAEA suspicions that North Korea is producing more
bomb-grade plutonium than it has declared.
Pyongyang then pulled out of the NPT, explaining it was doing so in response
to Team Spirit and the IAEA special inspection demand, which it described as
'a seditious political machination aimed at forcing us to open military
objects and bases and thereby leaving us disarmed militarily.' If it agreed
to the IAEA inspection, North Korea would also create a precedent for
accepting similar inspections by South Korea.
Many observers concluded that North Korea dropped out the NPT because it
feared that the IAEA was close to discovering that Pyongyang was indeed
developing nuclear weapons despite denials. North Korea is committed to a
producing a nuclear weapon because Pyongyang views it as the ultimate
guarantee against the country's absorption by the South, according to these
analysts.
The nuclear programme 'would provide the means to bargain with the outside
world for its acceptance of the permanent division of Korea,' Mr Zbigniew
Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, said in Seoul recently.
But there have also been other explanations for the North Korean action. One
is that it is connected to transfer of power from President Kim Il-sung to
his son, Mr Kim Jong-il. The junior Mr Kim needed to create a crisis
atmosphere to rally public support for his gradual assumption of power at a
time of economic hardship, while winning the backing of the military, which
is sceptical about his leadership ability.
Another theory is that North Korea is using its threat of withdrawal in a
desperate attempt to win concessions for its return to the NPT. These could
include gaining diplomatic recognition from the US and Japan, the right to
inspect US military bases in South Korea, a promise by the US not to attack
North Korea, and the permanent suspension of Team Spirit.
North Korea's diplomatic brinkmanship has paid dividends in the past. It
successfully managed to avoid falling under the influence of either China or
the Soviet Union, its Cold War patrons, by skilfully playing off the two
Communist rivals against each other. Pyongyang possibly believed that a
diplomatic gamble with the west could succeed now when new administrations
were taking office in Seoul and Washington.
Recognition by the US and Japan may be Pyongyang's chief goal. This would
reverse the diplomatic defeat North Korea suffered when Moscow and Beijing
established relations with South Korea.
The NPT withdrawal caught off guard Mr Kim Young-sam, South Korea's new
president, who wanted a more flexible diplomatic approach to North Korea.
The current crisis has also set back hopes in Seoul that the problem of
unification might be solved between the two Koreas without involving the
regional powers, the US, Japan, Russia and China. That has been considered a
desirable goal because it would symbolise Korea's autonomy in deciding its
own fate after a century of being dominated by outside powers.
But South Korea is now relying on the US and China to intercede directly
with Pyongyang to solve the NPT issue before North Korea's withdrawal
formally takes effect on June 12. Seoul could see the issue slip further
from its control as the UN Security Council becomes involved in the crisis,
including possibly imposing economic sanctions on North Korea if it does not
reverse the NPT decision.
Moreover, the crisis has exposed underlying tensions between Seoul and the
US. Seoul favours a conciliatory policy toward Pyongyang because it fears
that a hardline response could push the peninsula into war. It is willing to
grant diplomatic and economic concessions if North Korea returns to the NPT.
The US is likely to adopt a tougher attitude on North Korea because it views
the nuclear issue in a global perspective. It wants to prevent North Korea's
permanent withdrawal from the NPT because it could encourage other nations
to do the same. The US also fears that a renegade North Korea could provoke
a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia, while becoming the supplier of
nuclear technology to other anti-western nations.
But the Clinton administration, already preoccupied with other international
crises such as Bosnia, may be willing to concede diplomatic recognition as
the price to be paid for encouraging North Korea back into the treaty and
accepting inspections from South Korea.
Whether North Korea would accept such a deal depends on its true intentions
in provoking the crisis.
Even if the nuclear inspection issue is resolved, North Korea will remain an
unstable place. North Korea's rulers face a painful and profound dilemma.
They must open the country to economic reforms to prevent its likely
collapse from growing shortages of food and fuel, but to do so could cause
political instability that threatens the survival of the current regime.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (3): Government has retreated - Economic
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the new administration of President Kim Young-sam has moved rapidly to
introduce political reforms, it has made a slower start on promised economic
reforms.
That emphasis on priorities reflects the Mr Kim's personal preference for
politics instead of economics, a subject about which he readily confesses he
knows little. Nonetheless, the new president has surrounded himself with
economic reformers who want to reduce government control over the highly
centralised economy and replace it with a structure based on autonomy and
market forces.
The current system, which was once praised as a model for developing
countries, is now criticised as outdated for Korea's mature economy. The
government no longer appears able to guide industrial development
efficiently. Instead, the bureaucracy's taste for micro-management is
hindering a necessary restructuring of industry.
Mr Kim's administration initially appeared ready to make rapid changes when
it announced in March that most lending rates would be deregulated this
spring, while the practice of holding financial accounts under pseudonyms
would be banned in an effort to combat tax evasion.
But the government almost immediately retreated from these promises,
explaining that the measures would exacerbate the country's economic
problems. Deregulation would drive interest rates higher, while the
requirement to use real names in financial transactions would cause a flight
of capital abroad that could result in a credit squeeze, officials said.
Similar arguments have been used by previous administrations in justifying
the postponement of deregulation. The new government's reversal on these key
reforms provoked doubts about whether it is committed to a radical
restructuring of the economy.
Mr Suh Sang-mok, an influential ruling party MP, blamed administrative
confusion among new policymakers for the stumbling start on economic policy.
'Economic reform is a critical issue. The Korean economy will be in
disastrous shape if reform is postponed any further. The new government is
committed to change,' he said.
The true test of the government's commitment is its ability to fulfil the
extensive list of reforms contained in the draft of its five-year
(1993-1997) economic plan, which was released last month. The guidelines
cover three main areas:
Fiscal policy. The government wants to promote economic equality by
increasing the share of the public paying income taxes from the current
level of 46 per cent, while raising tax revenues from 19.4 per cent of GNP
in 1992 to 22 per cent by 1997.
It believes it can achieve this, while lowering actual income tax rates.
Instead, it will crack down on widespread tax cheating and close tax
loopholes. It plans to curb speculation in property and securities by
imposing tougher land taxes and introducing a capital gains tax.
However, the fate of the 'real name' financial transaction system, which is
considered instrumental in reducing tax evasion and eliminating insider
share trading, remains vague. The government only promises to 'create an
environment conducive' to its introduction and plans to propose an action
plan for its implementation.
The government, meanwhile, will cut its personnel costs and shift its budget
priority from defence to improving the nation's infrastructure, which is now
considered a bottleneck to industrial development. Spending will rise for
roads, railroads, harbours, airports, storage facilities and water
treatment.
Financial reform, which includes easing state controls on the banking sector
and reducing the government's role in credit allocation.
Most lending rates will be liberalised later this year, while almost all
interest rates will be deregulated by 1996. Restrictions on foreign exchange
transactions will be eased, while regulations on overseas investment,
foreign borrowings and local financing will be simplified or abolished. The
central bank will be granted more independence to control the money supply.
The proposed reforms, however, threaten the survival of the banking
industry, which carries a heavy burden of bad loans. The bad loans are the
result of prior government policy requiring banks to give loans at low rates
to strategic industries.
The reforms will force a reorganisation of the banking industry. Korea's 23
commercial banks will be encouraged to merge into bigger units and will be
allowed to expand into other financial sectors to broaden their earnings
base. Banks will also be granted more autonomy in managing their assets -
and their presidents will no longer be appointed by the state.
Industrial policy. The government has two main goals in industrial
restructuring. One is to reduce the economic dominance of the nation's large
conglomerates, or chaebol, while promoting the growth of small and
medium-sized companies. The other is to boost research and development
spending because Korea lacks strength in advanced manufacturing industries
that offer export potential.
Credit controls on the chaebol will be abolished as part of financial
liberalisation. But they will be replaced by tougher anti-trust laws to
force the chaebol to concentrate on a few core businesses instead of
operating a wide range of diversified activities. Institutional investors
will be encouraged to increase their shareholdings in the chaebol to reduce
the influence of the family owners that now dominate them. Restrictions on
individual chaebol will be eased if the group has a wide shareholder base.
The government will cease targeting industrial sectors for support and
protection, but will provide incentives for companies to increase R&amp;D
spending and conclude technical alliances with foreign partners to acquire
technology.
These broad proposals, however, are already subject to modifications as the
various government ministries negotiate in preparing a detailed blueprint
for the plan that is due by the end of June. There is concern that the
reforms could still fall foul of entrenched interest groups and other
political factors that have stymied previous attempts at change.
'The new government has difficult economic problems because previous
governments have deferred decisions on introducing reform,' says Mr Sakong
Il, a former finance minister and the current chairman of the Seoul-based
Institute for Global Economics. 'The one advantage this government has is
that the environment to take tough decisions has improved because it has
strong public support.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (2): Growth target set at 6% - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most countries would have been happy with South Korea's GNP growth rate of
4.7 per cent last year. But South Koreans regarded the performance as being
close to disastrous because it marked a 12-year low in economic growth.
Small wonder, then, that Mr Kim Young-sam, in an attempt to gain popularity
during his first month as the country's new president, announced in March a
stimulative package to show he was rapidly tackling economic problems. The
government has set a 1993 growth target of 6 per cent.
The main cause of the economic slowdown last year was sluggish demand for
Korean exports in its main overseas markets - the US, the EC and Japan -
which were in the middle of a recession. At home, a tight monetary policy,
which had been imposed to cool the overheated economy, dampened domestic
demand.
The quick-fix economic plan proposed by Mr Kim included providing subsidised
loans to small and medium-sized companies, which suffered a record number of
bankruptcies in 1992.
Administrative rules hampering business investment were eased. A cut of
0.5-1 per cent in regulated interest rates, which caused commercial rates to
fall below 10 per cent, was meant to boost fixed investments, which
contracted by 5.3 per cent last year. The government also brought forward
planned spending on infrastructure projects.
Mr Cho Soon, a strong advocate of the tight money policy, was dismissed as
governor of the central bank and replaced by Mr Kim Myung-ho, who supported
the government's decision to increase the money supply this year.
Critics, however, dismissed the plan as a panic reaction which would do
little to solve the structural problems that are hampering the country's
economic development.
The central problem confronting Korea's export-led economy is the loss of
international competitiveness due to the rise in labour and production costs
that followed the introduction of democracy and the growth of the trade
union movement. Productivity growth has not matched wage increases. This
development has coincided with increased trade competition from low-cost
producers, such as China and the south-east Asia countries.
Korea needs to increase the development of higher value-added products,
while reducing its dependence on labour-intensive light industries. But the
necessary industrial restructuring is being blocked by an ossified and
government-dominated financial system which is causing distortions in
capital allocation.
Mr Kim's announcement that he was delaying proposed financial liberalisation
measures - including interest rate deregulation, because it could adversely
affect economic growth this year - increased doubts about the new
administration's commitment to economic reform.
Instead, the new government appeared to be falling into the same
'stop-and-go' pattern of economic policy that characterised the previous
administration of President Roh Tae-woo, which boosted growth through state
intervention when the economy grew sluggish and then applied the monetary
brakes when the economy overheated in reaction to the stimulation measures.
'The number one priority of the new government is economic recovery. They
are reluctant to do anything that would hurt that recovery,' said Mr Lee
Hahn-koo, president of the Daewoo Research Institute.
But some economists argue that the government should have given the
stabilisation policy another six months or a year to work. They fear that
loosening credit controls now will rekindle inflation just as it is about to
be brought under control. Inflation fell from 9.3 per cent in 1991 to 6.2
per cent in 1992.
The government, however, argues that inflation will remain low because of
proposed limits on prices and wages. Salaries for state employees have been
frozen, along with charges for government services. The Korea Federation of
Trade Unions has tentatively agreed to accept a guideline on wage growth of
5-9 per cent this year against 16 per cent in 1992. The nation's big
conglomerates have promised to limit price increases on consumer products.
However, restrictions on wages could undermine the government's effort to
stimulate the economy, which has relied heavily on domestic demand for
growth during the past few years.
Low wage growth this year is believed likely to encourage consumers to save
rather than spend, particularly when the economic outlook remains uncertain.
Growth in private consumption has already fallen from 11.5 per cent in 1990
to 6.4 per cent in 1992.
The government hopes to revive industrial investment as a means to boost
growth, but that tactic also looks uncertain. Many industries have cut back
on investments because they are already burdened with excess production
capacity after a feverish expansion of facilities between 1986 and 1991.
One indication of weak corporate investment demand is that the banks are
finding it difficult to lend money to creditworthy borrowers for the first
time in a decade despite falling interest rates.
There are worries, however, that companies may take advantage of the
improved credit environment to expand into new business areas rather than
make sound investments in facilities and research and development.
Instead of business diversification, 'companies will need to become more
efficient in order to regain their international competitiveness,' according
to the Seoul office of Barclays de Zeote Wedd. 'The one risk is that the
government's loose monetary policy may lead to. . . delaying the pain which
many companies need in order to establish a sound business base.'
Many private economists estimate GNP growth will reach only about 5 per cent
this year because domestic demand will not significantly improve.
One bright spot, however, is the growth in exports. This is primarily the
result of the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen, which has
boosted sales of vehicles, petrochemicals, semiconductors and ships. But
rising exports also reflect the willingness of Korean producers to accept
marginal profits on overseas sales to reduce the excess stock that has built
up due to faltering domestic demand.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (1): Sluggish economy raises concerns - It
is ironic that democracy and diplomacy are blossoming in South Korea when
the state of the economy is provoking a crisis of confidence about the
nation's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
South Koreans, who celebrate the 45th anniversary of their republic this
year, have arrived at a unique moment in their nation's long history.
After centuries of unbroken authoritarian government on the Korean
peninsula, the southern half has suddenly developed into a vibrant democracy
that is one of the most liberal in Asia.
Mr Kim Young-sam, who was elected last December as the first civilian
president in more than 30 years, appears determined to complete the
country's transition to democracy that began with the downfall of the
military dictatorship in 1987. During his first three months in office, Mr
Kim has laid a stable foundation for political reform by making government
more accessible and accountable to the public.
He has curbed the power of the military and once-feared intelligence agency
and imposed firm civilian control over them. More importantly, an
anti-corruption campaign has been launched to remove the culture of 'money
politics' that pervades government and society and enriched those at the
top.
Revelations about bribery among senior government officials, military
officers, university administrators, bank presidents and corporate
executives have become the daily fare of the country's unfettered media.
What is happening now in South Korea has parallels to the current political
upheaval in Italy and Japan, but with one key difference. While lowly
Italian and Japanese prosecutors have been the chief agents in exposing
political scandals, the anti-corruption campaign in South Korea is being led
from the president's office with little apparent regard to who it affects,
whether friend or foe.
In contrast to the changes sweeping through the Korean establishment, the
streets of Seoul have become quiet after years of anti-government student
demonstrations. It is one sign that the new administration has gained
widespread public confidence.
In foreign policy, South Korea has also gained respect among the regional
powers that tried to dominate the peninsula during the past century and
often made the Koreans feel they were mere pawns in great power politics.
As South Koreans prepare next month to mark the 40th anniversary of the
armistice that ended the Korean War, they note with satisfaction that the
last year has seen them being wooed by China and Russia, the two countries
that supported North Korea's invasion of the South in 1950.
Beijing established diplomatic relations with Seoul last August in what was
a setback for Pyongyang, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin paid a visit
to South Korea in November during which he declared that Moscow would no
longer militarily support North Korea.
South Korea's democratic progress and its new stature as a regional power
reflects its economic success. The rise of an affluent educated
middle-class, with per capita income having more than doubled from Dollars
3,110 to Dollars 6,800 in the past five years, has promoted political
stability.
The potential that South Korea offers as a source of foreign investment is a
key reason why China and Russia have developed ties with Seoul.
It is ironic then that democracy and diplomacy are blossoming when the state
of the economy is provoking a crisis of confidence about the nation's
future.
Last year's GNP growth rate of 4.7 per cent, although enviable by present
global standards, was the country's poorest economic performance since 1980
when Korea was reeling from the twin shocks of President Park Chung-hee's
assassination and the rise in Opec oil prices.
The sluggish economy has raised concerns about whether Korea can regain its
position as one of most dynamic nations in Asia. Although outsiders may
dismiss such fears as exaggerated, the economic performance is troubling for
Koreans, who grew accustomed to double-digit growth during the mid-1980s.
Moreover, the country is once again wrestling with its traditional problems
of high inflation and current account deficits after appearing to solve them
five years ago.
These developments coincide with growing competition from the low-wage
countries of south-east Asia and China, which have grabbed market share from
Korean manufacturers as their labour costs have risen to the highest level
on the Asian mainland in the past five years.
It is one reason why Korea has slipped from 11th to 13th place in the global
ranking of export nations since 1990, with Korean officials predicting that
the country will drop to 14th place this year.
The economic challenges confronting Mr Kim's administration are formidable.
Not only must Korea return to balanced economic growth, but it also needs to
introduce important structural changes to improve its international
competitiveness.
Korea needs, for example, to spend more on research and development if it is
to become an advanced industrial nation. Total corporate R&amp;D spending in
1992 amounted to Won2,228bn (Pounds 1.78bn), less than what is spent on
research by General Motors or IBM.
Instead of pursuing research, most Korean companies prefer to invest their
earnings in automating their production facilities as wages grow or to
speculate in the property and stock markets in order to raise cash and
service their huge debt burdens.
Foreign companies are cautious about transferring technology because of
Korea's weak protection of intellectual property. Foreign investment in
Korea is another source of technology, but foreign investment is declining
and disinvestments are growing.
Financial liberalisation will help solve these problems. The country's
antiquated and state-controlled financial system has led to the inefficient
allocation of capital to industry, which is hindering economic development.
A deregulated capital market would eventually lower financial costs and
improve corporate balance sheets, allowing companies to pursue such
long-term goals as research.
But financial liberalisation will only be achieved through reform of the
bureaucracy and politics. Officials have resisted giving up control of the
financial system because it is one of the most important centralised powers
the government still retains.
State control of the economy has amounted to a giant patronage system, with
companies making contributions to politicians and bureaucrats in return for
economic favours. Mr Kim's anti-corruption campaign is meant to weaken
bureaucratic resistance to change.
But reform will not be easy because the bureaucracy has always played a
strong autocratic role in Korea's Confucian society. The battle for
democracy has now shifted from establishing a fair electoral system to
diluting bureaucratic power.
One 'wild card' factor that could derail Mr Kim's reform programme is North
Korea. Few Koreans believe that Pyongyang's confrontation with the
international community over nuclear inspections will lead to war.
But if the issue is not resolved soon, the UN could impose economic
sanctions on North Korea, which could eventually cause its struggling
economy to collapse. Seoul fears that possibility almost as much as war
because South Korea would have to divert massive resources to reconstructing
North Korea and consequently delay its own vital restructuring of industry.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Wishful thinking over German interest
rates lifts prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets regained some of their previous losses to
close higher on the day, helped by some wishful thinking that the Bundesbank
might ease interest rates as early as today.
German bond prices picked up sharply towards the close of dealing in London.
The recovery was driven by short-covering of positions as some dealers
decided to double-guess the Bundesbank ahead of its meeting today.
The central bank has been signalling for some time that it is reluctant to
lower interest rates because of the poor money supply figures recently.
However, there was a perverse argument taken by some in the market that the
signals have been intentionally misleading.
The June bund futures contract opened down at 93.91 and fell sharply in the
morning to 93.58 as the Bundesbank's money market repo drained DM5.5bn from
the banking system and left the interest rate at 7.6 per cent. This was
compounded by some stop-loss selling when the contract touched 93.68.
A short-squeeze forced a reversal and the June contract climbed to finish 21
basis points higher than Tuesday's close at 94.06 and 15 points higher on
the day, with heavy turnover of nearly 79,000 contracts. The September
contract was also heavily traded as dealers began to roll over into the far
month.
THE June bond future on the French Matif exchange was dragged up by the
performance of the bund market to close 8 basis points stronger at 116.70.
THE prospect of a further base rate cut in the UK and a feeling that the
bond market had been oversold helped to lift gilt prices yesterday, with the
long end of the market gaining over half a point.
Figures released by the Bank of England yesterday showed that foreign
investors, who have been keen buyers of gilts over the past three months,
took up Pounds 1.59bn in April, the highest monthly investment for more than
a year.
Buyers have been taking advantage of the relative weakness of sterling and
one economist argued yesterday that the Bank would be happy for the pound to
hit DM2.60 before it intervened.
US Treasuries were mixed in light trading yesterday as investors and dealers
awaited tomorrow's publication of the May employment report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 103
1/8 , yielding 6.873 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/32 at at 99 29/32 , to yield 4.158 per cent.
After Tuesday's big rally, which was sparked by a sharp decline in gold
prices, the market settled down yesterday. Dealers reported that activity
was unusually light, with many players choosing to digest their gains and
wait on the sidelines until tomorrow's release of the May jobs data.
Yesterday's economic figures were mixed. Although April's index of leading
economic indicators rose only 0.1 per cent, below market expectations,
investors chose instead to focus on the day's bearish news, which came in
the form of a 22.7 per cent jump in April home sales.
The surprisingly strong home sales number led to sporadic selling in early
trading, but by the afternoon longer-dated prices had recovered their
losses.
IN Tokyo, the strength of the yen and consequent high price of government
bonds encouraged profit-takers to move in.
The price of the Japanese government bond futures contract for September hit
a high of 107.42 on the strength of the currency and of US Treasury bonds.
However, leading city banks sold into strength and brought it down to 106.95
by the close of dealing in Tokyo, dealers said.
The trend continued in London on modest volume but dealers said a two-way
view was developing as foreign investors, who had been heavy buyers of
Euroyen bonds, began to see them as fully valued and started to switch into
government bonds.
AUSTRALIAN government bonds recovered from their trouncing on Tuesday caused
by the very disappointing level of the current account deficit. The
seasonally adjusted figure for April came in at ADollars 1.79bn against
predictions of around ADollars 1.2bn.
Heavy selling pushed the yield on the 10-year government bond up by 15 basis
points to 7.73 per cent but an improvement in the Australian dollar against
its US counterpart helped the yield to tick back to 7.64 per cent yesterday.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms set for Chilean deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLEW of sovereign and corporate names hit the Eurobond market yesterday,
with borrowers tapping mainly the dollar, Ecu and D-Mark sectors.
Among emerging market names, Celulosa Arauco Y Constitucion, the Chilean
pulp and forestry products group, attracted considerable attention with a
very aggressively priced deal.
The Dollars 150m five-year deal marks the first time that a Chilean borrower
has launched a straight bond issue, according to Chase, the lead manager.
Compania de Telefonos de Chile, the Chilean telecommunications group,
launched a convertible bond issue earlier this year.
Mr Jorge Jasson, managing director of the international capital markets
group in Chase, said the bond was priced to yield 210 basis points over the
relevant Treasury bond, making this the tightest launch spread from a Latin
American name.
The proceeds will be used partly to pay off existing debt and extend its
maturity, while Dollars 50m will be used for working capital. The company
does not have an international credit rating, but Chase said it carries the
top local rating.
'The deal will go well - they can afford to price it aggressively as a lot
of people have been looking for Chilean paper,' said one dealer.
The Kingdom of Sweden turned to the Ecu sector yesterday with an Ecu500m,
seven-year deal. Sweden has borrowed in a broad range of currencies
recently, and bankers estimate it is now about halfway through its borrowing
programme for the year.
Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager, said it looked at recent
seven-year Ecu issues from the EIB and France for reference when pricing the
deal. These two deals were yielding 7.19 per cent and 7.47 per cent
respectively, while Sweden was priced to yield 7.516 per cent at launch.
Dealers said the issue went fairly well and was expected to appeal to both
retail and institutional investors in search of current-coupon Ecu paper.
The Republic of Portugal, which recently had its credit rating upgraded by
Standard &amp; Poor's, took advantage of the good news by tapping the D-Mark
sector.
The DM 1.5bn, 10-year issue, will be priced today at between 27 and 30 basis
points over the 6 3/4 per cent bund due 2003. Dresdner Bank, the joint lead
manager, estimated that the recent upgrading probably translated into a 5
basis point saving for Portugal.
In the dollar sector, France's Compagnie Bancaire launched a Dollars 300m
two-year offering of bonds via Paribas Capital Markets. Dealers said the
issue was fairly priced at 70 basis points over the comparable US Treasury.
Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank of Hungary yesterday launched a DM100m bond
issue and so became the first east European commercial bank to tap the
international capital markets since the collapse of communism.
The state-controlled foreign trade bank priced the five-year 9 1/2 per cent
Eurobonds to yield 324 basis points above the comparable benchmark German
government bond.
The lead manager of the deal was Bayerische Landesbank, the German bank
which last year expressed interest in taking a stake when Kulkereskedelmi
Bank is privatised. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
broke new ground by acting as senior co-manager.
The D-Mark market was a 'natural choice,' Kulkereskedelmi Bank said. Germany
is Hungary's largest trading partner and the bank is Hungary's main financer
of foreign trade.
The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, has also paved the way for
Hungarian borrowers with a series of DM bonds culminating this April in a
DM1bn issue carrying a coupon of 9.25 per cent.
However,the German roadshow for Kulkereskedelmi coincided with the Hungarian
finance ministry's announcement that gross domestic product could fall by up
to 3 per cent rather than show the 0 - 3 per cent growth first forecast.
At the same time a report by the World Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston
showed capital problems at the Magyar Hitel Bank and Kereskedelmi Bank, the
two largest Hungarian commercial banks.
The news prompted fears that the financial community might lump
Kulkereskedelmi together with Hungary's more troubled institutions but the
bank, which the report estimated has a capital adequacy ratio of 16.1 per
cent, was judged on its own merits.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Nomura cuts domestic bond
issue commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOMURA Securities, the leading Japanese securities house, will cut its
underwriting commissions for domestic straight bond issues starting this
month.
The move comes ahead of the entry of banks' securities subsidiaries into the
underwriting business after a partial easing of barriers between the
country's banking and securities industries last April.
Until now, underwriting of domestic corporate bond issues has been dominated
by the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi.
Nomura will cut its commissions by Y0.05 per Y100 face value. The move is
the first cut in commissions since the fixed price reoffering method was
introduced into the Japanese market in December 1991.
Bond market analysts welcomed the move, saying that market competition in
pricing had finally started to appear.
Nomura has cut the commission for Tokyo Electric Power's Y150bn three-year
straight bond, to be issued later this month, from Y0.45 to Y0.40.
The reduction in underwriting commissions comes as Japan's primary corporate
bond market is changing its pricing and fee structures to entice Japanese
issuers away from European bond markets.
Nomura Securities International, a subsidiary of Nomura, has appointed Mr
Raymond Carli as treasurer and senior vice-president, replacing Mr Kevin
Farrell, Reuter reports from New York. Mr Carli joins Nomura from CS
Holding's First Boston Pacific affiliate.
Profits at Japan's Big Four brokerages' overseas units fell sharply in the
year to March 31, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The profits were hit hard by the sluggish Tokyo stock market, which
prevented Japanese companies from issuing new bonds and shares abroad,
spokesmen for Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi said.
Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, announced yesterday that it had
formally applied to the Bank of England to set up as a gilt-edged market
maker.

MITSUBISHI Trust and Banking, the Japanese trust bank, plans to cut its
workforce of 7,200 by 10 per cent over the next three years in an attempt to
improve core profitability.
The country's seven trust banks, which face mounting problems with
property-related lending, have just reported an average 26.7 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the year ended in March.
Mitsubishi Trust said the bank wanted to cut administrative costs by about
10 per cent over the next three years, when trust bank profits are likely to
be under pressure unless there is a sudden turnround in the ailing property
market.
However, Yasuda Trust and Banking said yesterday the banks had not yet begun
to include interest due on loans from their trust account in calculating
interest revenue, and insisted that its most recent profit statement
included only interest already received.
For the first time, the banks announced their non-performing loans, which
ranged from Y73.1bn (Dollars 664.5m) at Nippon Trust Bank to Y561.8bn at
Mitsubishi Trust. However these figures do not necessarily provide an
accurate measure of the relative pressures on the institutions.
Mitsubishi Trust is regarded as one of the stronger trust banks, and the
Japanese definition of non-performing loans gives banks a lot of flexibility
in calculating their totals.

KEPPEL Bank of Singapore, owned by diversified marine conglomerate Keppel
Corp, will today offer 100m new shares and 20m vendor shares for public
subscription. The offer will come in three tranches at SDollars 2.40 a share
or more, Reuter reports from Singapore.
The offer, which closes on June 17, will enable the bank to be listed on the
main board of the local bourse.
Of 120m shares, 42m will be issued at a fixed price of SDollars 2.40 each,
while another 42m shares will be sold though a tender with a minimum price
of SDollars 2.50.
The remaining 36m shares have been privately placed with three financial
agencies, at SDollars 2.50 per share, it said.
Twenty million shares have been taken up by the Investment Company of the
People's Republic of China (Singapore); 10m by Malaysia's Southern Bank; and
the remaining 6m by American International Assurance. 'For the fixed-price
tranche, each applicant may apply for up to 10,000 shares,' Keppel Bank
said.
The proceeds will be used to support the bank's operations in Singapore and
the rest of South East Asia. 'We have already applied for a branch licence
in Vietnam and will be applying for a representative office in China,' Mr
Benedict Kwek, Keppel Bank's president, said.
The issue is lead-managed by Keppel Bank and co-managed by Schroder
International Merchant Bankers. The issue is underwritten by a syndicate of
17 underwriters.
The bank's existing SDollars 1 shares total 331m. As at December 31 1992,
shareholders funds were SDollars 486m (USDollars 303.7m) and those of the
group, SDollars 514m.
Keppel Bank's net profits rose 20.6 per cent to SDollars 22.8m for 1992
against the previous year, while operating income climbed 42.8 per cent to
SDollars 105.8m.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Carolco agrees to Dollars 112.5m
infusion

CAROLCO, the cash-strapped independent Hollywood film studio, has agreed to
an infusion of Dollars 112.5m from a group of investors including
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, another struggling film producer.
Carolco hopes that the agreement, announced yesterday, will ensure its
survival as one of the film industry's premier film production studios.
Under the deal, which requires the approval of Carolco's shareholders, MGM
will acquire Dollars 30m of convertible notes, and the other investors -
Canal Plus of France, Pioneer of Japan, and Rizzoli of Italy - will buy
Dollars 82.5m of a new class of preferred stock.
The agreement will leave Canal Plus, Pioneer, and Rizzoli with 63 per cent
of the voting power of the company and MGM with 18 per cent.
The investors also agreed to satisfy part of a Dollars 32.2m loan made to
Carolco in March 1992, in exchange for the company's 51.7 per cent stake in
Live Entertainment, the music and video retailer.
Although Carolco has scored big box office successes with such films as
Terminator 2 and Basic Instinct, rising debts, incurred partly because of
lavish spending on big-budget films, have threatened to overwhelm it. Only
yesterday Carolco said it had defaulted on three different tranches of debt.
Last month the studio reported a loss of Dollars 88m for 1992, down from the
Dollars 265m loss incurred in 1991.
Yesterday's financing agreement comes five weeks after Tele-Communications,
the big US cable company, signed a letter of intent to invest Dollars 90m in
Carolco in return for the exclusive rights to show the studio's movies on
pay-per-view television.
News of the deal did not appear to impress the stockmarkets, where Carolco
shares fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 1 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which owns MGM, announced yesterday that Mr
Dennis Stanfill had stepped down as co-chief executive of the Hollywood
studio.
He will stay on as a senior adviser to Credit Lyonnais, helping the bank run
its entertainment and cinema interests.
The move, which follows reports in the Hollywood trade press last week that
Mr Stanfill was leaving MGM because of management differences with Credit
Lyonnais, leaves Mr Alan Ladd in sole charge of the studio.

<TEXT>
MR Tom Oliver, head of worldwide customer operations at Federal Express and
the effective 'number two' executive at the nation's largest overnight
delivery company, resigned yesterday. Mr Oliver said he was taking up the
post of chief executive and president of VoiceCom Systems, a San
Francisco-based voice processing services provider.
Also departing from Memphis-based Federal Express is Ms Carole Presley,
senior vice-president for marketing and corporate communications. She will
remain a consultant to FedEx but will start her own consulting business in
Florida.
Federal Express has suffered long-standing problems in its international
division and was forced retrench from an ambitious European expansion plan
last year. Since then, losses on the international front have been
diminishing, although competition has put pressure on domestic earnings.
Mr Oliver, 52, who had previously headed the international business, became
executive vice-president of worldwide customer operations in late-1991 when
chief operating officer, Mr James Barksdale, quit the company. Mr Oliver
subsequently oversaw much of the European restructuring action.
Yesterday, FedEx said Mr Oliver would be replaced by Mr William Razzouk,
currently senior vice-president of sales and customer service. Mr Fred
Smith, the company's founder, remains chairman.

GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, is dipping into its cash
reserves to reinforce its dominant position in the domestic market by buying
two small insurance companies.
The group is purchasing 50 per cent of Risparmio Vita and majority control
of Risparmio Assicurazioni, two subsidiaries of Turin's big city savings
bank. The two companies have premium income of L19bn (Dollars 13m) and L22bn
respectively.
The acquisitions, part of a closer co-operation between the insurer and the
bank in financial services, follow last month's increase in Generali's stake
in its growing Hungarian operation.
EA Generali, the group's Vienna-based subsidiary, raised its stake in
Hungary's Providencia Versicherung to 75.1 per cent from 56 per cent.
Providencia, created in 1990, is Hungary's third biggest insurer, with
650,000 customers and total premium income of Ft5.6bn (Dollars 63m) in 1992.
Premiums are forecast to rise to Ft8bn this year. The Generali group is
already active in Hungary through its majority-owned Generali Budapest
subsidiary.
Providencia made a net loss of Ft495m in 1992 as a result of costs
associated with building up a branch network. The company hopes to break
even by 1995.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Allstate's share offer largest

<TEXT>
SHARES in Allstate, the second largest car and home insurer in the US and
previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sears, Roebuck group, were
priced last night at Dollars 27. This is at the upper end of the indicated
price range for the flotation, which ranged between Dollars 24 and Dollars
27.
Last night's pricing makes the Allstate flotation the largest initial public
offering ever seen in the US. The company is selling 78.5m shares to outside
investors, including 10m to non-US investors. At the Dollars 27 price, this
will raise Dollars 2.12bn. Underwriters' over-allotment options, if
exercised, could take the total number of shares available to 89.5m.
Prior to yesterday's flotation of Allstate shares, the largest initial
offering in the US had come from Conrail. In 1987, the transportation group
raised Dollars 1.64bn.
In terms of all stock offerings - whether flotations or secondary offerings
 -the Allstate transaction ranks in third place, behind share sales by
British Petroleum and Time Warner.
The shares being sold by Allstate represent 20 per cent of the insurer's
equity. Sears, based in Chicago, will continue to hold the remaining 80 per
cent. Sears first announced plans to spin off a minority stake in Allstate
last year, as part of its general strategy of pulling out of financial
services and concentrating on its core retail business.
Sears has already sold a 20 per cent stake in Dean Witter, Discover, netting
about Dollars 800m, and announced sale plans for its Coldwell Banker
operations.
Allstate is the second largest writer of homeowners and car insurance
policies in the US, behind State Farm, also based in Illinois. State Farm,
however, remains a 'mutual' company, essentially owned by its policyholders.
Allstate is likely to become the second biggest quoted insurer in the US, in
terms of stock-market capitalisation, behind American International Group.

SEAGRAM, one of the world's top drinks groups, was putting USDollars 2bn
into Time Warner because it 'represents the way the world is going' and
would prove a strong long-term investment, Mr Edgar Bronfman, chairman,
said.
The group had looked in vain for a important beverage investment, Mr
Bronfman told the annual meeting. However, after considering several
alternatives outside beverages, it had bought 5.8 per cent of Time Warner,
the entertainment and multi-media giant.
Seagram will raise this to 15 per cent through market purchases of Time
Warner stock for a total investment of around USDollars 2bn.
'It was my son Edgar's choice and eventually my brother Charles and I came
around. We are fully supportive of Time Warner's new leadership and we feel
management will accept our contribution in future, as did Du Pont a decade
ago,' Mr Bronfman said.
He said his son Edgar would later join the Time Warner board. 'We think Time
Warner has rising and adequate cashflow to handle its debt.'
'Seagram will buy Time Warner stock as the market presents opportunities and
I don't see any need to go any further,' he said.
Mr Bronfman said Seagram had 'no difficulty' with US West, the US
telecommunications company, investing in Time Warner. 'We think (Time
Warner) has tremendous growth potential in the entertainment and
communications fields, and that our choice is the best we could make for all
Seagram shareholders.'
Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, said Seagram was moving aggressively to
capture a bigger share of the North American, European and developing
markets for spirits and wines.
He told the meeting Seagram was concentrating heavily on new brands and
extensions of existing brands. 'We are going after emerging markets where
currencies are stabilising and import restrictions are being lifted,' he
said.
It was aiming at 52m Ukranians, 45m Argentines and Chileans and 1bn Chinese
as future markets, he said.
Seagram reported net profit of USDollars 162m, or 43 cents a share, for the
first quarter ended April 30, up 6 per cent from Dollars 153m, or 41 cents a
share, a year earlier (before accounting changes).
Operating income overall was Dollars 148m, against Dollars 163m. Profit
benefited from lower interest expense and a bigger contribution from its 26
per cent holding in Du Pont, the US chemicals giant.

TELEBRAS, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, is
preparing to raise Dollars 500m in American depositary receipts later this
year.
The company said that before launching the ADRs it would make an unspecified
sum of additional shares available for trading on the US over-the-counter
market. Telebras shares began trading on the over-the-counter market last
year.
The projected Dollars 500m in new equity will probably not be placed on the
market in a single operation, said Mr Joaquim Barao de Assumpcao, assistant
finance director.
The company sent an official statement to the local stock markets to clarify
a report in the financial daily Gazeta Mercantil that made the offering of
Dollars 500m appear imminent.
The ADR operation is awaiting approval by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission which is seeking accounting adjustments to the company's balance
sheet to bring its figures into line with US standards.
Telebras is looking for sources of new capital to fund its investment goal
of Dollars 3.5bn this year. It plans to increase the number of telephone
lines in the country from 10.5m to 11.7m this year, with a goal of 15m by
1995.
If Telebras raises new capital through an ADR operation, it will become the
second Brazilian company to make a new equity placement abroad. In May 1992,
pulp producer Aracruz raised Dollars 132.5m in new equity on the American
market.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Apple's claim on copyright
dismissed

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer's Dollars 5.5bn copyright infringement suit against Microsoft
and Hewlett-Packard was dismissed by a federal judge in San Francisco. The
case was the biggest copyright infringement claim in the history of the
computer industry.
Apple agreed not to contest a motion for dismissal of the case filed by
Microsoft and HP but said it intended to take the case to the appeals court.
In its suit, filed five years ago, Apple charged that Microsoft's 'Windows'
program, which has since become a top seller used on millions of personal
computers, infringes copyrights on Apple's Macintosh programs. Apple also
charged that an HP program, 'New Wave', infringes Macintosh copyrights.
The case has been closely watched because the outcome could have a broad
impact in the computer industry, limiting the publication of 'look-alike'
programs and programs that incorporate features of existing products.
The case was also seen as a threat to the development of easy-to-use
graphical interface programs for IBM-compatible PCs.
However, in a series of interim rulings the court rejected most of Apple's
claims. In particular, the judge dismissed Apple Computer's contention that
the overall 'look and feel' of computer displays should be considered in
determining whether its copyrights were infringed.
Instead, Judge Vaughn Walker compared specific elements of the displays and
ruled that most were not original to Apple or were covered by a prior
licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. Only a handful of display
elements remained in dispute prior to the latest ruling.
Apple said it chose not to contest the Microsoft, HP motion for dismissal of
the case 'in the interests of judicial economy'. Rather than go to trial on
the few remaining issues in the case, Apple plans to reopen the case in the
appeals court.
Microsoft said, however, that having won the case in the trial court it
would 'vigorously defend this result through any appeal'.

TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the leading Swedish insurance group, said yesterday it had
returned to profit in the first four months of this year.
This follows a plunge into heavy losses in 1992 through subsidiaries which
were embroiled in the country's severe banking crisis.
Mr Bjorn Sprangere, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting the
group had shown an operating profit of SKr550m (Dollars 56m) in the first
four months.
It did not report figures for the same period in 1992, but the profit
follows a full-year loss in 1992 of SKr5.2bn.
The bulk of last year's losses were due to the SKr6bn cost of writing down
to zero the value of Trygg's holdings in Gota AB, the holding company for
the collapsed Gotabank, and two collapsed credit insurers, Svenska Kredit
and International Credit.
Mr Sprangere said Trygg was also pulling out of reinsurance activities,
which caused losses last year of several hundred million kroner.
He told shareholders the group was concentrating on its Swedish retail core
business and international industrial insurance, including the profitable
Home Holdings group in the US.
Trygg said its solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders assets to
premiums - now stood at 132 per cent, compared with as low as 110 per cent
at the height of its crisis last year.

distribute in all these key future markets.
Tropicana held just over 3 per cent of the world market for juice beverages,
and it aimed to be the world brand leader, he added.

first quarter ended April 30, up 6 per cent from Dollars 153m, or 41 cents a
share, a year earlier (before accounting changes).
Tropicana and North American spirits and wine operations did well, but the
recession in Europe, Japan and Brazil more than offset this.
Operating income overall was Dollars 148m, against Dollars 163m. Profit
benefited from lower interest expense and a bigger contribution from its 26
per cent holding in Du Pont, the US chemicals giant.
First-quarter beverage sales and other income was Dollars 1.2bn, against
Dollars 1.24bn, and dividend income from Du Pont was Dollars 72m, against
Dollars 69m.

ORKLA, the Norwegian industrial group, is to acquire BOB Industrier, part of
Sweden's ICA Handlarnas group. Analysts said the deal could be worth between
NKr400m and NKr600m (Dollars 59m-Dollars 88m).
The takeover is being made through Nora, Orkla's food products arm. BOB has
sales of SKr700m and pre-tax profits of around SKr40m. Its product areas -
jam, juice, ready-meals and desserts - overlap with parts of Nora's product
range and are sold through ICA retailers.
Nora's sales run at around NKr4bn and 1992 operating profits were NKr304m.
Orkla's 1992 sales totalled NKr16.8bn, of which NKr13bn was accounted for by
sales of branded consumer goods. ICA is Sweden's largest retail-wholesale
group with a 35 per cent domestic market share.
'Nora is a long-term industrial investor which will provide BOB with the
opportunity to further develop its activities . . . in Scandinavia,' said Mr
Roland Fahlin, ICA group chief executive.
Borregaard Industries, another Orkla unit, is to acquire the lignin business
of Finland's Metsa-Serla group. Financial details were not disclosed.
Lignin is derived from sulphite pulp production and is processed into a
wide-range of binding and dispersing agents.
Metsa-Serla's lignin business has annual sales of around NKr60m. The
acquisition will lift Borregaard sales to NKr850m.

DM98m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Metallgesellschaft fell 39 per cent to DM98.3m (Dollars
60.3m) in the six months ended March, in spite of a 17 per cent surge in
sales.
In the light of 'negative' economic conditions, any improvement in the
second half would have to come from continuing cost-cutting programme, the
metals-based conglomerate said yesterday.
The group planned to press ahead with a disposal programme, announced
earlier this year by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, who said he
aimed to raise DM1bn from such sales by the end of 1993-94.
Although the overall half-year result was unsatisfactory, some sectors, such
as engineering services subsidiaries Lurgi and Lentjes, produced markedly
better earnings. On the other hand, the BUS environmental services business
was hit when one of its important customers was driven into bankruptcy.
Turnover in the services businesses, which account for the bulk of group
sales, rose 12 per cent to DM9.3bn.
Together with a 48 per cent improvement in the industrial division's sales
to DM3.3bn, this advance wiped out reductions in raw materials and other
sectors, and pushed the group total up to DM13.9bn.
Performance at Buderus, which specialises in heating, construction products
and special steel, and forms the mainstay of the industrial division,
matched expectations with profits from all businesses except steel.
Dynamit Nobel, acquired along with Buderus early last year when
Metallgesellschaft bought the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel from
Sweden's Stora, suffered especially from weak demand for plastic products
and high-performance ceramics.
Vehicle components maker Kolbenschmidt made a loss in the first half as
rationalisation measures failed to compensate for the downturn in automotive
markets.
Raw materials turned in an unsatisfactory result. Although productivity
improved in German smelting plants, they made significant losses as a result
of weak non-ferrous metals prices and disadvantageous exchange rates.
Investment, which was inflated by acquisitions in the first half of 1992-93
and down 54 per cent to DM1.7bn in the period under review, was focused
mainly on Kolbenschmidt, Dynamit Nobel and above all in the Buderus heating
business.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Accor interested in merger of
Sofitel, Meridien chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotel, catering and tourism group, says it is keen to
merge its luxury Sofitel establishments with the Meridien chain, in which
Air France has a majority stake.
Accor said yesterday that the French government's privatisation programme
and pressure on Air France to dispose of its hotel interests would result in
Meridien needing a private sector partner.
However, Accor said that its current financial state meant it could not
afford to pay for the Meridien hotels. Accor's net profits fell 15.5 per
cent last year to FFr870m (Dollars 159m). Instead, it said, the Sofitel and
Meridien hotels could form part of a new luxury hotel company. Accor said it
did not yet know how much of the merged group it would end up owning, but
added that its preference would be a minority stake of between 35 and 45 per
cent.
Accor owns 85 Sofitel hotels, the majority in Europe. There are 58 Meridien
hotels, mostly outside Europe. Accor said the two chains would complement
each other geographically. As well as their European interests, the merged
group would have a presence in the US, Africa and Asia. It said neither
chain was big enough on its own to compete internationally with the large
hotel groups. A merged hotel company would be sufficiently big to hold its
own, it said.
Sofitel is Accor's most luxurious hotel brand. The group owns a range of
other hotel chains, including Novotel, Ibis and the budget Formule 1 hotels.
In 1991, Accor acquired Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, and added its
Pullman luxury hotels to the Sofitel chain.
Air France yesterday refused to comment on the Accor proposal. It said
others had expressed an interest in the Meridien hotels in the past and that
no decision had yet been taken on the future of the chain. The discussions
with Accor are believed, however, to be at an early stage.

TOTAL, the French oil group, said yesterday that poor economic conditions
continued to weigh heavily on profits, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
It said data for the first four months indicated that 1993 first-half
operating profit would be at or slightly below the FFr3.4bn (Dollars 632.5m)
of the 1992 first half.
The company said exploration and production activities showed comparable
results to 1992. Refining and distribution also showed comparable results,
while refining margins were showing an upward tendency. For 1992, Total's
net profit more than halved to FFr2.85bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISS, the Danish cleaning and building maintenance group, may seek a Wall
Street listing following its Dollars 93.5m acquisition of National Cleaning
of the US.
Mr Poul Andreassen, chief executive, said the acquisition would turn ISS
into one of the biggest foreign employers in the US, with some 50,000 on the
payroll out of ISS' worldwide total of almost 140,000.
ISS is buying National Cleaning from the Nu-Swift group of the UK. It will
merge the group with its existing North American business.
The acquisition will increase group sales in the current year by 15 to 20
per and pre-tax profits by some 10 per cent. Group sales last year totalled
DKr11.35bn (Dollars 1.85bn) and profit was DKr377m.
The purchase is being financed with bank borrowings, which Mr Andreassen
described as 'not expensive' in the US, where bank interest rates stand at 4
per cent.
The reason for considering a New York Stock Exchange listing was to give the
group an American presence in the equity market, Mr Andreassen said. He
added that ISS had no immediate plans to raise new funds on Wall Street.
The group's shares are currently listed in Copenhagen and London. National
Cleaning Group has about 20,000 employees in the US and sales of about
Dollars 490m. The deal, which will take ISS's North American sales to
Dollars 950m, would give the group a leading position in the US cleaning
market and the market for the maintenance of technical installations in
buildings, ISS said.

FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Zurich Insurance forecasts good
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, says it
expects another good overall result this year, with premium growth similar
to last year's 9.9 per cent rise to SFr21.5bn (Dollars 14.60bn).
Mr Rolf Huppi, chief executive, said results in the first half looked good.
He was 'very happy' with Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), the troubled UK
insurer of local authorities, whose ongoing business Zurich acquired in
March.
He said there had been no unpleasant surprises at MMI, and that he was 'very
impressed' with the MMI staff. The challenge was now to integrate the
administration of MMI with that of other Zurich businesses in the UK.
Although the group was interested in making other acquisitions in Europe, Mr
Huppi said there was no hurry. Zurich was already strong in most European
countries, with the exception of Germany. He was confident that prices of
potential acquisitions in that country would drop in the next two years.
Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said the group expected a good
investment result this year after last year's 10.8 per cent rise to
SFr4.10bn. Yields would not rise, but income would grow in line with the
increase in investments.
Last year, bonds and loans accounted for 60.4 per cent of the group's
SFr65.3bn portfolio; equities 14.8 per; real estate 12.3 per cent; mortgages
7.5 per cent; and short-term investments 3.4 per cent.
The group's policy this year was to expand investment in equities,
particularly in countries where these do not yet represent 15 per cent of
the portfolio.
'For fixed interest rate investments, we will tend to select shorter
maturities in US dollars and related currencies, although we still prefer
longer terms in Europe,' Mr Hanggi said.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cupid falls into red and omits dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH TRADING in the marriage market and high costs pushed Cupid, the
USM-quoted bridal wear company, into losses in the year to end-March. The
dividend has been passed.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.48m compared with profits of Pounds 867,000.
Last year the group paid a dividend of 3.25p.
Cupid, which grew rapidly through acquisition in the 1990s and has suffered
from high costs and heavy borrowings, yesterday expressed optimism for the
current year.
The company said: 'Trading in the first month of the current year has been
in line with the new management's expectations. The benefits of cost cutting
are becoming evident and the board remains confident of a satisfactory
outcome in the current year.'
Cupid's shares closed down 1p to 27p yesterday. The stock, which traded as
high as 143p in July 1989, had slumped after a profits warning in December
1992 which was accompanied by the resig-nation of the company's founders, Mr
Michael Murray and his wife, Sue.
In February a Pounds 600,000 net share subscription, organised by the
company's new chairman, Mr Richard Shaw, reduced gearing from more than 100
per cent to 74 per cent. Gearing fell further, to 42 per cent, with the
Pounds 1.2m net proceeds of a rights issue, the third in little more than
two years, received in early April.
Turnover improved to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.7m) reflecting the first
full-year contribution of the Youngs mens wear chain, acquired in January
last year.
The company, which has adopted the new FRS 3 accounting standard, took
exceptional charges of Pounds 663,000 (Pounds 115,000) including Pounds
188,000 in compensation for four directors' loss of office, and a
reorganisation of its nursery and retail divisions.
Interest and similar charges amounted to Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 364,000).
Losses per share were 10.5p (earnings 7.4p).

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lower Lloyd's income cuts Sturge to Pounds
0.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in fee income from its Lloyd's agencies cut interim pre-tax
profits at Sturge Holdings from Pounds 2.58m to Pounds 325,000 in the six
months to March 31.
The fall in fee income was due to a reduction in the amount of insurance
capacity managed by Sturge in 1993 and was only partially compensated for by
a rise in income at Wise Speke, the stockbroking subsidiary.
Fee and commission income from insurance fell to Pounds 7.77m (Pounds
7.85m), producing operating losses of Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 813,000 profit).
Income from stockbroking rose to Pounds 6.33m (Pounds 4.36m), leaving an
operating profit of Pounds 951,000 (Pounds 11,000).
Expenses, however, jumped to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 11.4m), reflecting the
inclusion of start-up costs for Sturge's run-off subsidiary and new European
operations, as well as higher expenditure by Wise Speke.
Operating losses of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 802,000 profit) were offset by a
fall in interest and other income to Pounds 1.36m against Pounds 1.78m.
Earnings per share fell to 0.4p (3.4p) and a reduced dividend of 1p (2.75p)
was declared.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman, said the group's fortunes reflected the
problems of the insurance market, describing recent underwriting losses as
'truly horrific.'
Nevertheless, 11 of Sturge's 22 syndicates reported profits in the 1990 year
of account, despite projected losses for the market as a whole of between
Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 2.8bn.
Profit commission, expected to amount to about Pounds 4m in the second half,
will be reflected in the full-year results.
Overall, Sturge's syndicates will still lose an amount equivalent to 21 per
cent of their stamp capacity, said Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive.

A significant contribution from its homecare operations helped Kleeneze
increase overall pre-tax profits by 80 per cent in the first half.
In an active period, characterised by disposals and acquisitions, this
distributor of consumer products achieved turnover of Pounds 29.2m (Pounds

336,000).
However, the share price yesterday fell by 16p to 164p.
In November 1992, the company acquired 50 per cent of Hawkshead Countrywear.
A Pounds 107,000 loss was carried from that business since its acquisition.
The comparative figures for 1992 have been restated to reflect the new
accounting treatment under FRS 3.
Earnings per share came through at 3.17p against 2.12p.

110m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baring Chrysalis, a London-listed investment company specialising in
emerging markets, is seeking to raise Dollars 110m (Pounds 71.4m) via an
issue of new shares.
About Dollars 60m is being raised via a placing of 12m C shares at Dollars 5
each, with a further 10m shares being offered to existing holders at the
same price.
The C shares will eventually be converted into ordinary shares.
The rationale for issuing a separate class of shares is twofold; the new
shareholders will bear the costs of the issue; the trust's investment
performance will not be distorted by market movements before the new money
is fully invested.
Baring Chrysalis, which was established in December 1990, is a Cayman Island
registered fund, and not an authorised investment trust.
It currently has assets of about Dollars 140m.

BARCOM, the civil engineering and plant hire concern, reported pre-tax

end-March.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 76,000 on sales of Pounds 1.44m -

Mr John Pinckard, chairman, said the acquisition of the Hawkins plant hire
business in February had been satisfactorily completed. It had now been

The acquisition had increased group borrowings substantially. At the period
end they had risen by Pounds 18m resulting in gearing of 164 per cent, Mr
Pinckard said.
The interest charge increased from Pounds 193,000 to Pounds 420,000.
An interim dividend of 1.25p (nil) is declared, payable from earnings per

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Slimmed-down creature keeps up guard - The
continuing rehabilitation of Cannon Street Investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the recent standards of Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate
trying to reinvent itself, the chairman's message to the annual meeting
yesterday was upbeat.
'Our portfolio of businesses is still too large . . . There are thus a
number of subsidiaries that do not have a long-term future . . . But they
are under control and none of them are disasters waiting to happen . . . It
is of course, rather early in the rehabilitation process to guarantee a
bright future,' Mr Tom Long told shareholders.
The priority of the new management, led by Mr Long, a former BAT director
who became Cannon Street's chairman a year ago, has been to stabilise the
group and end its cash drain.
They have sold many of its disparate businesses and now face the task of
building a new group from the less-than-promising remains.
In the past two months the market value of Cannon Street has responded to
this treatment, more than quadrupling to over Pounds 30m as the share price
has jumped from a low of 7 3/4 p to 30p - despite a Pounds 115m loss last
year.
Although this is only a fraction of Cannon Street's Pounds 250m market
capitalisation during its heyday in the 1980s, it is perhaps an indication
of investor confidence that its results can only get better.
Bank borrowings have fallen from Pounds 75.9m at the start of 1992 to Pounds
29.6m at the beginning of January and now stand at about Pounds 16m.
This excludes Pounds 25m of preference stock mostly held by the Bank of
Scotland, the group's principal banker, which could, at some stage, be
converted into equity.
Meanwhile, Cannon's raggedy portfolio of more than 50 subsidiaries has been
pruned to just over 20 - almost all of which are now profitable at the
operating level.
But there have been penalties. Last year's pre-tax loss came after Pounds
57.4m of goodwill write-offs and Pounds 42.5m of losses on sales and
disposals - the result of a 'kitchen sink' accounting exercise undertaken by
Mr David Smith, the group's recently appointed chief executive, who led
Isosceles' heavily indebted buy-out of the Gateway supermarket chain.
The impact of these moves was felt not only by shareholders in their
pockets, because the ordinary dividend has been suspended, but also in the
shrunken balance sheet where shareholders' funds were reduced to Pounds
17.8m.
Mr Smith joined Cannon Street's board last September and succeeded Mr Robin
Binks as chief executive in March - Mr Binks, it has since emerged, received
a 'termination settlement' of Pounds 366,100.
Under Mr Binks and now Mr Smith, the aggressive acquisition policy of the
1980s, which had made the group virtually unmanageable and left it with
gearing of 400 per cent, has been reversed.
Last year alone the group realised more than Pounds 60m from disposals,
including Pounds 42m from the flotation of Avonside, the housebuilder.
Virtually all of the building and building services operations were sold or
closed down.
The priority, according to Mr Long, was to preserve operating cash flows,
and withdraw from operations requiring significant cash input.
What is left are three main divisions: hotels and leisure, electronics
distribution and food and drink distribution with annual sales of about
Pounds 170m. In addition there are a handful of businesses which do not fit
into any of the three broad divisions and which will probably be sold.
Mr Smith believes the best prospects lie in the hotel and leisure division
and the electronics distribution businesses.
The hotel and leisure operations, with annual turnover of about Pounds 35m,
comprise three hotels in Scotland, including the four-star Cameron House
resort hotel at Loch Lomond, timeshare operations and Cotswold Travel, a
tour operator which trades as Four Winds.
The electronics distributions businesses include Altai, which imports a wide
range of electronic equipment from the Far East and Network Group Holdings,
which designs electrical products like fridges, freezers and televisions,
for manufacture in eastern Europe, pays for them with barter agreements and
then re-imports the goods to western Europe.
Dunnet, a Netherlands-based company, mostly trades computer manufacturers'
surplus stock. Altogether the division has sales of about Pounds 100m.
Although there have been a few management changes, the board plans to review
how the remaining operations are performing at the interim stage. 'For the
moment we are just looking to see how much they can produce themselves,'
said Mr Smith.
However much tighter financial controls have already been installed and Mr
Smith said most of the businesses were working with real budgets for the
first time and the group now had a single auditor across all of its
subsidiar-ies.
Last year the group posted a loss from continuing operations of Pounds
7.45m, reflecting the recession and particularly poor performances by some
operating subsidiaries, including Cannon Material Handling, a fork lift
truck distributor and lessor which is the only remaining cash drain.
Nevertheless, Cannon Street is now cash-positive, and Mr Long, predicts,
will return to profits this year.
The real question is just how much profit can be squeezed out of the
remaining business portfolio.
Mr Robert Gibson, an analyst with Robert Fleming, is impressed with the new
management so far.
'They have overhauled the balance sheet and seem to have turned the group
around.' Though he acknowledges that these are early days and 'there is
still a certain amount one has to take on trust.'
That trust has probably been enhanced by Mr Long's recent purchase of a
small stake in the group. In total he now holds 97,000 shares, although Mr
Smith has yet to make a similar move.
Mr Gibson believes it will not be too difficult for Cannon Street to achieve
modest pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 4m this year.
Further on, he suggests pre-tax profits might be boosted to about Pounds
12.5m, but he believes this is probably also 'the potential and the limit,'
because of the quality of the businesses, and the relatively low margins
they are likely to generate.
'They are not really futuristic businesses that will take them through the
90s,' he says.
To paraphrase the old joke, if you want to build a high-flying
mini-conglomerate you probably would not start here.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ICD sells 75% stake in Database to
management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the USM-quoted provider of direct
marketing data, is disposing of 75.1 per cent of its interest in lossmaking
The Database Group, to existing management and financial backers.
ICD, which has changed its year end to May 31, also announced a pre-tax loss
of Pounds 491,000 for the 12 months to February 28 against profits of Pounds
1.14m.
The result includes losses of Pounds 415,000 from TDG and Pounds 1.05m of
exceptional charges. Turnover was Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 9.6m).
Mr David Cicurel, chairman, said that the three months to May were a period
of low seasonal activity which usually traded at a loss.
The results for the 15 months would therefore include such losses as well as
provisions in respect of group properties and the effect of a new accounting
policy to record the value of the databases.
TDG, which comprises the businesses of Lindor and Compass and the consulting
arm of ICD, is being sold for cash to Quayshelfco 430, formed for the
purpose of the acquisition by Mr Les O'Reilly, who will resign as a director
of ICD on completion of the sale.
The disposal, which will allow significant head office economies, should
restore profitability, Mr Cicurel said.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US clarifies trading of Zeneca during
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exch-ange Commission has clarified the trading rules
for underwriters of the Zeneca Pounds 1.3bn rights issue.
Since shares of Zeneca, the bioscience business demerged this week from
Imperial Chemical Industries, are to be listed in New York as well as
London, the SEC's rules have to be complied with.
However, whereas normally there are restrictions on underwriters throughout
such an offer period, the restrictions on Zeneca's underwriters will only
cover the last five days up to the close on June 21.
Underwriters will be able to trade normally if the Zeneca share price is
either below the 600p rights issue price or more than 666p. Yesterday the
shares closed at 634p, up 4p.
If the share price is between 600p and 666p, underwriters can only trade
'passively' the SEC says. This means they can respond to client orders and
deal at the market price. But they cannot generate trades or 'lead' the
market.
Meanwhile, shares in new-ICI, rose further yesterday, up 38p to 674p.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Birkdale placing and offer to raise Pounds
1.95m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRKDALE Group, which is involved in advertising, public relations and
marketing, is raising about Pounds 1.95m net through the placing of 21.78m
new ordinary shares at 10p.
The shares have been conditionally placed subject to an open offer to
shareholders by Apax Partners on the basis of 11-for-9. The proceeds will be
used to reduced indebtedness and provide additional working capital to
enable the group to continue trading.
The group's shares fell 28 per cent yesterday, from 25p to 18p.
Following the placing and offer, the company proposes to subdivide each
existing share into one new ordinary with a nominal value of 5p and one
deferred share with a nominal value of 20p, which the company proposes to
buy back and cancel.
Birkdale has also entered agreements with Stax Investments International as
a development partner for Thanestead Farm near High Wycombe in
Buckinghamshire.
An extraordinary meeting is being held on June 25 to consider the proposals.
Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on June 28.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Vosper improves to Pounds 19m - Order book
exceeds Pounds 700m of which 95% will go overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG export perform-ance helped Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the
shipbuilding and engineering group, sail through the gloom which has gripped
other defence contractors.
The Southampton-based company yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 19m in the year to March 31. Sales rose by 25 per
cent to Pounds 196m.
Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the group's order book remained in excess of
Pounds 700m, of which 95 per cent will go overseas - mainly to the Middle
and Far East.
Vosper Thornycroft is currently making no plastic-hulled minehunters, but
hopes soon to receive funding for another three from Saudi Arabia, and a
further batch from the Royal Navy. It has also tendered to build six
minehunters for both Australia and Turkey.
Mr Martin Jay, managing director, said work on new steel ship orders for
Oman, Quatar and the UK's Customs and Excise was progressing well.
The policy of broadening the group's business base into related field
continued, with non-defence order input up from Pounds 14m in 1992 to Pounds
16m in 1993.
Cash balances stood at Pounds 90m at the year-end, of which about Pounds 50m
could be used for acquisitions. Mr Jay said he wanted to take a measured
approach, making acquisitions in areas which were related to the core
business.
Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to 41.3p (34.8p).
A final dividend of 11.1p (9p) gives a total for the year of 15.8p (13.1p),
an increase of 21 per cent. The company said it had increased the dividend
by this exceptional amount so as to compensate institutional shareholders
for the reduction in the rate of Advance Corporation Tax.
COMMENT
These results caused Vosper Thornycroft's shares to close 22p higher at 595p
yesterday - completing a striking rerating from their level of 240p of March
last year. It has taken the market some time to realise that not all defence
companies deserve to be in the dog house - and Vosper Thornycroft's strong
overseas order book continues to impress. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds
20m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.8, a slight discount to
the market. However, in spite of the dividend rise, the prospective yield of
3.5 per cent is substantially below the market average. The shares are
likely to take a breather, at least until there are more firm orders from
the Royal Navy or Saudi Arabia.
