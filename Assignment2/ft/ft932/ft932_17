FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis Pounds 2.83m back in profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the hotels and casinos group, continued its recovery in the first
half and achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m.
That compared with a Pounds 3.39m loss previously, restated in accordance
with the FRS 3 accounting standard.
It has restored payment of an interim dividend with 0.45p for the six months
to April 4. Earnings per share were 0.84p against losses of 1.24p.
Mr David Michels, chief executive, said the Glasgow-based company's improved
performance was due largely to its own efforts at improving margins and
controlling costs, rather than to increased demand. 'We've not seen any
green shoots at all in hotels, though turnover in casinos is up slightly,'
he said.
Stakis, which was subject to a rescue led by Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman,
in 1991 after ill-judged expansion, recently sold its nursing homes division
for Pounds 50m to a syndicate led by Electra, making an extraordinary loss
of Pounds 47.7m. It also raised Pounds 28m in a rights issue. It now
concentrates on hotels and casinos.
The hotels division improved its operating profit by 35 per cent to Pounds
8.1m (Pounds 6m) thanks mainly to better margins and higher occupancy
levels.
Casinos' operating profits increased from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 5.4m, due to
improved trading following the group's decision to keep the activity as a
core business. The Scottish casinos maintained the previous year's
performance, while those in England improved.
Turnover on continuing operations was Pounds 64.8m in the 27-week period
(Pounds 62.3m in 26 weeks).
Sir Lewis Robertson said: 'It's a recovery in the sense that there is no
illness now, and there is more to come as the economy improves. It's been a
team effort working on fundamentally good material.'
COMMENT
The arcane debate about whether Stakis is off the sick list ought now to be
concluded in the affirmative. It is a much smaller company than it was, but
the two divisions which remain are sound and the management gives a
comforting impression that, unlike its predecessor, it is not likely to do
anything stupid. The fact that it made yesterday's profits without seeing
any green shoots is austerely encouraging, and they reflected only a few
weeks of the reduced interest payments that followed the disposal and rights
issue. What happens next depends partly on how provincial hotels perform
this summer. The market is looking for full-year profits of about Pounds 9m
for a p/e of 17. But potential profits of Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m in 1993-94
are not yet fully in the share price unchanged yesterday at 55p.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Group advances 24% to Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST charges helped Anglian Group, the double glazing company
which came to the market last year, announce a 24 per cent jump in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 23.1m.
Operating profits, struck on sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 151.4m, were
only marginally ahead from Pounds 23m to Pounds 23.2m for the 53 weeks to
April 3. However, the pre-tax return was helped by a Pounds 4.5m drop in
interest charges to Pounds 1.2m. The results compare with the 52 weeks to
March 28 1992.
Mr Bill Hancock, chief executive, said he was reasonably pleased with the
improvement in sales and profit given the tough conditions in the market.
The company estimated that the overall UK market had declined by about 10
per cent in the past year.
Mr Hancock said the group had experienced particularly tough trading
following the devaluation of sterling and withdrawal from the exchange rate
mechanism.
However, consumer confidence appeared to have picked up in the final
quarter. The overall order book had risen by about Pounds 5m from the start
of the year to Pounds 35m on the back of stronger retail interest.
The commercial division, which performed largely public sector work, had a
slightly lower order book than last year. However, it now comprised about 15
per cent of sales, against 10 per cent. The larger proportion of public
sector work was partly responsible for a decline in margins from 15.8 per
cent to 15.3 per cent.
Mr Hancock said the group expected benefits in the current year from the
Pounds 8.5m purchase in March of New England Windows, which supplies local
authorities in England and Wales.
On a pro forma basis, which assumes that the capital reorganisation and
share issue at the flotation had been in place for the last financial year,
Anglian showed a 6 per cent advance to Pounds 24.2m pre-tax.
The proposed final dividend of 5.8p makes 9.5p for the year. This compares
with a notional pay-out of 8.7p on a pro forma basis. Earnings fell from
18.9p to 18.7p per share, based on the pre-flotation share structure.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Price increases behind rise at Thames Water
 -Restructuring costs total Pounds 8.5m as 400 jobs are shed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES WATER, the largest of the privatised water companies, yesterday
announced a 6 per cent profits increase for the year ended March 31 1993,
thanks to a strong performance from its regulated business.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 236.3m to Pounds 251.3m mainly because
of average price rises of 9 per cent. At the interim stage, profits were 5
per cent higher at Pounds 124m.
Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said the results were
'satisfactory given the recession, not only in the UK but also in our
overseas markets'.
Turnover for the 12 months increased from Pounds 899m to Pounds 1.04bn,
lifted by sales from acquisitions which contributed Pounds 76.6m. The
regulated business reported turnover up 7.4 per cent at Pounds 810m and was
affected by reduced measured usage.
There were restructuring costs of Pounds 8.5m as staff numbers were cut by
400 to 6,800. Operating costs increased 16 per cent to Pounds 769.2m.
Thames's unregulated businesses, which include process engineering companies
PWT Worldwide and Utag, reported disappointing pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.8m on sales of Pounds 234.4m.
About Pounds 3.1m of profits, however, stemmed from treasury operations and
several of the operating companies announced losses. Brophy, an associate
involved in environmental services, suffered losses totalling Pounds 2m but
this has been restructured.
A planned dam and pipeline project in Turkey has been delayed, but Mr Mike
Hoffman, group chief executive, said he remained hopeful the project would
be signed this year.
Interest costs increased from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 30.8m as net borrowings
increased nearly Pounds 200m to Pounds 518m in line with the company's
capital expenditure programme. Gearing increased from 21 per cent to 31 per
cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.69bn.
Earnings per share increased 8.2 per cent to 59.3p (54.8p) helped by a lower
advance corporation tax charge following the budget changes.
The company recommended a final dividend of 14.1p to make a total of 21p, a
9 per cent increase. It decided against offering an enhanced scrip dividend
alternative after sounding out some of its larger shareholders.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Inveresk shares rise 15% in first day's
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scottish paper maker, closed at a near 15 per cent premium in
its first day's trading on the Stock Exchange yesterday, writes James
Buxton.
The shares, priced at 150p, closed at 172p, having touched 177p.
Some 5.5m shares were traded, out of the 22.6m issued in the placing and
intermediaries offer, which was 6.6 times subscribed.
Selling was mostly on behalf of private investors unwinding holdings after
being disappointed by the size of their allocations, which were severely
scaled down.
James Capel, broker to the offer, said that the premium was fair and the
company was happy with it.
Though not as high as some recent first day premiums, it was at a level
needed to build a good shareholder base, James Capel added.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Warburg chief takes Pounds 0.8m pay
reduction
</HEADLINE>

   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, saw his pay package tumble by
Pounds 787,000 for the year ended March 31 1993.
The UK merchant bank sliced his pay from Pounds 1.2m leaving him with a
package totalling Pounds 411,000, with no long-term performance related
payments.
Group profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 148m, despite a strong recovery in
the second half.
Sir David's pay included an annual performance-related payment down from
Pounds 316,000 to Pounds 216,000, but there was no long-term performance
related bonus, which had accounted for more than half his remuneration
package the previous year.
His basic salary was unchanged at Pounds 195,000, according to the annual
report. Long - term performance related pay is set by a compensation
committee.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: British Land 3.9% ahead as property values
pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WELL as announcing the Pounds 500m property buying partnership and a
Pounds 132m rights issue yesterday, British Land reported a 3.9 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34.6m for the year to end-March, writes
Maggie Urry.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said that 'the signs of recovery which I
signalled a year ago are now more widely discernible'. He said that since
the recession began, the group had bought Pounds 900m of properties and
those were now valued at Pounds 109m over purchase price.
A final dividend of 4.72p (4.28p) is proposed to give a total of 7p (6.35p),
a rise of 10.2 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 6.4 per cent
to 13.3p.
The fall in the value of the group's properties over the year was 3.3 per
cent, a smaller drop than the 10.5 per cent and 9.6 per cent of the two
previous years. During the year the group bought Pounds 166m of properties
and sold Pounds 113m. Net assets per share fell from 326p to 307p.
Gross rental income rose by 15.3 per cent to Pounds 146.6m, a feature being
the rent review at the Euston Tower, and operating income was up 18.3 per
cent to Pounds 125.5m. There was a Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 6.3m) profit on
property trading.
However, the interest charge rose from Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 93.2m. Mr John
Weston Smith, finance director, said that the debt/equity ratio had been
reduced. Year-end net debt was Pounds 882m and shareholders funds were
Pounds 718.4m (Pounds 763.8m).
The group had exercised its right to convert its Pounds 115m convertible
bonds into convertible preference shares and had issued a Pounds 200m,
35-year debenture. The group also has over Pounds 600m of bank facilities.
The group's debt now has an average maturity of 19 years at an average cost
of 9.58 per cent.
Mr Weston Smith said that there had been a slight increase in the proportion
of voids in the portfolio to 3 per cent, but that 50 per cent of the group's
properties were occupied either by government agencies or FT-SE 100
companies.
The UK office portfolio had fallen in value by 12.2 per cent, but within
that City of London offices had fallen by 11.4 per cent compared with a 31
per cent drop the previous year.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Questions asked about Ritblat share
purchase - Institutions concerned about a conflict of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL investors in British Land were yesterday asking questions
about the deal secured by Mr John Ritblat, chairman, to buy shares at 298p
while the market price jumped 46p yesterday to 344p.
More fundamentally, they were concerned that the partnership deal with Mr
George Soros's Quantum group could cause a conflict for British Land's
management, trying to serve both its own shareholders and the partnership.
The subject is fraught since in 1989 institutional investors stopped British
Land from spinning off most of its properties into a new company. The deal
included management incentive targets which shareholders considered too
easy.
As part of yesterday's deal setting up the partnership which will invest
Pounds 500m in property, Quantum is to buy 11.3m new shares at 298p each,
the closing share price on Tuesday. However, Quantum is buying the shares ex
the final 4.72p dividend and ex the 4-for-17 rights issue at 245p which
British Land also announced yesterday.
Mr Ritblat is buying 2m shares personally, of which 538,383 will come from
taking up the rights on his existing holding. At least another 1m shares and
up to all the remainder of the 2m will be bought from Quantum at the 298p
price. This will take his total holding to 4.29m shares.
It was also revealed yesterday that Mr Ritblat's salary rose by 7.9 per cent
last year to Pounds 336,300.
On the face of it, the share deal gives Mr Ritblat a rapid profit. However,
advisers to British Land said that under the terms of the agreement with Mr
Soros, Mr Ritblat had to retain 4m shares for a year, so he could not
realise yesterday's profit. Further, he is required to hold 2m shares until
the end of the partnerships 'acquisition period' at the end of 1997.
An incentive for British Land management in the form of options over another
4m of the Quantum shares, again at 298p, cannot be exercised until 2003, and
only then if certain performance criteria are met.
British Land said Mr Soros had insisted that Mr Ritblat put his own money
into British Land shares. Rather than viewing the agreement as a way for Mr
Ritblat to buy shares cheaply, they were seen as the 'stick' part of a
'carrot and stick' arrangement.
Since the shares to satisfy the management options would come from Quantum
rather than from the company the incentive scheme was not dilutive for
shareholders.
As for potential conflicts, British Land said that what was good for the
partnership would be good for its own shareholders.
Unlike the 1989 deal, which was defeated at a shareholder vote, yesterday's
proposal is not subject to shareholder approval.

FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Fears grow over Alpine pensions - Double
glazing company's silence a worry for employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS HAVE been expressed over the fate of pension payments made over the
last 15 months by employees of Alpine (Double Glazing), which informed staff
by post on Saturday that it had ceased trading.
The Department of Trade and Industry is also believed to have had meetings
with former employees over events at the company. The DTI refused to comment
yesterday.
Repeated enquiries over several months regarding the pension payments -
estimated to total about Pounds 100,000 - have failed to elicit a response
from the management. Alpine, once owned by ADT, was purchased from
administrators in February 1992 by a group backed by Midlands entrepreneur
Mr Clive Smith.
At the time of the purchase, the new management sought to effect a transfer
of pension payments up to February 1992 from the ADT fund to the new
company. The ADT trustees refused, however, as Alpine did not present an
approved plan. As recently as December 1992, Alpine was unable to present an
approved pension plan.
However, the company continued to deduct pension payments from employees'
salaries. Discussions with Allied Dunbar on setting up a pension plan were
never followed through.
One former employee said yesterday that the company had deducted Pounds
2,500 in pension payments from his salary since February 1992. The
management has so far failed to respond to queries from either the employee
or his solicitor. Calls to the head office and messages left with the senior
management went unanswered.
It became clear yesterday that Alpine has been in difficulties for some
time. Many employees have not been paid for up to three months, while bills
for advertising and services have also been left unpaid. On Friday Mr Robin
Speirs, chief executive, gave notice on behalf of the board of a meeting of
creditors to be held on June 15 which would decide whether Alpine should be
liquidated.
Alpine was once one of the best known names in the double glazing industry.
In a recent attempt to revive the company, Alpine produced a glossy brochure
entitled Nightmare on Life Street setting out its latest products including
a window with a burglar alarm.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Sales plans by US drugs group set back by committee reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNTEX, the Californian-based drugs group, was told yesterday by two US Food
and Drug Administration committees they could not recommend that Naprosyn,
the company's best-selling prescription product, be switched to
over-the-counter status.
The decision shows that the switch of products from prescription status to
OTC being attempted by many companies is far from automatic.
Mr Jonathan Gelles, pharmaceuticals analyst at Wertheim Schroder, the
New-York based brokers, suggested the market had not absorbed the
implications for SmithKline Beecham and Merck &amp; Co, which are trying to
switch the anti-ulcer treatments Tagamet and Pepcid.
The decision is a severe blow for Syntex, which had hoped to counter the
expiry of Naprosyn's US patents in December by selling the medicine
over-the-counter (OTC) at pharmacies without a prescription.
On Wall Street, Syntex's shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 19 1/8
.
The committees' recommendations, whose advice is nearly always accepted by
the FDA, are also a setback to Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer group and the
US's largest OTC company, which formed a marketing alliance with Syntex in
1987.
Mr Gelles said American sales of Syntex's Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory
medicine used to treat arthritis, were Dollars 759m (Pounds 492m),
equivalent to 42 per cent of the group's worldwide drugs sales.
He estimated Naprosyn generated more than 75 per cent of group profits last
year.
Recent US patent expiries have resulted in sales falling more than 50 per
cent during the first year, as cheap generic equivalents gain market share.
Committee members expressed concern about the safety of the product and the
high level of dosing proposed by Syntex.
The product has been available OTC in Australia for a decade.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Siebe cost-cutting puts profits up by 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRIVE to cut costs enabled Siebe, the UK-based international engineering
systems and controls group, to increase profits in spite of continuing
recession in nearly all of its main markets.
Pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent to Pounds 185.1m for the year to April 3,
although sales were nearly 1 per cent lower at Pounds 1.62bn. Net cash flow
increased by Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 95.2m and gearing, excluding finance
leases, fell from 78.8 to 60.4 per cent.
Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said the group was well on course to reduce
the gearing percentage to the mid-50s by the autumn - a commitment made to
shareholders when the group bought Foxboro, the US controls business, in
1990.
Mr Stephens said: 'Market shares have increased in all four core businesses.
Each division launched a significant number of successful new products
during the year.
'These excellent results also reflect our rigorous management of working
capital and cash flow and emphasise the powerful position from which we
shall grow and enhance our shareholders' value as economic conditions surely
improve.'
The group said the final quarter of the period confirmed indications of an
improvement in the US and UK. It also believed that Japanese markets would
recover within the next 18 months.
Mr Stephens said: 'These encouraging indications, together with Siebe's
significantly stronger order book and and strong balance sheet, with cash of
Pounds 205m, leads the group to look forward with confidence to the future.'
Siebe increased its net trading margins across the group from 10.4 to 11.4
per cent. with all segments showing improvement. Productivity increased,
with manning reduced by 6.1 per cent, or 1,932 employees.
Sales volumes were down 4.3 per cent in constant currency terms. Overseas
business accounted for 91.5 per cent of group sales and 89.2 per cent of
group profits.
Group spending on research and development was Pounds 65.5m, or 4 per cent
of turnover, which was taken through the profit and loss account.
A further Pounds 23m of spending on software was capitalised as intangible
assets, although that was less than the equivalent depreciation charge of
Pounds 31m.
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 27.2p from 23.8p. A final dividend
of 6.6725p gives a total for the year of 10p, against 9.075p, a rise of 10.2
per cent, which is covered 2.7 times.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Yorkshire Water raises Pounds 60m through convertible bond
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Water, the Leeds- based water and sewerage company, yesterday
raised Pounds 60.4m through a senior convertible bond issue, which the
company said could be used to fund either its regulated or non-core
business.
All water companies are assessing their funding needs as borrowings mount
because of heavy capital expenditure programmes. Last week North West Water,
another of the 10 privatised companies, announced it was saving Pounds 60m
to invest in its non-core business through an enhanced scrip dividend
alternative.
Yorkshire and Thames Water, both of which announced final results yesterday,
said they had decided against offering enhanced scrip schemes.
Yorkshire's pre-tax profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 123.9m to
Pounds 138.6m in the year to March 31. Profits were lifted by a Pounds 4.4m
gain on the establishment of a joint venture water engineering company.
Turnover increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 481.6m due to average price
increases of 7 per cent. Squeezed operating costs led to a 19 per cent rise
in operating profits of Pounds 148.8m.
The company's unregulated businesses, including clinical waste disposal and
environmental services, made operating profits of Pounds 2.6m, including
property profits of Pounds 1m. Mr Malcolm Batty, finance director, said that
the division broke even after financing costs.
The interest bill increased sharply from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 13.6m. The
company's capital expenditure programme meant net debt rose from Pounds 140m
to Pounds 216m, while gearing went up from 13 per cent to 18 per cent.
Capital expenditure on Yorkshire's regulated business was stable at Pounds
303m, while spending on the non-core nearly doubled to Pounds 20m.
Earnings increased 13 per cent to 65p. Adjusting for the one-off profit from
the joint venture, earnings increased 9 per cent. The company recommended a
final dividend of 14.2p to make a total of 21.25p, a rise of 9 per cent.
The convertible had a maturity of 15 years and a coupon of 6.75 per cent.
Baring Brothers, acting as arranger, said demand was strong and the bonds
were placed in Europe, especially among Swiss investors.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Blenheim falls after Pounds 75m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLENHEIM Group, the acquisitive exhibition organiser, yesterday launched a
Pounds 75.8m convertible preference share issue and said the money raised
would be used to finance acquisitions in the US and continental Europe.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said the issue would allow Blenheim to expand
without interest cover falling below the company's self-imposed floor of
seven times: 'America is coming out of recession and there are going to be
opportunities to buy,' he said.
But the issue was poorly received on the stock market, where Blenheim's
shares fell 29p to 513p, a low for the year, after touching 493p on low
volume.
Following a switch in Blenheim's financial year end and other accounting
changes, there is concern about the quality of the company's underlying
earnings. Yesterday's issue and the planned expansion will further cloud
analysts' forecasts.
The share price fall also reflected an effective 1994 profits downgrade from
Blenheim's house broker, BZW. The broker had forecast profits of Pounds 54m
but reduced the estimate to Pounds 49m to reflect a slowdown in Europe.
After yesterday's share issue, and an assumed return on the money raised,
the forecast has been restored to Pounds 55m.
Under the terms of the issue, Blenheim is issuing 75.8m, 6.4 per cent
convertible cumulative preference shares with a conversion price of 610p.
Shareholders can subscribe at the issue price of 100p on the basis of nine
preference shares for every 11 ordinary shares held.
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Blenheim's largest shareholder with 14 per
cent, will subscribe for half its entitlement while the company's directors,
who hold 27 per cent, will not subscribe. Mr Buch said the issue was
structured like this, rather than a conventional issue, to attract
continental European investors. BZW, Robert Fleming and Credit Lyonnais
underwrote the placing.
Blenheim also said the board expects to announce dividends this year of no
less than 10.25p, an increase of about 14 per cent. Blenheim has net
borrowings of Pounds 58m, most in the form of 8.69 per cent senior notes due
1999. Money raised from the issue will be held on deposit until acquisitions
are made.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Scientists hot on the trail of elusive flu virus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENCE may at last have outwitted the fast-changing influenza virus.
Researchers at Monash University in Australia have designed a promising
anti-flu drug that is now being developed by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceutical
group.
First details of the drug, known by the code name GR121167X, are published
today in the research journal Nature. Laboratory tests in cell cultures and
on ferrets show that it has 'potent anti-influenza activity' against
different strains of the virus.
Human volunteers are expected to begin taking GR121167X - as a nasal spray -
within a year. Clinical trials would then last three to five years before
Glaxo could seek regulatory approval for the drug.
Influenza is one of the world's most serious infectious diseases, laying low
millions of people and killing many thousands even in a non-epidemic year.
The virus's extraordinary variability and speed of mutation are matched only
by the Aids virus, HIV.
This has so far prevented scientists developing a general-purpose flu drug.
Flu vaccines are limited in their effectiveness and a different cocktail has
to be injected every year, depending on which strains are prevalent.
The Australian researchers tackled the problem by identifying an enzyme on
the surface of the virus which does not vary between different strains. They
then used computer modelling to design a drug that would fit into the enzyme
molecule and stop it working.
Other companies are investigating anti-flu drugs. Wellcome of the UK has an
experimental compound aimed at a different enzyme, which would be taken by
mouth. But Dr Garry Taylor, a Bath University biochemist, says GR121167X
seems to be the most promising so far, 'though it is possible that
drug-resistant forms of the virus could arise during the clinical trials'.
At the same time, vaccine manufacturers such as Merieux of France are
working to develop longer-lasting and more effective flu jabs.
Everyone's aim, says Dr Taylor, is to have an effective treatment ready when
the next great pandemic strain of flu emerges. The Australian research
suggests that science may get there in time.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Patten's attack angers head teachers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RIFT between the government and the teaching profession deepened
yesterday after Mr John Patten, the education secretary, accused head
teachers of 'turning back the clock to an educational dark age'.
Mr Patten's speech to the annual conference of the National Association of
Head Teachers in Newcastle upon Tyne met with a fiercely hostile reaction,
punctuated by hisses, jeers and shouts of 'rubbish'. Mr David Hart, NAHT
general secretary, said it was the roughest reception head teachers had ever
given an education secretary.
Writing in today's Financial Times on school league tables, Mr Patten says:
'Some (people) now seem to want to conceal information . . . It cannot be
right that education should be left - uniquely - as the public service for
which there is no freely available information on performance.'
Disputes over national curriculum testing and school league tables
overshadowed Mr Patten's announcement at the conference that sweeping
reforms of teacher training in primary schools would be published next week.
He said the burden would be shifted from higher education towards schools
and 'new routes into teacher training' would be opened up.
Delegates believed this signalled the end to the profession's 'graduates
only' status which it has enjoyed since 1972. The Department for Education
will publish full details of the reforms next week.
Mr Hart said the speech had been the opportunity for people to release pent
up feelings which had grown up over several months.
'If Mr Patten was not able to anticipate that he would receive an attitude
that was somewhat hostile, then he has totally misjudged the mood of the
profession,' he said.
'League tables do not make any contribution to the improvement of schools.'
Conference motions calling for a new, wider-ranging review of the national
curriculum, and for league tables of school performance to be discontinued,
were passed unanimously. Mr Patten described this as an attempt 'to reinvent
the past and go back to the closed secret garden of education'.
The three biggest teachers union are boycotting national curriculum tests,
due to start in secondary schools on Monday.
David Owen adds: Labour responded by claiming Mr Patten's speech had 'set
back the teaching profession a hundred years'.
Mr Win Griffiths, shadow schools minister, said the education secretary had
downgraded and deprofessionalised teaching and expected people to believe
this would improve quality.
'Teachers are, and must remain, professionals and not technicians,' he said.

FT  03 JUN 93 / EC to look for international links in racist attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is to investigate whether the recent spate of racist
attacks on foreigners across Europe is being fomented by groups organised
across national borders.
Spurred by the arson attack at Solingen in Germany, and Tuesday's burning of
a Turkish-owned electronics factory near Lyons in France, EC interior
ministers meeting in Copenhagen yesterday set up a working party to find out
whether the extreme right across Europe is co-ordinating an assault against
immigrants.
'We cannot give in to a centuries-old virus that obviously isn't dead,' said
Ms Ien Dales, the Dutch interior minister.
The decision came on the heels of an agreement by ministers to crack down on
illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers in the Community. It also
coincided with further wrangling about the failure of all 12 EC member
states to implement the European single market's injunction to grant free
movement of people within the Community.
The few officials at yesterday's meeting who were prepared to talk about the
investigation were unsure whether there was concrete evidence to suggest an
international grouping was organising pan-European racist attacks.
'The incidents are now so frequent that people fear there may be
co-ordination,' said one Dutch official. Mr Erling Olsen, the Danish justice
minister, said: 'We do not want to take the risk that it is co-ordinated.'
The initiative dovetails with an informal discussion held by interior
ministers last month at Kolding, Denmark, on whether there is 'any added
value in a common European response to racism and xenophobia', as a European
Commission official put it.
But ministers yesterday for the first time elevated their concerns about the
spread of racism to the same status as concerns over terrorism and organised
crime. These are the subject of a secretive, six-monthly 'threat analysis'
by EC interior ministers convened as the Trevi group to share intelligence
and co-ordinate their response.
Racism 'is now permanently on the Trevi agenda', a Dutch official said. The
object at national level, he added, would be 'to dig in to each incident, to
get to the bottom of every attack'. This should reveal whether the attacks
were co-ordinated, but would be worthwhile anyway, he suggested.
He and other officials insisted that tighter application of laws against
illegal immigration helped the cause of genuine asylum-seekers and would
enable EC states to take action to protect legal immigrants against attack
and discrimination.
Common standards on immigration, officials also argued, were essential to
allow free circulation of people inside the Community.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Germany, Japan under pressure over economies: US calls for
worldwide action to end recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday renewed its pressure on Japan and Germany to boost their
economies as a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development said unemployment in the industrial world was reaching
'alarming' levels.
Warning that 'the world cannot depend on growth in the United States to pull
it out of recession', Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, urged
Japan to increase its fiscal stimulus. He also called for 'further
substantial reductions' of European interest rates to promote faster growth.
This thinly veiled call on the Bundesbank to reduce its interest rates was
backed by the European Commission. Mr Henning Christophersen, commissioner
for economic affairs, said it was important to have further reductions in
short and long term European rates: 'Something has been done, but it is not
enough.'
Speaking on the first day of the OECD's annual ministerial meeting in Paris,
Mr Christophersen said the level of real interest rates was 'still very
high' in Europe. But the problem was not just confined to Germany. All
European Community states could do more, he said.
However, there was little sign that either Germany or Japan would take note
of these demands. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, made no
mention of interest rates in his speech. Instead, he painted a slightly more
optimistic picture of economic trends than the OECD, claiming that Germany's
economy would contract this year by 1 per cent compared with the OECD's
latest forecast of a 1.9 per cent decline.
In Bonn, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, firmly rejected
calls for swifter and more drastic cuts in German interest rates, but also
left the way open for further gradual reductions.
Addressing a bankers' conference on the eve of the Bundesbank's council
meeting to decide its rate policy, Mr Schlesinger said calls for 'further,
faster, helter-skelter interest rate cuts' to revive Germany's economy 'do
not tally with our view'.
'At the same time, the current level of interest rates on the money market
is no dogma for us; we must continually explore what is possible, what would
do the economy good, without arousing inflationary tendencies or
expectations by adopting too steep a path.'
Mr Hajime Funada, Japan's economic planning minister, reassured the OECD
meeting that recovery in Japan was starting. The Japanese government
believed it should be given time to implement its fiscal expansion packages
before embarking on further measures. Mr Funada also rejected a US call for
setting targets to reduce Japan's large current account surplus.
Mr Christophersen gave a bleak assessment of Europe's ability to stop the
rise in unemployment in the EC and European Free Trade Area countries
towards 23m by the end of next year. He said the EC economy would contract
this year and achieve only very modest growth in 1994. But Europe needed
growth of between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent to halt the rise in
unemployment and this could not be achieved before 1995.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No wonder Thames felt unable to follow North West Water's example by making
an enhanced scrip dividend to fund its international activities. The tax
saving would have been equally attractive, but Thames lost money outside the
water business last year once the contribution of group treasury and
insurance are stripped out. Having spent the proceeds of 1991's convertible
bond issue on loss-making engineering companies, Thames can hardly ask
shareholders for more. The company is wise to play down its international
ambitions until the existing empire is in better shape.
Nor, with gearing of only 31 per cent and relatively modest capital
expenditure plans, could Thames argue that it needs fresh equity for the
regulated water business. Yorkshire, which has lower gearing now but very
large capital expenditure plans in the second half of the decade, has a
better case in that regard. Yesterday's convertible bond issue could provide
Yorkshire with an injection of equity just as capital expenditure and
gearing are starting to climb. Anglian might make a similar case for an
enhanced scrip dividend or a convertible bond when its results are announced
next week.
With the outcome of the regulatory review so uncertain, though, the
companies might be better advised to wait before asking for equity for the
basic water business. If the review results in lower than expected capital
expenditure - and a fair-minded pricing regime - debt finance might yet
suffice.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Siebe's results are out, it is difficult to see why anyone thought
the company might need a rights issue in the short term. Thanks to further
rigorous cost cutting, particularly at Foxboro, net cash flow is up 19 per
cent. Strip the intangibles from the balance sheet and gearing would be 102
per cent instead of 60, but that matters little with interest cover of 4.3
times and a further drop in the interest charge expected this year. More
important is whether Siebe can follow up its efficiency gains with increased
volume. That looks a tall order in Europe and Japan, less so in the UK and
US.
Without Foxboro's contribution the results would be much less impressive.
Turnover elsewhere in the controls division fell markedly and margins were
slightly down. Thanks to its operational gearing, Foxboro should again help
group results this year; it has room to increase output by 25 per cent
without hitting bottlenecks. What that will do for the shares is another
matter. Siebe is already at a slight premium to the market and on a yield of
less than 3 per cent. Besides, it will need something to sustain momentum in
the medium term. That might eventually involve a rights issue, but it will
be lucky to find an acquisition as lucrative as Foxboro on which to spend
the money.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few investors have the power to move markets singlehandedly. Mr George Soros
is one. The formation of a Pounds 500m partnership between his Quantum Fund
and British Land was enough to jolt the UK property sector's stock market
value into a 6 per cent increase. In terms of sentiment, it is a spectacular
move - and an ingenious tool to market British Land's rights issue. Its
concrete impact, though, is far from clear. Mr Soros's recent interest in
gold and property may be seen as a punt on long term inflation. The more
prosaic truth may simply be that both assets are cheap.
The partnership aims to sink up to Pounds 1bn in UK property before the end
of 1997 - more than the total net institutional investment in property last
year. The risk is that its well-flagged intentions will move the market
against it. Sellers will hold on for better prices. Yields on prime
properties will continue to fall. British Land, which has bought Pounds 900m
of properties since 1988, certainly has a good record of going against the
grain. It may acquire parcels of assets or whole companies from the banks
direct. Mr John Ritblat's unusual requirement to buy back at a discount
shares in British Land from Quantum certainly provides an incentive to
ensure the joint venture succeeds.
This is not to say that the fundamentals in the property market are anything
other than tough. Tenant demand will lag general economic recovery. Until
employment levels pick up significantly, it is hard to see much improvement
in rental values. It is an odd situation when rising share prices provide
the main justification for brokers to lift their forecasts for net asset
values.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Expensive vote of confidence: The injection of Pounds 500m
of new funds into the UK property market may mark a turning point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the history of the 1990-93 property crash is written, yesterday's
announcement that George Soros had teamed up with British Land to invest in
UK property may be seen as confirmation that the market had turned.
Property shares rose across the board in response to the injection of up to
Pounds 500m of new funds and, more importantly, the vote of confidence in
Britain's property market by Mr Soros.
The investment decisions of the Hungarian-born investor have been followed
closely by the investment community ever since he made a fortune during
sterling's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September.
For close followers of the UK property market, the involvement of Mr John
Ritblat, chairman of British Land, was also encouraging. Mr Ritblat, a
survivor of the 1970s property crash, is widely seen as one of the shrewdest
players in the UK property market, having spent some Pounds 900m on property
during the depths of the downturn. British Land is now the fourth-largest
British property company by market capitalisation, at about Pounds 700m,
having overtaken more established players such as Hammerson.
The announcement of the joint venture between British Land and Mr Soros's
Quantum Fund was made against a backdrop of steadily improving prospects for
the commercial property industry. This is generally believed to date from
sterling's withdrawal from the ERM, which paved the way for lower interest
rates, economic recovery and potentially a revival over the longer term in
inflation, which enhances the investment appeal of assets such as property.
Improved confidence is most clearly seen in the performance of property
shares. Since mid-September, they have risen by 88 per cent across the board
compared with a rise of 26 per cent in the FTA-All Share index.
Characteristically, Mr Ritblat maintains that the property market bottomed
out long before anyone else noticed it. He publicly called the turn a year
ago. 'For the first time since 1989, we think we have now seen the worst,'
he said.
Mr Ritblat, the son of a Hampstead dentist, began his career at 17 working
for Edward Erdman, an estate agent. He soon formed his own agency, Conrad
Ritblat, which was taken over by a company called Union Property, which was
later reversed into British Land in 1970.
British Land, with Mr Ritblat at the helm, virtually collapsed in 1974, when
its share price fell to 3.5p. However, Mr Ritblat kept the support of the
banks, and the company had gained back its health by the end of the decade.
Although Mr Ritblat has increasingly won support from investors, his
aggressive style is disliked by some big UK institutional investors. The
friction came to a head in 1989 when he was forced to abandon a scheme to
split British Land in two, after several institutions protested at the terms
of the deal.
When he called the turn in the market a year ago, most observers were
unimpressed. Concern about the economy was deepening and high real interest
rates were causing tenant defaults and inflicting heavy strains on the
profit and loss accounts of highly geared companies such as British Land.
Moreover, the property market was reeling from a spate of bad news,
including the collapse of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. But Mr Ritblat argues
the pessimism was misplaced. 'A lot of less sophisticated people confuse
bankruptcies in the corporate sector with the underlying strength or
weakness of the property market,' he says.
Any confusion can be forgiven: the behaviour of the property market is far
from straightforward. Values generally are still falling, letting-boards
litter cities, companies are still collapsing and most companies are still
grappling with huge financial difficulties.
So far, any improvement in asset values is tentative and limited to small
pockets of the market, such as retail warehouses (where British Land has
been a notable investor).
Taken as a whole, the property market is still suffering from deep-seated
problems. The building surge in the late 1980s has resulted in a large
imbalance between supply and demand. In the City of London, one of the worst
markets, vacancy rates of 17 per cent are still high by historic standards.
In addition, there is a huge overhang of bank debt depressing the market.
International bank loans to the UK property industry now stand at Pounds
37bn, part of which will have to be written off. Many of the loans were
secured against property developments, which do not have rental income and
so have little prospect of finding a buyer.
The severity of some banks' problems was illustrated by last week's collapse
of Speyhawk, a development company which went into receivership with debts
of more than Pounds 350m.
The banks' problems with existing property loanbooks are affecting their
ability to make new loans. They are only prepared to lend against the very
best properties, thus preventing a recovery in the second tier of the
market.
So far, the embryonic signs of recovery can be ascribed to the relationship
of investment yields to interest rates. In recent years investment yields
have risen to a point where they have exceeded the yield on gilts for the
first time since the 1960s. When interest rates fell, the yield on property
exceeded the cost of finance, making it an attractive investment. At the end
of last year, the auction rooms reported brisk business as private investors
switched into property.
Overseas investors were conspicuous buyers. In particular, German investors
were attracted by the high yields on City office blocks and the fall in
sterling's value. Gradually, renewed interest spilled into institutional
investors, which have also returned selectively to the market.
Increasingly, investors are looking at property because they expect asset
values to rise. Until now, many have bought because of property's bond-like
income stream, but in future they anticipate capital growth. They expect
growth in two ways: from a fall in investment yields and from a rise in
rents.
Investment yields respond to the amount of money going into property.
Although there has not yet been any improvement in average yields, some
sectors such as retail warehouses and office buildings in central London
have already seen declining yields.
Yesterday's announcement that Quantum and British Land intended to invest
Pounds 500m (which, with borrowings, could total Pounds 1bn) in the property
market could help this trend, not least because property owners are
increasingly reluctant to sell good-quality property if they believe the
market has turned.
The Quantum/British Land announcement coincides with a spate of rights
issues, which will ease the pressure on property companies to sell property
and give them ammunition to do more deals. Property companies have made the
most of the revival in their share prices: nearly Pounds 750m has been
raised in the past three months. Industry observers believe that rights
issues worth a further Pounds 250m are in the pipeline.
It is possible that the stock market has exaggerated the extent of the
recovery in the underlying property market. A decline in investment yields
signals that investors believe rents are likely to rise. However, opinions
differ widely on the prospects for rental growth. Mr Ritblat believes rents
have virtually stabilised, although most agents report that they are still
falling. The outlook for rental growth depends, above anything else, on the
prospect for employment.
The feeble outlook for job creation, together with the banking sector's
property problems, means there is unlikely to be a rapid recovery in
property values across the board. The fundamental problems in the industry
will ensure that the decline will not give way to a sharp or immediate
upturn.
Nonetheless, there is growing conviction that the worst property decline
since the 1930s is over. 'Historically it looked unlikely that we could have
got into a sustained period of deflation and slump,' says Mr Ritblat. 'It
was obvious the cycle was bound to turn.'

Only in Italy can a transport minister, who fails his driving test, be
hailed as some sort of folk hero.
One of the very first things that Italy's new transport minister, Raffaele
Costa, did on taking up his post was to sit his country's new written
driving test along with the rest of his 54-strong parliamentary Transport
Commission. He had been deluged with complaints about trick questions and
the general difficulty of the examination. So he took the 30-question test,
requiring answers of true or false, and got eight questions wrong. No more
than four mistakes are allowed if a person is to pass.
Costa blames the exam rather than his lack of road knowledge and promises to
simplify the questionnaire. His growing band of supporters is hoping that
his next posting might be to Italy's finance ministry where he will be
required to take on an even more daunting challenge - filling in an Italian
tax form without making a mistake.

The more things change . . . British nostalgia buffs watching this week's
Channel 4 early-hours re-run of the 1950s Nat King Cole show may have noted
that what's now called political correctness was already in evidence four
decades back.
Cole's main guest was the scat singer, Cab Calloway, who performed It Ain't
Necessarily So from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, a number in which the raffish
character, Sportin' Life, mocks at religious stories.
What wasn't necessarily so in the original lyrics was 'the things that
you're liable to read in the bible'. And that was the version Calloway sang
when he played the role on the London stage in 1952.
But for his TV rendering five years later, the producers evidently thought
it safer to take on the priesthood than sects such as Jehovah's Witnesses,
who uphold the literal truth of the scriptures. The line had been altered to
'the things that the preacher is liable to teach yer'.

Eurospeak again befogged European Community proceedings yesterday, when the
interior and justice ministers of the 12 member states met in Copenhagen.
They found themselves faced with a linguistic problem - what French word to
use to indicate that their new drugs intelligence unit spans the whole of
the community?
Some, being familiar with the English phrase 'umbrella organisation',
favoured the direct translation parapluie. But as the word carrying the same
idiomatic sense to the French is 'hat', others wanted to use chapeau.
The presiding Danish minister finally produced a compromise. Instead of
opting for either hat or umbrella, he ruled, it would be best to be equipped
with both.

Parisians and others visiting the Louvre today should keep careful watch on
Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of the Mona Lisa to see whether her enigmatic
smile suddenly turns to a grimace.
If so, the reason will lie in tonight's London opening of the musical,
Leonardo: A Portrait of Love - although not in the plot, despite its
romancing about a highly improbable passion for her on the painter's part.
What is more likely to get up her nose is the musical's financial basis. It
is the crust of bird-droppings that covers most of the Pacific island of
Nauru.
The riches founded on the tiny republic's stock of guano were well known to
47-year-old Liverpudlian Duke Minks, who is a long-standing adviser to the
government. But he is also an impresario whose show-business career aptly
rests on still solider foundations. He was the lead singer in the 1960s
chart-topper, Concrete and Clay.
Having written much of the new musical, he took tape-recorded extracts to
Nauru, played them to senior ministers, and dropped lucky.
Not only did they pass over Pounds 2m backing, but the president and some 30
other government members are arriving to attend the first night. With their
guano due to run out in five years, they are hoping the show will pay a high
return by proving successful enough for transplanting to to other countries.
Let's hope it isn't given the bird.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Gone bananas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community's single market was supposed to bring lower prices
and greater competition. But for one commodity - bananas - the programme is
going wrong.
Unless challenges to the new banana regime - by Germany in the European
Court and by Latin American countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade - succeed, European consumers will end up paying far more than is
necessary for their bananas. Germany, the EC's largest consumer of bananas,
estimates that prices will be 70 per cent above free-market levels.
The regime, due to come into effect at the start of July, uses a tangle of
protectionist instruments: tight quotas for imports of cheap bananas from
Latin America, a share-out of quotas among importers, and punitive tariffs
on imports in excess of quotas. The aim of the regime, promoted in
particular by the UK, France and Spain, is to protect their traditional
suppliers in former colonies such as the Windward Islands and Jamaica, and
in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Canary
Islands. These growers of 'Eurobananas' sell their crop for almost twice the
price of Latin American growers of 'dollar-bananas'.
Bananas are currently protected by a patchwork of national restrictions,
doomed by the single market. There were fears that Eurobanana growers would
be driven out of business, without the protection provided by the new
EC-wide regime. But the EC is committed to protecting banana producers under
its Lome convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
Forget, for a moment, that the new regime makes a mockery of the single
market programme. Forget also that, in trying to help one group of
developing countries, the policy will harm another.
Even on its stated goal of helping traditional suppliers, the regime is
defective. It encourages continued dependency on a crop where they have no
long-term viability, because they will only receive support if they produce
bananas. Moreover, only a small fraction of the extra money paid by
consumers will go to banana growers, with the lion's share inflating the
profits of banana importers.
The right policy would be to encourage growers of Eurobananas to diversify.
Prices in EC markets should be lowered towards world market levels.
Meanwhile, growers of Eurobananas should be compensated for the difference
between the prices they can expect under the EC plan and world prices,
irrespective of whether they produce bananas. Ideally, the money would be
raised through general taxes. An alternative would be a low tariff on all
banana sales.
Such a policy would be in the long-term interests of Eurobanana growers. It
would also open up the market to dollar-banana growers and drive down prices
paid by Europe's banana eaters.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IN DOUBT, blame the Japanese. This seems to be the motto which both the
US Treasury team and the European Commission have emblazoned across their
collective chests as they attend this week's meeting of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. Why is the US recovery so sluggish,
and European growth non-existent? It's the Japanese trade surplus, stupid.
Japan officials should not be surprised that their trade surplus was treated
as a principal obstacle to global growth at yesterday's meeting, however
much they might resent their being treated as a scapegoat and however much
they might balk at calls for further yen appreciation. For US Treasury
secretary Lloyd Bentsen, worried by the halting performance of the US
economy and fighting congressional protectionists, Japan's surplus is an
easy, probably unavoidable, target.
Nor is it just US officials who find the Japanese surplus to be a convenient
diversion. This is also true for the European Community, whose economics
commissioner, Henning Christophersen, also told Japan to stimulate its
economy. For the source of Europe's problems lies closer to home,
demonstrated by the fact that Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger
simultaneously announced that Europe would remain trapped in the Buba's high
interest rate grip for some time.
Yet Lloyd Bentsen does have a good point, a rather more sophisticated one
than was the norm from previous US Treasury secretaries. Japan's trade and
current account surpluses are a problem, Mr Bentsen said, not because they
suggest that trade is unfair but because they are a sign that Japan's
domestic economy remains depressed. The surplus continues to rise, he
explained, because Japanese domestic demand is growing even more slowly than
income, thus depressing demand for US imports, undermining the US recovery
and depressing global growth.
Mr Bentsen's analysis, while stretching things a little, is broadly right.
Japan's trade surplus is currently high and rising because Japanese imports
are depressed. Japanese export volumes have risen by 9 per cent since the
beginning of 1990 but Japanese imports have fallen by 6 per cent. Little
wonder that Japan's trade surplus continues to grow, despite the yen's rise
to record highs.
The best way for Japan to stave off protectionist pressures from the US and
Europe is to get its stagnant domestic economy moving again. The fiscal
stimulus package must be implemented as quickly as possible; short-term
interest rates should be cut to stimulate monetary growth; and public funds
should be used to help commercial banks rid their balance sheet of bad debts
faster than at present. If Japan wants a quieter life, it should complain
less, listen harder and act faster.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Quantum leap forward / Assessing the strategy behind Soros's
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When markets move purely on the basis of one man's word and reputation, cui
bono and caveat emptor are usually sound maxims for those looking on. The
rise and fall of British investment guru Jim Slater in the 1970s, or the
mood swings of Henry Kaufman's following on Wall Street in the 1980s, offer
two obvious cautionary tales. Yet George Soros, founder of the offshore
Quantum Fund, is no ordinary guru; and while news of his move to invest in
UK commercial property set property shares abuzz yesterday, prices in the
direct property market are less susceptible to exhortation than in the stock
market. Nor is it in Soros's interest to whip up excitement in a market
where he has yet to invest his fund's money.
Soros's fame, or notoriety, stems in Britain from the vast profits that he
made from speculating against sterling before its exit from the exchange
rate mechanism last September. Latterly, his purchase of a stake in Newmont
Mining from Sir James Goldsmith and others caused a stir in the hitherto
depressed gold market. Yet the Quantum Fund has been making waves in global
markets for very much longer. It made a big killing in currency after Group
of Seven finance ministers agreed to assist the fall of the dollar at the
Plaza meeting in 1985. It then lost a fortune in the crash of October 1987.
The decision to link up with John Ritblat's British Land - unquestionably a
coup for the British property entrepreneur - is not the first indication
from the Quantum Fund of interest in real estate. In February Soros teamed
up with Paul Reichmann, of the insolvent Olympia &amp; York property group, to
invest in North American real estate. Taken together with the move into
gold, this has given rise to speculation that Soros is worried about
inflation.
In view of the weakness of the global economy, and the total failure of both
gold and property to provide a hedge against inflation over the past decade,
this seems rather implausible. A simpler explanation might be that both
markets have been heavily depressed, while many equity and bond markets have
been run up to dizzy heights. The question this time is whether the judgment
of Soros is vintage '85 or '87.
Certainly the case for property in the US and UK looks compelling. Economic
recovery in both countries, which holds the key to a reduction in the
present oversupply of real estate, is taking place ahead of continental
Europe and Japan. Yields - the income expressed as a percentage of the price
 -are at historically high levels. While many British properties are let at
rents well in excess of current market values, the structure of the
old-style British institutional lease with upwards-only rent reviews
provides protection where the tenant is of high quality. While such leases
are unavailable on many new developments, they continue to provide what
amounts to a financially engineered income stream on much of the existing
stock of offices, shops and industrial premises.
In fact, Soros already has some indirect experience of the British property
market. He invested in a consortium that made a disastrous purchase of
property group Imry at the peak of the market in 1989. But this was a small
stake, and the big loser from the deal was the bank that provided the
finance, Barclays. The chips in the present transaction are bigger and it
remains to be seen how a hedge fund such as Quantum, whose modus operandi is
based on a swift kill in liquid markets, adapts to the slower pace of the
much less liquid property market and to the habits of its joint venture
partners.
But Soros is not a man to underestimate - witness his impressive capacity
for recycling the British taxpayers' money to eastern Europe. No doubt the
recent devaluation of the peseta will have yielded a similar bonus for the
eastern Europeans. It will be harder to extract such profits from bricks and
mortar.
Indeed, property is notoriously difficult to acquire, except when no one
else wants it. But that is invariably the best time to buy. The long neglect
of real estate by British investment institutions is a strong indication
that Soros, infallible or otherwise, has got his timing right.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: The Sun seems to have what it wants in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir FRED CATHERWOOD MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is useful to have The Sun's black propaganda against the European
Community ('Mass trick treaty', May 1) set out in concise form since it is
much easier to answer:
Under the Maastricht treaty, the elected European parliament has to vote for
the president of the European Commission and for the commissioners so that
they are as accountable to an elected body as our national governments.
The elected British parliament has had no sovereignty over the key factors
in the British economy for years now. When was it last consulted about the
exchange rate change?
The Sun's readers want a note with the Queen's head on it called a pound -
don't we all? But the question is, what is it worth? Between the time it was
tied to the dollar (1972) and the time it was tied again to the European
Monetary System (1992), it has lost nearly nine-tenths of its value. Was the
House of Commons responsible for that? In the brief time we were linked,
interest rates have come down by a third and inflation by half.
The Maastricht treaty removes the dependence of the EMS on the D-Mark by
giving all countries equal power - exactly what The Sun seems to want.
Among our partners in the Community, we have fought our last three European
wars in alliance with the French, who were in from the beginning, unlike the
US which arrived a bit late the last two times.
We have at least this in common with the Greeks: our Queen married a Greek
prince. We are both victims of sailors and in the last century and the last
war we did our best to restore and to protect the democracy to which we are
both dedicated.
It is not possible to have a free trade area without the political clout to
protect it - to reform agriculture, to protect the passage of exports and
put right all the wrongs about which The Sun complains.
Finally, if we can stand shoulder to shoulder in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation with foreign commanders, what is the problem?
Or is it that Nato is OK because the commander in chief is an American - and
so is the owner of The Sun?

FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: Guidance on quality standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'BSI guidance for small firms' (June 1) records that 'purchasers have
misunderstood the nature of the standard (BS 5750) and insist wrongly on all
their suppliers being registered to BS 5750'. Purchasers mistakenly believe
BS 5750 to be a product quality standard whereas it is a documented quality
management system of business procedure.
The Department of Trade and Industry confirms that 'BS 5750 is not a product
quality system and does not directly improve the standard of the
organisation's products and services nor does it confer excellence on the
certified organisation, its products or services'.
It is to be hoped the new BSI guide to purchasers will refer them to the
Guidelines of Purchasing Practices issued by the Department of Environment
in August 1992 which stated: 'A requirement that tenderers should be
certificated under quality assurance standard BS 5750 . . . may restrict
competition . . . and the absence of such certification cannot therefore be
considered to indicate necessarily that a company is not competent to carry
out work. An authority should not reject tenders solely on the grounds that
a company does not have, or does not intend to have, a quality management
system provided it is willing to offer other acceptable assurances or
evidence of its capacity to carry out work according to specification.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Personal View: Quality control is here to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PATTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is sometimes the fate of education secretaries and general secretaries of
teacher associations and unions to have to shout to make themselves heard
above the din. All very different from the quiet discussions I have had in
many classrooms and staff rooms during visits to schools. Parents will be
first to applaud if we now enter a phase of quiet and constructive dialogue
after the great educational debate of this spring. I hope we never again see
industrial action in our classrooms.
As I have always said, my overriding objective is to raise standards. So is
ours, say Peter Smith and David Hart in their interesting article in the FT
('The ABCs of a sensible testing policy', May 13). The purpose of testing
is, they write, principally to provide 'confident information about how
children are performing . . .'
I agree. I am all the more sad, therefore, that some now seem to want to
conceal information. The performances of the health service, the police and
local government are all carefully measured. It cannot be right that
education should be left - uniquely - as the public service for which there
is no freely available information on performance. Taxpayers, who contribute
billions of pounds every year to education, have a right to know if that
money is producing good results, and about which schools are performing
well. Tests and the publication of results are an important part of the
process of ratcheting up standards.
The premise for any dialogue must be the success of the national curriculum.
We cannot raise standards unless we first raise our expectations of what
children can, and should, achieve. The national curriculum does that by
setting challenging national targets for all pupils across a broad and
balanced curriculum. I long ago concluded that the need for such information
is greatest in the basics of English, mathematics and science.
This is an ambitious reform. Unlike our main competitors, we have never set
ourselves clear national standards. That is one of the reasons - perhaps the
most important - why the achievements of our pupils, particularly in the
middle and lower ability ranges, lag behind those in France, Germany and
Japan. The government is determined that we should catch up.
The counterpart of setting demanding standards is measuring whether you
reach them; in other words, good educational quality control. Only those who
are indifferent to success eschew the opportunity to gauge how close or how
far we are from achieving it. That is where tests come in. National tests
are here to stay. They are integral to the national curriculum. Without
tests, the standards set out in the national curriculum have no real meaning
or force.
Some of the critics of the testing arrangements often forget this umbilical
link with the national curriculum. Tests are designed both to provide
diagnostic information for teachers and a measure of children's progress for
parents. They do this because they are anchored by the standards prescribed
in the national curriculum.
The tests enable teachers to diagnose where pupils are falling short of
expected standards and to remedy shortcomings. Of course the quality of
education is as high in some of our schools as anywhere in the world, but
the urgent need for diagnosis is manifest in the large numbers of young
people who leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills needed to
make the best of further education or employment. The cost to business of
poor skills in literacy and numeracy is now put at Pounds 5bn a year.
The published test results also show how pupils, individually and
collectively, are measuring up to national standards and how those standards
are moving over time. Disengage the tests from the curriculum targets and
they will cease to act as an effective measure. Parents and others would be
denied an important opportunity to gauge whether or not a school was
improving on past performance.
Last year's tests for 14-year-olds in mathematics and science went well. In
fact a great deal of time and effort - three years of trials in the case of
this summer's tests for 14-year-olds - has gone into writing tests which are
a fair reflection of what pupils have been taught.
The government and Sir Ron Dearing (chairman of the new School Curriculum
and Assessment Authority) both take the view that the tests should go ahead
in order to learn lessons for the future as well; one year's tests are
always a staging post on the way to the next. Meanwhile I have asked Sir Ron
to review the curriculum and assessment framework to see how its overall
manageability for teachers can be improved. Teachers have worked hard since
the national curriculum was introduced to put it into place.
The review will consider whether the current curriculum can be focused more
sharply so that teachers are clearer about their objectives. It will
consider how the arrangements for assessing children's progress against
those targets can be streamlined without loss of rigour, but to the benefit
of manageability. What is the best balance between tests and teachers' own
assessments of school work? How can we minimise the administration of the
tests? Will external marking provide a solution? Our aim is to create a
broad and effective evolutionary framework within which teachers, governors
and parents can act in the best interests of their schools.
That brings me back to the need for a continuing national dialogue and
debate. Higher standards in our schools are vital to our national well-being
 -education is one of Britain's most important enterprises.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The other 'great depression'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an article on March 25 ('Tide turns in the world economy') I suggested
that we might be seeing a sea change in the world economy. The word
'deflation' was not used. But there does seem to have been a trend towards
ever lower inflation, taking one cycle with another.
The main industrial countries witnessed twin inflationary peaks of inflation
in 1974 and 1980 following the first two oil price explosions. Since then
the inflation trend has been decidedly downwards. The next cyclical peak in
1990, associated with both a worldwide credit boom and the temporary upsurge
in oil prices following Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, was very much lower. Since
then inflation in most countries has fallen to levels not seen since the
1960s, and could go lower still.
This view of rapidly falling inflation, not just from one year to another
but from one business cycle to another, has received a slight dent from the
flurry of interest in gold, and the proclaimed interest in that metal of one
or two well- known individual investors. There are also a few political
straws in the wind suggesting that democracies have not the patience to
persevere with low inflation. The probability, however, is that the forces
making for low inflation are too powerful to be overthrown by political
eddies in favour of cheap money and lots of it.
The secular fall in inflation has been accompanied, unfortunately, by a
secular rise in unemployment. There are many structural as well as monetary
reasons for this rise. But in view of the rigidities in wage and price
adjustment, the pressures to reduce inflation have also meant severe job
losses.
The problem with diagnosing such trends is that people rush to ask: 'Are you
predicting another great depression like that of the 1930s?', even though
nothing remotely resembling it has so far occurred.
The difficulty is that in examining eras of modest growth in total spending
and downward pressure on prices and wages, people only have the 1930s in
mind. It is worth looking at the last previous period of downward pressures
to broaden one's view of what can occur. This period was in the UK from 1873
to 1896 and was indeed once known as 'the great depression'. It gave rise to
the first of the many fruitless inquiries about why Britain was being
overtaken and to strictures on the laziness of the third generation of
businessmen.
In the eyes of subsequent historians, the period was one of deflation, but
not depression. The title of a historical booklet, Professor S B Saul's The
Myth of the Great Depression, 1873-1896 (Macmillan 1989), tells its own
story. As Prof Saul remarks, the most unmistakable movement of the whole
century was that for 14 years after 1873 UK wholesale prices, with one
slight respite, 'fell without cease, overriding all shorter cyclical
fluctuations'.
After that there was a modest upswing; but there was a further fall after
1891, which took prices down a further 10 per cent below the 1887 level.
Because most industrial countries were linked via the gold standard they saw
similar price falls.
Why did prices fall in the late 19th century? At one time historians used to
make great play with specific factors such as the Bessemer process which
brought down the price of steel rails. The pages of notes on such subjects
explain why people such as the late Anthony Crosland regarded economic
history as a bore. Such micro explanations do not tell us why innovation
expressed itself in falling prices in one period and rising money wages in
another.
A more convincing explanation comes from the monetary side. The absence of
new gold discoveries until the end of the 1880s, and the rush of new
countries to join the gold standard after 1870, increased the demand for
gold relative to the supply. As the amount of bank notes and deposits was
still related to gold, the growth of both the US and British money supplies
slowed down.
The original reason why Prof Saul and other historians rejected the idea of
'the great depression' is that it is associated with the dubious idea of
50-year-long Kondratieff economic cycles. (Alas, I cannot engage in
one-to-one correspondence with readers who believe in such cycles.)
Moreover, the period is given a false precision from the 1873 peak in prices
and activity and the sharpness of the upswing of the late 1890s.
But the basic reason why the period was not a depression is that real growth
was not depressed. The depression idea derived credence from a slowdown in
the growth of UK industrial production after 1873. Even in these terms what
occurred was a once-and-for-all slowdown from mid-Victorian growth rates.
More recent estimates, which cover the whole national income including the
rapidly rising service sector, do not show a slowdown.
Indeed, real GDP continued to grow at trend rates, despite short-term
fluctuations. As the table shows, the average rate of increase over the
period 1873-99 (virtually the 'great depression' years) was 2.1 per cent per
annum, slightly above the average for the 60 years before the first world
war. The slowdown in output growth occurred in the subsequent period up to
1913 when prices were rising once more.
While the growth of real output was maintained in 'the great depression',
the jobless story was different. Unemployment is estimated, on the basis of
union returns, to have risen from an average of 5 per cent in 1851-73 to 7.4
per cent in 1874-95, before falling back to 5.4 per cent in 1896-1914.
The wages chart is suggestive. It shows that, despite the downward pressures
from the demand side, money wages continued to grow over the 1873-96 period
taken as a whole. Prof Saul writes of 'the ability of wage earners to force
money wages up above prices in the boom years and to maintain a money wage
plateau in between'. The result was that when the growth of nominal demand
slowed down the share of profits was squeezed.
The prosperity of the period was at the expense of those who became
unemployed. This, together with the pressure on profits and the shift in the
economic structure away from manufacturing, produced a lack of confidence
and doom-laden writings all too familiar to someone looking back from the
late 20th century.
Net domestic capital formation was not in fact very different in 1873-96
from what it was before or after, measured in a percentage of gross domestic
product. But as the 19th century drew to a close it fell behind the
corresponding proportions in the US and Germany. Whether or not a long-term
British economic disease was already taking root is a separate historical
controversy from that of the supposed 'great depression'.
The 1873-96 episode suggests that deflation need not mean depression or the
absence of growth. But it is likely to mean pressure on profits and jobs;
and the same is likely to apply to its modern equivalent of severe downward
pressure on the inflation rate. Comparison with the true depression of the
1930s emphasises how important it is to prevent a slowdown in the growth of
nominal demand from degenerating into a self-perpetuating downward spiral.
This happened in the 1930s much more in the US and Germany than it did in
the UK, but the result spread worldwide.
A moral from the late 19th century is the importance of pay and price
flexibility. There are today more institutional obstacles to such
flexibility than there were then. On the other hand, with a much higher real
national income per head, it ought to be easier to top up the pay of those
who suffer most from taking a pay cut or give up a pay increase to preserve
jobs. If genuine deflation need not involve depression, how much more does
that go for the symptoms associated with the achievement of low inflation.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: Self-regulation is best route to curb excessive
directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Broome's letter (May 29) calling for legislation to curb excessive
directors' remuneration will find support with many private and some
institutional shareholders. However, the Cadbury report has only been
published for six months and is already changing the map of corporate
governance, helped by the call from Postel/Gartmore for a reduction in
three-year rolling contracts that can keep too many marginal performers in
their jobs.
Judging by the regulatory problems stemming from the Financial Services Act
in 1986, I suspect that the self-regulatory route will be more effective and
certainly quicker. The Americans are, for instance, having problems
legislating for the non-tax allowability of compensation over Dollars 1m for
each of the top five corporate officers in public companies when the payment
has not received shareholders' approval. Shareholders could pay excessive
remuneration and extra tax, thus facing a double whammy.
We work for owners, compensation committees and non-executive directors and
from our experience would suggest three additional areas for self-regulatory
pressure:
That the compensation committee advisers should be named in the annual
report.
That the future pension cost of directors' penultimate salary awards should
be certified by the actuaries as already funded by pension surpluses or, if
not, what the future corporate cost will be.
That a mini-Cadbury, laying out best practice for smaller public and large
private companies, should be commissioned in the very near future. For
instance, the requirement to have three non-executive directors is quite
unrealistic for many such boards, but there seem to be more issues
concerning the independence of pension fund trustees in groups of this size.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Letter: No way to respond to capital idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P R PENNINGTON-LEGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The laconic dismissal by David James at the Royal Albert Hall meeting
of Lloyd's Names of the ability of the Society of Lloyd's to raise capital
on the international capital markets is typical of the closed mind and
closed-door response to the idea ('Lloyd's urges Names to settle grievances
through negotiation', May 26).
What this well-known company doctor cursorily dispatches with the short
dictum that the bond idea is 'non-viable' is similarly dealt with in single
words such as 'unrealistic', 'impractical' and 'undesirable' within the
business plan.
This lack of explanation is not acceptable. Yet without hint of irony Names
learn that there are queues of institutions and blue-chip companies (which
Names were told so impressed Mr James), which are nevertheless clamouring to
invest in Lloyd's because future profits will be so great.
Both assumptions cannot be right.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Gabriel ascends to super stardom - Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a superstar Peter Gabriel is oddly self-effacing. When he broke away
from Genesis to go solo he hid himself behind make up and masks; then
absorbed himself in WOMAD, his admirable if doomed attempt to bring the
music of Africa, Latin America, everywhere, to a record-buying public; and
now, on his first global tour in six years, he has handed over his
performance to the hot Canadian director Robert Lepage.
Since Gabriel never possessed a mind-blowing voice this is no bad thing.
Lepage has served him, and the audience, proud. We get not one stage, but
two. A square back area, surmounted by the inevitable screen, is joined by a
moving walkway to a circular stage thrust into the stadium.
But this is just the start of the spectacle. On 'Shaking the Tree', a mature
tree grows up in seconds. For 'Blood of Eden', the most affecting of the
songs on the new album which lies behind this visit, we get not mechanical
gimmickry but waif-ish Sinead O'Connor, bald and barefoot and oddly
Eve-like.
By 'Digging the dirt' Lepage is in overdrive. In addition to the mouth mike,
Gabriel's head is cluttered with an inward looking camera which offers to
the screen close ups of his facial tissue usually only permitted to a
beautician. At the same time he fondles a white structure on stage which
materialises into a plaster cast of his face.
And on and on, each song choreographed to excite the eye, with only
'Sledgehammer' stripped down to a rock solo, complete with thrusting pelvis.
Near the end the excellent band makes its way along the catwalk to the next
gig to disappear in turn through a suitcase while Gabriel displays his
stellar status by making a significant exit, enveloped from above by a
descending dome.
The spacecraft rises to reveal the regrouped musicians playing 'In your
eyes' and then the resonate 'Biko', Gabriel's moving tribute to the
assassinated African politician, which always closes his show with political
correctness and an irresistible chorus.
As a Peter Gabriel sceptic I was completely won over by the spectacle, if
not by the music. You hardly think about the cost: just enjoy the vision. It
is emotional spoonfeeding of the most extravagant kind, but extremely
pleasant - for a while.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Smiles with the open-air Shrew - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The open air season at Regent's Park has begun without the overwhelming need
for an extra sweater or blanket and a slightly underwhelming production of
The Taming of the Shrew which should mature with the summer.
To be fair to the company, The Shrew is about the only Shakespeare work
where you might have to apologise for the play rather than the performance.
Apart from the taming, which even in former times could be seen as going a
mite too far in the direction of female submissiveness, there is not much of
a plot, there is no obvious motivation and one of the few memorable lines is
the title.
Yet the piece has always acted much better than it reads and to the credit
of Toby Robertson, the director, he does not try to read any significance
into the text that isn't there. The aim here is fun: smiles on a summer
night.
The colours are bright as if the circus or the commedia dell'arte has come
to town. One man balances delicately on a large ball. Another is on a pair
of stiletto stilts. The pantomime horse is more of a thoroughbred than an
old nag. Paul Edwards, the designer, knows how to light up the park.
The male and female leads are initially disconcerting. Geordie Johnson's
Petruchio has the mid-Atlantic accent of someone slipping in from the
movies. In fact, this slightly Errol Flynn approach is a good way of playing
the part. Johnson is an experienced Canadian actor.
Cathy Tyson's Katherina (the shrew) sounds as if she has come from
Lancashire. There is no reason why she should, but equally no reason why she
shouldn't. She seems thoroughly to enjoy herself. Petruchio breaks her in as
you would break in a horse. At first both he and Katherina have whips:
Petruchio ends up with both of them and the promise of a smooth ride - again
a perfectly reasonable way to play a not very rational text.
Where the production stars is in adding a bit to the induction scene at the
end. The piece starts with Christopher Sly being thrown out of a hostelry,
taken home by a lord and being induced to believe that he belongs to more
aristocratic surroundings. He then watches The Shrew, but disappears from
the text.
In the Regent's Park version he darts around the audience while the play
goes on, and is finally redeposited on the stage, drunk as at the start.
When he awakes it is as if he has been through Bottom's dream. This is a
wonderful way of demonstrating that Shakespeare really did have something to
do with the the text.
It also adds to the magic of Regent's Park. Sly is played by Dennis Clinton,
who has a lot to do with making the production work: it slows down notably
in part of the second act when he is not around.
Incidentally, problems with The Shrew are as old as Shakespeare. The play
was always being renamed and rewritten, whether as Catherine and Petruchio
or Kiss Me Kate. It was not until 1844 that that the original version,
including the induction scene, was revived at the Haymarket. No other
Shakespeare play underwent such prolonged neglect. You can see why, but you
can see also the timeless attraction of the central ploy.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Old boys who refuse to grow up - Abbey Theatre, Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN

<TEXT>
Bernard Farrell's new play shows five apparently normal men reduced to
emotional wrecks in the course of a school reunion. There are no old school
ties sported here: the Apaches, the scourge of the class of '78 in a large
Dublin Comprehensive, are now young professionals of varying degrees of
respectability. Instead of going home for sandwiches and cake at pub closing
time, they break into the old school, and hold their reunion in a gaunt
Victorian classroom with tall windows and cobweb-hung lights perfectly
evoked by Frank Hallinan Flood's gloomily realistic set.
Harry, a dubious travel agent laden with cases of lager, his mobile phone
buzzing with news of delayed charter flights, is planning a simple 'piss
up', but Maurice, a psycho-babbling ex-seminarian turned insurance broker,
produces a five-point programme and a film projector. Jimmy, the pest
control specialist (not ratcatcher), expecting another sort of evening
altogether, brings his ex-wife Deirdre and a tin of meringues, prompting
Nick, the pony-tailed fashion designer (or is it window dresser?) to go home
for his wife, Jackie. This is a move he quickly regrets when her
ex-boyfriend, the fifth Apache, Paudge, arrives unexpectedly from his
prosperous Tipperary farm. The first act passes in a flash as the play
skilfully and very funnily reveals the insecurities of the ill-matched
group.
The second act opens with Item Three on Maurice's programme: Film. His home
movie leads to the revelation that Paudge and not Nick is the father of
Jackie's daughter, and then to the first of a series of physical attacks.
Meanwhile Deirdre's guileless revelations of Jimmy's sexual preferences
(involving her nurse's uniform and a pair of fireman's boots) provoke Jimmy
to that immemorial cue for the major marital row: 'I think you've had enough
to drink'.
But all this is peripheral to the play's central themes of guilt and
self-deception. Maurice wants the Apaches to face up to the fact that their
bullying was responsible for the suicide of one of their schoolmates,
Gregory. Suddenly, perhaps too suddenly for comfort, the ragging is over and
it all turns deadly serious as the Apaches are forced to confront their own
cruelty and its tragic consequences. So far the evening has been easy going
and undemanding, but suddenly we are asked to consider the mindless cruelty
of children, and almost as bad, the mindless refusal of these grown men to
come to terms with their past.
The play is directed with superb pace by Ben Barnes, but even his best
efforts cannot ease the difficult transition from comedy to tragedy. In a
generally strong cast, Jane Brennan's carefully controlled Deirdre never
puts a foot wrong while Arthur Riordan's Maurice grows ever more sinister
and enigmatic. Lines were occasionally gobbled or fluffed but perhaps this
was due to the prodigious on-stage consumption of lager.

Coverage of the First Test between England and Australia begins on BBC1 at
10.55 am and switches to BBC2 at 4.00 pm, with highlights introduced by the
admirable Richie Benaud on BBC1 at 11.30 pm. Business Matters (7.20 BBC2)
reports on Vietnam, 18 years after the war with the US. Having made the
mistake of winning, the Vietnamese are finding that the Americans have more
ways of imposing their will abroad than merely dropping high explosive on
people's heads: they are now up against a trade embargo and a ban on loans
from the IMF and the World Bank. If BBC1 is to succeed with its new
'comedy', Every Silver Lining, people are going to have to rack their brains
and do something radical; put in some jokes, preferably. There is nothing
wrong with Andrew Sachs and Frances de la Tour, they just need some funny
lines (8.30 BBC1). BBC2's usually excellent documentary series Under The Sun
reports from Cameroon on 'The Sultan's Burden': the government will not let
Sultan Issa Maigari raise taxes and the peasants are rebelling. Even the
royal praise-singer has betrayed him (9.35).

A MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART (15) Vincent Ward
FALLING DOWN (18) Joel Schumacher
FRAUDS (15) Stephan Elliot
JAMON JAMON (18) Bigas Luna
WIDE SARGASSO SEA (18) John Duigan
What is humanity's position in Time and Space as we near the close of the
20th century? This is a large, possibly lunatic question; but it is not too
large nor too lunatic for the cinema. Movies have always claimed the right
to speak of all things for all people: whether through the globe- and
decade-hopping sweep of a film like New Zealand's A Map Of The Human Heart
or the flashpoint-apocalypse style of Hollywood, exemplified by Falling
Down.
In both films we are supposed to think: 'Ah, this is the way the world
crumbles]' Cinema uses its native realism - living actors in living scenery
 -to foist on us its eschatological mysticism. Push your characters through
enough visceral, headline-plucked crises and the filmgoer cannot fail (hope
the film-makers) to see the realism of the parts adding up to the
judgment-day truth of the whole.
But common sense always fights back. During 100 years of film history,
audiences have invented their own defence against aesthetic hoodwinking. It
is the notion of 'camp': the awareness that large gestures, far from
indicating large thoughts, often betray pintsize ideas or emotions.
'Camp' is present in both these new films from opposite ends of the planet.
A Map Of The Human Heart makes metaphors as vast, flamboyant and perishable
as ice palaces. The main leitmotif is cartography. Eskimo hero Avik (Jason
Scott Lee) begins as a map-maker, helping a British airman (Patrick Bergin)
chart the Arctic wilderness in 1931; then becomes a lovelorn TB sufferer in
Montreal, clutching the X-rays of his beloved like another, interior 'map';
then is enlisted by Bergin in a top secret mission to salvage maps from a
wrecked German U-boat; then re-meets his adored Albertine (Anne Parillaud),
who is working on aerial reconnaissance photos (more 'maps'); finally joins
the dread flying mission over that network of doomed human souls called
Dresden.
We say 'finally'. But that merely concludes Avik's adventures in perfidious
Albion and war-ravaged Europe. At the end - and throughout a film that
bounces over the world's surface like a Mexican jumping bean with a flag in
the top - Avik returns to the unmappable Arctic. Here a cold infinity at
last laps him up, drowning the last illusory contours of human certainty.
Director Vincent Ward specialises in throwing audiences into landscapes of
pea-souper perplexity - see Vigil and The Navigator - and then saying 'Find
your way out'. If he makes a film about maps, we know it is to mock them. If
he makes a film about a hemisphere-hopping hero, it is to mock heroism and
hemispheres and hopping.
A Map Of The Human Heart can look and sound dazzling: from the early scene
of the Eskimo boy trampolining into the sky as if to pluck down the plane
that will change his life to the last aerial shot of waters swelling around
his sinking ice-floe.
But whenever narrative sense tries to creep in, realism and operatic
resonance make daft bedfellows. Avik and Albertine entwined in passion atop
a barrage balloon; Bergin spitting out literary arias of venom as sexual
jealousy turns him from friend to fiend; and in the hospital scenes Jeanne
Moreau as a vengeful, mad-eyed Catholic nun escaped from a Bunuel film.
'Camp' - that mismatch between the force of the underlying ideas and the
billowing flamboyance of the surface - grows ever larger as the film grows
longer.
* * * Meanwhile, in another part of Hyperbole-land, Falling Down shows the
state of urban crisis Los Angeles has now reached, and the state of
storytelling crisis Hollywood has reached. The film begins grim -
hedgehog-haired yuppie Michael Douglas stuck in a sweating, fume-polluted
traffic jam and getting out to walk across town - and gets grimmer. Mr
Douglas is a member of that endangered American species: the disaffected
ordinary rightwing kinda-guy. You could call him 'dork' for short, though
the movie prefers to call him D-Fens after his car number-plate.
D-Fens used to work for a private defence firm but was laid off. Now, with a
baseball bat, a bagful of guns and a panjandrum of grievances, he walks in
the general direction of his estranged wife (Barbara Hershey), pursued by
retiring cop Robert Duvall, whose last day on the force becomes a lulu. Can
Duvall stop our hero punching, menacing or shooting almost everyone he
meets?
For D-Fens is upset by the incursions made on his life, liberty and pursuit
of happiness by traffic jams, street delinquents, Korean corner-shops,
feminists, and burger joints that stop serving breakfast at 11.30am. He also
has sharp words for golfers and neo-Nazi homophobic shop-owners (Frederic
Forrest). And he may bash up his wife and child - or so Hershey fears - once
he reaches their pretty suburban nook in Venice, Calif.
Based on the structure of Homer's Odyssey, but without Homer's flair for
getting on with it, Falling Down is two hours of shamelesly repetitive
hokum. Screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith and director Joel (Flatliners) Schumacher
clearly feel that if you are making a malcontent-on-the-run movie, you must
include everything anyone could be malcontented about. The anger must be
cross-party. If you offend Asians with a scene in which D-Fens breaks up a
shop and derides the owner's accent ('There's a V in 'five']'), you must
then hasten your protagonist to a golf course, where he can induce an
11th-hole cardiac by railing about misused parkland. 'Children should be
playing here]' 'There should be zoos]' etc.
Has ever such a bigot for all seasons ever existed? We doubt it. If
flat-earthers and vegans are missing from the hit list, it can only be
because something had to hit the cutting-room floor. Douglas plays the role
with a clench-jawed, weapon-waving automatism and the only actor resisting
the melodramatic flood is Duvall, whose low-key cracker-barrel homeyness is
a relief in (too) short stretches.
* * * Hollywood hyperbole ends unwittingly in Camp. Other movies, like
Australia's Frauds and Spain's Jamon Jamon, go to that region deliberately.
Gestural excess is their aim and design. In Stephan Elliott's Frauds
semi-mad insurance investigator Phil Collins plays tricks on a young
suburban couple (Hugo Weaving, Josephine Byrnes). Having caught them out in
a fraudulent claim - they 'staged' a burglary of their own home - he teases
them into a nervous breakdown. Stolen goods reappear; life-or-death games
are played with dice; and fiendish Phil finally traps them inside the giant
Avengers-style playroom, bristling with booby-traps, that passes for his
home.
You half expect Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg to come chortling out of the
woodwork. Instead all the camping up is done by Collins: a humpty-dumpty
joker with two pinprick eyes, several Swinging Sydney suits and a switch-on
V-shaped smile to match his receding widow's peak hair. He could almost be
one of his own toys. So could the film, though at 94 minutes it outstays its
initially amusing appeal.
Jamon Jamon - Spanish for 'Ham Ham' - is a large joint of exactly that.
Half-a-dozen heated performers overheatedly perform in this comic passion
play by director Bigas Luna. Since the death of Franco, Spain has discovered
all sorts of previously hidden pleasures. Sex, underwear fetishism, nude
bullfighting, urination contests: all here in the tale of young Jose Luis,
his love for Silvia and his rivalry with hunky Raul. Luna's camera careers
round the torrid landscapes and the torrid figures inside them, creating
excess where he cannot find it. Seldom has a film that spends so much time
below the belt seemed so over the top.
As for Wide Sargasso Sea, pity poor Jean Rhys. Directed by John Duigan
(Flirting), the novelist's haunting Caribbean-set prequel to Jane Eyre - the
story of the doomed first Mrs Rochester - begins as Reader's Digest and
turns slowly into Playboy. Soft-porn rompings ad nauseam in rockpools and
bedrooms. The film would be camp if it had the energy to deserve the word.
Instead it is more like a long night under soggy canvas.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Trial by Jury in ideal surroundings - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best joke of the BOC Covent Garden Festival has been in setting. No, not
The Magic Flute in the Freemasons' Hall, but Trial by Jury in Bow Street
Magistrates' Court. The performance was not wonderful; it never interfered
with the immense fun of watching Gilbert and Sullivan's travesty of a
breach-of-promise trial in one of the most celebrated courtrooms in the
country.
The chamber proved ideally intimate; the production, by John Gardner, was
updated. Some jurors carried tabloid newspapers, and at the end Judge and
plaintiff posed for press photographs.
It cannot be said too often, however, that Gilbert and Sullivan would be
more seriously funny if singers trusted the music and stopped behaving as if
they knew very well they were part of a jolly amusing jape. Worst culprit
here was the Judge - Robert Neil Kingham. Most nearly scotfree was the
defendant, Andrew Busker, singing with blithe ease and never mugging once.
Yet why dress him in T-shirt and jeans? The words tell you he has respect
for the court, and the music gives him so plain a kind of tawdry
lower-middle-class heroism that you know he should be wearing at least a
tie, if not also a nasty double-breasted suit.
Over at the Donmar Warehouse, travesty of another kind. I have been catching
the Second Annual Farewell Recitals of Vera Galupe-Borszkh (traumatic
soprano) since 1988, and the pleasure does not pall. The great, the abiding,
joke here is Vera herself, with her grande dame gown, jewels and hairdo,
calmly hellbent on making opera communicate to us, giving us a strenuous and
ludicrous explanation of what each of her arias is about, and during the
aria underlining the point of every phrase with graphic mime.
Azucena not only scorches her fingers on the pyre into which she has just
thrown her baby, she then puts on glasses to check that it was indeed her
baby - 'Il figlio mio]' All done with Vera's incomparably silly earnestness,
her intensely unspontaneous delivery, and her crack musical timing. I don't
know which is funnier - the degree to which this self-important and
well-seasoned Slavic prima donna becomes Azucena, or the degree to which she
doesn't.
A few Vera non-musical jokes should have gone years ago - the wheedling
Renata Scotto plea 'Forgive me my poor English,' and the unoriginal nickname
'Jess E Normous'. And, though Vera's incidentally spiteful remarks about
other sopranos are one of her most hilarious facets, her bitchiness is often
too laboured.
The most unnervingly comic aspect of her is her musicality - the Mad Scene
cadenza she inserts at just the right place into her pop song; the
longer-than-long phrase-lengths; the gutsy plunges into chest register; or
the relieved emergence from chest register. An evening with Vera
Galupe-Borszkh is a master-class in opera and its absurdity. You don't have
to know about opera to hear why Vera is funny - she herself is a
crash-course in the art.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Technology: Trouble after hours - Since its launch the
Globex trading system has provoked much criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is late in the afternoon and Chicago's futures trading floors are closed.
But high in an office tower on LaSalle street a futures trader-turned
computer operator is juggling his telephone and keying in a customer order
to sell D-Mark futures. His after-hours Globex terminal asks for account
information and a security code, then accepts the order.
In the intervening minute, the interbank foreign exchange trader at his
elbow has taken, priced and executed a telephone trade for a large quantity
of D-Marks in the over-the-counter market. Long after the telephone trade is
finished, the computer order glows on the Globex screen, unmatched.
Globex, the after-hours trading system for futures and options contracts
developed jointly by Reuters and the two largest futures exchanges, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, was conceived in
1987 as the high-tech weapon that would electronically project Chicago
futures trades around the clock and around the world. It was also designed
to blunt competition from overseas exchanges and turn a potential
off-exchange competitor - Reuters - into a partner.
Five years and an estimated Dollars 80m (Pounds 52m) later, its technology
had already been overtaken by the time it was launched in June 1992.
Globex's problems are rooted in both the conception and execution of the
service. 'Globex was conceived when the 24-hour global dealing desk was
envisaged - but that has never really happened,' said Tony La Roche,
managing director of Cater Allen Futures.
During the 1980s, 'globalisation' was a buzzword in the financial markets.
The concept was that as barriers between markets fell, trading would cease
to be concentrated in domestic markets, and would, at least in large markets
such as the US Treasury market, continue 24 hours a day with flows of paper
moving around the world.
Instead, trading has remained concentrated within the domestic timezone of
the relevant instrument. For example, the Japanese Government Bond market is
highly liquid during the Far Eastern trading day, but activity tails off
when that market closes.
Because Globex is a futures market, it is difficult for heavy volume to be
generated when the underlying cash market is closed. Futures contracts are
generic agreements to buy or sell at a set price and time through an
organised exchange. The only instruments listed on Globex which have liquid
cash markets around the clock are Eurodollar futures and foreign currencies.
So far, trading volume has been disappointing, although the recent listing
of products from the Matif, the French futures exchange, helped boost
volume. But the system is being used primarily as a means of finishing off
late trades in a particular marketplace, rather than for trading outside a
dealer's natural timezone. Even then, it is outclassed in speed and
liquidity by other after-market trading opportunities.
Its biggest competition comes from the Chicago exchanges. On any given
night, while the Globex terminals are live, eight times as many US
government bond futures contracts trade on the floor of the Chicago Board of
Trade, in sessions that coincide with Japan's market opening.
After the closing bell at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 5,000 to 10,000
telephone trades in after-hours Japanese yen and D-Mark futures are done in
transactions known as 'exchange for physicals', many more than on Globex.
And in Singapore, while Chicago sleeps, 10 times more three-month Eurodollar
futures are traded on the Simex floor than on Globex. The Simex trades,
similar to those on Globex, can be offset by a floor trade in Chicago.
Liquid floor and telephone markets, meanwhile, have improved their own
technologies in the past six years. 'Globex is definitely the tail of the
market, and the tail won't wag the dog,' says Brian Duff, foreign exchange
product manager for Cargill Investors Services, a Chicago-based brokerage
house that staffs a Globex desk.
Most traders familiar with the system say it is not particularly
user-friendly. In London, it is compared unfavourably with the after-hours
system operated by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options
Exchange (Liffe). Liffe's APT system, which is currently the subject of a
development project, is liked by traders because it simulates the method of
trading used in the futures pits.
Globex is criticised for its time-consuming order-entry requirements,
despite the heavy investment in technology.
In a much-needed revival, the Matif doubled Globex volume since it began
entering its contracts on the system on March 15. But the boost from Matif
is purely local, as UK and US firms have been, to date, unable to trade the
French products for regulatory reasons. Ominously, the rise in Matif volume
on the system in April masked a decline in trades in CBoT and CME products.
Jack Sandner, the eight-time CME chairman who took the helm of Globex this
week, argues that building a truly international system takes time and
technical and regulatory hurdles are being overcome.
But international terminal placement is still sketchy; no other exchanges
besides the Matif have signed on to list products and technical hitches
still dog the system.
Reuters, which contributed most of the estimated Dollars 80m cost of
developing Globex, may find it hard to recoup its investment. Globex has cut
or waived fees on some deals, but Reuters earns Dollars 1 per round trade
and Dollars 800 in monthly rental for some 300 terminals installed.
At the heart of Globex's troubles are the exchanges' reservations about
screen-trading. 'We all really believe open outcry trading is the better
way,' says Alger 'Duke' Chapman, chairman of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. 'It is cheaper and more efficient, with higher bid/ask spreads,
than any computer system in the world.'
Global screen-based trading may have its day. But Globex is likely to go
down in history as one of a number of prototypes, before the final
technological breakthrough which makes screen-trading as easy as
face-to-face trading.

FT  03 JUN 93 / People: Inland Revenue hires critic as tax practice watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue has made a daring choice in hiring Elizabeth Filkin as
its independent adjudicator to deal with complaints from taxpayers.
It can expect little respite from her once she starts work on July 1. She
was chief executive from 1983 to 1988 of the National Association of
Citizen's Advice Bureaux, an organisation which has been critical of Revenue
in the past.
But Filkin stressed yesterday she would approach the job with an open mind.
'I come with a chunk of knowledge but not any preconceived views or
assumptions. I believe the hearts of the Revenue professionals are in the
right place.'
The Revenue selected her in open competition from more than 700 applicants.
'I have always been interested in consumer rights and justice. And the
Inland Revenue is the biggest business in Britain, with a turnover of Pounds
18bn a year,' she says.
'An organisation with 25 million phone calls a year and 400 outlets is going
to have bits that go wrong,' she says. 'It is vital that we can be confident
the tax system is administered as fairly and efficiently as possible and
that, when mistakes are made, they are rectified.'
Filkin, 52, has a broad portfolio of activities, ranging from chairing the
Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Committee and membership of the Advert-ising
Standards Authority.
She is a director of Hay Management Consultants, focusing on customer
service, and a non-executive director of the Britannia Building Society. She
was director of community services and then assistant chief executive of the
London Docklands Development Corporation between 1988 and 1992.
At the Citizen's Advice Bureaux, she set up a national internal complaints
procedure and co-ordinated the 1,000 bureaux nationwide.
The Revenue envisages the position will provide a last post of appeal to
deal with complaints in the way tax affairs are handled by its staff. Ms
Filkin will be paid Pounds 55,000 pro rata, and is currently expected to
work a three-day week.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Technology: Taking the soft option - Protecting the UK
coastline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NUALA MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's coastline is under threat. Not only do many of the country's sea
defences date from before 1939, but sea levels are rising through geological
changes and global warming.
To find better ways of protecting Britain's coastline from both erosion and
flooding, the national Coastal Research Facility has been set up. This large
tank - built to model the interactions of sea and shore - is the main
element of a five-year, Pounds 5m coastal engineering programme funded by
the Science and Engineering Research Council.
The tank, a joint venture with the contract group HR Wallingford in
Oxfordshire, will be able to model 800m stretches of coastline. Paul Meakin,
secretary of Serc's environmental civil engineering committee, says one of
the main results will be improved software for civil engineers who design
and build defences.
Britain has more than 17,000 miles of coastline, subject to the constant
attrition of the sea. It is difficult to get a true picture of the scale of
the threat because the last survey of flood and coastal defences was
completed in 1981, although the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
expects to finish its national survey of coastal defences by September.
With sea levels forecast to rise from 4mm a year on the Northumbrian coast
to 6mm in the south and east, there is no doubt that the UK needs to improve
its sea defences. But there is no consensus among researchers, engineers and
funding bodies about how to do so. It is already well recognised that 'hard'
defences will not solve Britain's serious coastal erosion problem. 'In fact,
sea walls do nothing to stop erosion - they protect the land behind them but
overall they reflect energy and cause the sea to take more material away,'
says Dick Thomas, consulting engineer at Posford Duvivier, maritime
engineering consultants.
He says rough, sloping sea walls are now acknowledged as the best way of
absorbing rather than reflecting the sea's energy, and walls of this type
have been built at Mablethorpe and Skegness in Lincolnshire.
Serc is also investigating alternative 'soft' defences. 'The aim is to find
ways of placing sand and shingle beaches and make sure they stay there,'
says Michael Owen, chairman of the Coastal Defence Research Committee, a
unit of Serc's environmental committee.
Beaches are often preferred to sea walls because they can absorb all the
wave energy. But they do take up more room. A typical sea wall 5m high may
need a strip 10m wide. A shingle beach 5m in height would typically have a
slope of 1:8, and a sand beach a slope of 1:20.
The difficulty of designing beaches is to predict what slope is needed for
different waves and tidal situations.
Beaches are also subject to drift and so need frequent maintenance. Despite
this, they are cheaper than walls, which typically cost around Pounds 5,000
per metre. For example, Owen estimates that in the long run the shingle
beach constructed at Seaford, near Newhaven, will cost 75 per cent of
building a sea wall. But in common with sea walls, beaches can have knock-on
effects. It is recognised that raising the height of the sand beach at
Bournemouth to cut down erosion has resulted in neighbouring beaches being
deprived of their natural source of recharge.
Another problem with building soft defences is finding the right materials.
Shingle is best because it absorbs most wave energy, but good shingle is
difficult to find, Owen points out.
The Construction Industry Research and Information Association is about to
start a Pounds 500,000 project on coastline protection and beach management
which will investigate this problem. 'The aim is to survey resources that
for one reason or another are not currently exploited,' says Judy Payne,
research manager in water engineering at Ciria.
Another approach, which according to Chris Birks, head of flood defence at
the National Rivers Authority is 'relatively novel in the UK', is the
construction of artificial reefs to protect the coast by reducing wave
energy. The NRA is constructing reefs 250m off the north Norfolk coast
consisting of layers of rock held in place with mesh.
The trend in coastal defences is towards soft engineering, Birks says. 'This
means working with the coastal processes and using nature against nature.'
The most fashionable example is strategic retreat. This means allowing the
sea to inundate existing sea walls and create a salt marsh, building a new
sea wall on higher ground.
The approach is favoured by the conservation body English Nature because it
will create important wildlife habitats and by the ministry because it is
much cheaper than building higher and higher sea walls.
No one advocates strategic retreat in areas where there is any risk to
property, but there is a feeling that it is pointless to protect marginal
farmland when farmers are being paid to take land out of production.
An experiment is taking place at Northey Island in Essex where the tide has
been allowed to flood over the old sea wall to begin creating a salt marsh
and a lower sea wall has been built on higher ground.
A 10m stretch of salt marsh offers the same protection as 1m on top of a sea
wall. But Alan Gray, head of population ecology and genetics at the
Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, says it is not just a matter of allowing
land to be flooded by seawater.
'Salt marshes need to be designed just as much as sea walls and beaches are.
It is essential to carry out tidal studies because there is a chance of
altering the balance between the ebb and flow of the tide so that sediments
are sucked out rather than being deposited.'
The life expectancy of a sea wall is 50 years - the same time it takes for a
mudflat to develop into a saltmarsh. So a managed retreat scheme would have
much longer life than a hard defence.
However, Dick Thomas is sceptical about building soft defences to replace
sea walls. 'Even if the sea wall has been undermined, with a bit of work it
will be as good as new. If you go to a softer defence you are sometimes
rejecting all existing assets.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / People: Wilkinson joins Laird Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Wilkinson, a former British Steel executive who has been running
his own business for the past 18 months, has joined The Laird Group, and
will be appointed finance director in July.
Wilkinson, 47, who is reluctant to discuss his experience at Prior
Wilkinson, a partnership he set up in October 1991 together with David
Prior, son of Lord Prior, describes Laird as 'a very good opportunity'.
Wilkinson replaces Charles Barton, finance director for the past two years,
who announced his resignation at the end of May. At the time, Laird chairman
and chief executive John Gardiner explained that Barton had 'decided to
develop his career outside Laird'.
A graduate of the LSE and Stanford, Wilkinson first became acquainted with
Laird when he worked for the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation 20 years
ago. His next move was to British Steel. There, he became chief economist in
1978, later financial controller of an operating group, and then head of the
corporate mergers, investments and divestments team.
He and Prior then briefly worked for Garry Klesch of Quadrex Securities.
Klesch put up the equity for a series of steel service sector buy-ins.
Wilkinson moved again, this time to Dillon Reed, but he left when Barings
bought into Dillon Reed and the London office was reorganised.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bridging the divide
 -Doing business in Japan is bound up in ritual and customs. Walter Bruderer
offers a 10-point guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER BRUDERER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your company is planning to do business in Japan for the first time,
prepare for a shock. Modern, high-tech and sophisticated it may seem; but in
many respects it remains an old-fashioned country, clinging to ancient
business practices and bound by traditions that mystify outsiders.
After 10 years of living in Japan, I have found 10 keys to getting off to a
good start:
Establishing a good relationship. The Japanese tend to be rather formal in
the rituals of beginning a relationship with a foreigner. It is a slow
process - the introduction, exchange of business cards, the gradual
beginning of business talks, drawn-out decision-making.
The Japanese believe this is a judicious way to launch a long-lasting
business relationship. Most Japanese expect to remain with one employer for
life. If they choose to do business with you, they expect the friendship to
generate loyalty on both sides and endure into the future.
Such a valuable business relationship requires careful cultivation - sales
calls, courtesy visits, perhaps an occasional lunch or other social event.
Describing your organisation. Besides wanting to get to know you, the
Japanese believe getting to know your organisation in some detail is time
well spent.
On your first visit your host will welcome pamphlets, brochures, anything
that describes your organisation, where it operates, what it sells and what
you hope to accomplish in Japan. These may have been published originally in
English or another language, but it would be courteous to have the main
points printed on a separate piece of paper in Japanese and inserted in each
document.
Meetings. For a first meeting, try to get a mutual acquaintance to introduce
you by letter or telephone. The Japanese are accustomed to this. Request a
time for your appointment and, once made, don't change it. This demonstrates
that you respect the other person's time and that you are reliable and well
organised. Do not make so many appointments for the day that you have to
rush. Tokyo and Osaka are enormous cities, so make allowances for traffic
delays that could disrupt a schedule.
Bring a small gift for your Japanese counterpart. A good choice is a modest
novelty item made in your country. A bad choice is an item from your firm,
which is viewed as a paltry giveaway and not as a gift.
Knowing how decisions are made. Decisions in Japan are usually made by
middle management, not by the president or chief executive officer.
When you first call on a firm, you may meet the president, but only to
exchange greetings. With that formality out of the way, you will make your
proposal at a lower level, probably to the head of a department or division.
Waiting for a 'yes' or 'no'. If you are accustomed to a prompt 'yes' or 'no'
after making your sales pitch to a prospect, the deliberate decision-making
of the Japanese may shock your sensibilities and shake your ego.
No matter how attractive your product, how thorough and convincing your
presentation, how flexible and accommodating your position, do not expect to
come away from your first meeting with a 'yes' or 'no'. The Japanese will
assure you that they will consider the matter and see what action can be
taken.
It is partly a matter of courtesy - not offending you as a foreigner with a
hasty 'no'. It is also a matter of the Japanese wanting time to evaluate
your proposal, your organisation and you personally. They anticipate a long,
loyal relationship and this rules out precipitate action.
This is the way of doing things in Japan. And, once the decision is made, it
will usually be final and carried out expeditiously because the middle
manager has consulted everyone, effectively cutting off further dissent.
Being patient, patient, patient. Traditions, customs, rituals are evident
everywhere in the Japanese way of conducting business. They have a tendency
to slow things down. But they add a certain charm and tend to venerate
long-lasting, loyal relationships.
The best virtue you can display in the face of traditions is patience. It
may be the key to your success in Japan.
Using the Japanese language. You would be wise to use Japanese in sales
materials and every kind of promotional effort.
Using the language helps give you the look of belonging and you increase
your chances of reaching and persuading the Japanese by using their
language.
To make sure no misleading or offensive nuances find their way into your
copy, hire a native-born writer to translate your copy into Japanese.
If you cannot escape using English instead of Japanese, be warned this will
do some measure of damage to your image as a newcomer to Japan.
Speaking English. For all practical purposes the Japanese are not fluent in
English. But they are not total strangers to the language and many have a
limited vocabulary.
If you have to use English, speak slowly; use simple words and sentences; be
direct and uncomplicated; write down key words and numbers and display them
in a meeting. If you can at least learn some common Japanese expressions,
the Japanese will admire your effort to fit in. Even a meagre vocabulary
will help you catch the meaning and flavour of what is being said.
While language at first appears to be a significant barrier, it is not an
insoluble problem. When there is a lot at stake it is remarkable how a way
can be found if both sides make the effort.
Adopting a moderate approach. The Japanese prefer your sales efforts to be
in keeping with their customary pace - moderate, low-key, deliberate.
In this unhurried atmosphere, the Japanese view the hard-driving,
argumentative, slam-bang type of presentation as self-centred, ostentatious
and confrontational. It is the wrong way to nurture a relationship.
The Japanese have as much competitive fire as anyone. But they believe a
moderate manner works best for them, as it therefore will for you as well.
Dressing. In Japanese offices, individuals rarely wear clothing that makes
them stand out. They favour plain, conservative dress. So should you. You
are better off blending in quietly than loudly standing out.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Better service or
your money back - Cash compensation schemes have become popular, despite
initial scepticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Major, the UK prime minister, launched the idea of a Citizen's
Charter in March 1991 to raise the standard of public services, politicians,
commentators and civil servants were deeply sceptical of the project. Some
of the greatest reservations were expressed over Major's desire to pay
customers compensation when services fail to come up to scratch.
Money paid out to dissatisfied customers was money which could not be spent
on improving services, the sceptics argued. Compensation payments to some
customers meant worse service for all customers when budgets were
constrained by tight cash limits, the argument went.
However, many organisations have found that cash compensation schemes offer
a relatively cost-effective marketing tool. Apart from providing balm to
soothe the wounds of dissatisfied customers, they also symbolise the
organisation's desire to respond to consumer concerns.
Creating such schemes can help identify sources of customer dissatisfaction
and provide incentives for managers to meet customer satisfaction targets.
The idea of providing cash compensation has been widely taken up by the
privatised utilities, often at the insistence of their regulators. Water and
electricity companies, British Gas and BT all offer small sums (typically
Pounds 10 or Pounds 20) to customers for failure to keep appointments and
for prolonged loss of service.
The pioneer of such schemes was East Midlands Electricity which, even before
privatisation, offered its 2.2m customers Pounds 10 if the company failed to
keep an appointment.
'Our market research told us that we weren't trusted by our customers,' says
Nick Akers, East Midlands' corporate relations manager.
'We had a reputation of saying we'd come on Wednesday and turning up on
Thursday.'
The scheme certainly appears to have been successful in improving the
company's image, giving it higher satisfaction ratings than other utilities
in the area.
Providing such compensation has been relatively inexpensive. With 99.74 per
cent of appointments kept, less than Pounds 35,000 was paid out in the nine
months to the end of March 1992.
'It provides an internal discipline for the company itself,' says Akers.
'Staff know that they are expected to meet customer service targets, so the
company ends up paying out very little.'
The scheme has been extended since its launch in 1985 and now covers 16
different service targets. Customers can ask for calls to be within a
two-hour time slot or even at a specific time if they prefer. And the basic
payment has been raised to Pounds 20.
Other public services have followed the utilities' lead in implementing the
Citizen's Charter. The Benefits Agency, for example, paid out more than
Pounds 1m last year for excessive delays in settling claims for social
security benefits and pensions. British Rail spent an estimated Pounds 3m
last year on compensating passengers for delayed and cancelled trains.
Local councils have also introduced a variety of compensation schemes.
Torfaen in Wales pays tenants Pounds 10 for breaches of its housing
department customer service guarantee. The London borough of Islington gives
free entry vouchers to people using its swimming pools if the water is dirty
or not warm enough.
Fashionable though compensation schemes have become, care is needed in
devising them if they are to improve the organisation's standing, says Sue
Bloomfield of the Consumers Association.
'It's a good way of acknowledging that your customers have rights,' she
says. 'But most consumers would rather have a good value-for-money service.'
Gareth Jones, research director of the customer service consultancy BEM,
warns it is important to find out what it is the consumer feels is
important.
'People think that service guarantees are a good idea,' he says, 'so long as
they apply to things that are important. They are not impressed with
guarantees of things they take for granted, such as hygiene or safety.'
But at least as important as offering redress to dissatisfied customers is
the aim of using cash compensation schemes as a management tool for focusing
on customer service, says Brian Hilton, head of the Cabinet Office Citizen's
Charter Unit.
'The amount of compensation paid out in different parts of an organisation
is a good indicator of how well each part is meeting its individual customer
service targets,' he says.
'Top management should use this information to identify and improve weak
areas, reward good performance and thus reduce the need to pay compensation
at all.'
This approach is well illustrated by London Underground, which links
managers' performance pay to the amount of compensation paid out under its
Customer Charter in their part of the business. With a real incentive to
meet customer service targets, they ensured that London Underground paid out
less than Pounds 70,000 in compensation last year and hit or comfortably
exceeded all its service targets.
'Our Customer Charter is all about delivering a service that makes refunds
an exception rather than a rule,' says Denis Tunnicliffe, London
Underground's managing director.
And that provides the answer to those who worry that cash compensation
schemes mean less to spend on improving services.
A well-structured scheme should focus the organisation more tightly on
service performance targets in such a way as to ensure that customers only
rarely need to claim a payment.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: 'True and fair view' still defies
precise definition / A look at the background to the most powerful and
evocative phrase in accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a phrase in accountancy just a few words long, which wields
tremendous - almost religious - power and yet defies precise definition. A
new publication from the Accounting Standards Board this week has vested it
with extra authority. It is 'a true and fair view'.
Everyone cites it. Few accountants would be willing to sacrifice it. But
attempts to get people to define what it means lead only to a sharp intake
of breath and a marked silence.
True and fair has a long history and considerable current significance. It
appears in company legislation. It crops up in the audit reports attached to
British company accounts. It is used to justify deviations from existing
rules. It is the ultimate invocation of the high priests of accountancy, a
mantra used to explain unusual practices, an elusive concept shrouded in
mystique and removed from the sullying influence of the dirty day-to-day
practicality of accounting standards.
'True and fair is the foundation of contemporary accounting practice,' says
Mr Michael Fowle, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'It doesn't have a
meaning which is precise, but you know when you see something that is
untrue. It would be difficult in a debate with a client without it, when you
just have a feeling in your waters that something isn't right.'
But it is also a phrase open to considerable abuse. As Christopher Nobes,
professor of accounting at the University of Reading, sceptically suggests,
the use of the phrase 'to present more fairly' in the notes to accounts when
diverging from standards is often a clear indication of the complete
opposite - that something shady is going on.
'True and fair' has been given new relevance with a legal opinion by Ms Mary
Arden, QC, now a judge, published today as an appendix to the Accounting
Standards Board's draft 'Foreword to accounting standards'.
The Arden opinion is one of the few instances in which lawyers have
encroached into the sacrosanct territory of the accountants. The previous
example was a similar joint opinion produced by her and Mr Leonard Hoffmann
 -now also a judge - in 1983, and supplemented a year later.
The new version is a delight to the ears of Mr David Tweedie, chairman of
the board. He believes that it invests him with a new-found authority. 'It
is a great leap forward,' he says. 'Before we could not move.'
The original Hoffmann and Arden opinion cast doubt on how far the Accounting
Standards Committee - the board's predecessor - and the statements of
standard accounting practice it produced would be heeded in the courts when
considering the 'true and fair view' required by company legislation.
In the subsequent decade, Mary Arden argues that there has been considerable
change. She cites the single court case which has touched on the topic -
Lloyd Cheyham v Littlejohn - which vested the old committee with credibility
in the eyes of the judge, Mr Justice Woolf.
She argues that the wider funding and membership of the Accounting Standards
Board compared with the committee - which was essentially controlled by the
accountancy profession - will add to the legitimacy of its standards in the
eyes of the court.
That may be good news for David Tweedie, but it does little to enlighten the
uninitiated. In good folksy tradition, stories abound over the sacred
phrase. An oft-told tale relates how the captain of a ship, exasperated by
the fondness of his first mate for the bottle, wrote in the log 'the mate
was drunk last night'. To which the mate appended, nursing his morning
hangover, 'the captain was sober today' - a true but hardly fair statement.
In a speech 10 years ago, David Flint, an academic, called the phrase 'at
the lowest level of its utility, a safety valve, protecting users from bias,
inadequacy or deficiency in the rules; a fail-safe device for the
unavoidable shortcomings of prescription. Its real utility is in
establishing an enduring conceptual standard . . . to ensure that there is
always relevant disclosure based on independent professional judgment.'
Yet the phrase, just like the issue of audit negligence, remains all but
untested legally, let alone satisfactorily described by commentators. It
remains an elusive rainbow - a beautiful concept, but one which is difficult
to describe and impossible to touch. It has been aptly dubbed 'a term of
art'. Mr Fowle says he would love to see it debated in the courts. 'I just
wish all the other firms would create the case law.'
Mary Arden herself says the phrase is 'a dynamic concept . . . subject to
continuous rebirth'. As a special edition of the European Accounting Review
out this month shows, 'true and fair' is neither as long-standing over time
or as wide-ranging over space as might at first be believed.
Peter Walton from the London School of Economics, shows that 'true and fair'
was only introduced in the 1947 Companies Act. The 1844 Joint Stock
Companies Act first called for a 'full and fair' balance sheet, and the 1879
Companies Act for auditors to state whether it gave a 'full and correct'
view.
It was British pressure that introduced the concept into the EC's fourth
directive, so that the final version in 1978 requires a true and fair view
of the company's assets, liabilities, financial position and results.
As other papers in the journal show, how this phrase is translated, let
alone interpreted, in the different EC countries, varies widely. It has been
in place since 1984 as image fidele in France, for example, but with no
discernible impact. In Britain, 'true and fair' is what British accountants
declare it to be, but in the EC, it will be whatever the European Court
decides, warns one German writer.
Mr Fowle cites a case of a company which translated its borrowings in Brazil
'wrongly' over several years but in line with accounting standards. He
permitted it to continue until the sum rose to 15 per cent of profits, at
which point he threatened to qualify the accounts unless the practice was
changed.
The difficulty is that for every such case during the 1980s, there were many
more in which clients were able to defy - or even be assisted by - their
auditors in interpreting standards strictly by the letter and not by the
spirit of 'true and fair'.
As Mr Chris Swinson, a partner with Stoy Hayward, says: 'I feel very
uncomfortable with a concept that people find useful in practice but is
difficult to define. The impression it gives of absolute truth is not
helpful. I have always liked the New World phrase 'presents fairly'
instead.'
'True and fair' offers a false sense of security to users of accounts, and a
way for accountants to justify their own privileged professional position.
That is not to say a thick US-style 'rulebook' - the alternative threatened
by Mr Tweedie - would be any better.
Legal opinions like Mary Arden's have their uses, but they also have
limitations. A recent one by Mr Richard Sykes for Touche Ross over Trafalgar
House's reclassification of assets did nothing to prevent the company being
reprimanded by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, for instance.
At the moment, the board has a fragile legitimacy for 'true and fair' in law
which does little to raise it above a meaningless mantra. If it reaches the
courts, the board had better hope the case goes to the sympathetic ears of
Mrs Justice Arden and Lords Hoffmann and Woolf in the House of Lords on
appeal.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Business levy urged for rail projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEVY on London businesses could help finance transport investment in
CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension to Docklands and other rail and
Underground projects, says London First, the business-led initiative set up
last year to promote strategic thinking about the capital.
The proposal has been prepared by London First's 16-strong transport group,
which is chaired by Mr Peter Foy, the senior partner of management
consultants McKinsey.
The Department of Transport last night described the proposal as
'interesting and deserving of further consideration'.
London First estimates that more than Pounds 17bn will be needed over the
next 10 years to fund the renewal of London's rail and Underground systems
and to finance new projects. Current government investment plans will
provide only 50 per cent of what is needed over the next five years.
The group's proposal involves creating an organisation, called the London
Transport Funding Trust, to top up government funds. It would draw its
income from a levy on businesses - perhaps through an addition to the
uniform business rate. The trust would raise capital for transport
investment by issuing bonds, servicing the debt from the levy.
Mr Foy said: 'A 1p increase in the business rate would raise over Pounds
100m, enough to support approximately Pounds 1bn in bonds. We feel that this
is a big enough sum to make a difference to investment in London
infrastructure and small enough not to scare off the private sector.'
The trust would be majority-owned by the private sector, and run by a board
to represent London businesses. Its borrowing would therefore be outside the
public sector borrowing requirement, which the government is struggling to
constrain. The new funds would provide the private sector with a leadership
role in transport investment, according to Mr Foy. It would provide a
catalyst for ensuring the timely implementation of priority investments, he
said.
Mr Foy believes that business would support such a levy if the government
committed itself to a long-term agreed investment programme to upgrade the
capital's infrastructure.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Nissan chief joins car lobby executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN GIBSON, chief executive of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is to
join the executive committee of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, the main UK motor trade association.
This paves the way for his possible election to president of the society,
the first time that the UK industry would be led by a senior executive of a
Japanese manufacturer.
The emergence of Nissan in the higher echelons of the main lobbying
organisation of the British motor industry is likely to prove controversial
among west European car producers, which are campaigning for a tight
monitoring regime for Japanese vehicle exports to the European Community.
France and Italy in particular insist production from Japanese plants in the
UK should be taken into account when the EC and Tokyo negotiate the level of
direct Japanese vehicle exports to Europe. The UK government says that there
should be no limit on Japanese vehicle production in Europe and that output
from Japanese plants in Europe must have free circulation in the EC.
Nissan, Honda and Toyota have all located their first European car plants in
the UK.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain and a public critic of
Japanese involvement in the European motor industry, is to become a
vice-president of the society at its annual meeting next week.
In evidence to MPs earlier this year Mr McAllister attacked the 'extremely
low levels of engineering and manufacturing integration' of the Japanese
transplant assembly facilities in Britain. He said Ford was concerned about
the 'potential erosion of the UK's manufacturing and technological base
which could result from excessive reliance on Japanese transplant
factories'.
He added: 'Besides creating excess capacity which, given a market of finite
size, is likely to displace equivalent jobs in existing producers, and
having generally lower local content levels, which displaces jobs at both
manufacturers and suppliers, their products and components are wholly
designed and developed in Japan and must give rise to real concerns for the
UK's technological base.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Accounts board warns on rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES MUST obey the spirit and reasoning of the new accounting standards
in almost every circumstance if their accounts are to comply with the law,
according to draft documents issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards
Board.
Members of UK accounting bodies who are directors or officers of companies
are also required to ensure their fellow officers understand the
significance of the drafts, it says.
The details come in two documents which stress that the standards issued by
the board and its urgent-issues task force are underpinned in law. They
include a legal opinion from Ms Mary Arden, a senior commercial barrister
recently appointed a judge, who says the courts are likely to accept the
guidelines.
That view gives significant new authority to the board compared with its
predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee. Mr David Tweedie, chairman
of the board, said: 'This is a great leap forward. Before we could not
move.'
A separate foreword says abstracts from the board's urgent-issues task force
are part of the standards which help meet the requirement in law that
accounts show 'a true and fair view'.
The forward also says that companies should adopt the standards as soon as
possible.
It stresses that there will normally be no scope for 'grandfathering' of
transactions - by which companies can exempt transactions from new standards
if they took place before the standards were introduced.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Draft puts greater onus on principal auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCIPAL auditors to companies must ensure that they are satisfied with
the adequacy of work carried out by other auditors used during an audit,
under draft guidelines issued yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board.
The quality of work must be considered when using affiliates, correspondent
firms and unrelated firms in the UK or overseas.
Auditors must consider the 'materiality of the statements they audit' to the
group accounts, their knowledge of the business and their relationship with
affiliated firms before accepting appointment as principal auditors, it
says.
The details come in SAS 510 on the relationship between principal and other
auditors, one of five draft standards issued yesterday by the board.
Mr John Hennessy, of accountants Arthur Andersen, who is a member of the
board, said: 'This is just a matter, we hope, of putting what is sensible
good practice down on to paper.'
SAS 100, the statement on objective and general principles, says auditors
should comply with auditing standards, and obtain sufficient evidence to
determine whether the statements are free of material misstatement and
prepared in accordance with legislation and accounting standards.
SAS 470, on the review of financial statements, says auditors must consider
whether the presentation of accounts has been unduly influenced by
management's desire to present facts in a favourable or unfavourable light,
and the effects of the aggregation of uncorrected misstatements.
SAS 500, on the work of internal audit, for the first time places an
obligation on auditors to look at the activities of internal audit and the
effect on external audit, and to liaise with the internal auditors.
The board has invited comments on the drafts by the end of September, and
will publish a collection of draft standards by the end of October.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Scottish utility in Dover contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYDRO-ELECTRIC, the Scottish electricity company, yesterday announced an
innovative deal to sell power directly to Dover Harbour Board from a
combined heat and power plant.
The utility is to lay a cable across Dover between the Pounds 7.25m plant
which it is building with Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, and the harbour.
The plant is Hydro-Electric's first outside Scotland. Dover Harbour Board
has signed a 10-year contract to take surplus electricity from the mill for
the port's eastern docks. Hydro-Electric intends to sell any remaining power
to Seeboard, the local electricity company.
Mr David Sigsworth, head of energy trading, said he believed it would be the
first time an electricity company operating outside its area had laid a
cable from a CHP plant across a town, avoiding use of the local distribution
network.
He said another unusual feature of the plan was that Arjo would avoid paying
the nuclear levy on its share of the electricity from the project. Usually a
company is exempt only if it takes more than 51 per cent of the power from a
combined heat and power plant.
The exemption has been allowed because the 9MW plant has two installations,
one owned by Hydro and the other by Arjo, so the 51 per cent rule applies to
only half the plant.
The plant is expected to become fully operational in April next year. It has
been designed to increase efficiency, improve environmental impact and
reduce costs at the paper mill and will enable Hydro to sell more power
outside its core area.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Pride suspended over the Tyne
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the campaign to save the troubled Swan Hunter shipyard hope the
launch today of a Pounds 1.4m ferry will not be the last in the company's
130-year history.
The Pride of the Tyne (above) was the last vessel order received before Swan
Hunter went into receivership after failing to win a helicopter carrier
contract three weeks ago.
The 25m ferry, built for the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive,
was small enough to be lowered into the water by crane.
Many of the 1,800 workers remaining at the yard are mainly employed in
fitting out three frigates.
Talks between the receivership team and the Ministry of Defence have so far
guaranteed work on the frigates only up to the end of next week.
However, further negotiations could result in the ships being completed at
the yard.

3.6m visitors entering the country, figures released yesterday by the
British Tourist Authority show.
Tourist spending was also at record levels, up 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Visitor numbers were 8 per cent up from last year.
The increases were achieved in spite of a fall in the number of North
American visitors. Visits by North Americans fell 6 per cent to 600,000 in
the first quarter. The number of visitors from western Europe rose 12 per
cent to 2.3m - higher than in any previous first quarter.
Mr Dick Batchelor, the authority's assistant marketing director, said
blizzards on the US east coast in March had hampered efforts to attract
American visitors.
He said that much of the euphoria following the election of President
Clinton had subsided and many Americans were less optimistic about their
economic prospects. This was particularly true of the authority's target
market, the top 10 per cent of earners.
Mr Batchelor said many potential US visitors had not yet realised that
sterling's depreciation had made holidays in the UK cheaper. Some in the UK
tourist industry have criticised the authority for not giving greater
publicity to the pound's weakness.
Detailed figures on western European visitors are not yet available but Mr
Batchelor said that the Spanish and Italian markets seemed particularly
healthy. The authority would be happy to see a small rise in the number of
visitors from Germany, given the downturn in the German economy.

FT  03 JUN 93 / British Steel increases prices again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL yesterday announced its third round of price increases this
year.
The company is raising the list price of steel tubes by an average of 7 per
cent from July 4. Steel tubes are used in a range of construction and
manufacturing processes.
The increase is a result of higher raw material prices previously announced
by British Steel, which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m in the six months
to the end of September. Analysts have forecast that losses for the year to
the end of March are likely to have been more than Pounds 100m.
Prices of hot-rolled coil steel, used to make steel tubes, were raised by
British Steel in January and again in April.
The company said it had no choice but to increase its prices if it was to
make an adequate return from its business.
British Steel said that prices of many of its products were still well below
peak levels of 1990, even after the latest increases. The fall in the value
of sterling has made it easier for the company to make increases stick.
Exporters of steel to Britain, faced with a decline in the value of their
exports, so far appear unwilling to undercut British Steel prices.
The company, in addition to raising the price of hot-rolled coil steel, also
announced increases in list prices of steel plate and section in January and
again in April this year.
British Steel said that the increases had generally been accepted by its
customers.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Surrey tops affluence table despite recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL FIGURES today show that Surrey was still living up to its image of
commuter-belt affluence when recession hit at the start of the decade.
The latest edition of Economic Trends from the Central Statistical Office
shows household income per head in 1990 was estimated to have been higher in
Surrey than anywhere else in the country. At Pounds 11,300 it was 37 per
cent higher than the UK average.
The Welsh county of mid-Glamorgan had the lowest household income per head
of Pounds 6,400.
The only other county to come close to Surrey was Hampshire, where per
capita income was Pounds 10,129. Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, and
Merseyside joined mid-Glamorgan at the bottom of the pile.
The figures confirm that in spite of recession in the south-east in the
early part of the decade wealth remained concentrated in London and the home
counties.
A breakdown by region shows that in 1991 personal incomes per head were
about 25 per cent higher in Greater London than the average for the rest of
the country.
By region, total personal annual income per head was highest in Greater
London at Pounds 11,151 and lowest in Northern Ireland at Pounds 7,327.
Although personal incomes were low in Wales between 1988 and 1991, consumer
expenditure per head rose steadily compared with the UK average. The
south-east experienced a relative decline over the same period.
Consumer spending per head was highest in Greater London in 1991, reaching
nearly Pounds 8,000 compared with less than Pounds 5,500 in the north of
England.
Food, drink and tobacco accounted for 24 per cent of consumer spending in
the north and the Yorkshire region, compared with only 19 per cent in
Greater London. It was highest in Scotland, where it accounted for 25 per
cent of consumer spending.
Spending on housing and fuel was highest in the south-west and west
Midlands, accounting for 20 per cent of consumer spending. It was lowest in
Scotland at 14 per cent.
Overall, the south-east, with only 30 per cent of the population, accounted
for more than 35 per cent of personal income.
Income from employment accounted for 60 per cent of total household income
in the south-east, compared with 53 per cent in Wales and the south-west.
Social security benefits were 12 per cent of household income in Northern
Ireland compared with 6 per cent for the rest of the UK.
The lowest benefit figures were found in East Anglia, the south-east and the
south-west - although the last recorded 17 per cent of income from
occupational and state pensions.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Societies criticised on women directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies were yesterday told by their regulatory body that their
record on appointing women directors was among the worst in British
industry, John Gapper writes.
The 87 societies were told at their annual conference in Brighton that the
Building Societies Commission had found that fewer than 3 per cent of
directors and 'hardly any' senior executives were women.
Mr Terry Matthews, a commissioner, told societies they were 'overlooking a
great many talented and able people, particularly internally, who have a
great deal to offer.'
Mr Matthews said the cultural problem in the industry was illustrated by the
experience of a woman director at a recent conference. During the coffee
break male society executives assumed she was a waitress.
The most prominent woman in the industry is Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, the
chairman of the Building Societies Commission, who is due to address the
conference today.
Mr Matthews said he thought many societies were trying to recruit women
directors. The commission was working on guidelines for corporate governance
of societies similar to the Cadbury Code of practice for companies with
shareholders.
He suggested that the commission might try to restrict directors or senior
executives from participating in share option schemes of their societies'
subsidiaries.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Fall feared in mortgage applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in the number of young people applying for mortgages later this
decade was predicted yesterday, following the publication of research on how
attitudes have been affected by falls in property prices in the past three
years.
The Building Societies Association disclosed internal research showing a
fall in the number of people aged between 16 and 34 who regard
owner-occupation within two years as their ideal, and a substantial rise in
those favouring private rented homes.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general designate of the BSA, told its annual
conference in Brighton that the change in attitude, combined with a fall in
the number of people in their mid-20s, could lead to 'a very significant
reduction' in mortgage applications.
Mr Coles said the change was not surprising. 'It is younger people who will
have obtained relatively large mortgages in the late 1980s, found high
interest rates most difficult to cope with, and have been or are likely to
be frustrated movers,' he said.
He said that the average age of entry to owner-occupation could rise by
three or four years, and this could lead to 'a difficult three or four years
in the marketplace while the average age is increasing'.
Mr Coles emphasised, however, that the research, which was carried out in
February and March among 2,500 people, had shown that the overall proportion
favouring owner-occupation within two years had recovered to its peak 1989
level of 81 per cent after falling to 77 per cent in 1991.
The proportion of 16 to 24 year olds favouring owner-occupation within two
years fell from 79 per cent in 1989 to 60 per cent in 1991 and only partly
recovered to 71 per cent by this year. Among 25 to 34 year olds it fell from
89 per cent to 83 per cent before recovering to 84 per cent.
Mr Coles said that the views of younger people were 'unfortunately' more
influential than those of the elderly in determining the housing market
because they moved more frequently and were more likely to become first-time
buyers.
The study found a large rise in the proportion of young people favouring
rented accommodation. In 1989 only 4 per cent of 20 to 24 year olds aspired
to this, but the proportion more than doubled to 11 per cent this year.
Mr Coles said many young people had been put off owner-occupation because
there was no longer a prospect of increases in house prices sharp enough to
cover the transaction costs of moving home.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said the prospect of a fall in
the number of first-time buyers in the late 1990s meant that the government
should not take measures which would stifle housing demand excessively.

FT  03 JUN 93 / School heads jeer and hiss speech by Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN BEFORE he stood to speak Mr John Patten, the education secretary, knew
he was in for a rough ride.
Mrs Pat Partington, president of the National Association of Head Teachers,
drew a round of applause when she said it had become 'almost an unusual
event' for an education secretary to attend the conference of the
association, which represents 31,500 heads and deputy heads in England and
Wales.
There was further applause from the 420 delegates when she told Mr Patten:
'We believe that many of the things that you are doing are wrong, unworkable
and not properly thought out.'
The first shouts of 'rubbish' came as Mr Patten defended his plans for
national curriculum testing in English and Welsh schools this year, which
are being boycotted by the three largest teachers unions.
To abandon testing, he said, 'would leave parents, teachers and the wider
community in the dark about our schools and how they are performing'.
The reaction provoked Mr Patten into an unscripted remark that the tests
were needed in open society. This was greeted by further jeers from the head
teachers.
The barracking continued at a more muffled level while Mr Patten announced a
minor concession - next year's secondary school tests in England and Wales
will be moved forward from June to May.
There was derisive laughter when Mr Patten announced that he had said all he
wanted to say about testing.
Mr Patten then diverted from his script. He launched a defence of league
tables of school results accompanied by growing laughter.
Another shout of 'rubbish' greeted his assertion that 'without a testing
regime and the publication of results, then neither government, taxpayers
nor the wider community will have any idea what's happening in schools'.
When Mr Patten spoke on teacher training there were more muffled jeers, but
there was handclapping when he assured them: 'We shall want to listen to
what you say.'
He commented: 'I bet that bit's not on television tonight - someone
applauding a secretary of state.'
There was muted applause for a few seconds as Mr Patten resumed his seat.
But he could not leave before Mrs Partington, head of a Nottinghamshire
primary school, had administered another rebuke. 'We did not hear the
message which will enable us to go back to our schools with optimism. Where
there should be optimism I feel foreboding.'
Shouts of 'Shame' greeted her announcement that Mr Patten would not take
questions and Mr Patten left the hall to loud hissing.
Delegates praised Mrs Partington as they left. 'She really destroyed him,
that was beautiful, really fantastic,' said one headmistress.
Afterwards Mr Patten said he was 'very sorry' to have received such a
reception. 'I came here to make a major speech to the NAHT conference on
teacher training.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / ITC to reopen Channel 5 debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission plans to reopen the debate about the
future of Channel 5 next month with the publication of a report setting out
a range of options.
The idea of a fifth national television channel appeared to die in December,
when the ITC rejected the only bidder, a consortium led by Thames
Television.
The ITC said that it was not satisfied with the consortium's business plan
nor its level of 'investor commitment.'
For the past few months ITC engineers have been reconsidering the technical
possibilities for a fifth channel. The commission believes that a new
channel is still a distinct possibility.
The most expensive stumbling block to last year's proposal was the fact that
the Channel 5 signal would have caused interference to millions of video
recorders.
The first of three main options outlined by the report would reduce the need
to retune video recorders by proposing extra frequencies for the channel.
The second option suggests using frequencies once considered for a sixth
television channel to set up a series of city-based television stations.
That option would require legislation as the 1990 Broadcasting Act provides
for a national Channel 5.
The third main option is receiving increasing attention. It suggests using
the Channel 5 frequencies to launch digital television in the UK. Using
digital technology at least four channels can be squeezed into the space now
occupied by one.
That could, at least in theory, allow the creation of several new services
or could be used to launch wider screen television, although viewers would
need a special box to convert the signal.
The ITC plans to invite comments on the options and call for expressions of
interest, and may re-advertise the channel before the end of this year or
early next year.

THE FOREMAN of the jury that found four men guilty of the 1978 murder of
Carl Bridgewater said yesterday he now believed they were innocent.
Mr Tim O'Malley said on ITN: 'At the time I thought we had done the right

a terrible miscarriage of justice which must be put right for those men and

THE UK's gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 78m in May,
the Treasury announced yesterday, Emma Tucker writes.
The overall level rose by Dollars 71m taking reserves at the end of the
month to Dollars 41.7bn compared with Dollars 41.6bn at the end of April.
The underlying change in the reserves excluded a number of factors such as
proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu Treasury bills and sales into
the secondary market. These amounted to Dollars 1.17bn.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Green shoots leave advertising rueful: Gillian Tett reads
the ambiguous signs of recovery among Britain's daily newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ADVERTISEMENTS for cars and travel
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
rather than jobs and houses - are giving grounds for optimism in the
newspaper advertising market, which is generally flat in spite of hopes of a
consumer-led recovery from recession.
After two disastrous years which saw national press advertising revenue fall
by almost a quarter, the industry is wary of predicting a false dawn - not
least because the differing fortunes of Britain's 11 daily newspapers and
the types of advertising they are winning reflect the different impact the
recovery is having on advertising sectors.
Although overall advertising revenues remain dramatically down, the signs
are that some titles and sectors are showing a glimmer of recovery.
In the past three months advertising revenue at the Daily Mail, which has
the largest volume of display advertising, has been 12 per cent higher than
during the same period last year. At The Daily Telegraph, the quality paper
with the most display advertising, revenue for April and May has been 23 per
cent and 11 per cent higher, year on year.
Mr Len Sanderson, advertising director of the Daily Telegraph, said: 'I am
still cautious, but we have had some encouraging months.' It will take
several months of growth before he is confident that these 'green shoots'
are genuine.
The caution seems wise, given the erratic nature of the industry's
performance in the past year.
The Times said that colour advertising had grown by 30 per cent last month,
but this had been offset by a fall in black and white advertising.
Advertising revenues at the Financial Times have swung between months, with
April's figures fractionally up on the previous year's, but May's 9 per cent
lower.
These fluctuations are only natural in an industry which has never been an
entirely reliable economic barometer. Advertising revenues in April last
year were particularly low because of the general election.
Mr Harold Lind, a media consultant, said: 'Advertising is a cyclical
business. The normal expectation is that television moves first, followed by
the lower end of display advertising, then feeding into the classified
advertising and recruitment last of all.'
He believes that the 3 per cent growth in television advertising expenditure
last year indicates a trend for the press this year.
Mr Sanderson said the Telegraph newspapers had taken their main growth from
three sectors: a 20 per cent growth in travel advertising, a spate of car
promotions at the start of the year, and a steady expansion of financial
products advertising.
Classified advertisments, which draw heavily on the recruitment and property
market, had remained weak.
At The Guardian, which has 43 per cent of market share for recruitment
advertisements, volume fell 9 per cent in April.
Few advertising directors are predicting much expansion in the next months -
or any real end to the heavy discounting that means most newspapers have
been receiving revenues 35 per cent lower than their official rate-card
figures in the past two years.
Ms Caroline Midmore, media manager at advertising agency Young and Rubicam
said: 'Until we get newspaper rates rising again you certainly can't really
say we're out of the recession.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Call for change to tender rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party has called on the government to change the rules on
market-testing civil service work to ensure that the quality of public
services does not fall when jobs are put out to tender.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's spokeswoman on the Citizen's Charter, said
yesterday the market-testing programme was 'poorly thought-out, inadequately
tested, monitored and assessed, and not cost-effective'. She added: 'If the
government continues at its present pace, it will have by the end of the
decade emasculated the Civil Service and substituted an infrastructure
incapable of delivering any government policies.'
The market-testing programme was cutting wages and reducing conditions of
work for civil servants, she said, and threatening standards of public
service by ignoring questions of ethics and accountability. She said
companies winning contracts for government work should be required to offer
a minimum wage, protection of pension and basic health and safety
conditions. They should abide by the same anti-discrimination rules as the
Civil Service.
Labour also wants more stringent monitoring of contracted-out work. All
successful bids should be scrutinised by the National Audit Office for cost
and quality.
Ms Mowlam called for clear means of redress for users of public services who
are dissatisfied with contractors' work. Contractors should compensate users
for defects in service.
'Whether or not services should be delivered by the public or private sector
is the wrong question,' she said. 'What is important is that services are of
high quality, are efficiently run, provided by a workforce that is not
exploited and are held accountable for taxpayers' money through elected
politicians.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Rise in late construction payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 60 per cent of construction contracts are paid late, according to
a study to be published this week.
The findings, which indicate that late payments owed to construction
suppliers last year totalled Pounds 19bn, will give fresh impetus to demands
from government and business organisations for companies to improve their
payment performance.
The Confederation of British Industry has said late payment is one of the
main causes of business failures. The Institute of Directors last week
called for improved court procedures to help small companies fighting to get
paid on time.
Construction Intelligence Data, an independent research and credit rating
organisation, has examined the experiences of about 1,000 sub-contractors.
Its findings, to be published this week, show that the record of
construction companies, renowned as some of the worst payers in UK industry,
has deteriorated even further in the past 12 months.
According to the findings the proportion of contracts involving late
payments jumped from an average of 45 per cent in the year to March 31 1992
to more than 60 per cent in the following 12 months. It is estimated that 90
per cent, or Pounds 31.5bn, of the Pounds 35bn spent annually on
construction in the UK is channelled through specialist sub-contractors.
Sub-contractors say that financially hard-pressed main contractors are
holding on to cash as long as possible instead of passing on payments from
developers and building owners to the sub-contractors actually doing the
work.
Their biggest concern is that contractors may fail before making payments.
In these circumstances sub-contractors which have already spent money doing
work can quickly follow the main contractor into receivership.
The findings show that the average number of days for which payment was
delayed, after the date agreed in the contract, had risen from 13 to 28
since the end of March last year.
They also show that main contractors were automatically deducting discounts
designed to encourage prompt payments, even when payments were late. Almost
three quarters of late payments had discounts incorrectly deducted.
It is estimated that nearly Pounds 350m had been incorrectly deducted, based
on an average discount of 2.5 per cent of the contract value. The
researchers say the number of sub-contractors starting legal action against
late or incorrect payment had risen sharply.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Labour urged to review benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR SHOULD consider using the tax system to claw back universal benefits,
such as child benefit, from the better-off, the party's largest internal
pressure group says today.
In a wide-ranging 'manifesto', the soft-left Labour Co-ordinating Committee
urges a review of aspects of the party's commitment to the welfare state.
Arguing that Labour can never 'overcome the political problems of our
commitment to welfare by implying that we can reduce its cost to the point
of invisibility', the group nevertheless contends: 'We may have to stop
doing certain things so that others can be done better.'
'A modern welfare state recognises that cash benefits are not the only way
to assist those in need,' it says.
The manifesto, scheduled for formal launch at a joint LCC/Tribune conference
in Sheffield on Saturday, identifies four areas that Labour must 'get right'
if it is to win the next general election.
It welcomes the party's return to a commitment to full employment but says
this must take into account up-to-date concepts such as flexibility of
working hours and childcare policy.
The committee reiterated its commitment to electoral reform, urging a move
towards 'collaborative government'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday denied at Leicester Crown
Court breaching health and safety law with working practices which led to a
workman's death.
The prosecution alleges that PowerGen and contractor Credfeld Camtorc of
Portsmouth failed to ensure the safety of people not directly in their
employment. Both companies pleaded not guilty.
The case follows an investigation into a fire in the oil-fuel pump room at
Ratcliffe on Soar power station, Nottinghamshire, last year.

<TEXT>
THE UK TOURIST industry this year enjoyed its best-ever first quarter, with
3.6m visitors entering the country, figures released yesterday by the
British Tourist Authority show, Michael Skapinker writes.
Tourist spending was also at record levels, up 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Visitor numbers were 8 per cent up from last year.
The increases were achieved in spite of a fall in the number of North
American visitors. Visits by North Americans fell 6 per cent to 600,000 in
the first quarter. However, the number of visitors from western Europe rose
12 per cent to 2.3m - higher than in any previous first quarter.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Lloyd's judge to expedite actions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JUSTICE SAVILLE, the High Court judge, is to step up efforts to
rationalise an increasingly complex set of legal actions involving Lloyd's
Names in the face of growing congestion in the Commercial Court.
Some observers believe that this could give a fillip to efforts by Lloyd's
to achieve an out-of-court settlement.
Mr Saville, head of the Commercial Court, will meet solicitors representing
groups of Names - the individuals whose capital backs the insurance market -
and their agents on June 21 and 22. It is understood that he is unwilling to
set new court dates for any Lloyd's cases until he has formed an overall
view of the issues.
Mr David Bird, clerk to the Commercial Court, said: 'Part of the reason for
the meetings is to find out the scale of the problems. We know a lot of
Lloyd's cases are floating about but we do not know how many or what impact
they will have.'
Parties who have not yet decided to take legal action will also be invited
to the meeting, which is being organised by Elborne Mitchell, the
solicitors.
It is also understood that Sir Michael Kerr, the former High Court judge and
privy counsellor heading Lloyd's efforts to obtain an out-of-court
settlement, will also attend the meeting. Mr Saville has asked permission
from parties involved in the disputes to meet with Sir Michael separately.
Last week Mr Saville met solicitors representing Names taking individual
action.
More than two dozen groups of Names have launched or are considering action
against their agents as part of efforts to recover insurance losses. So far
only a handful of cases has come to court, although a case by several
thousand members of the Feltrim syndicates, who are applying for a summary
judgment in their case against agents, is set to come to court in September.
To complicate matters Mr Saville is scheduled to preside in a big
non-Lloyd's case in the autumn which could last up to a year.
Earlier this year Mr Saville issued a strong warning that unless more judges
were appointed to the over-pressed Commercial Court Britain could lose its
position as a leading centre for international litigation, costing the UK
legal profession millions of pounds.
In response to his demands - and obvious pressure on other parts of the High
Court - the Lord Chancellor has undertaken to appoint a further 10 judges by
the autumn, some of whom will take charge of Commercial Court cases.

FT  03 JUN 93 / EC may ban precious-metal symbols
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 900-YEAR tradition of using crowns, anchors, lions, roses and castles to
guarantee the quality of British gold and silver is likely to be banned by
the European Commission, say UK precious-metal workers.
The symbols are among the hallmarks that must be used under British law to
protect consumers from 'under-carat' gold or adulterated silver. They are
applied by assay offices in Birmingham, Edinburgh, London and Sheffield
after independent tests.
Other EC countries say the symbols restrain trade in the single market by
forcing tougher British quality guarantees on foreign competitors. But the
Association of British Cutlers and Allied Trades says their removal would
open the UK market to cheats.
Gold items can be sold in Britain at weights of nine, 14, 18 or 22 carats.
Silver has only one standard denoted by the mark 925, which means the item
is 92.5 per cent silver, alloyed with 7.5 per cent copper. European
competitors often use 80 per cent silver.
The association says draft EC proposals to harmonise European marking
methods will allow substandard gold and silver items to be sold. Mr John
Price, association president, said yesterday: 'If we are going to harmonise,
everyone should adopt the British system.'
Mr Price, chairman of Arthur Price of England which makes traditional
silver, silver-plated and steel cutlery, said draft proposals would allow
marking by manufacturers but the onus would be on consumers to check they
had not been cheated.
EC officials had said unique British hallmarks, such as the lion for
sterling silver, the castle for Edinburgh's assay office, Sheffield's rose,
Birmingham's anchor and London's crown would be banned.
Mr Price added: 'There will be some traders in Britain who will welcome
this. The profits are enormous if you can pass off 15-carat gold as
18-carat.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / BA seeks meeting with union leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS aimed at averting a strike by British Airways cabin crews and ground
staff were adjourned yesterday, with management maintaining that some
progress had been made.
BA is now seeking a meeting with Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the
TGWU general union, in an effort to resolve the dispute over pay and
conditions.
'Talks were constructive and we made definite progress on one issue and now
seek further talks on the outstanding issue,' the airline said.
A union spokesman, however, said there was still 'a big chasm between both
sides'.
The dispute arose following the introduction of new pay and conditions for
staff at Gatwick Airport following BA's takeover of Dan-Air last year.
The main issue, which is over conditions for BA's Gatwick staff, remains to
be resolved.
Yesterday's meeting lasted five hours, and followed a ballot of TGWU members
last week which resulted in 62 per cent voting for a strike.
No immediate action was taken by the union but Mr Morris said that if no
agreement was reached a strike would be called.
The TGWU was not commenting on the talks last night. It is understood the
union does not want to say anything ahead of the proposed meeting between BA
and Mr Morris.
The result of a ballot of 3,000 BA pilots on industrial action over what
they claim is an attempt to introduce poorer pay and conditions is expected
to be announced on Friday.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Asia-Pacific nations find new
champion in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is using its influence in the OECD to press for greater international
support for developing nations, and is pushing itself forward as the
champion of other Asia-Pacific nations.
Japanese officials said they expected Tokyo to increase its development aid
budget for the next five years from the Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32.4bn) for the
five years ended April this year.
The officials said the Japanese delegation at this week's annual ministerial
meeting of the OECD planned to promote the interests of Asian developing
nations and urge the OECD, when relations between the organisation and
non-member countries are discussed today, to become more involved in the
region's economic development.
Tokyo is expected to support South Korea's application for full membership
of the OECD, which was submitted last month. According to officials, Mr
Kabun Muto, Japanese foreign minister, will also urge the OECD to:
Conduct an analysis of economic developments in China.
Support Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in their transition from communism to a
free market economy.
Develop further the supply of know-how and other assistance to the Asian
republics of the former Soviet Union.
Japan is also expected to voice support for the so-called dynamic Asian
economies of south-east Asia in talks on the OECD's links with non-member
countries. Tokyo's decision to champion the region at the talks indicates it
will stress its role as the region's premier economic power at the Group of
Seven's Tokyo summit next month.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: 'Ray of hope' on tariff-cutting
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN extensive tariff-cutting agreement among the leading industrial countries
has become 'a realistic aim' at next month's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo,
trade negotiators said in Paris yesterday, writes David Dodwell, World Trade
Editor, in Paris.
Negotiators were anxious to play down talk of a breakthrough, given the
number of times over the past four years that hopes have been dashed, but
the mood at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's
annual ministerial meeting indicated that progress has been made during the
13 ministerial meetings held since President Bill Clinton came to power in
January.
The tariff-cutting agreement, which would embrace both trade in services and
in manufactured goods, would pave the way for the long-delayed Uruguay Round
negotiations on reform of world trade to be completed by December. While
details of an agreement might not be unveiled until the Tokyo summit, a
senior US official said negotiators hoped the market access package would be
in place before then.
'In a world where economic gloom is all too prevalent, a ray of hope is
emerging from these talks,' said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade
negotiator. Ministers in Paris for the OECD meeting agreed that trade
liberalisation was one of the only ways to stimulate recovery from recession
and tackle chronically high levels of unemployment worldwide. 'We are at
last in striking distance of the largest market access package in history,'
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said at the end of a meeting of
the 'quad' trade ministers from the US, Japan, the EC and Canada.
Ministers refused to be specific about the substance of their market access
negotiations, but outlined a sequence of almost non-stop negotiation - both
bilateral meetings, and full 'quad' discussions - between now and the Tokyo
summit, which begins on July 7. A critical stepping stone will be a series
of meetings in Tokyo leading to a full 'quad' on June 23-24.
It is understood the ministers discussed harmonisation, reduction or
elimination of tariffs on manufactured goods ranging from pharmaceuticals
and medical equipment to textiles, ceramics and non-ferrous metals. They
also embraced the opening of financial services markets, telecommunications,
and audio-visual services.
Japan is believed to have offered more open access to its financial services
market when officials met their US counterparts in Washington last week.
Japanese officials are expected to give details of the new offer to EC
negotiators in Geneva today.
In contrast with the mood of harmony and progress in Paris on the Uruguay
Round, there appeared to be tensions between OECD ministers over Japanese
efforts to use the end-of-summit communique to oppose an apparent US
decision to seek managed trade and 'target setting' agreements with Tokyo as
a means of opening the market to foreign competition.
Most OECD ministers informally support Japan, but were divided yesterday on
whether the issue should be tackled head on in the communique.
There was a strong impression at the conclusion of the Franco-German summit
in Beaune yesterday of some movement in the long-stalled Gatt talks, David
Buchan writes.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said he was grateful for
German support last week in getting French farmers enough extra EC money to
make the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy acceptable to Paris and
that his government would decide later this week whether to accept the draft
oilseeds deal with the US, which EC farm ministers will decide on next
Tuesday.
However, he warned that France was not ready to swallow the rest of the farm
agreement with the US, which provides for a 21 per cent cut in the volume of
subsidised EC farm exports over six years.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Coded criticism directed at US
threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OECD called yesterday for members to give their strongest support for
completion of the long-delayed Uruguay Round of talks on international trade
liberalisation, arguing that agreement would play a crucial role in tackling
unemployment and poor global economic prospects, writes David Dodwell.
In particular, the OECD asked members to 'avoid initiatives and arrangements
which undermine the multilateral system' - a coded criticism of the US for
its use of bilateral threats to win concessions from trade partners.
In a report to OECD ministers on international trade co-operation, the
organisation warned against trade blocs which damaged open trade and
international competition. It also called for OECD countries to give better
trade access to the emergent market economies of east and central Europe,
and for harmonisation of trade policy with national strategies on the
environment, competition and investment.
The report talked of the world trading system 'under strain' with concern
over widening trade imbalances, a rising number of trade disputes and
increased use of anti-dumping actions and other 'grey area' measures to
protect domestic industries.
The OECD also presented reports on the two 'post-Uruguay Round' issues
causing anxiety - the need to harmonise international trade policies with
environmental and competition policies, which have until now been regarded
as largely domestic issues.
On competition policy, the OECD warned against a number of measures that
have aggravated trade tensions. These include:
Domestic and export cartels, which are 'often immunised from attack in the
exporting country even though they have anti-competitive effects in other
jurisdictions.'
Vertical links within or between companies which can frustrate the entry or
expansion of a foreign company.
Grey area measures, like anti-dumping actions and voluntary restraint
agreements, which 'can stimulate collusion among domestic and foreign
producers,' and restrictive trade measures like rules of origin, government
procurement rules or quotas.
On the increasingly contentious clash between trade and environmental
policies, the OECD has tried to act as a peacemaker. Its report made much of
the 'mutual supportiveness' of trade and environment policies.
The organisation called for closer international co-operation whenever a
trade policy was seen as having potential environmental implications, and an
integration of national trade and environmental policy-making at a domestic
level. Environmental 'examinations' needed to be developed as quickly as
possible.
It also argued that countries should settle cross-border environmental
disputes multilaterally rather than taking the law into their own hands  -
another coded warning that the US administration should resist pressure from
local environmental interests to act unilaterally in dealing with
international environmental disputes.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Jobless-rate alert pulls out all
stops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORDS such as 'serious', 'disturbing' and 'alarming' are strong stuff in the
subfusc world of international economic institutions such as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
But the OECD's interim report on unemployment, published last night, deploys
all three in an attempt to alert policy makers to the problems posed by
nearly 36m jobless in the industrialised world.
The organisation warns that the 'new and severe deterioration of the
employment performance' of its 24 member-states since the late 1980s is
'serious in its own right'. It brings 'individual hardship, economic loss
and threat to the social and political fabric'.
High unemployment could also trigger wrong policies such as:
Hasty and possibly ill-conceived macro-economic expansion.
Inappropriate reversal of earlier labour-market reforms introduced to help
economies modernise.
Further resort by countries to open or disguised protectionism.
But while it is easy to list the dangers that unemployment brings, the
report makes clear that solving the problem will be extremely difficult.
Present-day unemployment is 'in larger part structural,' the OECD says.
Action will be needed on several fronts - ranging from macro-economic
policy, through education and training to creating the right incentives for
entrepreneurship and ensuring that social policies, intended to help the
weakest in society, do not destroy jobs.
The OECD says the most important macro-economic measure would be for
governments to make big reductions in their structural budget deficits. This
would reduce interest rates and create conditions favourable to higher
consumption and investment.
Countries have to adapt to technological change. The OECD is convinced the
potential of the new information technologies to create jobs has not been
fully realised. Even the most flexible economies will have to brace
themselves to handle 'radically new perceptions and attitudes, and
fundamental changes in the processes of design of production, and of work
organisation'.
It follows from this that the OECD economies must remain open to
international competition while strengthening their capacity to adapt and
the ability of their workers to enhance or change their skills.
The report makes clear that 'low productivity jobs warrant the payment of
only a low wage'. The way for the future, especially in Europe where the
jobless total is expected to rise to nearly 23m next year, lies in
higher-productivity jobs filled with workers with higher skills rather than
in minimum wages or a narrowing of wage differentials.
Low-paid jobs may be useful. They can introduce the young to work and serve
as a 'port of entry' for immigrants to the labour market. 'But the overall
strategy must be that people not become trapped in them and that low-paid
jobs should not become widespread.'
The OECD therefore calls for a balanced policy of greater wage flexibility
'buttressed with a comprehensive policy, which would include education, the
school-to-work transition, training and retraining'.
Countries need a sound and modernised initial education system, better links
between academic and vocational studies and an adult training system adapted
to the needs of both employers and workers.
But education and training will not be sufficient. Active labour-policies
are needed to cut the time people spend on the dole and to make vacancy and
job matches more efficient. Enterprise needs to be encouraged.
'Access to start-up capital and, even more so, to long-term capital during
the early expansion period is very important.'
The Paris-based OECD was one of the first international organisations to
sound the alarm about rising unemployment. It has taken a year to produce a
30-page interim report on the subject. The fact that another year's work is
planned shows how intractable a problem unemployment has become in the
industrialised world.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: West's farmers reap Dollars 354bn
in subsidies - Governments resist reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAXPAYERS and consumers in the industrialised world subsidised farmers to
the tune of Dollars 354bn (Pounds 229.8bn) in 1992 - or about Dollars 440
per head - according to the OECD. Subsidies were up 7 per cent from 1991 as
governments continued to resist reforms in the sector.
World farm trade grew by about 6.6 per cent last year, but falling prices
meant that earnings barely rose.
In its annual study of the farm sector the OECD forecast a sharp fall in
cereal exports this year, as China and the former Soviet Union cut imports,
and predicted falling prices for most key farm products over the next four
years.
Since 1971, agriculture's share of world trade has dwindled from 15 per cent
to 9.4 per cent, the OECD said.
Total transfers to the OECD farm sector, largely made up of contributions
from taxpayers and consumers, fell in Canada, Finland, New Zealand and
Sweden. But these were more than offset by a 10 per cent increase in the US,
from Dollars 81.1bn to Dollars 91.1bn, and a similar increase in Japan, from
Dollars 65.6bn to Dollars 74bn.
In value terms the biggest subsidiser remained the European Community, which
transferred Dollars 155.9bn (up from Dollars 146.4bn). But the heaviest
individual burdens fell in Finland, where transfers amounted to Dollars 910
per head. By comparison, people living in the EC paid Dollars 450 apiece,
while those in Japan paid Dollars 600 and those in the US Dollars 360.
The biggest beneficiaries of these farm subsidies were Scandinavian farmers.
Transfers averaged Dollars 39,600 per farmer in Norway and Dollars 38,600 in
Sweden. US farmers benefited from transfers averaging Dollars 36,100.
Transfers for each Japanese farmer averaged Dollars 31,300, while EC farmers
gained by Dollars 17,700 per head.
In a largely gloomy examination of prospects for the farm sector up until
1997, the OECD saw three possible grounds for optimism:
Hopes that reform of the EC's common agriculture policy, which began to take
effect in January this year, would trim levels of EC farm support;
Hopes that a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks would begin to erode farm subsidies;
Strong economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which might stimulate
world demand for certain farm products, particularly meat.
The OECD report was, however, concerned that a slower than forecast recovery
from recession would depress demand for farm products and prices.
'Most countries have not so far embarked on reform leading to significantly
reduced levels of agricultural support,' the report said. Complaining of the
'competitive subsidisation' of farm exports by the US and the EC, it said
these subsidies 'have changed the structure of the world market, have
resulted in significantly lower world prices, and reduced production
incentives for farmers in non-subsidising countries'.

FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Price supports in EC hamper
eastern reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER Soviet states' plans to liberalise their farm sectors are being
thwarted by the European Community's distorting policies of price supports,
intervention purchasing and export subsidies, the OECD said yesterday.
In its first study of the farm sector in the former planned economies of
central and eastern Europe and China the OECD is disturbed by 'back
tracking' from liberalisation, particularly in east Europe and the former
Soviet bloc. This is due to a desire to harmonise farm policies with those
of the EC, with which most of the countries seek eventual membership, and
short-term aid to farmers to help them through disruptions as economies are
restructured.
'The difficulty of removing these short-term policies once this process is
complete has mostly been overlooked,' the study says.
It describes a big growth in subsistence farming on inefficient small farms
as unemployment soars. At the same time, severe drought across parts of
central and eastern Europe in 1992 damaged farm output - grain production
fell by 30 per cent from 1991 to 58m tonnes.
In the former Soviet Union, the OECD reports a 10 per cent fall in
agriculture production last year, largely due to a collapse in livestock
production. Grain output nevertheless rose by 20 per cent to 194m tonnes
following a collapse in 1991, making the farm sector less traumatised than
the economy at large, which contracted by 18 per cent.
The organisation predicts that the former Soviet Union will continue to
import grains, sugar and oilseeds this year although imports 'will
increasingly depend on the availability of western credits and assistance
packages'.
The OECD saw the fall in livestock production as an opportunity to
rationalise an inefficient sector, where feed grain use is at virtually the
same level as in the US but producing a quarter of the meat.
China's farmers face different challenges, with natural disasters and a
preference for investing in rural housing rather than farming weakening the
production system. Farming generated 4m new jobs during 1991 and 1992, the
OECD says.
This was insufficient to cope with 11m people pouring on to the rural job
market, and left the country with a 'floating population' between urban and
rural areas of about 70m.
The OECD predicts that China will remain a significant wheat importer, but
notes that grain imports have fallen from 11m tonnes in 1989 to 'probably
less than 3m tonnes in 1992'.

<TEXT>
MR Jorge Serrano, Guatemala's former president, left the country for El
Salvador yesterday, a day after he was deposed by the Guatemalan military.
A Salvadorean government official confirmed that Mr Serrano was in the
country and being treated normally. He had left Guatemala after his safety
was guaranteed publicly by the army there.
Last week Mr Serrano had suspended the constitution and attempted to seize
authoritarian powers.
Congress has been given five days by a constitutional court to name a new
president and vice-president.
Last night, however, Vice-President Gustavo Espina declared himself
president. Speaking at his home surrounded by civilian members of Mr
Serrano's former cabinet, he denied that he had resigned along with the
president on Tuesday.
The Congress went into emergency session on hearing the news.
In negotiations with the military and business leaders, leading politicians
have given a commitment to 'cleanse' Congress of corrupt legislators. Mr
Serrano's claim last week that many legislators were crooked touched a chord
in the country, but it is not clear how the purge will be achieved.
Apart from the vice-president, possible successors to Mr Serrano - to
complete a term up to January 1996 - are Mr Arturo Herbruger, 83-year-old
president of the supreme electoral tribunal, and Mr Edmond Mulet, ambassador
to Washington, who resigned following Mr Serrano's attempted 'self-coup'.
Mr Serrano was deposed after meetings on Monday night and Tuesday morning
with business and political leaders. He tried to persuade congressmen to
reconvene the legislature but, after he seemed to have failed to win enough
support, he was asked by military commanders - led by General Jose Domingo
Garca Samayoa, the defence minister - to stand down.
Mr Serrano's removal is being seen as a counter-coup by the military,
business and political classes without any important popular participation.
'The popular movement has demonstrated its considerable weakness,' said Mr
Rene Toitevin, a political analyst.

FT  03 JUN 93 / The noisy second coming of Ross Perot: Renewed interest in
his populism reflects discontent with the US political elite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICA certainly knows that Ross Perot can dish it out. The suspicion is
now growing that America is about to find out, for the second time in a
year, whether the Texan businessman can also take it.
If he cannot, then the weary look that comes into President Bill Clinton's
eyes when he is asked about Mr Perot, independent candidate for president
last year, may change. Now Mr Clinton mostly ducks questions, referring to
aides, who also generally duck questions.
But the White House is far from alone in determining that public silence is
the best policy. Political Washington is running scared of the populist
phenomenon who took 19 per cent of the vote in the election last year and
is, according to most present polls, as popular a public figure as any in
the country.
The latest Perotian barrage has been aimed squarely at the president. Some
of it has been cruelly funny - his Dollars 10 razor-shave crop contrasted
with the presidential perm costing perhaps 20 times as much. But hardly a
television morning or evening seems to pass without either a Perot interview
or paid 'infomercial' damning the president either as personally unqualified
('you wouldn't figure him higher than middle management') or for advancing
bad policies.
Over the last two weeks he has suggested that Mr Clinton was contemplating a
war in Bosnia to distract from his domestic difficulties, flirting with a
national healthcare catastrophe ('every time you look the cost has gone
up'), selling US interests out in the Nafta agreement ('the sucking sound of
jobs heading south'), and deceiving the public with a wrong-headed approach
to cutting the budget deficit by raising taxes.
So virulent has been the onslaught on the Democratic president that
speculation is now rampant that Mr Perot either is planning another
independent candidacy or has it in mind to hijack the Republican party, more
feasible now that the other president he loved to denigrate, George Bush, is
in retirement in Texas.
Discreet conversations with Senator Bob Dole add to this latter impression,
even if it may not be on the Minority leader's agenda. Mr Perot himself
brushes aside all such questions, repeating the eternal litany that he is
only the servant of 'the people'.
There is scattered evidence, too, that Mr Perot's grandiosely labelled
quasi-political organisation, United We Stand, America, is becoming a
grassroots force. Details of its membership (Dollars 15 a head) will not be
published until the end of this year but already local chapters stage
assorted conferences and talk-ins, which even such heavyweight politicians
as the Majority leader, Senator George Mitchell of Maine, find impolitic to
ignore (because Maine was Mr Perot's best state last November).
Perot-styled candidates, operating so far without his endorsement and,
generally, that of UWSA, have not done well in a handful of special
elections, especially in his native Texas, though one Republican clone
nearly captured a Wisconsin House seat. The Los Angeles mayoral election
next month, however, features Richard Riordan, a conservative self-made
businessman who talks Perotian.
However, while the man stalks the airwaves at will, there are signs that the
media, having bloodied Mr Clinton, are gearing up for the sort of scrutiny
which got under Mr Perot's notoriously thin skin last year. His withdrawal
from the presidential race in July followed negative reporting on his
'Inspector Perot' tendency to investigate the private lives of others; his
late re-entry with only a month to go mostly avoided a second wave of
hostile coverage.
A growing compendium of media reports note disarray in UWSA chapters across
the country, with leading local 'volunteers' at odds with the Dallas-based
head office, described by several to the New York Times this week as
'dictatorial, secretive and duplicitous'.
Newsweek magazine also questioned the secretiveness of 'a carefully crafted
legal entity - a not-for-profit 'civil league' - that allows Mr Perot to
raise funds and act the role of undeclared candidate without having to
disclose his list of contributors'.
ABC TV's Nightline, which collaborated with Newsweek on the Perot
investigation, last week subjected several of the volunteers to a barrage of
questions. The thrust of the replies was that many felt he was authoritarian
by nature.
Even former Perot intimates are now publicly sour. Mr Orson Swindle, nominal
campaign chief in the run-up to the election, now insists Mr Perot and his
tight circle in Dallas 'encouraged everybody to be heard and didn't have the
capacity to listen'. Mr Ed Rollins, campaign guru in the first springtime
run at the presidency, will say publicly and privately that he now thinks Mr
Perot is 'the most dangerous man in America'.
Even those who still give him credit for wakening the public to the
magnitude of the budget deficit now think he is all blue smoke, mirrors and
meaningless charts. A Washington Post editorial at the weekend, bemoaning a
lack of substance, complained about his 'sweeping generalisation and
slash-and-burn rhetoric'.
Critical attention is also being drawn to the pattern of Mr Perot's courting
of individual media outlets. If irritated by a tough interviewer (Mr Bryant
Gumbel of NBC's Today) or a critical programme (last week's Nightline) he
switches his attention to different networks and programmes. With his money
and their need for revenues, appearances, paid-for and free, are easily
scheduled.
In one sense the second coming of Ross Perot, as with any pure populist, is
a reflection of public discontent with the management of the nation by its
establishment elite, now uncertainly led by Mr Clinton but also featuring an
invitingly fractious Congress and a national media inclined to go
head-hunting.
But to endure he will have to know what it is like not only to chase but
also to be hunted. Even Achilles, a phenomenon from a different age, had a
fatal weakness.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Budget delays healthcare reform plan
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is delaying release of his healthcare reform plan in
order to concentrate on winning Senate approval for his deficit-cutting
economic plan, the White House indicated yesterday.
Mr Clinton said he did not expect a 'sustained delay', but refused to set a
date for publication of the healthcare plan.
'I'm focused right now on passing the budget in the Senate,' he said, adding
that the administration intended to remove as many kinks from the plan as
possible before sending it to Congress.
The Senate is unlikely to vote on the economic plan until the beginning of
July so the health plan is likely to be delayed until at least mid-July.
However, this would be only a fortnight before the August recess and the
plan may be postponed until September.
Mr Clinton originally promised to send the healthcare reform proposal to
Congress within 100 days of his inauguration. It was then delayed, first to
mid-May and then to the middle of this month.
The latest delay reflects the tough fight the administration faces in the
Senate if it is to pass the economic plan without too many concessions. Mr
Clinton said this week he would accept a shift in emphasis from tax
increases to spending cuts.
But a delay is also opportune because Mr Clinton has yet to make crucial
decisions on the shape of the healthcare reform. The administration is still
debating the nature of the benefits to be guaranteed, the details of reforms
to the insurance system and the plan's finance.
Some advisers want a payroll tax on employers and employees to displace
corporate health premiums.

THE leaders of Venezuela's two dominant political parties have chosen
Senator Ramon J. Velasquez, a respected writer and historian, as their
candidate to become the country's provisional president.
This decision by the ruling Democratic Action party (AD) and the opposition
Christian democratic Copei may solve the national leadership crisis, which
arose when President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended from office on May 21
to face corruption charges.
Mr Octavio Lepage, chairman of the Senate, was sworn in as acting-president
immediately after the suspension but the opposition parties have been
calling for his removal.
Both chambers of Congress must meet to consider the candidacy and vote in
secret on the new provisional president. This is expected by the end of the
week. The canddate should secure a majority because the two main political
parties dominate Congress.
A full presidential election is due in December.
Mr Velasquez has asked the two main parties for special powers to enact by
decree a series of reforms that have been languishing in Congress for
months. These are expected to include new taxes to help cover the
govenrment's fiscal deficit, tax cuts, levies on the national oil company, a
reform of the privatisation law, and a bill authorising central government
borrowing this year.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he wanted to confer with leading
senators on his contested nomination of Ms Lani Guinier to run the Justice
Department's civil rights division, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
He said Ms Guinier's record as a civil rights lawyer was 'first rate' and
insisted that many of the attacks on what are seen as her radical views
'cannot be supported by a fair reading of her writings'. But he added that
he had to take into account reservations expressed by key senators,
especially those Democrats who have doubted that she can win confirmation.
Ms Guinier, who is black and a Pennsylvania University law professor, is a
Clinton friend of 20 years standing. She has come under fire, initially from
the right wing, for having contended in academic articles that existing US
voting rights laws still offered insufficient protection for minorities.
The Guinier case is now reckoned a new litmus test of Mr Clinton's political
stance.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Rebound in new home sales surprises analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF new homes rose 22.7 per cent between March and April to an annual
rate of 751,000, the highest level since the economic boom of the mid-1980s,
the US Commerce Department reported yesterday, reports Michael Prowse in
Washington.
In a separate report, however, the department said the official index of
leading indicators stagnated in April after a sharp decline in March. The
leading index is designed to give early warning of changes in economic
activity.
The two reports were typical of recent economic statistics, which have been
unusually volatile, frequently sending conflicting signals about the
economy, which appears to be growing sluggishly after a depressed first
quarter.
Most forecasters had expected a small rebound in home sales after bad winter
weather depressed the housing market in the first quarter. But the scale of
the increase left analysts scrambling for explanations.
The rebound was partly driven by improving fundamentals - the lowest
mortgage rates in two decades and a relatively low ratio of home prices to
incomes. But the outsized April increase also reflected downward revisions
to figures for February and March and an erratic doubling of sales in the
north-east, the region most affected by severe storms.
Over the first four months as a whole, the annual rate of sales averaged
642,000, only fractionally above the average level in the second half of
last year. April will thus have marked a turning point only if sales figures
in May and June remain well above first quarter levels.
The index of leading indicators rose 0.1 per cent between March and April,
pointing to only a gradual improvement in the economy. Six of 11 components,
led by an increase in the length of the working week, contributed positively
to the increase in the leading index.
Five components, led by a decline in industrial orders, made negative
contributions.
The official index of coincident indicators - a guide to current economic
conditions - dropped 0.4 per cent in April after increases of 0.2 per cent
in both February and March, confirming other signs of faltering recovery in
recent months.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS between Russia and the Far East are to be modernised and
capacity increased through an optical fibre cable linking Nakhodka in Russia
with Japan and South Korea, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
A plan to install the cable has been agreed by Intertelecom, the Russian
telecom operator, Denmark's GN Great Northern Telegraph Company and the
Danish state's Telecom Denmark.
The Danish companies will finance the Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.7m) investment
in the Russian part of the cable, while Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan and
Korea Telecom will finance the rest of the link, running in all to 1,700km.
Total cost of the project, due for completion in early 1995, is about
Dollars 160m.
Great Northern and Intertelecom last April inaugurated an optical fibre
cable between Denmark and St Petersburg, with a microwave link to Moscow.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Stability vital, Gatt tells South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA has considerable potential as a market, a supplier and a host
for new investments, but political stability will be essential, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today.
The report notes that the severe recession since 1989 has led to an annual
drop in per capita incomes of 3 per cent a year and a loss of one million
jobs. Unemployment has risen to record levels and over 40 per cent of the
labour force is estimated to be outside the formal economic sector.
'The immediate challenge is to regenerate growth in the context of policies
aimed at social advancement,' Gatt says. 'To this end, a reorientation of
production away from emphasis on satisfying limited domestic demand and more
along the lines of South Africa's comparative advantage should lay the
foundation for sustainable growth.'
The report says that between 1985 and 1989 sanctions, especially financial
sanctions and the disinvestment campaign, may have cost 13 per cent of 1991
gross domestic product. Trade sanctions were less effective, lopping perhaps
7 per cent off export earnings.
Though the process of dismantling sanctions began in 1990, Gatt argues that
many of South Africa's economic problems are home-grown, resulting partly
from the apartheid system which created damaging rigidities in resource
allocation, and partly from inward-looking policies that stressed import
substitution at the expense of exports. Rising labour costs, persistent
inflation and business concentration have hurt competitiveness.
Gatt says that with the lifting of sanctions South Africa is now looking to
fashion more outward looking trade policies, and has made some progress in
removing import controls, reducing tariffs and lowering import surcharges.
Deregulation, privatisation and macroeconomic stabilisation 'are being
cautiously pursued'. However, the tariff regime is 'far from stable or
transparent' and industry remains heavily protected by high trade barriers
and reliant on expensive export subsidies.
Gatt's governing council, which discussed the report yesterday, urged South
Africa to implement economic reforms more rapidly, undertake autonomous
trade liberalisation and improve its modest tariff offer in the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: S Korean credit for China chemical deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAMSUNG, the South Korean conglomerate, is providing a Dollars 48m (Pounds
31m) credit to help upgrade an ethylene project in China's north-east, under
an ambitious plan to make the plant one of the largest producers in Asia.
Samsung's involvement will help increase ethylene production to 300,000
tonnes a year.
An agreement was signed at the weekend with the Jilin Chemical company and
China National Chemical Construction. Last September, the South Korean
company won a Dollars 200m contract to modernise the Jilin plant, China's
largest producer of chemical fibres.
Mr B H Kim, Samsung's chief representative in Beijing, said Jilin Chemical
would use the export credit loan to buy ethylene glycol production equipment
made under licence in Korea. He said there were also plans to build
petrochemical plants at Shandong, Hubei and Guangdong.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Moscow closes in on western satellite deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA has won half the battle to enter the west's lucrative commercial
satellite launch market but must now get the west Europeans to endorse its
deal with the Americans allowing it two space launches a year up to the year
2000.
Having decided to make market access for Russia a key priority after the
US-Russian summit in Vancouver, the US has agreed in principle for Russia to
conduct 12 launches until the end of the century to try to help its
impoverished space industry. In order not to undercut western companies,
Russia would commit itself to charging prices which were no more than 7.5
per cent cheaper than comparable western launches.
The market for launching telecommunications satellites into space is
dominated by western Europe's Arianespace, which fears its business could be
wiped out by cheap Russian launches on high-quality Proton rockets. It is
therefore trying to impose quotas and price floors.
The US is involved because it can withhold export licences for mainly
US-built satellites which are to be shipped to Russia for launching.
The simmering trade war between the US and the EC has made it impossible to
hammer out a tripartite agreement. Instead Russia is having to negotiate
separately with the Americans and the Europeans.
Mr Valentin Kozyrev, a Russian space agency official, said: 'We are not
satisfied by the quotas offered by the Europeans. We want to get closer to
the agreement reached with the Americans.' He declined however to spell out
the differences.
Russia and the US want a bilateral agreement to be ready for signing when Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, meets Vice-President Al
Gore at the end of June.
It is not clear however when a similar agreement might be reached with the
Europeans, although one west European diplomat said this would be soon since
everybody was in a hurry to show goodwill to Russia as it struggles with
economic reforms.
The issue is likely to be raised during talks starting in Moscow today
between the Russian government and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner
responsible for negotiating a partnership agreement with Russia, as well as
for handling the EC's international trade negotiations.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, is expected to arrive in Moscow
today to urge the Russian government to speed up progress on economic
reforms and prepare for the G7 summit in Tokyo.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leaders of Venezuela's two dominant political parties have chosen
Senator Ramon J. Velasquez, a respected writer, historian and politician, as
their candidate to become the provisional president.
This decision by the ruling Democratic Action party (AD) and the opposition
Christian democratic Copei may solve the national leadership crisis, which
arose when President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended from office on May 21
to face corruption charges.
Mr Octavio Lepage, chairman of the Senate, was sworn in as acting-president
immediately after the suspension but the opposition parties have been
calling for his removal ever since.
Both chambers of Congress must meet to consider the candidacy and vote in
secret on the new provisional president. This is expected by the end of the
week. A majority vote is required, which should be secured for the candidate
because the two main political parties dominate Congress.
AD and Copei leaders are using all their political influence to secure Mr
Velasquez's election, despite complaints from small opposition parties. A
full presidential election is due in December.
While agreeing to stand for the interim presidency, Mr Velasquez has asked
the two main parties to give him special powers so he can enact by decree a
series of reforms that have been languishing in Congress for months.
These measures are expected to include new taxes to help cover the
govenrment's fiscal deficit, tax cuts, levies on the national oil company, a
reform of the privatisation law, and a bill authorising central government
borrowing this year.
Mr Velasquez, a moderate voice and conciliator in Venezuelan politics, is a
senator for his home state of Tachira.
Although he was elected to the Senate on the AD slate, he is seen as a
political independent and has held high positions in both AD and Copei
administrations.
Last year, Mr Perez named him to chair a special commission that recommended
widespread government reforms.

TAIWAN is considering a package of financial incentives and other measures
to expand its export processing zones, the government's Export Processing
Zone Administration said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The Commercial Times newspaper quoted officials as saying the package would
include the lifting of remaining restrictions on imports into the zones.
This would reduce import costs by 20-30 per cent, helping exporters to
increase competitiveness in the world market, the newspaper said.
The administration would also upgrade infrastructure in the zones and
maintain factory leasing rates at low levels.
The 242 factories operating in Taiwan's three export processing zones
registered combined exports of Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 3.05bn) in 1992. In
recent months, government officials have expressed concern that weakness in
the global economy is hurting Taiwan's export sector.

FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Software piracy cost declining in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOFTWARE piracy in Europe, now costing the computer industry more than
Dollars 4.6bn annually in lost sales, is on the decline.
Statistics published yesterday by the Business Software Alliance, which
represents the major personal computer software houses, showed the
percentage of illegal software used in Europe fell from 76 per cent to 66
per cent between 1990 and 1991.
The reasons for the decline included tougher copyright laws throughout the
EC, local campaigns which have increased awareness of the penalties for
piracy, and a flood of legal actions against infringers.
Mr Brad Smith, European legal counsel for the BSA said: 'Last year, the BSA
filed more than 100 legal actions in 10 countries in Europe'.
Financial losses in 1992 were highest in France at Dollars 1.3bn, while the
greatest level of piracy was found in Italy and Spain at 85 per cent of the
market.
The UK showed most improvement, Mr Smith said, where legal software now
constitutes 46 per cent of the market.

<TEXT>
MR George Price, prime minister of Belize, has called a general election for
June 30, 15 months before it was constitutionally due.
The announcement came a few hours after the resignation of Mr Jorge Serrano
as president of neighbouring Guatemala. He and Mr Price had reached an
accord to end Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim on the former
British colony in Central America.
The Belizean opposition is claiming that the government has no plans to
defend the country against any invasion by Guatemala.
Britain announced last month that it is to withdraw its 1,400-strong
garrison in Belize. British troops had been stationed there to deter
Guatemala from military action to pursue its claim.
Mr Price's People's United party has a comfortable parliamentary majority,
and the election is expected to keep it in power at the expense of the main
opposition United Democratic party.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Budget delays healthcare reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is delaying release of his healthcare reform plan in
order to concentrate on winning Senate approval for his deficit-cutting
economic plan, the White House indicated yesterday.
President Bill Clinton said he did not expect a 'sustained delay', but
refused to set a date for publication of the healthcare plan.
'I'm focused right now on passing the budget in the Senate,' Mr Clinton
said, adding that the administration intended to remove as many kinks from
the plan as possible before sending it to Congress.
Since the Senate is unlikely to vote on the economic plan until the
beginning of July at the earliest, the health plan is likely to be delayed
until at least the middle of July. However, this would be only a fortnight
before the month-long August recess, and the plan may be postponed until
September.
Mr Clinton originally promised to send the healthcare reform proposal to
Capitol Hill within 100 days of his inauguration. It was then delayed first
to mid-May and then to the middle of this month. The latest delay reflects
the tough fight the administration faces in the Senate if it is to pass the
economic plan without too many concessions. Mr Clinton said this week he
would accept a shift in emphasis from tax increases to spending cuts.
But a delay is also opportune because Mr Clinton has yet to make crucial
decisions on the shape of the healthcare reform. The administration is still
debating the nature of the healthcare benefits that would be guaranteed, the
details of reforms to the healthcare insurance system and the way the plan
would be financed.
Some advisers are keen on replacing corporate health premiums by a payroll
tax on employers and employees. This would ensure that large companies
shouldered most of the burden of higher health spending, but would be
strongly opposed by conservative Democrats and Republicans.
The administration is also considering a new tax on hospitals to recoup some
of the windfall gains they would receive if the health insurance system were
extended to cover the 37m people currently without insurance.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Pierre Buyoya, unexpectedly defeated in Burundi's first democratic
election, congratulated his victorious opponent, Mr Melchior Ndadaye,
yesterday and urged the country to accept the result, Reuter reports from
Bujumbura.
'You have just chosen your president, who will lead Burundi for the next
five years,' Mr Buyoya said in a statement read on state radio. 'As I said
before embarking on the race, I undertook to bow before the verdict of the
people. That is the rule of democracy.'
Official provisional results gave Mr Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker, 60 per
cent of the vote, confounding forecasts that Mr Buyoya would win by a
similar margin to extend the presidency he seized in a bloodless coup in
1987.
Mr Ndadaye is from the majority Hutu tribe, which has been governed for
decades by the Tutsi minority, of which Mr Buyoya is a member.
It was the first democratic election in the central African state since
independence from Belgium in 1962.
The history of the state since independence has been marred by the slaughter
of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly Hutu killed for challenging their
Tutsi masters.

THE US yesterday failed to make headway in talks with North Korea on nuclear
weapons, but a new round of talks is to be held tomorrow.
The Americans pressed North Korea to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty, holding out the prospect of better relations if the Pyongyang
communist regime reversed its March decision to renounce the pact.
'We had seven hours of discussions but I cannot report any significant
progress,' said Mr Robert Gallucci, a US assistant secretary of state. The
chief North Korean delegate, Mr Kang Sok Chu, said only that the talks went
on 'in an atmosphere of frankness and sincerity'.
Although the meeting in New York was not under UN auspices, the US was
acting in line with a Security Council resolution calling on North Korea to
reconsider its decision to withdraw from the treaty and to co-operate with
the International Atomic Energy Agency on verification.
The US has indicated it might respond to a positive reply by suspending
military exercises with South Korea, long an irritant for Pyongyang. North
Korea wants a big cut in America's military presence in the South and is
keen to develop trade with the US.
South Korea yesterday said it had agreed to key North Korean conditions for
a meeting but insisted on keeping to its own timetable, Reuter adds from
Seoul.
In a letter to the Pyongyang leadership, South Korea said it accepted the
North's agenda for talks aimed at defusing a row over nuclear proliferation,
but it said the meeting could not be held before Saturday, rather than North
Korea's preferred date of tomorrow.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S Appeal Court yesterday set aside a six-year jail term for Mrs
Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, although it upheld her conviction for kidnapping.
The court amended the penalty to a R15,000 (Pounds 3,025) fine or one year
in prison, and a two-year term conditionally suspended for five years. It
dismissed her original conviction on a charge of accessory to assault on
four black youths at her home in Soweto.
The decision is likely to defuse potential trouble among young black
supporters during South Africa's transition to democracy. But criminal
experts said it appeared an unusually light sentence for kidnapping.
Mrs Mandela was originally convicted and sentenced in May 1991 to five
years' imprisonment on four counts of kidnapping and one year as an
accessory to assault.
The Appeal Court also ordered her to pay compensation of R5,000 each to the
three surviving victims of the 1989 kidnappings and assaults. The body of a
fourth victim, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, was found in a field in January
1989.
Mr Justice Corbett, the chief justice, said that he believed a substantial
fine, suspended sentence and payment of compensation to the victims was a
fit punishment which would also achieve a measure of 'social justice'.
Mrs Mandela's estranged husband said yesterday, after meeting President F W
de Klerk, that the ANC and government were very close to agreement on a date
for the first all-race elections. It was their second meeting this week. Mr
Mandela told reporters the two sides had made substantial progress on
constitutional issues. Mr de Klerk concurred, saying: 'We are doing our
level best to ensure progress in the negotiation process. We have worked
around the clock. . . and we will continue to work until we reach the moment
where further progress can be registered.'

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE corporate investment will fall for the second year running in the
year to next April, the most severe contraction since the early 1970s,
according to a wide-ranging survey published yesterday by the Ministry for
International Trade and Industry (Miti).
The survey of 1,591 large companies found they planned to cut investment by
2.8 per cent this financial year, after a 9 per cent drop last year.
It will be the first time since 1971 and 1972 that corporate investment has
fallen for two years running. The cutbacks are in response to the squeeze on
corporate profits following heavy investment during the late 1980s by both
manufacturers and service companies.
Continued corporate retrenchment, combined with stagnant personal
consumption, means public sector spending on social infrastructure will
continue to be the main domestic source of growth in the Japanese economy
until corporate profits and consumer spending recover.
The survey found that steep falls in manufacturing investment more than
offset increases planned by service companies. Manufacturing investment in
facilities and equipment is expected to fall by 14.6 per cent next year
after an 18.2 per cent drop last year. Investment in the car industry will
fall by 17.5 per cent, in steel by 22.1 per cent and chemicals by 20.8 per
cent.
The private sector advisory panel which oversaw the survey said it was
concerned that the cuts increasingly included spending on research and
development which were vital for companies' long-term competitiveness.

<TEXT>
FEARS of renewed inter-religious unrest resurfaced in Bombay, India's
commercial capital, yesterday after violence broke out at the funeral of a
murdered leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the militant Hindu party.
Over 3,000 soldiers and police were deployed on the streets to prevent any
repetition of the riots which hit Bombay in the winter after Hindu militants
stormed a mosque in the holy town of Ayodhya and set off nation-wide
inter-religious violence. Yesterday's incident was the most serious threat
to public order since the terrorist bombs which rocked Bombay in early
March.
Fighting broke out when police tried to stop mourners stoning a mosque on
the funeral route. The police fired tear-gas shells at the crowd.
The mourners were marking the death of Mr Premkumar Sharma, a member of the
Maharashtra state assembly, who was shot dead outside his home on Tuesday.
Mr Premkumar was killed just days after the assassination of another
militant Hindu politician - Mr Ramesh More, a member of Shiv Sena, the
radical Bombay Hindu grouping.
There was widespread concern that militant Hindus might seek to avenge the
two deaths by attacking Moslems.
The city has been calm since March because BJP and Shiv Sena leaders have
urged their supporters to avoid violence, even though Moslems are widely
blamed for the bombings.
The police suspect the blasts were organised by Moslem-led criminal gangs,
possibly with help from Pakistan or another Islamic country. The two
brothers whom police regard as the principal organisers of the attack -
Yakub and Ishaq Memon - fled to Dubai and were later thought to have gone to
Pakistan.
The 70 or so people arrested in Bombay are all Moslems.
However, the militant Hindu leaders' patience may be cracking under pressure
from radical supporters. Mr Bal Thackeray, chief of Shiv Sena, has warned
that he would not tolerate attacks on his friends such as Mr More.
The police investigation into the blasts has also disclosed tensions amongst
different criminal gangs and among politicians, some of whom have been
connected to the protection of gangs.
Mr A S Samra, the Bombay police chief, last night assigned police guards to
all Bombay politicians. He said that there might be a criminal conspiracy
behind the killings of the two politicians, but no firm link had been
established.
Mr More was involved in trade unions linked to Shiv Sena which have been
spreading through Bombay, in some cases attempting to force companies to
stop hiring Moslems.
Mr Sharma, a well-liked politician, helped the police in their
investigations of the blasts by providing information about the business
activities of criminal gangs in his constituency. The police suspect this
may have been a reason why he was singled out for attack.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Beijing repeats offer of talks with Dalai Lama

UNDER international pressure over human rights in Tibet, China yesterday
repeated its offer to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader.
But the official Xinhua newsagency made it clear there would be no shift in
the Chinese position that Tibet is an 'inalienable part of China', and that
discussion of independence would not be countenanced.
The governor of Tibet, Gyalcon Norbu was quoted as saying that 'any form of
talks can be held with him (Dalai Lama) so long as he abandons his stand on
independence, semi-independence or independence in a disguised form.'
China's offer to receive the Dalai Lama follows last week's nationalist
demonstrations in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, which involved up to 4,000
people who were dispersed by security personnel firing tear gas canisters.
The disturbances took place a day after a European Community fact-finding
mission to Tibet ended in recrimination after two Tibetans were arrested,
allegedly to prevent them making contact.
The EC this week protested over the arrests, saying it was 'deeply
concerned' at police action against demonstrators last week, and urged the
Chinese to release the individuals concerned.
The EC statement also expressed disquiet over the 'general human rights
situation of the Tibetan people.'
'The Community and its member states believe that the problems of Tibet can
best be resolved through dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the
representatives of the Tibetan people, including its spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, and urge both sides to engage in this without preconditions,'
the statement said.
The London-based Tibet Information Network, meanwhile, reported that between
7 and 13 Tibetans were arrested in Lhasa on Tuesday for pro-independence
agitation.
Xinhua news agency quoted the Tibetan governor, Mr Norbu, as firmly
rejecting criticism of Beijing's policy towards Tibet, saying it was an
internal matter for China.
'Tibet is an indispensable part of China and Tibetans constitute one part of
the Chinese nation,' he declared.
'No government, organisation or individual is permitted to intervene in the
affair.'

Burundi's military leader, Jean Pierre Buyoya, was unexpectedly beaten in
the country's first democratic election by challenger Melchior Ndadaye,
according to undeclared provisional results, Reuter reports from Bujumbura.
The results, to be announced later today, showed that Mr Ndadaye confounded
forecasts and polled more than 60 per cent of the vote.
Mr Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker, is a member of the majority Hutu tribe
which has been governed for decades by the Tutsi minority, of which Mr
Buyoya is a member.
It was the first democratic election in the central African state since
independence from Belgium in 1962.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Amnesty says women tortured in Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of women have been detained, harassed and intimidated in Tunisia
over the past two years, according to a report published today by the
London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International, writes
Francis Ghiles.
The report also says that 'scores (of women) were tortured, ill-treated,
beaten and sexually abused and threatened with rape in the ministry of the
interior and police stations where torture and ill-treatment of men
detainees had become routine.'
Initially, women were targeted by the Tunisian security forces because they
were relatives of the now-banned Al Nahda (Renaissance) movement. However,
the report adds that 'since the middle of 1992, women activists and the
wives of activists of the Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens have been
subjected to the same pattern of human rights violations.'
Amnesty fears that as long as the Tunisian government 'refuses to recognise
the widespread nature of these violations, including the fact that torture
and ill-treatment are systematic, then these violations will continue and
the circle of repression will widen further.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: Sihanouk offers mediation after poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian monarch, has offered to
mediate between the two parties which won the most votes in last week's
UN-organised election, in an attempt to avert a violent confrontation.
With more than four fifths of the ballots counted, the royalist opposition
party Funcinpec appears to have beaten the government's communist Cambodian
People's Party.
So far Funcinpec has 45.7 per cent of the valid votes, against 38.1 per cent
for the CPP with smaller parties securing the remainder.
The royalists may not have won enough seats in the new 120-member assembly
to form a government on their own, but CPP leaders have been stung by the
government's apparent defeat and are challenging the election results.
Yesterday the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) announced with
regret that the CPP had withdrawn party agents from vote-counting centres in
the pro-Funcinpec provinces of Kandal, Battambang and Kompong Cham. The CPP
has also called for new elections in a further four provinces.
Prince Sihanouk said he had invited his son Prince Ranariddh, the Funcinpec
leader, and Mr Chea Sim, head of the CPP, to lunch at his palace in Phnom
Penh to resolve the problems facing Cambodia, 'given the major dangers which
our people, our nation and our country could face in the days and weeks
ahead.' Prince Sihanouk said both parties were winners in the poll.
His half-brother Prince Sirivudh, who is in charge of Funcinpec's Phnom Penh
office, yesterday expressed concern about continuing government attacks on
Funcinpec supporters in the provinces. He dismissed CPP threats of
insurrection over alleged election fraud as 'blackmail.'
Untac, together with the foreign governments supporting its Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) mission to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia, has already
rejected the CPP's accusations.
'I hope we don't go back to the jungle,' Prince Sirivudh told reporters. 'I
hope we don't go back to fighting again. . . You spend Dollars 2bn on this
operation to do what? To see fighting in Cambodia?'
Prince Sirivudh said Prince Ranariddh wanted to return to Phnom Penh as soon
as possible from a Funcinpec enclave on the Thai border to begin talks.
However, he was unable to do so because the outgoing CPP-led government
would not allow his aircraft to land at the main airport; Prince Chakrapong,
another member of the royal family who is loyal to the CPP and has a feud
with Prince Ranariddh, is in charge of civil aviation.
While Untac is preparing to spend up to Dollars 7m a month to pay soldiers
and civil servants until the new assembly writes a constitution and forms a
new government, Cambodian politicians and foreign diplomats are looking to
the paternalist but erratic Prince Sihanouk to broker a coalition.
'I think he is still the father of the nation,' said Prince Sirivudh. 'He
still sticks to national reconciliation for all his children.'

FT  03 JUN 93 / China moves to cut forex restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA HAS taken an important step towards liberalising its economy by
loosening some restrictions on its exchange rate.
The move was not announced publicly, but an official of the State
Administration of Exchange Control confirmed that restrictions had been
eased on the rate at which China's currency, the yuan, trades in officially
controlled swap centres where the bulk of foreign exchange transactions are
conducted.
The result was an effective devaluation of the yuan, which slipped in
dealings at the Beijing swap centre to close yesterday at Yuan 10.2 to the
dollar, compared with just over Yuan 8 on Monday.
The new rate is close to the that available on the active street market,
though the administered 'official' rate, used largely for trade transactions
under the state plan, remains at Yuan 5.7 to the dollar. The swap market
rate has slid by more than 50 per cent against the official rate in the past
year.
Western officials believe pressure from foreign business and institutions
such as the International Monetary Fund pushed the authorities into measures
aimed at restoring order to the currency markets.
Business had argued that uncertainty over the value of the yuan, accompanied
by fears of a continued depreciation, was undermining investor confidence.
Joint ventures have complained of difficulties of access to foreign exchange
in the swap centres.
In spite of these concerns, foreign investment in China has continued to
climb steeply. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation said
yesterday that 17,500 projects involving foreign capital had been approved
in the first quarter of 1993, up 320 per cent on the same period in 1992.
Nearly Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16bn) in foreign investment was committed, and
actual investment in the first quarter reached Dollars 3bn, up 167 per cent
on last year.
Foreign economists saw the currency move as a step towards unifying China's
exchange rates. A western official said: 'This is a pretty gutsy move. Let
us hope this helps to stabilise the rate and allows the Chinese to move
forward on unification.' But a European banker said the authorities faced
the danger that fears of continuing depreciation, accompanied by demand
created by a surge in imports, would fuel speculative pressure against the
yuan.
This week's move on currency reform may indicate that the authorities are
planning to resort to 'administrative measures' to crack down on the black
market.
China's central bankers are also letting it be known they intend soon to
phase out Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) issued to foreigners since
the 1980s as a second tier currency. FECs have outlived their usefulness now
that China's economy has been further opened.
The US treasury in a report to Congress last month strongly urged China to
reform its exchange system as a step towards redressing a ballooning trade
imbalance. China's trade surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 18bn in 1992.
The report also noted that China's re-entry to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would depend on moves towards unification.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Jordan gets firm hand as times are changing: The appointment
of a new prime minister in the run-up to multi-party elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JORDAN's new government, announced at the weekend, has an unenviable brief:
continue with the country's unpopular economic reforms while deciding
whether, in the face of fierce Islamic fundamentalist opposition, to change
the electoral system before the country's first multi-party elections since
1956.
The man King Hussein has appointed as prime minister to oversee these tasks
is Dr Abdul-Salam Al Majali, Jordan's chief Middle East peace negotiator.
Dr Majali - who also holds the key portfolios of defence and foreign affairs
 -replaces Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker, who asked to stand down. He is expected
to employ a firm hand in dealings with the kingdom's new political parties,
legalised last year, in the run-up to the election in November and in
implementing the economic reforms.
Anxiety over the elections and the threat of an Islamic fundamentalist
majority in the lower house of parliament was expressed by the king when he
appointed Dr Majali.
'I fear for our democracy . . . (and) I warn against those who infiltrate
our ranks under the pretext that they believe in this democracy but in
reality harbour evil and harm,' the king said.
The voting reform would involve changing the 1986 election law to a
one-person, one-vote system. This is expected to cut the number of votes for
fundamentalist candidates.
Under the current law, each voter casts more than one vote, depending on the
number of seats in their constituency - up to eight in some constituencies.
This favours large political groups, such as the fundamentalists, who are
able to field a number of candidates in all constituencies. A one-man,
one-vote system would limit the likelihood of fundamentalist MPs gaining
seats as a second or third choice.
This is opposed by members of the powerful Moslem Brotherhood, the
fundamentalist religious grouping seeking to 'Islamicise' Jordan. They have
said that any changes in the electoral system would be taken as an
infringement of their democratic rights.
In the last elections of 1989, in which parties were not allowed to
participate, fundamentalist candidates captured the largest bloc of 30 out
of 80 seats. Of the 17 parties expected to campaign this time, the party
political wing of the Brotherhood, the Islamic Action Front, is by far the
strongest and best organised.
A change in the electoral law is thought to be supported by the palace and
the new government.
Dr Majali's appointment is also viewed as demonstrating Jordan's commitment
to the flagging Arab-Israeli peace talks, which continue to disillusion a
growing number of Jordanians and Palestinians in the kingdom.
Dr Majali is one of the few Jordanians to deal publicly with the Israelis -
an act of treason according to the Moslem Brotherhood. His appointment sends
a strong signal to fundamentalists that their calls for a withdrawal from
the peace talks will gain no political election mileage.
Then there is a controversial sales tax, averaging 5-10 per cent, which was
postponed by the previous cabinet because of domestic opposition,
particularly from the private sector.
The tax, framed by the International Monetary Fund as part of the kingdom's
economic restructuring programme, will replace the old consumption tax.
But many Jordanians fear that the new tax structure will lead to severe
price rises.
The IMF has stipulated that the sales tax must be enforced before Jordan's
next round of foreign debt rescheduling talks due early next month. The
kingdom's foreign debt is about Dollars 6.5bn or 140 per cent of gross
domestic product.
The new head of Jordan's negotiating team is expected to be Fayez Tarawneh,
Jordan's ambassador to Washington.

FT  03 JUN 93 / France prepares bill to tighten foreign entry rules: FT
writers assess the immigration crisis in W Europe as EC ministers in
Copenhagen agree tougher guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S new conservative government yesterday approved a draft bill to
tighten curbs on immigration, which Mr Charles Pasqua, its hard-line
interior minister, wants to bring close to zero, David Buchan reports from
Paris.
The bill, whose passage through parliament is ensured by the conservatives'
large majority, would set tougher rules on the entry and stay of foreigners
in France. The country has been taking about 100,000 immigrants a year,
about a third of them admitted in order to join members of their families
already in France.
The new bill would require foreigners to be legally resident in France for
two years before their families could join them. This would not, however,
affect citizens of other EC countries, nor is it expected to apply to
expatriate employees of foreign companies in France.
Polygamists or students would be barred from having their families join them
in France. To crack down on marriages of convenience, foreigners would only
get French citizenship a year after their marriage to a French spouse and on
proof of cohabitation.
The tougher rules on family reunification, which also enshrine the right to
political asylum in French law for the first time, follow recent legislative
moves to narrow eligibility for French citizenship and to widen police
powers to make spot identity checks. They also coincide with unemployment,
rising sharply to 3.1m or 10.9 per cent of the workforce in April, and
economic recession.
Mr Pasqua cited this when he told Le Monde newspaper this week that France
could no longer be considered a country of immigration.
In contrast, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday at the close of the
Franco-German summit in Burgundy that Germany 'must remain a country
hospitable and welcoming' to foreigners.
The German leader was admittedly reacting to the tragedy at Solingen last
Saturday in which five Turks died in an arson attack blamed on right-wing
extremists.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Anti-German sentiment of Turks hardens: FT writers assess
the immigration crisis in W Europe as EC ministers in Copenhagen agree
tougher guidelines
</HEADLINE>

   SOLINGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL a few days ago, Onder Daloglu, a 19-year-old Turk born in Germany, had
one dream. He wanted to be a German policeman. Last month, he passed the
exam required to enter the police training course and the same day he
applied for German citizenship.
He never imagined that within weeks he would find himself shoulder to
shoulder with fellow Turks charging shielded German police. Yet for four
consecutive nights in Solingen, that's just what he has been doing.
'Tomorrow, I will cancel my citizenship application,' he says, taking a
break from the riots which have shaken his local town since five Turks died
last Saturday in an arson attack blamed on teenage neo-Nazis.
Onder Daloglu, like the hundreds of other young Turks on the streets of
Solingen, has never felt as Turkish as in the last few violent days.
The continuing wave of attacks against foreigners is hardening the
anti-German sentiment of the country's 1.8m Turks and posing serious
questions over how Germany's largest foreign community can be integrated.
Reacting to the Solingen deaths, Turkish organisations all over Germany have
demanded greater political rights for their compatriots, most of whom
arrived in the 1960s and 1970s following a 1961 labour agreement between
Turkey and Germany.
At the moment, foreigners applying for German citizenship face some of the
toughest requirements in Europe. A minimum of 10 years' residence is needed,
while foreigners born in Germany must have lived there for at least eight
years.
Along with the opposition Social Democrats, Turkish organisations say these
conditions should be eased. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, together with the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian
sister party, have so far refused to dilute the access to German
citizenship, based on a 1913 law.
'Foreigners, foreigners, that's all our children, born in Germany, have
heard since nursery school,' says Mr Ahrmet Aktas, leader of the Turkish
community in Essen, as he walks down the streets of Solingen, shaking hands
with young Turks wearing flags and nationalistic emblems. 'We must give them
the chance to feel German and to vote,' he adds, echoing the feelings of
other Turkish leaders. The recent spate of violence has prompted the German
government to devise a tougher immigration policy, but integration may prove
harder.
Many Turkish organisations are calling for dual citizenship. Turks in
Germany have been unwilling to renounce their Turkish nationality and opt
for a German passport.
'Our people here are not ready to give up their Turkish identity. Germany
has never shown them that they belonged here. How can they trust they will
be at home here, especially now?' explains Mr Hakki Keskin from the Alliance
of Turkish Immigrants in Hamburg.
Smoking a cigarette in front of the Turkish restaurant his parents run,
Onder is watching the streets eagerly. He wants to make sure he doesn't miss
the neo-Nazis expected in Solingen tonight. 'Defend the Germans? No, not
really. That's no longer what I will do with my life,' he says, looking back
at his father who is busy feeding the demonstrators.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Europe tries to shut the floodgates

FT writers assess the immigration crisis in W Europe as EC ministers in
Copenhagen agree tougher guidelines
WESTERN Europe is turning to stricter border controls, tougher police
methods and deportations in its struggle to keep out a tide of unwanted and
illegal immigrants.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the hard-line interior minister in France's new
conservative government, yesterday announced that France did not want to be
a country of immigration any longer. 'The objective we have set ourselves is
zero immigration,' he told Le Monde, on the same day as he presented draft
legislation restricting immigrants' rights to family reunion and extending
police powers.
Last week in Bonn, despite heavy street protests from demonstrating
liberals, the German Bundestag revised the constitution to tighten up the
country's asylum laws. Yesterday in Copenhagen, European Community
governments agreed tougher guidelines for combating illegal immigration.
It is the asylum seekers, demanding the right of asylum under the 1951
United Nations convention that have prompted the most anxiety. Ten years ago
the total number of people seeking asylum in 23 European countries, from
Poland to Portugal, was just over 71,000. Last year the figure was over
700,000.
Over 2m people have claimed asylum in European countries in the past four
years. Small numbers have now started claiming asylum in eastern Europe, but
the overwhelming majority have sought entry into western Europe.
Cumulatively, Germany has taken over 1m asylum seekers during the past four
years - more than half the European total - with 438,000 registered last
year. The scale of the influx helps explain the waves of violent xenophobia
in Germany, which culminated this week in the killing of five Turks in
Solingen.
Germany has been the chief destination of people fleeing from war,
starvation and persecution because its asylum law has until now been the
most liberal. But all of western Europe has been affected by the wars and
political disintegration that have followed the end of the cold war. Sweden
received 3,000 asylum requests 10 years ago; last year it had 83,000, France
received 27,000, and Britain 25,000.
Now at crisis point, most European countries are introducing tighter
restrictions. Austria has hardened its asylum law, a new asylum law is
before parliament in Spain, the Netherlands has introduced tougher
legislation, and a new asylum law is going through the British parliament.
There are limits to governments' freedom to change their asylum laws,
however. Under the UN Convention, asylum is not a privilege which
governments may give or withhold arbitrarily; it is a right which they are
required to extend to any individual who can show a 'well-founded fear of
being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group or political opinion'.
Since asylum is granted individually, each application must be examined and
decided individually. which, with the recent surge in asylum seekers, has
meant a large backlog. The principle is manifestly unsuited to large waves
of people escaping from civil war or political disintegration.
Those fleeing the fighting in Somalia or the former Yugoslavia, are
obviously not just 'economic migrants' seeking a more comfortable life, as
right-wing politicians sometimes claim. On the other hand, they may not meet
the criteria of the Convention. Governments are thus caught between the
desire to shut out all illegitimate immigrants, and the reluctant
recognition that many of them simply can not, on humanitarian grounds, be
sent back where they came from.
As a result, the migrant flood has spawned a whole new category of people
who are neither given formal refugee status, nor expelled. In most
countries, asylum is granted in only a minority of cases, and the proportion
has fallen as numbers of applicants have risen.
Last year in Britain, just under 6 per cent of decisions were positive and
20 per cent were negative; but 74 per cent were neither, instead receiving
'Exceptional Leave to Remain'.
According to a 15-country study by the European Consultation on Refugees and
Exiles (Ecre), the umbrella organisation for European refugee groups, 'at
least 80 per cent of all rejected asylum seekers remain in one way or
another'. The good news from a humanitarian point of view is that they are
not sent back to their civil war. The bad news is that their civil rights
are far fewer than under asylum status.
In Germany, Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands, this lesser right to
remain is short-term, usually for a year at a time. It gives no right to a
travel document, and no right to family reunion. In France, Belgium, Greece
and Italy, de facto refugees are left in limbo without any rights at all.
In response to an appeal from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some
western countries have agreed to take in small numbers of victims of the war
in Bosnia. However, they have given them a new and still more precarious
status of 'temporary protection', usually valid for only six months.
After last week's vote in Germany, any asylum seeker who comes through a
'safe' neighbouring country can be sent back there. This will bring German
policy in line with Community principles, as agreed in Dublin in 1990. But
many experts doubt the policy will work in practice: if asylum is
unavailable, would-be migrants will simply go underground.
The European Consultation on Refugees believes that the concept of asylum
should be revised and broadened to bring it into line with the facts in the
real world; and ideally, the 12 should develop a European Asylum Agreement.
Mr Philip Rudge, the general secretary of Ecre, is openly contemptuous of
the results of this week's Copenhagen meeting. 'This is just a temporary
holding operation', he says. 'They have not yet reached the maturity for a
comprehensive, shared European refugee policy. It is called the Ad Hoc Group
on Immigration: it is brilliantly named'.

<TEXT>
SIX Christian Democrat leaders headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl last night
agreed in principle to convene a special EC summitimmediately after full
ratification of the Maastricht treaty to relaunch the drive to political and
monetary union.
The move underlines impatience among federalist-minded Europeans at the
delay in ratifying the treaty and their determination to put all aspects of
Maastricht into force, whatever the reservations in Britain.
Meeting in Brussels yesterday were the heads of government of Germany,
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Greece as well as the Italian
foreign minister.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said last night the summit
could help end uncertainty about the EC's future. 'It would send a message
to Europe that we know where we are going.'
A more specific goal would be to settle the site of the European Monetary
Institute, forerunner of a European central bank in the planned monetary
union (Emu).
Prospects for agreement at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen are
considered slim, but the EMI is due to start operation next January 1 - the
official launch of the second stage of Emu.
The idea of an special summit emerged during talks between Chancellor Kohl,
President Francois Mitterrand, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France
which ended in Beaune yesterday. The Christian Democrat leaders gave the
initiative broad support without taking a final decision.
Mr Dehaene, who will chair EC heads of government meetings when Belgium
takes over the EC presidency on July 1, said he needed to discuss it with
his coalition partners.

EC interior and justice ministers yesterday decided to set up a joint
anti-drugs squad from next month, as part of an effort to prevent organised
crime exploiting the Community's barrier-free single market. The unit,
designed to pool intelligence and develop a combined strategy against
narcotics trafficking, will come under Europol, the criminal intelligence
office called for by EC heads of government two years ago.
However, Europol is still not operational. In an embryonic and
under-employed form, it has a temporary headquarters in Strasbourg. Getting
it beyond that stage awaits a convention to accommodate the differing civil
liberties traditions of the Twelve, and a decision on where to locate new EC
bodies - delayed by competing claims.
The ministers nevertheless felt it was sufficiently urgent to get an EC
anti-drugs effort up and running in advance of these decisions.
If the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22 does not resolve the issue, the
interior ministers intend to meet again on June 29 to agree a temporary site
for the drugs unit.
The squad itself will have a staff of about 70, each member state seconding
officers to it. Liaison between member states and the analysis of
intelligence will be its main work, overseen by the interior ministers, who
now meet as the secretive Trevi group.
Ministers also agreed recommendations to tighten up on money laundering and
the organised crime activities of motorcycle gangs, and to examine ways of
combatting the traffic in women and children for prostitution, and the
illegal transport of toxic waste.

The European Commission yesterday adopted plans to make the conduct of EC
business less secretive, establishing the principle that most EC documents
should be made available on demand, writes Lionel Barber. It is also moving
tentatively toward creation of a register of lobbyists, but both these moves
depend on agreement with the European parliament.
A database would be set up on interest groups which would be open to the
parliament, Commission and public. Also planned is a directory of all
non-profit organisations; commercial groups would form their own register
and a draft code of conduct.
Under the new guidelines, documents would remain confidential if their
disclosure were judged damaging to national security, monetary stability,
judicial procedures, commercial confidentiality, personal privacy, or the
EC's financial interests.

being lost in 1992, according to a report by the Irish Business and

than losses through strikes.
The report said 4.5 per cent of available working time was being lost in

writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. A day earlier, he had signed an
election law which promises to cut the number of parties in the next
parliament.
The election will still be held under the proportional representation system
which in 1991 introduced over 20 political groups into the last parliament.
But those parties which fail to get 5 per cent of the national vote will not

MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the former prime minister who launched market reforms in

He said yesterday that the new Association of Privatised and Private
Businesses, of which he is president, would promote the political interests
of a new class of property owners, as well as help former state-owned
enterprises operate like market-driven companies elsewhere in the world.
Mr Pyotr Filippov, the association's vice-president, said it would try to
substitute for Russia's lack of strong political parties by rallying
qualified candidates around a single reformist bloc to produce 'a
pro-market, anti-inflationary parliament'.

ITALY PROTESTED to the rump state of Yugoslavia yesterday after a Yugoslav
gunboat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat in the Adriatic, killing a
crewman and injuring another, agencies report from Rome.
The Italians demanded the release of the damaged fishing boat, being held at
the Montenegrin port of Bar along with its captain and two crewmen. The
Italian navy was ordered to step up patrols in the area and use all
necessary force to prevent another attack on an Italian vessel.
The incident is likely to compound Rome's exasperation at events in the
former Yugoslav republics.
Italy is already taking part in a naval blockade of Yugoslav ports with its
partners in Nato and the 10-nation Western European Union.
The clash, which the Italians said apparently occurred in international
waters, comes just days after three Italian civilians were killed while
delivering aid in central Bosnia.
Four Italian airmen were killed when their UN helicopter was shot down by
Serb fighters last year. A further four died when their aircraft was brought
down on a mercy flight to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, last September.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Bomb defused in Rome near PM's office
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROME police yesterday defused a car bomb placed in a narrow street within
200 yards of the prime minister's office and parliament. Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, prime minister, who was in talks with representatives of unions and
employers, declined to evacuate his office and pressed ahead with the
meeting.
The authorities immediately claimed the incident was part of a campaign to
destabilise Italy. It followed the two car bombs in Rome and Florence since
May 14, killing five people and damaging the famed Uffizi Gallery.
The discovery of yesterday's bomb in the heart of Rome at midday has
increased the pressure on the authorities to pinpoint those behind the
campaign. The two previous car bombs have been blamed on the Mafia but there
is a strong suspicion that elements of the security services - long linked
to right-wing extremist groups and the secret Masonic lodge P2 - might be
involved.
The government is understood to be considering ways of reorganising the
security services, which have always been a law unto themselves.
'It is no accident,' commented Mr Ugo Pecchioli, deputy of the Party of the
Democratic Left, 'that every time in Italy's recent history there begins to
be a change in the existing balance of power, events occur like this
morning's which seek to condition the democratic outcome.'
The recently stolen car involved in yesterday's incident contained 20kg of a
mixture of ammonium nitrate and petrol, plus a detonator. Such a mixture has
been used by neo-Fascist groups in Tuscany and is different from that
employed in the Rome and Florence attacks.
Responsibility for planting the bomb was claimed by Armed Falange, the same
organisation which said it was behind the two previous bombs; but the
authorities have so far not taken these calls seriously.
Officials said the car bomb appeared deliberately timed to coincide with
yesterday's celebrations of Republic Day (the first car bomb went off on
National Police Day).
Although the Mafia is being linked to the destabilising campaign, the
government yesterday was able to announce another success against Cosa
Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. Security forces
arrested Mr Giuseppe Pulvirenti, the most wanted boss in eastern Sicily and
head of a well-armed clan in the Catania region. He had been on the run for
11 years.
His arrest followed that of Mr Nito Santapaola on May 18, the acknowledged
boss of the Catania Mafia and the most wanted man in Sicily following the
arrest in January of Mr 'Toto' Riina, considered the 'boss of bosses'. The
arrest also underlined the crackdown under way in Sicily both against Cosa
Nostra and those with links to it.

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS within Hungary's governing conservative party, the Hungarian
Democratic Forum (HDF), have led to an open split which could lead to the
party's defeat in parliament and an early general election.
HDF members voted late on Tuesday to expel Mr Istvan Csurka and three other
right-wing nationalists from the parliamentary party. Mr Csurka, is a
well-known writer and author of an anti-Communist and anti-semitic manifesto
which threw Hungarian politics into turmoil when published last August.
Three far-right associates were also cast out including Ms Izabella Kiraly,
a campaigner for the 'peaceful reunification' of the Carpathian basin once
ruled by Hungary. Mrs Kiraly has organised a demonstration tomorrow against
the 1920 Trianon treaty, which took away two thirds of former
Hungarian-controlled territory and left more than 3m ethnic Hungarians as
minorities in neighbouring Romania, Slovakia, Croatia and Serbia.
A nation-wide HDF party meeting this weekend is set to confirm the
expulsions and sanction the resulting split. It remains to be seen how many
MPs from Mr Csurka's Hungarian Justice faction will follow him out of the
HDF.
Government officials hope that only 10 MPs are solidly behind the populist
leader, but a defection by all or most of the 29 Justice faction MPs would
cost the government headed by Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, its
parliamentary majority.
Hungary's constitution makes it difficult for parliament to pass motions of
no-confidence, but Mr Antall said this week that he was unwilling to lead a
minority government. The Antall government has enjoyed a longevity unmatched
in eastern Europe. But ministers, previously determined to survive until
elections scheduled for May 1994, are now for the first time talking openly
about the possibility of an early vote.
The first test of the Forum's majority will be the parliamentary vote on
measures to bring the public-sector deficit down to 5.6 per cent of GDP in
1994 in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund.
Protests against the government's proposed austerity measures are making it
more difficult to keep parliament in line. Teachers this week demonstrated
against the planned freeze on public-sector pay and the public is irate at
the government's intention to increase value-added tax on food,
pharmaceuticals and household heating.

<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday papered over their tactical differences on
Bosnia with a joint declaration stressing the two countries had not given up
on the eventual aim of guaranteeing 'the territorial integrity and
sovereignty' of the war-torn republic.
Restating this goal of the Vance-Owen peace plan was designed to allay the
impression, drawn from the recent 'Washington action plan', that the
international community had conceded victory to the Serbs in Bosnia, and was
only interested in sheltering the dispossesed Moslem refugees in designated
'safe areas' and ensuring the safety of its own peacekeepers.
The Washington plan had drawn sharp criticism from Germany which had no hand
in its drafting. Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister who was present at
yesterday's Franco-German summit in Beaune, was quoted as calling the plan
'morally catastrophic'.
At yesterday's press conference concluding the bilateral summit, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl pointed with satisfaction to the declaration's 'refusal to
accept (Serb) gains won by armed force'.
In return, Germany promised its backing for France's proposal for the United
Nations Security Council to extend the mandate of UN troops to cover
protection of Bosnia's civil population.
Having overcome the 'misunderstanding' on Bosnia, Mr Kohl gave general
backing to the idea of Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, for a new
European conference to draw lessons from the Yugoslav tragedy and to plan
for Europe's future security.
Mr Balladur, with the support of President Mitterrand signalled that the
security conference idea may be presented jointly to the EC's forthcoming
Copenhagen summit.
France and Germany are also likely to present their own slant on the jobs
and economic growth initative being prepared by the European Commission for
Copenhagen, Mr Balladur said. He deplored Europe's situation as having 'the
weakest growth and highest short-term interest rates' of any major region in
the world.
France's trade surplus rose in February to FFr4.76bn, (Pounds 560m) up from
FFr3.3bn in January, the country's customs service reported yesterday.

SERBIA'S President Slobodan Milosevic came under stinging attack yesterday
over the arrest and beating of more than 20 opposition politicians and
journalists in Belgrade.
Leaders of Serbia's democratic opposition denounced the violent crackdown -
in the wake of the ousting of Yugoslav federal president Dobrica Cosic
earlier this week - as 'a brutal crime'. Mr Cosic, too, breaking his
silence, added to the criticism of the Serbian leader, likening him to
Hitler.
Democratic politicians demanded the release of those arrested and the
resignation of the interior minister.
But their call for a mass demonstration outside the federal parliament
yesterday went unheeded. The violence with which police broke up Tuesday
night's protest against the removal of Mr Cosic apparently succeeded in
intimidating opposition supporters.
Serbia's democratic opposition has become increasingly marginal as radical
nationalist leaders, backed by paramilitary groups, have gained ground.
'There is a new ascendancy of the ex-Communists. We are heading for worse
troubles,' said Mr Borislav Mihailovic, a member of Depos, a coalition of
democratic groups.
On Tuesday night police fired rubber bullets and tear-gas at several
thousand people gathered outside parliament, the largest demonstration in
Belgrade for more than two years. One police officer died from gunshot
wounds and more than 30 people were injured in street battles.
Mr Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), the largest
opposition party, was in serious condition with a fractured jaw and other
injuries after he was beaten by police who burst into the party offices
early yesterday morning, an SPO spokesman said.
Mr Draskovic, a charismatic figure who led violent demonstrations against
the Milosevic government in 1991, was arrested with senior party officials
and local journalists.
Mr Nicola Milosevic, head of the Serb Liberal party, said it was 'an
unprecedently violent action instigated by Slobodan Milosevic and his
police. It is a totalitarian regime that arrests the leader of the biggest
opposition party'.
Commenting on his ousting by radical Serbs backed by socialists in the
federal parliament, Mr Cosic accused President Milosevic of 'despotic
self-will' and a 'classical Stalinist act'. In an allusion to Adolf Hitler,
Mr Cosic described the Serbian president, a former ally, as 'Fuhrer of the
Serbian Radical Party'.
Bosnian Serb troops were reported to be closing in on the Moslem enclave of
Gorazde yesterday, as an upsurge of fighting threatened to disrupt aid
operations across the former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
The UN yesterday halted relief flights to Sarajevo after snipers wounded
four French soldiers and a US relief aircraft was hit by a bullet. A Belgian
TV cameraman was killed by a sniper in central Bosnia.

The UN yesterday halted relief flights to Sarajevo after snipers wounded
four French soldiers and a US relief aircraft was hit by a bullet.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Doubt cast on single currency goal: Schlesinger says EC's
1997 target 'increasingly improbable'

<TEXT>
THE target of creating a single European currency by 1997 was 'increasingly
improbable', Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, admitted
yesterday.
He insisted that the strict convergence criteria for economic and monetary
union had to be maintained, in spite of fears that few, if any, European
Community members will be able to meet them during the current recession.
Yet he went on to suggest that one of the criteria - that government debt
must be reduced to 60 per cent of gross national product - might be less
critical than those controlling inflation and current budget deficits.
Speaking to German bankers in Bonn, Mr Schlesinger rejected recent fears of
'competitive devaluations' by European currencies, warning that such charges
could undermine co-operation in the European Monetary System.
He defended the recent performance of the exchange rate mechanism of the
EMS, on the grounds that those currencies based on 'stable fundamentals'
like the French franc had been successfully defended against speculative
attacks.
Mr Schlesinger said that the changes within the EMS had been a process of
correcting unrealistic exchange rates - in particular those of sterling, the
lira, peseta and escudo - and not 'competitive devaluation'.
He declared that the D-Mark was no longer the single dominant currency
within the ERM, but sought to counter any suggestion that it was itself
heading for devaluation.
In a wide-ranging speech in which he set himself firmly against any
acceleration in the current process of gradual interest rate cuts in the
lead rates on the German money markets, Mr Schlesinger also rejected claims
that the German economy was facing its deepest recession since the war. He
warned, however, that the recession could get worse unless the government
acted urgently to cut its budget deficit, including unpopular cuts in social
spending.
Mr Schlesinger admitted that the importance of the D-Mark as the world's
second reserve currency meant that the country faced daily re-assessment by
the international financial markets, 'and we do not always provide good
news'. Yet in spite of all the structural problems of unification, the ever
increasing public sector deficits, and the deficit on the current account of
the balance of payments, the D-Mark had not suffered any serious loss of
confidence.
As for the long-term future of European economic and monetary union, he said
it would still need big efforts for member states to fulfil the economic
convergence criteria.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Poll could turn spotlight on Juan Carlos
 -Hung parliament would hand the king a tricky role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Spain's 30m voters next Sunday elect the hung parliament suggested by
opinion polls, King Juan Carlos will face the most delicate task of his
18-year reign as a constitutional monarch. He will be required to fine tune
his political instincts in order to choose a candidate for prime minister
capable of gaining a majority in parliament. It is a role that Belgium's
King Baudouin has often been called upon to play but in Juan Carlos' Spain
it is quite novel.
Under Spain's constitution, the monarch must consult the leaders of the
political parties following a general election and ask one of them to form a
government. The selected politician must then win the endorsement of
parliament, through what is called the investiture debate.
In the five elections that have taken place since democracy was restored
following General Franco's death in 1975, voters returned a clear governing
majority and made the monarch's task a mere formality. 'This time the king's
consultations will really have a purpose,' Mr Miguel Herrero de Minon, a
constitutional expert who helped frame the constitution, said yesterday.
If the election does produce a hung parliament, it could take at least six
weeks for a prime minister and a new government to emerge. For a start, the
monarch cannot begin to sound out political leaders and assess the new
balance of power until the 350-member parliament elects its speaker on June
29 when it first meets.
The constitution says the monarch can only summon politicians to the royal
palace by issuing invitations through the speaker. This time gap is to allow
for recounts in contested seats.
The vote for speaker should indicate what political alliances the
parliamentary parties can be expected to forge in the subsequent investiture
vote to endorse the king's candidate for prime minister. At present the
investiture vote is tentatively scheduled to take place in mid-July,
One snag could be that the parties might be unable to agree immediately on a
speaker, a development which could further delay the emergence of a
government.
The monarch is not obliged by the constitution to nominate the leader of the
parliamentary party that has won the most seats in parliament. The purpose
of his consultations with the politicians will be to choose which of them
will be most likely to pass the investiture hurdle and lead a strong
coalition government. The closer the vote on Sunday, the more lengthy the
consultations are expected to be.
On the basis of the opinion polls the two majority parties, the Socialist
and the centre-right People's Party, will be so far short of a working
majority that they will need the support of at least two minority parties to
form a government. The potential partners for either are the Catalan and the
Basque nationalists, but it will, in all likelihood, be up to the king to
broker such an implicit or explicit coalition.
Should Juan Carlos's initial candidate fail to be endorsed in the
investiture debate next month, the constitution lays down a new round of
consultations and the nomination of a second candidate. There is no limit to
the number of candidates the king can propose, nor does he, according to
strict letter of the constitution, have to nominate an elected member of
parliament.
In the event of a deadlock, Juan Carlos can in theory nominate an
independent candidate, much in the manner that Italy's President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro invited Mr Carlo Ciampi, the former governor of the central bank,
to form a government.
However, unlike Italy's constitution, Spain's has a built-in safeguard to a
prolonged parliamentary paralysis. After the parliamentary vote to elect
Juan Carlos's candidate, the constitutional clock starts ticking. Should the
new legislature fail to elect a new prime minister within two months, it is
automatically dissolved and new elections will have to be held not later
than two months later.

<TEXT>
The Ukrainian parliament yesterday blocked President Leonid Kravchuk's bid
for additional power. It also refused to give Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime
minister, the extraordinary authority over the economy he requested, writes
Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. It is unclear whether Mr Kuchma will agree to
stay in office, having threatened to resign unless he had his way.
Parliament's vote is a serious defeat for Mr Kravchuk, who last month
undermined his prime minister's request for greater economic authority by
launching his own bid for extra powers.
The parliamentary speaker, Mr Ivan Pliushch, put the president's proposed
constitutional amendments to two ballots but still failed to push them
through.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Call to cut European interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday urged Japan and Germany to boost their economies as a
report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
warned that unemployment in the industrial world was reaching 'alarming'
levels.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, called for Japan to increase
its fiscal stimulus and for 'further substantial reductions' of European
interest rates to promote faster growth. His thinly veiled call on the
Bundesbank to cut its interest rates was backed by the European Commission.
Mr Henning Christophersen, commissioner for economic affairs, said further
reductions in short and long-term European rates were needed. All European
Community states could do more, he added.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Drop in cash growth raises fears for economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP DROP in the growth of cash in circulation last month has added to
doubts about the strength of UK economic recovery and raised expectations
for another cut in interest rates.
Bank of England figures yesterday showed that M0, the narrow measure of the
money supply - mainly notes and coins in circulation - grew a seasonally
adjusted 3.3 per cent in the year to May, compared with growth of 4.8 per
cent in the year to April.
The slowdown in the annual rate of growth pointed towards a weakening in
consumer spending and a slow and patchy recovery for the UK.
The pound continued to weaken against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges,
as the market took the view that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor,
would cut interest rates. Sterling closed at DM2.4625, down  3/4 of a
pfennig on the day. It closed 1 cent down against the dollar at Dollars
1.541 - its closing figure in New York.
The UK stock market was also buoyed by speculation of another easing in
monetary policy. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading industrial shares closed at
2,863, up 13.8 points on the day. Compared with April, M0 fell by 1.1 per
cent, the sharpest monthly fall for over 10 years. The fall took the annual
growth rate of M0 back within the government's monitor range of 0-4 per cent
for the first time since January.
The provisional figures were the latest in a string of indicators pointing
towards a bumpy UK recovery. As a fairly good indicator of the pace of
consumer spending, the latest drop in M0 suggests there was some weakening
in retail activity in May after strong first quarter growth.
'It is very clear taking the April and May figures together that the trend
in M0 is now downwards,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Midland
Global Markets.
The drop in M0 in May was exaggerated by low bank operational deposits -
accounts held by commercial banks for clearing purposes at the Bank of
England. However, these account for only 1 per cent of total M0. Last
month's figure was depressed by an upward blip to M0 recorded in May last
year. It may have been affected by the two bank holidays in May, when
traditionally spending patterns alter.
The Bank of England also released final money supply figures for April.
These confirmed that growth in broad money has remained depressed in recent
months. In the year to April M4 - M0 plus bank deposits -  1/2 grew a
seasonally adjusted 3.5 per cent, compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to
March.

FT  03 JUN 93 / BA faces disruption as union calls 24 hour strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS faces severe disruption worldwide from midnight tonight when
its 17,000 cabin crew and ground staff will go on strike for 24 hours.
In a surprise move last night, the Transport and General Workers' Union
called its members out after talks yesterday failed to resolve a dispute
over pay and conditions.
The dispute arose after the introduction of new conditions for staff at
Gatwick Airport following BA's takeover of Dan-Air last year.
A union spokesman predicted the action would severely disrupt BA's
operations worldwide. 'BA cannot get much off the ground without the T&amp;G,'
he said.
But BA later insisted that its fleet would not be grounded by the action.
'We expect to be able to operate well over half of our intercontinental
services and a considerable number of our European and domestic services in
the event of strike action,' the company said.
Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said: 'British Airways have
failed to address the basic concerns of our members over the contracting out
of services and the transferring of work to newly-created subsidiary
companies.
'These policies have undermined job security for BA employees, which is why
our members have voted clearly for strike action in a secret ballot.
'I regret that BA have failed to respond to our efforts to seek a settlement
to this dispute.'
The talks had been adjourned with BA management hoping for a meeting with Mr
Morris to try to resolve the dispute.
BA said last night that the strike would be 'wholly unwarranted' but added
that the company was still hopeful the strike could be averted.
The result of a ballot of 3,000 BA pilots - members of the British Air Line
Pilots' Association - on industrial action over what they claim is an
attempt to introduce poorer pay and conditions should be announced tomorrow.

FT  03 JUN 93 / Soros Pounds 284m investment excites property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY shares rose sharply yesterday after Mr George Soros announced plans
to invest Pounds 284m in the stricken UK property market.
Mr Soros, the international fund manager reputed to have made Pounds 1bn
betting on a devaluation of sterling in the run up to Black Wednesday and
who in April invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) in a gold mining company,
is forming a Pounds 500m partnership with British Land, the fourth biggest
UK property company.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said yesterday's deal underlined his
commitment to the sector's recovery. He said 'signs of recovery . . . are
now more widely discernible'. The deal with Quantum Group, a Dollars 9bn
investment management company advised by Mr Soros, would give 'additional
firepower'.
Mr Ritblat claimed a year ago to have seen a turnaround in the UK property
market, where values have slumped during the recession. He said he had
approached Mr Soros 'a couple of months ago' with the plan. Mr Soros reacted
quickly, he said.
Mr Soros tied up a deal in February with the Reichmann brothers, the
Canadian property developers, to invest in North American property, and in
January he took a 3 per cent stake in Berkeley, the UK housebuilder.
British Land and Quantum are each putting up Pounds 250m, which will be used
to buy a portfolio of properties by the end of 1997. The partnership is
expected to be wound up by 2003. British Land will receive a fee rising to
Pounds 5m a year for managing the portfolio, although both parties will
agree investment decisions.
Quantum is subscribing to 11.3m new shares in British Land, costing Pounds
33.7m, which would give it a 4.8 per cent stake in the company. Quantum will
sell some of these shares to Mr Ritblat and place 4m shares into a British
Land employee trust.
Yesterday's agreement by two such influential investors was seen in the
stockmarket as underlining recovery hopes in the commercial property market.
Falling interest rates and expectations of economic recovery have already
pushed property shares higher. The sector has almost doubled in value since
last September.
The property sector yesterday showed a further 6 per cent rise, with British
Land shares rising 46p to 344p. The market was also excited by the thought
that some of the funds could be used to finance a takeover in the sector.
However, questions were being raised last night over an agreement under
which Mr Ritblat will buy British Land shares from Quantum at 298p,
Tuesday's closing price, and over possible conflicts of interest.
Some investors were concerned about the profit Mr Ritblat would appear to
make on the shares, but British Land defended the deal saying Mr Soros
wanted Mr Ritblat 'to put his money where his mouth is'.
Mr Ritblat is required to hold 4m British Land shares for a year and 2m
shares until the end of 1997.
British Land also announced a Pounds 132m rights issue yesterday to help
finance its share in the partnership with Quantum. The issue is underwritten
by SG Warburg.
The company also reported profits for the year to March 31 up 3.9 per cent
to Pounds 34.6m.

APPLE Computer's Dollars 5.5bn copyright infringement suit against Microsoft
and Hewlett-Packard was dismissed by a federal judge in San Francisco
yesterday. The case was the biggest copyright infringement claim in the
history of the computer industry.
Apple agreed not to contest a motion for dismissal of the case filed by
Microsoft and HP. However, Apple said that it now intends to take the case
to the appeals court.
In its suit, filed five years ago, Apple charged that Microsoft's 'Windows'
program, which has since become a top seller used on millions of personal
computers, infringes copyrights on Apple's Macintosh programs. Apple also
charged that an HP program, 'New Wave,' infringes Macintosh copyrights.
The case has been closely watched because the outcome could have a broad
impact in the computer industry, limiting the publication of 'look-alike'
programs and programs that incorporate features of existing products. The
case was also seen as a threat to the development of easy-to-use graphical
interface programs for IBM-compatible PCs.
However, in a series of interim rulings the court rejected most of Apple's
claims. In particular, the judge dismissed Apple Computer's contention that
the overall 'look and feel' of computer displays should be considered in
determining whether its copyrights were infringed.
Instead, Judge Vaughn Walker compared specific elements of the displays and
ruled that most were not original to Apple or were covered by a prior
licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft. Only a handful of display
elements remained in dispute prior to yesterday's ruling.
Apple said that it chose not to contest the Microsoft, HP motion for
dismissal of the case 'in the interests of judicial economy'. Rather than go
to trial on the few remaining issues in the case, Apple plans to reopen the
case in the appeals court.
Microsoft said, however, that having won the case in the trail court it
would 'vigorously defend this result through any appeal'.

NEW Straits Times Press, Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group,
has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 47.97m (USDollars 18.6m) for the
six months to February 1993. The result is a 3.7 per cent improvement on
last year.
Group turnover rose 9.5 per cent to MDollars 188m, while net earnings per
share improved to 18.4 cents from 17.6 cents previously.
NSTP directors said they expected year-end results to be broadly in line
with those of last year. In the year to August, 1992, NSTP earned pre-tax
profits of MDollars 96m, compared with MDollars 82m the year before.
Until a management buy-out early this year NSTP was part of the Renong
group, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates with close connections to the
ruling United Malays National Organisation.
Renong sold its controlling stake in NSTP, along with a 43 per cent stake in
TV3, the country's only privately-owned TV station, for MDollars 800m.
SIA Engineering, the aircraft engineering subsidiary of Singapore Airlines,
is likely to be one of a number of regional aerospace companies investing in
a Dollars 63m maintenance centre in China.
Aviation sources say SIA is negotiating to take a 15 per cent stake in the
new aerospace facility, to be built near the coastal city of Xiamen.
The prime mover behind the China project is the Hong Kong Aircraft
Engineering (Haeco). Others said to be involved are Cathay Pacific, the Hong
Kong carrier, Japan Airlines, and local Chinese interests.
Haeco's move to China is prompted by space restrictions in Hong Kong and
lower Chinese wage rates. In recent years, several aerospace centres in Asia
have been opened in response to the sharp increase in regional aircraft
traffic.
The International Air Transport Association forecasts that airline passenger
numbers will double in the Asia Pacific region over the next six years.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Restructured Borthwicks Pounds 2m in the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORTHWICKS, the flavourings maker, yesterday reported a swing from profits
of Pounds 1.29m to losses of Pounds 1.99m pre-tax for the 12 months ended
March 27 at the end of 13 years of restructuring.
The deficit mainly reflected the one-off cost of disposing of loss-making
meat interests and concealed operating profits on continuing operations of
Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.53m) after stripping out losses from businesses now
sold.
Comparisons have been re-stated to comply with the FRS 3 accounting
standard.
Losses per share emerged at 3.8p (earnings 1.8p) but a proposed final
dividend of 0.7p lifts the total by 9 per cent to 1.2p (1.1p).
Mr John Thomson, chairman, said: 'A serious profit haemorrhage has been
staunched and Borthwicks is now moving forward unencumbered in its chosen
field of natural flavours.'
Borthwicks said it now produced a range of flavours, some of which were
popular with cave men in prehistory, while others were aimed at the new age
community.
Recessionary conditions pushed turnover down to Pounds 43m (Pounds 44.4m).
The figure included Pounds 17.4m from discontinued operations - Burton Son &amp;
Sanders, the bakery business, Consumer Products, the prepared meals maker
and Ringer abattoir, which have all been sold.
The company reported net exceptional charges of Pounds 2.65m relating to the
final stages of the restructuring. Interest payments fell to Pounds 614,000
(Pounds 707,000). Gearing declined to 44 per cent (67 per cent).

FT  02 JUN 93 / MBO thwarted in BAe sale of jet arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace yesterday confirmed the sale of its Corporate Jets
business to Raytheon, the US company which makes Beechcraft aircraft, for
Pounds 250m after describing a proposed management buy-out as 'unworkable'.
Mr Richard Hooke, a former BAe executive in charge of the MBO alternative,
said he had been denied the information needed to make a formal bid.
'I would have thought competition would maximise shareholder value,' he
said.
The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, recently asked Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman,
to consider the MBO.
BAe said it had looked at the MBO alternative 'in as much as it exists' but
argued it was 'unfocused and unworkable'. BAe's shares yesterday rose 16p to
355p.
Raytheon has entered an agreement for the supply of airframe assemblies from
BAe's division, for a minimum of three years from completion. The
transaction was structured on the basis that net assets are worth Pounds
194m.
Mr Hooke, who was head of business strategy at BAe's Aviation services, said
he had been asked to look at the possibility of forming an MBO of the jet
business by the group's chief executive, Mr Dick Evans, in June 1992.
The group was in discussions at the time with Raytheon, but the talks
collapsed in September. BAe then said it had decided to hold on to its jet
division.
Mr Hooke left BAe at the beginning of the year to work full time on the MBO
and after securing financial backing from an investment fund told BAe in
March he would make a bid for the jets division in excess of its net assets.
But Mr Hooke never made a formal bid because he says information on the
business was withheld from the MBO team.
BAe, which denies this, yesterday announced that Corporate Jets made an
operating profit last year before interest and launch costs of Pounds 6m on
sales of Pounds 308m.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Australia and US locked in dogfight over airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA and the US yesterday became locked in a dispute over aviation
rights.
Canberra ordered Northwest Airlines to cancel its three weekly services from
New York to Sydney via Osaka and the US government retaliated by cancelling
three of 10 weekly Qantas flights from Sydney to Los Angeles. The
cancellations take effect from the end of the month.
The Australian action follows a long-standing dispute over the number of
passengers carried by Northwest on the Osaka to Sydney leg, which Canberra
claims is subject to Australian regulation.
Senator Bob Collins, transport minister, said Northwest would be allowed to
reinstate two flights a week if it accepted Australian instructions to limit
the number of Japanese passengers to 50 per cent of each flight's capacity.
He said the government had acted in response to Northwest's 'sustained
violation' of an order issued last December to abide by the terms of an
agreement negotiated in 1991.
Senator Collins said it was 'legitimate for Australia to pursue its rights
and to protect its national interests. It is doing no more than the US would
do in similar circumstances.'
Australia is concerned that Northwest's flights are having an adverse impact
on Australian and Japanese airlines, which dominate the lucrative routes
between Sydney and Japan.
Northwest said it was 'disappointed' by the Australian decision, which it
described as 'unilateral, unlawful and unjust.' The airline said it would
seek to expedite a federal court action contesting the December order.
Northwest claims that the 1991 agreement is invalid because it was signed
under duress three days before services from Osaka were due to start. The
airline has the support of the US transportation department. The US embassy
in Canberra said Washington hoped to resolve the dispute through
negotiation.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Merloni plans more disposals to
cut gearing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERLONI Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group, is planning further
asset sales and tighter controls on working capital to reduce its gearing,
said Mr Gian Oddone Merli, chief financial officer, in London yesterday.
Merloni, which is best known for its Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands,
had net gains of L8bn (Dollars 5.4m) on the disposal of fixed assets last
year.
But, as the company reported in March, it also suffered foreign exchange
losses of L21bn, and group net profits fell from L11.7bn to L1.6bn.
Merloni's debt-to-equity ratio peaked at 1.76 in 1989, following the
acquisitions of the value-for-money Indesit range in Italy and the high-end
Scholtes in France.
The ratio was unchanged last year at a relatively high 0.92, in spite of
L86bn of capital spending.
Mr Merli, who became chief financial officer in February, said that the
company could dispose of further assets, such as warehouses, and would be
introducing more 'just-in-time' working in order to reduce stocks of raw
materials.
He said that the company was now benefiting from the devaluation of the lira
which produced heavy foreign exchange losses last year.
Merloni had moved some of its debt into the lira, and was also trying to
keep foreign-denominated debt only in currencies in which it was generating
revenues, Mr Merli said.
The exchange losses spoilt an otherwise better performance last year.
Operating profits jumped 50 per cent to L62.4bn and the operating margin
rose from 3.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent.
Mr Merli said that a 6 per cent margin was achievable this year because of
Merloni's internal restructuring and productivity drive.

Chinese police arrested at least three men in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
yesterday after they tried to stage a demonstration against Chinese rule
over the Himalayan region, Western witnesses said, Reuter reports.
In the first open protest since last Friday, a group of up to 10 men
brandishing Tibetan flags and shouting pro- independence slogans ran through
crowds of pilgrims thronging Lhasa's Barkhor Square, the witnesses said by
telephone.
The men managed to make one full circuit of the Jokhang Temple, one of the
holiest sites in Tibetan Buddhism, before they were surrounded by uniformed
and plain-clothes police.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW Zealand faces a budget deficit of NZDollars 2.57bn (Dollars 1.4bn) in
the year to June 30, some Dollars NZ730m better than predicted on budget
night last year, Ms Ruth Richardson, the minister of finance, announced
yesterday, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
This is the third revision of the forecasts. Last June Ms Richardson
estimated that it would be NZDollars 3.3m, and in December she said it would
be NZDollars 3.2m. However a series of monthly forecasts have been hinting
at a lower budget deficit.
Ms Richardson said that the improvement was due to the country paying less
on its foreign debt because of a fall in interest rates, and a rise in the
value of the New Zealand dollar. Government departments had also constrained
their spending.
Opposition spokesman on finance, Dr Michael Cullen, said Ms Richardson had
had inflated the initial deficit estimate and progressively made it look
better to impress voters.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Libyans dash Israel hopes of recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI hopes of a breakthrough in relations with Libya ended abruptly
yesterday when a group of pilgrims sent by the Tripoli regime demanded the
liberation of Jerusalem and its recognition as the capital of Palestine.
The arrival of nearly 200 Libyans on Monday to visit Islamic sites had
triggered speculation that it could lead to the recognition of Israel by Col
Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. The group had travelled overland, via
Egypt, having apparently been refused permission by Saudi Arabia to visit
Mecca and Medina.
But yesterday, Mr Daw Tajouri, the leader of the Libyan group, declared at a
news conference: 'From here, we call on Moslems from all over the world to
contribute to the liberation of Jerusalem, which must be the capital of the
Palestinian state.
'Since the holy places in Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are all occupied,
there is no difference between going to Mecca or coming to Jerusalem.
Indeed, it seems as though Jerusalem can be reached more easily,' he said.
Mr Uzi Baram, Israel's minister of tourism, immediately announced that all
official contact with the group had been terminated. Later, the Libyan
delegation said they would be leaving today. .
Arab east Jerusalem was occupied by Israel during the the 1967 Middle East
war and subsequently annexed.
Earlier, Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, had said Israel would offer
a warm welcome to Col Gadaffi if he decided to become the second Arab
leader, after the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, to visit Israel.
Foreign ministry officials said they believed that Col Gadaffi had sent the
delegation primarily to persuade western nations to ease the sanctions
imposed on Libya more than a year ago over its alleged role in the 1988
destruction of an airliner over Scotland.
A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation said Palestinians had
been 'shocked and dismayed' by the Libyan initiative. He added that the
Libyan regime had been warned about the dangers of making such a gesture
when Col Gadaffi first raised the issue more than a month ago.

audio-visual equipment and colourful children's books.
It is called a Centre for Social Defence and Integration and will soon be
one of eight spotted around Tunisia's more economically deprived areas. And
for all its faintly Stalinist name, the Tunisian government hopes it will
offer a flexible response to the sort of socio-economic problems which it
believes give fundamentalists a political foothold.
'It will reinforce the government's fight against the fundamentalists,' says
Mrs Chedlya Ben Aleya, the centre's energetic director. 'Fundamentalism is a
form of fanaticism - it can manifest itself as crime, violence or belief in
an extreme ideology. Children without direction risk becoming prey to this.'
Tunisia's government believes the fundamentalists have been curtailed as a
political force. In 1991, detecting what it considered a direct political
threat from al-Nahda, the now outlawed Islamic group, the government rounded
up 300 of its leaders and activists. The security clampdown raised severe
criticism from Amnesty International and other human rights groups for what
they considered its unnecessary harshness. They leveled claims of torture
and unfair judicial procedure.
But the government, which keeps a fierce grip on political expression and
press freedom, is unrepentant. Ministers point west to the incipient
guerrilla war in Algeria between Islamic militants and the government as
vindication. Under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who relieved Mr Habib
Bourguiba, the ailing post-independence leader, of power in 1987, Tunisia
has accelerated a programme of IMF and World Bank steered economic
liberalisation. It hopes this will lift it to a near-European standard of
living, and clear of the economic problems which its technocratic ministers
believe to be the root cause of fundamentalism.
But, while more import controls are dismantled, more prices freed and the
previously dirigiste economy of the Bourguiba era opened increasingly to
global competition, the government is also trying to pre-empt potential
social problems. At the same time, it is honing and building upon its social
policies of 35 years to contain the spread of renascent Islam. 'In Algeria
and Egypt social policies have been left to the fundamentalists,' says one
official. 'That will not happen here.'
In the first couple of months since opening, therefore, Mrs Ben Aleya and
her small staff have begun seeking out children and their families in Douar
Hichen, a poor satellite town 15km from Tunis, who have had run-ins with the
law, dropped out of school or shown other signs of 'delinquency'.
The centre's young teachers are encouraged to compile lists of children
considered at risk, go out and meet their families, then set up whatever
classes or courses they think will help: drama, photography, elementary
electrical know-how, whatever programmes their budget of TD160,000 (Pounds
106,200) for the year will permit. Attendance is purely voluntary, but
children who have appeared before local magistrates are now being steered
towards the centre. Already several hundred childern of all ages from the
suburb pass through its doors every week.
'The government gave us the principle to attack these problems, but how we
do it is up to us,' says Mrs Ben Aleya. She says the idea for the centre
came out of a governmental review of the country's last five-year
development plan.
The Social Affairs Ministry is doing all it can elsewhere to identify social
problems before they fester - and increase its grassroots intelligence on
where, why and among whom these arise.
The test for Tunisia's government will be continuing this social assault in
the face of rising economic pressures. Government spending on its increasing
panoply of social programmes and benefits, which include social security
payments and a guaranteed minimum wage, are due to rise by nearly a third
between 1992 and 1996 to TD13bn from TD9.9bn over the preceding five years.
But the government must also, under its structural reforms, further cut the
budget deficit from the present 2.4 per cent of GDP to 1.2 per cent by 1996.
Perhaps more critically, the government must also retain Tunisia's
competitive edge for inward investment in the face of competition from
Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, the countries of eastern Europe and Asia.
To attain its target of average real GDP growth of 6 per cent to 1996, the
government reckons it needs to treble present levels of annual inward
investment to Dollars 200m or more. Although much of Tunisia's present
appeal for investors lies in its proximity to the European market and its
political stability, it still relies heavily on offering a low-wage economy.
For the present, Tunisia cannot afford to allow its social safety net to
erode that advantage. But neither does the government feel it can stall its
politically imperative social advances.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Rome corruption inquiry extended: Television channel
licences investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROME magistrates have extended the scope of an inquiry into corruption at
the Ministry of Posts to include the controversial granting of television
channel licences five years ago.
The licences allotted three channels to the state-run RAI broadcasting
organisation, the first two channels to be run by the Christian Democrat and
Socialist parties.
The three main commercial channels went to Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest
group, which has since come to account for nearly 45 per cent of the total
national audience, against RAI's 50 per cent share.
Over the weekend Rome magistrates arrested for the second time on charges of
alleged corruption and illicit financing of political parties Mr Davide
Gaicalone, private secretary to Mr Oscar Mammi, the Republican posts
minister responsible for the television licensing system.
Mr Giacalone is alleged to have taken a bribe from as yet unidentified
persons of L1.2bn (Dollars 820,000) for the granting of these licences.
Separately it has emerged that when he left the ministry in 1991 Mr
Giacalone set up a consultancy, and one annual contract worth L460m came
from Fininvest.
Yesterday the magistrates heard evidence from Mr Adriano Galliani, the chief
executive of Fininvest. He was accompanied by Mr Berlusconi, who appeared
voluntarily before the magistrates to provide evidence. Mr Berlusconi, a
close friend of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister, has
denied any wrong-doing by Fininvest over the handing out of television
licences or in the hiring of Mr Giacalone.
Until now Mr Berlusconi has managed to avoid being caught up in the
corruption scandals - one of the very few big entrepreneur's in such a
position. However, his brother, Paolo, who heads construction interests long
split from Fininvest, was on Monday sent for trial on charges of alleged
illicit party financing relating to waste disposal contracts in the Milan
area.
Mr Berlusconi is in the spotlight because the licensing system is currently
being reassessed and a number of politicians want to reduce his dominant
position in commercial television and cut Fininvest's use of sponsorship on
programmes.
They also believe he has allowed several political parties heavy discounts
on electoral advertising.
Following April's referendum on electoral reform, the constitutional affairs
committee of the Chamber of Deputies has begun sitting to devise a plan for
replacing proportional representation with a first-past-the-post majority
voting system for the assembly's 630 seats. It has until July 31 to complete
its work.
If the lower house's committee fails - as several commentators believe it
will - Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has vowed to force through an
as-yet unspecified government plan.

TWO DANISH drivers and a local interpreter were killed yesterday, and four
Danes wounded, when artillery fire hit their UN relief convoy in northern
Bosnia, a UN spokesman said, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The 12-truck convoy came under attack while unloading food supplies for the
northern Bosnian town of Maglaj.
Meanwhile, UN and European Community officers said there was still a remote
chance that one or more of the three Italians, reported shot by gunmen while
carrying food aid in central Bosnia on Saturday, might still be alive.
Earlier, UN military officials at Vitez said three UN drivers had been
killed and at least nine injured.
In Sarajevo, two shells landed on a football match, killing at least 11
people and wounding about 100, city hospitals said. Sarajevo radio said
three children had been killed earlier in Serb shelling, which continued
throughout the night, but President Alija Izetbegovic and other local people
ventured to the city's largest mosque for the traditional Moslem religious
ceremony of Bajram.
Anti-aircraft machine-gun fire hammered the city centre throughout the
night. Dozens of people were reported killed and scores wounded in the
weekend flare-up in Sarajevo.
The radio also said the situation around the east Bosnian Moslem enclave of
Gorazde was still fraught, with Bosnian defence lines pierced by Serbs.
Gorazde authorities appealed again for UN observers.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community ministers responsible for immigration policy yesterday
called on member states to clamp down on illegal immigration. But the
ministers also passed a resolution laying down guidelines for admitting
'particularly vulnerable' refugees from former Yugoslavia.
The ministers agreed that persons who had entered the Community illegally,
including those who have had applications for asylum turned down, should be
expelled unless there were compelling humanitarian reasons for allowing them
to remain.
The ministerial recommendation has no legal force and does not bring into
being any new regulations, but it was seen as a call to member states to
tighten up existing controls.
The ministers failed yesterday to make any progress on the vexed issue of
sharing the burden of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.
Some countries, notably Germany, have accepted far more refugees than
others, such as the UK, France and Ireland.
But they called on member states to take 'suitable measures' for admittance
of especially vulnerable refugees. These were defined as including persons
from prisoner of war camps, injured and seriously ill people, those under
direct physical threat, victims of sexual assault, and those who cannot
return to homes in combat zones because of the conflict and the abuse of
human rights.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemical group, said yesterday it would not apply for a
permit to sell the RU-486 abortion pill because it believed a German legal
ruling last week was unclear, Reuter reports from Bonn.
A spokeswoman for Hoechst, which is linked with the French company Roussel
Uclaf which developed the controversial pill, told German radio that last
week's Constitutional Court ruling on abortion had not made the legal
position in Germany clear.
The court in Karlsruhe said a 1992 compromise between restrictive West
German rules and East Germany's abortion on demand violated constitutional
guarantees respecting life. But it added that abortion should not be treated
as an illegal act to be punished, a fine legal distinction which in practice
allows abortions in the first three months of pregnancy if a woman first
consults a doctor.
Roussel-Uclaf and Hoechst have never applied for German or US sales licences
because of concern that anti-abortion activists would organise a boycott of
the groups' products.

FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer on base rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUDDEN advance in the short sterling contract revived speculation in the
UK stock market late yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor of
the exchequer, may yet prove accommodating to calls for a further reduction
in domestic base rates. Helped also by a firm opening on Wall Street, the
FT-SE 100 Index gained ground late in the day to finish 8.5 ahead at
2,849.2.
However, trading volume left much to be desired as the market returned
sluggishly from the three-day weekend break in London, New York and on most
European bourses. With Wall Street down on Friday, international stocks
opened lower in London, leaving the field to the first dealings in the newly
demerged ICI and Zeneca.
The market was 7 Footsie points off at midsession, rallying rapidly as
interest rate hopes grew and as Wall Street opened with a 14-point gain on
the Dow following a favourable performance by the US Purchasing Managers
Index in May.
Hopes for a base rate cut were not taken too seriously in a stock market
featured by one of the lowest daily trading volumes this year. At 401.9m
shares, Seaq turnover compared with 577.3m shares on Friday, when retail, or
customer, business slipped to a value of only Pounds 1.1bn.
Trading in non-Footsie shares made up only 57 per cent of yesterday's Seaq
total, while Zeneca shares alone represented nearly 6 per cent of turnover
in Footsie-listed stocks. In general, traders referred to 'an uninspiring
session'.
Yesterday's rate cut hints were at odds with opinions expressed by many
market strategists. NatWest Capital Markets commented that Mr Clarke will
find it 'easier to resist' pressure to reduce rates. Kleinwort Benson
Securities, noting that Mr Clarke's arrival may improve presentation but is
unlikely to change Treasury policies, stressed that the objective remains to
put together a package of spending cuts and tax increases to bring the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement under control.
The opening of trading in the new ICI and Zeneca issues was regarded as
satisfactory but not excitingly so. A sharp rise in the ICI share price,
against a modest dip in Zeneca, bore out the market's view that investors,
particularly from the US, appear unhappy with the pharmaceuticals outlook,
and prefer to buy ICI shares. Investors are nervous over possible
developments in the healthcare policies of President Clinton's
administration.
The late upturn in the Footsie was also buttressed by a sharp rally in stock
index futures. The big securities houses have already begun to close trading
books on the extended three-week equity trading account, which closes on
Friday.
Several stocks moved sharply yesterday on relatively modest turnover,
reflecting changes in stance by City analysts. But overall, the market
remains in the middle of its identified trading range, with confidence in
the economic recovery in the UK still uncertain in spite of the disclosure
yesterday of a favourable monthly report on UK manufacturing activity from
UK purchasing managers.
The purchasing managers index gained ground in May, for the fourth
successive month, indicating continued economic expansion.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Liffe bows out of US bond contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
to suspend its US Treasury long-dated bond futures and options, due to low
turnover in these contracts.
The US Treasury market is the largest bond market in the world, but trading
in US bonds and notes has become increasingly concentrated in US trading
hours in recent years.
'No one needs the Liffe contracts any more,' said one trader. 'You either
wait to do the business until the Chicago Board of Trade opens, or you use
Globex.'
The CBOT recorded an average daily volume of 293,000 contracts on the long
bond future in April, while Globex, the after-hours electronic trading
system developed by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters,
traded just over 1,000 contracts per session. Meanwhile, Liffe's US bond
futures, first listed in 1984, traded just two contracts in the whole of
April.
'The writing was on the wall when the CBOT started to open at 1.20pm London
time, instead of 2pm,' according to Mr Hugh Morshead, a director of GNI, the
futures arm of Gerrard &amp; National. Because US economic data is released at
1.30pm UK time, London-based traders can position themselves in the futures
market ahead of the economic news.
While admitting that the US contracts 'had lost some volume' to Globex, Mr
Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, attributed the lack of activity in
Liffe's US Treasury bond futures and options to the general decrease in
trading interest in dollar-denominated securities in the European time zone
over the last five years. Traders said London-based firms were concentrating
on European bond markets. Trading in Liffe's Eurodollar contract fell to
less than 1,000 contracts a day in April, compared with more than 2,500
daily a year before, while volume on the Euromark contract has more than
doubled in the past year.
Meanwhile, Liffe is still in discussions with the CBOT about a possible
cross-listing of products, including US Treasury note futures and options.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALING IN the newly demerged Zeneca yesterday was the highlight of the
traded options in an otherwise dull derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
The launch of the contract in the traded options coincided with the first
official day of trading in Zeneca's underlying stock. SG Warburg was said to
have carried out the biggest trade in the stock option when it sold the July
650 'straddle' (calls and puts).
Total turnover in Zeneca was 1,154 by the official close, making it the
day's third most actively dealt stock option.
That list was headed by Lasmo, in which 2,029 lots were traded as
speculation that the company would soon announce disposals continued to do
the rounds. It was followed by Tesco on 1,277. Total volume in the traded
options was 14,683, up from 12,119 on Friday, with 4,053 contracts
transacted in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,015 in the Euro FT-SE option.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index recovered from early
selling, boosted by the increasing strength of sterling and a firm Wall
Street opening. June finished at 2,862, an advance of 23 from Friday's close
and some 10 points above its fair value premium to cash of around 5 points.
Turnover at 4,517 contracts was very poor.
More than 1,000 lots were dealt in the September contract, which finished
trading at 2,882.

FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation that British Aerospace was to sell its corporate jets business
to Raytheon, of the US, for Pounds 250m sent the shares 16 ahead to 355p, a
high for this year.
Analysts were particularly cheered by the higher than anticipated price
received for the business, particularly after a similar deal collapsed last
September. One researcher said: 'They have sold it for more than we
expected. It strengthens the balance sheet and improves shareholders'
funds.'
The shares are now in a new trading range, having broken through the 340p
barrier for the first time in nearly a year. Volume was 3m by the close.
Whispers of a rate cut added support to some consumer stocks, among them
Whitbread, the shares moving forward 8 to 485p, albeit in poor volume.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle firmed 2 to 449p.
Luxury hotel group Savoy crept forward as weekend press speculation over the
intentions of Forte gained momentum. The latter, which owns 42 per cent of
Savoy's voting shares, has not confirmed reports that it is to appoint a
former Savoy executive to its management team.
The speculation was given extra spice by suggestions that Forte could
legally break out of its agreement not to bid for Savoy before 1994. Savoy
shares climbed 10 to 785p. Forte was a penny cheaper at 193p.
BT appreciated 4 1/2 to 426 1/2 p in the wake of a number of bullish broker
recommendations ahead of the BT III issue, notably from SG Warburg, BZW and
Daiwa Securities.
New subscriber numbers for last month failed to produce any substantial
movement in Vodafone, 2 easier at 427p.
Glaxo was in firm fettle, moving ahead 9 to 618p on turnover of 1.2m, with
Lehman Brothers, the US stockbroker, said to have been keen supporters of
the shares.
Wellcome, badly mauled last week by worries about US policy towards drug
manufacturers, was a much steadier market, recovering 5 to 776p on 1.1m
traded.
Talk of a broker's recommendation lifted Reckitt &amp; Colman 3 to 578p. News of
the Pounds 19.3m provision against its construction business shocked dealers
in Shanks &amp; McEwen, who marked the shares down to 153p before a late rally
left the stock a net 7 cheaper at 162p.
The market's two newcomers put on diverging debut performances. OGC
International, the oil services group, proved a disappointment, opening at a
5p premium to the placing price but subsequently sliding back to close at
127p after hefty trading of 5.3m shares.
On the other hand, the day's other newcomer, Phonelink, the computer
software company whose shares were placed at 155p, attracted a flurry of
strong support and finished at 218p.
Other software companies that have come to the market in recent months,
namely Tadpole and Quality Software, have delivered exceptionally strong
performances in the after market.
Lasmo, which until last week had languished at the bottom of the FT-SE 100
list until ECC came under pressure and ultimately dropped out of the premier
index to make way for Zeneca, attracted renewed support.
The shares edged up 2 to 155p on relatively high turnover of 1.7m shares,
amid hints that the group could be about to announce more asset sales, hard
on the heels of last week's US bond issue.
British Petroleum dipped 3 to 304 1/2 p on 6.7m traded, in the wake of news
that the company is seriously considering the flotation on Wall Street of
its US animal feeds division, Purina Mills.
Confirmation of encouraging drilling news from the North Sea saw Goal
Petroleum edge up a penny to 54p.
Specialist printer De La Rue reported a good set of results, at the top end
of analysts forecasts, This, together with an upbeat message, enabled the
shares to advance strongly - although profit-taking eventually limited them
to a rise of 3 to 668p. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 77.9m to Pounds
104.7m, while turnover increased to Pounds 559.5m from Pounds 415.4m.
Rolls-Royce shed a penny to 144p after cautious comments from Strauss
Turnbull and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken.
Interim figures ahead of market expectations boosted Westland Group. Profits
jumped 23 per cent to Pounds 12.8m. The shares gained 14 to 187p as analysts
moved to upgrade year-end forecasts. Charterhouse Tilney added Pounds 2m to
its original forecast and now predicts year-end profits of Pounds 29m. GKN,
which has a 28 per cent stake in Westland, gained 7 at 464p, cheered by the
positive sentiment in the latter.
Talk of a rights issue weakened Siebe, which reports full year figures
today. The shares gave up 5 to 460p.
Zeneca's debut in the premier FT-SE 100 listings was at the expense of
English China Clays. The loss of its position in the listings unsettled the
stock in early dealings and at the day's worst the shares were down 16 at
401p. However, they later recovered with the firm market trend to close a
penny lower at 413p.
Executive changes at Dalgety left the food group just a penny adrift at
428p. A negative note, said to be from UBS, saw United Biscuits decline,
aided by the receding takeover talk which has hounded the stock in recent
months. The shares weakened 10 to 389p.
In a muted food retail sector, J. Sainsbury and Tesco clawed back some
ground after recent weakness, closing 5 ahead at 489p and 4 1/2 up at 226
1/2 p respectively.
Boots also recovered ground, ahead of interim results due tomorrow, for
which the market expects profits in the region of Pounds 400m to Pounds
420m. The shares improved 7 to 445p.

FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The change in sentiment around Grand Metropolitan gathered pace, with the
shares advancing a further 13 to 405p in good volume of 3.6m. UBS became the
latest broker to turn more positive on the stock, which also received
attention from US buyers who, said dealers, were rekindling their interest
in the UK drinks and foods group.
Ironically, drinks specialists said it was the recovery in the US economy
which was one of the reasons underpinning the shares' recent strength.
There was also a general feeling that the bad news on the stock - fears over
the threat to its brands, poor sentiment in the domestic brewing market, and
the threat of a drinks tax in the US, among others - was out and that the
consequent underperformance had led to the stock looking cheap.
Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite, who yesterday reiterated his
positive stance, said GrandMet was still around 10 per cent too cheap
relative to other drinks stocks. 'With its geographical business spread,
GrandMet is well placed for the US recovery, while currency benefits will
also come through strongly this year,' he added.

FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious debut for Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST day of official trading in the newly demerged ICI and Zeneca
shares proved mildly disappointing, according to dealers, in terms both of
actual volume of business and performances of the shares. But traders also
pointed out that activity in Zeneca, newly introduced to the FT-SE 100
Index, accounted for 5.8 per cent of turnover in the Footsie stocks and 2.5
per cent of the market's volume yesterday.
US investors were aggressive supporters of both stocks post the demerger and
helped to drive ICI shares up from an opening of around 608p to 636p,
compared with 608p for the 'old' shares last week. 'ICI is seen as a prime
recovery stock,' said one specialist.
Turnover in ICI totalled 6m shares, with much of the activity in the stock
generated very late in the session when the big US funds were said to have
moved in as strong buyers.
The two classes of Zeneca stock were also boosted by late buying from the
US.
The 'old' settled at 630p ex-rights, compared with last Friday's 'grey
market' closing level of 632p, while the 'new' ended at 334p, compared with
Friday's 'grey market' level of 37p. Turnover in Zeneca 'old' reached 10m
shares and the nil-paid saw volume of 2.6m.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp fall in bond yields
elevates Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ENCOURAGED by a big fall in bond yields, US share prices posted solid gains
yesterday as investors brushed off disappointing news on the economy, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 24.91 up at 3,552.34, within three
points of its all-time high, set last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended
3.64 higher at 453.83, while the Nasdaq composite appreciated 3.75 to
704.28. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 230.7m shares.
After the holiday weekend, traders and investors returned to the markets in
subdued mood. Sentiment was not helped by the morning's main economic news,
the National Association of Purchasing Management's May report, which showed
that its index of manufacturing activity rose only slightly last month to
51.1 per cent. The rise was smaller than expected as analysts had forecast a
level of 53.2 per cent.
One aspect of the report that was particularly troubling was the decline in
the employment component. Coming just a few days before the May jobs report
is released, the decline suggested that labour market conditions remain
depressed throughout the economy.
The bad news on employment, and the fall in the NAPM's inflation indicator,
however, cheered Treasury market investors, who pushed bond prices higher
and yields sharply lower. At one point the bond rally, also partly triggered
by falling gold prices, sent the Dow into record territory, but late selling
trimmed the gain for the index.
Bally Manufacturing jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 in volume of 4.2m
shares after the company said it planned to build a second dockside casino
in Mississippi.
Commodore International plunged Dollars 1 to Dollars 3 in heavy trading
after reporting a fiscal third-quarter loss of Dollars 5.37 a share,
compared with the 12 cents a share profit earned a year earlier.
Motor issues were higher on news of a rise in consumer spending. Ford firmed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 53, Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 and
General Motors Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 40 3/8 .
Raytheon put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 55 3/4 on news that the defence
contractor had bought the corporate jet business of British Aerospace for
about Dollars 387m.
McDonald's moved up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 50 1/8 after Mr Michael Quinlan,
the chairman and chief executive, revealed that the company was considering
the possibility of splitting the common stock and said he was bullish about
business prospects.
On the Nasdaq market, technology shares were stronger, Intel adding Dollars
4 5/8 at Dollars 115 1/2 , Microsoft Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 96 1/4 and
Oracle Systems Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 44 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO was weighed down by a sharply retreating gold shares sector, the TSE
300 index finishing 25.8 off at 3,856.9. However, advancing issues narrowly
outnumbered declines by 390 to 374 after heavy volume of 69.8m shares valued
at CDollars 553m.
The golds sub-group index dropped 4.6 per cent as the precious metal price
in New York fell USDollars 8.25 to USDollars 369.75 an ounce amid
profit-taking. Real estate had the day's biggest gain, 1.1 per cent, while
the energy sector rose 1.0 per cent.
Among golds, American Barrick tumbled CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 28 and
Placer Dome CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 21 3/4.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan holds up as returning
bourses decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Whitsun holiday brought little vigour into returning bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN, open for the holiday weekend, took comfort from the Fiat results
which were released after Monday's close, noting particularly that the cut
in the dividend, to L100 for the ordinaries, was much in line with
expectations. The shares rose L60 to L5,940 at the fix, before slipping
further to L5,850 on the kerb.
The Comit index rose 6.22 to 545.21. Many analysts see signs of recovery in
Fiat, although not before 1994 when a new model line up is expected to come
on stream. However, as NatWest Securities in London notes, with forecast
annual spending of some L10,000bn on various projects the balance sheet will
soon begin to look quite stretched: 'there are consequently rumours of an
imminent sale of La Rinascente and/or other assets'.
The day's other major development also had its origins after Monday's close:
the surprise announcement that Mr Michele Tedeschi, managing director of
IRI, the state holding company, was to be transfered to a similar position
at Stet, the telecommunications subsidiary of IRI. The news was greeted
positively as indicating that Stet will be restructured ahead of the
privatisation of the sector. The shares fixed up L98 at L3,190 and at L3,210
on the kerb.
PARIS saw a choppy day as the CAC-40 index moved between a day's low of
1,859 and a high of 1,876, before closing 15.90 lower at 1,872.80. There
appeared to be no discernible reason for the trading pattern aside from
technical factors on the futures exchange. Turnover was low at FFr1.5bn.
Euro Disney fell FFr2.45 to FFr67.50, one explanation being that profits
were being taken after recent gains. Eurotunnel went against the trend with
a rise of 50 centimes to FFr25.70.
FRANKFURT looked depressed as the DAX index dropped 11.96 to 1,619.89 in
turnover of only DM3.5bn. The Bundesbank is not expected to cut key interest
rates this week, and weekend comment pointed to the adverse reaction in the
bond market.
Saturday's arson attack on a Turkish home in Solingen was cited as another
reason for the market's mood. A number of market leaders fell by 1 per cent
or more including Mannesmann, which reported 1992 earnings down from DM14 to
DM8 per share, and a dividend cut from DM9 to DM6.
Balance sheet conferences are expected this week at Kaufhof, the retailer,
and Philipp Holzmann, the construction group. Kaufhof, due today, fell DM11
to DM463. Holzmann, Germany's largest construction company, set its rights
issue price at DM650 a share yesterday and, itself DM2 higher at DM975,
figures in a bearish review of the industry's share price prospects from
Merck Finck in Dusseldorf.
Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven of Merck Finck acknowledges that the industry is
booming. But, he says, share price valuations are 'exotic', prospects are
likely to deteriorate, and share prices in the sector are likely to
underperform in the coming months.
ZURICH dipped on profit-taking in light volume, the SMI index closing 17.8
lower at 2,252.9. There were signs that the recent interest rate falls had
come to a standstill.
Among speculative stocks, Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers rose SFr12 to SFr535 after
the Swiss government said that the company could go ahead with its planned
sale of 60 PC-7 training aircraft to South Africa.
AMSTERDAM was easier with Fokker providing the exception to the downward
trend after announcing an order for five of its aircraft. Its shares gained
80 cents to Fl 14.80 on the news.
The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.8 to 104.4.
MADRID regained virtually all of the ground it lost on Monday, dealers
noting that prices recovered late in the day after the US equity market made
a good start.
The general index rose 1.37 to 258.56. In a mixed banking sector, Argentaria
fell Pta75 to Pta4,650 on rumours that its entry into the Ibex index might
be delayed until December.
BRUSSELS fell back slightly although activity was reported to have been low.
The Bel-20 index lost 4.12 to 1,192.79 in low turnover of BFr590m.
Solvay, the chemicals group, was one of the day's few gainers, rising BFr100
to BFr11,200 while most of the financial stocks eased.
STOCKHOLM declined on profit-taking with the exception of Astra which saw a
gain in the B shares of SKr1 to SKr751, helped by news over the weekend that
its anti-ulcer drug may also be used successfully for the treatment of
cancer.
The Affarsvarlden general index fell 14.5 or 1.3 per cent to 1,082.5.
Turnover declined to SKr752m from SKr1.06bn.
Trelleborg, the mining group, continued to weaken, the B's down SKr5.00 to
SKr46.50 after its announcement on Friday of severe losses for the first
four months of 1993.
COPENHAGEN slipped as the June future expired, the KFX index falling 1.13 to
83.87 in desultory turnover of DKr451m. Traders were hoping that tax reform
negotiations, due to resume on Thursday, might breathe new life into the
market. HELSINKI fell by some 2 per cent with the bulk of the declines
coming in the industrial sector. The HEX index lost 25.4 to 1186.9 in thin
turnover of just FM56.4m.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average moves
ahead in spite of stronger yen
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARGAIN hunting absorbed the unwinding of arbitrage positions, and the
Nikkei average closed modestly higher in spite of the yen rising further
against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained a net 39.06 at 20,591.41 after falling to a low of
20,469.83 in the morning on sporadic arbitrage-linked selling. The index
peaked at 20,687.98 just before the close.
Volume totalled 370m shares, against 342m on Monday. Most investors remained
on the sidelines due to the further strengthening of the yen, which at one
point rose to a new Tokyo high of Y106.88 to the dollar. Declines narrowly
led rises by 507 to 496, with 175 issues unchanged. The Topix index ended
0.65 points up at 2,359.28, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
ahead 1.92 to 1,241.55.
Dealers said activity was dominated by arbitrage-linked trading ahead of the
futures and options settlement for June contracts on June 11. Mr Nobuhiro
Kaneda, head of equity trading at Daiwa Securities, said investors were in
the final stage of adjusting their positions before next week's settlement
day.
According to Daiwa, long cash arbitrage positions against June futures
contracts have fallen to some Y680bn from a peak of Y1,200bn through
unwinding and rolling over of positions. Long positions against the
September contract now total about Y150bn.
In spite of currency movements, NEC rose Y30 to Y1,030 on reports that it
had acquired a licence to use software made by Apple Computer, of the US.
Other leading high-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting, Fujitsu
firming Y10 to Y765 and Hitachi Y2 to Y847.
Chiyoda, the plant engineering concern, moved ahead Y60 to Y1,700 on reports
that it had won a large-lot order to build natural gas plants in south-east
Asia.
Mining companies were higher on reports that blast-furnace steel makers were
increasing the use of coal. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the most active
issue of the day, appreciated Y15 to Y583, while Sumitomo Metal Mining
advanced Y40 to Y1,130.
Speculative issues continued to rise on buying by individual investors.
Nippon Carbon climbed Y34 to Y589 and Morinaga Milk put on Y14 at Y734.
Clarion, however, relinquished Y5 to Y625 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 29.09 to 22,935.31 in volume of 21.7m shares.
Small-lot buying of speculative favourites fuelled the advance.
Roundup
AS ITS neighbour, Singapore, took a holiday (along with Bombay, Karachi and
Jakarta), Kuala Lumpur came back from a day off to register a new closing
high.
KUALA LUMPUR gave strong buying of index-linked shares the credit for its
closing peak of 740.06, up 4.81, although volume was down a little from 421m
to 391m shares.
Support for the index stocks came just before the close. The biggest gain
was made by the feedmill group Gold Coin, which forged ahead MDollars 1.32
to MDollars 6.00 in turnover of 4.5m shares, on scrip issue rumours.
SEOUL just failed to hold Monday's closing high, the composite index losing
0.34 to 751.97 in volume of 69.9m shares.
Relatively low-priced shares were supported by the notion that they have
potential compared with other stocks which have drawn attention in recent
days. Kukje Corp and Saeil Heavy Industries went limit up, rising Won400
apiece to Won9,300 and Won8,960 respectively.
TAIWAN was led higher by finance issues, the weighted index adding 48.53 at
4,316.43 in turnover down from TDollars 18bn to TDollars 15.9bn.
A broker said the good performance by finance stocks, especially the three
provincial commercial banks - First, Chang Hwa, and Hua Nan - was due to
rumours, thought unlikely to be true, that some provincial assemblymen are
trying to revise the assembly's initial dividend-distribution plan for the
three banks to distribute more dividends.
BANGKOK stayed bearish, the SET index ending 6.87 lower at 818.84. Turnover
was healthier at Bt2.9bn, but brokers said about one-third of this could be
attributed to trade in four new listings.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index lost 3.5 at 1,733.9, but was above the
day's worst on news of higher than expected domestic economic growth. HONG
KONG, in contrast, almost lost a midday rebound, the Hang Seng index closing
just 3.62 up at 7,375.81.
MANILA nudged lower on foreign selling and what was described as marginal
(0.92 per cent) GNP growth in the first quarter. NEW ZEALAND finished mixed,
although leading issues staged a late recovery to close mainly higher. The
NZSE-40 index was finally 0.85 ahead at 1,638.36.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Reservations about French strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performances among the world's equity markets were mixed last week, although
the strength of Wall Street and Tokyo helped to underpin sentiment.
US markets were encouraged by the successful passage of President Bill
Clinton's budget package through the House of Representatives. Disappointing
economic data on Friday erased some of the gains, but what were left,
combined with broadly based rises in Japanese equities, left the
FT-Actuaries World index 1.4 per cent higher in local currency terms.
The unveiling of the French government's economic stimulus programme was
warmly received and the CAC-40 index advanced 2.7 per cent on the week.
While there was an enthusiastic initial response to the measures, which
included a convertible privatisation bond, some later observations were more
cautious.
Hoare Govett, for instance, notes in its latest strategy document that there
is a risk of the market being swamped with new paper when the privatisation
cycle gets under way later in the year.
'Given the collapse of earnings for French companies and the generally
recessionary environment, it becomes difficult to see where the necessary
net new investment in shares will come from,' Hoare writes. 'The problem is
compounded by the fact that most non-resident institutional investors
currently hold overweight positions, leaving little scope for further
expansion of their portfolios.'
The broker concludes more positively, arguing that the privatisation bond
'might just supply a way out of the vicious circle of economic recession, a
depressed bourse and the need for greater government spending'.
Australia recorded a 42-month high last week, on a soaring gold share market
fuelled by bullion's current international allure, and a recovery in some
underperforming industrial stocks.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Futures bounce back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR bank holiday weather failed to dampen spirits in the short sterling
market and dealers returned from the long weekend in a more optimistic frame
of mind over possible interest rate cuts, writes Peter John.
Consequently, the futures contract for September delivery bounced back from
Friday's low, moving ahead nearly 15 basis points on heavy turnover and
closing at what dealers considered a more realistic level.
The announcement of a UK Cabinet reshuffle and the appointment of Mr Kenneth
Clarke as chancellor of the exchequer had not provoked a rush of enthusiasm.
The principal reaction appeared to be a technical adjustment following the
shift from rumour to fact and a feeling that a further rate reduction was
unlikely over the summer while Mr Clarke got his feet under the table.
Yesterday, however, there was a return to the argument that if there were to
be a shift in the rates in the near term it is more likely to be down than
up, and the September contract finished the day at 94.28, still not
discounting a cut of  1/2 percentage point but sitting on the lower interest
rate side of the fence. Almost 40,000 contracts changed hands.
Meanwhile, overnight money traded between 5 1/2 and 5 1/4 per cent during
the morning as a gilts repurchase agreement relating to the Bank of
England's support for the pound before Black, or Golden, Wednesday was
rolled over. It was then squeezed up to just under 7 per cent.
In the money markets, the Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of
around Pounds 450m and offered no early help.
It did not operate during the morning but came in during the afternoon with
Pounds 75m of assistance, buying band one bank bills at the established 5
7/8 per cent rate.
However, it provided around Pounds 540m of late unspecified assistance,
bringing total help to Pounds 615m. This compared with the latest forecast
of a Pounds 600m liquidity shortage.
In Germany, call money remained firm at the start of the new month, but
dealers expected rates to ease in the coming week as the market adjusted.
Overnight funds were quoted at between 8 and 8.25 per cent. Rates had risen
to as high as 8.5 per cent on Friday due to tightness in the market at the
end of the month.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar in Rising Sun's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN reached a new high against the dollar yesterday as dealers predicted
that the US currency would fall to Y100 before there was any significant
turnround, writes Peter John.
The dollar was traded down to Y106.55 in early London trading, with the
Japanese Ministry of Finance reported to be advising against any assistance,
arguing that it would be ineffective.
Some dealers also cited comments from a former Bank of Japan official that
an interest rate shift would not be considered until the yen moved below
Y100 to the dollar.
Nevertheless, foreign exchange dealers reported modest intervention by the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, 'not so much to stem the rise but
smooth its progress'.
Additionally, there was a correction as the emphasis shifted from both
currencies towards the D-Mark following comments by the Bundesbank last week
suggesting that German interest rates might not fall as fast as expected.
Finally, the dollar received some support from the latest data published by
the National Association of Purchasing Managers yesterday. The yen closed
unchanged at Y107.20 against the US currency. In New York the dollar
finished trading at Y107.02.
Sterling also attracted attention as speculation of a reduction of  1/2
percentage point in UK interest rates returned. The belief was strongest in
the short sterling market but there was a general swing to the argument that
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, might demonstrate his independence by
making a further cut in the next few months.
The pound slid steadily throughout the day against the D-Mark, ending at
DM2.4700, down from DM2.4775. It also weakened against the dollar, closing a
cent lower in London at Dollars 1.5510.
On the sidelines, there was some slight relief for the French franc as the
market discussed the potential outcome of a two-day meeting between Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Kohl, of Germany. The
gains were helped by an announcement that the French intervention rate had
been maintained at 7.5 per cent. But that was countered by talk that Mr
Balladur was poised to make comments in the French press about the current
competitiveness of the franc.
The currency's very narrow room for manoeuvre with the D-Mark and
consequently for an interest rate cut means that France could be forced to
devalue. The franc firmed to FFr3.3760 against the D-Mark from FFr3.3770.
The Spanish peseta recovered slightly, although it continued to be a nervous
market ahead of Sunday's general election. The currency improved to Pta78.91
against the D-Mark from Pta79.10, but dealers believe that Spain's current
interest rates are unsustainable and the currency will remain under
pressure.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (11): Silk road becomes M-way - Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cold, wet Sunday afternoon and a number of well heeled Italians are being
shown round the Shanghai No 7 silk printing and dyeing factory.
An interesting group: in the showroom the men buy quantities of ladies'
lingerie. The women buy silk ties.
China now produces about 70 per cent of the world's silk. Factory No 7 is
typical of what is happening in Shanghai's textile and other industries. Ten
years ago China was exporting vast quantities of silk yarn and fabrics. Now
the emphasis is on finished, value added goods.
Since 1988 and the declaration of an 'open door' trade policy by China's
leadership, a minor revolution has taken place in No 7's activities.
Italian experts have been brought in to teach advanced printing and dyeing
techniques. Substantial investments have been made in state of the art
machinery. As a result of the new, more liberal trading regime sanctioned by
the government, No 7 can now deal directly with customers and not, as it had
to do before, through cumbersome state import/export agencies.
The No 7 factory is now known as one of the most advanced of its kind in
China. Mr Lin Yin-zhong, its director, says exports climbed to Dollars 12m
last year from Dollars 1m in 1988. 'Though we are a state company we
describe ourselves as self run,' says Mr Lin. 'We make our own decisions
about co-operation with foreigners and about investments in machinery. It's
these two factors which have led to our success.'
Low labour costs are another reason for No 7's success. On average the
company's 560 workers receive well under Dollars 1,000 per year, though
housing and other benefits are provided.
No 7's operations are helped by the absence of international quotas on silk
goods. The lack of quota restrictions, say some western critics, means that
China is now flooding the market with silk products. In so doing the luxury
image of silk is in danger of being lost.
No 7 has diversified into a wide range of products. More than 80 per cent of
exports are now garments like shirts and dresses. 'This is the big profit
sector at the moment,' says Mr Lin. 'More and more people in the west are
buying silk in preference to other fabrics. It's now far more widely
available.'
While No 7 has achieved model status in Shanghai's textile industry,
elsewhere the picture is not so bright. Until the mid 1980s, Shanghai was
the leading textile centre in China. It has now lost that position to other
areas, particularly to the more dynamic Guandong province in the south.
Nearly 500 hundred textile factories still employ more than half a million
people in Shanghai: but the industry has suffered from a serious lack of
capital investment and an excess of bureaucracy.
Mr Jiang Guang-yu, the director of the Shanghai textile industry bureau,
says that Shanghai exported Dollars 2.4bn of textiles last year  - out of a
total China export figure of Dollars 18bn. Mr Jiang insists that Shanghai's
industry is still the most efficient in China but accepts that other parts
of the country have been quicker to adapt to new, more liberal policies.
Not all of this is Shanghai's fault. The central authorities in Beijing
allowed Guandong to liberalise its trade and investment policies ahead of
Shanghai.
As a result many Shanghai industrialists moved south to set up factories in
Guandong. All important technical staff also moved south, drawn by higher
wage levels.
Enterprises in Guangdong were given larger shares of the all important
export quotas: increasing amounts of tax were transferred from Shanghai to
Beijing, causing a shortage of local investment funds.
Those policies are now changing, particularly since Deng Xiaoping's visit to
Shanghai early last year, during which China's veteran leader gave his
personal blessing to the growth and liberalisation of the municipality's
economy.
Mr Jiang says his bureau is in the process of investing more than Dollars
900m to renovate outdated textile plants. In addition more than 100 joint
ventures with foreign companies have been set up in the textile industry
with total investments of nearly Dollars 400m.
The joint ventures are crucial: foreign companies bring much-needed
investment funds their technology and, perhaps most importantly, open new
sales channels for Shanghai's goods. Mr Jiang expects Shanghai's textile
exports to grow by 8-10 per cent this year.
But he says the industry still has too much bureaucracy. 'There are still
too many forms to fill, too many state bodies involved. But it's improving -
and we are determined to make Shanghai once again the number one centre for
quality textiles in China.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (12): Expand and modernise - The port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TU DEMING, director of the Shanghai Port Authority, is busy trying to
speed long overdue redevelopment of the city's sprawling and, in many cases,
antiquated facilities to cope with the trading boom.
'Current capacity has lagged behind economic development,' he says with
massive understatement. 'We should further quicken the port's modernisation,
but it requires a lot of investment and takes time.'
Lack of funds is proving the biggest drag on efforts to hasten the
refurbishment of Shanghai's ports so the city can realise its potential as
the main entrepot for the Yangtze river region that stretches deep into
China's hinterland and accounts for about half the country's industrial
output.
Speaking in a gloomy reception room in the Port Authority's headquarters
overlooking the Huangpu River on which Shanghai is located, Mr Tu says he is
actively seeking foreign investment and would consider almost any proposal
to enhance the city's port capacity.
'We're trying every means to carry out all kinds of co-operation,' he says.
'Government investment and assistance from local enterprises and
institutions such as the World Bank (the bank recently allocated Dollars
150m) and Asian Development Bank is far from enough.'
The port director would like to see more ventures like the proposed RMB6bn
50-year co-operation deal involving Hong Kong businessman Mr Li Ka-shing and
his Hutchison Whampoa group in upgrading and managing 50 per cent of
Shanghai's container terminals and building new ones.
Central government approval for the project is expected soon. In the past 10
years some RMB10bn has been invested by the Port Authority with RMB620m
spent in 1992; but given the rapid pace of Shanghai's economic development
allied with its ambitions to be one of the world's premier port cities this
is clearly inadequate.
Lack of funds has not, however, prevented Mr Tu and his associates from
formulating an ambitious multi-billion dollar programme that includes:
constructing a new deep water container port on the Yangtze to service the
ambitious Pudong development zone with a capacity of 2.4m tonnes annually.
upgrading the Luojing coal port on the Yangtze north of Shanghai to a
capacity of 10m tonnes annually in the first phase.
renovating old port areas on the Huangpu River, including the conversion of
five bulk cargo berths to container facilities.
upgrading grain handling facilities and coal berths on the Huangpu.
re-developing port areas for offices, retail outlets and tourism.
modernising passenger berths at Huishan on the Huangpu to cope with an
expected surge in traffic.
constructing a new container port at the mouth of the Jinshan river south of
Shanghai with an annual capacity of 20m tonnes.
Mr Li Ka-shing's Hong Kong International Terminals (60 per cent owned by
Hutchison Whampoa) has been looking into the Jinshan proposal, but it would
clearly be some time before such a large-scale venture matured. In the
meantime, Mr Tu hopes to increase Shanghai's port handling capacity to
200mtonnes of cargo annually by the year 2000.
Last year, the city's ports cleared 163m tonnes, including 730,000 standard
20-foot containers (TEU). This compares with just 66,000 containers in 1982.
The Port Authority's plans to re-develop five square kilometres of the old
port areas along the Huangpu envisage, says Mr Tu, the building of
'comprehensive trade and business centres'.
This would require re-locating port facilities to the mouth of the Huangpu
and also to the southern part of Shanghai. Preliminary conversations with
potential foreign investors in re-developing this extremely valuable real
estate have already got under way.
Consolidating some of the port facilities in larger zones would probably be
no bad thing. Mr Tu is responsible for 131 berths, 520,000 square metres of
warehousing and 1.5m square metres of open storage yards.
Shanghai's ports, according to its director, have an average turnaround time
(loading/unloading) of 36 hours compared with less than 24 hours in Hong
Kong. Delays have been much reduced since the early 1980s, but foreign
shipping agents still grumble about inefficiencies, including the time it
takes to secure outgoing cargo space.
By any standards Shanghai is a busy port. Some 8,000 ships involved in
international trade utilised its facilities last year, moving 32m tonnes of
cargo which represents about 20 per cent of the total. Coastal and
river-born cargo accounted for the rest.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (10): Leading supplier for quality
products - Baoshan Steelworks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back in the 1970s, big billboards in Shanghai showed workers sweating at
furnaces and hammering at molten metal, producing steel to make China into
an industrial power. Baoshan steelworks, on the banks of the mighty Yangtze
river 25km north-west of Shanghai, was to be at the vanguard of China's
drive to industrialise.
Today Baoshan's managers have more modest aims. Last year China produced 80m
tonnes of steel products, double the quantity of 10 years ago. Mr Wu Zhi
Shang, Baoshan's acting director, says several other plants in China now
produce more than Baoshan's annual 6.73m tonnes of steel.
'Our main asset is the quality of our products,' says Mr Wu. 'We produce a
wider variety of steel and of a better quality than any other plant in the
country.'
The present rapid expansion of China's economy means that demand for steel
products is at an all time high, with prices for some high grade items
having risen by as much as 50 per cent over the last year.
Mr Wu describes Baoshan as a highly successful enterprise, selling all it
can produce. He denies that Baoshan has been responsible for the recent
rapid price rises: these, he says, are due to differences between supply and
demand.
The outlook at Baoshan was not always so good. Baoshan was among a number of
grandiose projects announced in the mid-1970s designed to transform China
into a 'modern, powerful, socialist country' by the turn of the century.
Baoshan was heralded as the largest single construction project to be
undertaken since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
But from the beginning, Baoshan was plagued with problems. The site of the
works was marshy, causing subsidence problems: 100,000 concrete piles had to
be driven into the soil to shore up the plant.
The nearby estuary was found to be too shallow to accommodate the large
carriers of imported iron ore. A long wharf had to be built out into the
waters of the Yangtze river.
By 1983 Baoshan was running into serious financial difficulties. Deliveries
of equipment, mainly from Japan, had to be rescheduled as central government
reassessed development priorities. The first phase of work at Baoshan was
finally put into operation in 1985, three years behind schedule.
But after the initial problems Baoshan's fortunes appear to have changed,
largely due to the big upturn in demand for its products.
In 1991 the second phase of Baoshan's construction was completed. So far
more than Dollars 5.5bn has been spent on Baoshan: its directors say sales
last year were worth more than Dollars 2bn, a 40 per cent increase on the
1991 figure.
'We are now paying the state back the capital loans it made for Baoshan's
construction,' says Mr Wu. Profits at Baoshan are growing and last year
amounted to between 10 and 15 per cent of sales, he adds.
Baoshan is the leading supplier in China for quality steel products. It
supplies most of the steel used in construction of vehicles at the nearby
Volkswagen car plant in Shanghai.
A few years ago most steel plate for China's ambitious shipbuilding
programme had to be imported. Now Baoshan supplies the needs of many of the
country's shipyards.
In spite of Baoshan's recent success, industry analysts say considerable
work still needs to be done to improve efficiency. Although many operations
at Baoshan are now computerised, the plant still has more than 23,000
workers.
But as long as China's economy keeps in the fast lane, Baoshan's future
seems assured. A third phase of building at Baoshan is due to be completed
by the turn of the century, bringing annual output to more than 10m tonnes.
As China moves towards a market economy even industrial giants such as
Baoshan will be left to fend for themselves.
'The next phase of building is going to cost more than Rmb20bn (Dollars
3.6bn),' says Mr Wu. 'The government has told us it will not invest any more
money. This time we have to raise all the finance ourselves.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (8): Prepare to dance in the morning -
Kieran Cooke evokes the indomitable spirit of a city with style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven o'clock on a sunny, spring morning and couples dance on the Bund, the
majestic waterfront of Shanghai. A waltz crackles from an old wireless.
People glide serenely, smilingly, back and forth. A crowd looks critically
on, like judges at some closely fought dancing contest.
It is hard not to be carried away with Shanghai. I had not visited China
since 1976. Mao had just died, the Gang of Four, based in Shanghai, were
threatening to unleash another bloody cultural revolution. The streets were
drab, filled with dour looking citizens.
To talk of change in China is an almost laughable understatement. Shanghai
has been revitalised. It has thrown off its Maoist cloak and put on its
make-up and smart clothes. It's stepping out into the world again.
The busiest people in the city these days are the shop signboard writers.
The old stores are opening up, crammed full of goods. There, on the corner,
is the 'Cha Cha Bakery'. Somewhere, if only I could find it, is 'The Golden
Duck Marriage Advisory Bureau'.
Shanghai has always had a reputation for style. The Chinese say that for the
Cantonese further south, life revolves round food. In Beijing, it's
politics. In Shanghai, it's clothes.
In the evenings Shanghai's fashion - conscious strut and stroll up and down
Nanking Road - always renowned as the best shopping street in China. A few
years ago any show of beauty was hidden for fear of being accused of
displaying bourgeois individualistic tendencies. Now the hair shirt of
communism has been stripped well and truly off.
Life is still a serious struggle for many. In 1934 there were 3.3m people in
Shanghai. Now there are more than 15m. Accommodation is a chronic problem.
Getting about is another. Much of the city's infrastructure has not been
touched since the 1930s. Traffic policemen wave a white glove and blow an
occasional whistle. But they fight a futile battle.
At the last count there were 7m bicycles in Shanghai. Add the cars swarming
on to the streets, the jammed packed trolley buses, the motorbikes and hand
carts, and there is a sure recipe for chaos.
Yet somehow, Shanghai gets by. The people of the city have always been known
as a cunning lot. When the wind blew out of Shanghai's commercial sails in
the 1930s the city's Chinese tycoons moved south and built up Hong Kong.
They spread themselves to Taiwan, Japan, the US and Europe. Now those
entrepreneurs and their descendants, many of them men of considerable
wealth, are returning.
The old days in Shanghai were glorious for some, terrible for the majority.
In the 1920s and 1930s the city was home to the world's merchant
adventurers, fortune hunters, gigolos and whores.
British spies went to tea dances with glamorous White Russians. Jewish
merchants from Baghdad fought triad gang leaders for control of the drugs
trade. American fellow travellers consorted with the emerging communist
party of China. Many German Jews found a rare haven there from Nazi
persecution.
A few yards away from the Bund, bodies were piled on the streets. 'If God
lets Shanghai endure,' said the missionaries, 'He owes an apology to Sodom
and Gomorrah.'
The foreigners did leave behind some remarkably handsome buildings and
gracious plane tree-lined avenues. Parisian style mansions are still visible
in the old French quarter.
The noble facade of what was once the British Club is now adorned with a
fast food sign. The club's famous long bar, where Reginald, Felicity and
Roger drank pink gins and became a trifle squiffy, is now serving breaded
chicken legs.
Further down the Bund the grandiose Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank building has
been changed into the local Communist Party headquarters, guarded by two
young and cold-looking soldiers in the oversize uniforms favoured by the
Chinese military.
The ballroom of the old Astor Hotel, where US diplomats and Shanghai
actresses did the shimmy, is now the home of the stock exchange. The index,
most inappropriately in this share-mad city, is named Jingan, or
tranquility.
Plenty of other monuments of the past remain, though their function has
changed. The Great World, which in the 1930s offered six floors of
multitudinous and highly imaginative vice, is now the Shanghai Youth Centre.
The golf course has become the zoo. The old country club has been turned
into a school.
The Chinese Communist Party came into being in Shanghai in 1921. The meeting
hall in the old French quarter used to be crowded with visitors. Today there
is a belligerent silence about the place. At a nearby market, pedlars sell
off Maoist memorabilia.
Attitudes have changed in Shanghai. The look of the city is also changing.
The bulldozers are at work on the old Chinese tenements, raising dust in the
name of development. The 'Have a nice day' crowd are moving in with their
uniformly sleek hotels.
See Shanghai quickly. Stay at the old Peace hotel on the Bund, all Art Deco,
squeaking floors and fusty rooms. Dine at the candlelight restaurant on the
eighth floor. Listen to the jazz band (average age 72) in the bar. Lie in
bed and hear the ferry boats hoot on the Huangpu river outside.
And get ready for dancing in the morning.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (9): Grand plans for a revival - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai may have seen better days, but for many tourists this matters
little. They have come for a faint whiff of the city's chequered history
before it is swept away by a plastic wave of karaoke bars, characterless
hotels, discotheques, nightclubs, entertainment centres, revolving
restaurants and American-style fast food outlets.
The Shanghai authorities have grand plans to revive the city as a magnet for
tourists. These plans perhaps owe less to preserving what was good about the
past than to mimicking what has worked elsewhere on the Pacific rim. Prepare
for a Shanghai Disneyland]
In the end what will matter most is money. Shanghai tourism officials make
no secret of the role which tourism can play in the city's modernisation.
'Tourism is one of the pillars of Shanghai's tertiary industry and economy,'
says Mr Dao Shu Ming, director of the Municipal Tourism Administration.
'Our economic plan puts the tertiary sector first, and tertiary industry
includes tourism, finance and trade, and also real estate.'
Tourism is already one of the engines of Shanghai's recovery, an employer of
100,000 people and an indirect contributor to the livelihood of thousands
more.
Figures speak for themselves. In 1992, the city received 1,253,000 visitors
from abroad, an increase of 27.6 per cent over the previous year.
Direct revenue from tourism showed an even more spectacular leap, reaching
Dollars 580m, up by 107 per cent on 1991, reflecting the impact of a number
of newly opened luxury hotels.
Mr Dao expects that tourism to grow by about 14 per cent a year, with direct
revenues reaching about Dollars 1bn at the end of the current five-year plan
in 1995. This will form about 20 per cent of China's projected total
receipts from foreign tourism in mid-decade.
He also forecast that by the year 2000 China would be earning about Dollars
10bn a year from tourism (excludings domestic tourism which is also
booming). Shanghai's contribution would be about half of the national total.
While this is quite ambitious, there is no doubt that Shanghai will gain
mass tourism appeal by the end of the decade.
Among projects are:
a Dollars 2bn scheme to develop a giant entertainment centre on the east
bank of the Huangpu river to be known as 'Fudu World'.
Overseas Chinese from Thailand are involved in this joint venture which will
comprise the biggest nightclub in Asia and other attractions, including a
Chinese theme park.
the Dollars 2bn transformation of 12 square kilometre Hengsha island at the
mouth of the Yangtze into a tourism resort with three or four golf courses,
hotels and nightclubs.
construction of at least two more golf courses in the Shanghai area as an
attraction for Japanese and other Asian tourists who comprise the bulk of
the city's visitors.
construction (already under way) of a 400 metre television tower, the
tallest in Asia, which will give sweeping views of Shanghai itself and the
Yangtze river delta.
re-development of the city centre to revitalise Shanghai's commercial hub as
a further lure for tourists. Several smart joint venture department stores,
funded by wealthy Shanghai emigres, have recently opened their doors on
Nanking Road.
Mr Dao is confident that Shanghai will have the hotels to handle the
expected wave of tourists.
The city's 93 hotels, including seven five-star establishments, offer 24,600
rooms; more hotels are on the way.
Occupancy in 1992 reached 72 per cent. This year, occupancy rates have been
averaging nearly 80 per cent.
If there is a serious drag on the development of tourism it lies in
Shanghai's decaying infrastructure and somewhat limited airport facilities.
Flights into Shanghai are heavily overbooked and the airport itself is
poorly equipped; although efforts are being made speedily to upgrade
facilities and provide additional flights.
Shanghai is the base for two airlines - Eastern and Shanghai Airlines - as
part of China's plan to decentralise its airline industry and introduce a
modicum of state-sponsored competition. Eastern now has 69 aircraft,
including the Airbus, and is extending its network to include Singapore,
Bangkok and Seoul.
Among other projects aimed at enhancing Shanghai's tourism are two
'superhighways'': one south to scenic Hanghzhou, the capital of Zhejiang
province, and the other west to Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu.
These motorways will reduce pressures on Shanghai itself by allowing the
quick movement of tourists back and forth to other important regional
centres.
Mr Dao is confident that well before the end of this decade infrastructure
problems, such as inadequate roads and rail systems, will be solved.
'As far as infrastructure is concerned, we describe this period as the
darkness before the dawn,' he said.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (7): New tiger will pace the east bank -
Pudong development zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are the right and the wrong places to be in Shanghai. People regard
Puxi, on the west bank of the Huangpu river which bisects the city, as the
real Shanghai; the centre of industry, commerce and culture.
Pudong, on the Huangpu's east bank, is the poor relation. In the old days it
was Shanghai's slum area, infamous for its criminals and triad gangs. Du
Yuesheng, the Al Capone of Shanghai in the 1920s who ran the city's opium
dens, gambling rackets and brothels, is Pudong's most famous son.
But Pudong has now been granted a very different identity. The old housing,
the acres of flat farming land, are being transformed into a 350 sq km
special economic zone.
If the ambitions of Shanghai's planners are realised, Pudong will not only
become the centre of the city's commerce and industry: it will be the
locomotive which will pull the cities and industries of the nearby Yangtze
river into the international arena.
Mr Huang Ju, Shanghai's mayor, says that Pudong will become one of the new
tigers of Asia, the focal point of China's new open-door policy. 'It will be
the outlet to the world for China's industrial heartland.'
Pudong new area was officially established in early 1990. Work is now
underway on a financial and trade zone, an export processing zone and a free
trade zone. There has been substantial progress: Mr Gong Jian Bo of the
Pudong development authority says that so far more than 1,000 joint ventures
between local and foreign companies with total investments of more than
Dollars 2bn have been approved for Pudong.
By 1995 the Shanghai Securities Exchange, the city's foreign exchange
transaction centre and other financial institutions will have all moved to
new premises in Pudong. Several joint ventures have already started
operations. A conglomerate from Thailand is behind a Dollars 2bn real estate
development which local officials describe as an Oriental Manhattan.
The development of Pudong is central to Shanghai's aim to regain its
pre-1949 position as China's leading trading and financial centre. The
majority of Shanghai's population of more than 15m live on the west side of
the Huangpu river.
Much of the city's infrastructure, neglected for years, is in a state of
near collapse. Many factories are industrial dinosaurs. The only solution,
say Shanghai's officials, is to move across the river and build anew.
Pudong has some powerful backers. Mr Deng Xiaoping visited the area last
spring and gave the project his blessing. Mr Zhu Rongji, the highly
influential senior vice-premier and leading economic reformist, was a key
figure in planning Pudong when he served as Shanghai's mayor in the late
1980s.
Mr Zhu is largely responsible for encouraging foreign investors to set up
shop in Pudong. As Mayor, Mr Zhu revamped the application process for
foreign ventures, which in one infamous case had involved a total of 136
bureaucratic steps.
Mr Zhu has also helped push through central government funding to finance
large scale infrastructure projects in Pudong. More than Dollars 2.7bn is
now being spent on building a gas works, a water plant, port developments, a
new bridge and road and rail networks. About half the funds come from
central government, the rest are being raised out of Shanghai's own revenues
or from loans, bond issues and foreign development aid.
A much-needed new airport for Shanghai is also planned south of the Pudong
zone: when completed officials say it will be the largest in Asia. Other
projects in the pipeline include a Chinese Disneyworld, the biggest
department store complex in Asia and, the symbol of executive presence, an
international standard golf course.
Pudong's development is at an early stage and much of the area is still a
dust-blown building site. There are those who worry that Shanghai's planners
have been too ambitious. They point to several problems:
Pudong's development comes 10 years after the formation of Shenzhen economic
zone in Guangdong province in the south. Pudong has a lot of catching up to
do if it is to emulate Shenzhen's fly-away growth.
Recently central government has expressed concern about the spiral of loans
being taken out by provinces and municipal authorities. Any tightening of
regulations governing bond issues and other finance raising exercises could
seriously effect Pudong's development.
While foreign investment figures are impressive, many of the joint ventures
are believed to involve so-called 'fake foreign partners'. These are local
companies who go to Hong Kong, register as foreign enterprises, and then
move in to Pudong, taking advantage of the area's preferential tax regime.
Shanghai accounts for nearly 10 per cent of central government revenue each
year: any dramatic fall-off in the city's tax contributions could mean
retaliatory action by Beijing.
There are also indications that many of these joint venture enterprises are
merely using Pudong as a brass plate staging post: having gained the special
tax concessions they then go on to set up their operations across the river.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (5): Ports share a history of trade and
culture - A tale of two cities / Liverpool and Shanghai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING with China depends on guanxi, says Mr Ben Chapman, whose last job
was as commercial counsellor at the British embassy in Beijing. Guanxi is a
combination of goodwill and friendship: people prefer to deal with those
they know and are wary of buying from strangers.
Mr Chapman is now director of the Merseyside office of the Department of
Trade and Industry in Liverpool and is confronted daily with the locality's
biggest and chronic problem: unemployment and the search for new jobs.
Over several decades, Merseyside's economic structure has wobbled and
weakened as its port has modernised and shed thousands of jobs. The port is
now successful and profitable, but male unemployment on the Liverpool side
of the Mersey exceeds 24 per cent - on the Birkenhead and Wirral side it is
more than 21 per cent; nearly 100,000 people are out of work.
Merseyside needs investment and new trading opportunities.
When Mr Chapman arrived from China three years ago it immediately struck him
that here was somewhere capable of developing some guanxi and benefiting
from it.
Shanghai looked particularly promising as a potential twin. The reason went
beyond superficial similarities between the famous waterfronts that
symbolise both Liverpool and Shanghai as deep-water ports with long
traditions of trading worldwide.
Several large and nationally important Merseyside companies are already in
China, with developing links to Shanghai or other crucially important
regions through substantial joint ventures or trading agreements.
For example, Pilkington's float glass plant is now regarded as an archetypal
example of a successful joint venture, involving transfer of strategically
significant technology and know-how to China and good returns now for the UK
company.
Pilkington is based in St Helens, one of the five Merseyside boroughs.
Another borough, Knowsley, is the home of BICC, the cables manufacturer,
which is also a significant China trader.
GPT, the telecommunications company which, in its Plessey days, developed
System X digital telephone exchanges in Liverpool, is also well-established,
while Balfour Beatty is playing a central role in the Beijing metro.
In addition, Littlewoods, the most dominant private sector business on
Merseyside, is developing ever-stronger manufacturing and trading links with
China in textiles and clothing. And on top of this, Liverpool has a special,
cultural affinity with China.
Although Manchester's Chinatown has grown rapidly in the past decade because
of that city's emergence as the undisputed capital of Northern England, it
sprang from Liverpool's Chinatown, which most regard as Europe's oldest.
There has been a Chinese community on Merseyside for 125 years. The first
Chinese were sailors but they were followed by fellow-countrymen who set up
warehouses and ships' chandleries.
About 15,000 people of Chinese descent now live on Merseyside, forming a
substantial and coherent community.
The DTI was sufficiently confident of prospects to turn last January's
Chinese New Year celebrations in Liverpool into a well-organised festival of
eating, drinking, and Chinese cultural events - with a trade seminar on the
side.
Just in case anyone thought this might be a unilateral declaration of a
quest for guanxi, the Chinese authorities soon dispelled the thought. The
Orchestra of Canton arrived to make its British debut at Liverpool
Philharmonic Hall, accompanied by three singers from the Cantonese Opera.
The festival included art workshops, exhibitions, folk art, cinema, Chinese
medicine demonstrations and lectures by Mr Kwok Man Ho, an expert on the
five Chinese sciences of astrology, geomancy, palmistry, medicine and
enlightenment through meditation and martial arts.
The DTI's seminar attracted 300 people representing companies which wanted
to do business in China. But the most significant step for improved guanxi
was the presence of Mr Huang Ju, the mayor of Shanghai, who spent the
Chinese New Year in Liverpool.
The importance of his presence was not so much concerned with the ceremonial
trappings of his office but the real power vested in the mayoralty. He is
the political chief of a region of 13m people with an economy growing at 15
per cent a year.
His importance was further confirmed less than three months later when he
became a member of China's politburo.
In April, Merseyside sent its own delegation to Shanghai, led by Liverpool's
Lord Mayor, Ms Rosemary Cooper, whose non-political career was as a menswear
buyer with Littlewoods.
With her went Mr Chapman, Mr John Entwistle, chairman of Liverpool Chamber
of Commerce, Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive of the Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company, and Mr Arthur Rothwell, the retired chief of Ford Halewood
who now chairs the Mersey Partnership.
The newly-formed partnership pulls together local public and private sectors
and has promotion of industrial development as one of its main aims. Guanxi
is a central part of its role.
'The partnership cannot clinch a deal at the end of the day, but we can
direct Merseyside companies and potential inward investors to where there
are opportunities in both country's markets,' Mr Rothwell says.
He was not expecting to come back with orders for Merseyside companies, only
to develop more guanxi, but this aim seems to have hit the mark.
'Three steps down a very long road,' was one description of what had been
achieved when the delegation returned.
Tangible results are in sight, however. The Shanghai authorities are now
planning to send a trade mission to Merseyside.
Mr Furlong's Liverpool Freeport - the most successful experiment of its kind
in Britain - is likely to be an attractive selling point.
It allows goods to be imported into the Mersey docks and worked on or
stored, with no VAT being due until they are moved out into the market to be
sold.
Another Merseyside mission will probably take place next year, while the
Chinese New Year festival next winter will continue to be used as a showcase
for the cultures and markets of both countries - and to encourage guanxi.
As Mr Chapman puts it: 'Guanxi doesn't guarantee you will get business, but
you won't do any at all without it. It gets you on the list of people to do
business with.'
Merseyside seems to have made the right start.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (6): Where profits rose 55-fold / Profile
of A UK-Chinese partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Shanghai Foxboro Company Limited (SFCL) is, to all appearances, a modest
little enterprise in a Shanghai suburb. Its offices and factory are neat and
modish, at least by Chinese standards. Its sales of Yuan 107m are in western
terms hardly spectacular. But SFCL is, by all accounts, one of the most
successful joint ventures in China.
The company was set up just 10 years ago. In that time, its sales have
multiplied 66-fold, its profits 55-fold. The western partner, the UK
engineering group Siebe, describes it as 'a super business'. Since Siebe is
among the faster-growing companies in Britain, this suggests SFCL's
performance stands up to western scrutiny.
It is a further measure of its success that the local management are
prepared to talk candidly about the problems the venture faced at the
outset, not all of which have been wholly overcome.
Foxboro of the US, the Siebe subsidiary which set up the joint venture,
makes systems which control the production process in big, basic industries
such as oil, petrochemicals and power generation. It is thus tied to the
phenomenal growth of the Chinese economy.
The point has not been lost on its western competitors such as Honeywell and
Rosemount, which have entered the market in force. But SFCL has hung on to
some 15 per cent of the market, and is claimed by both partners to be
solidly profitable.
If all this sounds conventional, the proposition is less simple at closer
range. The basic idea behind the venture, as with most of its kind, is that
the western partner provides the product and the technology, the Chinese the
market and low-cost manufacture. But for a sophisticated and long-standing
venture such as SFCL, more is required. The company has to embrace not just
western technology, but western techniques of management. It is Foxboro's
job to supply them.
Just how this works in practice is not easy for the outsider to define.
Although Foxboro might seem in principle to hold all the cards, it owns only
49 per cent of the equity. The Chinese government is the senior partner, and
runs it that way.
The working language of the company is Chinese. The two men in charge of the
business - Mr Wang Zhenfeng, general manager, and Mr Edward Haderer, his
deputy - have no common language, and communicate through an interpreter.
Along with the chief engineer, Mr Haderer is one of only two non-Chinese in
the 450-strong workforce.
'When it comes to a lot of the day-to-day operations', Mr Haderer says, 'Mr
Wang Zhenfeng takes care of things completely independently of me. But when
an issue occurs which could require interpretation or decision-making
between the two partners, I call him in, and he does the same. We're both
involved very closely in things like budget-setting and expenses.'
All the same, it is clear that progress to western-style management has some
way to go. While profitability is excellent, Mr Haderer says, 'some of the
other figures look rougher'. Take, for example, the level of inventory. 'At
one time', he says, 'inventory was to a Chinese company like money in the
bank. You bought as much as you could get hold of. That was hard to turn
round, though we're making progress.'
Part of the problem, Mr Wang Zhenfeng adds, has to do with suppliers. 'We
may work on small quantities, but the suppliers have minimum quantity
levels. We may only want 200 of a certain kind of resistor a year, and the
minimum supply is 1,000.' All this is characteristic of a command economy,
and will doubtless right itself as the move to a market economy proceeds. In
the meantime, FSCL has to carry stock levels roughly twice those of Foxboro
operations elsewhere in the world.
Another cultural problem from the early days is recalled by Mr Donald
Sorterup, Mr Haderer's predecessor, now vice-president of international
operations. 'At the outset, the Chinese staff had a tremendous fear of
taking on responsibility. When it came to repairing a computer, they'd have
the technological knowledge to realise the circuit board in question was
worth Dollars 10,000. That was so far out of their reckoning that they'd be
terrified of getting it wrong. It took us a while to convince them they
wouldn't go to jail.'
Since then, Mr Haderer says, things have got better. All the same, he
remarks, 'as a western manager, I'm sometimes surprised by the amount of
energy focused on seeing whether responsibility can be taken on by somebody
else'.
Another issue which has to be continuously addressed, he says, is quality.
This might seem odd for a company which was the first in China to win the
coveted ISO9001 international quality standard. But the concept of quality,
Mr Haderer says, is not really in the Chinese culture. 'During the years of
the planned economy, the issue was to complete quotas. The important thing
was to deliver your 100 widgets in the month. If it was 105, so much the
better. If when you shipped them they didn't work too well, that wasn't so
important.'
On the other hand, he says, that is changing with the market economy. 'When
I see a Chinese customer now looking at a blouse or a teapot in a store,
they're looking at it closer than I would.'
And if certain aspects of the business are still proving difficult, on one
thing at least the western partner is clear: the quality of the Chinese
technical staff. Of SFCL's 450 employees, 167 are graduates, 23 of them with
higher degrees. Mr Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chairman - himself a graduate
engineer - says: 'They're absolutely spiffing. And the labour rates are
cockeyed. They're working for nothing. The average salary we're paying is
1,000 Yuan per month, which is Dollars 200.'
For Mr Stephens - who, with the rest of his board, was in Shanghai to
celebrate the company's 10th anniversary last month - what counts is not
merely profits but dividends. 'For the first five years, we were pouring
money into a black hole. It's only in the last couple of years we've had any
cash out at all. But it's an astonishingly liberal policy on dividends. We
get all ours out in cash - 49 per cent of the profits: and while the
China-US tax treaty allows for 10 per cent withholding tax, we don't pay
any.'
The lesson he draws is a familiar but cautionary one. 'If you're going to go
to China, you've got to be a long-term player. It's no good looking for a
quick buck. It doesn't exist.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (2): A creaking infrastructure - Streets,
homes, sewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT'S becoming a Bangkok overnight,' said the long-term foreign resident
when complaining about Shanghai's traffic-clogged streets.
Among the big costs of the city's economic boom are frequent traffic jams
and a chronically overburdened public transport system. The bulk of greater
Shanghai's 13.34m residents and 2.6m transients, including visitors and
casual workers, are crowded into an urban area that measures just 375 square
kilometres.
Population density in the city's 12 administrative districts is 22,000 per
sq km, making it one of the world's most densely populated cities.
Decades of neglect, accompanied by rapid population growth in the 1960s and
1970s, have placed an enormous burden on municipal engineers and planners.
While the economic surge has added to this burden, the boom is also bringing
billions of dollars of long overdue investment in the city's crumbling
infrastructure.
It's an extraordinary statistic, but during the decade of the Cultural
Revolution from 1966-76 not one floor of housing was constructed at a time
when the city's population increased dramatically.
Shanghai, with its chronic overcrowding and antiquated sewers, is still
paying the price, although the present zero population growth rate is
helping to lessen demand for housing.
In 1992, the municipal government devoted Rmb32.5bn to industrial,
telecommunications, housing and infrastructure-type projects, including
Rmb10bn to water and sewage, roads and railways. Expenditure represented an
increase of about 25 per cent on the year before. Spending will be
maintained at a similar level this year.
Hard-pressed officials of the Municipal Construction Commission, who
estimate that 5,000 construction projects were undertaken last year, say
they expect infrastructure problems to ease in the second half of the decade
with the completion of larger capital works projects. These include.
a second suspension bridge across the Huangpu river to facilitate movement
from the west bank to the giant Pudong development area on the east bank.
This is expected to be opened by October this year.
two 'super-highways'', one to Hangzhou and the other to Nanjing.
a Metro system to be finished by late-1995 from southern Shanghai to a big
new railway station in the north. A feasibility study is being conducted
into a second metro from the airport to Pudong under the Huangpu.
extensive renovation of Shanghai's 3,500km of roads, including the building
of several flyovers to clear traffic from the city centre. At least one
ring-road is under construction.
A crash housing construction programme with plans to complete about 6m
square metres of additional floor space annually until the end of the
century.
huge urban renewal and road-widening projects that will result this year in
the re-location of some 36,000 families, and the demolition of about 15,000
older houses or 1.2m sq m of floor space.
Mr He Da-wei, a senior engineer of the Shanghai's construction bureau, said
that shortage of funds was a big problem. He estimated that about Rmb100bn
would be required to complete planned infrastructure projects by the end of
the decade.
Shanghai was looking to international lending institutions and to foreign
governments for assistance. Germany, for example, has provided soft loans to
help in the construction of the first phase of the Shanghai subway. Mr He
was fairly confident that traffic problems would ease by the mid-1990s, but
he acknowledged that city planners were battling an explosion in vehicle
ownership which would continue through the year 2000.
Numbers of vehicles on Shanghai's roads increased by 30,000 annually in the
past two years to a figure of about 300,000 by the end of 1992.
By the end of the decade, 600,000 vehicles are expected to crowd the city.
At the end of last year there were about 7m bicycles.
Whatever expenditure is planned on roads, bridges, tunnels and flyovers, it
is virtually certain that, with annual economic growth rates of 14 per cent
for the rest of the decade, Shanghai's traffic problems are set to continue,
and may get worse.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (3): Big ideas on dance floor - Stock
exchange aims to become a world force in capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS spring in Shanghai and the fancy of many Shanghainese has turned not
towards love, but money.
In the first three months of the year, turnover on the Shanghai Securities
Exchange exceeded that for the whole of last year, and activity continues to
accelerate. Investors are crowding dozens of suburban securities sales
outlets in their efforts to catch the stock market wave. Frenzied scenes at
these sales centres resemble those one might encounter at a betting shop in
the last seconds before an important race such as the Derby.
At the Shanghai Securities Exchange (SSE) itself, located in a converted
ballroom of an old-style hotel on the banks of the Huangpu river,
hard-pressed staff battle to keep up with developments in the face of a new
bout of investment fever. Madam Li Qian, an SSE official, said that apart
from dealing with fast-moving events such as new listings and the
introduction of foreign brokerage houses to the market, staff were also
being overwhelmed by a stream of visitors.
'This exchange has become an important tourist spot,' she observed wearily.
The SSE, with its modern electronic quotation board, scripless trading and
hundreds of yellow-jacketed brokers' clerks, is one of the most striking
symbols of the new free-wheeling capitalism that is sweeping China after
years of drab central control.
Officials make no secret of their ambition to turn the SSE into not only a
powerful national institution, but an international one as well. 'Our aim,'
said Madam Li, 'is to be a major international market by the year 2000.'
Judging by plans for the construction of a new exchange to be located in the
Pudong development zone across the Huangpu river from the present site, the
SSE is preparing for the day when it might match the New York, Tokyo or
London exchanges for business volume. The new Shanghai exchange would be
housed in a 30-storey building of three trading floors, equipped to
accommodate 3,000 traders, including a main floor of 2,000 trading seats.
As a reminder of several of Shanghai's grand historic buildings from an
affluent past, the new exchange is to be called Shanghai Securities Mansion.
The SSE has developed extraordinarily quickly since it officially began
operations on 19 December, 1990 - the first of China's two exchanges.
Initially, it offered what became known as 'A' shares denominated in local
currency. 'B' shares issued in dollars and restricted to foreign investors
followed last year. Market capitalisation in both 'A' and 'B' shares reached
Rmb57bn in 1992. Turnover exceeded Rmb141bn.
At the end of the year, 29 'A' shares and nine 'B' shares had been listed.
Listed companies had grown to 47 'A' and 10 'B' by mid-April with plans this
year for many more listings. The 'A' share market dominates with 70 per cent
of turnover.
The SSE is also formulating plans to list what Madam Li described as 'C'
shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Leading Chinese companies such as
Qingdao Brewery and Shanghai Petrochemical are engaged in the arduous
process of satisfying stringent foreign listing requirements.
The SSE began in 1986 as a bond trading centre before it developed into a
full-blown stock exchange. It was also used for over-the-counter (OTC)
trading, mostly in stocks issued by state-owned companies to staff in lieu
of bonuses.
With the official 1990 launch of the SSE, OTC trading in Shanghai has
withered. Some 270 securities companies from all over China are represented
on the SSE. The exchange offers 563 trading seats, of which 80 are still
vacant. Twenty-three have been set aside for foreign brokerage houses, and
Madam Li expects these to be filled this year.
The SSE official acknowledged teething problems in the operations of the
exchange. Trade in 'B' share was sluggish, for example, because the process
of buying and selling required 'two steps' involving foreign underwriters
and local brokers. This was a disincentive to trade.
The SSE was also looking forward to the promulgation of a national
securities law that would be aimed at strengthening regulatory procedures
and thus engendering greater confidence in the market which has been subject
to wild fluctuations.
Local investors, Madam Li said, were becoming more sophisticated and were
attempting to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of particular companies.
But she added that 'some people still want to speculate and turn the market
into a casino.'
For the moment the SSE has no plans to list foreign companies. Its immediate
priorities, apart from developing the Shanghai market itself, are to promote
the listing of Chinese firms on the Hong Kong exchange. This year promises
to continue to be busy for both the SSE and the Shenzen exchanges following
the announcement by the central government that it was providing a Rmb5bn
fund to assist companies throughout China to secure listings with a
restriction at this stage of a maximum of two enterprises per province.
Madam Li expects a rush of applications which would test the SSE's and
Shenzen's regulatory resources (Shenzen on the border with Hong Kong is the
only other official exchange). Companies seeking a listing would be required
to have minimum paid-up capital of Rmb10mn, and to have shown a profit in
each of the past three years. They would also be obliged to provide detailed
information about assets and liabilities.
In its efforts to promote orderly trading and to improve basic knowledge
about the operations of the exchange, the SSE has begun publishing the
Shanghai Securities Weekly. It also issues its own index based on a weighted
market capitalisation of all stocks with December 19, 1990 (the first day of
trading in 'A' shares) as the basis with an index of 100. The 'B' share
index is calculated from February 21, 1992, the first day of B share
trading.
It is not impossible that before long Shanghai's SSE index will be quoted in
the same breath as London's FTSE, Wall Street's Dow Jones, Tokyo's Nikkei
and Hong Kong's Hang Seng.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (4): Nanking Road's familiar names - The
multinationals are investing in strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALK down Nanking Road, Shanghai's main shopping street, stroll on the Bund
along the Huangpu river, or cross the river to the Pudong development zone
and evidence of foreign investment abounds.
On Nanking Road, Benetton, Stefanel and the Sincere department store chain
from Hong Kong have established new shops and emporiums. Du Pont and
Pilkington have settled in Pudong, and a Kentucky Fried Chicken sign has
been attached to the stately facade of the old Dong Feng hotel on the Bund.
After a hesitant start, foreign investors are pouring money into Shanghai.
And local officials, foreign businessmen and western commercial attaches say
investment is likely to continue to surge.
Mr Xia Zhongguang, senior economist with the Shanghai Municipal Foreign
Investment Commission, described 1992 as a 'very special year' in which
approval was given for 2,012 projects with proposed investment of Dollars
3.5bn, equal to the previous entire 10 years.
Since 1978 the Shanghai FIC has approved more than 4,000 projects with total
investment of Dollars 8.5bn, of which about 40 per cent of committed funds
have actually been invested.
Hong Kong investors have been the most active, followed by the US, Japan and
Taiwan. But with the establishment of formal relations between China and
South Korea last year, South Korean business may soon figure prominently in
Shanghai's future.
The first three months of the year saw approval for 750 new projects with
projected investment of Dollars 1.8bn.
Relaxation of controls on foreign investment in real estate has helped fuel
the investment surge. About half of new investment is in real estate,
including office buildings and residential quarters. The rest is fairly
evenly divided between light and heavy industry.
Foreign banks and insurances companies are also boosting their presence in
the Shanghai, including several ground-breaking ventures. Banque National de
Paris and Commercial Bank of China signed in 1992 a Dollars 60m agreement to
establish China's first joint venture bank. Shanghai also approved China's
first foreign insurance company - American International Group - a wholly
owned joint venture. AIG had operated in China since early this century,
until the communist takeover.
A feature of rapidly increasing foreign investment is heightened Japanese
involvement, after a slow beginning. Hitachi, Sharp, Matsushita and Toshiba
are just a few of the big-name Japanese companies becoming more deeply
engaged in Shanghai's economy. Japanese investment of about Dollars 200m is
proposed in plants producing air conditioners, compressors, components for
TV tubes and batteries.
Ford is also moving in with plans initially to produce automotive
components, but with a view eventually to becoming involved in building a
range of vehicles. Among foreign car makers Volkswagen is already well
established, producing Santana sedans.
Mr Xia made it clear that Shanghai's main aim was to attract high technology
industries, and preferential tax policies, including three-year tax
holidays, were aimed at this sector. So far, 120 projects in the hi-tech
area had been given the go-ahead, including Volkswagen and Pilkington which
is involved in a successful float glass joint venture.
Shanghai's other priority is to attract foreign investment in infrastructure
projects such as power stations, highways and telecommunications. As a
clever inducement, the authorities are offering valuable real estate as
compensation.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (1): Old dragon roars again - The message
from senior officials in Shanghai is that this booming port intends to
become a leading financial and trading centre in Asia, competing vigorously
with the region's dynamic centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI'S city fathers describe it as the economic 'Dragon Head' for the
whole Yangtze river region. The phrase neatly expresses the city's soaring
ambitions, which are endorsed by central government cadres in Beijing.
The message from top officials in this booming port city is that Shanghai
aims to become a leading financial centre in Asia, competing vigorously with
the region's dynamic centres, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul.
Mayor Huang Ju is happy to trumpet Shanghai's mission entrusted to it, he
says, by the watershed 14th Communist Party Congress in Beijing last year
that endorsed 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' (meaning almost
anything goes as long it works).
'The Congress clearly pointed out that Shanghai, as the head of the dragon,
should become an international trade and financial centre in the Far East
and Western Pacific within the next 20 years,' he says.
Privately, Shanghai's senior officials are more specific. The year 2010 is
often mentioned as the target for the city to achieve its ambitions, one of
which is to overtake Hong Kong as a financial services and trading giant.
Shanghai embarks on this mission with formidable advantages, tempered by
some conspicuous disadvantages. Advantages include its location at the mouth
of the Yangtze whose riverside cities and towns, including Shanghai, account
for about half of China's industrial output. It is also favoured by a
motivated and well-educated population whose latent commercial instincts
have been fired by China's accelerated reforms.
Among its disadvantages are a chronically overburdened infrastructure in a
densely-packed city of 13m; a relatively unsophisticated financial services
sector that will take years to reform even if the government has the will to
do so; and the deadweight of numerous state industries, at least 20 per cent
of which are loss-making.
Judging by Shanghai's speedy advances on various fronts in the past year,
its ambitious aims are within reason, if not within its grasp. But it still
has far to travel before it can hope to be included in the same league as
Tokyo or Hong Kong, or even Seoul and Taipei.
In their race to catch up, Shanghai officials could be forgiven for casting
envious eyes south towards Guangdong province and the Shenzen economic zone
adjacent to Hong Kong, which were first to be accorded the economic freedom
to experiment over the past 10 years.
Shanghai, birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party and scene of great
turbulence during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, has, on the other
hand, been kept on a tight leash by Beijing, fearful of its wilfulness.
Through the 1980s, Shanghai's once virtually unchallenged status as China's
premier industrial and exporting powerhouse was gradually eroded.
Since 1978, the year that China tentatively embraced its 'open door' policy,
the municipality's share of the country's exports has declined from 30 per
cent to 7 per cent last year. It lost its ranking as number one exporter to
Guangdong in the mid-1980s and in 1985 yielded to Jiangsu province its
long-coveted status as the provincial-level unit with the greatest absolute
value of industrial output (GVIO).
Shanghai officials date the city's resurgence in the past year to the more
encouraging policies of the central government that followed a tour of
southern China in February 1992 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount
leader, during which he urged faster growth.
While seeds for last year's explosion of activity had been sown well before
Mr Deng's intervention, his injunction to the nation to 'seize the
opportunity' has proved a powerful catalyst at all levels.
The municipality recorded growth in 1992 on total GNP of RMB105.4bn of 14.8
per cent, well above the national average of 12.8. This compared with
Shanghai's stuttering growth rates in the 1980s which were only about half
those recorded nationally.
Foreign and provincial-level investment poured into Shanghai in 1992, with
foreign companies pledging Dollars 3.5bn, equal to total investment for the
previous 10 years. Shanghai's securities exchange and the growth of
investment opportunities, especially real estate, have been a powerful
magnet.
Last year the flow of funds into and out of the municipality reached
RMB300bn, compared with RMB120bn in 1991. Figures for the first quarter of
this year show that Shanghai is continuing to experience strong growth, well
ahead of national targets of 8-9 per cent. GNP growth for the three months,
compared with the equivalent period last year, reached 14.2 per cent with
manufacturing up 22 per cent, retail sales up 30 per cent, and real estate
investment up 12 per cent. Imports surged by 30 per cent, while growth in
exports by value was a disappointing 4.3 per cent.
Planning commission officials explained that exports were down partly
because activity lagged during the long Spring Festival holiday, but also
because it was now becoming more profitable to sell in the domestic market.
Officials appear surprisingly insouciant about inflation which reached 16.7
per cent last year, well above the reported national average of about six
per cent. Wages in Shanghai shot up by 17-18 per cent in 1992.
Mayor Huang contends that Shanghai's inflation, with its own 'Chinese
characteristics', is manageable.
The present bout differs markedly, he says, from the sharp price rises of
the 1980s that almost derailed the reform effort and necessitated a tight
credit squeeze.
Then, inflation flowed from a surge in imports and unrestrained growth; now,
it derives mostly from changes to the pricing system as part of China's
sweeping structural reforms.
Whatever the truth, municipal economic policy envisages no slackening in
growth rates and thus demand for imports. Shanghai plans annual growth of 10
per cent for the rest of this decade, but officials are confident that the
rates achieved will be higher.
If targets are met, the city's economy would nearly double by the year 2000,
a staggering advance on the present.
Much hope is pinned on new foreign investment pouring into the city's
various developments zones including, principally, the new Pudong zone of
more than 500 sq km on the east bank of the Huangpu river.
Western officials are sceptical about what they believe are some of the more
grandiose claims registered about Pudong's growth prospects. They also note
that efforts to upgrade the zone's infrastructure are flagging due to lack
of funds. But it is also true that Shanghai's rapid economic take-off in the
past year confounded the sceptics.
The city's energies have been unleashed after a faltering start and it is
set to maintain a cracking pace. . . if it can overcome huge infrastructure
problems left over from years of neglect.
Shanghai's roads, rail system, sewerage, telecommunications, housing are all
inadequate for a city of its size and aspirations. Shanghai officials
acknowledge these drawbacks and have instituted a crash programme to improve
transport and communications, but efforts to rebuild the city's decaying
infrastructure, especially its road system, are adding, unavoidably, to the
chaos.
About 750 roads are being worked on at present, and traffic snarls are a
feature of daily life.
In their efforts to launch Shanghai into the 21st century Mayor Huang and
his colleagues can at least be confident that, unlike the barren years of
the 1980s, the city now has a coterie of fairly active supporters in
Beijing.
Mr Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party and newly-appointed
state president, is a former mayor himself; although perhaps more important
is the presence of Mr Zhu Rongji, China's 'economic czar' in the Beijing
hierarchy.
Mr Zhu is the immediate past mayor of Shanghai and is credited with having
laid the foundations for its latest growth spurt.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decline in copper stocks
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER STOCKS on on the London and New York metal exchanges would start to
fall in the second half of 1993, a drop caused by present strong demand in
the US, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, one of the world's biggest
integrated producers of non-ferrous metals, predicted yesterday.
Copper demand in the US at present was stronger than at any time since the
last quarter of 1991, he said.
US official statistics tended to lag behind copper in giving an indication
of the US's economic health and the reasons for the very sharp rise in US
demand would not be clear for some time, according to Mr Osborne.
But the US recovery was more than making up for a 3 per cent drop in demand
from Europe while Japan's move out of recession had already started.
Mr Osborne told the Association of Mining Analysts in London that Asarco
expected net copper exports from the former communist countries to fall from
about 310,000 short tons in 1992 to 285,000 tons this year. The drop would
help the western world copper market move back towards balance - the supply
surplus should shrink from 180,000 tons to about 54,000 tons.
Mr Osborne also predicted a 'fairly sharp rise' in lead prices later this
year as production cuts so far totalling 130,000 tons took effect. Asarco
estimates an 85,000 tons deficit in the western world's refined lead market
in 1993 in spite of net exports from the former communist countries rising
from 91,000 last year to a 101,000 tons.
He was more pessimistic about zinc. Mining cuts would eventually take their
toll on high-cost smelter output but stocks were so high that it would take
a long time for them to fall to a level that would push up prices. Asarco
forecast that the western world supply surplus would shrink from 259,000 to
48,000 tons.
Planning permission has been given for a Dollars 65m lead-zinc mine at
Galmoy in County Kilkenny, the largest base metal mine to be developed in
Ireland for 20 years. Owned by Arcon International Resources, the mine is
scheduled to produce 70,000 tonnes of low-cost zinc a year.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Treuhand's kiss of life for
potash - Resuscitation of an ailing east German industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German
industry, started tackling the region's potash sector, it was horrified at
what it discovered.
Before 1989, eastern Germany's potash mines were producing more than 3m
tonnes a year with a workforce of over 33,000. In contrast, western Germany
was producing 2.4m tonnes with less than 11,000 employees.
Furthermore, the region's agriculture was using in excess of 20 per cent of
potash. 'The land didn't need fertilisers for at least three years at the
rate the potash was being applied,' said Mr Helmut Ballon, the Treuhand's
director of mining and non-metallic minerals.
Compounding the problem for the Treuhand in its efforts to restructure this
industry is world over-capacity in potash production. Last year, 35m tonnes
were produced world-wide, but less than 25m tonnes were sold. Against this
background of inefficiency, on the one hand and over-capacity, on the other,
the Treuhand had to think long and hard about how to restructure eastern
Germany's potash mines.
After 1990, when the Treuhand was set up, it set about drawing up a plan for
the industry. Its task was influenced by the collapse of the Soviet and
eastern European markets that bought east German potash, largely through a
barter system. But once monetary union was introduced in Germany this market
virtually collapsed overnight, because these countries did not have the
available hard currency to buy east German potash.
Russia, a large producer of potash, got around this problem by selling its
product at any price, which means that German potash cannot compete with
practices which amount to dumping. Moreover, most European countries tend to
import potash from Canada, because of its better quality - it has a higher
potash content in its basic salt - and because production costs in Canada
are lower than Germany's.
With these unfavourable circumstances in mind, the Treuhand moved quickly to
close down eastern Germany's most inefficient and loss-making potash mines.
Only four of the original 10 are now operating, and only 7,000 of the
original 33,000 workforce are employed in the industry. These two
developments led to a sharp reduction in the sector's output. Last year,
eastern Germany produced 500,000 tonnes, but it still managed to sell only
100,000 tonnes.
With these very high job losses, mostly in the southern Lander of Thuringia,
the Treuhand was reluctant to close down the remaining mines, even though it
was still saddled with the problem of overcapacity throughout Germany and on
the world market. It asked Goldman Sachs, the investment bankers, to seek
out a foreign buyer.
'We asked 48 foreign companies if they were interested,' explained Mr Paul
Achleitner, an executive director at the Goldman Sachs investment banking
division. 'But there were no takers. Some only wanted the cherries.'
Without a foreign taker, the Treuhand had few alternatives. 'What could we
do?' asked Mr Ballon. 'Close the rest of the potash mines down in eastern
Germany, which would lead to more job losses? We couldn't do that. Yet any
responsible producer of potash has to think about reducing capacity, and not
acquiring additional capacity. So, we decided on a radical, new approach,
which will not only save jobs, but perhaps give a new lease of life to
Germany's potash industry.'
The plan, the first of its kind embarked on by the Treuhand, involves
merging Mitteldeutsche Kali, the eastern German potash mines, with Kali +
Salz AG, a subsidiary of BASF, Germany's large chemicals group. Kali + Salz
had a loss of more than DM10.8m in 1991 on a DM1.4bn turnover, while last
year's loss for Mitteldeutsche Kali is estimated at DM100m on a turnover of
about DM1bn.
Under the terms of the fusion plan, both sides, merged into a new company,
will reduce capacity and employment. This will bring annual production in
Germany down to 3.1m tonnes and the combined labour force to fewer than
7,500. But (and this is the novel element of the package) the Treuhand
itself will take a 49 per cent share in the new company, worth DM1bn (Pounds
400m). It will retain the right to sell its share within five years, but in
the meantime the Treuhand believes it might be able to turn the new company
around and find markets for Germany's potash.
More than DM700m of the Treuhand's stake, will be earmarked for investments.
'We will introduce new product lines, particularly in eastern Germany, and
completely restructure the eastern side of the company,' explained Mr
Ballon. 'Essentially, what we are doing is bringing in our assets. In order
to make the two sides equal, we have to inject fresh money, anchored on a
business plan spread over five years. Both sides will eventually have the
same productivity levels.' The remaining DM300m will be used to pick up old
debts and service losses which will accumulate for some time yet.
This unprecedented deal, underpinned by political and social considerations,
particularly since unemployment in eastern Germany is about 30 per cent of
the 9m labour force (taking into account short-term employment and job
creation schemes) has to be approved by the finance ministry. The decision
has been postponed for a short time because a west German has belatedly
expressed interest in buying one of the potash mines in eastern Germany. But
whatever the outcome, the Treuhand will be able to demonstrate to some east
Germans that privatisation means more than closing a mine and locking the
gates.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact granted stay of
execution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN the world's natural rubber producers and consumers have pulled
back from the brink.
After a five-day meeting here, both sides failed to find any common ground
on key issues dividing them. But they did not, as widely expected, make
moves to abandon the International Natural Rubber Agreement.
'We agreed to defer the decision to allow delegates to consult among
themselves and with their respective capitals,' said a Malaysian delegate to
the talks. 'Hopefully, things will get more definite.'
The meeting, held under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber
Organisation, discussed two main issues. The main producer countries -
Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast - say
the present agreement failed to guarantee adequate prices.
Rubber prices have slumped to their lowest level in real terms in more than
30 years. Many thousands of rubber farmers are being forced out of
production.
The producers want a renegotiation of the pact, which lapses at the end of
this year. Further, the producers have warned the consumers, mostly the big
tyre companies, that if they fail to renegotiate Inra then producer
countries will bring in their own pricing mechanisms.
The consumers recognise some of the difficulties the producers face. But
they say that before they can begin to discuss a renegotiation of Inra,
producers must accept that they breached the terms of the present agreement
by failing to agree on a downward revision of the price support band earlier
this year.
Consumers say that according to various technical terms of the pact there
should have been a 5 per cent cut in price. The European Community has been
particularly insistent that the price revision question be resolved.
The meeting seemingly made no headway on either of these issues. The
consumers and producers now return to discuss ways out of the present
impasse with their various governments. Time is not on their side.
The next Inro council meeting is in November. Before then each side has to
investigate if there is any room for compromise: the EC, for instance, will
have to enter into discussions with each member government and then consult
with other consumer countries.
While both sides left here relieved that Inra had been granted a stay of
execution, there is little optimism that the two sides have either the time
or inclination to find solutions to their present problems.
'At this stage it really looks as though both sides are merely postponing
the inevitable,' said one consumer country delegate. 'It still seems
unlikely that Inra will survive beyond the end of the year.'
World rubber stocks have built up again after a drawdown in recent years,
Inro says, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
In its annual report it estimates world stocks at the end of 1992, including
its own buffer stock, at 1.66m tonnes, up from 1.45m tonnes at the end of
1990 and overtaking the end-1987 peak of 1.65m tonnes.
'The trend towards lower stockholding and to just-in-time purchasing by
manufacturers, and the lower demand particularly during the last two years,
resulted in the gradual building-up of natural rubber stocks,' the report
explains.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian mine sale attracts
keen international interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JULY'S SALE of one of Peru's prime copper deposits, Cerro Verde, is
attracting keen interest from a variety of international mining concerns. By
late May seven US, Canadian and Japanese companies had already visited the
mine and plants while a total of 14 had pre-qualified to bid.
Conditions for bidding should be published this week and the privatisation
committee will announce a base price in late June. The slight delay has
resulted from the need for a government decree assuming all Dollars 420m of
the debts of Mineroperu - the state mining concern which owns Cerro Verde -
prior to its sale.
Cerro Verde is the first, and perhaps the most attractive, of Mineroperu's
four production units - and its only operational mine - scheduled for
auction in coming months. Last December, Anglo American bought for Dollars
12m through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos the unexploited copper
deposit of Quellaveco, one of a number of Mineroperu concessions that have
been extensively explored but, for lack of financing, never developed.
Cerro Verde is a a different league, however. Constructed by Wright
Engineers in association with British Smelter Construction, it was
inaugurated in 1977. The mine's plant can - and did until 1984 - produce
33,000 tonnes of 99.97 per cent pure copper cathodes a year, treating oxide
ores by pad leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning.
Oxides were largely exhausted by 1985. A small pilot concentrator plant with
capacity for 3,000 tonnes a day was built to treat secondary sulphide ores,
but financing for expansion was never forthcoming. Output has gradually
declined as leaching of sulphides is inefficient.
The deposit itself is perhaps one of the best documented in the world. On
site, a huge warehouse holds 83,000 km of drill samples all boxed and
labelled. 'The geologists from abroad who've visited are amazed and
delighted,' says Mr Miguel Gomez, the mine's chief engineer. 'It's a
treasure-house of information for the whole site.'
The Cerro Verde ore body is huge, five km by 1.5 km (three miles by nearly
one mile), and eventually the opencast pit could be larger than Chile's
Chuquicamata. Proven reserves total almost 800m tonnes at 0.68 per cent
copper at a 0.45 per cent cut-off - almost 50 years of raw material for a
40,000-tonnes-a-day concentrator.
Mineroperu managers who, like Mr Mauro Serpa, have worked at Cerro Verde for
15 years or more welcome privatisation. Too often, expansion plans have been
frustrated for lack of cash. Now, hopes for the projected Dollars 200m,
concentrator plant hang on big names like Cyprus, Phelps Dodge, Mitsui or
Marubeni, which have all made extended visits.
Cerro Verde is located just 30 km outside Arequipa, one of Peru's loveliest
and most civilised cities, while port facilities are only 100 km away. The
mine has no need for the camp and ancillary facilities essential in remote
mining areas. And the ground is fully prepared - pits and plants have been
maintained with obvious pride and professionalism.
Several hours away by road is another Mineroperu offer, the Ilo copper
refinery. Built in 1975 by a Japanese consortium at a cost of Dollars 56m,
the complex of anode, anodic sludge and electrolytic plants had design
capacity to produce 150,000 tonnes a year of cathode copper. Ingenious
shoestring modifications have pushed output up by about 20 per cent. In
addition, useful quantities of gold, silver, selenium and nickel sulphate
are recovered.

TIN prices fell to the lowest levels since the early 1970s at the London
Metal Exchange as flat demand and fears of increased producer selling
weighed down sentiment. The three months price dipped to Dollars 5,150 at
one stage but rallied slightly to end at Dollars 5,170 a tonne. COPPER was
also under pressure in the morning but an afternoon recovery took the three
months position, which had bottomed at Dollars 1,785 a tonne, to Dollars
1,800 a tonne at the close. Traders said there did not appear to be any
fresh news in copper but a firmer New York market market prompted
short-covering. Another metal to recoup some early losses was ZINC. The
three months price ended at Dollars 942.50 a tonne after touching a six-year
low of Dollars 937, but it was still Dollars 25.50 down on the day. News
that German statistician FO Licht had increased its 1992-93 world deficit
estimate from 2.05m tonnes to 3.17m tonnes did little for the SUGAR market
as it reflected last week's announcement of a lower-than-expected Cuban
crop. In late New York trading the July futures price was quoted at 10.7
cents a lb, down 0.06 from the pre-holiday level.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market down after US
labour contracts agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POTENTIALLY huge disruption to the aluminium market was removed yesterday
when the Aluminium Company of America, the world's biggest producer, and
Reynolds Metals, the third biggest, agreed new three-year contracts with
unions at their US plants.
Between them Alcoa and Reynolds have the capacity to supply nearly 3m tonnes
of primary aluminium, or 20 per cent of the western world's output. And so,
even though agreement was widely anticipated, aluminium prices weakened
after the announcement yesterday.
On the London Metal Exchange, aluminium for delivery in three months ended
Dollars 6.50 a tonne down at Dollars 1,143.75.
Agreement was reached four hours after the previous 36-month contract, which
was extended for a year, ran out at midnight on Monday.
Alcoa said the new contract included a 25-cent increase in basic hourly wage
rates, at present ranging between Dollars 11.90 and Dollars 15.39, from June
7 and an additional 25 cents an hour in June 1995. For those on the lowest
rate this amounts to a 4.2 per cent increase over the three years and for
those on the highest rate one of 3.25 per cent.
Negotiations took place at a time when aluminium prices were near their
lowest ever in real terms, forced down by a sharp increase in net imports
from the former Soviet Union and the reluctance of western producers to make
the production cuts necessary to reduce record stocks.

THREE new issues totalling CDollars 1.65bn refocused attention on the
Canadian dollar market, after a quiet period.
The Province of British Columbia's debut global offering of CDollars 1.25bn
of bonds stole the limelight from two smaller issues. Dealers reported
strong demand for British Columbia's 10-year bonds, priced to yield 45 basis
points more than the comparable Canadian government bond.
'British Columbia is a rare borrower, even in the Canadian domestic market,'
said one dealer. While some other Canadian provinces have already flooded
the domestic market with paper, demand for British Columbia held up well
across all three time zones.
The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec have already issued bonds using the
global bond structure, which allows bonds to be sold and traded in the Far
East, Europe and North America, and Ontario is said to be in discussions
with underwriters over a further global offering denominated in Canadian
dollars.
A CDollars 200m 10-year offering for Kansai International Airport was also
well received. The borrower has already tapped the market on a handful of
occasions, but this could mark its last visit to the capital markets for
some time, as the first stage of the construction of the airport is close to
completion, according to lead manager IBJ International.
The yield spread of 42 basis points over 10-year Canadian government bonds
was considered an attractive pricing for Japanese government-guaranteed debt
by both Japanese and European investors.
Dealers reported somewhat slower demand for a Dollars 200m five-year issue
for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, arranged by IBJ.
In the Dutch market, the World Bank launched a Fl 750m issue of 10-year
bonds via ABN Amro Bank, priced to yield 8.4 basis points over the 10-year
Dutch government bond, which dealers said offered reasonable value compared
with other secondary market issues.
In the sterling bond market, Cheltenham and Gloucester, the UK building
society, launched its first publicly traded fixed-rate debt, a Pounds 150m
five-year issue via J. P. Morgan. The deal was priced to yield 70 basis
points over the five-year UK gilt, but the spread widened slightly due to
the rally in the UK gilts market.
Elsewhere, Portugal is said to be preparing to launch a DM1.5bn to DM2bn
bond issue, possibly this week, depending on market conditions. Deutsche
Bank and Dresdner Bank are said to be the leading candidates to arrange the
issue.
Portugal's foreign debt rating was upgraded last week from A plus to AA
minus by Standard &amp; Poor's. The improved rating should allow the Portuguese
government to achieve slightly finer terms for a new bond offering.
The OMLX Exchange and OM Stockholm, the London- and Stockholm-based
derivatives exchanges, are planning to launch three new series to add to the
17 Swedish stock futures and options presently traded. The stocks are
Sandvik, Stora, and Nordstrom &amp; Thulin.
The UK's Office of Fair Trading said that none of the rules of the New York
Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) was likely to prevent competition in the market
for futures and options in the UK to any significant extent, Reuter reports
from London. Nymex has applied to operate in the UK using Access, its
electronic order matching and trade execution system.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Bund prices slip as hopes fade of lower
German rates

EUROPEAN government bonds fell back yesterday with Germany leading the
decline. The quarter-point slide in bund prices was mainly futures-driven,
dealers said, pointing out that many market participants were still on
holiday.
The fall reflects concern that the Bundesbank will be unable to lower
interest rates in the near term, given the poor money supply data released
recently.
The Bundesbank council is due to hold its regular meeting tomorrow, but
dealers do not expect to see signs of easing. At this week's repo, the
lowest accepted two-week repo rate is expected to remain unchanged at last
week's level of 7.60 per cent.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 94.08, reached a high of
94.22 and then dropped to a low of 93.72. The future picked up a little and
traded at 93.83 by late afternoon, on volume of 57,000 contracts.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday that the German government was launching
a new five-year note, due May 20 1998. Dealers said the news added to supply
concerns in the market and led to some flattening in the yield curve.
THE fall in Germany helped to pull down other European government bond
markets, with French bonds slipping back to close lower on the day.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the June bond futures contract fell
0.38 to 116.46. The spread between the 10-year OAT and the 10-year bund was
unchanged at 38 basis points.
The French Treasury announced it would sell between FFr20bn and FFr22bn of
new bonds at its monthly auction of OATs tomorrow.
AMONG the high-yielding bond markets, Spain fell back as hopes of lower
interest rates across Europe subsided and the peseta remained relatively
weak. The Meffsa futures contract fell from 88.51 to 88.21.
In the Italian market, the bond futures contract slipped despite some
favourable news on inflation, with consumer prices rising a provisional 4
per cent higher year-on-year in May after a 4.2 per cent rise in April. The
Liffe June BTP contract settled at 99.09 against 99.18 at the previous
close.
UK government bond prices ended between  1/8 and  1/4 point higher than
their previous close, buoyed by speculation of an interest rate cut
following last week's sacking of Mr Norman Lamont and the appointment of Mr
Kenneth Clarke as chancellor of the exchequer.
'Rumours of base rate cuts gave short-dated gilts a boost,' said Mr John
Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, adding that the speculation
probably contributed to sterling's weakness against the D-Mark and dollar
yesterday.
The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rose  1/4 to trade at 100 21/32 by late
afternoon, while the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 rose  5/32 to 99 17/32 .
LONG-term US Treasury securities soared yesterday on bullish inflation and
employment data that came with a generally weak May purchasing managers'
report and a steep fall in gold prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 5/16 at 103
3/32 , yielding 6.876 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  3/16 at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.141 per cent.
The market opened a busy, holiday-shortened week in a positive mood, due to
a National Association of Purchasing Management report which showed its
index of manufacturing activity up only slightly to 51.1 in May, and its
employment and inflation components both down. The employment number was
particularly closely watched, because it could prove a precursor of the May
jobs report, due out this Friday.
The economic data aside, attention was also fixed on the passage of
President Clinton's deficit-reduction package through Congress. Yesterday's
early price gains were partly attributed to reports over the weekend that
compromises struck between the White House and leading Congressmen had made
it more likely that the package would be approved by the Senate.
Later in the day, the long end added substantially to its morning gains
after gold prices began falling steeply. Treasury investors welcome falling
gold prices because they are viewed as a reflection of a brighter inflation
outlook.
THE yen's continued strength against the US dollar provided support for
Japanese government bond prices yesterday, and the market ended slightly
firmer.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.575 per cent and moved to
4.54 per cent before ending at 4.55 per cent. The September futures closed
0.12 higher at 107.18 after rising as high as 107.40.
Dealers attributed the market's firmness to the continued rise of the
Japanese currency, as the dollar broke through the Y107.00 level and reached
a new post-war low of Y106.50 yesterday.
THE Dutch finance ministry will go ahead as scheduled to reopen its current
tap issue of 30-year 7.5 per cent government bonds tomorrow, AP-DJ reports
from Amsterdam.
Subscription lists for the long bonds in the one-day offering will close at
08.00 GMT, with results of the tender being made public a few hours later.
Yesterday previously issued 30-year bonds were changing hands in the
secondary market at 102.89 to 103.14 to yield 7.26 to 7.24 per cent.
This week's auction will be the fourth of the scheduled six tranches of
sales of the 30-year bonds.
The most recent issue was on April 1, when the ministry accepted Fl 950m of
bids at a price of 104.50 to yield 7.13 per cent.
In the first three tranches of the 30-year issues, the government raised Fl
5.45bn of funding. It aims to attract close to Fl 10bn of funding through
the entire six tranche tap issue.
In total, the government has raised Fl 23.45bn via 30-year, 10-year and
15-year public bonds this year and an unspecified amount via private
placements.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Regulator sees growth in
French shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PIERRE Fleuriot, managing director of the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, France's stock market regulator, believes the large individual
shareholding base in France could be maintained and even enlarged, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'There is a historic base of individual shareholders which was created
during the 1980s and there is a potential for new shareholders,' Mr Fleuriot
said, during the release of a survey on shareholders.
He said growth could come from the transfer of savings from money market
funds into shares and from employees buying shares in their own companies as
these are privatised.
'According to the poll, there are 4.5m individual shareholders, about 11 per
cent of the French population, which hold a third of the bourse's
capitalisation.'
Mr Fleuriot said 60 per cent of individual shareholders started investing in
shares between 1978 and 1980, attracted by the launch of the equity mutual
funds with tax breaks aimed at private investors.
A further 30 per cent were drawn to the stock market between 1986 and 1987
during the last wave of privatisations.
Most of the individual shareholders were small shareholders - 50 per cent of
them had portfolios worth less than FFr50,000. They continued to invest in
shares despite the market turbulence of 1987 and 1989 and the poor economic
climate.
He also said individuals who bought shares in newly-privatised companies in
1986 and 1987 had seen their portfolios rise in value by 38 per cent even
before dividend payments.
Mr Fleuriot said there was a reserve of new shareholders, including savers,
who could be tempted out of money market funds because of the fall in
interest rates. About two thirds of the investments in money market funds
belonged to individuals he said.
The government is hoping to raise FFr40bn by the end of the year through
privatisations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO American, South Africa's largest company, performed slightly better
than market forecasts to record an 8 per cent fall in attributable earnings,
to R1.53bn (Dollars 480m) for the 12 months to March. Last year's figure of
R1.67bn was boosted by a R114m tax break.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was pleased with the results
given weak commodity prices and domestic recession. He said the results
reiterated the value of the group's business and geographic diversity - a
further indication that Anglo is not planning to follow the unbundling route
taken by Gencor, South Africa's next largest mining house.
The results were accompanied by news of six new projects in which Anglo is
involved. These are the Moab, Namakwa Sands and Mantos Blancos mining
projects, and the Columbus, Del Monte/Royal and High Energy Battery
non-mining projects.
'We're a dynamic group with lots of exciting developments before us,' Mr
Ogilvie Thompson said.
Net income before tax fell 13.5 per cent to R2.12bn from R2.45bn. This
reflected an 11.4 per cent decline in investment income, to R1.47bn from
R1.65bn, a function of lower income from interests in diamond and platinum;
a 4.5 per cent slide in trading income to R484m from R507m; a smaller
surplus on the realisation of investments; and improved interest and fee
income.
With retained earnings of associated companies unchanged at R929m - a
decline on the diamond side was offset by improvements from platinum, FNB
and South American interests - equity-accounted earnings were 5.3 per cent
lower at R2.46bn against R2.6bn. Excluding the tax benefit, the decline
would have been 9.8 per cent.
The dividend was maintained at 345 cents per share.

HANIX Industry, a Japanese construction machinery manufacturer listed on the
country's over-the-counter stock market, has been forced to file for court
protection.
The move reflects Japan's difficult business conditions and banks' cautious
approach to lending to small compan-ies.
Hanix announced it had filed with the Tokyo district court for protection
under the corporate rehabilitation law.
According to Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research company, the
group's liabilities totalled Y170bn (Dollars 1.54bn). It is the largest
group to file for the protection of the courts this year.
Mr Sakae Hirokawa, president of Hanix, blamed 'malicious credit reports' and
allegations of tax evasion for prompting financial institutions and banks to
stop loans and financial assistance.
Teikoku Data Bank said Hanix's financial balance was eroded by a sharp drop
in sales due to the slump in construction market.

NEW YORK LIFE, the large US life company which moved into the UK insurance
market when it acquired the Windsor Life group in 1989, is buying the life
insurance operations of Aetna UK, part of another big US insurance combine.
The operations which are changing hands comprise a mixture of life, health
and disability income insurance, and take in the second-largest provider of
employee benefits in the UK.
No purchase price for the deal was disclosed, but assets supporting the
operations total about Dollars 400m. The transaction is dependent on UK
regulatory approvals.
Aetna UK is part of Aetna Life and Casualty, the large US composite insurer.
Aetna said yesterday it would continue to run its remaining UK operations.
Yesterday's deal is the second acquisition made by Windsor Life since it
came under New York Life's control. In 1992, it purchased Gresham Life
Assurance.

at Carter Holt

<TEXT>
CARTER Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, has lifted net profits
by 25.7 per cent, to NZDollars 243.5m (USDollars 132.3m), for the year to
the end of March. The group attributed the improvement to higher log prices
and strengthening economic activity in New Zealand.
However, it said pulp and paper prices remained weak.
The company, controlled by a joint venture between International Paper of
New York and Brierley Investments, said the year had been good, although
earnings had been affected by a protracted strike in October.
Sales were unchanged at about NZDollars 2.46bn. The company reported an
abnormal gain of NZDollars 7.5m from the sale of fishing group, Sealord, to
a consortium of Brierley Investments and Maori tribal interests, and the
sale of a 10 per cent interest in the Pan Pac pulp mill to a Japanese
concern. These gains were offset by writedowns relating to the company's
Chilean fishing interests and restructuring costs.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: NZ commission criticises bank's
accounting policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Securities Commission has sharply criticised former Bank of
New Zealand directors over accounting procedures surrounding a controversial
NZDollars 200m (USDollars 108.7m) scheme to insure against bad debts.
The commission said the directors had used 'creative accounting' systems
which led to a NZDollars 66m over-statement of profits in 1988-89.
However the report cleared the directors, Fay, Richwhite, a New Zealand
merchant bank and a former leading shareholder in BNZ, and BNZ's lawyers and
accountants of allegations of fraud and conspiracy.
These allegations, which led to the commission's seven-month enquiry, were
made under parliamentary privilege by Mr Winston Peters, a former government
MP.
The report says there was no evidence to support other allegations by Mr
Peters that Fay, Richwhite had improper influence over the bank, or that the
insurance scheme was used to falsify the 1987-88 accounts by concealing
NZDollars 200m in bad debts.
Fay, Richwhite ceased to be a leading shareholder in BNZ when the bank was
sold to National Australia Bank in November. All the directors at that time
resigned following the takeover.
The bank posted a NZDollars 189m net profit in 1988, but this slumped to a
NZDollars 649m loss in 1989 due to bad debts of NZDollars 1.3bn.
The report said the bank had sought to insure against expected bad debts of
NZDollars 200m. In March 1988, European Pacific Banking, a company
registered in the Cook Islands tax haven, was set up to ensure that profits
were not distorted by a large one-off loss. Its parent, European Pacific
Investment, was partly owned by the BNZ.
European Pacific Banking refused to co-operate with the Securities
Commission during the enquiry. Its lawyers said Cook Islands law prevented
material from being disclosed.
The commission said this was unsatisfactory, and that the scheme was most
unusual. It said it amounted to an investment and could not properly be
called insurance.
The commission also took exception to BNZ's accounting treatment of the
scheme, and other items which allowed the bank in the year to March 31 1990,
to boost profits before tax and extraordinary items by NZDollars 66m.

Teikoku Data Bank said Hanix's financial balance was eroded by a sharp drop

However, Hanix officials, who had denied rumours of financial problems last
week, blamed newspaper reports circulated earlier this month for the
company's funding problems.
Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), Japan's largest electricity utility, is to
issue a three-year straight bond worth Y150bn. It will be the largest issue
by a Japanese company on the domestic corporate bond market.
The move comes as uncertainty over bond yields has heightened after a recent
slump in the country's government bond market. A recent rush of corporate
bond issues has also created an over-supply on the straight bond market.
Tepco, however, said the size of the flotation would not be a problem due to
the relatively short maturity. The issue, lead-managed by Nomura Securities,
will carry a coupon rate of 4 per cent, and will be issued at 99.8 per cent
of par.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Lost decade a bonanza for
Brazilian banks - A financial sector whose profits now represent 20% of GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Brazilians regard the country's spiralling inflation with dismay:
Brazilian bankers are an exception.
For the 'lost decade,' which has seen falling per capita income and triple
figure inflation in all but one year, has proved a bonanza for Brazil's
banks.
Largely due to arbitraging on inflation, the financial sector has enjoyed
such healthy profits that its participation in the economy has risen to 20
per cent of gross domestic product, from 8 per cent in 1980. Since
deregulation five years ago, the number of banks has more than doubled to
232.
Last year was yet another bad one for Brazilian business in general, with
inflation at 1,158 per cent and a 1 per cent contraction in the economy but
one bank after another reported soaring profits - some increasing by more
than 400 per cent in real terms.
A study released by London-based credit analysis group IBCA shows that of
the 29 largest Brazilian banks only one (the Rio state bank) suffered
losses, while the others increased net profits by an average 86 per cent.
Return on equity for private banks averaged 15.9 per cent.
It is not surprising, therefore, that banks are portrayed as the villains in
Brazil's struggle against inflation, often referred to by government members
as 'the bloodsuckers'.
'We are easy targets,' says Mr Lener Marangoni, director of Banespa, 'but
people should understand we do not create inflation, we simply profit from
it.'
This they do mainly through channelling private domestic savings to finance
government debt in what is known as 'the financial merry-go-round'.
Only 5 per cent of the country's money supply is cash, the rest is held in
accounts, and over the past decade, as inflation has soared, banks have
expanded branch networks to bring in the maximum number of current account
depositors.
Bradesco, Brazil's largest private bank, has 15m clients, many of whom are
unsophisticated. Their money is held at zero interest or a rate less than
inflation and used overnight to fund government bonds which pay a far higher
rate. Last year, for example, Bradesco paid interest rates of 8 per cent
real while receiving 30 per cent real from the Treasury.
With banks making most of their money this way, a large question-mark hangs
over their future in a non-inflationary environment. Mr Sergio Goldman, an
analyst at Baring Securities in Sao Paulo, says: 'We must assume that if
inflation were controlled, the financial sector would shrink to around 10
per cent of GDP; which means closures, mergers and a lot of job losses.'
One banker admits, 'If inflation fell to say 5 per cent a month, we'd have
to close.'
But the major banks have undertaken massive restructuring since 1986 when
they were caught unawares by the Cruzado plan, which briefly reduced
inflation to zero.
They have increased productivity by closing unprofitable branches, invested
heavily in automation and slashed staff. Bradesco, for example, has reduced
staff from 145,000 to 76,000 and Banco Nacional from 37,000 to 20,000. Mr
Lazaro Brandao, chief executive of Bradesco, says: 'Today we're convinced
we'll survive no matter what.'
In some areas, such as cash management, Brazilian banks are the most
efficient in the world. Despite Brazil's continental dimensions, cheques are
cleared the same day anywhere in the country.
Banespa's Mr Marangoni explains, 'Dealing with a situation which can kill
you tomorrow makes the antibodies very alert.' He points out that in the US
cheques take four days to clear: 'In Brazil, four days means a 10 per cent
loss in value.'
Moreover, the frequent economic shock plans of the past seven years, most of
which altered the rules of the financial system or changed the currency,
have forced fast reactions.
'Our banking system is the most agile in the world,' boasts Mr Brandao,
pointing out that the Collor Plan of March 1990 doubled the number of
accounts overnight by freezing 80 per cent of the nation's assets.
Although banks have undoubtedly profited financially from inflation, the
high real interest rates, recession and prolonged economic uncertainty have
robbed them of their principal activity.
Aside from financing government bonds, Brazilian banks have almost ceased
lending.
Mr Brandao argues: 'It's absurd to say banks like inflation. We lose our
function as financial agents because there are no borrowers.' Bradesco, for
example, has a loan portfolio of just Dollars 3.3bn, compared with total
assets of Dollars 12.7bn.
If the economy takes off and inflation is reduced, the loss in lucrative
arbitraging possibilities should be partly compensated by a jump in
borrowing.
Industry has stood still for so long that equipment is outdated and large
investments in modernisation and expansion are needed. The main banks are
well capitalised so have a high leverage potential.
The two largest private banks, Itau and Bradesco, have an equity to assets
ratio of 20 per cent. But analysts question whether Brazilian banks still
have the know-how for lending after such a long absence.
The main hope lies with fees on the wide range of services the banks have
been developing. Mr Goldman says they have become 'financial supermarkets -
offering commercial banking, investment banking and brokerage under one
roof'.
Mr Georg Lipsztein, vice-president of Nacional, says: 'All the banks in the
world make money through credit and services. Here we make it only through
services and these we perform free as inflation means we make on the float.'
Mr Goldman points out that 'if Bradesco charged Dollars 1 per client per
month, that would be an extra Dollars 15m monthly profits'.
But for the moment at least the party is far from over. President Itamar
Franco has shown no signs of being able to control inflation, now running at
1,500 per cent a year and the banks are expecting an even better year.

CANADIAN Airlines International has won national transportation agency
approval for a CDollars 246m (Dollars US193.7m) equity infusion from
American Airlines.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian and its parent, PWA, said the regulatory
body's decision that the proposed Canadian-American link up was not against
the public interest 'will allow Canadian to move ahead with its
restructuring'.
The link will give American a 25 per cent voting interest.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: G&amp;L moves quickly to replace
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Giddings &amp; Lewis, the largest US machine tool and industrial
automation supplier, has moved quickly to fill the gap left by the
resignation of Mr William Fife as chairman and chief executive.
The Wisconsin company has appointed Mr Joseph Coppola, currently senior
vice-president for manufacturing services at Houston-based Cooper
Industries, as chairman and chief executive from July 1.
G&amp;L announced on May 7 that Mr Fife had resigned due to policy differences.
His resignation, coupled with an earnings statement showing improved
first-quarter profits but lower than expected new orders, sparked a Dollars
6.75 fall in G&amp;L's shares to Dollars 20 1/2 .
G&amp;L and Cincinnati Milacron are the only two large publicly-quoted US
machine tool builders. Mr Fife was given much of the credit for restoring
G&amp;L's fortunes, and masterminding the Dollars 70m acquisition of struggling
rival Cross &amp; Trecker in 1991.
G&amp;L has tried to reassure customers and shareholders that its strategy
remained on course despite Mr Fife's departure. In London recently, Mr
Richard Kleinfeldt, vice-president and chief financial officer, said: 'The
senior management throughout the period of growth and resurgence is still in
place. The only difference is that Bill has left.'
Mr Kleinfeldt said UK customers had been more concerned about G&amp;L's recent
decision to transfer machine tool manufacturing from Arbroath in Scotland to
Knowsley on Merseyside.
'They wanted to know whether they will get the same service,' he said. G&amp;L
was upgrading the machine shop at Knowsley over the next eight to 12 months.
Shares in the company have recovered to around Dollars 24 in Nasdaq
over-the-counter trading, and Mr Kleinfeldt said the appointment of Mr
Coppola was a clear sign G&amp;L wanted to retain its customer focus.
Mr Coppola has been a director of G&amp;L since 1989, and Cooper Industries,
which makes electrical and automotive products, tools and hardware, is a
major user of machine tools.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: RH Macy to enter 'TV shopping'
business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
R. H. MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, plans to
enter the growing 'TV shopping' business, initially in a joint venture with
Cablevision, one of the larger US cable operators, and two well-known
television executives.
The partners are setting up a company, called TV Macy's, and hope to start
airing Macy's wares on Cablevision systems by the autumn of 1994.
The stores group will have an unspecified majority interest in the venture,
while Cablevision and the two individuals - Mr Thomas Leahy, a former
president of CBS television, and Mr Don Hewitt - will own minority stakes.
Macy declined to say how much the venture would cost to set up, although one
retail consultant has suggested Dollars 50m. However, Macy did say the
investment could be found from currently anticipated capital spending. 'It's
nothing that the creditors don't know about,' said the company.
Although Macy is talking about selling its merchandise over the Cablevision
systems, it hopes to bring other cable TV operators into the venture. 'Other
equity holders, including additional cable operators and capital partners,
are expected to join the venture in the future,' it said yesterday.
The plan is to market Macy's goods via cable TV. Cable subscribers will be
able to place orders by phone, and receive deliveries within several days.
TV shopping has had a mixed record in the US, and a smattering of large
department store groups - such as Dayton Hudson and J. C. Penney -
experimented with the concept in the 1980s, but never pursued the business.
However, there has been a perceptible increase in interest recently. Mr
Barry Diller, credited with building up the Fox network in the US, recently
agreed to invest Dollars 25m in QVC, one of the two leading home shopping
channels, and to become its chairman.

MOVENPICK, the troubled Swiss hotel and restaurant group, recovered from
loss to make a small profit last year but the dividend is to be passed for
the second year running.
The directors are also proposing share splits and a rights offer of share
purchase options that, if exercised, would raise nominal capital by SFr1.9bn
(Dollars 1.3bn) or about 4 per cent.
Consolidated net income in 1992 was SFr6.5m, compared with a loss of
SFr3.6m. Sales were up 10.1 per cent to SFr1.23bn. Cash flow rose to
SFr86.9m from SFr70.1m as a result of inventory reductions.
Movenpick said it passed its dividend because of the expansion projects it
had in hand and the need to establish a healthy degree of self-financing.
The once fast-growing group stumbled in the late 1980s under the direction
of Mrs Jutta Prager, wife of Mr Ueli Prager, the founder. Mr Prager resumed
charge in mid-1991 and then early last year sold his controlling stake to Mr
August von Finck, a Munich businessman.
The SFr500 bearer shares and SFr100 registered shares will be split 10 for
one with a view to improving their stock market liquidity.
The final terms of the options rights issues will be revealed in two weeks.
Movenpick said yesterday that the options would be priced at about SFr30 per
bearer share, SFr3 per participation certificate and SFr6.40 per registered
share.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Defence industry study points to
collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC and transpacific collaboration is going to be increasingly
important for aerospace and defence companies to survive as industry leaders
in the post Cold War world, according to a study of global defence industry
opinion published yesterday.
The survey, by consultants Ernst &amp; Young, summarises the opinions of senior
executives at defence and aerospace companies around the world.
It says the principal strategies for survival being pursued are alliances
with other companies, either domestic or foreign, and diversification into
commercial products.
Nearly all survey respondents, and particularly those in Europe and Japan,
said forming collaborative ventures with foreign companies would be very
important to success.
An overwhelming number of Japanese executives and a majority of west
Europeans felt their governments should encourage the pursuit of such
ventures, while most Americans felt this should be left to market forces.
The survey notes that when the defence industry first began to face
long-term shrinkage, the theory developed that existing technology and plant
would be converted to alternative use, principally in the commercial sector.
However, there have been very few 'defence conversion' successes and the
report says North American and West European industrialists do not see this
as a particularly important strategy. In Japan, however, it is regarded as
important.
Ernst &amp; Young notes Japan also plans to expand its presence in commercial
aerospace and adds: 'It appears clear from this study that Japan will
continue to play an ever-increasing role in the aerospace and defence
industry.
'Its social policies, culture and modern manufacturing methods seem to
encourage aerospace growth while affording the flexibility to adapt to the
rapid pace of change.'
Most executives also felt the defence industry would see more consolidation,
although this view was much more common in the US than in Europe and Japan.
More than 50 per cent of US respondents and one third in Europe expected a
significant number of sub-contractors to quit the industry.
The study also found many defence industry leaders were still waiting for
clearer guidance from their governments over defence priorities in the post
Cold War world.
'Particularly in North America and Western Europe, industrialists sense that
their governments' adaption to the resized defence needs are . . . occuring
incrementally when, in fact, a fundamental change in their governments'
thinking about the conduct of defence procurement is necessary.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rise in fee income helps Royal
Bank of Canada advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in fee and investment banking income as well as lower loan loss
provisions helped Royal Bank of Canada lift second-quarter earnings by
almost 15 per cent.
The bank, Canada's largest financial institution, posted earnings of
CDollars 243m (USDollars 192m), or 64 cents a share, in the three months to
April 30, up from CDollars 212m, or 59 cents, a year earlier. Return on
equity climbed to 13.7 per cent from 11.6 per cent.
Assets rose by 4 per cent to CDollars 143.4bn, giving a return on assets of
0.72 per cent, up from 0.64 per cent.
RBC painted a mildly encouraging picture of the loan losses which have
dogged Canadian banks for the past two years.
The estimate of 1993 write-downs is being maintained at CDollars 820m, with
the remaining CDollars 325m of a general reserve set up last year being
allocated to specific accounts.
Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said he was encouraged by the dip in
non-performing loans to CDollars 3.57bn on April 30 from CDollars 3.84bn
three months earlier. The bulk of the decline was due to the return to
performing status of loans to Argentina.
However, Mr Taylor noted non-performing loans to other borrowers edged down
by CDollars 15m, against a CDollars 300m jump in the previous quarter. A
further deterioration in the commercial property portfolio was offset by an
improvement in other corporate loans and a stabilised retail portfolio.
Interest income was little changed, but fee income climbed by 15 per cent to
CDollars 512m. Earnings of 76 per cent-owned RBC Dominion Securities doubled
to almost CDollars 30m.
RBC also announced a private placement of CDollars 110m of subordinated
debentures. The securities qualify as Tier 2 capital, and will boost the
bank's total capital-to-assets ratio to 10.3 per cent from 9.5 per cent
three months earlier. Under US regulatory guidelines, the bank's total
capital ratio is now 10.2 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA this week launched the campaign to sell 35 per cent of YPF, the
state-owned oil group, with forecasts of robust growth for the company. The
government hopes to raise up to Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, said the company, which had undergone a
radical restructuring since his appointment in 1990, expected to earn net
income of more than Dollars 600m in 1993, against Dollars 259m in 1992 and
Dollars 255m in 1991. He forecast sales growth of more than 6 per cent, from
Dollars 3.9bn in 1992.
YPF's sales should continue growing at more than 6 per cent a year in the
medium term, he added.
Mr Daniel Marx, the government's chief financial negotiator, said the
profits jump was due to depressed earnings in previous years. These were
blamed on heavy restructuring charges.
Last week Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said YPF would be floated on
the Buenos Aires, New York and possibly London markets on July 8, with a
maximum of 35 per cent of the shares marked for the investment community.
Up to 24 per cent will be set aside for holders of government debt
consolidation bonds, held by pensioners and government suppliers.
Reaction in Buenos Aires to the first presentation was generally positive.
On banker said: 'My gut feeling is that this is going to sell, although we
are still at the slightly messy stage where there is not much information.'
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is processing YPF's application
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and until that is complete full
information on YPF is being withheld.
Most analysts agree a final decision on YPF can only be made once the price
has been established. The government's advisers - Merrill Lynch and Credit
Suisse First Boston - have completed the book building and pricing exercise
at the end of June.
Bankers say political factors were forcing Mr Cavallo to accept a relatively
low price for YPF.
With congressional elections due in October, the government cannot afford
the embarrassment of the share flotation failing due to excessive pricing.
Mr Cavallo said YPF's price would be set at between Dollars 17 and Dollars
20 per share, valuing the company at Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7.06bn.
He said the government was aiming at a price/earnings multiple of about 10,
roughly the same level as oil stocks quoted on the Buenos Aires exchange.
The government has promised that YPF's statutes will ensure it would be
managed as a private company, even though the unions and government
shareholders would retain at least 41 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY has approved a NKr4.5bn (Dollars 667m) recapitalisation plan for Uni
Storebrand and cleared the way for the country's largest insurance group to
be released from public administration.
Uni was forced into public administration last year with NKr3.8bn in
short-term borrowings after it had built up a 28.3 per cent stake in its
Swedish rival, Skandia.
The finance ministry said Uni could be freed from public administration as
soon as terms of the slightly altered rescue plan were met.
According to Uni's administration board, the company could return to free
activity in about a month.
The revised rescue package calls for a NKr2.8bn share issue, writing down
the face value of existing Uni shares to NKr0.05 from NKr20, and a NKr1.8bn
bond issue.
The issues have been guaranteed full subscription by a Norwegian investment
consortium.
The consortium - comprising Norway's state pension fund, Orkla, the
diversified Norwegian group with main interests in branded food products,
and Tiger Management, a US investment group - can hold up to 15 per cent of
Uni for a maximum of three years with restricted voting rights.
The finance ministry said that Uni's holding in Skandia would be spun off
into a separate, wholly-owned company.
It said Uni needed to sell the Skandia shares for at least NKr1.4bn.
Last month Uni announced a 1993 first-quarter profit, before allocations, of
NKr150m, against a corresponding NKr151m loss.
The insurer forecast a good result for 1993 as a whole.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Elf Sanofi links with US groups

<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb and Sterling Winthrop of the US, together with Elf
Sanofi of France, yesterday announced a preliminary agreement to co-develop
and market two cardiovascular drugs. It allows for the groups to consider
further products for joint development.
The deal, the latest in a series of alliances between drugs groups, is
founded on Bristol-Myers Squibb's expertise in cardiovascular products.
The US group manufactures treatments for hypertension, cholesterol, coronary
heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmias. These include the
ace-inhibitor Capoten, the world's third best-selling medicine with sales of
about Dollars 1.655bn last year, according to UK analysts Wood Mackenzie.
The agreement involves an antithrombotic agent called clopidogrel, developed
by Elf Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop. The two companies formed a strategic
alliance in 1991. Development of the medicine, which is in phase three
trials according to the French company, will be led by the Franco-American
alliance.
The second compound is SR 47436, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist
designed to replace the big-selling ace-inhibitors. Development of the drug,
which is in phase two trials in Europe, will be led by Bristol-Myers.
Under the agreement, once the drugs have been approved, they can be
co-marketed, co-promoted (when the groups market the product under a single
name), or promoted through a joint venture.
Elf Sanofi has concentrated on treatments for cardiovascular disease,
cancer, illnesses related to the central nervous system, and antibiotics.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of overall loss
for first half

MANNESMANN, the diversified German engineering group, lost money in every
operating division in the first four months of 1993, and warned of an
overall operating loss for the first half of the year.
Hardest hit were the industrial giant's steel tubes division, and its
manufacture of vehicle components, with sharp falls in both orders and
turnover.
Mr Werner Dieter, group chairman, said that at least 7,700 jobs would have
to be cut from the 135,000-strong workforce, and possibly many more in the
course of the year.
However, the one area of the company's operations where it is expressing
greater optimism is its D2 mobile telephone system, the first private
network in Germany, which already has 220,000 customers.
Mannesmann, which last year boosted its turnover to DM28bn (Dollars 17.1bn)
from DM24.3bn in 1991, reflects the plight of the entire German engineering
industry.
Net profits dropped by almost half to DM339m from DM625m the previous year.
Sales in the first four months were DM7.9bn, down 4 per cent from the
comparable period of 1992, while orders stood at DM9.4bn, down 14 per cent.
Mr Dieter blamed the losses on world-wide price pressures, currency
fluctuations in Europe and one-off charges for the redundancy programme.
The pipes and tubes division, Mannesmann's traditional core unit, saw the
biggest squeeze, with a 23 per cent drop in turnover to DM928m, and a 21 per
cent drop in orders to DM1.3bn.
Two joint-venture plants owned by the Europipe grouping in Germany and
France are to be closed this year, with a loss of some 600 jobs.
Mr Dieter blamed cheap steel imports from central and eastern Europe for the
plight of that division, as well as the collapse of the former Soviet
market.
He insisted, however, that the company would remain in all forms of tube
manufacturing, although it might have to consider co-operation agreements
and mergers with competitors.
The vehicle components division was hit by the downturn in the German car
industry, with orders in the first four months down 14 per cent to DM9.4bn.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kobe Steel forced to cut profits
forecasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KOBE Steel, a leading Japanese steelmaker, yesterday revised its long-term
management plan, sharply cutting profit forecasts for the next three years.
Most Japanese steelmakers expect a loss in the first half of this year, and
are counting on a recovery in the domestic economy in the second half.
Kobe's announcement, however, suggests unexpectedly tough conditions have
forced a review of ambitious production and diversification plans.
For the year ending March 1996, Kobe had predicted sales of Y1,810bn
(Dollars 16.5bn) and a pre-tax profit of Y118bn. However, the company has
revised the sales target down to Y1,440bn and the profit figure to Y40bn.
Kobe expects to trim its workforce by 9.5 per cent to 18,200 over the next
three years, while the payroll in the iron and steel division will be
reduced by 15.9 per cent to 7,400. Steel workers are to be transferred to
new businesses, although the company is expecting fewer sales from
diversification than originally planned.
Japanese steelmakers launched a remarkable range of diversification projects
during the 1980s, including a mushroom farm and an artificial beach.
However, the most ambitious foray was into electronics, in the belief that
as steel had been the 'industrial rice' of the past, so semiconductors would
be the 'rice' of the future.
In its long-term management plan released in December 1991, Kobe had
predicted that the electronics and information division would account for
about 13 per cent of sales in the year ending in March 1996, up from 6 per
cent last year. However, that target has been revised to 9 per cent, which
includes sales at its property development arm.
Over the next three years, Kobe expects capital spending to be around Y60bn
annually, down by half from investment during the 1990-92 period.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENICHEM, the troubled Italian state-owned chemicals group which lost
L1,560bn (Dollars 1.06bn) after tax in 1992, has forecast gross operating
profits of about L1,000bn this year due to restructuring measures.
The claim by Mr Giorgio Porta, EniChem's outgoing chairman, has been greeted
with some scepticism given the size of last year's losses, which were well
above expectations.
Mr Porta, who is being replaced by Mr Marcello Colitti, said EniChem's
biggest problem was the size of its debts and interest charges. Interest
costs, adjusted for disposals, rose by L131bn to L893bn in 1992, while total
net debt climbed to L7,391bn from L7,004bn, in spite of a cash injection
from the Eni group.
Mr Porta said gross operating profits had risen by 46 per cent to L230bn by
end-March and should reach L400bn by mid-year - 33 per cent above the
corresponding figure for 1992 and 50 per cent higher when adjusted for
acquisitions and disposals. Last year, gross operating profits totalled
L586bn.
First-quarter sales in 1993 were L2,700bn, 4 per cent below the same period
last year. Adjusted for disposals, revenues rose by 5 per cent.

CONSTANTIA, the diversified Austrian manufacturing group, reported a 35 per
cent decline to Sch350m (Dollars 31.3m) in net income for 1992 on turnover
little changed at Sch11bn, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich.
The fall in profit was exaggerated by the way that 1991 earnings were
inflated by the sale of the group's paper factory.
Constantia, 75 per cent owned by the Turnauer family, expects flat sales
again this year and a slide in cash flow from last year's Sch950m to between
Sch800m and Sch900m.

FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Court holds key to Ciga's future
/ Examining the problems facing the Italian hotels chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGA, the Italian luxury hotels chain controlled by the racehorse-loving Aga
Khan, faces an important hurdle next week when a Milan judge will rule on
the freezing of the company's assets.
A freeze on Ciga assets was provisionally granted to a group of banks owed
money by Fimpar, the holding company, which controls Ciga. The move,
revealed last month, led to the suspension of stock market trading in Ciga
and Fimpar shares.
Ciga is no stranger to suspension. Last December, trading was halted pending
a last-minute rescue plan after the collapse of an earlier project to sell
some of its famous hotels to raise cash.
The group owns or runs some of Italy's most luxurious hotels, such as Rome's
Grand and Milan's Principe di Savoia, as well as a number of top hotels
outside Italy. Occupancy rates have been hit severely by recession, and
expansion ahead of the 1990 soccer world cup led Ciga to invest heavily at
the expense of borrowings.
The upshot has been a string of losses in recent years. The net loss for
1992 was L251.9bn (Dollars 172.2m), up from a loss of L98.8bn in 1991, on
revenues of L510bn. Group borrowings are now believed to be about L1,200bn.
It is debt which has triggered the latest crisis for the group. The share
suspensions followed legal action by IMI Bank, the German subsidiary of a
leading Italian investment banking and long-term lending group, which led a
Dollars 100m three-year revolving credit facility for Fimpar. The facility
matured on May 4, and was not renewed pending negotiations between Fimpar
and its creditors.
Those talks are still going on. Apart from the stake in Ciga, Fimpar's main
assets comprise an 11.7 per cent shareholding in the Sardinia-based airline,
Meridiana.
Although IMI Bank's move looks like a direct attack on Fimpar to force
repayment of the Dollars 100m credit, analysts say the strategy is more
complex. While Fimpar owes its banks money, the bulk of the borrowings by
the Aga Khan's companies is by Ciga.
Ciga's bankers, which have been conducting separate rescheduling and rescue
talks with the company, approved in March a plan to give Mediobanca, the
Milan-based merchant bank, the mandate to seek a solution to its problems.
That is likely to involve the direct sale of some assets or a big capital
increase reserved for one or more outside partners. The depressed state of
the property market and the failure of Goldman Sachs, appointed by Ciga to
find buyers for some hotels last year, to come up with acceptable offers,
suggests a capital increase is the most likely recourse.
But diluting Fimpar's stake in Ciga, which is now just in excess of 50 per
cent, does not appeal to Fimpar's bank creditors. Dilution of the stake in
its biggest and most valuable asset affects Fimpar's creditworthiness -
triggering the bankers' legal moves.
Matters are complicated by the fact that different banks lent to Ciga and
Fimpar. Only Barclays and Banca di Roma lent to both; the other Fimpar banks
do not necessarily have the same priorities as Ciga's bank creditors.
Earlier this year Ciga's bankers turned down a Ciga-inspired rescue scheme
which would have brought in an outside investor to raise cash.
The banks' objection was that the deal, which involved the sale of a
majority stake in the hotel-owning Ciga Immobiliare property subsidiary,
undervalued the assets.
Less publicly, there may also have been some uneasiness about the source of
funds and identity of the buyer, a private Italian property and leisure
group, Situr.
Mediobanca's rescue plan will not be ready before Ciga's annual meeting at
the end of this month. Once unveiled, it must still be approved by the
banks. Then Mediobanca has to find one or more companies prepared to invest
in Ciga. It may be a good long-term prospect, given present depressed
property prices and the large amounts already spent to upgrade many hotels.
But before that can happen, Ciga, Fimpar and their bankers must resolve
their latest disagreement. Many analysts believe IMI Bank's freeze is a
tactical move to gain representation at the Ciga banks' negotiating table -
from which all Fimpar's lenders except Barclays and Banca di Roma are
excluded.
If that is all, the problem should not drag on too long. But even then,
Ciga, Fimpar and the Aga Khan will have to find a long-term solution for the
group.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nac Re to establish reinsurance arm in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAC RE Corporation, the eighth largest US reinsurance company, intends to
inject Pounds 50m into a new London-based reinsurance subsidiary.
The move signals growing investor interest in international reinsurance
markets where rates are increasing following heavy losses in recent years
and represents a vote of confidence for the London reinsurance market which
has seen a number of withdrawals in recent months.
'The accelerated pace of change in the London market and the need for
stable, financially secure reinsurers, presents Nac Re with an exceptional
opportunity to expand and diversify its client bade,' said Mr Ronald
Bornhuetter, president and chief executive.
'We believe that London remains the best location to assess high quality
international reinsurance business,' he added.
Several large companies, including Victory Re, the subsidiary of
International Nederlande Groep and NWRe, the joint venture between
Winterthur of Switzerland, Norwich Union and Chiyoda, pulled out of the
market earlier this year and a number of other players have reduced their
exposures.
Nac Re is establishing a London contact office for the new venture, pending
regulatory approval. Mr Charles Catt, formerly assistant general manager
with NWRe, is to head the new venture. Mr Bornhuetter said Mr Catt 'shares
our commitment to financial security, disciplined underwriting and superior
client service.'
Nac Re underwrote gross premiums of Dollars 366m (Pounds 238m) in 1992.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Excavator that ploughs a lonely furrow - JC
Bamford maps out its strategy to improve profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE raised eyebrows at the Chelsea Flower Show last week when a
hitherto unknown plant species, skidsteerloaderus britanicus, was found
nestling coyly among the more conventional flora.
The challenge to horticultural orthodoxy was mounted by JC Bamford
Excavators, Britain's biggest construction equipment company and no
shrinking violet when it comes to publicity. It was all because a new bright
yellow rose, Mr JCB, was being named in honour of Mr Joe Bamford, the
company's 76-year-old founder.
However, Mr Bamford's son, Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the
Staffordshire-based group since 1975, is currently more concerned with
growing profits than plants.
In an interview with the Financial Times at the Samoter construction
equipment show in Verona, the JCB chief mapped out the company's future
strategy, revealed how he wanted to improve JCB's profitability, and let
slip a few numbers from the privately-held company's accounts.
The past three years have been tough for JCB, one of the UK's most widely
admired engineering companies. Sir Anthony said the maker of backhoe
loaders, telescopic handlers and other earthmoving and agricultural
equipment had seen profits fall from a peak of nearly Pounds 50m in 1988 to
a group net figure of Pounds 9m last year, on a decline in sales from Pounds
450m to Pounds 350m.
However, unlike the majority of its larger and smaller rivals, debt-free JCB
has stayed profitable - even while its sales volumes have dropped from a
rate of 20,000 units a year in 1988 to 9,000 units last year.
New products, a big programme to reduce break-even levels and strong sales
in Europe - until recently - have offset a recession of unprecedented length
and severity in the UK market.
Sir Anthony says he is not happy with last year's profits. 'We should be
making Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m, even at current levels of demand.' On a
conservative forecast he believes JCB could double profits this year - due
not only to new products and lower break-evens, but also to a recent
reorganisation that has put the main equipment lines into three additional
product-related profit centres. 'We needed it to make it much clearer
throughout the company that it was necessary to make a profit,' says Sir
Anthony.
And that is despite the weakness in continental markets which is worrying
the industry just as glimmers of hope are emerging in the UK. 'France is at
a dead stop, Italy has just come to a halt too, and Spain is in a terribly
bad way. The German market is about to fall off, but growth in eastern
Germany is still continuing,' says Sir Anthony.
The reorganisation should allow JCB to speed up further its product
development programme. But Sir Anthony signalled that the company was
entering a consolidation period, concentrating on developing its existing
products after a spurt of new ones over the past two years.
'We've used the recession as a time to bring new products out,' he says. 'It
shows you're not demoralised, and it's something new to go to customers
with.'
The new products include the Fastrac high-mobility vehicle - launched in
1991 and aimed at farmers - and JCB's crawler excavator range - produced at
Uttoxeter by a joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo Construction Machinery.
However, the star new product is looking like the JCB Robot skid-steer
loader, launched this spring and designed with a single boom to allow the
driver in and out through a side door. 'The acceptance has been fantastic,
and we can't keep up with demand,' enthuses Sir Anthony. 'The safety
features mean customers have to be interested.'
Already, JCB is coming under pressure from its sales subsidiaries to step up
production. Even in Italy, where sales of larger machines have come to a
virtual standstill because of the corruption scandals and the curbs on
public spending, JCB's sales subsidiary is planning to sell 180 this year.
The Sumitomo joint venture was a way for JCB to replace its outdated range
of crawler excavators, and the venture is now producing prototypes for a
wheeled excavator due to be launched next year.
However, Sir Anthony does not believe the UK company will need to make
further such ventures - either because JCB's products are already
competitive or because the UK company can fix them itself.
The main priority is to broaden and improve JCB's wheeled loader range, seen
both within and outside the company as a poor relation. 'We've got to become
a European force in wheeled loaders,' says Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive,
noting that Germany accounts for about half the market.
Sir Anthony's target is to make JCB Europe's biggest construction equipment
group - it already is in unit terms, but its European sales are a long way
behind Brussels-based VME and Caterpillar of the US, which make a lot more
larger machines.
Whatever the chances of JCB ever achieving this, Sir Anthony makes two
things clear. First, JCB has no intention of going public. 'Being private is
very important,' he says. 'It has enabled us to plough our own furrow
through the good and the bad times and not be swallowed up.'
It's not just a question of the time saved in not having to talk to
analysts, says Sir Anthony. 'All our capital investment would be looked at
in a different light if we were a public company.'
JCB would have to justify policies which the City would inevitably
criticise. Against the trend in the industry, for example, JCB makes most of
its own axles and gearboxes.
This makes good commercial sense, says Mr Coyne. 'It gives us an extra area
where we can have an edge over our rivals, and sales to outside customers
are rising.'
Secondly, Sir Anthony is sticking to a growth strategy that has achieved
success without making acquisitions, apart from one in 1968. 'We're not
speculative, it's going to be boring old organic growth,' he says.

Pounds 967,000 increase in turnover was achieved in the second half.
Borrowings at the year end stood at Pounds 733,000 (Pounds 1.66m) and
gearing was 15 per cent (34 per cent). Earnings per share of 9.81p compare

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Windsor Pounds 1.19m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDSOR, the Lloyd's broker specialising in sports, leisure and contingency
insurance, is proposing a reduction in capital to remedy the deficit on its
distributable reserves.
The move follows a property write-down of Pounds 1.7m, taken as an
exceptional charge in its interim results announced yesterday.
For the six months to March 31 pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 1.91m
(Pounds 102,000 profits) on turnover slightly ahead at Pounds 3.79m against
Pounds 3.63m. Interest charges took Pounds 106,000 (Pounds 155,000).
Mr Michael Eagles, chief executive, said the loss arose primarily because of
the increased provision on its investment property in Hemel Hempstead,
Hertfordshire. That property was likely to be sold.
He said the new management, established in 1991, continued to concentrate
successfully on core insurance activities. Underlying brokerage increased by
9 per cent in the half year.
The directors hope that the proposed capital reduction will lead to a
resumption in dividend payments should trading conditions permit. Losses per
share for the period amounted to 5.64p (0.21p earnings).
Mr Stanley Cohen, who was chairman for more than two years, has retired from
the board. A new chairman will be announced shortly.

on reduced volumes

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FABER Prest, the industrial and distribution services company, reported
half-year pre-tax profits down at Pounds 1.65m compared with Pounds 1.84m in
the previous period.
The board declared an interim dividend up 16 per cent to 5p (4.3p) out of
earnings per share down at 10.25p (11.69p). It said the company now had a
sound base from which to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Turnover for the six months to end-March fell to Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 34.7m)
with the company, which has adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard, citing
reduced volumes and margin pressure across UK markets.
The directors stated that overseas activities, now some 10 per cent of total
sales including contributions from associated companies, were performing
'satisfactorily'.
Operating profits, with the contribution of associated companies, amounted
to Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 2.31m). There were net exceptional charges for the
six months of Pounds 218,000 (Pounds 64,000 credits) relating to
reorganisations and discontinued operations.
The directors said that net borrowings were 'significantly lower' at Pounds
4m, attracting net interest of Pounds 237,000 (Pounds 530,000).

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan to make Pounds 19.3m
provision - Company pledged to pursue late payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANKS &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal company, is to set up a Pounds 19.3m
provision to cover a reorganisation of its construction division
encompassing late payments and sums relating to variations in contracts that
it is not certain it will collect.
The provisions will be taken in the year ended March 27 1993, results for
which will be announced later this month.
Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said Shanks's waste divisions traded
'satisfactorily' during the year. Pre-tax profits would be no less than
Pounds 29m before the provision announced yesterday.
The group intended to recommend a final dividend of 3.44p, unchanged from
1992.
After a sharp early fall, Shanks's share price settled down 7p at 162p.
Mr Hewitt said the group had traditionally been involved in long-term
contracts, building roads, tunnels and bridges. Due to government pressure,
payment on many of these contracts was often only being made after
protracted negotiations with central government and local government
clients.
It was no longer clear when payment would be recovered, or indeed how much
would be received. The group would now be focusing on shorter-term, and
therefore more tightly specified, contracts.
Mr Anthony Rush, former chief operating officer of Lilley, the failed
construction and property company, is being brought in as managing director
of Shanks &amp; McEwan Contractors. Mr Rush, who was on Lilley's construction
side, will replace Mr John Mackenzie, who has retired.
Mr Hewitt said the group would be vigorously pursuing payment. Should
payments be received in future years they would appear above the line in
future year's earnings.
The provision relates to about 10 main contracts, five of them large road
construction deals.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field pays Pounds 6m for Boots' carton
packaging activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIELD GROUP, the packaging company, expected shortly to publish the
pathfinder prospectus for its flotation, is paying about Pounds 6m for
Boots' carton packaging activities, part of the Boots Print subsidiary.
Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group, has contracted to buy the
majority of its pharmaceutical and toiletries cartons from Field for 5
years. It had already used some outside suppliers.
The business Field is buying had sales of Pounds 10m in the year to March
31, of which 17 per cent is for third parties. Mr Keith Gilchrist, Field's
chief executive, estimated its profits at Pounds 1m.
Field's flotation is expected to give the group a market capitalisation of
about Pounds 150m. The consideration - of Pounds 4.9m for assets of Pounds
2.4m, plus stock expected to be Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.1m - will be payable
on completion in July.
The business is similar to Field's Mareen subsidiary in Belgium, which is
the leading carton producer for the pharmaceutical industry there.
Field will move the Boots operation to new premises over the next three
years, although remaining in Nottingham. This could cost a further Pounds 3m
to Pounds 4m. About 200 jobs will be transferred to Field. Mr David
Thompson, Boots' finance director, said the business would 'benefit from
Field's expertise and market presence'.
Boots is to merge the rest of its Boots Print business - promotional print,
diaries and calendars - with the loss of about 100 jobs, although some
employees will be redeployed in Boots.

WESTLAND Group, the helicopter manufacturer, produced higher-than-expected
half-year profits of Pounds 12.8m even though it did not deliver a single
new helicopter during the period.
The pre-tax figure for the six months to April 2 was 23 per cent up on the
previous first half's Pounds 10.4m. 'This was a bit better than our plans,'
Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said.
Earnings per share were 5.7p (4.8p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at
1.25p. Its shares closed 14p up at 187p.
The profit increase came despite higher costs of Pounds 2.6m for
restructuring businesses supplying the depressed civil aircraft market. That
compared with exceptional charges of Pounds 900,000.
Mr Jones said the result reflected improved productivity across the whole
group. Operating profits before restructuring costs were up in all
divisions. This included the Normalair-Garrett equipment subsidiary, which
Mr Jones said had 'returned to normal margins'.
Half-year sales increased from Pounds 198m to Pounds 220m, with the gap in
helicopter production compensated by support and upgrade work.
Westland expects to supply about four Lynx helicopters to Portugal in the
second half. But deliveries are not scheduled to pick up significantly until
1996-97 with the new EH101 naval and utility helicopter, a joint venture
between Westland and Agusta of Italy.
Mr Jones was optimistic that Canada would stick by its plan to purchase the
EH101 although the contract had been called into question by the country's
Liberal opposition. Canada's order of 50 helicopters is the largest to have
been placed, exceeding the 44 ordered for the Royal Navy. Italy has been
negotiating a contract for 16 EH101s with options on eight more.
Westland still had 'a good chance' of selling Sikorsky-licensed Black Hawk
helicopters to Saudi Arabia, Mr Jones said. This might involve a direct
contract with Westland rather than through British Aerospace, the lead
company in the UK's Al Yamamah defence supply package for the Saudis.
COMMENT
Westland is a lesson in patience. It would be hard to expect much more of
the company, given the gap in helicopter orders and the downturn in civil
aerospace. The lull is due to last another two years or so, during which it
will have to concentrate on cutting costs further. Before then, GKN could
sell the 21 per cent stake it bought in 1988, when it had ambitious plans
for its defence interests. On the other hand, with a Pounds 1.91bn order
backlog Westland promises subsequently to become a significant cash
generator, irrespective of whether its long-awaited Saudi contract ever
materialises. As in the past three years, the company is obviously reserving
dividend growth for the final payment when it is expected to nudge the total
up from last year's 4.25p. The City is expecting full year pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 30m (Pounds 26.3m)for a p/e of 16 to 17.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Orchestrators of a classic change of tempo
 -The background to the rapidly improving fortunes of Cray Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER Michael is not only busy getting Classic FM, the radio station
where he is the single largest shareholder, off to a flying start. He and
his fellow board members at Cray Electronics are orchestrating another
unexpected success story.
Cray, no relation to the US supercomputer maker, is the former high
technology wonder stock brought low by mismanagement and controversial
accounting policies.
The 1989 debacle resulted in the injection of a new management team led by
Sir Peter as chairman and his colleagues, Mr Roger Holland and Mr Jon
Richards, as deputy chairman and managing director respectively. The three
made their collective name turning round UEI, an engineering group they sold
in 1989 to Carlton Communications for Pounds 508m.
Cray, a diverse collection of electronics-related companies burdened by
heavy debt, looked a stiffer challenge. Sir Peter said at the time that the
company was in serious trouble and that recovery would take two to three
years. Analysts were understandably cautious: 'A speculative investment' was
one conclusion; 'not for the risk averse', another.
Now the music has changed tempo. Cray's share price stands at 154p, up from
a low of 32p, giving a market capitalisation of about Pounds 300m. Net debt,
which at one stage in 1989 amounted to almost Pounds 50m, has been
eliminated through margin improvements, cost reductions and the disposal of
14 of the company's rag-bag of businesses. There is net cash of Pounds 10m.
Turnover in the year to April 1993 is likely to be Pounds 200m and the City
is estimating taxable profits at Pounds 17m: 'The group will not disappoint
market expectations', says NatWest Securities in a bullish note this month.
Mr Holland has now taken over as chairman; Sir Peter remains a non-executive
director. Cost cutting and disposals sowed the seeds of Cray's recovery but
with interests ranging from aerospace systems to sonar equipment, the
business lacked focus. The key to Cray's new-found credibility seems to be
the Pounds 50m acquisition in July last year of Dowty IT, the information
technology interests of the Dowty engineering group.
What Cray bought in Dowty IT was principally Case Communications, a small
UK-based data communications company with a good reputation for technology
but an indifferent business track record. The Dowty acquisition enabled the
management to group its various businesses into three more or less natural
divisions - Cray Communications, Cray Systems and Cray Technology. Cray
Systems, turning over 20 per cent of group revenues, includes the software
products and services; the company is the leading supplier of software to
the European Space Agency and is the market leader in systems for tour and
ferry operators.
Cray Technology, generating 15 per cent of group revenues, is, as group
managing director Mr Jon Richards accepts, a disparate bundle of electronics
concerns most of which are related to the defence industries including high
resolution computer graphics displays and high security power supplies. They
are, he says, non-core businesses, but the individual activities are
profitable; the strategy is to drive down costs while building long-term
partnerships with customers.
Cray Communications, however, with likely sales last year of Pounds 130m, or
65 per cent of group turnover, is the principal plank in the group's
strategy. Formed by merging the activities of Cray's own communications
division with Dowty Case and Dowty Information Systems, its products and
services are at the heart of the one of the fastest growing areas of
business technology.
Companies are increasingly connecting their personal computers together in
local area networks (lans), going on to create enterprise-wide
communications by linking lans together using wide area networking (wan)
technology.
According to the market consultancies IDC and Dataquest, the market for wan
access and lan interconnect products is expected to grow from Dollars 1.9bn
in 1986 to Dollars 10.1bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in 1996, or 500 per cent growth in
10 years. Products where growth of more than 50 per cent a year is expected
include lan hubs, data communications using asynchronous transfer mode (atm)
rules, a likely standard for future high capacity networks and frame relay,
a high speed, low cost communication technique for voice and data.
Cray is active in all these technologies. It claims to be the European
market leader in wide area networks and number three in the world after
Motorola and Racal. It also reckons to be number eight in the intensely
competitive lan business behind new stars of the communications business
like Novell, Cisco and 3Com, all of the US.
The strategy seems sound but execution, especially in the frenetic world of
electronics, is another matter.
Mr Richards says his business imperatives are to invest further in
manufacturing, exploit the strength of the company networking products and
unify worldwide operations. The objective is to raise gross margins to the
14 per cent level some time next year.
The company continues to suffer, however, from a lack of visibility. If
potential investors recognise it at all, they remember the dodgy accounting
saga or the abortive bid for SD-Scicon, where it was pipped at the post by
EDS. A spectacular success in the marketplace would underscore its claim to
be one of the UK's leading IT companies.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ex-communists help De La Rue rise 34%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVIDING bank notes and passports for 26 former communist countries helped
De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, offset the
declining world demand for cheques.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 increased by 34 per cent from Pounds
77.9m to Pounds 104.7m, which was at the top end of City expectations. Sales
rose by 35 per cent to Pounds 559.5m, against Pounds 415.4m, which included
Pounds 15.1m from discontinued activities.
The biggest jump in profits came from payment systems, which included a full
year's contribution from Inter Innovation, the Swedish competitor it
acquired for Pounds 94.7m at the end of 1991.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the overall market for cheques
fell by 2 per cent last year, and was expected to continue to decline at
similar or increasing rates as debit cards became established. However there
was no sign of a drop in demand for banknotes in any market.
De La Rue supplies the Royal Bank of Scotland and some building societies
with debit cards incorporating laser-engraved users' photographs, which have
sharply reduced fraud levels.
Yesterday, the company also announced a joint sales venture in the UK and
Irish Republic with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, to develop 'smart
cards', which use embedded microchips to authorise transactions.
Strong internal cash generation helped the group increase its net cash over
the year from Pounds 111.5m to Pounds 170.9m at March 31. Mr Marshall said
the group was ready to expand, but any acquisition would have to be in a
related area and enhance earnings, which was not a common combination.
Operating profits grew by 22 per cent to Pounds 79.4m, compared with Pounds
65m which included profits on discontinued activities of Pounds 1.4m.
Payment systems accounted for 59 per cent of sales and 46 per cent of
operating profits, compared with 48 per cent and 36 per cent previously.
Lord Limerick, the chairman, said 'the group has entered the new year with
strong order books in the major businesses and we look forward to continued
earnings growth in the current year.'
The proportion of the group's sales arising outside the UK and Ireland
increased from 90 to 91 per cent. Sales in the rest of Europe increased from
44 to 48 per cent, including an increase in Germany from 26 to 28 per cent.
Earnings per share rose by 24 per cent to 38.8p (31.2p). A 14 per cent
increase in the recommended final dividend to 13.15p gives a total for the
year of 17p against 15p, a 13 per cent advance.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nissan's UK subsidiary advances 66% to
Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR Manufacturing (UK), the Japanese car maker's British car
production subsidiary which is based in Sunderland Tyne and Wear, increased
its 1992 pre-tax profit by 66 per cent from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 29.6m.
Nissan Motor (GB), the group's British sales and marketing subsidiary,
suffered a loss of close to Pounds 17m in its first year of operation.
NMGB took control of the British importing/distribution activities from
Nissan UK, the privately owned group controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, at the
beginning of 1992.
By the end of the year NMGB had established a 270-strong dealer network,
which is expected to grow to about 300 by the end of 1993.
NMUK's profit was its second successive annual surplus since it began car
production in the UK in 1986 and followed a Pounds 44.6m loss in the nine
months to the end of 1990.
The losses accumulated since 1985, which totalled Pounds 129m at the end of
1990, were reduced to Pounds 111m by the end of 1991 and were cut further to
Pounds 88m by the end of last year.
The remuneration of Mr Ian Gibson, NMUK chief executive, rose by 11.9 per
cent from Pounds 192,797 to Pounds 215,800.
Average employment in Sunderland by the NMUK group, which includes Nissan
Yamato Engineering, its 80 per cent-owned heavy pressings subsidiary, rose
to 4,974 in 1992 from 3,368 a year earlier. NMUK alone has a workforce of
about 4,600 with some 600 employed by Nissan Yamato.
The financial performance of the British manufacturing operation provided a
bright spot in a difficult year for Nissan, Japan's second largest car
maker, which last week announced a group pre-tax loss of Y108bn (Pounds
645m) in the 12 months to the end of March.
NMUK's turnover jumped last year to Pounds 1.05bn against Pounds 779m in
1991 and Pounds 383m in the final nine months of 1990.
The higher turnover and profits at its Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland
in north-east England was derived from a big jump in output as Nissan began
production of a second car range, the Micra small car, in August last year.
Nissan's car production in the UK rose by 44 per cent last year to 179,000
against 124,500 in 1991. Exports rose from 112,700 to 154,234.
Nissan is planning to raise car production in the UK further, by 51 per cent
this year to 270,000.

FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Evening Post at Pounds 4.1m and
cautious for this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COST-CUTTING helped to boost profits at Bristol Evening Post, the regional
newspaper group which recently shrugged off Mr David Sullivan, its long-time
hostile shareholder and Sunday Sport publisher.
The group announced a 22 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m on
sales 1 per cent lower at Pounds 60.6m for the year to March 31. The figures
compared with profits of Pounds 3.35m on turnover of Pounds 61.4m.
The profit advance was helped by the introduction of FRS 3 which resulted in
the comparative profits being restated downwards. Last year's reported
figure was Pounds 4.06m.
Mr Stanley Clarke, chairman, said the loss of 122 production and
distribution jobs had resulted in a Pounds 1.14m reduction in staff costs.
However, the company was still cautious on trading for the present year. Mr
Clarke said both advertising and circulation were running at lower levels
than last year.
'The recovery will be slow,' he said. 'The current situation is still
erratic.' As a result, the final proposed dividend is being maintained at
7.75p, making a total for the year of 11.75p, a 2 per cent advance on last
year's 11.5p. Earnings per share were 1.2p ahead at 11p.
The group took a Pounds 1.8m charge to pay for the costs of the
reorganisation, which was offset by a Pounds 1.6m profit on the sale of
investments.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Bankers mount attack on fortress France: Moves by foreign
bankers to secure a stake in the privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the next few weeks hordes of bankers will troop into the glass towers
of the French finance ministry to bid for business in the new privatisation
programme.
The sale of 21 state-controlled companies over the next two years could
provide a lucrative source of business for the international banks that
have, for years, been building up their operations in Paris.
But past French governments have shown a chauvinistic streak in their choice
of advisers. Plum roles have gone to Gallic banks such as Societe Generale
and Credit Lyonnais.
Foreign banks hope that the new administration will be more internationally
minded. They may be disappointed.
The last right-wing French government did at least pay lip service to the
principle of internationalisation during its FFr120bn (Pounds 13bn) share
sales from 1986 to 1988. The rule was that a French bank was appointed as
lead adviser for the domestic part of the issue and a foreign one for the
international tranche.
This did at least give US, UK and Swiss banks a chance to participate.
In the flotation of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Credit Lyonnais acted as
chief domestic adviser with Morgan Stanley as chief international adviser.
Credit Commercial de France and Goldman Sachs played the same respective
roles in the privatisation of Societe Generale. SG Warburg was chief
international adviser for the Havas sale and lead manager for the UK on
Alcatel-Alsthom.
The preference for French banks was partly a reflection of the unusually
close links between politics and finance in France. Even today two of
France's biggest banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, and
three of its largest insurers are owned by the state. As a result many of
France's largest financial institutions are run by civil servants who were
educated at the elite grandes ecoles alongside the people who are now
orchestrating the privatisation programme.
Preference aside, another reason French banks dominated the deals was that
foreign investors were only allowed to hold a maximum 20 per cent stake in a
newly privatised company.
In theory, the new French government should be more open-minded in its
choice of advisers. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has
abolished the 20 per cent ceiling. And since the mid-1980s, international
investors have played an increasingly prominent part in the Paris stock
market.
'Maybe, just maybe, we've seen the last of the old 'Fortress France'
mentality,' said one American banker in Paris.
But in practice there are signs that the role of international banks will be
severely restricted in the new privatisation drive. The socialist government
set a precedent by appointing French banks as its chief advisers on both the
domestic and main international parts of its partial privatisation
programme.
The new administration says it has not yet decided how to organise the next
set of share sales, but early signals suggest it will stick to the cosy old
ways.
Mr Alphandery has said he plans to revive the noyaux durs, the friendly
investors that take long term stakes in newly privatised concerns. Most of
these will be industrial partners keen to form alliances with the old
state-controlled groups. But others will be banks, eager to strengthen their
client relationships.
Societe Generale played an active part in the last privatisation round, both
in its own sale to the private sector and as an adviser on other issues.
Last month it joined a group of three investors taking minority stakes in
the Total oil group. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, announced last week that it
also envisaged raising its holdings in Rhone-Poulenc and Assurances
Generales de France, both privatisation prospects. It saw itself acting as
as 'adviser, vendor and investor' in the new issues.
Most foreign financiers suspect the French government will favour noyaux
durs investors when selecting its advisers. 'It's impossible to think that
it won't make a difference,' a British banker commented ruefully.
Mr Alphandery has said he hopes to encourage foreign investors to act as
noyaux durs. But Anglo-Saxon investment bankers have traditionally been less
enthusiastic about 'industrial banking' than their continental European
counterparts. 'The cost of taking a stake in a privatised French company is
too high a price to pay,' said one.
The critical question is whether the French banks are capable of handling
the issues on their own. They do have a significant weakness in that none of
them, not even Paribas, which has the highest international profile, has an
adequate equity distribution network outside France.
'Distribution could become a serious problem if an issue proved difficult to
sell,' said a British banker. 'But that doesn't seem very likely. After all,
French privatisations have usually sold themselves.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Alpine tells employees trading has 'ceased'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALPINE (Double Glazing), one of the oldest names in the UK window industry,
yesterday announced it had ceased trading.
Alpine, purchased from administrators by a group of unnamed buyers in
February 1992, sent a letter to staff stating it had suffered 'substantial
bad debts'.
Once owned by ADT, Alpine went into administration in August 1991. The
administrators sold the business for Pounds 900,000 to a group backed by the
Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith. Events at two companies once linked
with Mr Smith, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Butte, are being investigated by the
Serious Fraud Office. Mr Smith, facing the threat of personal bankruptcy, is
due to appear before creditors owed Pounds 20m next week with proposals for
an individual voluntary arrangement.
Yesterday there appeared to be confusion among Alpine's employees. Security
guards at the Newcastle factory said the premises had been closed for a
week's holiday.
The chief executive Mr Robin Speirs refused to comment on events, although
he confirmed Alpine had ceased trading. The group is thought to have
defaulted on payments for services such as advertising and materials. Many
of its employees have not been paid. The news comes just weeks after the
group sponsored a horse race at substantial cost - the Alpine Double Glazing
Derby Trial at Lingfield.
Alpine's directors included Mr James Berry, associated with Mr Smith through
his role at Corporate Broking Services, which collapsed in 1991. Mr Smith
held a substantial stake in CBS.

FT  02 JUN 93 / ADT lines up Dollars 1.3bn refinancing: Deal involves new
Dollars 500m credit facility, Dollars 600m public debt offering plus share
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the security services and car auction company, is to make a public
share offering in the US to help refinance Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 840m) of
debt and preference share obligations.
The share issue should raise more than Dollars 150m. The Bermuda-based
company has also received commitments for a new Dollars 500m credit facility
from Bank of Nova Scotia and Chemical Bank.
Completing the three-part package, ADT expects to register details of a
Dollars 600m public debt offering with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Mr David Hammond, ADT deputy chairman, said the package aimed to clear up
all the 'financial question marks' surrounding the group, which conducts
most of its business in the US.
The package will allow payment next year of Dollars 435m to holders of
preference shares who are likely to exercise put options. It also extends
the repayment schedule for Dollars 750m of debt through 1995.
The company hopes the refinancing will end a turbulent period in which its
share price has fallen from about Pounds 20 in 1990 to 570p yesterday. While
the company's share price was sliding, Laidlaw of Canada, the largest
shareholder, sued in a New York court claiming ADT had produced 'an illusory
profit stream'. The case was dropped, after Laidlaw got board
representation.
Mr Ashcroft, however, continues to attract attention. According to documents
filed with the SEC, he received more than Pounds 2m in salary and payments
in lieu of pension in 1992 and a salary of Pounds 1.44m in 1991.
After the refinancing, ADT's gearing will still be more than 100 per cent.
Mr Hammond said there would be no need for further refinancing for five
years.
'We will now concentrate on nothing but security services and vehicle
auctions.'
The public offering of 18m shares is a substantially smaller issue than many
observers had suspected would be necessary, limiting dilution of existing
shareholders to 16.4 per cent.
The Dollars 600m of public debt is split into Dollars 250m of senior
seven-year debt and Dollars 350m of 10-year subordinated debt. Half the bank
facility amortises over six years beginning in 1994, while half is payable
in its entirety in six years' time. The share offer will be managed by First
Boston Corp and Merrill Lynch.

FT  02 JUN 93 / New-ICI rebounds as Zeneca falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE demerger of Imperial Chemical Industries was completed yesterday with
the start of official trading in the shares of the two new companies. Shares
in new-ICI, encompassing chemicals, paints, materials and explosives, got
off to a better start than those of Zeneca, the bioscience business.
New-ICI shares closed at 636p, up 28p from the previous 'grey market' price,
with 5.5m shares traded.
Demand for the shares, regarded as a cyclical recovery play, was reported
from the US. The rise was also attributed to a rebound as the shares had
been driven down ahead of the demerger.
Zeneca shares, ex the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, fell 2p to 630p while the
nil-paid shares settled 3p down at 34p. Volume in Zeneca shares was 10m with
another 2.6m dealt in the nil-paid.
Zeneca's 5-for-16 rights issue, which closes on June 21, is priced at 600p.
Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, said he was 'not worried' about
the nearness of the Zeneca price to the rights level.
He said the syndicate formed to drum up demand from international investors
for Zeneca, to be satisfied by purchases of the nil-paid shares in the
market, had got off to 'a good steady start'.
Mr Paul Woodhouse, pharmaceuticals analyst at Smith New Court, the
stockbroker, said: 'Although Zeneca will do better than many companies in
the sector during the coming years, it will be behind the best. The p/e for
1994 puts Zeneca at 12.5, with SmithKline Beecham at 12.7, Glaxo at 12.3 and
Wellcome on 13.5.'
Analysts expect that uncertainty about the coming healthcare reforms in the
US will continue to unsettle the sector.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Kohl urges calm after protests: Third night of
demonstrations in Germany against racist violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Turkish and German demonstrators took to the streets of German
cities again last night to protest against racist violence, in spite of an
appeal for calm from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The continuing wave of anger followed the deaths at the weekend of two
Turkish women and three girls in an arson attack, blamed on teenage
skinheads professing neo-Nazi sympathies.
One youth was in police custody last night, and the authorities issued the
description of four more skinheads suspected of involvement in the attack,
in the steelmaking city of Solingen, north of Cologne. Later they withdrew
the description, saying it might be false.
Hundreds of angry Turkish youths went on a rampage for the third consecutive
night in Solingen. Shouting 'Turkey, Turkey' and 'Nazis out', they smashed
shop windows and taunted riot police.
Demonstrations also flared in other cities with a lot of Turkish migrant
workers, such as Bielefeld, Munster, Dusseldorf, Dortmund and Kassel.
Mr Kohl, who gave no immediate response to the deaths on Saturday night,
issued a joint appeal for calm with Mr Johannes Rau, the premier of North
Rhine-Westphalia and caretaker leader of the opposition Social Democratic
(SPD) party.
They expressed their understanding for the anger, as well as fear and
sorrow, which has exploded in Germany's 1.7m-strong Turkish community. They
also gave their support for peaceful demonstrations.
However, they urged the community not to react with violence. 'We must
prevent injustice causing more injustice,' they said. 'There is no
justification for violent excesses.'
They condemned attempts by 'small groups of Turkish fanatics' to settle
internal disputes under cover of the mass demonstrations, after several
incidents of faction-fighting. 'If German and Turkish rioters now career
through our towns, then that makes no contribution to the peaceful and
friendly co-existence between Germans and foreigners, even if these actions
are carried out in the name of the fight against xenophobia,' they said.
President Richard von Weizsacker announced that he would be attending a
funeral service at the mosque in Cologne for the five murder victims. On
Friday, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, will attend the burial of the
victims in their former home, 125 miles north-east of Ankara.
German reaction to this atrocity has been both horror-struck and helpless,
as the authorities blame a rash of skinhead gangs for a spate of arson
attacks on foreigners. The attacks have sparked an urgent debate on
immigration law and naturalisation laws. The SPD yesterday repeated its call
for a dual citizenship right for those born in the country. Three draft laws
on the issue are before parliament.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Clinton ready to compromise on deficit proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday declared he was willing to accept smaller
tax increases and deeper spending cuts in order to get his deficit reduction
plan through Congress.
In a speech conspicuous for its bipartisan tone, he said the US must 'move
beyond entitlement and abandonment'. Democrats had to accept that not all
cherished social programmes could be fully funded, as in the past, while
Republicans should recognise that it was impossible 'to abandon the cities'.
The address to a lunch organised by conservative and other groups in
Milwaukee, a blue collar Democratic city, was replete with campaign-style
pleas for a new political consensus. Washington, he said, had to forget
'brain dead politics from either party' and seize 'the historic moment to
regain control of our economic destiny'.
He did not specify which of his proposed new taxes might be cut and where
spending might be reduced more sharply. Indeed, he continued to defend his
overall programme as 'balanced and fair'. But it is widely assumed that the
proposed energy tax will not emerge from the Senate later this month in
anything like the broad-based form in which it passed the House last week.
Mr Clinton's willingness to compromise on the energy tax has already
elicited optimistic forecasts from conservative Democratic critics such as
oil-state senators David Boren of Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana that
an amended budget package stands a fair chance in the Senate. The
prospective change in the tax and spending mix of his proposals may also
appeal to some moderate Republican senators.
Mr Clinton received some support for his attack on the federal deficit from
the independent Congressional Budget Office yesterday, which reported that
his proposals would 'curtail but not arrest' growth in the national debt and
interest payments.
His pitch on the need for greater investment was also underlined by mixed
economic data which pointed, at best, to only weak expansion last month. The
purchasing managers index showed a modest increase to 51.1 per cent from the
49.7 per cent of April, but statistics on personal income and construction
spending showed no changes in April compared with March.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Council will cut the pay of teachers who reject tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE-controlled Westminster City Council is planning to dock the pay
of head teachers and teachers who refuse to co-operate with the national
curriculum tests, due to start in secondary schools next week.
The council's approach angered the National Association of Head Teachers,
which will be addressed today by Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
while other teachers' unions suggested it was unnecessarily provocative. The
three largest unions have all voted to boycott the tests for this year.
A letter from Westminster's director of education to all the city's
governing bodies and headteachers says: 'Head teachers who refuse to
co-operate in carrying out national curriculum testing and teachers who
refuse to follow a reasonable instruction to do so should have deductions
made from their salary.'
It adds: 'Even though teachers might be working normally in other ways, a
refusal to co-operate in assessment and testing would still be in breach of
contract and pay deductions should be made.'
Westminster's line is more aggressive than the lenient conditions
recommended by Mr Patten last month, which did not mention pay deductions or
any other disciplinary action. He said heads would have performed their
legal duties if they 'gave a clear lead that the professional course is to
administer the tests', and 'satisfied themselves that teachers have been
reminded of their duty to administer the tests'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'Westminster's letter is inaccurate and requires heads to
take on an obligation to deliver the impossible.'
The NAHT would challenge any salary deductions, he said. He added that in
the 'vast majority' of cases, responsible heads would cancel the tests
altogether.
Mr Eamonn O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said changes announced by Mr Patten
meant the test boycott would probably be lifted next year.
He said: 'The reality is that the tests for this year are virtually defunct.
I don't think a local education authority should try to ignore that reality,
particularly over something which is on the way to general resolution.'
Last night Westminster appeared to be isolated in its strong stance. Mr
Donald Naismith, chief education officer of neighbouring Wandsworth, also
Conservative-controlled, said his authority had decided against using pay
deductions.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Sugar says his 48% stake in Tottenham is not for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN SUGAR, the chairman of Tottenham Hotspur football club, yesterday
insisted he would not sell his 48 per cent stake in the club to Mr Terry
Venables, the Spurs chief executive he is trying to sack, or to anyone else.
Mr Sugar, intensifying the public relations battle running parallel to the
legal proceedings between the two men, also stated he would not be beaten
into submission by 'intimidating' tactics of the media and demonstrators. In
a letter to Tottenham staff, later released to the press, Mr Sugar said he
had no intention whatsoever of selling his shares.
'You can be sure that I will most strenuously object to any such suggestion
no matter how long or how far up the legal ladder it goes,' he said.
Mr Venables' camp claims it has three backers willing to help him buy out Mr
Sugar's 48 per cent stake and mount a full bid for the club.
In his letter Mr Sugar also accused the press of creating a 'Sugar/Venables
war'. He continued: 'It is rumoured that this is a strategy to wear me down
personally so that I will simply turn round and say 'What the hell am I
involved in all this aggravation for' and walk away.
'No matter how intimidating the press comments are about me or how
intimidating the demonstrations are, such as that outside the court the
other day, or how intimidating any such demonstrations outside my house may
be, I will not wane and give in to these types of tactics.'
The two men will make their next High Court appearance on Tuesday when Mr
Sugar attempts to have lifted the injunction which has so far prevented him
dismissing Mr Venables.
Tomorrow the two men are set to make their first joint public appearance
since last week's court hearing. They are due to join other football figures
at a press conference at Tottenham's ground to launch the Makita
International Soccer Tournament, a close season contest.

THOUSANDS of Turkish and German demonstrators took to the streets of German

The continuing wave of anger followed the deaths at the weekend of two
Turkish women and three girls in an arson attack, blamed on teenage

One youth was in police custody last night, and the authorities issued the
description of four more skinheads suspected of involvement in the attack,
in the steelmaking city of Solingen, north of Cologne. Later they withdrew
the description, saying it might be a hoax.
Autobahns in several parts of the Ruhr industrial region were blocked by
Turkish protesters on Monday night and yesterday morning, after a second
night of rioting left windows smashed in banks, shops and restaurants in
Solingen.
Demonstrations were under way again last night in Solingen, as well as other
big centres of Turkish migrant workers like Bielefeld, Munster, Dusseldorf,
Dortmund and Kassel.
Mr Kohl, who had failed to issue any immediate response to the deaths on
Saturday night, yesterday issued a joint appeal for calm with Mr Johannes

the opposition Social Democratic party.

very coherent political philosophy, for a spate of arson attacks on
foreigners.
They have sparked an increasingly urgent debate on the whole question of
immigration law, and German naturalisation laws. The SPD yesterday repeated
its call for a dual citizenship right for all those born in the country.
Three draft laws on the issue are now before parliament.
At the same time, media comment has focused on the damage caused by the
murderers to Germany's good name abroad.
'The shameful deeds of a few fanatics have meant that Germans in the entire
world have once again been condemned to the corner of moral inferiority,'
the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said in yesterday's edition.

FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Shanks &amp; McEwan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Shanks &amp; McEwan need strong stomachs. The 1991 profits
warning, around which revolved the recent insider dealing case involving Mr
Thorold Mackie, put paid to the fancy rating - over 40 times historic
earnings at the peak. Since then it has been downhill almost all the way.
The company had underperformed the market by 30 per cent this year before
yesterday's surprise announcement of provisions on the construction side.
Since the shares barely flinched, though, one might reasonably wonder
whether Shanks has bottomed.
The Pounds 19m provision against a construction business which turned over
Pounds 48m last year looks prudent. Since a good portion covers doubtful
payments for public sector construction work, with the Scottish Office the
ultimate customer, there must be a chance of write-backs in future years.
Even so, it is questionable whether maintaining a presence in construction
is worth the expense.
If forecast profits before provisions of Pounds 29m last year survive the
auditors' scrutiny, the waste side will have held up better. But waste
management is far from being the recession-proof business touted at the end
of the 1980s. With new government licensing arrangements again postponed,
big landfill operators like Shanks will find it hard to raise prices
immediately. A price earnings ratio close to the market average, even after
the recent de-rating, demands no more nasty shocks on the downside and some
pleasant surprises on the way up.

FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: De La Rue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British consumers wrote 3 per cent fewer cheques in 1992 than the year
before as they made greater use of debit cards. This trend could have proved
an embarrassment for the printer De La Rue, but it remained unperturbed: the
company also specialises in payment systems. This breadth of activity
enabled De La Rue to record a 34 per cent increase in profits last year. Its
banknote business - given a fresh burst of life by former communist
countries issuing new currencies - provides a steady income stream. Its
presence in payment technology, strengthened by the acquisition of Inter
Innovation, gives good growth prospects.
De La Rue's attractions are clear enough and it deservedly stands at a 15
per cent premium to the market. But over the past year, its shares have been
becalmed as investors chase UK recovery stocks. With 90 per cent of its
sales made overseas and a policy of hedging foreign income, De La Rue has
been further disadvantaged in terms of sentiment.
To some extent, De La Rue has also been caught out by the speed of its
progress. Its strong cash flow, better than even it expected, has left it
with net cash of Pounds 170m at the year end, making its Pounds 160m rights
issue of just two years ago appear superfluous. With the bulk of the cash
held in the UK, De La Rue now faces a drag on earnings. The company may make
acquisitions but insists they must not be dilutive. Given current levels of
interest rates that should not be difficult. It may also provide the spur to
return De La Rue to the buy lists.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace's new management is developing a happy knack of delivering
on its promises. The deal to sell its corporate jet business to Raytheon is
just the latest step in BAe's rehabilitation. Indeed it is encouraging that
through a range of deals the company stuck so closely to the development
plans set out by Mr John Cahill shortly after he became chairman. That
corporate jets have been sold now also underlines the new-found strength in
BAe's negotiating position. Last autumn sale talks collapsed when Raytheon
pushed too hard on conditions. The UK's lower exchange rate has increased
the sterling price Raytheon can pay, but BAe's tough stance shows that
assets will not go at fire sale prices.
Of BAe's remaining businesses, the turboprop aircraft operation is likely to
go into a joint venture eventually - possibly with Aerospatiale. A better
tone to the property market may allow disposals which release cash, even
though much of the paper profit has already been taken to offset
rationalisation costs. On a larger scale the valuable Hatfield airfield may
be re-developed as a business centre on the M25 with parking for the busy
executive's corporate jet.
Rover, however, is likely to remain within the group for some time. BAe
still has to manage the net worth of its balance sheet carefully, and Rover
would not fetch anything near book value yet. With the company making market
share gains and a UK car market recovery in prospect, there is little reason
to sell now. BAe's new management may have had its share of luck, but at
least it has ridden it well.

FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Mr Clinton's trim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be little that finance ministers meeting in the OECD can do
except mark their forecasts down. While the OECD is particularly concerned
at the downturn in Europe, it is not getting much help from the US whose
recovery is clearly far from vigorous. Even yesterday's purchasing managers'
index only looks good in the context of a particularly weak April reading.
Given the revised US first quarter growth of only 0.9 per cent, estimates of
growth for the year as a whole may have to be scaled back to between 2 and
2.5 per cent.
It is difficult, though, to square these more modest expectations with
continuing worries about inflation. A recovery led by productivity and
investment should not be inherently inflationary. The effect on unemployment
remains disappointing and, car sales apart, consumer demand is weak.
Doubtless the Federal Reserve would act quickly if the May price data due
next week again show upward pressure on inflation. But the greater risk must
be that the recovery will continue to disappoint.
That suggests a more positive climate for bonds than for equities,
especially now President Clinton appears to be overcoming Senate opposition
to his budget package. That the package is of necessity mildly deflationary
adds to the sense of how little scope there is for concerted international
action to revive the world economy. The temptation for some governments may
be to go for increased protection as an alternative. Or something similar:
like competitive devaluations.

Patrick Nicholls, the newest of the Tories' vice-chairmen, is either a brave
man or a fool.
Just as his fellow Tory MPs are trying to persuade their constituents that
putting value added tax on domestic fuel and increasing national insurance
contributions are not incompatible with the government's election promises,
Nicholls is threatening the party faithful with the unthinkable.
While other backbenchers have been preferring to canvass the options of
extending VAT even further or raising corporation tax, Nicholls, who has
special responsibility for campaigning, has vigorously denied the idea that
any increase in income tax would be 'a shame and embarrassment' given the
government's stated objectives.
'A government which brought the top rate of income tax down from 98 per cent
to 40 per cent need not be embarrassed if for a temporary reason it has to
go up slightly,' he insisted on BBC radio yesterday. Perhaps he needs to
brush up on his campaigning techniques. Despite his vehement denials that
any such course was planned, his interview left the impression that he had
been softening up opinion for the move.

Pity Yasuyuki Tatsumi, a furniture-maker based in western Japan, who seems
to have got rather carried away in his desire to please his royal client.
Masako Owada, who marries her Crown Prince next week, had ordered three
wooden chests from Tatsumi in February. In spite of polite refusals by the
thrifty Owada, Tatsumi insisted on lining the chests with 1,500 sheets of 15
square centimeter gold leaf, and gave a press conference to show off his
handiwork.
But now the chests have been returned to sender and the Owadas have asked
the TV stations, which last week highlighted the gift, to set the record
straight. At Dollars 280,000 apiece, the royal rejects could lead to a bit
of indigestion in the world's second hand chest market.

Who better than Melvyn Bragg, pal of ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock and
presenter of ITV's South Bank Show, to host yesterday's How to Become a
Millionaire book promotion organised by Faber &amp; Faber, the upmarket
publishing house.
Given that Bragg stands to make Pounds 2.2m on his Pounds 32,000 investment
in London Weekend Television, he ought to know a thing or two about playing
games where lots of money is involved.
What did he think of the odds of a Faber contestant picking the one book in
a hundred containing the Pounds 1m check at yesterday's event? Bragg's view
is that the odds on the Faber winner, Nikki Llewelyn, making loads of money,
were better than his own LWT gamble. Even if she failed to win the Pounds 1m
(which she did), she was still guaranteed a Pounds 10,000 prize. 'We would
have lost everything if PolyGram (a rival franchise bidder) had got its act
together,' says an unrepentant Bragg, who admits that he inherited the
gambling spirit from his Dad who rarely goes a day without placing a bet.

Tory ire at the EC 48-hour working week would make the modern party's

legislation protecting the labour force from potentially exploitative
factory owners. Even the arch-Tory Lord Salisbury, as prime minister,
introduced a fair wages resolution - now repealed - to prevent local
authorities contracting out work at miserly levels. It was left to the
laisser-faire Liberals to fret over how such laws would eat away at the
country's industrial competitiveness.

If the eyes of the Dulux Dog, the famous mascot of ICI paints, were going to
go on the blink, it is hard to imagine a worse time. Just as the newly
slimmed down ICI is trying to prove that it is a fit and healthy corporate
animal, it has had to issue a nationwide recall of its 30,000 offspring
before their eyes pop out.
Admittedly, the one-foot-high Dulux Dogs in question are only cuddly toys
which were sold to raise money for charity and, understandably, ICI is
worried that children might swallow any offending eyes which fall out. Even
so, the symbolism of the recall has knocked a bit of the gloss off the
new-look ICI.
After all, chairman Sir Denys Henderson has starred in ICI adverts alongside
the real Dulux dog, and chief executive Ronnie Hampel keeps a life-size
imitation in his office. It sounds as if the cost of renewing the eyes of
the poor dumb mutts will probably exceed the sums raised for charity.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Poland on a detour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 11 months Ms Hanna Suchocka, the Polish prime minister, gave the
impression that Poland had found a new political stability. This was a
tribute to her political skills and the competence of a handful of
ministers, particularly in the finance and privatisation ministries.
Yet the seven-party coalition was always a minority government. It could not
even count on all the 186 votes of its members in the 460-seat lower house.
This was due to the political differences between the two core parties in
the government, Ms Suchocka's Democratic Union and the Liberal Democrats, on
the one hand, and the smaller catholic and peasants' parties, on the other.
The government lost Friday's no-confidence motion because just a handful of
coalition votes was not cast. The initial reaction, written on Ms Suchocka's
face, was dismay. She had repeatedly told parliament that it would be
irresponsible to bring down a government committed to economic reform
without any alternative in sight. Poland, she argued, needs political
stability to persevere with tight fiscal and monetary policies and retain
foreign financial support. At home, Poland must implement a series of
reforms, including a new tax system, bank restructuring and privatisation,
if it is to make its incipient economic recovery sustainable.
Parliament ignored these warnings. In response, President Lech Walesa opted
to dissolve parliament and called on Ms Suchocka to lead a caretaker
government until elections can be held this autumn, probably in September.
Poland faces three or four difficult months. But there are reasonable
grounds for believing that these early elections could turn out to be a
blessing in disguise.
More stable
For a start, Mr Walesa has indicated that he will sign the new electoral
law, passed by parliament shortly after the no-confidence vote, in time for
the elections. The new, German-style electoral barrier means that smaller
parties which fail to obtain 5 per cent of the vote will not gain
representation. This should make it easier to form more stable coalitions.
As important, Mr Walesa signalled his support for the outgoing government's
tough fiscal stance by vetoing a 21,000bn zloty (Pounds 840m) bill for
increased pensions. Parliament had approved the package in the face of
government objections that it would breach the budget deficit limit of 5 per
cent of gross domestic product, which was agreed with the IMF in return for
a Dollars 660m standby agreement.
High rating
Mr Walesa, an intuitive politician, has evidently been impressed by the high
rating given to Ms Suchocka in opinion polls. Apparently, at least 60 per
cent of the electorate understand the need for sacrifices if Poland's
transition to market democracy is to be sustained. These are the people who
have either benefited or see prospects of benefiting from the transition
process. While industrial output has slumped 40 per cent since 1989, they
have also seen an explosion of private business, an internally convertible
currency, full shops and latterly even a recovery of industrial output from
both state and private firms.
Unfortunately, around 40 per cent of the electorate feel excluded. Their
numbers include many favoured by the old regime, like steelworkers and
coalminers, or protected, like farmers, teachers and other public sector
workers. In these groups are those who have suffered most from high
inflation and rising unemployment. Not surprisingly, these people also
resent the wealth flaunted by the newly rich.
This dichotomy is to be found in all the post-communist states. The only way
of dealing with the problem is to combine sustainable economic growth with
high employment and a financeable social safety net. The EC could help by
opening markets. Also beneficial would be a reduction in Poland's Dollars
12.1bn commercial bank debt, which would stimulate greater foreign
investment. But there are no short cuts, as the majority recognise. They
need to maintain support for the parties pledged to continue the reform
which is now showing its first fruits.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Personal View: Search for solution to UK pay puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID METCALF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profound changes have occurred in the British system of pay determination in
the last decade. Despite this, the government has had to create some 3m
unemployed to get wage settlements down. Once unemployment really starts
falling, it is unlikely that Britain will continue to enjoy many nominal
settlements of 3 per cent and less.
Many fewer employees are covered by collective bargaining now than 10 years
ago. Then, nearly three-quarters had their pay set by bargaining. Now that
figure is less than half, and collective bargaining no longer dominates.
Hand-in-hand with this decline, union membership has haemorrhaged, the
closed shop is almost extinct, and, where collective bargaining remains,
almost all employees are now covered by single employer agreements. In
recent years, also, national agreements have been abandoned in a diverse
range of sectors and, simultaneously, the fragmentation of bargaining inside
the company has been moderated: most multi-plant employers now bargain at
company rather than workplace level.
Decentralisation of bargaining towards the organisation level is also taking
place in the public sector.
These alterations all strengthen the link between pay and the performance of
the individual employee and the fortunes of the company. Merit pay, employee
share ownership schemes and profit sharing have all spread rapidly.
Finally, virtually all comparability machinery and protection for the low
paid have been axed.
The government has achieved almost everything it set out to do concerning
Britain's system of pay determination. This has produced important gains in
efficiency.
But the plain fact is that the pay/jobs trade-off has not improved in the
way that free market economists led us to believe that it would. During the
whole of the 1980s the rise in average annual earnings never fell below 7.5
per cent. And between 1983 and 1990 real earnings growth for those in work
was a record high.
It is only in the last couple of years - as unemployment doubled - that the
pay outcomes changed. Pay settlements plummeted. The independent research
body, Industrial Relations Services, puts average settlements at 3.6 per
cent, only half the figure of a year ago.
Higher unemployment meant job losses and falling profits in the private
sector, both of which traditionally lower pay inflation. In engineering, a
staggering 207 settlements out of 346 reported between November and January
were either frozen or deferred to later in the year.
Higher unemployment, coupled with the decline in union presence, has also
led to a huge widening of the pay distribution. Earnings are much more
unequal now than they were in 1960.
Once recovery gets under way and unemployment falls, pay settlements will
surely edge up again. Company profits will rise, skill shortages will bid up
pay and public sector employees will wish to recoup recent real wage losses.
Employers increasingly use pay as a management device to elicit effort,
commitment and teamwork in the company. Earlier this year - in the trough of
the present recession - Imperial Chemical Industries paid its 20,000 manual
workers 14.5 per cent in return for sweeping changes in working practices.
So the need for greater flexibility at work will also lead to higher average
pay rises in the mid-1990s than are being enjoyed at present.
The British pay predicament - how to get low settlements and rapid
employment growth - remains intact. The pay conundrum only appears to have
been solved because of the tragedy of nearly 3m unemployed.
Almost no one would advocate a return to the old corporatist arrangements of
the 1970s. But the Treasury and the Department of Employment must work much
harder to establish a consensus on what pay increase is affordable. This
process should start now. The Seven Wise Men who comment on Treasury
performance might be asked to advise on sensible settlements. The CBI should
then emphasise this advice in its own excellent pay briefing mounted for
members each autumn. The employment department could contribute too. Why not
convene an annual forum involving the largest 50 private sector
organisations to discuss the recommendations of the wise men?
Consensus building involving the social partners will involve some modest
changes to Britain's institutions and pay processes. But without it,
inflation will inevitably return.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Leading Article: For whom the motorway tolls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, Britain's transport secretary, should be congratulated
for his nerve. Only a day after narrowly avoiding a House of Commons defeat
over railway privatisation, he proposed last Wednesday another potential
political hot potato - motorway charging.
Although the idea has some theoretical appeal, Mr MacGregor will have to
work hard to make it politically acceptable. He also has yet to make a
convincing case that motorway tolls are an economically sensible way to
raise more money from motorists compared with the much simpler alternative
of putting up fuel taxes - an option which receives barely a mention in his
discussion paper.
The attraction of motorway charging is twofold. First, it could lead to a
more efficient allocation of resources within the economy. So long as roads
are free at the point of use, motorists will have an artificial incentive to
drive rather than using railways or not travelling at all. It may also be
right to impose higher charges on road-users to take account of the full
costs to the community of motoring, which include congestion, noise and
pollution as well as building and maintaining roads.
Second, unless motorways can produce an extra stream of income, the
government argues that public-spending constraints will prevent new roads
being built as quickly as desirable. Similarly, without a source of income,
it will be difficult to privatise the motorways or franchise parts of the
network to private sector companies.
But annual motorway permits and electronic tolls - the methods of charging
currently favoured by the government - have drawbacks. It is hard to see any
merit in permits, since motorways would still be free at the point of use
and so nothing would be done to promote a more efficient allocation of
resources.
More pollution
There are also snags with electronic tolls. They would distort road usage
since only motorways would be covered. As a result, traffic would be
diverted on to secondary roads bringing more noise, pollution and accidents
to Britain's towns and villages. Even with a charge of 1.5p per mile - which
would only raise Pounds 700m a year - the government estimates 10 per cent
of traffic would be diverted off motorways. There could also be substantial
costs in building and operating an electronic toll system, although Mr
MacGregor's paper makes no attempt to quantify them.
Moreover, the government has yet to make a case that congestion is a
widespread problem throughout the motorway system. Britain does have a road
congestion problem, but it is most acute in city centres - particularly
London. The case for urban road-pricing is strong, but is not dealt with in
this week's discussion document.
Extra money
Increasing fuel taxes would face none of the drawbacks of motorway tolls.
There would be no traffic diversion since taxes would cover all roads, not
just motorways. Moreover, collection costs would be minimal given that there
is already a system in place.
The main snag with higher fuel taxes from the government's perspective is
that they would not obviously help promote the second objective of preparing
the motorways for privatisation. The danger is that the extra money would be
grabbed by the Treasury to finance the general budget deficit instead of
road-building. But this is a danger also faced by motorway tolls. And, if it
can be solved by establishing a separate fund far from the Treasury's
clutches, it is not obvious that the same could not be done for a proportion
of fuel taxes.
Moreover, the government has yet to produce persuasive arguments that there
will be substantial efficiency gains from privatising motorways. The private
sector already builds and maintains the roads under contract. There may well
be benefits in redrawing such contracts so that private operators bear more
of the risk. There could also be advantages in hiving off the motorway
network into a public corporation separate from the Department of Transport.
But neither move would require an elaborate system of motorway tolls.
To be fair, the government's proposals are not set in stone but are designed
to launch a 'wide, informed and vigorous public debate'. Good.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Hard pedalling on the comeback trail: The Big Three US
carmakers are clawing back market share from the Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honda, the car company which for years symbolised the Japanese threat to
America's automotive industry, is suffering a dismal year in the US.
Chrysler, which used to be regarded as the weakest of Detroit's Big Three
vehicle manufacturers, is enjoying an extremely successful one.
The shift in fortunes underscores a significant change in the dynamics of
the US automobile market: Detroit, having spent more than a decade losing
ground to seemingly invincible Japanese competitors, is starting to claw
back market share. It still has a long way to go.
General Motors, the biggest US company, is restructuring, but it is still
extremely inefficient compared with its rivals. And the US revival is due in
no small measure to special factors, which could prove temporary. One of the
most important is the strength of the Japanese yen, which has made most
American cars substantially cheaper than their Japanese rivals.
Yet there is probably greater optimism in Detroit now than at any time since
the early 1980s, when the Japanese began capturing a larger and larger slice
of US vehicle sales by manufacturing at plants in the US - their so-called
'transplant' factories - as well as exporting from Japan.
Mr David Cole, a motor industry specialist at the University of Michigan,
says the American industry is improving a lot faster than many experts had
forecast. 'It's like a chemical reaction. You put in nine ingredients and
nothing happens. You add a tenth and there's an explosion.
'The idea of the 1980s - that it was just a matter of time before the
Japanese conquered the world - may not be accurate,' he adds.
Take Honda, for example. It is only Japan's fourth-largest vehicle
manufacturer, but it has occupied a particularly important position in the
US since 1982, when it became the first Japanese company to set up a US
manufacturing operation.
That, and the reputation of its cars for quality and fuel efficiency,
allowed it to oust Chrysler in 1991 from its long-time position as the
third-largest selling car company in America.
Now, however, Honda's share of the US car market has shrunk from 9.8 per
cent in 1991 to 7.5 per cent in the first four months of this year. Its
ageing Accord mid-sized vehicle, which for three years until last autumn was
the top selling car in America, is now only the ninth most popular, and
Honda has begun offering discounts to dealers to boost sales.
To cap it all, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating
allegations that some Honda dealers paid bribes to Honda company employees
in the 1980s to win franchises and to secure adequate supplies of the
company's vehicles.
Honda is still an important force in the US market, with a core of loyal
customers, and its sales may revive in the autumn when it brings out a
remodelled and more powerful version of the Accord. But the current
difficulties have tarnished its once golden aura.
Compare that with Chrysler, which just three years ago seemed in such dire
straits - financially stretched, lacking strong new products - that many
analysts believed it could not long survive as an independent company.
But it has staged an extraordinary comeback, thanks to fundamental changes
in the way it develops new vehicles, a rigorous clampdown on costs and, most
important, a range of exciting new models.
Its share of the car market has soared from 7.9 per cent in the first four
months of 1992 to 10.3 per cent this year, thanks mainly to its innovatively
designed, mid-sized 'LH' vehicles - the Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision and
Dodge Intrepid.
The LH range seems to be winning over a substantial number of motorists who
previously bought foreign cars. It is also selling well in one of the most
crucial segments of the market - among the youngish, fashion-conscious, more
affluent buyers, who deserted the Big Three in droves in the 1980s.
Chrysler provides the most startling example of Detroit's revival, but Ford
has also been increasing its market share, and even General Motors, while
still losing share, can point to a number of successes that offer rays of
hope for the future.
For example, Saturn, the small car project GM began in the 1980s to try to
show that America could compete using the most modern manufacturing and
sales methods, is producing one of the country's hottest selling vehicles,
with a particularly high reputation for quality.
Nor is Honda the only Japanese manufacturer to suffer a setback in sales.
The market shares of Toyota and Mazda are also down significantly this year,
although Nissan, long a laggard in the US market, has bucked the trend with
a sharp rise in share, thanks to a boldly designed and cheaply priced new
car, the Altima.
The upshot is that the Big Three's car market share rose from 65 per cent to
67.7 per cent in the first four months of this year, while sales of Japanese
branded vehicles dropped from 29.6 per cent to 27.2 per cent.
Adding in light trucks, the Japanese total is down from 24.3 per cent to
21.9 per cent, with the Big Three up from 72.2 to 74.9 per cent. Chrysler
and Ford have been much more adept than their rivals at designing hit
vehicles in the fast-growing markets for mini-vans and sports utility
vehicles, which are classified as trucks.
Why the change? First, the Americans have learnt an immense amount from the
Japanese about speedy vehicle development, 'lean' or super-efficient
manufacturing techniques, and the need to build the highest quality into
their products.
Chrysler, for example, radically changed the way it operates after studying
Honda. It set up close links with suppliers, which are brought into
discussions early in the development of a new vehicle, and it created new
teams, bringing together disciplines like engineering and design, to work
together on the development of models.
Japanese vehicles still tend to lead American ones in quality surveys:
Toyota, Nissan and Honda occupied 10 of the top 12 slots in a study of
vehicle quality released last week by J D Power &amp; Associates, a consultancy
firm.
But the quality gap between US and Japanese companies has narrowed to the
point where consumers are prepared to give greater weight to other factors,
such as styling, price and dealer service.
And on price the Americans are at present far more competitive. The Japanese
manufacturers have repeatedly raised prices in recent months to offset the
appreciating yen, which has risen 16 1/2 per cent against the dollar since
the start of the year.
In the past, strong financial results at home allowed the Japanese to be
more flexible with US prices, but the sharp downturn in their domestic
market has eliminated that luxury. Japanese cars are now on average Dollars
2,300 more expensive than American equivalents.
At the same time, President Bill Clinton's tough trade rhetoric, and the
problems at General Motors, may have encouraged the Japanese to temper their
previously aggressive expansion in the US - at least for the time being.
They will not want to antagonise Democrat Congressmen, who are threatening
to press for the current 25 per cent import duty on trucks to be extended to
all sports utility vehicles and mini-vans.
None of this means that US auto makers can afford any complacency. Trade and
currency factors can change quickly, and a recovering Japanese economy will
eventually give the Asian companies a firmer financial footing. The
Americans, for all their improvements, still suffer some big disadvantages
relative to the Japanese transplants. For example, observers reckon that
they have to pay on average Dollars 600 to Dollars 700 a vehicle more for
workers' health insurance than the transplants, with their younger labour
force.
The US companies also face delicate negotiations in the next few months with
the United Auto Workers' union over a new labour contract, which is likely
to focus on health costs and companies' freedom to cut jobs. The
transplants, by contrast, are generally non-union shops with more flexible
labour forces.
Above all, General Motors' new management team still has a long way to go in
its battle to cut costs, produce cars Americans want to buy, and earn a
reasonable return on its capital.
But at the very least the market upheavals of the past few months have
taught Detroit that it can be a winner, and that the Japanese are by no
means invincible. There might be an important lesson here for the Europeans.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Soft bark and not much of a bite / Examining the growing
debate over the effectiveness and priorities of the ILO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 163-nation International Labour Organisation, whose three-week annual
conference begins in Geneva today, has yet to find a firm foothold in the
post cold-war world.
Created by western governments, employers and unions in 1919 to demonstrate
the caring face of capitalism, in response to the newly formed 'workers'
state' of Soviet Russia, its aims include full and productive employment, a
'minimum living wage', tripartism and collective bargaining, and basic
social protection.
Yet today, as the latest ILO World Labour Report indicates, unemployment and
poverty are increasing, child labour remains a scourge, and up to 33m
workers are in forced labour, such as debt bondage where workers are trapped
by debt to an employer. Health and safety conditions remain dismal in much
of the world, as last month's fire in a Bangkok toy factory, in which more
than 200 workers were killed, made tragically clear. In the western
industrialised countries, trade union membership is declining and tripartism
is on the retreat.
Critics from both left and right question the ILO's priorities,
effectiveness and, in particular, the role of international labour
standards. 'The machine churning out conventions has gone mad,' says one
western government official. 'There's no point in adopting more and more
detailed conventions if they have no effect on labour conditions.'
The ILO's 173 conventions and 180 recommendations cover basic human and
worker rights - freedom of association, elimination of child labour and
forced labour, non-discrimination - as well as detailed norms on health and
safety, social security and wage determination. This year's annual
conference is considering standards on prevention of serious industrial
accidents and on protection of part-time workers.
But governments have no obligation to ratify conventions and there are no
penalties attached to breaching them. Egregious violations of the most basic
human rights - such as the murder or jailing of trade unionists - are
punished by no more than a public rebuke. The ILO's worst sanction is the
so-called 'special paragraph', which singles out the country - last year,
Sudan - for the attention of the annual conference.
The British government has been criticised eight times for violating the
ILO's freedom of association convention, notably for its ban on unions at
the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham. Mr Marcello
Malentacchi, general secretary of the International Metalworkers'
Federation, warned in a speech last April that the ILO was in danger of
being marginalised.
In addition, the ILO, which employs 1,800 people and has an annual budget of
nearly Dollars 300m, has come under fire for its sluggish bureaucracy and
cumbersome tripartite structure, in which employers and unions as well as
governments are represented. Some argue that, as a result, the ILO has been
slow to respond effectively to the globalisation of the world economy and
changing patterns of employment.
There is also concern that the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank have been able to seize the initiative on labour issues in developing
nations and in eastern Europe, often with scant regard for ILO principles of
social justice, democracy and human rights.
The ILO is now embroiled in an important debate on its direction. The
employers' side wants the ILO to place less emphasis on standard-setting,
which it argues can hamper job creation, and pay more attention to promoting
employment. Mr Jean-Jacques Oechslin, chairman of the employers' group, says
the ILO should be helping with training programmes and encouraging improved
labour mobility. 'The biggest problem in industrialised and developing
countries is employment,' he says. 'This can't be tackled by voting for
conventions. It has to be done by action in the field.'
Mr Eddy Laurijssen, director of the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions and secretary of the workers' group in the ILO, says that
growing joblessness has often coincided with falling employment standards.
He says the ILO should be pushing social issues to the top of the
international agenda, especially with the IMF and World Bank, and making
standards more effective.
Mr Michel Hansenne, the ILO's Belgian director-general, who was last week
re-elected for a second five-year term, says standards are the backbone of
the organisation and must remain so. He concedes, however, that with the
exception of the 15 or so core human rights standards, such as freedom of
association, these need not always take the form of international
conventions.
He also defends the ILO's preference for measured disapproval of rule
breaches and behind-the-scenes persuasion. 'I don't think it would be wise
to transform ourselves into a public accuser,' he says. Countries would lose
confidence in the ILO and might prefer to denounce conventions rather than
be pilloried for breaches of them.
Nevertheless, critics compare the organisation's quietly launched 'global
offensive' against child labour, which may affect 100m to 200m children
worldwide, with the high-profile campaign by Unicef, the UN children's fund,
for a consumer boycott of carpets made by children.
In the US, trade preferences can be withdrawn from countries which abuse
worker rights and there are moves in Congress to ban all imports of goods
made by children. The workers' group in the ILO wants the organisation to
back a 'social clause' in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which
would permit trading partners to impose trade sanctions on countries which
exploit their workers and thereby gain competitive advantage.
Mr Hansenne points out that from the start the ILO's role was to combat
'social dumping' by setting international norms but says the Gatt social
clause debate is in danger of confusing two different issues.
The first, of central ILO concern, is whether a new mechanism is needed to
enforce basic human rights standards worldwide. Such a social clause in the
Gatt would include, for example, the ILO's core standards (such as freedom
of association and elimination of forced labour) that embody universally
accepted fundamental human rights.
The second is what international fair competition rules there should be in
an open trading system, and the extent to which these should cover labour
conditions such as minimum wages or social security protection. This debate,
while important, does not relate to enforcement of ILO norms, says Mr
Hansenne.
Meanwhile, the ILO has already embarked on reorganisation to try to improve
its effectiveness. Technical assistance is to be tied more directly to the
promotion of standards. And the organisation is moving 'closer to the
customer' with its so-called 'active partnership' policy. This seeks to
promote agreements among governments, unions and employers on priorities for
labour and social policies and technical assistance in each country.
In a linked move, the first of 14 regional teams has been set up in Budapest
to help the ILO cope with burgeoning demands from central and eastern
European countries. These demands range from assistance in setting up
tripartite industrial relations structures, to helping establish labour
exchange networks and drafting social security legislation.
The debate on the organisation's future will culminate next year when the
ILO celebrates its 75th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the
Declaration of Philadelphia, which elaborated its constitution. By the time
of the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, Mr Hansenne hopes a
rejuvenated ILO will show the way towards a 'new world order' which can
marry economic development with respect for human rights. But to exert
greater influence on governments and employers, the ILO will have to define
its role more clearly and be prepared to make its voice heard.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Third time lucky: Plans to exempt small companies from
audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Bumpas, managing director of Fabricators Steel Supply, a small
steel supplier in Essex, has a simple attitude to the UK law requiring
annual audits: 'It is of no benefit to us.'
If a radical consultation paper from the Department of Trade and Industry
becomes law, the requirement could disappear. The paper calls for the
removal of the statutory annual audit for about 250,000-300,000 companies
with an annual turnover below Pounds 37,600 - the threshold for paying
value-added tax.
Under the DTI proposals, company directors would remain responsible for
maintaining financial records and filing annual accounts. But the
verification of an external auditor would either be eliminated, or replaced
by a 'compilation report' requiring less scrutiny from accountants: in
short, a statement that the figures comply with the requirements of UK
company law. Shareholders would have unanimously to approve any decision to
drop the audit.
The DTI has come under increasing pressure to lift the annual burden from
small companies largely because of the costs to business and to accountants,
who have to comply with a new audit regulation regime. Critics allege that
the statutory audit is expensive and time-consuming. A study by Manchester
University suggests the audit fee is 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent of turnover
for small companies.
Under laws dating from the early 1900s, Britain's 1.1m limited liability
companies - in which creditors can lay claim only to the assets of the
business and not to the personal assets of the directors - must produce
annual audited accounts.
An independent accountant, acting on behalf of the shareholders, is required
to verify that the accounts prepared by the directors present a 'true and
fair view' of the company's financial position. However, the same auditing
requirements apply to the largest quoted company and the smallest business.
Mr Bumpas's company falls into this latter category. Like most small company
owners, Mr Bumpas is also the principal shareholder, and his auditor is also
his book-keeper. So he hires his auditor to protect him (as a shareholder),
and verify the accounts that he (as a director) has prepared in conjunction
with his accountant (in his role as book-keeper). Despite business drying up
in the recession, Mr Bumpas is still required to have an annual audit. 'I am
paying my accountant Pounds 900 for nothing,' he says.
That view is shared by Mr Neil Hamper, Mr Bumpas's accountant. 'It is a
nonsense,' he says. 'I would feel much happier if I was acting just as a
small business adviser.'
Such criticism helps explain why the abolition of the audit of smaller
companies has been examined by the DTI twice before in the past decade. But
on both occasions ministers rejected reform, in the face of opposition from
bodies such as the Inland Revenue, banks and credit-rating agencies, which
opposed any change that might be seen to affect the credibility of financial
information.
However, a consensus seems to be emerging between some former opponents of
change. The Inland Revenue says it has been consulted by the DTI over the
proposals and its senior officials see the need to ease the burden on small
business.
The British Bankers' Association has also been won over by the reform
argument. 'We can see the need to try to lift the requirement (for a
statutory audit),' it said. 'We welcome it.' Banks, like the Inland Revenue,
have more leverage over companies and can request detailed information about
their financial position as a condition for loans.
Professional accountancy bodies have been split over reform in the past, but
even the previously hostile Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
admits that the smallest company would benefit more from spending money on
business advice and book-keeping than on annual audits.
Pressure from the DTI, combined with the low exemption level, and the belief
that small companies would still require the services of an accountant, have
persuaded the association to change its position. Mr David Bishop, the
outgoing Acca president, says: 'It seems a sensible attempt at reducing
bureaucracy and lessening the hassle for the accountants operating in the
market.'
Support for reform has always come from business itself. Some view the DTI
plans as not far-reaching enough. Mr Tony Miller, an accountant who is
financial affairs chairman for the National Federation of Self-Employed and
Small Businesses, says: 'This is a step in the right direction but the plans
are still far too restrictive.' The Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, for instance, calls for exemption for companies with a
turnover below Pounds 300,000.
Some strong opposition remains. Mr Terry Robinson, a vice-president of the
Institute of Credit Management, warns that credit-rating agencies would
resist the changes. He argues that, without an audit, companies' figures
would be less reliable, thus making an assessment of credit-worthiness more
difficult or, in some cases, impossible. This in turn would make it more
difficult for small companies to raise loans. 'This will work against the
best interests of small companies,' he says.
Several industry observers believe that removing the need for scrutiny of
accounts by an independent accountant could give rise to greater risk of
fraud. The DTI devotes just a paragraph in its document on the likelihood of
fraud, which claims that this danger is minimal in small companies. It adds
that exemption from audit would not be permitted for small companies that
are part of a larger group which could be used to hide illegal financial
transactions.
With most traditional objectors now sympathetic to reform, regulations to
raise the threshold required for an annual audit could be drafted within 12
months. Ironically, that would leave Mr Bumpas's company exempt just at the
point when business could pick up and his turnover rise to the point where
he would once more require an audit.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Road tolls should release funds for investment in
railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HOWELL MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Both a return to private railway operation and the tolling of motorways
make sense as component parts of a new transport strategy, but the transport
policymakers seem badly confused about how to fit them together.
Ministers tell us that the tolls are needed to provide extra resources for
road building. Meanwhile the railway infrastructure continues to be denied
the extra capital required for a real renaissance, with all the talk of
finance for railway expansion (if any) coming from higher fares being
charged by private operators.
Such a prospect will make rail travel still more unattractive vis-a-vis
roads, and it has already compelled the government to promise concessionary
fare protection and tight fare regulation under pressure from understandably
nervous backbenchers.
This whole policy sequence needs to be put into reverse. Railway
privatisation should be an opportunity to drive down sharply the cost of
rail and freight travel.
This means investing in new rail infrastructure on criteria comparable to
those used for roads. This in turn would begin creating the business
conditions for the new franchisees in which much higher and more competitive
rail services could be delivered, and expanded on both new and disused
lines. Then and only then will the pressure on roads start easing.
The new money raised by motorway tolls should release funds for this benign
and coherent purpose - not for accommodating still more refugee traffic from
ever more expensive railways.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Lloyd's Names should not have to bear burden of
losses twice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL J WADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Mr Gurney's letter (May 27) in relation to Lloyd's,
the fundamental point, with which he seems to agree, is that a growing and
profitable Lloyd's market is in everyone's best interest.
However, before Mr Gurney pursues his misjudged demand for an extraordinary
general meeting of members (quite besides the unnecessary expense and
effort, as there is an annual general meeting already scheduled for June 22)
I hope that he would consider these two important points.
First, a suggestion that 25 per cent of future profits earned by corporate
Names should be 'taxed' by the Society of Lloyd's and credited to its 1980s
membership would almost certainly deter any new corporate capital entering
the market. It has already been suggested that a levy of 1.5 per cent on
capacity be made on corporate Names which, if the profits are 10 per cent on
capacity, levies a 15 per cent charge on profits. In addition, Lloyd's
itself is proposing a bidding system for capacity on top of this charge the
combination of which brings into question whether new capital is better
supplied to Lloyd's syndicates or to other London insurance entities.
Second, before seeking to demand a proportion of future profits, both Mr
Gurney and Lloyd's should understand that some proportion of this 'corporate
capital' will be supplied by individuals who, like myself, have already
suffered those same very heavy personal underwriting losses but who might
choose to underwrite in future through an incorporated Name route - why,
then, should that category of incorporated Name have to bear such a heavy
burden twice?

FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Czech trade minister seeks fairer access to
Community markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VLADIMIR DLOUHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When Czechoslovakia - now the Czech Republic and Slovakia - escaped
from communism at the end of 1989, it faced an enormous task of political
and economic transformation. Now, after more than three years, it is clear
that the Czech Republic has performed better than expected. Despite the
dissolution of the federation and the consequential setbacks, macroeconomic
stability prevails and the privatisation process is progressing
satisfactorily. All this is the result of enlightened economic reform
combined with political commitment.
Nobody denies, however, that there are many challenges and obstacles yet to
be overcome.
It is accepted that the Czech Republic is not yet ready for full EC
membership; clearly, this will take some time. But it is starting to appear
that the Czech nation may be institutionally and economically prepared for
membership sooner than the EC is prepared to receive it. Although time is
not the biggest issue, the real problem appears to be the Community policy
in the interim period.
The real issue is trade. The Association Agreement improved substantially
the access of Czech goods to EC markets, although in recent months a
substantial slow-down is being observed. It is noted that sensitive
commodities, such as agricultural products, steel and textiles, remain
serious obstacles.
The EC and others should accept as a reality that there are sensitive
commodities where countries in central Europe have short-term comparative
advantages and that such commodities are neither subsidised nor dumped.
Economic recovery is simply stifled if fair trading access is not assured,
for trading is really the only long-term effective aid. Professor Anne
Kruger, ex-World Bank, articulates this very conflict in her excellent,
recently published book, Economic Policies at Cross Purposes: United States
and Developing Countries.
Ready access to neighbouring markets for the Czech Republic is becoming the
imperative for the priming of economic growth while at the same time one of
its greatest impediments.
With respect, the Community will probably need its own structural and
economic reforms, for this cannot be a one-sided process left solely to the
post-communist economies. It may be, of course, that we all need further
social and political reform as well, including changes in perception of the
political cycle. In particular, pampered pressure groups, such as farmers,
miners, steelworkers and others, should not be so attentively heeded just
because of pending elections in this or that country.
A profound change in economic policies, abandoning what are sometimes
disastrous subsidies, will finally release all of us from this vicious
circle of short-term political expediency. This crippling economic-political
cycle, in which the west, in particular, now finds itself, will simply have
to be broken before further progress for Europe as a whole can be achieved.
Vladimir Dlouhy,
minister for industry and trade,
The Czech Republic

FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Computer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M E R ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was encouraged to read ('Dispute over future of stock dealing
system', May 29/30) that the Stock Exchange is considering a computer system
which would eliminate the need for marketmaking.
At present, marketmakers appear to believe it is acceptable to charge wide
bid-offer spreads on securities such as penny shares and warrants, arguing
that they can't make a profit on a relatively large variety of low-volume
transactions. Perhaps a computer can make a profit in such a situation?

FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: Much ventured, a fairly small amount gained: A mixed
mini-season of mini-operas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As they say, 'Nothing ventured ..'; but for all the good intentions of the
Garden Venture, it is doubtful just what the gains amount to in hard
operatic currency. This is its third mini-season of commissioned
mini-operas, three in each of two alternating programmes at the Riverside
Studios. With generally high standards of singing, direction and design, and
polished accompaniment by the Endymion Ensemble, every piece got a good run
for its money. Yet only one 'opera' in each programme, by my reckoning,
scored a plausible success in its own terms.
A third was dry and neat, but slight - one felt no inclination to hear it
again; two others were hobbled by operatic miscalculations, and the sixth
was ridiculous. For so much devoted and costly labour, that seemed a meagre
result. What principles guide the Venture's commissions? (There is an
evident bias toward 'fringe' music, some way outside the tougher centre.)
Once commissioned, are the composers left fancy-free to pursue duff ideas?
Of the four also-ran entries, none would imaginably command anything more
than a small, specialised audience: did anybody think that mattered?
Brief reports, in descending order of admiration: - Edward Kemp supplied the
tall tale (funny, touching, at once down-to-earth and visionary) for Geoff
Westley's Travels in the Arctic Circle, about a disillusioned man who
decides to abandon everything and walk alone to the North Pole. Westley's
flamboyantly lush piano-and-strings score, unabashed '30s English-Romantic
with Hollywood echoes, feigns total ignorance of any musical development
since then. But it is also expertly paced and varied, sets the words
impeccably, presses the right expressive buttons in all the right places and
was hugely lucky in Gwion Thomas as its protagonist - bluff and subtle, with
the charisma of a bemused, chastened Bruce Willis.
As Travels was the saving hit of Programme A, so was The Wheel in Programme
B. Felicity Hayes-McCoy's libretto, a caprice about macho hero-figures in
far-flung cultures, might have seemed too precious, had not the Bolivian
composer Agustn Fernandez found so much lithe muscle for it. With prominent
accordion and guitar, the music is springy, pungent and original within an
unmistakably Latin-American idiom, for all its artful ethnic borrowings.
Wilfred Judd's whole production gleamed: bright costumes and props by
Claudia Mayer, virtuoso lighting by Ace McCarron, the vital 'movement'
(fights, struts, poses) devised by Amanda Demetriou - no doubt Stephen
Austin's lusty, stupid Hero owed his Toshiro Mifune airs to her. Fiona
Rose's eternal object-of-heroic-desire was knowing, seductive and delectably
sung; in their multiple roles Martin Lindsay and Jonathan Peter Kenny were
just as clever.
Graham Fitkin chose to make a minimal operatic sketch of Paul Auster's
novella Ghosts (librettised by Walter Donohue), in which White hires Blue, a
low-budget private eye, to keep perpetual, pointless watch on Black. The
denouement falls somewhere between Kafka and O Henry. Nearly all Auster's
sedulously flat urban detail is stripped away, leaving only an abstract
fable which Fitkin has set in a jaunty post-minimalist vein - like very
dilute Michael Torke. It just about works.
In Four Figures with Harlequin, the composer-librettist Errolyn Wallen adds
amiable, pop-oriented music to what the programme-book told us was 'a
journey into the theatre of the subconscious where a lost boy searches to be
born'. There was a boy, not a foetus but a stock pre-adolescent, and three
other stereotypes: a self-absorbed Mother, a spoken Politician ('I am a Man
of the State') and a raddled Fellini monstress. Though their words were
clear enough, the dramatic sense remained opaque, the music
catch-as-catch-can and exiguous.
In Geoffrey Alvarez's The European Story, we lost too much of Ruth
Fainlight's poetic text ('a young woman writer confronts the archetypes of
European consciousness') to overlapping voices to discover what it was meant
to be about, though timeless folktale themes surfaced en passant. Musically,
the Alvarez score was drawn tauter than most of the others here; but just on
that account, its impact was too contrived to suggest the intended depth of
feeling.
Luke Stoneham's Arms for the Maid exposed a Russian counter-tenor (Slava
Kagan-Paley, brilliantly flexible) in a corn-silk wig and little else as
Joan of Arc: warbling away in endless melismata, arms writhing like Rider
Haggard's 'She' at the point of immolation. He/She was attended by vamping
maidens a la Theda Bara (Kate Flowers and Jeannie Marsh did their melodious
best, as also in The European Story).
At bottom Stoneham's score is quite austere (mostly chaconne-like, upon a
stern tonal basis), and insofar as Karen Whiteson's text was discernible it
sounded like plain historical narrative. For all that one could tell, the
ultra-camp but ill-focused Bailey production appeared to be her own,
ludicrously tacky idea.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: A Victorian viewer tunes in - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To return to regular viewing after a break of several weeks spent reading
books and listening to music in a house without a television set is to feel
a little like a stern Victorian. Why are these television people behaving in
such a manic fashion? Whence these false grins? Why the obsession with
speed? If the aim is to entertain, why this fixation upon the criminal, the
violent, and the distastefully abnormal? Do the people who make these
programmes believe their audience consists exclusively of morons? Why don't
they calm down, pipe down, give the monotonous disco drumbeat a rest (having
ruined so much sport it is now creeping into serious current affairs) and
stop the incessant high-pressure trailers?
The week began with an edition of Horizon called 'Wot U Lookin At?' which
was said to be the most common phrase immediately preceding an outbreak of
violence. We were treated once again to the old nature/nurture debate: are
people born with criminal tendencies or is their upbringing responsible?
Predictably enough the programme itself appeared to side with the
politically correct nurture faction and the last line of the script -
'Should we look to the structure of society and not to the structure of our
brains for the solution?' - came out sounding more like a statement than a
question. When a black man in the US was shown vehemently opposing any
statistical analysis of race and crime nobody even went so far as to ask
whether it was the facts he feared or their misinterpretation.
Criminality is no doubt a subject of concern to many, yet it seems clear
that fear of being the victim of violent crime, especially among the
elderly, is absurdly disproportionate to the real risk - thanks largely to
television. Do broadcasters never look across their own schedules and wonder
at their perpetual obsession with the criminal? On the same night as Horizon
BBC2 screened a pastiche game show called It's A Stitch-Up, which
successfully highlighted some of the iniquities of British justice, and a
repeat episode of the prison comedy Porridge. ITV showed the real crime game
show Cluedo and an unsuccessful American cop-show pilot, Mr Inside/Mr
Outside. Channel 4 repeated the excellent ITV drama Hard Shoulder, about
stolen fire extinguishers, blackmail and thuggery.
On BBC1, in addition to an episode of the American crime series Cagney And
Lacey, there was a Panorama devoted to 'The Beast Of Corleone', Mafia boss
Salvatore Riina. Apart from a nastily glamorised reconstruction of a murder,
with natty blue back-lighting, this was one of the better Mafia programmes,
but even if they were working for an Italian audience British broadcasters
would be paying undue attention to this subject. In the hill villages of
Umbria they do talk about organised crime, but they talk much more about the
weather, the vines, and football.
Next night, presumably in case we had missed the previous two dozen, 40
Minutes (BBC2) treated us to yet another prison documentary about the mind
of the psychopath. Perhaps I am taking my social obligations too lightly,
but this programme told me more about Al's rough, rude, violent proclivities
than I wished to know. I am probably lacking in sympathy for transexuals and
transvestites, too, because I feel as though I have seen enough programmes
about these saddening people to last me a lifetime. In part this is a result
of attending international television festivals where such programmes are a
great favourite, but even without leaving Britain it is quite easy to have
seen more programmes about these people than their tiny numbers and tinier
significance in the grand scheme of things can possibly justify.
Which is not to say that Under The Sun: Boys From Brazil (BBC2) was a bad
programme; on the contrary it was well made and moderately revealing.
However, the programme that is still missing is the one that explains why
South Americans with silicone breasts and hips, lots of lipstick, stockings,
suspenders, and penises have had such remarkable success working as
prostitutes in Paris and Rome during the last 10 years. That might tell us
more about the generality of men (and as much, or more perhaps, about modern
women) but making such a documentary would be much harder work, of course,
because there are fewer exhibitionists among punters than among
transvestites.
At least these programmes were all reasonably long and hefty and assumed a
degree of intelligence in the viewer. Elsewhere it is striking to notice,
coming back to television after a break, how often we are treated as
complete nitwits. It is not simply that broadcasters are busy turning the
'three minute culture' myth into a self-fulfilling prophecy by making
shorter and shorter programmes or items, it is also the attitude of the
presenters. BBC2's sequence of item-ettes, Nightshift was a prime example,
so bad it was hilarious.
In the past, live coverage from night-sight cameras designed to show the
activities of foxes or badgers has disappointed when the animals failed to
co-operate. For Nightshift the BBC tried to avoid that by setting up several
cameras in different places, but this proved far from infallible. However,
instead of accepting this and admitting it, the presenters, especially the
chief female presenter seated at a farmhouse table, attempted to disguise
the lack of interest with gushing enthusiasm. The more murky and banal the
forthcoming pictures, the more burblingly intense her introductions became.
Similarly wrong-headed is so much of ITV's sports coverage. Increasingly
this brings to mind supermarket sales of hamburgers where it is not the meat
that counts but the packaging. It is bad enough that, having bought the
rights to the Lions' tour of New Zealand, ITV should shoe-horn a match as
magnificent as that against the Maoris into an 80-minute programme which was
also packed with several commercial breaks and another entire match. Far
worse was the agonising waste of time as we were subjected to a travelogue
about totem poles and antipodean scenery. To find, having got past such
packaging, that even then we were not to enjoy the match properly but merely
to be given bite-sized rugby 'Mc-nuggets', with every try repeated three
times, was appalling. Once again the attitude is that the poor, dim, viewer
cannot be expected to survive a whole rugby match: he must be babied along
with bite-sized spoonsful of pap.
So, was there not a single programme in the week worth watching? Naturally
there were several. Channel 4's adult American comedy series Dream On (adult
by television's standards, anyway) was as funny as usual. In its repeat run
of 10 x 10 BBC2 showed a jewel of a film called 'Beigels Already' about a
famous all-night baker in London. This week's episode in Edgar Reitz's
account of Germany in the 1960s, Die Zweite Heimat, was less impressive than
some, yet still engrossing. On the same night the same channel (BBC2)
screened a programme which seriously considered British party politics
outside a general election and outside a 'balanced' series: in Fight Again
Roy Hattersley discussed Labour's fortunes with other supporters of the
party. Above all there was Tom Bower's account of the life of Tiny Rowland
in BBC1's Inside Story, a remarkable programme in which Bower managed to
persuade a succession of former Lonrho directors and employees to blow the
gaff on film.
Perhaps the lesson that has to be re-learned is that, unlike print or music,
television is a medium that shovels everything into your house, the good and
the bad, the condescending and the more demanding. Consequently much more
discrimination is needed than with the older communications media.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: Kraft at the South Bank - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnus Lindberg deserves every moment of the attention currently being paid
to him in London. This young (b. 1958) Finn is a composer with bags of
individual imagination, energy and - at times - plain cheek, and he has the
resources to carry through even the wildest of his musical ideas. Last
week's short spell of South Bank concerts devoted to his music culminated,
on Saturday evening, with perhaps the wildest idea so far: Kraft, given its
British premiere by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Esa-Pekka Salonen (a
longtime Lindberg collaborator and champion).
This piece has developed a considerable and rather notorious reputation
since its Helsinki premiere in 1985. One heard and saw why: Kraft is a
Happening, a jeu d'esprit with a rude, rebellious flavour. Lindberg,
originally commissioned by the Helsinki Festival to produce a concerto for
piano instead took the opportunity to martial vast orchestral forces,
disperse them over a large hall, and at times set them (musically) at each
others' throats.
On the surface the piece consists of 45 minutes of drum-bangs, gong-crashes,
and fierce brayings from brass-groups forming and re-forming at different
points of the Festival Hall, interspersed with surreally placed quiet solos.
A spirit of choreographed chaos is typified by the group of seven young men
(from the Finnish avant-garde chamber-group Toimii, conductor Salonen among
them) in white tennis togs nimbly haring around the Royal Festival Hall
stage and auditorium as though on a musical treasure hunt. A catch of
rubbish-dump items (including a Volvo bonnet) serving as percussion
instruments dangles from the front of the platform; at one point the sound
of bubbles blown in a bucket of water is amplified to serve as 'orchestral
accompaniment'.
The notion of experimental music-theatre seemed to be revived: and yet, for
all the confrontational aspects, the polychoral groups of instrumental
voices pugnaciously competing, the descent into visual farce, it is the
suggestiveness of Lindberg's actual notes that constantly holds the ear,
drawing it below the surface into a world of complex, ambiguous and even
rather mysterious musical suggestion. A possible dramatic theme can be
traced - of individual freedom of expression (embodied by the cello,
clarinet and piano solos, all full of 'personal' riffs and curlicues) at
ever-growing risk in a rigidly depersonalised world (symbolised by the
concluding savagery of full-orchestral repeated chords).
But what ultimately lends Kraft its memorable quality is the unpredictable
wit, the freedom of expression, and the fleeting touch of musical grace that
can descend on even its loopiest episodes. I don't know exactly how and why
the piece 'adds up'; but I insist that it does.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: The Dearly Beloved, by computer - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hampstead Theatre's publicity says that this new play is by Philip
Osment, but it is easier to believe that Osment just let his computer do the
work. You can just see the instructions he fed in beforehand: '1. Make it
very Chekhovian,' '2. But make it modern - eg include at least one lesbian,'
'3. Have a death in the third act,' '4. Then make everyone accept new life
in the fourth act, and learn to love one another more than before.'
The computer has done its job with bland efficiency. The Chekhovian aspects
consist of the facts that these characters are all stuck in the provinces,
that sooner or later almost everyone onstage reveals that he or she is
wailingly unhappy, that everyone spends time harking back to the past and/or
imagining the future, that conversation is littered with non-sequiturs, and
that all that happens (apart from one death offstage) is characters
arriving, departing, drinking too much, and falling in love too readily.
Alaric (cf. Trigorin in The Seagull), a sophisticated media bigshot, returns
to his native provinces. Two local women (both unhappily married) compete
for his attentions, and one local husband is wildly jealous of his success.
Alaric is in complete contrast with Terry, his mentally retarded brother who
is still looked after by their mother. The fact that Alaric speaks less
spontaneously and originally than most other people onstage is not made
interesting.
The dialogue is wholly composed of commonplaces and platitudes, apart from
the lines given to one of the local wives, Elaine, who is cast in what a
computer might take to be a fresh wise-rustic vein. But Alaric has as bad an
influence on her as on everyone else, and she is reduced to cliches before
Act Three.
The Dearly Beloved is a morass of remarks like 'What's the point of all this
suffering, I wonder?' 'Wherever you go, you take your life with you,' and
'Awful thing, isn't it, remorse?' Then there are the symbols. Baby in Pram =
New Life. The Deer = The Beauty of Nature. The Choir = Human Co-operation.
There are nine in the cast, and each of them manages to over-emphasise at
least one point during the the play. The production is by Cambridge Theatre
Company; Mike Aldreds directs. The only deft touch in the whole affair is
the title. You spend the first three acts applying it to Alaric and (in
ironic contrast) Terry, and maybe (also ironically) to the various
girfriends in the cast. Only when the death occurs does the title take new
irony and new force.

It is Derby Day and Channel 4 will show us the race live at 3.45, and all
the main events from Epsom in Derby Highlights at 11.05. But it is also the
40th anniversary of the coronation, and it is going to be difficult to
avoid. BBC1 begins at 2.20 with extracts from the BBC's original live
coverage including the procession from the palace to the abbey, the service
and crowning, and the procession through London, in Coronation Day. At 7.00,
still on BBC1, comes The Coronation - As If It Were Yesterday, introduced by
Sylvia Peters who hosted the BBC output on the day. This is a new
documentary recalling the occasion, as is ITV's two-hour Days Of Majesty
(8.00) probably the most enticing coronation item since its producers
include the excellent Peter Spry-Leverton. Finally, at midnight, comes The
Question Of Sovereignty (BBC2) in which a panel including Tony Benn and
Enoch Powell discuss how much sovereignty is left to the UK within the EC.
Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) talks to Britain's last living hangman and promises
'footage of the last working gallows in Britain'. How nice.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: All for the birds - Mining
groups are anxious to protect wildlife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birds in Nevada now have new homes courtesy of Coeur d'Alene Mines. The
company is attaching lightweight nesting boxes to its claim posts - the
posts used to mark boundaries when mining companies stake their claims.
The idea was developed by Rob Berry, senior landsman with Coeur d'Alene's
exploration subsidiary. He noticed that the hollow plastic boundary posts
often claimed more than mining land. Birds slipped into the open ends of the
posts, sometimes to nest in them, and could not always escape.
Rather than simply capping the posts, Berry developed the bird boxes, which
are folded together from one piece of corrugated cardboard and attached with
some simple hardware. The boxes are light enough for mineral exploration
teams - who frequently hike many miles into remote areas - to carry several
at a time.
Berry called on experts at the Nevada Department of Wildlife to help design
the nesting boxes, which were first tested last year at the group's
Rochester mine in Nevada, the largest primary silver mine in the US. Now
schools and Scout groups are also using them.
Berry's boxes are suitable for small birds, bluebirds and wrens, but larger
ones have been designed to accommodate kestrels, a species of owl and wood
ducks.
This, however, is not just a simple story about a nature-lover and a good
idea. Dead birds are a very big issue at open-pit mines in the US. Mining
companies are spending millions of dollars to make sure that they do not
fall foul of legislation such as the US Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The act
makes it illegal for any company or mine to kill migrating water fowl and
every death has to be reported.
The mining method that causes difficulties is called heap leaching. Ore is
placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution
is sprinkled over it. The solution collects at the bottom after percolating
through the ore and dissolving much of the metal.
This very low-cost process has enabled gold and silver to be won from rock
containing very little of the precious metals - typically well under one
ounce of gold in every tonne of ore - and it contributed to the tremendous
upsurge of gold mining activity in Australia as well as North America in the
1980s.
But tailings (waste), discharged into ponds after the gold has been
separated from the solution, still contains cyanide which takes some time to
lose its toxicity in the sunlight. Many of the US gold mines using heap
leaching are in desert areas, and when birds in the desert see a patch of
blue water there is little that can be done to stop them if they want to
drop in for a drink.
Most of the ponds are too large to be satisfactorily covered by netting  -
heavy winter snows tend to tear it. But at the Rochester mine Coeur d'Alene
tried this and various other methods to keep birds away from the cyanide
solution. To scare the birds away, strips of polished aluminium were
employed as well as propane cannons that exploded compressed gas with a loud
bang at intervals. None of these strategies worked perfectly.
Now the company is pioneering a 'closed loop' leaching system that does away
with the open ponds. Instead, the cyanide solution circulates without seeing
the light of day, and the 'pregnant' or metal-bearing solution is held in a
closed tank before processing. Even the drip-irrigation facility is buried
below the surface of the heap of ore on the leach pad.
All this obviously helps to protect birds and other wildlife. But it has
also reduced Rochester's costs by enabling leaching to go on year-round
without the heap freezing and by reducing the amount of cyanide and water
used.
Coeur d'Alene is now leaching out the same amount of metal with 4,000
gallons of solution, against the previous 7,000 gallons.
Dennis Wheeler, Coeur d'Alene's president, says the system helped to reduce
the cash costs of production at Rochester from Dollars 3.76 a troy ounce in
1991 to Dollars 3.22 last year - or by more than 14 per cent.
He says: 'Environmental protection is a key element in the mining industry
and it will remain so.' So he encourages a positive approach throughout the
company - an approach that led Berry to come forward with his bird house
initiative and resulted in Coeur d'Alene winning several environmental
awards in the past five years.
This helps create a positive image for the mining industry in its battles
with environmentalists. Wheeler suggests: 'Mining is a compatible use of the
land and fully in keeping with the US tradition of multiple use of our
lands.'
He also insists that his shareholders recognise that money spent on
environmental actions is well-spent. 'Our shareholders want to be part of an
organisation that recognises a responsibility to the environment.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Business council still on
course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES

<TEXT>
Where is the Business Council for Sustainable Development now? The
Geneva-based club of the chief executives of 48 blue-chip multinational
companies was formed three years ago to contribute a business viewpoint to
last summer's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. This appeared in the form of a
highly publicised book, Changing Course.
But since then, little has been heard of the BCSD or of Stephan Schmidheiny,
the Swiss businessman who was its prime mover. Was it just a flash in the
pan?
Apparently not. After Rio, the Council decided to embark on a second phase
extending to 1995 to explore some of the policy issues raised by Changing
Course, particularly in the financial field.
According to Hugh Faulkner, the BCSD's Canadian executive director, the
Council is setting up task forces to look at three issues: the
internalisation of environmental costs, the role of the capital markets in
promoting sustainable development and the situation in emerging markets.
The BCSD hopes to come up with recommendations for action in these areas
over the next year or two.
The Council is also looking at ways to stimulate business involvement in
third world countries. It wants to promote joint ventures in the supply of
municipal services such as water and waste management and find ways round
obstacles to investment in natural resource projects such as pulp and paper.
Meanwhile, the composition of the Council has changed. Some members, such as
Lodewijk van Wachem, senior managing director of Royal Dutch Shell, said
they were only committed up to Rio and have dropped out.
But others have joined, including Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz,
Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, and James Wolfensohn, the Wall Street
investment banker.
Council membership is now 41, but Faulkner says interest is such that he
expects it to rise to 60 before long.
As for Changing Course, the book has sold 100,000 copies and has been
translated into seven languages. It will be updated for 1995 to assess the
progress made since Rio.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: Swapping foreign debt for
nature - Madagascar and the WWF have developed a plan to save the island's
unique flora
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crustacean biologist ushered the two World Bank specialists into his
office. They were there to discuss Madagascar's debt. The biologist spoke,
the economists listened.
Such are the anomalies in this Indian Ocean island that a scientist has
become a key player in high finance. Paul Siegel, of the World Wide Fund for
Nature, is helping to reduce significantly Madagascar's commercial debt -
through a series of debt-for-nature swaps.
One of the poorest countries is thus managing to counter intense pressure on
its fragile and increasingly threatened environment.
Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, is home to a host of
unique flora and fauna. About 80 per cent of its plant species are found
nowhere else on earth.
It is proving a race against time. The island's fast-growing population of
12m people needs land for agriculture and trees for fuel and construction.
Current rates of deforestation would leave forest on only the steepest
slopes by 2020. Soil erosion is silting up rivers, over-grazing is extending
the desert and recent years of drought have further compounded problems,
particularly in the south.
The WWF has chosen to invest in debt-for-nature swaps in Madagascar because
of the close link between debt, poverty and environmental destruction. To
service its international debt, the country has to earn foreign exchange
through exports; such exports are largely agricultural, meaning undue
pressure on the land.
Since 1989, the WWF has bought Pounds 3m worth of Madagascar's commercial
debt on the secondary market, at the knock-down price of about Pounds 1.5m.
This year, the conservation organisation will buy another Pounds 2m of debt
at a similar discount. Madagascar's outstanding commercial debt is estimated
at about Pounds 59m, according to the World Bank, but only half is thought
to be available for purchase on the secondary market because of the
country's good reputation for repayment.
That reputation extends to the details of the debt-for-nature swaps. The WWF
is able to sell the debt back to the Malagasy government at 100 per cent of
face value, and receives the equivalent - Pounds 3m so far  - in local
currency. Often, developing countries operating debt-for-nature swaps will
pay back only a proportion of the debt's face value, for example 75 per
cent.
In return for such good terms, the WWF agrees not to use any of the money
for imports, thus saving precious foreign exchange.
The WWF has used its debt-for-nature money to develop a new level of
conservation managers locally. Working closely with the Department of Water
and Forestry, the fund finances the recruitment, training and salaries of
'agents pour la protection de la nature', or nature protection agents. The
APNs are recruited from local communities and help promote sustainable use
of forestry resources, environmental education and conservation activities.
Small projects are also being funded. These include reforestation, or tree
nursery schemes and 'trade-offs', where village leaders protect a forest
against fire or livestock in return for a school, clinic, or irrigation dam.
The debt-for-nature project works because it benefits everyone, Siegel says.
Aid donors like it since their money goes twice as far - every Dollars 1
donation buys Dollars 2 worth of conservation. Donations to the WWF have
come from members as well as USAID, the US agency for international
development.
The WWF benefits because the Malagasy central bank repays its loan in a lump
sum, which is then invested by the WWF and earns substantial interest
payments - enabling what Siegel calls 'endowment funding' of projects.
So far, interest payments alone have been large enough to finance almost all
of the APN projects, thus significantly extending its life span.
'That's crucial to the project's success,' Siegel says. 'It takes a long
time to grow a tree, and we now have a much more realistic timeframe to work
in.'
In the past, environmental projects have faltered as funds dried up after
only a few years.
The Malagasy government benefits because it not only reduces foreign debt,
but encourages reinvestment in environment and development schemes.
The success of endowment funding is encouraging other conservation groups to
follow suit in the country.
This year, Conservation International will purchase Dollars 5m worth (Pounds
3.2m) of debt to provide long-term financing for the protected area of
Zahamena in the country's north east.
The integrated conservation and development project is designed to encourage
local participation in the management of the nature reserve and surrounding
area.
Missouri Botanical Gardens is, meanwhile, arranging to buy Dollars 1.5m of
debt over a three-year period to finance research, training and
administration at Tsimbazaza Botanical Park in the nation's capital,
Antananarivo.

FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Stenham and Evans to Trafalgar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following months of boardroom upheaval, Cob Stenham and Dick Evans are
joining Trafalgar House as independent directors in a move foreshadowed in
the interim results in early May.
Although Hongkong Land is only a 25 per cent minority shareholder, there are
now four representatives from the Jardine Matheson empire on the Trafalgar
board, including chairman Simon Keswick, finance director David Gawler, and
non-executives Sir Charles Powell and Rodney Leach. If yesterday's
appointments are not to be seen as cosmetic, as some analysts worried,
Stenham and Evans will have an important role in listening out for the
interests of the rest of Trafalgar's investors.
It is a task that ought to be familiar for Stenham (pictured left), who is
non-executive chairman of Anglo-French paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
However, some Arjo investors have been questioning not just the size of
Stenham's remuneration but also the influence apparently being wielded by
the French minority shareholders.
The new recruits join Sir Archibald Foster, David Howell and Tony Ryan, the
embattled chairman of GPA. There have been rumours the latter will leave the
board but Trafalgar House has not made any announcement.
For Evans (pictured right), it is the first major plc outside directorship
he has accepted. Chief executive of British Aerospace since 1990, Evans
joined the military aircraft division of British Aircraft Corporation in
1967. He has been on the board of BAe since 1987.

FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Alexander declares independence from the Big Six
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
July 4, US Independence Day, will see freedom from the shackles of a Big Six
accountancy firm for John Alexander, who is joining the corporate recovery
department of accountants Pannell Kerr Forster.
His move is something of a coup for the smaller firm.
Alexander, now a general insolvency partner with KPMG Peat Marwick
specialising in liquidation and bankruptcy work, will be a senior partner
with Pannell in London.
'This is a tremendous opportunity to spread my wings and develop something,'
he says.
'It partly reflects a frustration for many people who feel the
institut-ionalisation of being in a larger firm for too long,' he says.
'There is also a feeling (of frustration) when earnings are being heavily
diluted by the weaker areas of general accountancy practice,' he adds.
He says Pannell needs a 'name' to help bring in business from the banks.
'I am dyed-in-the-wool Big Six,' he says. 'I hope we will be able to provide
a Big Six product at significantly lower costs. There is also the greater
immediacy of partner involvement.'
He says there is no current plan for him to become head of insolvency at the
firm, although he says the current head, who is based in Manchester,
acknowledges the post should be in London.
Alexander joined Thomson McLintock in 1971, joined the insolvency department
in 1974, became a partner in 1984 and stayed with the firm after the merger
with Peat Marwick in 1987.
His past work has included the Levitt Group, Rosehaugh, and trustee in
bankruptcy to musician Eric Woolfson, who wrote the musical Freudiana.
He said he had been looking around for some time for a new challenge, while
Pannell had been trying to find ways to strengthen its insolvency department
for about 18 months.

FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Accounting for Chance in matters professional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Chance has been appointed executive counsel to the joint
disciplinary scheme, the accountancy profession's highest body in the UK
which considers matters of public interest.
His post has been created as part of a restructuring of the operation of the
scheme. As counsel, he will be responsible for examining cases to establish
those worth pursuing.
He will coordinate the work of investigating accountants employed to study
the issues, and will act as prosecutor on behalf of the scheme in front of a
committee of inquiry if he decides action should proceed.
The new procedure will, for the first time, permit cross-examination of
witnesses.
'I see my role as one who must take action where it is needed, but also be
robust in deciding when action isn't needed, despite the pressures,' he
said. The same debate is taking place at the Serious Fraud Office, which
Chance helped set up and of which he was deputy director in 1987-90.

FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Wright takes a second retirement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Wright, who recently supervised the sale of most of the insurance
business of Municipal Mutual Insurance, retired at the end of last month -
for the second time.
Two years ago, Wright, who is 63, retired after 30 years with Sun Alliance,
the leading composite insurer. But he was soon back in the industry to take
charge of efforts to stave off the liquidation of the troubled MMI, which
ran up heavy losses in 1990 and 1991.
Under his guidance, large chunks of the company have been sold off and 1,500
jobs saved. MMI remains intact to administer a portfolio of property and
sell off two small subsidiaries: Prime Health and Prosperity UK. Philip
Gregory, who joined MMI in 1989 and is currently finance director, takes
over from Wright. Gregory, an accountant for 13 years at Peat Marwick, is
37.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Jobs: How to escape from the snake pit - Harvard professor
identifies the mechanisms underlying world-wide organisational disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE upon a time there were seven would-be high-fliers employed by seven
different companies who went to bed each night feeling utterly miserable.
The reason was that although the outfits they worked for were called
management consultancies, they were in fact snake pits of organisational
politics.
So the seven decided to get together and create the consultancy they had
dreamed of in their business school days. First and foremost, it would be
free from any political writhings to stop expert professionals from
spreading their wings.
Soon new clients were flocking to join those they had brought with them, and
the business was expanding fast. Soon, too, the seven owner-directors were
going to bed each night feeling utterly miserable.
The reason was that the consultancy of their dreams had somehow turned into
a snake pit as venomous as any of those they had quit. Their internal
tanglings were hampering their efforts to serve their respective clients,
and their subordinate teams were caught up in the coils. So much so that,
despite the directors' practical experience of management as well as their
masters' degrees in business administration, the very survival of their
company was coming under threat.
Then the founder who'd become the chief executive, and another of the seven
he presumably still trusted, heard that a Harvard professor named Chris
Argyris had studied predicaments like theirs. They therefore took him to
lunch, explained the problem as they saw it, and asked what they were so
mis-handling as to land their whole organisation in such a pit.
His reply, after closer inquiries, was that the root cause wasn't anything
they'd done badly, but something they were doing supremely well. It wasn't
surprising they were good at same, he said, because they along with most of
the rest of us began learning to do it before they could walk. Nor was their
outfit, which happens to be in America, alone in its pickle. His studies
show the same sickness afflicts managements not only throughout the sadly
imperfect world, but even in Japan.
Since the directors seemed honest in their search for a cure, he added, he
might be able to help although it would take some time. They agreed, on
strict condition that neither they nor their company were named.
That was in 1986, and the seven and their staff are still at it. True, there
is less writhing - the internal threat to the firm's survival, for example,
has gone - but they aren't yet completely cured.
Meanwhile Harvard University's 69-year-old professor of education and
organizational behaviour has described the exercise to date in a book* which
sheds more light on the realities of management than any the Jobs column has
read before. In the process, it has produced an addition to the Laws of
Organisational Stupidity which I've discussed on occasion recently, the last
time being four weeks ago.
What Chris Argyris views as causing the universal sickness, and which he
maintains we start practising as we leave the cradle, is a particular
response to a certain class of problems: the sort we feel are personally
threatening. Our response, which we make with increasing skill, is first to
find a way of by-passing the problem, then cover up the by-pass, then cover
up the cover-up . . . and so on.
The pattern is always the same, the professor says, even though it appears
under under different guises he terms 'defensive routines'. Their result is
that, instead of being cleared up, the original flaw not only goes on
festering, but its very existence becomes taboo - undiscussable, and so
irremediable.
*Knowledge for Action. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco (ISBN 1-55542-519-4)
Dollars 29.85.
Hence the new law of organisational stupidity called Argyris's Archetype
which, in its prototype form at least, rules: The more threatening a problem
to those responsible for solving it, the deeper it will be ingrained under
ramifying layers of camouflage.
It is more than just an addition to the laws which, as enduring readers may
recall, describe patterns of events that tend to bedevil organisations of
all types everywhere. For the Archetype explains several of the laws
previously codified, and whose baneful effects were demonstrated by the
consultancy's owner-directors. A prime example is the Abilene Paradox,
stating: People in groups agree on decisions which, as individuals, they
know are stupid.
Early on, the chief executive and the other founders separately complained
to the professor that their board meetings spent hours on minor matters,
quite regardless of the issues which all of them could see were endangering
the company. The explanation is surely that the crucial issues, being
personally threatening to at least one of the seven, had become
undiscussable. So they occupied themselves in collectively agreeing on
trivialities, which everyone present knew was a waste of time.
That is not to say such issues went undiscussed outside the boardroom.
Elsewhere, when one director was seen as responsible for a problem, others
tended not only to blame him behind his back, but to gang up against him.
The shifting coalitions that ensued called into play another law called
Winkler's Wrecker, which ordains: Division courts disruption.
Nor did the board-level writhings go un-noticed by subordinate staff. Noting
their chiefs' individual sensitivities, they adopted the law named Mangham's
Muffler, stating: When communicating to superiors, new news is bad news. The
cover-ups on high were thus reinforced by the drying up of any unexpectedly
relevant information from below. And while those are not the only laws that
follow from Argyris's Archetype, they are enough to explain the existence of
snake pits all over the globe.
So how can we climb out of them?
Well, the remedy prescribed by the Harvard professor is notoriously hard to
digest. The only cure, he says, is for organisations to start learning from
the top down - and he doesn't mean simply by sending their chiefs to
business schools and the like. In fact, he believes that formal educational
processes tend to make the underlying self-protective sickness not better,
but still worse.
In his view, our childhood experience endows us with mentally stored 'master
programs', one of which prompts us to defend ourselves when we feel under
threat. Typically, our later learning - including the sort we do with a view
to passing exams - results in our being able to execute the programs more
and more skilfully, but without changing their content at all. So when we
feel personally endangered by a problem at work, we go straight into the
by-pass and cover-up routine without bothering to consider the likely
effects on the organisation, no matter how evident and damaging they become.
To break out of the vicious circle, Chris Argyris says, we have to open up
our master programs to alterations in the light of experience, by rigorously
following certain rules of learning he sets out in the book. One, for
instance, is never to attribute responsibility for anything to anyone,
without testing the truth of that attribution by asking other people,
including the person concerned.
He readily admits that the task isn't easy. The seven owner-directors toiled
at it for 12 months or more without being able to change their behaviour one
whit. But they're doing famously a mere seven years later, he adds, and
sleeping much more securely as a result.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Management: Restoring order from chaos - A dramatic
reshaping at Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN Parcell claims gleefully that he and Geoffrey Sanderson 'still know
nothing about the theory of business process re-engineering'. Yet both are
arch-practitioners of the genre: they are two-and-a-half years into a
dramatic re-engineering exercise which has salvaged their company.
In October 1990 they were appointed by top management at Reuters, the
supplier of on-line information to financial services and media
organisations, to rescue its core UK activities.
To put no finer point on it, the boom of the 1980s, caused especially by
financial deregulation, had landed the UK operation in chaos - to an extent
which until now has not been realised beyond the company and its main
customers.
In Parcell's words: 'By the late 1980s it had acquired a reputation for poor
service and arrogance. Many orders were handled wrongly, late or not at all.
So customers got angry and often refused to pay their bills.' Since many of
those bills were wrong and unrecognisable from the original quotations which
the clients had received, this was not surprising.
When Parcell and Sanderson were called in from Reuters' continental European
operations to become managing director and deputy at the British company,
they discovered that many customers in the City of London - by far Reuters'
largest UK market - were having to wait between three and six months to
receive new hardware and services. Even if no hardware was involved, it took
a fortnight.
From that point, it often took the company two months just to send the bill,
and another three or more to collect payment. The cause of this mess was the
slow and fragmented nature of the company's long-standing procedures for
taking orders, issuing contracts, processing them, arranging and executing
installation, invoicing clients and then taking payment.
'The processes which the staff were trying to operate were highly
compartmentalised,' says Parcell. 'Even a simple order would go sequentially
through up to 12 departments' - and five computer systems. In all, there
were about 24 'hand-offs' between different specialists as an order was
processed, even if no re-work was required to correct the many errors.
Out in the field, some salesmen looked after several hundred customers at a
time, and an engineer handled about 100. So a customer 'might be served by
different people on different days of the week', says Nigel Vince, who led
the team of Oasis consultants which helped Reuters with the detailed
re-engineering work.
To make matters worse, few salesmen and engineers knew each other, since
they were located in different buildings and were rarely on the same job
together. The various departments of administrators who processed the
paperwork were also located separately. An irate client's telephone call was
almost invariably answered by someone who knew nothing about the order in
question, but had to pass the inquiry on from one department to another. So
many inquiries were never answered.
To anyone who had strayed into Reuters from a halfway modernised factory,
even back in the mid-1980s, the whole arrangement would have seemed crazy.
But, as Sanderson says, it is far easier to see, and re-design, all the
different parts of the physical flow in a factory than it is to analyse all
the inputs into a set of white-collar processes.
The Parcell-Sanderson recovery programme involved five consecutive steps,
aimed at starting to serve customers promptly, accurately and to their
satisfaction:
The organisation was broken into four geographic divisions capable of
getting closer to customers. Each division was sub-divided into a series of
small multifunctional 'account teams', consisting of 'account managers'
(former salespeople), planning engineers, and 'business administrators'. The
last group was a new breed of person who combined the roles of the previous
sales, billing, technical and general administrators, but with much more
direct customer contact than before. Each team, of between three and six
people, was grouped round an array of desks and terminals. Each was given a
small number of clients: between six and 50, depending on the size of
customers.
Except for the fact that the multi-functional teams have no designated
leader and are permanent, unlike many 'project teams' in manufacturing
industry, steps one and two are pretty conventional. For instance, each team
member still reports to his or her functional boss at present. The really
radical 're-engineering' came with the next step.
What consultants call the entire 'customer order life-cycle' (order-through
installation-to payment) was redesigned from scratch, in order to allow the
new teams to operate it swiftly and smoothly 'from end-to-end', as Sanderson
puts it. A series of the previous steps - for instance, order-taking and the
issue of contracts - were condensed into one, or avoided entirely by the
merging of administration tasks. Instead of every step being done
sequentially by separate departments, several activities are now carried out
in parallel by the team members.
As a result, the number of hand-offs through which the process had to pass
was reduced from two dozen to four. A series of timing and other performance
criteria was also laid down, in most cases for the first time, so that
customers and staff knew exactly what was expected.
The training and change process for the 900 staff involved was 'quite
draconian and dictatorial', says Parcell, rather than along the consultative
and 'empowering' lines advocated in most re-engineering theory.
Two years on, Parcell and Sanderson recognise that pressure is now building
up among the teams for more latitude on various aspects of daily
decision-making. Few changes have yet been made to people's incentives,
except for the crucial one that sales staff now receive commission once
orders are installed, rather than received.
Starting in early 1992, the company's records have been straightened out - a
slog of a process which will be complete in July. The reliable and flexible
old computer system, which has operated the new order process reasonably
well, is in the process of being replaced by a more up-to-date system
designed specifically to suit the new process. Unlike the re-engineering so
far, which has caused no job reductions - rather, the reverse - the new
system will automate a number of clerical functions.
The impact of the new, team-based process has been striking. More than 95
per cent of installations are now on time: between three and four weeks
after ordering if hardware and services are both involved, and barely a day
for services alone. Bills are now more than 98 per cent accurate and debt
from recalcitrant customers is minimal.
Independent market research studies show that, on almost every category of
customer attitudes, dissatisfaction has been brought down to 10 per cent or
less.
The way most front-line employees feel about the change is encapsulated by
one business administrator, Alan Maguire. The old atmosphere of all-round
'firefighting', and buck-passing between specialists, has been replaced by
one of mutual help and 'covering' for each other, he says. 'It's astonishing
how much has been achieved by co-locating us not just in the same building
or on the same floor, but around the same desk.'

There is more than a hint of impatience in the voice of Anne Watts, equal
opportunities director of Midland Bank, as she sets out the bank's record on
providing childcare.
'Midland has been at the forefront on childcare. We've done our bit, but we
can't do it all. Government, where is your response?'
That question is being increasingly put by UK blue-chip companies who feel
that their childcare efforts are not matched by government action.
Yesterday saw the launch of an employers' pressure group, Employers for
Childcare (EFC), to lobby the government and the main political parties.
Supported by the Confederation of British Industry, the principal activists,
apart from Midland, include Kingfisher, Shell UK, TSB and British Gas.
The group is not necessarily demanding large cash injections from public
funds for childcare. It wants the government to take the lead in developing
a national strategy for the daycare of children up to the age of 14.
National standards for provision, an examination of the current tax rules,
overall priorities on where services should be concentrated and an exchange
of ideas on best practice, are all subjects the group wants examined.
Employers, parents and care providers have their part to play, says EFC, but
without central leadership 'isolated examples of good practice in childcare
provision are swamped in a patchwork of inconsistent and badly co-ordinated
services'.
The facts, says EFC, speak for themselves. The UK has among the poorest
public provision in the European Community and 'this means that large sums
of money are being wasted on training, because employees with valuable
skills cannot remain in the workforce without adequate childcare,' says the
group's launch document.
Figures collected by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggest that
registered daycare is available for less than 8 per cent of children under
five in the UK; even when children reach that age, the school day finishes
mid-afternoon and holidays take up 175 days a year.
It could be argued that if employers are finding they are losing skilled
labour, the market would push them to make the necessary provision. The
benefits are tangible. For example, Midland's 114 nurseries, which provide
850 subsidised places, plus 60 holiday play-schemes, are considered by the
bank to have had a strong impact on the retention of staff. In 1988 only 30
per cent of women returned after maternity leave. By 1992, that had risen to
75 per cent.
EFC's reply is that leaving childcare to employers can only ever work to a
very limited degree: smaller companies may be unable to fund the setting-up
of schemes and are likely to lack the know-how; even the largest employers
are unable to provide the choice of quality care required in every
geographical location.
There is resentment that employers are being landed with an activity that
consumes disproportionate resources. As the launch document states:
'(childcare schemes) should not take large amounts of management time and
skills from the development of their core business.'
Chris Marsh, employment policy adviser to Shell UK, wants the government to
recognise that market forces will not solve the problem: 'Many equal
opportunities policies, such as enhancing maternity provision and
introducing career breaks and flexible working, can be done by companies
themselves. But childcare is of a different order of magnitude and
complexity.'
Shell has a nursery for employees' children in Aberdeen, one of its main
locations, but employees at the company's London head office travel in from
32 different London boroughs and 17 counties. John Collins, Shell's
chairman, says in EFC's launch document, that the company 'cannot make a
tangible contribution over such a wide geographical area, which is why we
look for an overall response to the issue, co-ordinated by the government,
in which we can play our part'. British Airways points out that, even with a
company subsidy, the cost to employees of a workplace nursery place can be
out of proportion to their income, particularly for those who work part
time. Taking a small child into a city workplace nursery is not always the
preferred option for employees.
While workplace nurseries are only feasible in a few situations, EFC points
out that current tax policies are inconsistent and favour nurseries above
other provision. British Gas, for example, provides nearly 2,000 of its
employees with Pounds 30-worth of vouchers for childcare each per week, but
the vouchers - unlike subsidised nursery places - are considered a taxable
benefit.
The group plans to put these detailed points to the government and to press
for one department to take the lead. Fiona Cannon, TSB Group's equal
opportunities manager, says the priority is to get all political parties to
accept that childcare needs a national framework.
'The framework is the issue, rather than individual solutions to individual
problems,' she says.
Current members of Employers for Childcare are: BBC, British Airways,
British Gas, British Telecom, Co-operative Bank, Grand Metropolitan,
Kingfisher, Midland Bank, Rover Group, Shell UK, and TSB Group. Further

FT  02 JUN 93 / ITV companies fear takeover rule changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST three significant ITV companies will vigorously oppose any
immediate relaxation of the rules on ITV ownership, which prevent any of the
nine largest companies taking each other over.
The companies are Anglia, the ITV company for the east of England, HTV,
which covers Wales and the west, and Meridian, the south of England
franchise holder.
Anglia and HTV, medium-sized quoted ITV companies, are worried that they
could be taken over if the rules changed. Mr David McCall, Anglia chief
executive, said yesterday: 'I am not convinced by the economic arguments at
this stage that there need to be only four ITV companies.'
Anglia had a stronger balance sheet than some larger ITV companies and has
been expanding internationally through deals with Home Box Office of the US.
Mr Charles Romaine, chief executive of HTV, said ITV should be reviewed in
1996. 'We fear that the regional nature of ITV will disappear if changes are
made so quickly to ownership,' he said.
Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, also believes there should
be no piecemeal tinkering with the rules.
The Labour peer recently told the House of Lords he wanted an extension of
the moratorium on hostile takeovers of ITV companies that runs out in
December. He also called for a comprehensive review of the 1990 Broadcasting
Act in 1996.
Following intense lobbying by a number of the larger ITV companies, Mr Peter
Brooke, the National Heritage secretary plans to review ITV ownership rules.
He wants to examine the economic case that might justify the proposition
that ITV companies need to be bigger to compete internationally.
He intends to call a meeting of all the ITV companies to discuss the issue
and is likely to hear sharply conflicting views.
HTV is scathing about arguments that Pounds 100m could be saved each year by
the removal of unnecessary duplication in the ITV system.
The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that although it
will not oppose a relaxation of the ownership rules it will insist on
maintaining separate regional licences and the programme obligations that go
with them. This could limit potential savings.
The ownership issue is also likely to become political. Backbench MPs will
almost certainly be mobilised to oppose anything that would undermine the
separate existence of companies such as Anglia or HTV.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Holiday company clients face loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX HUNDRED holidaymakers are in danger of losing money following the
collapse of Oxford-based SFV Holidays last month, according to the company
which has bought the SFV client list.
Kingsland Holidays, a Ply-mouth-based company that organises holidays in
France, said yesterday that it had bought the client list from liquidators
Berley and Co for an undisclosed sum.
Mr Simon Law, a Kingsland director, said: 'We have not bought SFV Holidays
in full, nor are we in a position to take on its debts. Our main
responsibility is to facilitate completion of endangered holiday bookings.'
The company estimates that 650 of SFV's 820 bookings in French villas were
made by credit card, which would enable customers to receive refunds. As
each booking was for a party of holidaymakers, Kingsland estimates the total
number of people who made bookings was 3,000. About 20 per cent did not book
by credit card and their only redress will be as ordinary creditors.
SFV was an unbonded company and had not arranged protection for customers.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had told the company it
was not required to protect clients' money because it was not a package
operator. This was because it allowed clients to choose their own ferry
crossings without assistance from the company.
Kingsland, a fully bonded member of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators, said it had been in touch with owners of self-catering
accommodation in France who had taken bookings from SFV. Mr Law said
property-owners were co-operating with Kingsland, even though some had not
received any payment from SFV.

FT  02 JUN 93 / LWT staff ask for part of share scheme profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF AT London Weekend Television are organising a petition asking for a
slice of the more than Pounds 55m likely to go to the London ITV company's
management from a controversial share scheme.
The petition is critical of the management share scheme, which it says will
see unprecedented rewards going to management, leaving the rest of the
company with nothing 'except longer hours, lower take-home pay and reduced
conditions of employment'.
The petition, being organised by LWT officials of Bectu, the broadcasting
union, asks for 'a significant proportion' of the scheme's profits to be
redistributed in the form of shares to all staff.
As part of a company restructuring 44 LWT managers were able to subscribe
for unlisted management shares at 83.2p. If the share price averages 278p or
more during the month following this September's announcement of LWT's
half-year results, each management share converts into 4.08 ordinary shares.
At 385p the shares would be worth Pounds 55.54m and create 15 LWT
millionaires.
The shares held by LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland would be worth more
than Pounds 7m and Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, Mr Brian Tesler, former
managing director and Mr Ron Miller, advertising director, would all get
more than Pounds 5m.
LWT shares yesterday closed unchanged at 377p.
One of the petition organisers said yesterday: 'The atmosphere at LWT is
explosive. Staff are hurt, humiliated and angry. Everywhere you go there is
only one topic of conversation.'
Staff are angry because they had no special payments for their contribution
to regaining LWT's franchise although they did receive a Pounds 50 Marks &amp;
Spencer voucher.
There is also anger that the company has decided this year to reduce the
percentage of profit going to profits related pay from 8 per cent to 7 per
cent.
At a recent meeting with staff Mr Dyke said LWT was still the highest paying
ITV company.
He said: 'Clearly I don't think anyone ever believed that our share price
would be nearly Pounds 4 at this stage.'
Mr Dyke also conceded that those staff chosen for inclusion in the
management share scheme had been 'an arbitrary number of people at an
arbitrary level'.
He has also indicated privately he would be prepared to do something for
staff from the share scheme's profit but he did not know whether he could
persuade the rest of the management.

<TEXT>
BBC WORLD Service Television and Reuters, the international news and
information group, are planning to launch a 24-hour-a-day satellite
television news service aimed at Latin America, Spain and the Hispanic
population of the US.
The two groups said yesterday they were negotiating with the Telemundo
Group, the Spanish-language television network that operates in the US. The
aim is to launch the service later this year. It would be beamed from Miami
by satellite to cable networks and broadcast stations throughout the
Americas.
A deal would mark a further stage in BBC World Service Television's strategy
of taking its service round the globe. It is already available throughout
Asia, in Africa and in Europe and plans are well advanced to launch in
Japan. Reuters has also been increasing its interests in television.
The new service would have two main sources of news. London-based Reuters
Television, formally Visnews, would provide international newsgathering
resources and BBC World Service Television would contribute international
news and programmes made for Spanish-speaking audiences in association with
the BBC's Latin American Service.
Mr Joaquin Blaya, president of Telemundo, said yesterday in New York the
formation of the service would be 'a milestone in Spanish-language
programming which would revolutionise Latin America from an information
point of view'.

LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday warned that improvements in service on London's
Underground network could be jeopardised if the government goes ahead with
reductions in investment announced in the Autumn Statement.
The company, announcing the results of the first year of the Underground's
Customer Charter, said that it had achieved all its service performance
targets for 1992-93. These covered train service, punctuality, cleanliness,
staff helpfulness, ticketing, escalator and escalator service and station
closures.
In some cases targets had been comfortably exceeded, with 91 per cent of
lifts in service during the peak hours compared with a target of 85 per
cent. The number of violent crimes against customers was 1.29 per million
journeys, compared with a target of 1.6 per million.
In the first year of its Customer Charter London Underground paid out just
more than Pounds 68,000 in refunds for delays of 20 minutes or more which
were the company's responsibility.
Targets for most performance indicators will be increased next year with
much higher standards of train cleanliness, information for passengers and
reliability of train services and lifts.
But Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director, said efficient management alone
could not sustain service improvements if investment fell.
He said: 'The key to a decently modern metro is good management and the
right level of investment.'
Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said he shared London
Underground's disappointment at funding. He promised to battle with the
Treasury to secure the best possible deal in the next public expenditure
round in the autumn.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE DISH ownership increased by 52,000 between February and March to a
total of 2.15m according to the latest figures from GfK, the market research
group, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The study, commissioned by the ITV Association, also estimates that between
June and December last year there was a rise of 290,000 subscribers to the
pay channels of British Sky Broadcasting.
The group estimates that by the end of the year there were 1.1m subscribers
to Sky Sports and adds that only 13 per cent of survey respondents said the
sports channel was a significant incentive to purchase a satellite dish.
The research is based on a six-monthly ownership survey of 10,000 homes
updated by monthly sales information. The survey does not cover Northern
Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.
The latest figure for June, from Barb, which provides official broadcasting
ratings, estimates that there are 2.44m homes with satellite dishes in the
UK, with a further 694,000 receiving satellite channels from cable systems.
Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, yesterday accused
BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake - of over-stating the number of satellite homes.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Single bargaining agreements 'rising'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 200,000 workers are covered by single-table collective bargaining
agreements, which manual and white-collar employees negotiate jointly with
management, according to a study by the Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology reported in today's issue of Labour Research magazine.
An estimated 60 companies have such deals, twice the number of three years
ago. The most prominent recent single-table deals have been reached at
British Steel, the Rover and Vauxhall car companies, as many as 43 of the 65
new National Health Service trusts and nine of the 10 privatised water
companies.
Other companies which have moved to single-table bargaining in the past
three years include BP Chemicals at Grangemouth, PowerGen and National Grid,
Lever Brothers and Synpac Chemicals.
The government-commissioned workplace survey carried out in 1990 found that
'there was no evidence of any widespread move towards single-table
bargaining'.
A number of such arrangements were introduced before 1990, however,
including those at Bulmers Cider, Coca-Cola Schweppes, Ind Coope Burton
Brewery, Cummins Engines and 17 of the 18 independent television companies.
Mr Gregor Gall, who carried out the research, said the main reason for the
sudden increase in single-table bargaining stemmed in part from the demise
of national and company-wide agreements.
He said the introduction of more decentralised bargaining structures, which
related pay closely to the needs of the local labour market and the
profitability of each particular company, were a signifi-cant reason for the
increase.
Mr Gall said employers want to end the traditional and complex multi-union
bargaining system, where companies had to deal separately with many unions,
so they were better equipped to 'respond more quickly to changes in their
markets with changes in production' .
Companies saw the value of single table bargaining because it enabled them
to introduce working practice reforms without any danger of sparking
industrial conflict between their own workers.
Mr Gall said the new wave of single bargaining deals stemmed mainly from
employer initiatives that were not being opposed but were being welcomed by
trade unions.
Many trade unions saw such developments as a way of producing much greater
inter-union harmony and co-operation.

<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Association of Head Teachers yesterday set out its strong
opposition to the government's planned league tables of school performance,
on the eve of a speech to its annual conference by Mr John Patten, education
secretary.
Mr David Hart, general secretary, said when opening the conference in
Newcastle that headteachers in England and Wales would continue to object to
'unfair and misleading' national league tables, even if the government
decided to reform the national curriculum tests on which they were based.
He said: 'We are opposed to league tables and the position is not just for
this year . . . We would be opposed to league tables even if the tests had
been reformed next year so that they were satisfactory. We are opposed to
league tables pure and simple.'
This afternoon delegates will debate a motion calling on Mr Patten to
'abandon any plans to press ahead with publication on a school by school
basis'. An alternative motion 'deplores the league table mentality which has
arisen to provide parents and the media with lists of meaningless
examination statistics and attendance figures'.
Mr Hart said he was under 'enormous pressure' from his members to withhold
results from local education authorities, and reveal them only to pupils,
parents and governors.
The three largest teachers' unions are refusing to implement the tests,
which are due to start in schools in England and Wales next week.
In a statement last night Mr Patten said: 'The essence of professionalism is
an openness to scrutiny. Everyone - taxpayers, employers and the wider
community, as well as parents - has a right to know how all schools are
performing and whether standards are improving.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / CBI chief slams training policy
</HEADLINE>

   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's record on training is 'one of the worst in the developed world', Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said yesterday.
Mr Davies said this was not because of a lack of funding, but because
neither the government nor industry made the best use of training resources.
Delivering the first in a series of lectures organised by the London School
of Economics and the Social Market Foundation, an independent think-tank, he
called for Britain's training system to become more market-oriented.
The CBI favours linking the funding of all post-16 training and education to
individual trainees. It believes doing so would create a more flexible
system, foster personal responsibility and force training providers to be
more accountable to their customers, so enhancing quality and choice.
Mr Davies also said British companies should be more ready to reward the
results of vocational training. Pay differentials between skilled and
unskilled labour were smaller in the UK than in Germany or France.
Mr Davies said: 'Employers themselves are giving mixed and confusing signals
about the qualifications they value.'
He said research in England and Wales showed that males with vocational
qualifications equivalent to National Vocational Qualifications at level 2
could be expected to earn significantly less than their counterparts with
GCSEs.

THE MAJORITY of workers in the British oil industry are no longer covered by
collective agreements negotiated by trade unions. Oil companies are imposing
sweeping changes in working practices through individual contracts of
employment.
Shell's decision to scrap collective bargaining at its Haven refinery on the
Thames estuary next month is a further step towards what Mr Fred Higgs,
negotiator for the TGWU transport union, calls a 'collusive employer attack'
designed to transform the British oil industry into a 'union-free
environment'.
But the leading companies - Shell, Esso, BP and Mobil - deny any such
co-ordination.
They point out that the policy towards the unions differs between parts of
their business from offshore work and refining to distribution.
A number of comprehensive restructuring deals have been introduced in the
oil industry since 1989. Many involve the ending of trade union recognition.
These include:
Process operators and craftsmen at BP Chemicals' Baglan Bay site, on the
Swansea side of Port Talbot in south Wales, moved to individual contracts of
employment from March 1 last year and their conditions were made the same as
those of white-collar staff.
In addition, multi-skilled production teams were introduced and unions were
derecognised in collective bargaining.
BP oil terminal workers are no longer represented by unions for collective
bargaining. The company said it continued to work in harmony with them in
its distribution business and refining operation at Grangemouth, on the
River Forth.
There are collective agreements at its Sullom Voe terminal in Shetland, but
not in its offshore operations.
Shell tanker drivers were put on staff contracts and collective bargaining
with the TGWU ended last July. Individual workers can still be represented
by a union official in grievance cases or discipline hearings.
Craftsmen at Shell Oil's Stanlow plant in Essex have lost union recognition
but workers belonging to the TGWU are still covered by collective agreements
as the union agreed to sweeping working practice reforms. At Haven, all
unions face derecognition except for individual grievances.
In September 1991 Esso moved its tanker drivers to individual contracts of
employment and staff status and the TGWU was derecognised.
Merit-based pay replaced negotiated wages, taking average earnings to about
Pounds 32,000 a year.
Maintenance workers at Mobil's Coryton refinery in Essex moved to staff
status last August, with the end of collective bargaining. The unions
retained individual representation rights on disciplinary issues.
In mid-1994, at the end of the current two-year collective deal, 300
operators at Coryton will move to individual contracts of employment. Unions
will continue to represent them on non-pay issues.
The 320 workers at Mobil's Birkenhead operations who are covered by two
collective agreements will continue to have union bargaining. Mobil said:
'We vary our approach between business operations to suit our needs.'
The drive against union recognition in oil stems from adverse market
pressures caused by overcapacity and low oil prices. The companies believe
they must reduce costs to become more competitive with the best in
continental Europe.
This has meant drastic changes in working practices with the abolition of
demarcation lines and the introduction of multi-skilling and teamwork.
It has also meant individual performance-related pay systems, staff status
for blue-collar workers and the introduction of contract labour.
Increasingly, the oil companies see no reason to bargain collectively with
trade unions. But Mr Alan Mitchell of Incomes Data Services, the independent
research organisation, said total derecognition remained rare.
Mr Mitchell said: 'Unions continue to retain a representational role in
areas like health and safety or dealing with the problems of individual
workers who remain union members in disciplinary and grievance disputes.'
The changes have so far brought little resistance from the trade unions
because members have been unwilling to endanger jobs by fighting
derecognition - and the pay and conditions of most oil workers is
substantial in spite of the end of collective bargaining.
Oil is not a cheap labour industry, nor will it become so.
Providing a service for the individual oil worker may provide a new role for
the unions, but this will leave them limited and marginalised. And a growing
number of union officials fear the drive to derecognition in oil could
encourage employers in other industries to follow suit.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Brewers urge cut in beer excise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BREWING industry is urging the government to lower the new rate of
excise duty on beer, which took effect yesterday, on the grounds that it
breaches a pledge by ministers that it would not raise more revenue than the
previous system.
The Brewers' Society said that if the new system had been applied over the
past 12 months it would have yielded Pounds 64m - or 3 per cent - more than
the old one.
The society said ministers had promised that the rate would be fiscally
neutral and would be rectified if that proved not to be the case. It called
on the government to change the rate before the November Budget.
Customs and Excise expressed surprise that the brewers had not complained
earlier and said they had not substantiated their claim. It said the new
rate had been calculated in consultation with the society after a survey of
brewers.
The approximate rate had been indicated to the society a year ago and
confirmed in early March. The society had not challenged it until three
weeks ago, however, and had produced supporting data only last Friday.
The society said it was unsure until recently how the system would work. But
Customs and Excise said all the details had been settled three months ago,
except for a minor question concerning warehouses.
Customs and Excise also pointed out that the revenue neutrality of the rate
would depend on the types of beer being sold. It said ministers would
examine before the next Budget any data supplied by the society.
The new system charges duty on the volume and alcoholic strength of beer
production instead of on the gravity of liquid before fermentation.

MANUFACTURING output expanded for the fourth month in succession in May, the
latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers shows, Emma Tucker writes.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its Purchasing
Managers' Index recorded a level of 53 per cent in May. This was slightly
less than in April but a level above 50 per cent indicates that
manufacturing output is still expanding. The index is based on a weighted
average of movements of several components including new orders, output and
employment.
The institute, which represents UK purchasing managers with overall spending
power of Pounds 250bn a year, said many companies had reported an increase
in levels of employment.

FT  02 JUN 93 / A most favoured lady of the garter: Neil Buckley considers
the commercial relevance of the sought-after royal warrant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS JUNE KENTON knows the Queen better than most. She supplies her underwear.
'I have the most personal warrant there is,' says the proprietor of Rigby &amp;
Peller, corsetieres, who fits the Queen and several of the 'younger royals'
for bras and corsets.
She is just one of 890 royal warrant holders, permitted to style themselves
'By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen', and to display the royal arms on
their buildings, products and letterhead.
Holders range from BP, Boots, ICI, and Blue Circle Cement, to the post
office at Ballater, near Balmoral, the garden centre in Tetbury,
Gloucestershire - which supplies food for Prince William's rabbits - and
Deosan, a Northampton company that supplies sheep dips by appointment to the
Queen Mother.
The royal crest has traditionally been a mark of prestige but, 40 years on
from the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, how has the warrant system been
affected by the bad publicity that has surrounded the royal family for the
past year?
Commander Hugh Faulkner, secretary of the Royal Warrant Holders'
Association, said: 'We certainly haven't had anyone handing back their
warrants.
'The publicity has not made any difference to the eagerness with which
suppliers view the possibility of being granted a warrant. Thank God.'
The present system of granting royal warrants dates from the reign of Queen
Victoria.
Applicants must have supplied the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen
Mother or Prince Charles for at least three years.
Some companies have become almost synonymous with the royal family, giving a
substantial boost to their brand name. Mr Gerald Hamilton, managing director
of Fortnum &amp; Mason - sometimes known as the 'Queen's grocer' - says the
warrant 'is still seen to be an accolade. Even today you can hardly get a
better recommendation'.
Mr Hamilton says the royal crest helps to attract tourists and visitors to
the store, and has enhanced its image overseas, with exports accounting for
14 per cent of its business.
It is debatable how much the royal seal of approval boosts sales of everyday
brands such as Heinz baked beans or Kellogg's corn flakes. But for smaller
companies selling high-quality, often high-priced goods, the royal warrant
can open many doors.
Ms Kenton says royal associations proved invaluable when marketing in the
US.
'Having a royal warrant says you are a company of repute, of honour, and
that you work to a high standard,' she said. 'But you can't rely on a
warrant to bring you business. It's no meal ticket. You have to work at the
business all the time,' she says.
Mr Gerald Bodmer, managing director of Launer, which supplies the Queen's
handbags, says his company could never have grown at the same pace without
the royal warrant.
Launer has a niche market, selling real leather handbags at an average price
of Pounds 350. 'We don't even put 'real leather' or 'Made in England' on the
products. It's enough to have the royal crest.'
Mr Bodmer remembers fondly a visit from his most valued customer: 'She was
really interested and asked lots of questions. She's a very nice lady. Not
like the politicians.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / DTI report into Astra cost Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's report into Astra, the defence
company which went into receivership last year, has been completed at a cost
of Pounds 2.1m.
Some witnesses have complained that the time taken to complete the inquiry -
three years after the inspectors were appointed - has adversely affected
their careers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said in a letter to one of the
witnesses that the timetable might have been affected by factors outside the
inspectors' control, including 'the failure of some witnesses to attend or
delays in providing information'.
The first draft of the report was sent to up to 25 witnesses last summer and
contained criticisms of former directors of Astra and its former auditors,
Stoy Hayward.
In a move believed to have resulted from the DTI inquiry, Mr Paul Smith, a
corporate finance partner who worked on the Astra account at Stoy Hayward,
is now to spend most of his time on internal computer projects.
Mr Philip Rusted, an audit partner working on the account, left the firm in
March last year.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Lloyd's denies bankruptcy claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS THAT Conservative MPs may be forced into bankruptcy by their losses
at Lloyd's were yesterday described as 'completely misleading' by Lloyd's
and dismissed by some of the politicians involved.
Lady Archer, who chairs the insurance market's hardship committee which
provides financial help to hard-hit Names, said: 'Lloyd's does not pursue
members into bankruptcy provided they admit their liability and agree to pay
what part of their loss they can afford.' Lloyd's accepted that Names - the
individuals whose assets support the insurance market  - could become
bankrupt as a result of losses from other business ventures.
Mr Jerry Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a Lloyd's Name since 1962,
said: 'The sort of assumption that people are going to be bankrupted and
lose their seats is ludicrous at this stage.' It was 'both premature and
ill-advised,' he added.
Sir Richard Body, a long-standing Tory MP and Name, said some Conservative
MPs who had lost money at Lloyd's, the London-based insurance market, could
decide to leave the Commons in order to pursue more lucrative careers
outside politics, but he did not think that the plight of any MP would get
as far as bankruptcy.
The terms of hardship arrangements, which remain in force for three years,
vary according to individual circumstances. Typically Names are allowed to
retain an income of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year. Lloyd's
takes a charge over any property but the Name is allowed to continue living
in a 'modest' home - which in London could be worth up to about Pounds
150,000.
An MP loses his seat only if a court judges him bankrupt and that
adjudication is not annulled after six months.
The Times yesterday reported that 47 Conservative MPs were Names in 1990,
the market's latest year of account, for which Lloyd's expects to post
record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn in June. Average
losses for each of the 28,770 Names trading in 1990 are likely to exceed
Pounds 100,000 each.
The Lloyd's 'Blue Book', which contains details of Names' syndicate
participations, shows that only a handful of the MPs were members of the
hardest-hit syndicates.
Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, whose Lloyd's losses have been
well publicised, is a member of the disastrous Gooda Walker syndicates 290,
298 and 299, which have specialised in catastrophe reinsurance and have
suffered some of the heaviest losses at Lloyd's. His majority is 4,958.
Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) is a member of two loss-making Feltrim
syndicates which also specialised in the same business. His majority is
19,094.
With Mr Marland and Mr Tredinnick, Mr Ian Lang, MP for Galloway &amp; Upper
Nithsdale, the Scottish secretary, is a member of Rose Thomson Young
syndicate 255. His majority is 2,468.
Several Conservative MPs are set to make smaller than average losses,
however. The Lloyd's affairs of seven MPs are handled by the Roberts &amp;
Hiscox agency which is forecasting average losses for its Names of only 7
per cent of capacity (the amount of premiums a Name can accept), far below
the market average.
Both Lloyd's and Tory MPs made clear that there was no question of any
preferential treatment for MPs facing losses.
Mr Ian Taylor, Tory MP for Esher, who two years ago urged the government to
act to help Lloyd's Names by enabling them to throw back losses against
profits in previous years, said yesterday he was disappointed ministers had
not accepted his proposals.
The government made it clear yesterday that even though the existing Finance
Bill, which is the subject of detailed discussion by MPs, contains the
Lloyd's provision announced in the Budget allowing Lloyd's Names to set
aside tax-free reserves against losses incurred on future trading, ministers
do not intend to amend the legislation to provide help for Names in
difficulties.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Brown calls for overdraft charge inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into the system of charges operated by the high street clearing
banks was demanded yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who
said charges for unauthorised overdrafts were 'little short of usurious'.
He warned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that millions of consumers
would be shocked by the levels of charges, and would expect protection from
him.
The condemnation came on the day that National Westminster Bank became the
first of Britain's big four banks to introduce a charge of Pounds 3.50 a day
on current account holders who overdraw 'substantially' without authority.
According to calculations carried out for Mr Brown by the House of Commons
library, NatWest is making charges equivalent to an annualised percentage
rate of interest (APR) of 369 per cent for an unauthorised overdraft of
Pounds 1,000.
The calculations include both interest charged on overdrafts and
administrative charges. Mr Brown said the NatWest charge for an unauthorised
Pounds 100 overdraft was equivalent to an APR of more than 1m per cent.
The figures suggest that at Barclays an unauthorised overdraft of Pounds 100
would attract charges equivalent to an APR of 961 per cent, at Lloyds 238
per cent, and at Midland 733 per cent.
Mr Brown dismissed criticism of his calculations, saying charges, commission
and interest rates all contributed to the cost of borrowing.
Total charges for the top eight banks, he added, were more than Pounds
6.2bn, compared with just more than Pounds 4bn before the recession started
two-and-a-half years ago.
Among the remedies which Mr Brown urged were a right to be told the details
of charges in advance, recourse to a statutory ombudsman and the right to
information about bank charges in the form of a league table.
NatWest said yesterday it did not understand how a figure of 1m per cent APR
could be reached under its charging structure. It said rates for
unauthorised overdrafts were clearly set out in advance for its customers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S failure to stay in the European exchange rate mechanism was in
large part due to poor preparation by Mr John Major, then chancellor, before
entry in October 1990, Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor says in an
article published today, Emma Tucker writes.
In the London Business School's International Financial Outlook Lord Lawson
says that the UK joined the ERM at too high a rate. He criticises the
government for inadequately agreeing entry terms with the Bundesbank
beforehand.
'Sterling joined at a rate which the Bundesbank regarded from the outset as
too high and which it therefore felt no great moral obligation to support -
a fact that was later to become all too apparent to the financial markets,'
he says.
Lord Lawson also says there is no conceivable gradual 'glide-path' to allow
an exchange rate system to transform imperceptibly into a single currency.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Finance warning for Underground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday warned that improvements in service on London's
Underground network could be jeopardised if the government goes ahead with
reductions in investment announced in the Autumn Statement.
The company, announcing the results of the first year of the Underground's
Customer Charter, said that it had achieved all its service performance
targets for 1992-93. These covered train service, punctuality, cleanliness,
staff helpfulness, ticketing, escalator service and station closures.
Targets for most performance indicators will be increased next year with
much higher standards of train cleanliness, information for passengers and
reliability of train services and lifts.
But Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director, said efficient management alone
could not sustain service improvements if investment fell.
He said: 'The key to a decently modern metro is good management and the
right level of investment.'
Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said he shared London
Underground's disappointment at funding.
He promised to battle with the Treasury to secure the best possible deal in
the next public expenditure round in the autumn.
The options for reforming the laws regulating taxis and minicabs in England
and Wales will be reviewed in a green paper to be published in the summer.
Mr Norris said yesterday that the government would bring forward legislation
after a period of consultation.
The announcement follows the failure of a working party on the safety of
taxis and minicabs in London to reach agreement on the licensing of
minicabs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR POLLUTION has been worsening recently, although levels are generally
better than a decade ago, details in the Department of the Environment's
15th annual digest of environmental statistics show.
The UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to global warming, were
3 per cent higher in 1991 than in 1990, although they have fallen by a fifth
in the past decade. Environmentalists fear the recent rise could jeopardise
Britain's ability to meet international targets on global warming.
Traffic emissions of nitrogen oxide rose by 73 per cent between 1981 and
1991, and emissions of black smoke by 86 per cent. The report adds: 'Poor
air quality was recorded at all urban monitoring sites in 1991.'
The number of UK beaches complying with European Community bacteria
standards rose by 3.4 per cent to 328 last year, according to the National
River Authority's annual report on bathing water, published yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR HAS won overall control of the Association of County Councils for the
first time in the organisation's 104-year history, John Authers writes.
The development - which follows the Conservatives' disastrous showing in
last month's county council elections when they lost control of all but one
of the 20 counties they were defending - intensifies the difficulties facing
Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, in his dealings with local
government.
Labour's majority was assured yesterday when a selection panel at hung
Cheshire county council gave the party two seats on the ACC executive, with
one each for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. This ensures the party of
an overall majority of five seats on the ACC's executive council. The
Conservatives are now the ACC's third-largest party.
This puts Labour in charge of three of the four main representative bodies
for local government in mainland Britain. The Association of Metropolitan
Authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are Labour
controlled, while the Association of District Councils remains under a
minority Tory leadership.
Labour's strength on the ACC was boosted last week by a decision of
Labour-controlled Derbyshire county council to rejoin the association after
a 12-year gap, giving the party an extra three seats.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Property debt sale urged by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday urged banks to consider selling their loans to
property companies in the form of property-backed bonds.
Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, said that
converting debt into securities 'frees the way for property companies to
raise new capital, refinance debt and strengthen their own balance sheets,
and in some instances injects liquidity into the market'.
Speaking at the launch of the Association of Property Bankers Mr Kent for
the first time gave qualified support to the newly created market in
distressed corporate debt.
In an speech last year Mr Kent concentrated on the potential pitfalls for a
company in financial difficulties if that company's banks decided to sell
the loans they had made to it. Yesterday, however, he said that the sale of
the debt to new investors had 'the potential for a beneficial and productive
effect for a company in difficulties'.
New investors might have expertise relevant to the company or might be able
to take a longer-term view of the returns to be made from the debt than the
company's bankers.
Mr Kent made two suggestions aimed at reducing the risk that banks would
repeat their 1980s error of acquiring excessive exposure to property in
different parts of the country.
He asked whether 'banks would benefit from a closer awareness of the
planning and development process'.
He also invited bankers to comment on whether it would be useful for new and
more detailed statistics to be gathered on property lending and how this
could be done.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Mates brought in by Nadir PR adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, JIMMY BURNS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Mates first took an interest in Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive
businessman, after an approach by Mr Mark Rogerson, one of Mr Nadir's public
relations advisers.
In a statement issued on Monday Mr Mates, the minister who is at the centre
of a political row over his relationship with the founder of the Polly Peck
business empire, said he had been approached to take an interest in Mr
Nadir's affairs by a 'a constituent who was one of Mr Nadir's advisers'.
It emerged yesterday that the constituent was Mr Rogerson, a former BBC
journalist and founder of Morgan &amp; Rogerson, a public relations firm which
advises Mr Nadir.
Mr Nadir last month jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail and fled to northern Cyprus.
Mr Rogerson said yesterday that he had approached Mr Mates, a minister in
the Northern Ireland office, because he had understood that Mr Mates was a
'good MP'.
Mr Rogerson and his partner, Mr Christopher Morgan, are convinced that Mr
Nadir has received unjust treatment from the British legal system since he
was charged in December 1990 with theft and false accounting.
Mr Morgan has known Mr Mates for several years. Mr Rogerson said yesterday
that he had never met Mr Mates before talking to him about Mr Nadir.
The first meeting between Mr Mates and Mr Rogerson took place 18 months ago
and there have been several subsequent meetings.
Mr Mates has also discussed the Serious Fraud Office's handling of Mr
Nadir's case with Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, Mr Nadir's defence counsel.
Mr Scrivener said yesterday that he could not recall any reference to an
introduction by a constituent when Mr Mates approached him.
In his statement on Monday Mr Mates said that 'a constituent who was one of
Nadir's advisers' contacted him about 18 months ago 'raising certain
matters' about the SFO's handling of the case and the delay in bringing it
to court.
Mr Mates has said that he subsequently had meetings with the
attorney-general and there had been 'an exchange of correspondence' on the
subject, throughout which he had been 'consulted and advised ' by Mr
Scrivener.
Mr Scrivener said he could not recall the first time he had been approached
by Mr Mates other than it was 'possibly' before the last election.
He said: 'Mr Mates was very heated (about the SFO treatment) . . . I don't
know about a constituent . . . Mr Mates appeared out of the blue.'
Mr Scrivener defended Mr Mates's action, which he described as the
'absolutely correct action' by an MP on the side of justice.
Mr Mates received the support of a colleague in the Northern Ireland office
yesterday when Mr Robert Atkins, a junior minister, said that the matter was
not one that required Mr Mates's resignation, and that he was sure his
colleague would come through the affair 'with flying colours'.
Some other Conservative MPs were less supportive, however, and said that the
connection with Mr Nadir put a question mark over Mr Mates's judgment.
The minister's statement, in which he said he had acted on behalf of a
constituent and that he had given a watch to Mr Nadir as a light-hearted
gift, has so far failed to silence his critics.
Labour MPs have already said that they intend to increase the pressure on Mr
John Major to investigate Mr Mates's actions in connection with Mr Nadir
when the Commons returns next week.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Air pollution is on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR POLLUTION has been worsening recently, although levels are generally
better than a decade ago, details in the Department of the Environment's
15th annual digest of environmental statistics show.
The UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to global warming, were
3 per cent higher in 1991 than in 1990, although they have fallen by a fifth
in the past decade. Environmentalists fear the recent rise could jeopardise
Britain's ability to meet international targets on global warming.
Rising transport levels emerge as one of the worst environmental problems.
Traffic emissions of nitrogen oxide rose by 73 per cent between 1981 and
1991, and emissions of black smoke by 86 per cent. The report adds: 'Poor
air quality was recorded at all urban monitoring sites in 1991.'
People are also increasingly concerned about noise. Complaints in England
and Wales rose by 40 per cent in the year to March 1991 compared with the
previous year. Scotland saw a rise of 8 per cent.
There are some improvements, however. Sulphur dioxide emissions from
industry have fallen during the decade and the UK consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), implicated in damage to the ozone layer of the
atmosphere, is sharply down.
Recycling schemes have also won increasing support. Aluminium can recycling
has risen to 0.2kg per person last year, a tenfold increase in the three
years since the start of the national scheme.
Recycling of steel cans rose in the same period from 0.82kg per person to
1.43kg.
The number of UK beaches complying with European Community bacteria
standards rose by 3.4 per cent to 328 last year, according to the National
River Authority's annual report on bathing water, published yesterday.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Heads in attack on league tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Association of Head Teachers yesterday set out its strong
opposition to the government's planned league tables of school performance,
on the eve of a speech to its annual conference by Mr John Patten, the
education secretary,
Mr David Hart, general secretary, said when opening the conference in
Newcastle, that headteachers in England and Wales would continue to object
to 'unfair and misleading' national league tables, even if the government
decided to reform the national curriculum tests on which they were based.
Mr Hart said: 'We are opposed to league tables and the position is not just
for this year . . . We would be opposed to league tables even if the tests
had been reformed next year so that they were satisfactory. We are opposed
to league tables pure and simple.'
This afternoon delegates will debate a motion calling on Mr Patten to
'abandon any plans to press ahead with publication on a school by school
basis'.
An alternative motion 'deplores the league table mentality which has arisen
to provide parents and the media with lists of meaningless examination
statistics and attendance figures'.
Mr Hart said he was under 'enormous pressure' from his members to withhold
results from local education authorities, and reveal them only to pupils,
parents and governors.
'It is outrageous that any government should seriously contemplate league
tables for seven-year-olds,' said Mr Hart, adding that few heads were in
favour of league tables for 11, 14, or 16-year-olds, including GCSE, A and
AS level results.
The three largest teachers' unions are refusing to implement the tests,
which are due to start in secondary schools in England and Wales next week.
The NAHT has called for them to be made voluntary.
He said raw results published in league tables failed to account for a
school's overall performance, the nature of the local community, the needs
of pupils and available resources.
National monitoring of school standards could be achieved by sampling
examination performances, he said.

FT  02 JUN 93 / DTI inquiry into failed defence firm costs Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's report into Astra, the defence
company which went into receivership last year, has been completed at a cost
of Pounds 2.1m.
Some witnesses have complained the time taken to complete the inquiry -
three years after the inspectors were appointed - has adversely affected
their careers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said in a letter to one of the
witnesses that the timetable might have been affected by factors outside the
inspectors' control, including 'the failure of some witnesses to attend or
delays in providing information'.
The first draft of the report was sent to up to 25 witnesses last summer and
contained criticisms of former Astra directors and its former auditors, Stoy
Hayward.
In a move believed to have resulted from the DTI inquiry, Mr Paul Smith, a
corporate finance partner who worked on the Astra account at Stoy Hayward,
is now to spend most of his time on internal computer projects.
Mr Philip Rusted, an audit partner working on the account, left the firm in
March last year.
The first draft also examined the role of advisers to the Pounds 36m rights
issue in July 1989: Paine Webber International, the merchant bank, Hitchens,
Harrison &amp; Co, Astra's stockbrokers, and Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett, its
solicitors. Those criticised have had an opportunity to comment, although
objections were still being submitted when the DTI received the final report
last month.
It is still not clear whether the final report will be published.
Astra's accounts showed a provision of Pounds 1m to pay for the report. The
total cost is likely to be borne in part by the taxpayer.

FT  02 JUN 93 / High street banks cut private-sector loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROLONGED recession, loan write-offs and increased caution about the risks
of lending contributed to a Pounds 4.8bn fall in lending by the big high
street banks to private-sector companies last year, it emerged yesterday.
The British Bankers' Association disclosed in its annual abstract that the
loans outstanding to industrial and commercial companies totalled Pounds
65.6bn at the end of December, compared with Pounds 70.4bn at the same time
in 1991.
The lending by the banks - Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, Barclays,
Lloyds, Midland, National Westminster, Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of
Scotland and TSB Group - was largely reduced through a fall in overdrafts.
Overdrafts to industrial and commercial companies fell by Pounds 3.8bn to
Pounds 23.6bn. The fall in lending to private-sector companies came despite
an increase in lending to individuals and households from Pounds 117.5bn in
1991 to Pounds 123.6bn last year.
The BBA said the fall in lending reflected 'serious attempts' by
private-sector companies to reduce their indebtedness, both by running down
their deposits and by transferring debt into equity.
The high street banks - which account for 70 per cent of British sterling
lending - also closed some 700 branches and cut 18,500 staff as they
struggled to cut over-capacity in their branch and distribution networks.
The BBA disclosed that the banks cut the total number of branches by 5.7 per
cent and the total number of staff by 5.6 per cent during 1992. The cuts in
the banks' 11,600-branch network have been continuing this year and are
expected to last at least until 1995.
The report said that lending figures had been distorted by loan write-offs
totalling Pounds 4.5bn. Most of the write-offs were on troubled loans to
property, construction and manufacturing companies.
The banks increased the share of their lending allocated to mortgages.
House-purchase loans increased to 33.2 per cent of total sterling lending of
Pounds 272.5bn, compared with 31.3 per cent of total lending of Pounds
268.2bn in 1991.
They also achieved a substantial increase in their share of the mortgage
market. While net lending for house purchases from building societies fell
to Pounds 13.7bn last year from Pounds 20.9bn in 1991, that of banks rose to
Pounds 5.9bn from Pounds 4.7bn.
The fall in the number of bank branches was partly offset by an increase of
600 in the number of automated teller machines in high streets. Total cash
withdrawn from the 15,000 bank cash machines rose 8.6 per cent.
The average credit outstanding on Mastercard and Visa credit cards continued
to rise, from Pounds 407 in 1991 to Pounds 419 last year, although it grew
more slowly than in previous years.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Labour takes over county council body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR HAS won overall control of the Association of County Councils for the
first time in the organisation's 104-year history.
The development - which follows the Conservatives' disastrous showing in
last month's county council elections when they lost control of all but one
of the 20 counties they were defending - intensifies the difficulties facing
Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, in his dealings with local
government.
Labour's majority was assured yesterday when a selection panel at hung
Cheshire county council gave the party two seats on the ACC executive, with
one each for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. This ensures the party of
an overall majority of five seats on the ACC's executive council. The
Conservatives are now the ACC's third-largest party.
This puts Labour in charge of three of the four main representative bodies
for local government in mainland Britain. The Association of Metropolitan
Authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are Labour
controlled, while the Association of District Councils remains under a
minority Tory leadership.
Mrs Josie Farrington, the ACC Labour group leader, played down the
possibility of confrontation with the government.
She said: 'It's not really appropriate in an association to talk about
taking control. Obviously we will be speaking up for the interests of people
who use local government services, and we would do that collectively with
all those who want to make a case to gov-ernment in a reasonable way.'
Labour's strength on the ACC was boosted last week by a decision of
Labour-controlled Derbyshire county council to rejoin the association after
a 12-year gap, giving the party an extra three seats.
Derbyshire's and Cheshire's decisions, with the reappointment of three
Labour representatives from South Glamorgan county council, will bring
Labour strength on the 182-seat ACC executive to 93.
The Liberal Democrats will have 48 seats, Conservatives 31 and independents
9, with one vacancy - giving Labour an overall majority of five seats.
Before the county elections the Tories controlled the ACC with 91 of its
then 178 seats, to Labour's 61, the Liberal Democrats' 16, and independents'
10.

FT  02 JUN 93 / President ousted in Guatemala amid celebration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Jorge Serrano of Guatemala was ousted yesterday by a combination
of military and opposition leaders.
General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, defence minister, took over temporarily
but a government communique later said Vice-President Gustavo Espina
Salguero would assume presidential duties until a new election. It also said
Congress and the Supreme Court would remain dissolved.
Congressman Fernando Linares Beltranena and other congressmen said the
military was meeting legislators to prepare for an extraordinary session of
Congress today and to elect a provisional successor. But, after the
communique, it was not clear whether the session would occur.
Mr Linares said that, although Gen Garca had taken charge, he believed the
military 'wants to keep aloof' and that there would be a civilian successor
to Mr Serrano.
The presidency in a general's hands could mean a return to the full military
rule which Guatemala knows well.
A government statement said the president's departure had arisen from a
consensus but Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan indigenous leader who won
the Nobel Peace Prize last year, called it a military coup 'with a civilian
facade' and walked out of talks about the succession. A group of union
leaders went with her.
Early yesterday members of Guatemala's Congress were summoned to the
presidential palace. Hundreds of people outside the palace were shouting
pro-democracy slogans as the Congress members began to arrive. 'Serrano has
fallen, Serrano has fallen,' they cheered as they let off fireworks.
The Mexican television station ECO reported from Guatemala City that Gen
Garca had asked Mr Serrano, who snatched authoritarian powers last week when
he suspended Congress and the Supreme Court, to step down. Business and
labour groups were also pressing for the president to quit and there had
been much unrest in Guatemala City during the past week over declining
living standards.
Business had jitters about losing trading benefits under the generalised
system of preferences - a possibility raised by the US State Department -
which could affect Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of exports. The US, the
European Community and Japan blocked tens of millions of dollars in aid to
Guatemala.
Mr Serrano was elected in 1990 to a five-year term which he began in January
1991.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Clinton in firing line over future of nuclear testing: A
moratorium expiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of nuclear testing are preparing for a last-minute battle to win
over President Bill Clinton as he nears a decision on whether to resume test
explosions when a nine-month moratorium expires on July 1.
Senior US officials, backed by the UK government, have made a preliminary
recommendation for a resumption of testing but President Clinton is under
strong pressure from leading members of Congress - both Republicans and
Democrats - to extend the moratorium.
Under the terms of a law passed by Congress last year, against the
opposition of then President George Bush, the US may make up to 15
underground tests to improve the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons
over the next three years.
Nuclear tests would be completely banned thereafter, unless another country
conducts its own tests.
The administration has abandoned any thought of challenging the full ban
from 1996 onwards, but the decision on whether to resume testing over the
next three years appears to be more finely balanced.
While the US Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories
enthusiastically favour a resumption of tests - and the arms control and
disarmament agency, an autonomous agency within the US government, argues
keenly against - the Pentagon and the State Department are less forthright.
The disagreements have already delayed any possible tests until much later
this year, because the legislation requires the president to give Congress
90 days' notice of his plans.
On the sidelines of the debate are the UK, which uses the US test site in
Nevada and is therefore in effect bound by Mr Clinton's decision, and
France, which started what has become almost a general moratorium by the
nuclear powers but is eager to resume tests at Mururoa, in the South
Pacific, to complete the modernisation of its nuclear arsenal.
Russia, which has not exploded a nuclear bomb since October 1990, is also
watching; it would like to continue the moratorium but says it will align
itself on the policy adopted by the other nuclear powers - although it no
longer has access to the test site in Kazakhstan.
China has not signed the moratorium; it detonated a nuclear bomb estimated
at one megaton last May, and is reported to be preparing another 150-kiloton
test.
The Senate coalition against the resumption of testing is particularly
muscular, being led by Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority
leader, Senator James Exon, a senior Democrat from Nebraska, and Senator
Mark Hatfield, top Republican on the crucial spending committee.
Test opponents have been encouraged by some of Mr Clinton's remarks to them
in recent weeks, and are pressing for a full meeting to discuss the issue.
Those who advocate more tests say more work is needed on missile safety,
particularly for the Trident II D-5 submarine-launched missile, which a
commission headed by Professor Sidney Drell of Stanford University said
posed a threat because its plutonium warhead core is surrounded by
vulnerable high-explosive and propellant.
Test opponents say that to stop now could save perhaps Dollars 30m to
Dollars 60m per test, and help Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who can
ill-afford the cost, to fend off the demands of his own military-industrial
establishment to resume testing.
What is most important, they argue, is that a resumption of nuclear testing
by the big powers would undercut efforts to win support for renewal of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is to expire in 1995, and could only
encourage countries such as North Korea and Iran to move ahead in their
attempts to acquire nuclear weapons technology.
'If we are testing when the NPT review conference meets, even if we are
negotiating a comprehensive test ban, there would be a perception of
cynicism by the superpowers,' says Mr Jack Mendelsohn of the Arms Control
Association, a Washington-based disarmament think tank.
If Mr Clinton does decide to go ahead with further tests, arms control
advocates are urging, as a fallback position, that testing should at least
be halted before the NPT review in 1995.

FT  02 JUN 93 / US growth picks up after pause: Purchasing index shows weak
expansion in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US purchasing managers' index climbed back above 50 per cent last month,
indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding weakly after a pause
in April.
Separate official data for personal incomes and construction spending,
however, showed no rise in April relative to March.
The latest figures are consistent with consensus forecasts of a modest
economic rebound in the second quarter, after weaker-than-expected growth at
an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent in the first period.
The first quarter's weakness was partly due to a sharp decline in net
exports, which reduced the growth rate by nearly two percentage points. The
rapid increase in imports in the opening period is expected to slow down in
the current quarter, greatly reducing the drag from a poor trading
performance.
The purchasing managers' index rose to 51.1 per cent last month, against
49.7 per cent in April, but remained well below its average level in the
first quarter. A reading above 50 per cent generally indicates that the
manufacturing sector is expanding.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said the latest survey
pointed to lower inflationary pressures and a modest rise in industrial
orders. The level of order books, however, was not yet sufficient to support
a vigorous expansion of production.
Most components of the index were mildly encouraging. The index for
production rose from 51.8 to 55.8 per cent and the new orders index climbed
from 51.1 to 53.5 per cent. However, the employment index fell to 43.4 per
cent, its lowest level since January 1992, suggesting that prospects for
manufacturing employment remain dismal.
The Commerce Department said personal incomes stagnated in April, after
rising for the previous four months. Consumers, however, dipped into savings
and increased cash spending by 1 per cent relative to March.
Officials said the income figures were distorted by a fall in farm subsidies
and by a rebound in rental incomes that had been depressed by winter storms
in March. The underlying trend was for a gradual rise in personal incomes,
but not at a rate to support rapid growth of consumer spending.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Unlikely coalition weakens Serrano hold on power

SUPPORT for President Jorge Serrano of Guatemala appeared to be dwindling
yesterday as he failed to clamp down on growing public opposition after
snatching authoritarian powers last week.
The president's action has brought together an unlikely coalition aimed at
forcing him to stand down. Some opposition groups have begun positioning
themselves for events after his departure.
Mr Serrano has been dealt a severe blow by the president of the supreme
electoral tribunal, Mr Arturo Herbruger, who rejected his request to call
elections for a constituent assembly.
'Any electoral consultations must be realised under full guarantees. While
the constitution is entirely or partially suspended, there cannot be
elections,' Mr Herbruger said. He is being talked of as a possible interim
president, as is Mr Edmund Mulet, ambassador to Washington and a former
chairman of Congress who was first among a number of ambassadors to resign
in protest at Mr Serrano's move.
The influential private sector umbrella group Cacis, which has supported
coups in Guatemala in the past, issued a statement calling on Mr Serrano to
back down. The business community has become jittery about the possibility
of losing trading benefits under the generalised system of preferences - a
possibility raised by the US State Department - which could affect Dollars
200m (Pounds 129.8m) of exports.
A delegation from the Organisation of American States led by Mr Joao Baena
Soares, secretary-general, met Mr Serrano on Sunday to urge him to reinstate
the constitution. OAS foreign ministers are to meet in Washington tomorrow
to discuss action against the government.
General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, minister of defence, who initially
supported the move, failed to give explicit backing to Mr Serrano after
senior military officers had met the president on Sunday. He said the army
was concerned by the international condemnation of Guatemala.
On Monday, the afternoon daily newspaper La Hora circulated on the streets
uncensored after the police had withdrawn their cordon around its offices.
The morning daily Siglo XXI blackened its front page and left its national
pages blank as a protest against government censorship.
A bomb went off at the newspaper's office yesterday, while another exploded
at the offices of the weekly Cronico.

<TEXT>
ECUADOR is expected to secure soon a Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) stand-by
loan from the International Monetary Fund, a letter of intent having been
signed last week.
The letter fixes the government's macro-economic objectives in a two-year
adjustment plan and forecasts growth of 2.5-3 per cent this year.
The government has also pledged to reduce its fiscal deficit and to cut
inflation to an annual 30 per cent from last year's 50 per cent.
The preliminary accord with the IMF comes after several failed attempts to
renegotiate Dollars 6.5bn of commercial debt with creditor banks.
It is hoped the IMF deal will instil confidence among creditors and foreign
investors who have been hesitant to take advantage of Ecuador's
liberalisation of foreign investment regulations.
The government has pushed through Congress a law to regulate and revitalise
the stock market. Tax incentives are offered to draw more companies to the
market, while stricter regulations require companies to provide buyers with
more financial information.
The adjustment plan has been criticised for its lack of social provision for
the 50 per cent of Ecuador's population living in extreme poverty.
Fearing that modernisation will cost them their jobs, workers staged a
two-day national general strike last week. Increases in electricity and
telephone rates have also provoked widespread discontent.

<TEXT>
SOUTH African politicians last night battled to keep the constitutional
negotiating process on track as negotiators finally began to discuss
fundamental issues such as the process for writing a new constitution.
Negotiators acknowledged that they had failed to achieve sufficient progress
on constitutional issues to announce a firm date for the first multi-racial
elections tomorrow, as had been expected. They postponed a meeting of the
208-member negotiating forum, charged with announcing a date, until 25 June.
But they held out hopes that a target election date could be announced
instead, with the date to be finalised only once agreement had been reached
on a constitution under which elections could be held.
The government and the ANC are keen to announce a date by their self-imposed
deadline of tomorrow - even if it is just a target date - to avoid a
threatened outbreak of mass action and violence.
The ANC's youth leader, Mr Peter Mokaba, had threatened that black
youngsters would make the country ungovernable unless an election date was
set by Thursday.
Negotiators from the 26 parties represented at the multi-party forum
yesterday took a step towards narrowing the differences between them on
constitutional issues when the Inkatha Freedom Party agreed in principle to
accept an elected constituent assembly to draft a final constitution.
This represents a fundamental shift in the negotiating position of Inkatha;
but final agreement will be conditional on agreement to grant significant
powers to regional government under a new constitution. Negotiators are due
to discuss this issue, the crux of the constitutional problem, tomorrow.
The ANC also made a significant concession, agreeing that the powers of
regional governments should be agreed by the 26-party forum rather than an
elected assembly. This process is likely to favour the interests of Inkatha.
Meanwhile, negotiators faced further delays over the issue of whether the
Pan Africanist Congress should be excluded from the talks. Government
insists that the PAC should be ejected from the talks because it has refused
to abandon its armed struggle.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Sharif offers an olive branch to the opposition
</HEADLINE>

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, restored to power by the
Supreme court last Wednesday, has intensified his efforts to establish
political peace.
Mr Sharif began a new campaign this week when he extended an olive branch to
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, offering to end all past
rivalries. Such a gesture was inconceivable even three months ago in view of
their intense, bitter and acrimonious rivalry.
In a speech to a special session of parliament, Mr Sharif turned to Ms
Bhutto and said, 'let us sit across the table to discuss the issues facing
the country and to end confrontation between the government and the
opposition.'
While indirectly accusing Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the President who sacked his
government, for encouraging government-opposition rifts, Mr Sharif
immediately set up a three member ministerial committee to hold discussions
with opposition leaders.
In response Ms Bhutto said, 'I have nothing personally against you, and if
you want to remove this tension and acrimony I fully support you.' She is
expected to demand fresh elections, withdrawal of court cases against
herself and other opposition leaders, and assurances that her supporters
will not be victimised.
The latest offer from the government is seen as an important sign of
flexibility in the Sharif camp, which could lay the foundation for a more
tolerant political environment.
But Mr Sharif remains under pressure after two of the four provincial
assemblies have been dissolved since last Friday, widely seen as a move from
the president's camp to intensify pressure on Mr Sharif's federal
government.
Despite Mr Sharif's latest gesture to the opposition, it is also not clear
if his latest efforts to establish a government-opposition working
relationship will in fact be successful. That is especially so, because the
opposition's demand for fresh elections is unlikely to be accepted by the
Sharif camp.
Some officials expect a final compromise to emerge on the basis of
ministerial slots being given to members of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PDA
(People's Democratic Alliance), in the federal government as well as the
Southern province of Sindh.
However, the end result of the government-opposition negotiations could be
different from expectations before discussions actually begin.
Mr Sharif's latest political troubles have become more complex due to the
country's economic problems. Pakistan's annual budget which is likely to be
announced within the next two weeks, is widely expected to close the current
fiscal year with one of the largest deficits in the country's history.
The political uncertainty has only made it more difficult for the government
to introduce new revenue raising measures such as increase in gas and
electricity tariffs, fearing public unrest, senior officials say.

FT  02 JUN 93 / The rush through China's most open door: The headiness and
the headaches of an investor-friendly boomtown in south China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is one place in the province of Guangdong that symbolises both the
successes and pitfalls of China's new economic policies it is Dongguan, a
city of nearly 1.4m people on the western reaches of the Pearl River estuary
between Hong Kong to the south and Guangzhou to the north.
In many respects Dongguan is a shining example of Deng Xiaoping's 'opening
to the outside world'. There are more than 10,000 companies in the city that
depend on foreign capital for their existence, or are partly or fully
foreign-owned.
Since the watershed year 1978, when China turned its back on autarky and
embraced 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', foreigners have invested
nearly USDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in textiles, consumer electronics, food
products and much else in Dongguan.
Over the past 14 years the city has achieved an annual average rate of
growth of 20 per cent - outstripping the provincial and national averages
comfortably.
As Mr Yang Xiaotang, a foreign investment official with the Dongguan
municipality says: 'The economic growth of Dongguan has been mainly due to
foreign investment; without it, we would not have grown.'
Dongguan set out to be a business-friendly location for foreign investors
from the beginning, and to tap the far-flung Chinese diaspora. What is
fortunate for Dongguan is that it is not that far flung.
Of the estimated 850,000 overseas Chinese who can trace their ancestral
homes to one of the 29 towns and 582 administrative districts of the city,
some 650,000 live in Hong Kong or Macao. Collectively they have been
responsible for about 80 per cent of 'foreign' investment in the city.
Investors have brought to Dongguan capital and expertise and they have
gravitated to the once rural city and environs because of a particularly
enlightened Communist Party leadership. Under the rubric of 'honouring
contracts and keeping promises' it has convinced some foreign investors,
whose first experience of investing in China may have been anything but
positive, that business success can be achieved on the mainland.
One example is Vtech, a London-listed but Hong Kong-managed consumer
electronics, computers and mobile telephone manufacturer. It first invested
in Shenzhen, in the early 1980s but found that the local Communist party and
government apparatus wanted too much control over the factory. It moved a
few miles north to Dongguan and today, after a cumulative investment of
HKDollars 700m (Pounds 59m), employs 8,000 permanent workers.
'We told them that we wanted to run the factory ourselves and we wanted to
do the administration,' says Mr Joseph Tam, the Hong Kong manager. 'They
agreed. We are also free to recruit any person we like and fire them if they
do not meet our requirements.'
The local government receives a steady income from Vtech. In addition to a
HKDollars 30 a worker monthly fee it receives the hard currency - a
percentage of which it shares with the central government - associated with
Vtech's exports which amounted to nearly Yn3bn (Pounds 337m).
This access to hard currency has allowed the city to develop some of the
best roads in China and an advanced telecommunications systems. In spite of
a big effort to develop the local electric power industry, power shortages
are a frequent occurrence, especially for households, and most companies and
small businesses have their own standby power generation facilities.
Although Dongguan has been successful in its supply side reforms, it is a
prisoner of the lack of macro-economic policy coherence in China.
In Dongguan, as elsewhere in the Pearl River delta, rapid industrialisation,
speculative property investment, tight labour markets and the gradual
relaxation of exchange controls for the yuan are unleashing destabilising
inflationary forces and it is far from clear if the Chinese authorities have
the means to control it.
According to Mr Marc Dreyer, general manager of Nestle Dongguan, a joint
venture manufacturing instant coffee and powdered whitener for the domestic
Chinese market, pay and employment is the biggest issue facing managers.
'You have to reassess pay levels regularly,' he says. 'It is the biggest
issue facing managers of joint ventures in China and you have to do it
without any real reference points.'
Mr Tam of Vtech, however, has a most unwelcome reference point. Across the
road from Vtech's factory is a new installation assembling colour television
sets.
Recently it posted a sign offering any Vtech employee a promotion and 20 per
cent more than they were earning. In March this year Vtech increased wages
20 per cent and, says Mr Tam, it expects to have to increase wages by a
further 20 per cent soon.
'If we don't increase wages they will all cross the road,' says Mr Tam.
Some investors are having to pay their employees in Hong Kong dollars to
retain them. One businessman brings the cash with him in a suitcase. It is
risky, he concedes, but his workforce has lost confidence in the yuan.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Japan renews attack on US over yen rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday renewed its criticisms of US policy on
trade and exchange rates as the yen rose to a record high of Y107 to the
dollar in Tokyo.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, criticised the US for linking its
aim to reduce the US trade deficit with an appreciation of the yen.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade and industry minister, warned the US that yen's
rise threatened to choke Japanese growth.
Their comments indicate the difficulties Japan has faced in co-ordinating
international moves to stem the yen's advance.
The renewed friction over the rise also casts doubts on the substance of the
communique issued after an April meeting of finance ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) industrialised countries which called for exchange rate
stability.
The Japanese authorities are keen to deflect criticism from exporters hit by
the yen's rise by blaming the Clinton administration for talking up the yen.
The US dollar has lost about 3 per cent of its value against the yen in the
last week in the wake of a US treasury department report which suggested a
yen appreciation might reduce the Japanese trade surplus.
The government has been powerless to stem the yen's rise from about Y125 at
the turn of the year despite repeated interventions by the Bank of Japan.
It is thought the Bank of Japan has bought more than Dollars 10bn in the
foreign exchange market since April in an attempt to cap the yen. Japan's
foreign reserves increased by Dollars 2.53bn in May from the month before to
Dollars 79.46bn, according to finance ministry figures published yesterday.
The economic planning agency warned that the yen's rise might stall the
timid economic recovery expected in the late autumn on the basis of the
official index of leading indicators.
The March index stood at 79.2 per cent, the third consecutive month in which
it has been above 50 per cent. Readings above 50 per cent are taken as a
leading indicator of growth between three and six months ahead.
EPA officials warned the recent rise in the index might be because of a
temporary surge in business activity before the end of the 1992 financial
year.
Automobile sales in May were 12.9 per cent down on the same month last year.
It was the second consecutive fall after a 1.7 per cent rise in sales in
March had promoted optimism that a sales recovery was starting.

<TEXT>
THE Australian dollar fell to a record low of 49.1 on the Reserve Bank's
trade weighted index (TWI) yesterday after government figures showed that
economic growth has stagnated at the lower end of official forecasts.
The statistics bureau said that the average measure of gross domestic
product grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, following revised growth
of one per cent in the three months to December. The figures indicate that
the Australian economy is growing at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent, the
lower end of the government's 2.5-3 per cent target.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, had earlier forecast 4 per cent growth.
Confirmation of the moderate rate of growth fuelled unease in financial
markets following the release on Monday of a worse than expected current
account deficit for April. The Australian dollar closed at 67.45 US cents in
Sydney from 67.68 cents on Monday, when it fell 1.5 cents in response to the
poor current account figures and at Y71.97 against the yen from Y72.38.
On the TWI, the dollar fell from 49.4 on Monday to 49.1, below the previous
low of 49.3 recorded in 1986 after Mr Keating, the then treasurer, warned
that Australia faced a 'banana republic' debt crisis.
The poor economic indicators suggest that the government will face serious
constraints in fulfilling election promises to achieve a significant
reduction in unemployment, currently 10.7 per cent. Standard and Poor's, the
international credit rating agency, said Australia's current account deficit
was 'a major concern', and warned that faster economic growth would cause
'inevitable balance of payments pressures'.
The agency said the current account deficit reinforced concerns about the
impact of the government's growing budget deficit on demand for imports. The
budget deficit is forecast at ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7.23bn) this year and
ADollars 18bn in 1993/94, compared with ADollars 12bn last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economic downturn has made the country's tradition of lifetime
employment less reliable for the average salaried worker.
Figures released yesterday, however, suggest that Japanese company
presidents have not been shielded from the swing of the corporate axe
either.
A record 242 Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo stock exchange have
replaced their presidents since January, according to the Wako Research
Institute of Economics.
The figure exceeds the previous record of 238 companies for the whole of
1989. Wako expects this year's total to reach about 270.
Among prominent changes at the top were the resignation of Mr Akio Tanii,
former president of Matsushita, the electronics group.
Mr Tanii stepped down in February to take responsibility for a subsidiary's
involvement in a financial scandal and for the sale of defective
refrigerators by another subsidiary.
More recently, Mr Kuniyoshi Kosuge was forced to resign as president of
Isetan, a leading department store chain, ending rule by the founding
family.
Although Mr Kosuge was a member of the family, his management attracted much
internal criticism while Isetan has had difficulty improving its profits
performance.
The reasons behind the large number of resignations include old age, the
need to find a scapegoat for a company's poor results or for involvement in
a scandal, and to make it easier to introduce changes needed to return to
profitability, Wako said.
At the same time, Japanese companies have tended to replace presidents in
odd-numbered years, Wako added. The tendency stems from the two-year tenure
for executives which is common in Japan.
Among those which replaced their presidents, 48 per cent of companies chose
a new one from within the company while 42 per cent found someone from
outside, in many cases from a company within the same keiretsu, or corporate
grouping.
Often the replacement is not voluntary. Yamatane Securities, for example,
was obliged to accept a new president from Sakura Bank, which was supporting
it through a major restructuring.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Cambodian Elections: Moment of truth in Phnom Penh - UN is
resisting losers' call for poll rerun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE communist Cambodian government, trailing the royalist opposition in
preliminary results from the UN-organised election last week, has insisted
polling be held again in at least four provinces, and has threatened to
reject the results if its demands are not met.
Officials of the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) have produced several
unsubstantiated reports of electoral 'irregularities' and issued veiled
warnings to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) that the
government might resort to violence to press its demands.
'We get many indications that there might be some insurrection or riot, and
we fear that the situation might get out of control,' Mr Khieu Kanharith,
the government spokesman, told a news conference yesterday.
In a meeting with diplomats from countries which supported the 1991 Paris
peace accords and the election, other government officials said they might
not be able to restrain army officers from acting without authority.
The government wants new elections in Phnom Penh, Battambang, Kompong
Chhnang and Prey Veng.
Untac, although disturbed by the government's threats, said it had no plans
to hold the elections again without proof that there had been
irregularities. The UN has increased security at Untac's popular radio
station, accused of bias by the government, and installed heavy machine
guns.
'I don't believe that the predictions of unrest have any basis,' said Mr
Yasushi Akashi, who heads Untac's Dollars 2bn mission to bring peace and
democracy to Cambodia. 'I hope the result of the elections will be
respected.'
With about two thirds of the votes counted, the royalist party Funcinpec
looks set to win more seats than the CPP in the new 120-seat assembly, which
is supposed to write a new constitution within three months and then give
birth to a new government.
Trying to maintain stability during the coming months, Untac is seeking an
unspecified sum of international financial aid to pay the government's
200,000 or so soldiers, policemen and militiamen, and to keep the rest of
the administration ticking over.
Government revenues have plunged in recent weeks because of corruption at
customs posts and because Chinese traders, reluctant to keep high levels of
stock in Cambodia, have cut imports.
The government is dismayed by the imminent loss of its monopoly of power and
evidently confused about how to react, prompting speculation that the ruling
CPP is divided on the issue.
'I think they are having some internal difficulties to convince these people
to accept these elections,' said Mr Akashi. 'It may not be easy.'
Early results from Kompong Cham, showing nearly a two-to-one lead in favour
of Funcinpec, are a particularly hard blow for the government. The province
accounts for 18 of the 120 assembly seats and is the home of Mr Hun Sen, the
prime minister; his brother is the provincial governor.
Official spokesmen yesterday veered between threatening to reject the
results completely and suggesting that objections are technical ones which
could be resolved with Untac.
Options for the government are limited. Denied international recognition
since it was installed by the Vietnamese invasion which overthrew the Khmer
Rouge in 1979, the CPP is unwilling to undergo a further 14 years of
isolation.
It is doubtful CPP leaders could mobilise genuine public demonstrations in
Phnom Penh, where again the vote was two-to-one in favour of Funcinpec. The
claims of irregularities and fraud are unconvincing. Also, army loyalty
cannot be guaranteed because many soldiers are paid late.
Funcinpec, meanwhile, continues to complain of government attacks on its
members. According to Funcinpec officials, a 57-year-old woman member of the
party and her son were murdered in Prey Veng province at the weekend.

China's inflation is being fuelled by sharp rises in the costs of
production, which will eventually be reflected in sharply higher consumer
prices, an official newspaper said, Reuter reports from Beijing. 'The rises
in the price for industrial products is too fierce . . . ,' the China
Commerce News said. It said the sharp price rises were driven by the
unprecedented increase in investment in fixed assets, which rose a
year-on-year 70.7 per cent in the first quarter. 'There is an acute demand
for production materials and prices for industrial products are going
upwards.'

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US Hispanic groups link Nafta support to
side deals
</HEADLINE>

KEY Hispanic groups in the US are making stringent side agreements, aimed at
protecting worker rights and the environment, a condition of their support
for the North American Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.
Several Hispanic leaders said last week that the Clinton administration also
had to present a 'blueprint' of a plan to retrain displaced workers before
they would give their support.
The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta, who counted on
Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress. But the US Hispanic
community is deeply divided over whether to endorse the agreement.
Mr Richard Lopez, an aide to the congressional Hispanic caucus, said last
week that differing opinion had prevented the group taking an official
position on Nafta.
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza, a civil rights
group, and the Southwest Voter Registration Project said they feared
Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta.
'The most competitive sectors on both sides of the border would win,' said
Prof Raul Hinojosa, of the University of California in Los Angeles and a
leader of the Southwest Voter Registration Project. 'Trade would produce job
growth on both sides of the border, but the question is how those jobs are
distributed.
'Those sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import penetration are
those sectors most dependent on recent immigration for their labour force.'
Fifteen Hispanic organisations, including La Raza, propose to set up a
trilateral North American Development Bank to direct resources to regions of
the US, Mexico and Canada most affected negatively by Nafta.
However, business organisations like the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and
the Hispanic Trade Council are enthusiastic backers of the deal.
Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared side
agreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights could
jeopardise Nafta. 'It's a giant opportunity we can't let go to waste,' he
said.
At the other end of the spectrum lies Mr Segundo Mercado-Llorens of the
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union who is vehemently
opposed to the current incarnation of Nafta. 'A vast majority of us
(Hispanics) will be losers unless there are fundamental changes in the
current Nafta,' he said.

THE Swiss government gave the go-ahead yesterday for a controversial sale of
60 turboprop trainer aircraft to South Africa, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The government said it was satisfied that technical changes to be made by
the manufacturer, the Pilatus subsidiary of the weapons and engineering
group Oerlikon Buhrle, would make it impossible to convert the aircraft for
combat use. The government also announced it would grant an export credit
guarantee to support the SFr250m (Pounds 110.1m) order.
Last December, when the order was announced, a UN Security Council committee
monitoring the mandatory UN arms embargo on South Africa said sale of the
PC-7 to South Africa would violate the spirit of the embargo. The Swiss
government then said it would not issue an export licence unless the
aircraft were modified so they could not be used for combat.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Investors move as Asia gets on the phone -
Opportunities abound as telecommunications catch up with region's economic
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A telecommunications revolution is sweeping the Asia-Pacific region. It is
not just new technology: the region's industry is being liberalised and
privatised at a pace breathtaking to observers of Europe's state-owned phone
monopolies.
Opportunities for overseas companies are manifold. Cable and Wireless, the
UK group, is exploring the ground for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) joint
venture to engineer a huge expansion of the Philippines' fixed-line system;
it already has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom, plus ventures in
Australia, Pakistan, Japan and Thailand.
Most of Asia-Pacific's economies outgrew their telephone systems years ago.
Governments now realise that only a massive injection of overseas expertise
and investment will give them the infrastructure they need to sustain
current growth rates.
'Over the next 20 years, the region will need about 500m telephone lines,
currently valued at Dollars 750bn,' according to Mr Arnold Djiwatampu, a
senior official of the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency.
With 60 per cent of the world's population, and more than a quarter of its
output, the region has barely 17 per cent of the world's telephone lines. If
line growth continues at the current rate of about 10 per cent a year, the
number of main lines would reach nearly 5 per 100 people by the year 2000,
more than doubling the current telephone facility and representing a total
investment of at least Dollars 60bn.
Mr Andrew Harrington, regional telecommunications analyst at Salomon
Brothers Hong Kong, says: 'Asia-Pacific's telecoms sector is about to become
a powerful magnet for investment funds both from established companies and
diversified investors. In the next three years alone, there will be total
equity flotations of around Dollars 10bn. Direct investment by international
telecoms companies is likely to match that figure.'
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong already have modern systems
and a high ratio of lines to population. The priority in those countries is
lower prices and more services through a variable combination of
privatisation of fixed-line networks, liberalisation, and rapid progress in
developing the mobile and value-added sectors.
Both Australia and New Zealand have licensed competitors to their former
state monopolies. Three years ago, New Zealand sold off 100 per cent of its
state carrier to a consortium led by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US;
C&amp;W has a 24.7 per cent stake in Optus, the main competitor to Telstra, the
former Australian monopoly carrier, with whom it is now working on the
Philippines feasibility study.
'A main thrust behind Australia's reforms was to make our industry more
competitive so that it has a sharper competitive edge in the region as a
whole,' says Mr Robin Davey, chairman of Austel, Australia's
telecommunications regulator.
Australian operators have responded on cue. 'Our ambition is to become a
premier regional carrier,' says Mr Peter Shore, managing director of
Telstra's international business division. The company has projects in eight
countries across the region.
'But,' says Mr Shore, 'as far as our industry is concerned, 'trade' is a
relatively new concept'. Debate about the best way to proceed - through
alliances with local carriers, by buying stakes in foreign companies or by
competing with them - is raging. Much will depend on the stance of
regulators, country by country.
Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are taking tentative steps down the
liberalisation road. Of the region's more advanced economies, only Singapore
is holding out against competition, though Singapore Telecom is keen to
exploit overseas opportunities and already has mobile and data
communications joint ventures in nine countries.
In Malaysia and the Philippines, full market competition has been encouraged
with the former monopolies subjected to tariff restrictions and strong
competitive pressures.
Indonesia and Thailand's governments place less emphasis on competition,
which is largely restricted to non-basic services. Instead, various forms of
private sector partnership with existing operators are being encouraged.
Pakistan is contemplating the sale overseas of a large slice of its
telecommunications corporation.
In Thailand, Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has stake in Thai
Telephone and Telecom, a private company, which has a 'build, operate and
transfer' (BOT) franchise to install 1m lines in the provinces. TelecomAsia,
a consortium in which Nynex, the US operator, holds a 15 per cent stake, has
a BOT franchise to build 2m lines in Bangkok.
India, which is looking to increase its number of lines from 7m to 20m by
2000, is also after joint ventures to boost investment. The equipment and
mobile markets have already been partly liberalised, and the fixed-line
network is expected to follow. The goal is to provide each of India's
570,000 villages with a public pay phone; at present only 100,000 have one.
In telecommunications as in other sectors, China is the land of dreams. Mr
Yan Xianzu, Beijing's vice-minister of posts and telecommunications, was
reported to have told the Asia Telecom trade show recently that China was
aiming to nearly double its telephone capacity over the next two years, and
is looking to install about 70m new lines by 2000.

FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC fails to ease Cairns Group fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Cook, Australian trade minister, yesterday called for the Cairns
Group of agricultural exporting countries to toughen its stand in the Gatt
global trade liberalisation talks.
His call followed high-level talks with the European Commission in Brussels,
during which he failed to receive assurances about early European
ratification of last year's US-EC Blair House accord on agricultural export
subsidies.
Australia, representing the 14-member Cairns Group, is worried that the
EC-US focus on reaching a substantial market access package in industrial
products and services risks delaying final agreement on agriculture.
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Cook suggested - in talks with Sir Leon Brittan,
EC trade commissioner, and Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner -
that the US, EC, Japan and Canada - the principal negotiators in the market
access talks - might be tempted to re-open Blair House in order to bridge
last-minute differences.
But, after the Brussels meetings, Mr Cook left the impression that the EC
was unable to give assurances either on the timetable for ratification of
Blair House or on the inviolability of the accord.
The Blair House agreement, which limited EC-US farm export subsidies, faces
severe criticism from France. However, the French government has signalled
it is ready to accept part of the transatlantic agreement covering oilseeds.
Mr Cook told reporters that Blair House was 'rock bottom' for the Cairns
Group in terms of an acceptable deal.
He added: 'I don't think the Commission was in a position to give me a
commitment (on Blair House) in advance. I don't think I will be returning to
the southern hemisphere thinking that all is sweet on agriculture.'
As a result, Mr Cook said, Australia would urge the Cairns Group to adopt a
tough message at its meeting in Bangkok on June 26-27, aimed at ensuring its
interests are heeded at the Group of Seven industrialised countries' meeting
in Tokyo on July 7-9.
The EC hopes to reach a broad agreement among the G7 on an across-the-board
market access package, using such a deal as a springboard for a
comprehensive Gatt agreement by mid-December, the deadline for the expiry of
fast-track negotiating authority for US President Bill Clinton.
At a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
in Paris today, Mr Cook will receive another account of progress among the
US, EC, Canada and Japan on the market access package.

Two Danish drivers and a local interpreter were killed, and four Danes
wounded, yesterday when artillery fire hit their UN relief convoy in
northern Bosnia, a UN spokesman said, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The 12-truck convoy, carrying food to the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj,
was unloading supplies when shells landed at the mouth of the tunnel on the
road south of Maglaj, said a Geneva spokesman of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees.
Meanwhile, the bodies of two Italians - reported to have been shot while
delivering food aid in central Bosnia on Saturday - were found yesterday. A
third Italian also thought to have been shot was still missing.
In Sarajevo, two shells landed on a football match, killing at least 11
people and wounding about 100. The players thought the pitch was safe as it
was surrounded by apartment buildings. One of the wounded said he was
convinced the target was deliberately chosen.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Clash in Belgrade after Cosic ousted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL turbulence in Belgrade boiled over into violence yesterday as
police fired tear gas at demonstrators trying to storm the federal Yugoslav
parliament.
The clash follows the ousting of federal President Dobrica Cosic through a
no-confidence motion brought by radical Serbian deputies backed by the
ruling Serbian Socialists. His departure has raised doubts about political
stability in the rump Yugoslavia, which consists just of Serbia and
Montenegro.
Up to 4,000 demonstrators were brought on to the streets by the head of the
opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, Mr Vuk Draskovic. Chanting 'Rise up,
Belgrade', they smashed windows in the parliament building and tried to
break in. Police wielding truncheons moved into the crowd, who threw stones
at them, and police responded with tear gas.
Mr Draskovic earlier called on his followers to prepare for combat. His call
came after one of his deputies was knocked unconscious with a single punch
by a radical Serb deputy outside the chamber, in the fraught aftermath of
the vote against the federal president.
Mr Cosic was voted out after being accused of holding a secret meeting with
Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's constitutional future. The
head of the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical Party, Mr Vojislav Seselj, also
claimed Mr Cosic had held secret talks with Croatia over the Serb-held
region of Krajina, and was willing to carve up the Serb province of Kosovo -
where 90 per cent of people are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring
Albania.
Political analysts said that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the socialist president
of Serbia, appeared to have sacrificed Mr Cosic, once a close political
ally, in the hope of ensuring his own survival in a no-confidence vote later
this month in the Serb parliament. Without the support of hard-line Serb
deputies, his minority socialist government, accused of failing to address a
disastrous economic situation, could be toppled.
Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a
fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, by adopting a more
conciliatory position.
Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's
border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to stop Bosnian Serbs getting fuel
and weapons via Serbia. But Serbian petrol tankers still rumble over the
bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a
result of ousting Mr Cosic. Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in
favour of Mr Cosic during the debate. The Montenegrin government, already
resentful because UN sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than
that of Serbia, is taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it
is willing to accept UN monitors along its border with Bosnia.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Swedish state takes on property role: Government set to
pursue bank rescues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH state is set to become one of Europe's biggest commercial
property players because of the loan crisis that damaged the country's
banking sector last year.
Bank and government officials say the state may soon rank as high as
Europe's 10th largest property company if it takes over banks' property loan
portfolios worth up to SKr70bn (Pounds 6.2bn).
'The government is certainly going to play a role in the commercial property
market for the next decade,' said Mr Stefan Ingves, director-general of the
bank support authority, the body set up to handle the banking emergency.
Lending to the property sector in the late 1980s, which later turned bad as
property prices slumped especially in Sweden and the UK, was a prime cause
of the crisis which saw Sweden's main commercial banks return unprecedented
losses in 1992.
As part of its still uncompleted rescue operation, which has to date cost
SKr67.5bn in cash, loans and guarantees, the government now owns two of the
five biggest banks, Nordbanken and Gotabank.
To help launder their balance sheets and prepare them for eventual
re-privatisation, the bank support authority is hiving off into legally
separate 'bad banks' their problem assets, many of which are in property.
Gotabank has not yet decided which of its non-performing assets will go into
its 'bad bank', but property accounts for some SKr25bn of the bank's Skr40bn
of problem loans and credits.
The process is furthest advanced at Nordbanken, which has dumped assets
totalling Skr67bn into Securum, a new state-run agency. These assets include
2,450 properties in Sweden and 550 overseas, which together represent
Skr40-45bn in outstanding loans.
The foreign properties include 158 in Britain, representing SKr5.2bn in
credits, 80 in the Netherlands (SKr1.7bn), 60 in Germany (Skr3.4bn) and 50
in Belgium (Skr1.0bn). Securum officials say the agency is likely to end up
directly owning properties worth around SKr20bn. Gotabank estimates it, or
its 'bad bank', will end up owning property worth SKr8-10bn.
In Sweden, the government intends to manage the former Nordbanken and
Gotabank property assets separately and avoid 'firesale' disposals to try to
stabilise the local property market. Subsidiary companies in the UK and
Amsterdam will manage and dispose of the UK and continental European
properties.
A Securum spokesman pointed out that the agency's ultimate aim is to deal
itself out of the market, and not become a long-term player. 'We are not
going to become some sort of monster in the market. We are very large in
terms of volume, but our real estate is spread very widely and it is not the
best property around. If it was, we wouldn't have it in our hands.'

YUGOSLAVIA'S President Dobrica Cosic has been forced out of office by the
federal parliament, through a no-confidence motion brought by radical
Serbian deputies.
The sudden departure of Mr Cosic, accused in the chamber of having held a
secret meeting with Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's
constitutional future, raises fresh doubts about political stability in the
rump state of Yugoslavia, which consists of just Serbia and Montenegro.
In a vote early yesterday, rushed through at the final session of parliament
before the summer recess, deputies from the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical
Party, headed by Mr Vojislav Seselj, were backed by the ruling Serbian
Socialist Party of President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Seselj claimed in parliament that the federal president had also held
secret negotiations with Croatia over the Serb-held region of Krajina, and
was willing to carve up the Serbian province of Kosovo - where 90 per cent
of the population are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring Albania.
Mr Cosic, a leading Serbian writer who used to promote the idea of a Greater
Serbia, was not present in parliament to defend himself. He did not issue
any statement after the vote.
Political analysts said that Mr Milosevic appeared to have sacrificed Mr
Cosic, once a close political ally, in the hope of ensuring his government's
survival in another no-confidence vote, due to be held this month by the
Serbian parliament.
Without the support of hardline Serbian deputies, the minority socialist
government, accused of failing to address a disastrous economic situation,
could be toppled.
Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a
fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, and from other
extremists, by adopting a more conciliatory position.
Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's
border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to prevent the Bosnian Serbs from
being supplied through Serbia with fuel and weapons.
However, Serbian petrol tankers are still to be seen rumbling over the
bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a
result of ousting Mr Cosic.
Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in favour of Mr Cosic during the
debate.
The Montenegrin government, already resentful because United Nations
sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than that of Serbia, is
taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it is willing to accept
UN monitors along its border with Bosnia.
'This vote is to be interpreted as a victory for the hardliners. It has
opened the way for very dangerous developments in Montenegro,' says Mr
Dragoslav Micunovic, a democratic opposition leader.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Mayoral polls will point way ahead for Italy: Milan is the
big prize for old and new parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAKEN by terrorist bombings and stirred by 16 unrelenting months of
revelations about political corruption, almost 11m Italians will go to the
polls next Sunday in the first big test of public opinion since last year's
general election.
The voting in mayoral polls will provide the clearest snapshot yet of the
country's mood and the balance of power between the parties.
With national politics in ferment after deepening divisions among the
Socialists - severely tainted by the corruption scandals - and the departure
of the popular Mr Mario Segni from the Christian Democrats, the outcome will
be decisive in mapping the months before a general election widely expected
in the autumn.
Attention on Sunday will focus on a handful of cities, led by Milan, where
new ground is being broken constitutionally as well as politically. For the
first time, voters in towns in mainland Italy will be choosing their mayor
directly, in a reform originally put forward by Mr Segni's referendum
movement. Voters will still be presented with party lists, but the
contenders for mayor need not be linked to any party.
The new system's impact has already been seen in the run-up to the polls,
with a much greater concentration on candidates than on parties.
The change has contributed to the erosion of traditional allegiances, and is
likely to accentuate the broader disillusionment with the established
political order now sweeping much of Italy.
The newly elected mayors will be free to make their own appointments to the
city council, eliminating the arduous horse-trading usually associated with
the translation of electoral support into party politically balanced
councils.
But distancing the mayor's job from party structures does not mean Sunday's
polls are being ignored by the main groupings. Winning control of Milan,
Italy's second city, and Turin, its fourth, represents an important prize
for the victor and a severe loss of face for the losers.
The Lombard League, represented by Mr Marco Formentini, its parliamentary
leader, is pinning its hopes on winning Milan.
Victory would provide the boost Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader, seeks after
gaining control of many smaller Lombardy towns.
The League still suffers from criticisms that it is no more than a protest
movement. Winning in Milan would provide the chance to show it has real
policies and the talent to govern a large conurbation. Failure would be a
serious blow in its Lombard homeland and reinforce suggestions it may be
running out of steam.
Victory for Mr Nando dalla Chiesa, a popular sociologist and MP for La Rete
(Network) would also shake up the established political order. Mr dalla
Chiesa, whose father, a Carabinieri general, was assassinated by the
Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s, is one of La Rete's co-founders with Mr Leoluca
Orlando.
The growing support for the party, which puts crime-and-corruption-busting
at the top of its agenda, epitomises the current breakdown in established
voting patterns. Success in Milan, where Mr dalla Chiesa is supported by the
Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communists, could help
significantly creation a stronger left-wing alliance nationwide.
Failure by both Mr Piero Bassetti and Mr Piero Borghini, two of the three
candidates representing the broad political centre, would be a blow to the
established parties. Mr Bassetti, a former Christian Democrat chairman of
the Lombardy region, is struggling to shake off his political past.
Mr Borghini, a former Communist turned independent, elected mayor with the
blessing of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, would also like
people to forget his links. Though he is widely seen as honest and
intelligent, the Socialist stigma is so strong that Mr Borghini politely
declined the party's formal backing.
With corruption at the forefront and established party alliances crumbling,
dividing lines between local and national issues have become blurred.
Most of the 12 Milan candidates are offering broadly similar policies.
Eliminating political corruption and making city government more transparent
are at the forefront. De-politicising urban administrations by basing
appointments on ability rather than party affiliations also feature
prominently.
The winner may not be known until a widely expected run off, due on June 20.
But whoever captures Milan, the message to Rome is clear: Italian politics
are changing, and those unable to react in time and reform run the risk of
being swept away.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS of last weekend's general election in San Marino have demonstrated
that the world's smallest republic (population 23,000) is in no mood to
change, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The fortunes of the ruling Sanmarinese Christian Democrats have not followed
those of their discredited patrons in neighbouring Italy. They gained 41.4
per cent of the vote compared to 44 per cent in 1988. Their Socialist allies
held on to 23.7 per cent.
Between them these two parties have 40 of the 60 seats in the Great and
General Council which dates back to medieval times, ensuring that they will
form the next 'government'.
The main losers were the reorganised Communists, rechristened the
Progressive Democrats. They won only 18.9 per cent against 28.7 in the
previous election.

FINLAND plans to introduce value added tax next January, at a general rate
of 22 per cent, to help trim government debt and bring the country into line
with the European Community, which Finland hopes to join in 1995, Hugh
Carnegy writes from Stockholm.
Assuming parliament approves, VAT will replace a turnover tax currently
levied at the same rate. But it will cover an extended range of services.
Exemptions are planned on health, social, educational, banking and insurance
services, and on agriculture and forestry.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission looks likely to approve the basic contracts to
provide freight, passenger and sleeper rail services through the Channel
tunnel before the August holidays, following a long competition inquiry.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wants to establish the
principle that private operators can compete with state railway companies,
even if there is little pressure at the moment from potential rival
services.
If the Commission decides to outlaw or substantially amend the contracts,
that could further delay the opening of the tunnel, due in early 1994. Even
so, Mr Van Miert, who used to oversee EC transport policy until he took over
the competition portfolio in January, is said to be keen to encourage the
cross-Channel link.
His spokesman said yesterday that an announcement was expected 'pretty
soon'.
Eurotunnel, which will operate the tunnel, and British and continental
European railways have sought clearance under EC competition rules for a
series of contracts.
Most important is the deal between Eurotunnel, British Rail and SNCF, the
French state railways, which gives the railways the right to take up 50 per
cent of the tunnel's capacity for passenger through-trains during
Eurotunnel's 55-year operating concession.
The other 50 per cent will be used by Eurotunnel itself for shuttle services
between the two ends of the tunnel.
The Commission was originally examining the possibility of reducing the
length of the contract, perhaps to as little as 30 years, to let private
operators compete with BR and SNCF. The Brussels authorities are now
considering how to leave the contract open to competition without
jeopardising the financing of the link.
The Commission is also completing its consultations on the exclusive
contracts for freight and sleeper services.
Yesterday, it published the official notice inviting comments on European
Night Services (ENS), the sleeper joint venture majority-owned by BR in
partnership with French, Dutch, German and Belgian railways. Parties have
been given 30 days to submit views on the agreement, which the Commission
believes could infringe competition rules.
In practice, however, there are few potential competitors who could meet the
high cost of entering the sleeper market. ENS has already placed an order,
said to be worth Pounds 100m, for 139 sleepers to be built by Metro-Cammell,
a subsidiary of GEC Alsthom. The deadline for comments on freight services
through the tunnel passed at the end of March.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Yeltsin attacked on constitution
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's two most implacable opponents yesterday attacked
his plans to push through a new constitution, with Vice-President Alexander
Rutskoi calling him a liar intent on destroying the country with western
support.
Addressing a meeting of local councils, Vice-President Rutskoi called for
parliament to remove the government within a couple of months and for
individual ministers to be tried for committing 'an economic crime against
the people'.
'The president allows himself to lie. Consequently the government allows
itself to lie,' he said in the latest of a series of increasingly bitter
attacks on his former ally.
He also suggested that western support for Mr Yeltsin as a 'great democrat'
was part of a plot which had begun with western support for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika. 'Where did that end? The annihilation of a
great state which was reckoned with by the whole world.'
Last month, Mr Rutskoi claimed that corrupt officials were going to
misappropriate western aid for Russian reforms.
Meanwhile, Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, hinted that
the unruly vice-president might soon be evicted from his office in the
Kremlin.
Yesterday's meeting was convened by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker, to co-ordinate resistance to Mr Yeltsin's Constitutional
Convention, which opens on Saturday with the aim of bypassing parliament to
produce a final draft constitution.
Mr Khasbulatov said he would take action to 'cure' the members of the
parliament's ruling praesidium who tried to remove him from office on
Monday. The rebels included Mr Alexei Pochinok, chairman of the budget
committee, who claimed that 'the whole country is moving towards capitalism
and one man - Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov - is trying to brake this process'.
But with local council representatives hedging their bets now that Mr
Yeltsin has the upper hand in Russian political life, they concluded their
meeting with just a warning that the Constitutional Convention could take no
binding decisions.
They also expressed their opposition to Mr Yeltsin's offer of specially
tailored deals for individual republics within the Russian Federation.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S leading 'odd couple' - Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand,
and Conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur - yesterday made their
international debut by singing broadly the same tune in separate talks with
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor.
At the 61st half-yearly Franco-German summit in Beaune, which will end today
with a press conference by all three men, the priorities are expected to be
the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and the situation in Bosnia.
France is seeking to win German approval for a tougher European negotiating
stance in Gatt.
On Bosnia, Bonn has expressed worry that the Moslems might never be able to
reclaim their land from the 'safe havens' proposed by France and Britain.
French officials say this is a misunderstanding and are privately dismissive
of German concerns about Bosnia, where Bonn has no troops nor intention of
sending any.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary was in Paris to
discuss Bosnia with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart.
Mr Kohl has already navigated the tricky diplomatic waters of a French
'cohabitation' when the conservatives were last in power in Paris in
1986-1988.
In subsequent years spent negotiating the Maastricht treaty he has forged a
close relationship with Mr Mitterrand, but the German leader cannot ignore
the weight that Mr Balladur derives from his enormous parliamentary
majority.
According to a Sofres poll published yesterday, 67 per cent of French
believe that Mr Balladur is the country's real chief executive.

AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry
about a host of obstacles to investing in Russia, Russian officials had
several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.
Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storey
office block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well be
described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.
McDonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serve
Russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most
other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russian
gratitude.
Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact that
McDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a
Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.
He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standards
for the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what he
described as 'the most delicious food'.
But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playing
the balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life has
been tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3
1/2 years ago.
Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the world
the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have
been a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have no
idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.
'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens to
the rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy. We don't have an
estimate of how long it will take. There are too many variables,' said Mr
Cohon.
Apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor, the McDonald's office
block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hard
currency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers.

FT  02 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez floors his conservative
tormentor - Aznar seemed to grow visibly younger, until he looked like a
schoolboy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE A man slipping down a slope, Spain's prime minister Felipe Gonzalez put
a hand out on Monday night and at last found something to hold on to.
Running second in the opinion polls and with just four days left to campaign
before the snap election on June 6, Spain's prime minister for the past 11
years desperately needed his conservative tormentor, People's Party leader
Mr Jose Mara Aznar, to make a mistake in public.
On Monday night he did. During a crucial televised debate, Mr Aznar did not
get a figure wrong or contradict himself; he simply refused, repeatedly and
in front of more than 12m people, to say what he would do if he won the
election.
Where were the policies? Mr Gonzalez asked over and over again. The repeated
and grave reply was that Spain needed a restoration of confidence to
generate savings that would create jobs.
'Obviously that is what Spain needs,' retorted Mr Gonzalez at one point.
'But how? All you ever seem to do is solemnise the obvious.'
This was a different Felipe Gonzalez to the tired figure Mr Aznar was able
to walk over in their first debate a week earlier. He was slippery and much
more nimble than the conservative leader, and even the fiercely
anti-Gonzalez newspaper El Mundo said yesterday morning he had beaten Mr
Aznar.
'A whip-like Socialist leader insisted that Aznar say how he was going to
solve the economic crisis, what he was going to do about unemployment . . .
. Jose Mara Aznar did not survive the attack,' wrote a Mundo columnist, Raul
Heras. 'He should have set aside his script and improvised, but he still
does not know how to.'
It was not a pretty sight. Mr Aznar, who left the building in a hurry after
the three-hour debate, seemed to become visibly younger as the night wore
on. Had he been 51, like Mr Gonzalez, that may have been no bad thing. But
he is only 40. Whoever trained him to laugh and snigger while an opponent is
talking to him was on to a loser. Mr Aznar even laughed while he was -
perhaps because he was - losing arguments, and it made him look like a
schoolboy.
The debate was a revelation because, while Mr Gonzalez was equally vague
about what he would do to get Spain out of its recession, it also
demonstrated his ability to think on his feet. It seemed to expose a
hitherto hidden weakness in Mr Aznar - the fact, as El Mundo pointed out,
that he struggles to improvise under pressure.
Spain will have taken note, and there is no doubt Mr Gonzalez will have
succeeded in persuading many hundreds of thousands of undecided former
Socialist voters to stay away from the PP and, perhaps, return to the fold.
At a national level, the debate may even have been enough to enable the
Socialists to draw level again with the PP. According to a poll in El Pas at
the weekend, the PP was leading by enough to take a parliamentary majority
of about four seats.
But the rot in the Socialist tree at a provincial level, where the votes are
counted, may be too far gone. Under Spain's rigid system of proportional
representation, one vote can decide the fate of a series of seats in
parliament and voters have to vote for one party, not individuals. While Mr
Gonzalez leads in personal polls, the divided Socialist party is nowhere
near as attractive to voters.
The prime minister never mentioned his party during the debate and, oddly,
Mr Aznar never tried to force him to.
The playing field is level again (though that, in itself, is a big setback
for Mr Gonzalez, who has a parliamentary majority for the time being).
Instead, the prime minister has been allowed, at the last minute, to make
the election a personal affair and to dare the country to sack him.
It has worked before and Mr Aznar's performance on Monday will not have made
the alternative very attractive.
