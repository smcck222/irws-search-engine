FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Regulation needed to help control executive salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK H BROOME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Owen Green, former chairman of BTR, has said all that is necessary
about the affront to employees and shareholders arising from excessive
remuneration of executives. Those of us who naively assumed that one of the
aims of the London Stock Exchange was to improve corporate governance will
be dismayed by your reports about the salary increases to its former chief
executive, and the reference to a pay-off after his resignation ('Exchange
paid Rawlins Pounds 348,500', May 24).
Shareholders should be even more concerned as the stock exchange is one of
the principal paymasters of ProShare, which claims to be representative of
their interests - Quis custodiet . . . ?
It is sadly now clear that self-regulation is not an option, and that
government must take early steps to introduce changes to the Companies Act
and to set up a regulator to ensure that executives are made responsible to
their shareholders. There are more than enough examples to constitute a big
scandal.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Train will have to take strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM BODEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As part of the transport secretary's 'big public debate' on motorway
charges ('Motorway charges scheme provokes opposition', May 27), I put
forward a view which has so far been ignored - real investment in the
railway network to make it financially advantageous to travel by rail rather
than by road. Charging motorway users in order to raise money for more new
motorways will not reduce congestion, nor will rail privatisation entice
more people to travel by train. They will just add to motorway congestion.
At some point we will have to accept that unlimited private road travel is
not possible, both economically and environmentally. It might as well be
now.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Education voucher a big step forward in bridging
academic and vocational divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALISTAIR GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding Lisa Wood's article, 'Education voucher scheme proposed' (May
25), it is not just the Confederation of British Industry which is taking
forward the idea of 16- year-olds receiving vouchers or credits in exchange
for education or training.
Calderdale &amp; Kirklees Training and Enterprise Council is taking part in the
second round of the Youth Credit pilots. We are being watched more closely
than many pilots, because we are the only one to offer a combined education
and training option.
Launched in April this year, Next Step is available to some 6,600 young
people who now have a genuine and extended career choice.
This Tec believes in reducing the divide that still exists between the
education and training establishments, which is why our initiative is built
upon a strong partnership between ourselves, two education authorities,
colleges, training providers and employers.
Our initiative is not the ideal because we have different funding
arrangements for education and training. The proposed education voucher, if
linked with the CBI idea of careership, would represent an important step
forward in bridging the academic and vocational divide.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Letter: Seeds of economic discontent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ROBERT HARKNESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Official figures for inflation often do not seem to accord with
experience. I offer an interesting example of the discrepancy, namely the
price of packets of seeds.
I do not throw the old packets away and have them going back up to 10 years,
to 1983. Prices that I have looked at have gone up at the rate of about 10
per cent a year over this period and at a very regular progression.
As an example, I would give figures for cabbage seed (winnigstadt). The cost
in pence per packet were as follows (some years missing) from 1983: 27, -,
33, 36, 39, 43, -, 51, -,  -, 69. If you plot these figures on a log-scale,
you will find a beautiful straight line, as though it were company policy to
increase prices by 10 per cent a year automatically. A packet of this seed
will cost Pounds 1 in 1997.
In the course of this exercise, I bought a packet of polyanthus seeds this
year at Pounds 2.10. Inside there were 20 seeds which I weighed at 21mg, or
about 1mg per seed. This works out at just less than Pounds 3,000 per ounce,
which is very well up on gold.
More examples of particular price inflation would be interesting.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Steady hand at the helm: Peter Norman sifts through Kenneth
Clarke's in-tray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a fair bet that Mr Kenneth Clarke will have left the Treasury last
night after his first day as chancellor with nautical metaphors ringing in
his ears.
'Don't rock the boat,' and 'steady as she goes' is the advice that the
mandarins of Great George Street hope the new tenant of Number 11 Downing
Street will take to heart as he wades through red boxes of briefing papers
during next week's parliamentary recess.
The timing of Mr Norman Lamont's departure - with the economy in recovery,
and between this year's March and November Budgets - means that there is no
immediate economic pressure on Mr Clarke to act.
Although his appointment prompted some calls for a further cut in bank base
rates from their present 6 per cent, the Treasury will have moved quickly to
quash such an idea.
Both the Treasury and Bank of England fear that lower interest rates could
boost inflation and risk pushing the underlying inflation rate through the
upper limit of the government's 1 to 4 per cent target range.
More important, Mr Clarke will be told - politely, of course - that
financial markets would take fright if a new chancellor with no previous
economic policy experience started to throw his weight around.
Timing and mood are everything in monetary policy. The financial markets
already think too many base rate cuts over the past two and half years have
been politically motivated.
A brief spell of masterly inactivity might give Mr Clarke that air of
gravitas needed for the successful conduct of monetary policy as well as
time to swot up the jargon he will need to carry off his June 15 Mansion
House Speech to the City with aplomb.
The dossiers dealing with the UK's public sector borrowing requirement of
Pounds 50bn, equivalent to 8 per cent of national output, will make for less
comfortable reading. Here the new chancellor will be urged to plan decisive
action.
Mr Michael Portillo, the able chief secretary to the Treasury, warned 10
days ago that Britain's primary deficit - that is, the deficit excluding
debt interest - is already the highest in the European Community. The choice
facing Mr Clarke is to cut this by tax increases or spending reductions.
The Treasury will probably urge him to focus on spending cuts, even though
scare stories about proposed attacks on the welfare state have done much to
unsettle the government over the past month.
There is political as well as economic logic behind such a move. Mr Clarke's
clear support for spending cuts would make an ally of Mr Portillo and
assuage the Tory right wing, which would be hostile to tax increases.
It would also win over the Treasury establishment to the new chancellor's
side and strengthen the Treasury against the rest of Whitehall.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Tiny portrait on an epic scale: The latest book on Lonrho's
chief reveals the full range of his virtues and vices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TINY ROWLAND
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A REBEL TYCOON By Tom Bower Heinemann, Pounds 16.99, pp659
Whatever else may be said about Tom Bower's new book on Tiny Rowland of
Lonrho, it is not - pace Mr Rowland - dull. How could it be, given the
nature of the man in question? The individual who has been the driving force
behind this sprawling international conglomerate admittedly has his fair
share of standard entrepreneurial characteristics: the giant ego, mercurial
temperament, preference for malleable courtiers and vindictiveness towards
those who cross or fail him. But in Rowland's case the virtues and vices are
on a colossal scale. And then, of course, there is his love affair with
Africa.
There are few less promising territories for large-scale Western
entrepreneurship than sub-Saharan black Africa. With a total GNP that ranks
no greater than one of the smaller European economies, the region has
resolutely failed to take off economically. Yet Tiny Rowland made this
difficult continent his stamping ground and forged close relationships with
numerous black African leaders.
As Tom Bower underlines, in his exhaustively researched account, Rowland has
benefited handsomely from his courtship of the Africans. Indeed, his great
achievement after thirty odd-years has been to extract an enormous amount of
cash for himself from a company which has suffered from severe constraints
on the remittance of profits and many of whose assets in black Africa have
been difficult to realise.
The rewards have come via a frequently over-generous dividend policy, a
regal pay package and, finally, the sale of part of his share stake to the
mysterious German entrepreneur Dieter Bock. But despite cashing in a
majority of his chips, he has retained a position as joint managing director
and chief executive alongside Bock, and thus, for the moment, his
jet-setting life style and entree to all those black African heads of state.
There was a time, after the great boardroom battle over governance issues in
the early 1970s - the revolt of Sir Basil Smallpeice and the 'Straight
Eight' directors - when the small shareholders who flocked to Tiny's banner
would take anything on trust. But when the irrepressible tycoon, now past
75, surveyed his flock at Lonrho's last annual general meeting there were
signs of growing impatience. And not before time. For all Rowland's tireless
activity, Lonrho's earnings record has been patchy and the dividend has had
to be cut in the midst of a cash crisis. Worse, Rowland sold his shares to
Bock at a premium over the market price, leaving others in the lurch. Bock,
meantime, remains an unknown quantity to be taken on Tiny's say so, as he
comes closer to taking his conge.
But thus it ever was with Lonrho. Rowland's style has always been that of
the 19th century buccaneer and it will never be trimmed to suit the
requirements of best accountancy practice or the finer points of the Cadbury
Report. There has long been ample evidence, for those who contemplated
entrusting their money to his stewardship, of the warts-and-all nature of
the investment. Also of the hit-and-miss nature of Tiny's management style.
Spectacular successes, for example, in mining in Africa or in vehicle
distribution in Europe have been matched by equally spectacular failures
such as the decline of the loss-making Observer and the attempt to develop
the Wankel rotary engine, where the rights were recently sold for a nominal
sum.
Nor is there anything new about cash crises. Lonrho's history has been
punctuated with them, just as it has been by critical government reports and
official hostility. The amazing thing is that a company whose finances have
often appeared to have been held together by string should have survived so
long and paid out so much in dividends.
Bower's account may not cast much light on where Lonrho goes from here, or
on the background and intentions of Mr Bock. His description of the
protracted battle with Mohamed Fayed for control of Harrods - the noisiest
case in corporate history of the pot calling the kettle black - is
comprehensive without adding greatly to what is already known. But there are
plenty of nuggets scattered throughout the book. And it raises serious
questions about the extent of the benefits to black Africa of Lonrho's
activities.
While the company has promoted valuable projects across Africa, Bower puts a
plausible case that the Africans failed to benefit as they should have done
because of the venality of such men as Dr Hastings Banda of Malawi and
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia who dispensed monopoly rights to Lonrho. And he
alleges instances of bribery of high-ranking Africans out of an account
called 'General Expenses' at Lonrho's Cheapside headquarters.
It is, admittedly, a moot point whether Africans would have been better off
if moral scruples had prevented trade or investment in countries where
economic power has been concentrated in the hands of a single, repressive
ruler like Dr Banda. And certainly throughout the Lonrho saga the British
government has been wedded to realpolitik on such issues, whether dealing
with trade sanctions against Rhodesia or the specific problem of bribes.
Bower recounts that when DTI inspectors investigating Lonrho in the 1970s
consulted the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office about such payments, they were
asked to draw a discreet veil over the subject to prevent damage to British
interests.
Rowland might well argue that he has constantly been attacked for doing what
countless others have done. But then, from his expressions of sympathy for
the Nazis while at school in Hampshire to his outbursts against Edward Heath
and the then Mrs Thatcher during the Fayed imbroglio, he has never hesitated
to make things needlessly difficult for himself. But he does at least have a
talent to amuse. This week's three-sentence press release on the publication
of Bower's book, baldly headed 'Statement by Tiny Rowland', declared: 'I
very much regret that a boring and unrecognisable account of my life should
have been published today entitled 'A Rebel Tycoon'. None of the interesting
bits are in. I know many people, but, thank God, not the author.'
It is a characteristic gem, but not one which should deter any potential
reader of the book.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Pull together, or fall apart: The Tory party must choose
between power and revenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the Conservative party must make up its mind. Fair or otherwise, Mr John
Major has removed the fault-line in his cabinet. Mr Norman Lamont's
departure was a necessary condition for the prime minister's survival. But
it was not sufficient. Now it is for his party, exhausted and faction-riven,
to decide whether it has, any longer, the will to govern.
The first response was not encouraging. The disgruntled, disenchanted and
irreconcilable on the Tory backbenches once again filled the airwaves. For
some, Mr Major had not done enough. The game of musical chairs which had
accompanied Mr Lamont's sacking had smacked of timidity rather than firm
government.
Others - on the Euro-sceptic right - were busy laying down publicly the
conditions under which Mr Kenneth Clarke could run the Treasury: no return
to the exchange rate mechanism, real cuts in the welfare state. Hard to
remember that the Conservatives once were the party of unity.
In private conversations there was not even the pretence of common cause.
How close Mr Clarke was now to the premiership was the rhetorical question
of one ministerial colleague. The Tories still have a sense of history. Had
not Mr Anthony Eden sealed his fate as prime minister when in 1955 he had
made Mr Harold MacMillan his chancellor?
What were we to make of Mr Michael Heseltine's public admission that Mr
Lamont had been a scapegoat, queried another loyal colleague. He answered
the question himself: Mr Heseltine was positioning himself for a leadership
contest.
Then there was the synthetic shock at Mr Lamont's departure. For months now
MPs across the party have been complaining that the government's fortunes
were irrecoverable as long Mr Lamont stayed in Number 11 Downing Street.
After the defeats in Newbury and the county council elections on May 6, the
clamour became deafening. If Mr Major did not listen, he would be considered
weak, wounded, and vulnerable to a leadership challenge in the autumn. The
best Mr Lamont's colleagues could offer when asked to defend the then
chancellor was a doleful flick of the eyebrows, an embarrassed glance at
scuffed shoes.
Anyone who followed close-up the campaign against Mr Lamont cannot escape
one conclusion: if the former chancellor was betrayed, it was not by Mr
Major but by his party. That includes many Mr Lamont might still number
among his political friends. They found no time to consider the justice of
it all as they waited in eager anticipation on Thursday morning for the
summons to 10 Downing Street.
By yesterday Mr Michael Howard, the newly-promoted home secretary, was
dismissing the recriminations as 'tittle-tattle'. Mr Heseltine reminded us
that politics had always been a 'ruthless business'. But that sounds too
polite for the modern Tory party.
Mr Major's only hope now is that is that after a year on the edge of the
abyss, the government's supporters at Westminster will come to their
collective senses. The choice is a straightforward one: between power and
revenge.
He might be lucky. The recession has ended. By the end of the July the
bitter struggle over the Maastricht treaty should be over. For all the
apparent lack of inspiration in the reshuffle which accompanied Mr Lamont's
departure, the re-arranging of the place mats around the cabinet table could
make a difference. The new line-up may well reinforce the impression that Mr
Major is the creature rather than the master of his cabinet. The authority
of Messrs Clarke, Hurd, Howard and Heseltine will be unchallengable.
But if his colleagues manage to contain their personal ambitions, the prime
minister should be able to turn their political effectiveness to his own
advantage.
Mr Clarke is an accomplished operator - described by Lord Tebbit, no less,
as the best politician in the cabinet. His formidable skills should allow
the government to draw maximum advantage from the slow process of economic
recovery. He should restore to management of the economy an impression at
least that the government has retrieved its grip. At times like this,
political weight is worth much more than detailed comprehension of the
Treasury's monetary motorways.
The medium problems facing the British economy (see below) - a Pounds
1bn-a-week borrowing requirement, an inflation psychology which has been
suppressed rather than extinguished - have not departed with Mr Lamont.
But in the short term, low inflation and the emerging recovery provide Mr
Clarke with a valuable breathing space. And if more pain is required in the
November budget - on the spending, the tax or on both sides of the
Treasury's balance sheet - the new chancellor is as good as any to placate
his colleagues on the backbenches.
Mr Clarke's easy relationship with Mr Douglas Hurd (he ran the foreign
secretary's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 1990) and with Mr Heseltine
carries with it obvious advantages. The government's policy towards Europe
will be shaped by a chancellor and foreign secretary who share the same
outlook. The Treasury now has a master sympathetic rather than antagonistic
to the ambitions of the department of trade and industry. Mr David Hunt's
appointment to head employment completes the picture. A former acolyte of Mr
Heseltine, Mr Hunt shares the view that government can no longer afford to
be indifferent to the fate of industry.
Mr Howard, of course, is not a member of the same One-Nation team. But his
promotion to the Home Office will be well-received among the party's
activists. Now anointed as the candidate of the right, he will offer the
government's supporters on the ground the reassurance they have been
demanding that it is prepared to be tough on crime. And for now, Mr Howard's
interest lies in Mr Major's leadership.
All of this will count for nothing unless the party at Westminster is
willing to endorse the prime minister's words, that tomorrow is more
important than yesterday. Fourteen years in government, the enforced
departure of Lady Thatcher and the war over Maastricht have torn apart the
fabric of loyalty on which Conservative governments could once depend.
Restoring the habit of discipline will not be easy. The wounds inflicted by
Maastricht will not be healed by the appointment to the Treasury of an
enthusiast for Europe. Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit have yet to have their
say on the treaty in the House of Lords.
And brooding in the background stands Mr Lamont. Convinced that he has been
betrayed, the former chancellor must decide whether he values his reputation
above revenge. He does not have the authority enjoyed by the then Mr Nigel
Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe when they delivered from the backbenches their
devastating indictments of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government. Mr Major
though has a parliamentary majority of only 18. It is likely to be reduced
to 17 after what promises to be another devastating defeat in the
Christchurch by-election. It takes fewer than a dozen malcontents on the
backbenches to destabilise his government. Mr Lamont could expect to
mobilise substantially more.
Thursday was meant to mark a new beginning for Mr Major's government. It
might. But only if the Conservatives rediscover the will to govern. If not,
it will mark the beginning of the end.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Siren voices for Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1960s, the name of the would-be hero was Reginald Maudling; in the
1970s, it was Anthony Barber; in the 1980s, far more unluckily, it was Nigel
Lawson. Is it to be Kenneth Clarke in the 1990s?
In each of the three previous decades, a Conservative chancellor of the
exchequer has inherited an economy suffering from high unemployment. Each
time he has found good reasons to 'go for growth'; each time the experiment
has been welcomed; but each time it has subsequently been condemned, along
with its begetter. To make this mistake once was perhaps a misfortune. To do
so twice already looked like carelessness. But to do it a fourth time,
would, in a just world, discredit the Tories completely.
This is, however, the trap into which a self-confident, yet economically
untutored man like Kenneth Clarke is most likely to fall. He will be advised
by his political friends to ignore orthodox advisers discredited by past
failures. It would take a mixture of a saint and a hero not to ignore only
the uncomfortable messages.
With only the financial markets as discipline, the choice will be largely up
to Mr Clarke. His position within the government must be as strong as any
chancellor's in living memory. Unlike Mr Lamont, hapless servant of his
predecessor and boss, Mr Clarke may decide for himself. But first he has to
listen.
Whispers in his ear
'Growth is what we need, old boy,' his party colleagues must already be
whispering in his ear. 'Ignore that fellow Portillo, far too Thatcherite.
Already discredited by that kite about prescription charges for the elderly.
It will be bad enough keeping to existing spending plans, never mind cutting
them further.
'It's all very well for Major to talk about protecting vulnerable groups in
society. Vulnerable groups don't vote for us. Most of them don't even vote.
The vulnerable group that matters is us. Can't bash our voters with the
longest recession since the 1930s, falling house prices, negative equity,
unemployment and then make them pay university fees for their kids. Abolish
their mortgage interest relief, child benefit and state pensions? Suicide.
'What's that about higher taxation? Lamont threatened an extra Pounds 10bn
two years hence. That's quite enough. Higher income tax? You haven't been on
the job very long. You'd have to double the income tax take to get rid of
this year's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. Raising the basic rate of tax
to 30p gives a measly Pounds 8bn. Game's not worth the candle.
'We have to offer our bit of the great British public more of what they
want, not less. Growth's what we need. 3 1/2 per cent a year for a few years
and that deficit will just melt away. What about inflation? Don't worry
about that. Leave the worrying to Mr George at the Bank of England, so long
as you don't let him do anything about it. Wages? We need higher wages. It
makes people feel good. Two to three years of fast growth, another election,
big majority; then the hair shirt, if you must.'
Inflation target
The same points, more elegantly expressed, are to be found in the press. So
which advice will Mr Clarke listen to? Will it be the siren voices? Will it
be his orthodox advisers? Ideally, it will be neither.
Once it becomes obvious that the chancellor has a target for economic
growth, expectations in the labour market will shift. So will expectations
in the gilts markets. But financial markets cannot be trusted to see the
danger in time. They did not in the 1980s. Yet the time to worry about
inflation is not at the end of the next expansion. The time is now, at the
beginning of a recovery. The chancellor should delay interest rate cuts. He
should confirm the 1-4 per cent inflation target. Ideally, he would also
take a leaf from the German economic book he is supposed to admire and push
for an independent central bank.
Where he should part company from his advisers is over their apparent view
that the exchange rate is just a tool of counter-inflationary policy. Real
exchange rates matter, since they determine the prospects for all businesses
subject to international competition. His aim should be to use his present,
possibly brief window of opportunity to rebalance policy aggressively and,
if necessary, subsequently offset tighter fiscal policy by lower interest
and exchange rates. The unified Budget due in November is his chance. If the
government is to be safe from all mishap, it must double the size of the
phased fiscal adjustment Mr Lamont proposed last March.
Mr Clarke can be another 'go for growth' hero of the hour or he can build on
the low inflation achieved by his predecessors. To choose the latter course
is politically and even economically risky. To choose the former is not
risky at all, since the ultimate result is quite certain. No prudent
chancellor would act on the assumption that the UK economy will float away
from its troubles on a tide of rapid growth. The next six months will show
whether Mr Clarke is going to be a prudent chancellor, or another gambler.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Clarke in low-key start at Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the new chancellor, took command of the Treasury
yesterday and immediately closeted himself with his second-in-command and
fellow cabinet member Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary.
It was a low-key start for a big step in Mr Clarke's cabinet career. But
some Whitehall-watchers accorded it more than usual significance.
They said that if Mr Clarke could forge an alliance with the rightwing Mr
Portillo, he would be the strongest minister in the government and able to
reassert the Treasury's authority in Whitehall. To achieve this, however, Mr
Clarke would probably have to take an even tougher line on cutting public
spending than Mr Norman Lamont would have done.
Mr Clarke was welcomed into the Treasury by Mr Portillo and by Sir Terence
Burns, the permanent secretary, and later met senior officials. He asked for
briefing papers on the key issues facing the department and will return next
Wednesday, during the parliamentary recess, for a full programme of
discussions on policy.
Public spending is at the top of the new chancellor's agenda because
difficult decisions on priorities have to be taken soon before the autumn
negotiations with spending ministries get under way.
Mr Clarke impressed officials with his practical approach to problems. One
said that he doubted whether he had arrived at the Treasury 'with life all
worked out'. Others, while regretting the nature of Mr Lamont's departure,
were looking forward to the return of a political heavyweight to 11 Downing
Street.
Although Mr Clarke has never worked as a Treasury minister he has experience
of economic issues. He shared in the decision to take sterling out of the
European exchange rate mechanism and was a member of the EDX committee of
ministers which pushed through last year's tight spending round.
In the mid-1980s he was a member of the 'star chamber' committee charged
with pruning excess public expenditure and won admiration from Treasury
officials for his determination to keep spending under control.
Yesterday saw the departure from the Treasury of Mr Rupert Darwall, one of
Mr Lamont's political advisers. It is expected that Mr Bill Robinson, Mr
Lamont's senior adviser who was brought into the Treasury in 1991 from the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies to help with tax reform, will leave
soon.
Mr Clarke will be bringing Ms Tessa Keswick and Mr David Ruffley from the
Home Office to spearhead his personal staff.
Speculation on other moves in the Treasury centred on Mr Jeremy Heyward, Mr
Lamont's 30-year-old private secretary. Mr Heyward has had a meteoric career
in the Treasury under Mr Lamont's wing. He was also private secretary to Mr
Lamont when he was financial secretary and chief secretary at the Treasury.
Mr Heyward's subsequent move to head the former chancellor's private office
raised a few eyebrows among older officials, who saw it as too big a
promotion. He is thought to be due for a move because of the strains of the
private office job.
Other changes in the Treasury are likely to be limited, at least until plans
for the unified Budget in November have been completed.
Possible contenders for Mr Heyward's job are Mr Adam Sharples and Mr Jim
Hibberd, officials who are more senior than Mr Hayward was when he got the
job.
Generally, Mr Clarke's move to the Treasury has been welcomed. One official
said: 'We are pleased that he is coming. We are talking about a set of
employees who have been extremely depressed for a long time, especially
since the devaluation of the pound.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Clarke urged to give Bank of England responsibility for
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the new chancellor, has been urged to give the Bank of
England sole responsibility for setting interest rates in Britain, Peter
Norman writes.
A report published today by the influential European Policy Forum said
Britain's present inflation target should be the subject of a contract
between the government and the Bank's governor so that the UK could be
'locked in' to a low-inflation economic policy. It also said the Bank should
set target ranges for the growth of money supply.
Mr Frank Vibert, the report's author, said such steps would allow Britain to
keep pace with moves to central-bank independence in the European Monetary
System.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Minister proposes moves to speed house buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to speed the process of house buying are to be introduced in an
effort to boost the housing market recovery, the Department of the
Environment said yesterday.
The proposals, which would force local authorities in England and Wales to
reply to standard land-search inquiries within a statutory period and give
the public greater access to land information, are due to be announced by
Sir George Young, housing minister, in a speech to the National Association
of Estate Agents tonight.
A government consultative document examining ways of improving purchasing
procedures, and guaranteeing the public's access to property information in
accordance with the Citizen's Charter, is due to be issued within the next
few weeks.
Proposals for the creation of a national land information system are also
under discussion.
The environment department said yesterday the initiative was in response to
a 'clear recognition' that the present purchasing procedure needed to be
speeded up.
Sir George, noting that 'just about every housing market indicator' was
pointing to a recovery, said: 'There is considerable evidence of pent-up
demand. There are clear signs that buyers who have been holding back waiting
for the housing market to pick up are now becoming active.'
Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate
Agents, said agents would welcome the initiative, which they had been
demanding for some time.
'At the moment so much time is wasted by people in local authorities
dragging their feet,' he said.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Tory warns on immigration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WINSTON Churchill, Conservative MP for Davyhulme, yesterday called for a
halt to the 'relentless flow' of immigrants to the UK.
He told a meeting in Bolton, Lancashire: 'With this government continuing to
bring in immigrants each year at a scale, in Mrs Thatcher's immortal phrase
of 15 years ago, 'equivalent to a town the size of Grantham' a halt must be
called - and urgently - if the British way of life is to be preserved.' He
said the population of many northern English cities was 'well over 50 per
cent immigrant'. Muslims claimed that they numbered more than 2m in Britain.
Mr Niranjan Deva, the black Tory MP for Brentford and Isleworth, said: 'I am
shocked and disappointed by Mr Churchill's comments.'
He added: 'For a start, Mr Churchill has got his facts wrong. There is no
primary immigration from the Indian sub-continent. The only immigrants from
there who are allowed to settle are the dependants of relatives already
here.'
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said: 'He (Mr Churchill) is
mouthing the empty rhetoric of Powellism, whose prophecies of doom have been
proved to be hopelessly wrong.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Market dictates speedy memoirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the backbench MP, will have to be very fast and very frank
if he hopes to make even a modest killing from his memoirs.
Mr Julian Rivers, marketing director of bookstore chain Dillons, said: 'A
biography of Lamont would be a disaster. An autobiography could be a big
success but only if he writes it now, while he is still angry.'
Mr Matthew Evans, chairman of Faber &amp; Faber, which is publishing the memoirs
of former home secretary Mr Kenneth Baker, believes the Lamont story could
be worth up to Pounds 200,000, but only if it was produced quickly - ideally
this year. 'If he goes on the back benches for three years then it's worth
Pounds 10,000,' Mr Evans added.
WH Smith, the UK's largest bookseller, warned that political memoirs rarely
sold well, with Liberal Democrat reminiscences faring much worse than their
political rivals. A WH Smith executive said: 'Just look at the cut-price
tables. They're all there.'
A Norman Lamont political life would only work, the executive added, 'if he
moved quickly, got someone to write it for him and he told the truth'.
Publishers are sure the former chancellor has a few interesting stories to
tell if he chooses to, such as what really happened on Black Wednesday, the
day Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
Baroness Thatcher is now dominating the world of political memoirs, just as
she dominated political life when she was prime minister.
Harper Collins is reported to have paid an advance of Pounds 3.2m, and her
800-page tome is expected to reach the bookshops in October. By comparison
Sir Edward Heath, who was commissioned by Weidenfeld in 1985, has not
completed his work.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Lamont returns to backbench beat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON HIS first day back on the beat as an ordinary backbench MP, Mr Norman
Lamont was at pains to show that it was business as usual at his Kingston
upon Thames constituency in south-west London.
People who visited him on constituency concerns had varying views of how the
former chancellor was facing up to his loss of office.
Mr Jan Korff said he looked 'fine' and fairly relaxed, but Mr Laurie Fedder
said he seemed downbeat.
'He was looking pretty grim,' said Mr Fedder, who said that when he had made
the appointment three or four weeks ago he had been intending to see the
chancellor of the exchequer.
Mr Lamont drove to his weekly surgery at the local Conservative party
headquarters in a grey Vauxhall Cavalier. As he arrived, he showed little
sign of the strain of the previous days. Mr Ron Gill, chairman of the
Kingston and Malden Conservative Association, said the local constituency
party would be glad to see more of him.
Mr Adam Burt, a friend and former political agent for Mr Lamont, said after
meeting him that he 'looked relaxed and very happy. He did not look tense.
He did not appear bitter at all.'
Mr Burt added that he thought the events of the last few days were
'disgraceful'. He added: 'Mr Lamont said he would like to stay in politics.'
Mr Lamont told the Grimsby Evening Telegraph yesterday that he expected to
take about a week to move out of 11 Downing Street, writes Ralph Atkins.
Choosing his mother's local paper, rather than the national press, for his
first post-resignation comments, Mr Lamont said he hoped to visit Grimsby
soon. He refused to discuss the row over his resignation.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Reshuffle leaves City in the dark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the high political drama of the previous day, financial market dealers
packed up for the holiday weekend last night amid uncertainty as to what Mr
Kenneth Clarke's appointment as chancellor would mean for trading in
sterling, equities and government bonds.
Questions about future government policy have led to a sharp weakening of
sterling on the foreign exchanges.
In the 1 1/2 trading days since Mr Clarke became chancellor no clear
consensus has emerged from the markets on what his policy will be on
inflation, the value of sterling or the state of the public finances.
'We are really in the dark about Mr Clarke,' said Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief
economist at Hambros Bank in London. 'Unlike the last three chancellors he
has never been in the Treasury before and his real views are still a
mystery.'
The main impetus for sterling's weakness has been renewed strength of the
D-Mark amid fresh tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism and a
belief that German interest rate cuts are on hold.
On top of this the change of chancellor has, as one dealer said yesterday,
left sterling looking rudderless. The pound closed down 3 pfennigs against
the D-Mark yesterday at DM2.4775. That left it more than 4 pfennigs weaker
than it had been on Wednesday night.
Gilt prices have also suffered, falling a point yesterday amid concerns that
Mr Clarke could take a softer line on UK monetary policy and public
finances. But UK share prices have barely moved since his appointment, with
the FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closing last night down
14.6 points at 2,840.7 amid weakness in US stocks.
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel in London,
believes the prevailing view in markets towards the impact of the reshuffle
at the moment is 'suck it and see'.
'Lamont's departure and Clarke's arrival are unlikely to result in any broad
change in the direction of UK economic policy,' he said. 'Besides, the
markets had assumed that Lamont would be going a long time ago, the only
issue was when.'
However, some believe Mr Clarke is more likely to cut UK base rates from
their current levels than Mr Lamont was. 'This fellow is more of a
politician than anything else,' said Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in
London. 'I would have thought there was more chance of a rate cut under Mr
Clarke, to keep political momentum going.'
However, Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at investment bank SG Warburg,
believes Mr Clarke will not be as easy on the public sector borrowing
requirement as he might like to be.
Mr Gardiner believes one of the most important decisions made by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, this week was to retain Mr Michael Portillo as
chief secretary to the Treasury.
'He has been confirmed in that post and will continue to be very tough on
public spending,' he said.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Policy choices facing chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said that Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment signified
no change in economic policy, but to what extent will the new chancellor's
hands be tied?
The first pointers will come as the finance bill implementing the measures
Mr Norman Lamont announced in his March Budget completes its passage through
parliament.
There certainly appears to be little prospect of a U-turn on the
controversial imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, much as Labour
may bay for one.
If he wanted to change Mr Lamont's VAT plans before the finance bill is
enacted, Mr Clarke would hand Labour the chance to force two high-profile
and potentially damaging Commons debates on the subject. When MPs debated
the proposals this month two Tories staged an embarrassing rebellion and the
government scraped home by 10 votes.
But there are a number of reasons why Mr Clarke may not regard his
predecessor's legacy as absolutely sacrosanct. These could give him a
powerful incentive to try to persuade his cabinet colleagues to back his
judgment.
First, it would be unreasonable to expect the new chancellor to be as
attached to every detail of the March package as was its author, his
predecessor. He might be prepared to tolerate, for example, some fine-tuning
of Mr Lamont's proposed reform of the North Sea tax regime - especially if
he was convinced it would not cost the exchequer money.
Second, there would be few surer ways of stamping his authority on his new
portfolio for a politician who is not averse to dramatic gestures.
Third - and perhaps most persuasively - some of Mr Lamont's proposals are
not covered by the finance bill and could be altered without
headline-grabbing and potentially risky parliamentary debates.
Into this category falls the planned 1 percentage-point increase in
employees' national insurance contribution rates, which is aimed at raising
Pounds 1.8bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 2.2bn the following year.
The legislation enshrining this will not reach parliament until November at
the earliest. Mr Clarke could modify the proposal at any time with a simple
announcement.
Similarly, Mr Lamont's plans to widen the 20 per cent band of income tax are
not fully incorporated into the current finance bill. The committee of MPs
considering the bill is due to debate widening the band by Pounds 500 to the
first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income the week after next. But Mr Lamont's
proposal to extend it further to the Pounds 3,000 level is not included in
the bill.
Mr Clarke could send out an early signal of his intention to get to grips
with the public sector borrowing requirement by announcing the second phase
of this extension had been scrapped. This would save the Treasury an
estimated Pounds 320m next year and Pounds 450m the year after that.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Japanese make 22% of car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE carmakers accounted for more than a fifth of UK car production in
the first three months of the year, figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders show.
Nissan, which began producing cars at its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant in
1986, overtook Vauxhall for the first time to claim third place behind Rover
and Ford.
The three Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda, which have all
located their first European car plants in the UK, produced 80,065 cars in
Britain in the first quarter of the year, or 22 per cent of total UK car
output.
Overall UK car production in the first three months increased by 6.2 per
cent to 364,509 from 343,318 in the same period a year ago, as rising output
from the Japanese producers more than compensated for lower production from
the traditional volume carmakers in the UK, Rover, Ford of the US, Vauxhall,
the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, and Peugeot.
Nissan, which plans to raise production at its Sunderland plant by 51 per
cent this year to 270,000 from 179,000 last year, increased output
year-on-year in the first quarter by 88 per cent to 70,058.
Honda, which began output at its Swindon plant last October, produced 5,199
cars in the first quarter and plans to produce 32,000 cars in the whole of
this year.
Toyota output at its plant at Burnaston near Derby, which was opened in
December, totalled 4,808 in the first three months and is expected to reach
36,000 in the full year.
Rover, Ford and Vauxhall all produced fewer cars in the first quarter than
in the same period a year ago, with Ford car output falling by 17 per cent
to 75,561.
The traditional volume carmakers in Britain are all feeling the impact of
the sharp decline in new car sales in continental Europe, although the
impact is being cushioned in part by the greatly improved competitiveness of
the UK as a production source for the pan-European carmakers.
According to GM the two Vauxhall assembly plants in the UK are now its
lowest-cost plants in west Europe.
Commercial vehicle production fell by 11.4 per cent in the first three
months. Output has been hit in part by the collapse into receivership of
Leyland Daf in early February.
Output continued at both the Leyland Daf van plant at Birmingham and at the
truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, but at a much lower level than
a year ago.
Leyland Daf Vans, which has been taken out of receivership by a management
buy-out, produced 2,755 vans in the first quarter, a 49.6 per cent fall from
the same period a year ago.
The Leyland Daf truck plant, which is still in receivership, suffered a 45
per cent drop in output. Negotiations on a rescue of the plant are expected
to be completed in the next two weeks.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Thatcherite lashes out after sacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S attempts to promote loyalist Tory MPs in his reshuffle of
the ministerial ranks below the cabinet provoked a backlash from a rightwing
victim yesterday.
Mr Edward Leigh, the Thatcherite junior minister at the Department of Trade
and Industry until Thursday, said he had been sacked because of his widely
known opposition to government policies, particularly over the Maastricht
treaty.
With Tory Euro-sceptics eager to find new champions, Mr Leigh warned the
prime minister: 'He (Mr Major) obviously feels that I argued my corner too
strongly within government and I will have to argue it even more strongly
from the backbenches.'
Mr Leigh predicted on BBC radio that Mr Norman Lamont might also 'argue his
corner very forcefully from the backbenches'.
The prime minister has brought other right wingers into the government,
perhaps to compensate for Mr Leigh's exit. Mr Iain Sproat, a close ally of
Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher until he lost his Aberdeen South seat
in 1983, becomes deputy to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary. Mr
Sproat won the Harwich seat in last year's general election.
Mr Michael Brown, the right-wing MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, has joined
the whips' office.
Some Conservatives regret Mr Major did not make more radical changes. But in
Northern Ireland there was cynicism among local politicians at Mr Major's
decision to move Mr Jeremy Hanley from his job as junior minister with
responsibility for political talks to the Ministry of Defence.
Mr Hanley's replacement is Mr Michael Ancram, the aristocratic Roman
Catholic Conservative MP for Devizes - another former MP who re-entered at
the last election. Although his Catholicism should not be any handicap, the
nuances of Ulster's politics will have to be mastered swiftly if the
government is to re-start talks soon.
A more prominent theme has been the preference given to loyal supporters of
Mr Major. Backbenchers joining the government include the moderate but
astute Mr John Bowis, MP for Battersea, who joins the Department of Health.
Among those promoted were Mr Timothy Yeo, who as MP for Suffolk South is
part of the 'East Anglia Mafia' that increasingly dominates the cabinet,
including Mr John Gummer, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr John MacGregor and Mr
Major himself.
Those criticising Mr Major for not going further in reshaping the government
included Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the normally loyal Tory MP for Leominster.
In further attempts to soothe wounds, Mr William Hague, the former
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Lamont, was appointed a junior
minister at the health department.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Heseltine rejects OFT bus advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has overturned
recommendations by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that South Yorkshire Transport,
a Sheffield bus company, should sell four rival bus companies acquired in
1989, Robert Rice writes.
The company was ordered to sell Sheffield and District Transport, Sheafline
(PSV), SUT and Michael Groves after a 1990 MMC report found the acquisitions
were against the public interest.
Implementation of the recommendations was suspended pending the outcome of a
legal challenge to the report's findings.
After the Law Lords ruled against the company last December the Office of
Fair Trading carried out a review of bus services in the Sheffield area
which concluded that the company should still be required to sell.
Mr Heseltine said yesterday he agreed with Sir Bryan's assessment that
competition concerns remained, but he had decided on balance to ask him
first to try to negotiate behavioural undertakings from the company.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Brent rated lowest for council tax service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Brent provides council
tax-payers with the worst level of customer service in the UK, a survey
published yesterday shows.
BEM Research, a market research company, produced the study by having
'mystery callers' contact each local authority in the UK, asking the same
questions about council tax each time.
In Brent they found a two-hour queue of 170 people, while telephone
inquiries were put on hold for 10 minutes then cut off. In Labour-controlled
Waltham Forest, which finished 413th out of 414 in the survey, a caller was
told: 'We do not deal with any inquiries on Tuesday. We close to catch up
with our paperwork.'
Problems with computer systems were seen as the main difficulty for poor
performers.
Top performers were Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, followed by South
Somerset (Liberal Democrat) and Amber Valley (Labour).
Only 24 authorities scored below 60 per cent on the overall performance
rating used, but many staff were unable to answer basic queries.

FT  29 MAY 93 / ILO condemns anti-union bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WAS condemned by the International Labour Organisation yesterday for
failing to provide effective legal protection for workers facing
discrimination by employers because of trade union activities.
This follows a complaint to the Geneva-based organisation in 1991 by the
Trades Union Congress about a number of trade unionists who were unable to
find a job or were dismissed for being on a recruitment blacklist compiled
by the Economic League, an employer-funded organisation.
The organisation's freedom of association committee ruled that Britain had
breached convention 98 on the right of unions to organise without
discrimination against their members, which it signed in 1949. The judgment
has been ratified by the organisation's governing body.
ILO conventions are not legally enforceable, but countries are not compelled
to sign them and ministers will be embarrassed by the judgment.
Yesterday's ruling is the ILO's ninth judgment against Britain since 1979
for breaching conventions of good labour practice.
The organisation said in a statement that it was urging the government to
extend an express protection in law against blacklisting or other forms of
discrimination against workers who belong to trade unions or have been
active in them in the past.
It said: 'All practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials
or members constitutes a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union
rights, and in general governments should take stringent measures to combat
such practices.'
In response the government said the workers concerned had their rights fully
covered by the 1990 Employment Act, which makes it unlawful for an employer
to refuse to employ somebody for being a trade unionist.
It added that workers who felt victimised could use the civil law to gain
redress. The government also pointed out that the activities of the Economic
League were not unlawful.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Mining group quits race for pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG GROUP, the independent mining company, yesterday said it would not
compete for 20 pits British Coal is putting out to tender. The company was
previously thought to be one of the likeliest bidders.
The leases of the first four were advertised yesterday - Easington,
Bolsover, Cotgrave and Silverhill - although there are likely to be few
bidders.
Mr Brian Calver, chief executive of Young Group, said: 'We do not think
there is sufficient market.'
Mr Calver added: 'It is reasonable to suppose British Coal knows what it is
doing and is getting rid of the 20 with the worst assets and the least
chance of winning markets. We ought to be able to run at lower costs than
British Coal but not to that degree.'
The first four are among the least attractive of the 20 pits British Coal is
putting out to tender over the next few weeks. Bolsover in Derbyshire has
virtually no reserves left.
The advertisements come at the end of a week which has confirmed how
difficult it will be for any mining organisation, in the public or private
sector, to find a market for coal.
In response to a British Coal offer to provide subsidised coal at less than
two thirds of production costs, National Power, the main electricity
generator and the largest consumer of coal in the UK, said it would only
consider how much coal to take in the autumn.
Both National Power and PowerGen, the only other generator in England and
Wales, have coal stocks more than three times higher than they want. If
there were no political pressure on them they would buy no more than they
have already contracted for.
Young Group is saving its energies for the privatisation of British Coal in
two to three years and may make a bid then.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British Coal, is
considering bidding for some of the 20 but none of the first four. 'I do not
think there will be a lot of players,' he said.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, will be pleased if that
remains the case. He said yesterday that he would bid for the licence to run
Easington.
Easington, sunk in 1899, was one of the last two pits in the Durham
coalfield when it ceased production this month. In 1947, when the industry
was nationalised, Durham had 128 collieries employing 108,000 men.
Easington produced 1.3m tonnes of coal last year, which Mr Budge said was of
'beautiful quality' and could be sold into the domestic and industrial
markets. He plans to bid for up to 11 pits in the belief that British Coal's
concentration on the electricity supply market leaves gaps in other markets.
RJB will have its work cut out if it wins the Easington licence. According
to John T. Boyd, the US consultancy, Easington had the least potential of 21
pits it inspected last year as part of the government's review of its pit
closure plans.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Multiple birth adds fuel to NHS rationing controversy: The
world's latest set of surviving sextuplets has sparked a very public ethical
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POTENTIALLY combustible debate about rationing healthcare has smouldered
this week following the birth of sextuplets to a woman who received
fertility treatment.
The fact that the sextuplets are only the sixth surviving set in the world
was soon overshadowed by the revelation that the parents are not married and
do not live together. This has prompted discussion about the ethics of
fertility treatment and, more broadly, whether it should be available in the
National Health Service when financial pressures are high.
Ministers and many NHS managers try to avoid speaking of healthcare
rationing, referring instead to priority setting. The disguised issue
appeared again this week in a report from the Audit Commission on
strengthening the role of healthcare purchasers - district health
authorities, family health services authorities and GP fundholders.
The report said: 'Positive decisions about what to commission should be
openly set alongside any decisions about what is unaffordable.'
In reality treatment is rationed in all healthcare systems, but the NHS's
traditional rationing mechanism - the waiting list - managed to maintain the
illusion that everything was eventually available. But under the 1991
reforms purchasing authorities have to make explicit decisions on the
amounts of treatments they are prepared to buy.
There is growing recognition in the medical profession that rationing is
unavoidable. A significant turning point came last year when the British
Medical Association accepted it as 'an unfortunate fact of life' and called
for it to be formalised by agreement between the Department of Health and
the medical profession.
The government has shied away from establishing national treatment
priorities, however, believing that specific decisions should be taken
locally within broad requirements for treatment to meet the needs of
patients, to offer good outcomes related to quality of life and represent
value for money.
In response a number of health authorities have launched consultation
exercises to involve the public in priority setting decisions. In West
Yorkshire the Bradford and Airedale authorities and their local family
health services authority published details of a draft 1993-94 health plan
in local newspapers and sought comments.
Public responses highlighted concerns that might have gone unconsidered by
planners - such as the need to focus more attention on accident prevention
among elderly people - but also illustrated the difficulty of such
exercises. The greatest number of public objections was to proposed
increases in provision for terminations of pregnancy, chiefly on grounds of
principle.
Another problem with rationing is a lack of consensus about priorities
between doctors and the public. City and Hackney district health authority
in London asked members of the public, GPs and hospital consultants to rank
16 potential services in order of importance.
High-technology operations such as heart and liver transplants, rated fourth
in importance by the public, came 12th in the doctors' rankings. Less
glamorous services such as community care and mental illness provision,
which were among the doctors' top priorities, came much lower down the
public's list. Consensus was reached only at the bottom of the list with
fertility treatment, alternative medicine and cosmetic surgery gaining low
marks.
Final decisions are made by doctors and managers, whose priorities are not
always the same. The doctors' traditional stance is to shun anything that
smacks of making choices between patients, but the increase of managerial
tasks for the medical profession has drawn them into the rationing debate.
Another step towards formal recognition of rationing will be taken this year
when medical students at St Andrew's University become the first in Britain
to take a course in priority setting as part of their professional training.
An all-party group of MPs recently visited the university to examine the
course, which has been running informally this academic year.
Dr Mo Malek, a health economist responsible for the course, said there was a
recognition among young people entering medical training that priority
setting could not be avoided.
He said: 'There was a time when doctors would react with horror on moral
grounds to any suggestion of rationing. But it can be argued that it is
immoral not to ration if a doctor is devoting resources to one patient
without considering the impact on others.
'Acceptance that priorities must be set at least means decisions can be made
in a way that is democratic and open to discussion and criticism.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / College 'efficiency' revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXFORD University and Imperial College, London, are among the 10
universities which make the highest call on public funds per student,
according to figures published yesterday.
Tables produced for the Higher Education Funding Council for England,
published in The Times Higher Education Supplement, show the amounts
received by higher education establishments.
The figures are meant as a broad indicator of efficiency, but they make no
attempt to take quality into account.
They suggest, however, that new universities, which converted from
polytechnics last year, do not deliver their service significantly more
cheaply than older universities.
The 10 costliest general higher education bodies include six former
polytechnics, five of them in Greater London, two colleges of London
University (Imperial and Birkbeck), and Oxford and Essex universities.
The most efficient spender was Chester College of Higher Education, while
the rest of the top 10 included four former polytechnics, three other higher
education colleges, and two 'old' universities.
Among further education colleges, the most expensive higher education
courses were provided by the City of Westminster College, followed by
Westminster College, London, and Hounslow Borough College. The cheapest
further education college was Cordwainers, in Hackney, London, followed by
Worcester and Herefordshire technology colleges. St Bartholomew's Hospital
in London, which is threatened with closure in the autumn, is shown to be
the most efficient specialist institution, while the most expensive were the
Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Art.
The council intends to publish details of relative costs for each subject
next week, but does not intend to publish the broader league table.
The council added that it was not yet fully confident the figures took all
factors of efficiency into account, which was why it had not wanted to
publish them, but said they were the 'best shot yet' at measuring
efficiency.
Members of the council's performance-indicators working party suggested that
funds from other sources should be taken into account, The Times Higher
Education Supplement said.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Claims ruling satisfies Names and Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London and 113 Names - individuals whose assets support the
insurance market - both claimed victory following a Court of Appeal ruling
yesterday.
The case, heard by Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, involved the
rights of Names to recover directly claims on personal stop-loss insurance
policies - personal reinsurance which covers heavy losses.
Lloyd's appealed against an original judgment by Mr Justice Tuckey, made in
March.
He ruled that claims under the stop-loss policies should be paid directly to
Names rather than to the premium trust funds, which contain premium income
earned by Lloyd's underwriters from insurance business.
The appeal court upheld part of Mr Justice Tuckey's original judgment but
said claims under stop-loss policies could not be paid directly to Names
where these policies had been irrevocably assigned by letter or policy
wording to the trust funds.
It also ruled that monies paid into premium trust funds for the purposes of
establishing solvency for the 1991 year could not be returned to Names.
Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor who represented the 113 Names in the case,
said the decision was of 'very great importance' to many Names who 'will now
be able to pay the recoveries to the banks and insurance companies who gave
guarantees to Lloyd's and are now threatening the homes and farms of Names'.
Mr Freeman said the ruling would help another group of Names who are seeking
direct access to tax rebates paid earlier this year by the US tax
authorities.
Lloyd's said that the ruling would bring 'a substantial benefit to its
solvency'.
It said policies which assign any claims irrevocably to the premium trust
funds were increasingly common.

THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board is to recruit a senior official from the
Department of Trade and Industry to help it make accounts easier to
understand.
Mr Michael Butcher, head of accounting and audit policy at the DTI, is to
join the board on secondment for at least a year from August.
He will help to make draft standards issued by the board less wordy and
technical.
He will also start work on a two-to-three-year project producing guidelines
on the inclusion of a statement in annual accounts to clarify financial
information to non-professionals.
Mr David Tweedie, head of the board, has long said he wants to make accounts
more understandable. Critics have accused the ASB of producing standards
that are highly technical and increasingly difficult for non-professional
investors to use.

FT  29 MAY 93 / BA staff on brink of strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS cabin crews and ground staff will strike next week if the
company fails to resolve its differences with them over pay and conditions.
Such a stoppage would ground BA's fleet in the UK and abroad, severely
disrupting schedules.
Informal talks will be held during the weekend between BA and the Transport
and General Workers union that represents the employees. Formal negotiations
are expected on Wednesday.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said the union had decided not to
disrupt BA's holiday traffic because it wished to minimise inconvenience to
passengers and provide 'a breathing space' for BA to resolve long-standing
problems with its staff.
BA last night welcomed the decision not to call a strike during the bank
holiday weekend and said it was 'confident that talks with the TGWU will
avoid any disruption'.
An immediate and indefinite staff travel embargo will be imposed on all BA
flights if industrial disruption occurs, and wide-ranging contingency plans
are ready to try to limit the effects of a strike.
Mr Morris said: 'Should BA fail then strike action will be taken next week
at a time and in a form to be determined.' He made it clear that all the
TGWU's 17,000 members at BA would be involved in any strike.
Union officials are demanding that the airline stop using any more contract
labour in its operations without the agreement of the TGWU. Staff also do
not want inferior terms and conditions imposed on them by newly created
subsidiary companies.
BA says it has no plans to create more subsidiaries without consultation
with the unions, and it will not reduce pay or conditions unless the only
alternative is closure or disposal of parts of the business because of
unsustainable losses.
Mr Morris said he had written to BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall urging
serious talks. He hoped management would 'at long last' seek agreement with
the TGWU in the light of the union's ballot. This had a 51 per cent turnout
of which 62 per cent backed a strike call and 84 per cent supported
industrial disruption short of a strike.
Further pressure can be expected on BA at the end of next week from its
pilots, who are being ballotted on strike action and other forms of
disruption in protest at the alleged imposition of inferior terms and
conditions. The result of that ballot will be announced on Friday.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Heads issue threat over league tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAD TEACHERS are threatening the government with legal action if it carries
out plans to publish league tables based on schools' performance in the
national curriculum tests in England and Wales.
Tests for 14-year-olds are due to start on June 7 but have been boycotted by
the three largest teachers' unions. The National Association of Head
Teachers has said this would make league tables meaningless and it has
advised its members not to help in providing results.
Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, also objects to league
tables of A-level and GCSE results, which were published for the first time
last year and contained several errors.
In a letter to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, Mr Hart said: 'The
NAHT has taken legal advice and has been informed that it would be possible
for a governing body to take legal action against your department's
contractors, and the department itself, if errors, which are not the fault
of the school, are published in respect of the 1993 GCSE and A-level
examinations and national curriculum results.'
Mr Patten refused to comment on the threat of legal action. The Department
for Education said this was 'hypo-thetical'. It said most errors last year
were the fault of schools, not the department.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Britain attacked over bias against trade unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WAS condemned by the International Labour Organisation yesterday for
failing to provide effective legal protection for workers facing
discrimination by employers because of trade union activities.
This follows a complaint to the Geneva-based organisation in 1991 by the
Trades Union Congress about a number of trade unionists who were unable to
find a job or were dismissed for being on a recruitment blacklist compiled
by the Economic League, an employer-funded organisation.
The organisation's freedom of association committee ruled that Britain had
breached convention 98 on the right of unions to organise without
discrimination against their members, which it signed in 1949. The judgment
has been ratified by the organisation's governing body.
ILO conventions are not legally enforceable, but countries are not compelled
to sign them and ministers will be embarrassed by the judgment.
Yesterday's ruling is the ILO's ninth judgment against Britain since 1979
for breaching conventions of good labour practice.
The organisation said in a statement that it was urging the government to
extend an express protection in law against blacklisting or other forms of
discrimination against workers who belong to trade unions or have been
active in them in the past.
It said: 'All practices involving the blacklisting of trade union officials
or members constitutes a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union
rights, and in general governments should take stringent measures to combat
such practices.'
The TUC had alleged that a number of workers had been unable to find work or
had been dismissed by employers shortly after being hired because they
appeared to be on a blacklist of militant trade unionists compiled by the
Economic League.
In response the government said the workers concerned had their rights fully
covered by the 1990 Employment Act, which makes it unlawful for an employer
to refuse to employ somebody because of being a trade unionist.
It added that workers who felt victimised could use the civil law to gain
redress. The government also pointed out that the activities of the Economic
League were not unlawful.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that he had written
to the new employment secretary Mr David Hunt urging him to act on the ILO
decision.
The TUC also intends to appeal to the organisation about the controversial
new amendment that was rushed into the government's Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Bill last week after its committee stage in the House of
Lords.
This amendment allows employers to discriminate against trade unionists by
denying them pay increases if they refuse to sign personal contracts of
employment.
The TUC regards this as a serious threat to union rights.
Mr Willis wrote to Mr Hunt: 'Following the logic of today's decision from
the ILO, Britain would be committing a further violation of ILO convention
98 if it passed into law the amendment introduced into the bill earlier this
week.'

FT  29 MAY 93 / Brent council rates lowest in service study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Brent provides council
tax-payers with the worst level of customer service in the UK, a survey
published yesterday shows.
BEM Research, a market research company, produced the study by asking
'mystery callers' to contact each local authority in the UK, asking the same
questions about council tax each time.
In Brent, they found a two-hour queue of 170 people, while telephone
inquiries were put on hold for 10 minutes then cut off. In Labour-controlled
Waltham Forest, which finished 413th out of 414 in the survey, a caller was
told: 'We do not deal with any inquiries on Tuesday. We close to catch up
with our paperwork.'
Problems with computer systems were seen as the main difficulty for poor
performers, followed by inadequately prepared staff.
Top performers were Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, followed by South
Somerset (Liberal Democrat) and Amber Valley (Labour). Following them were
Ashfield (Labour), the Western Isles (Independent), Gravesham (Split) and
Sunderland (Labour).
Only 24 authorities scored below 60 per cent on the overall performance
rating used, but many staff were unable to answer basic queries. For
example, nearly one fifth of authorities were unable to say how much a
caller was paying in council tax, and 86 authorities could not explain
transitional relief. Local authorities are also preparing to start action
against people who do not pay their tax.
The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation will next week hold meeting
of more than 300 revenue officers to discuss how best this can be done. It
also intends to continue collecting last year's poll tax, 25 per cent of
which remains unpaid in inner London.
Mr Nick Baker, of the IRRV, said: 'Unlike the poll tax there is provision
for those who cannot afford to pay and so there is no excuse for
nonpayment.'
Enforcing the council tax will be much easier than collecting the poll tax,
according to the IRRV.

COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, has shed 49 partners in the last
year, figures released yesterday show. The firm announced the admission of
36 new partners, bringing the total to 702 in May compared with 715 at this

The firm said a disproportionate number of partners had decided to retire,
partly reflecting those taken on when Coopers merged with Deloitte in 1990.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Eagle Trust charges dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARGES BROUGHT against two businessmen in connection with Eagle Trust, the
Midlands mini-conglomerate, were dropped by the Serious Fraud Office
yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director, was due for trial
at Wolverhampton Crown Court on four charges of theft involving Pounds 11.5m
allegedly stolen from the company and one of deception.
Mr Leslie Goodwin, a former chairman of Connect Parcels, the delivery
company, faced two theft charges involving Pounds 11.5m and one of providing
false information.
Not guilty verdicts on all counts were returned at the direction of the
judge.
The trial of Mr Martin Baker, a former Eagle Trust finance director, will go
ahead on September 6. He is charged with four counts of theft involving
Pounds 12.25m.
All three had stood trial with Mr John Ferriday, former Eagle Trust chairman
and chief executive, but proceedings were postponed after the judge ruled
they should be tried separately.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Japan seeks help to stem yen rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government warned yesterday that the yen's rapid appreciation
is jeopardising the country's economic recovery and sought international
intervention to ensure that Japan will be able to contribute to world
growth.
Finance and trade ministers hinted at the need for co-ordinated intervention
following a record close in Tokyo of Y107.38 to the dollar. They said the
currency's fluctuations, blamed on 'speculators,' has undermined a recent
spending package designed to stimulate the ailing economy.
A flood of gloomy profit forecasts this week by Japanese manufacturers
expecting to be hit hard by yen appreciation and a fall yesterday in
employment figures have stirred fears in the government that the recovery
expected in the autumn will not materialise.
The government is particularly concerned because the immediate effect of the
yen's appreciation will be to push the country's already embarrassing trade
surplus even higher, while a continued slowing of the domestic economy would
reduce demand for imports and encourage manufacturers to export.
Mr Masakuni Murakami, the labour minister, said that the ratio of job offers
to applicants fell to 0.84 in April, down from 0.88 in March and from 1.08
last June, and suggested that demand for new employees is still softening
and will 'take some time' to recover.
Working hours also slipped from an average of 44.4 a week in March to 41.3
in April, reflecting companies' attempts to cut costs by reducing overtime
and encouraging employees to take extra holidays. The seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was unchanged at 2.3 per cent.
The electronics sector and car manufacturing are under increasing pressure
from the yen's appreciation.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, said that 'appropriate steps'
should be taken to curb the yen's rise and hinted that Japan would like
co-ordinated intervention by the Group of Seven leading industrialised
nations, which appears unlikely.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Opposition agrees changes to poll system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading opposition parties reached a partial agreement yesterday on
reforming the country's scandal-stained electoral system, putting pressure
on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to produce an acceptable counter
proposal.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, promised last night that he will
pursue reforms to cleanse the political system, but the LDP is divided into
groups for and against change, and it remains unclear in which camp Mr
Miyazawa stands.
Six opposition parties agreed at a summit meeting yesterday that the present
system of multi-seat constituencies is prone to corruption and should be
replaced by a mix of single-seat constituencies and proportional
representation, but they failed to agree on the details of the mix.
The LDP claims to be in favour of a single-seat system, which would ensure
it a comfortable parliamentary majority, and will attempt to shift the
responsibility for reform back to the opposition parties, knowing that they
will not easily reach agreement.
Parliament's present sitting lasts for three more weeks. However the parties
have only a week in which to reach agreement, as politicians will then be
expected to stop haggling in deference to Prince Naruhito, the heir to the
throne, who is to be married in the following week.
Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa is very keen to give the impression that he favours
reform, leaving the task of reaching a consensus to other members of his
divided party, which is missing the calming influence of Mr Shin Kanemaru,
the fallen LDP godfather whose own corruption partly inspired the drive for
reform.

FT  29 MAY 93 / UN brings the vote to Cambodia's outback: The logistics
involved in getting the country's electorate to the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRINGING democracy to the Cambodian outback is no easy task for the United
Nations.
To reach villages like Phum Talat in the remote north-east, you need a
Russian Mi-17 helicopter powerful enough to carry a mobile polling station
and lift itself out of the glutinously muddy rice-fields used as landing
pads.
You need the three Uruguayan soldiers, armed with guns, grenades and dark
glasses, to defend the UN election team in case of attack by Khmer Rouge
guerrillas; the young Australian radio operator; the Ghanaian policeman
wearing little black gumboots and a US army helmet two sizes too big, who
shepherds voters to cardboard voting booths under a mango tree; the Russian
flight crew; and the Cambodian election officers.
You need men like Giuseppe Andreoli of the Italian carabinieri, who jokes
with barefoot women voters while he checks for weapons with a metal
detector, and Lt-Col Surjit Singh, the magnificently moustachioed
international polling station officer, recently retired from the Indian
army.
In 15 minutes the polling station is established. Voters, summoned by shouts
across the fields, arrive on foot or by dugout canoe. The headman of Talat
(population: 193) tells people to vote, and they vote; soon the tables and
chairs are packed to be helicoptered to the next village.
As if confronted by 19th century Christian missionaries, the villagers are
baffled but delighted by the novelty of this week's UN-organised elections.
Some of the communities in this part of Stung Treng province are too small
and too remote even to merit the attentions of government intimidators who
have murdered and threatened opposition politicians across Cambodia.
There are no party agents to monitor the election, and none has been to the
village to campaign. Many people are unaware of the existence of the
government, let alone the opposition parties. They have never voted before
and most are mystified by the ballot papers on which they are supposed to
leave a pencil mark. The last visit by a government official was about two
years back, but Khmer Rouge soldiers came through only three days ago to
borrow a boat to cross the river.
The village has no school and no doctor. Illiteracy and malaria are so
common that UN volunteers question the value of their efforts to preach the
gospel of western democracy to Cambodian peasants.
'It's not very logical in a way to talk about democracy to people who are
dying of malaria,' says Linda Trudel, a Canadian district electoral
supervisor. 'We ask them if they have any questions and they say, 'yes, do
you have any medicine for malaria?''
In these remote and peaceful villages in the jungle, where pot-bellied pigs
grunt contentedly in their mud-wallows and girls aged six smoke home-made
cigarettes, the impact of the UN could be short-lived.
Sixty-seven people voted in Rompot, the last village on Lt-Col Singh's
circuit, although there are only 60 registered voters. 'It's a small
village,' he says. 'People have got nothing else to do.'
Rompot's inhabitants are left with the tables and chairs, and what is
probably the first pollution they have ever known: plastic wrappers from US
military MREs ('Meals Ready to Eat') provided as rations to the election
workers.
Talat and Rompot are also left with the memory of a big white helicopter.
People cluster round to touch the beast which terrified their water buffalo
and peer inside before it disappears again for ever. 'I want,' says one man,
'to buy it.'

China announced early this year that it was opening to foreign exploration
the Tarim basin, in the far-west Xinjiang region. Over 60 foreign companies

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Pakistan's newly reinstated prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif
is expected to present the country's annual budget in mid-June.
The budget is seen as one of the government's most important tests after Mr
Sharif, who had been sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, was swept back
to office on Wednesday by a supreme court decision.
Pakistan's budget deficit for the fiscal year ending on June 30 is estimated
to have risen to over Rupees100bn (Pounds 2.47bn) against a target of
Rupees65bn giving added urgency to this year's budget.
Strains on the economy have also intensified due to a fall in the country's
official and private foreign exchange reserves during the past month, as
businesses became increasingly nervous over the growing political
uncertainty.
Many companies expect that the end of the financial year will see economic
growth falling to just over 4 per cent, from over 6 per cent earlier.
However, the government has not given a recent estimate of economic
performance during the year.
The drop in growth resulted partly from lower agricultural output - last
year's heavy floods caused widespread damage to the cotton crop, considered
the most important among the major crops.
The government is planning a conference in Islamabad soon to assure business
leaders that the economic reform programme remains on track.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH AFRICAN government and the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress
yesterday patched up a row over the arrest of PAC members earlier this week,
allowing multi-party constitutional talks to resume.
The agreement between Pretoria and the PAC involved a government commitment
to free three senior PAC leaders and a parallel accord by the PAC to make
clear by Tuesday whether it supports armed struggle and the guerrilla
campaign of its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army.
A fourth leader, political affairs secretary Jackie Seroke, will be charged
and the government will make a full report on the continued detention of
other PAC members.
The government was forced to release the leaders after a minister was
severely chastised on Thursday by the multi-party body negotiating the
country's post-apartheid constitution.
The 26-party body summoned law and order minister Mr Hernus Kriel to explain
a raid earlier this week in which 75 PAC members were detained. All but 28
remained in custody yesterday afternoon.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the African National Congress,
yesterday pointed out that the Thursday meeting signalled a major shift in
power from the white dominated government to the multi-racial negotiating
forum (which has no executive powers, but has begun to behave as a de-facto
parliament).

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday signed a one-year extension of China's Most
Favoured Nation trade status but backed away from imposing tough conditions
on renewal in 1994.
China yesterday protested nevertheless. It said the attachment of any
conditions for renewing China's trading status next year was an 'open
violation' of a standing agreement and seriously threatened bilateral
relations.
With congressional Democrats by his side, the president has sought a middle
ground between US business interests and a campaign promise to take strong
action on human rights.
The conditions Mr Clinton imposed are not legally binding but simply order
the secretary of state not to recommend another MFN extension unless China
has demonstrated progress on human rights and other issues.
Mr Clinton called on China to release political prisoners, to recognise
Tibet's 'distinctive religious and cultural heritage,' to permit
international radio and television broadcasts into China and follow humane
practices in the use of prison labour.
He said he wanted Chinese progress on nuclear non-proliferation and
eliminating trade barriers.
The president sought to compensate for the absence of tough action with
rhetoric. Bringing human rights into the trade equation is 'a new chapter in
United States policy to China,' he said. He does not want 'to isolate China'
but is 'standing up for American values.'
Congressional leaders, who liked to bash President Bush on the issue were
quick to praise President Clinton's 'leadership.'
'For the first time since the events of Tiananmen Square, nearly four years
ago, we have a president who is willing to act in order to bring about
positive change,' said Senator George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader
and a long time crusader on the issue.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Menem calls for Falklands inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem has ordered an 'immediate' investigation
into war crimes allegedly committed by British troops during the 1982
Falklands War.
His announcement follows fresh allegations of atrocities made this week in
the UK media. Mr Menem promised that, if Argentine defence ministry
investigators found proof of atrocities, 'we are ready to formally take the
issue to the United Nations, the European Community and the Organisation of
American States.'
Mr Menem's announcement marks a shift in Argentine policy. The government,
particularly the army, had ignored claims made by Argentine troops shortly
after the war about atrocities committed by British soldiers.
Officials subsequently played down allegations of war crimes first made in
1991 by British ex-servicemen.
Former British troops have said in books and in media interviews that they
saw troops execute Argentine prisoners after the Battle of Mount Longdon,
one of the bloodiest of the 45-day war.
Meanwhile, an Argentine defence ministry official said yesterday that his
department began an inquiry of its own last year, in reaction to British
investigations, but said it 'did not get very far.'
The ministry asked Argentine witnesses to come forward with evidence of
atrocities, but received only a few calls from ex-combatants, one of whom
claimed to have been shot at close range after the Battle of Mount Longdon.
Most of the investigations have been carried out by Britain's ministry of
defence and crown prosecution service. Negotiations are under way to allow a
visit to Argentina by Scotland Yard detectives to question ex-combatants.

FT  29 MAY 93 / House nudges Clinton to the right: Jurek Martin sees a
strategic shift in direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton took a number of disparate decisions between the
small hours of Thursday morning and the relief of seeing the House of
Representatives pass his deficit reduction package in the evening. Taken
together they may represent at least a tactical and possibly a strategic
shift in the direction of a presidency that has seemed of late not always to
know where it was going.
The Democrats hung together to pass the budget bill essentially because they
stared into the abyss of failure and drew back. A defeat would have been
catastrophic not only for Mr Clinton but for the party, which has to prove,
as congressman after congressman said in the course of the impassioned
debate, that it is capable of governing after 12 years in opposition.
In the event the 219-213 victory was less of a squeaker than the voting
numbers implied. Once the necessary majority had been secured, several
Democrats, protecting their rear, cast a free vote against the bill. This
does not mean that the Senate, more independent-minded, more evenly divided
and likely to add another Republican seat next month from Texas, will go
along meekly. But at least the president's prospects of obtaining
legislation that he can live with look a little better.
This is because Mr Clinton decided in the early hours compromise on the bill
to cast his lot with the centre-right of his party at the expense of
traditional liberals. He accepted some limitations on social spending and
bought the twin arguments that the energy tax, as now proposed, might be
liable to modification and that the mix of tax rises and spending cuts might
at the end of the congressional process lean more heavily on the latter.
This might seem rough justice for the liberals who have generally been more
supportive of the president than the critical centre. But the balance of
power in Congress, and, as last year's election showed, in the country at
large, remains averse to the conventional liberal agenda. By distancing
himself from it Mr Clinton also opens up the possibility of prising loose
some moderate Republicans in the battles still to come on the budget and on
health care.
His own political roots lie in what might be called the radical centre and
he was elected on the premise that he was 'a new kind of Democrat,' intent
on making a leaner government work better but not to the extent that it
interfered with the assertion of individual responsibilities.
These principles and Mr Clinton's well developed populist instincts have
seemed obscured of late, not least by his association with what are
perceived as elitist Hollywood liberal causes. Mr Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire and independent candidate in last year's presidential election,
gave a TV interview on Thursday savagely and personally critical of the
president.
But also on Thursday Mr Clinton took a step back from another liberal (and
Hollywood) cause - the complete ending of the ban on homosexuals serving in
the military - by stating that the government should not 'appear to be
endorsing a gay lifestyle.'
He said he was inclined to favour the 'don't ask, don't tell' compromise,
under which military recruiters would stop inquiring about sexual preference
in return for limitations on homosexual behaviour by serving men and women.
Although this has been advanced by Congressman Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, one of only two openly homosexual House members, it falls far
short of demands of the gay lobby.
The president's decision to extend China's most favoured nation trading
status with only the mildest of human rights caveats also breaks a campaign
promise designed to bring liberals on board.
The next obvious test concerns his nomination of Ms Lani Guinier to be
assistant attorney general in charge of civil rights. She is black, a leader
in the civil rights movement, a brilliant law professor from the University
of Pennsylvania and a Yale classmate of the Clintons.
But some of her written work on voting rights in the context of the causes
of minorities is considered radical even by Democrats and her confirmation
may be obtained only by the expenditure of much political capital, which Mr
Clinton still cannot spend too freely. A similar caution may apply to his
imminent nomination of a new Supreme Court justice, now likely to be a
middle-of-the-road judge from the federal system.
Moving away from the liberals is not cost-free. It makes more difficult
agreement on the energy tax and congressional approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement. It will require the president to find ways of offering
more to the inner cities. It may mean offending Ms Barbra Streisand and her
Hollywood set. But the consequences of not doing so now appear to the
president to be far worse.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Thai motorway dispute escalates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW between the Thai government and a consortium building an urgently
needed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 643m) elevated motorway in Bangkok escalated
yesterday with the government's demand that the road be opened tomorrow even
though it is unfinished.
The government said the motorway had to be opened because the traffic jams
in Bangkok had 'become unbearable and (were) considered an immediate
national crisis.' But the consortium's engineers say opening two-thirds of
an incomplete road is more likely to disrupt than ease traffic flows in the
capital.
Mr Takao Ninomiya, managing director of Bangkok Expressway, the consortium
led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan, said the demand was 'really unexpected and
actually unbelievable.' The consortium countered by offering the government
90-days' free use of the road on condition that it commits itself to solving
the dispute in that time. However, it is refusing responsibility for
accidents on any part of the motorway put into operation before final
completion.
Because the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority has been slow to deliver land,
four of the 18 exit and entry ramps remain 'ski-jumps.' Six others have no
traffic lights or road markings.
In what is considered a vital test case because of the huge investment
needed in Thai infrastructure, consortium members and banks accuse the
government of breaking its contract, notably with a decision to cut the
previously agreed toll fee because of political opposition within the ruling
coalition. Government ministers admit failing to stick to the letter of the
contract but say foreign investors are financially protected.
Foreign and Thai banks which committed Bt20bn (Pounds 518m) to the project
have suspended loan disbursements to the consortium since March because of
the row.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community plans to limit the working week to 48 hours are set to be
agreed next week, following high-level negotiations between the European
Commission and the British government, whose opposition has blocked the
proposal for three years.
UK officials confirmed yesterday 'it is likely that we will not vote
against' the working time directive when employment and social affairs
ministers meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday.
Britain last year secured a partial opt-out, giving it a 10-year grace
period to implement the 48-hour week, whereas its 11 partners would have to
comply within three years. But the UK would, for the first time, have to
give legal protection to workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours,
and to bring in legislation on mandatory time off.
Throughout the long tussle over this flagship of the EC's Social Charter,
the British government has insisted it would not accept any obligation to
limit working time, either now or in the future, claiming the measure would
add Pounds 5bn to the costs of UK industry.
But following talks between Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs
commissioner, and British ministers, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
is understood to have sanctioned abstention on the directive.
The UK, however, is still fighting for total exclusion from the rules for
all work at sea, and for doctors in training.
Britain will also come under pressure on Tuesday over EC plans for mandatory
works councils in big, trans-European companies.
Its 11 partners are agreed in principle to go ahead with the measure under
the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty if Britain - which is exempt
from these more ambitious provisions - continues to hold it up.
The directive would oblige companies with more than 1,000 workers in more
than one member state to set up elected works councils, which would have to
be consulted on investment, relocation and jobs plans.
The UK is flatly opposed to obligatory consultation of workers, but is
negotiating in micro-detail through the directive's provisions, keeping open
the option of an eventual compromise.

THE NEW conservative government of France yesterday faced a setback in its
attempts to curb unemployment, with the news that the level of joblessness
rose by 1.5 per cent last month, to just below 11 per cent of the total
workforce, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
There were more than 45,600 job losses in France during April, according to
the employment ministry, bringing the total number of unemployed to a record
3.11m.
The depth of the French economic downturn was highlighted yesterday when the
LVMH luxury goods group announced it was shedding 89 employees at its
Pommery champagne business.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and France yesterday forcefully rejected claims that the Western
powers and Russia had endorsed Serb territorial conquests in Bosnia.
In a visit to Paris, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, strongly defended
Britain and France against charges that, in the recent Washington
declaration, they were condoning Serb aggression. It was 'a plan for
pressure until such time as the Serbs disgorge their (land) gains,' he said.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said: 'Things are perfectly
clear. We do not accept any fait accompli.'
Mr Major also stressed the convergence of UK-French interests and roles,
arising in general out of the two countries' status as UN Security Council
members and nuclear weapon states, and in particular from their common
involvement in the Bosnian crisis.
In talks with Mr Balladur, and at lunch with President Francois Mitterrand,
Mr Major said he had largely sought to intensify co-operation in areas where
the two countries were in agreement - such as enlarging, decentralising
decision-making and reinforcing security co-operation in the EC.
'It was not a day for short-term decisions, but for long-term planning,' Mr
Major said, adding that he hoped to further improve UK-French relations,
which were 'in better shape' than at any time he could recall. He said he
had invited the French president and prime minister to London on July 26 for
the first full UK-French summit since 1991.
Mr Balladur said the two leaders had ordered a special effort to try to
bridge their differences in the Gatt talks, essentially over France's
insistence on tying an agricultural deal with the US, satisfactory to French
farmers, to non-farm aspects of world trade talks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday began the search for a new
government after the country had been plunged into renewed political
uncertainty by the surprise one-vote defeat of the coalition headed by Ms
Hanna Suchocka.
Ms Suchocka, Poland's fifth prime minister since the end of communist rule
in 1989, handed her government's resignation to Mr Walesa after losing the
no-confidence vote called by the Solidarity trade union group. Her defeat
comes as the economy is showing signs of growth.
Some ministers leaving an emergency cabinet session after the vote said Mr
Walesa had refused to accept the prime minister's resignation.
The Polish constitution now passes the initiative to the president. He can
ask Ms Suchocka or another politician of his choice to try to form a new
government, or can dissolve parliament and call a new election.
The constitution also empowers him to form his own presidential government
if other options fail.
Mr Walesa did not disclose his intentions after the vote but issued a
statement saying he would fulfil his constitutional role.
Mr Bronislaw Geremek, parliamentary leader of Ms Suchocka's Democratic Union
party, said: 'I expect early elections, the date of which will be set by the
president.'
He has been leading efforts to broaden the base of the coalition. The
initial seven-party coalition was formed in July last year. One partner, the
small PL peasants' party, dropped out last month.
The government never enjoyed a clear majority in the 460-seat Sejm, the
lower house of parliament. The coalition could only count on 186 votes and
always had to rely on opposition abstentions or the support of the smaller,
non-governmental parties.
Yesterday, a handful of government supporters, including Mr Zbigniew Dyka,
recently sacked as justice minister, failed to vote in parliament, allowing
the no-confidence motion to attain half the votes cast, plus one, needed to
win.
Supporters of the no-confidence vote, including the former communists who
had sought a deal which would have allowed them to abstain, numbered 223,
against 198 backing the government. There were 24 abstentions.
The Solidarity union called the vote in protest at the government's refusal
to amend the budget so as to provide higher pay for teachers, nurses and
other public servants whose living standards have fallen due to the
government's tight fiscal policy.
The government is restrained by its agreement with the International
Monetary Fund from raising the budget deficit beyond the equivalent of 5.5
per cent of GDP. This restriction must also be obeyed if Poland is to
complete negotiations for a 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 12.1bn
(Pounds 7.8bn) debt to the London Club of commercial bank creditors.
Polish debt traded on the secondary market in New York fell slightly, to 30
cents in the dollar from 31 cents on Thursday, following the vote yesterday.
This indicated market confidence that the event will not adversely affect
debt negotiations which are due to resume in Paris on June 8.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Hopes for Gonzalez ride on last television debate
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST week of the closest Spanish election campaign in living memory will
start on Monday with the conservative opposition ahead in opinion polls and
government hopes resting on the final television debate between Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, socialist prime minister, and Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the
conservative People's Party.
Unless the former can reverse his public defeat at the hands of Mr Aznar in
the first TV debate last Monday, he is given little chance of being able to
form a government after the election on June 6.
As Mr Gonzalez faces up to what will be his most anxious week in politics,
he was at least freed yesterday of having to worry about a further serious
attack on the peseta.
After sharp falls on Wednesday and Thursday, the currency began trading
yesterday at about Pta70.4 to the D-mark, just below its new parity of
Pta79.11, before the Bank of Spain nudged interbank rates up slightly and
brought speculation to a halt at Pta79.27 to DM1.
Many analysts believe the first debate has already sunk Mr Gonzalez and his
socialist party. He was badly prepared and had underestimated his opponent.
The prime minister's fortunes are likely to depend on his personal
performance, not on Mr Aznar's weaknesses.
Even so, polls still put the socialists and the PP close to each other,
despite the peseta devaluation two weeks ago and the first TV debate. A poll
to be published on Sunday in the newspaper El Mundo is understood to show
the PP leading by about 1.5 points, unchanged from 10 days ago.
As a series of small bombs set by the extreme-left terrorist group Grapo hit
targets in Madrid yesterday, the socialist party continued to insist it can,
in one last week of aggressive campaigning, hold the PP to a draw at least.
Parliament is to meet for the first time after the election on June 29 and,
if the result has been close, the socialists and the PP will have spent the
intervening period lobbying regional parties for support in forming a
government.
The communist-led United Left (IU) may yet be important in this. Polls give
it more than 11 per cent of the vote, which could hand the IU some 25 seats
and make it the third largest party in parliament.
Last night, Mr Julio Anguita, IU leader and secretary-general of the
communist party, was admitted to hospital in Barcelona with an angina
attack. An IU official said Mr Anguita, aged 50, would take no further part
in the election campaign and rest in hospital for a week.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday prepared for possible further terrorist attacks after
Thursday's car bomb explosion in Florence which killed five people and
seriously damaged one of the two main wings of the famous Uffizi gallery.
The Italian government yesterday said the mafia was behind the attack, but
did not exclude the possibility that other organisations could also be
involved in a determined campaign of terror to destabilise the country.
In yesterday's parliamentary debate a number of senators questioned whether
dissident elements in the security services and former members of the P2
secret masonic lodge, behind terrorist acts during the 1970s and early
1980s, were involved in the incidents.
The authorities believe they are up against a group or groups with a
well-defined strategy, unafraid to take lives or attack priceless artistic
treasures. Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, told parliament the
mafia had a hand in wanting to create a climate of tension. Their aim was to
distract the authorities from their increasingly successful battle against
organised crime. He did not rule out links with international organised
crime
The Italian cabinet yesterday agreed to provide L30bn (Pounds 13.16m) in
immediate funds to ensure the Uffizi could open to the public as soon as
possible, albeit on a limited basis.
The authorities have revealed no hard proof of mafia involvement in this
bombing or that in Rome on May 14.
Mr Mancino said links existed between the car bombing in Florence and the
one n Rome which injured 23 people. In both instances forensic experts have
found traces of the same explosive material also used in another unexplained
act of terrorism, the bombing of the Naples-Milan train on December 23, 1984
killing 15 and injuring 200.
The interior minister said the Rome explosion occured on national police day
while the Uffizi bomb went off on the day interior ministers were meeting to
discuss combating the drugs trade.
The Rome bombing was a message primarily directed against an Italian
audience, while the Florence explosion was intended to produce
reverberations world-wide, he suggested. He also maintained the bombings
were too close together to be coincidental.
The car used to carry more than 100kg of explosive was apparently stolen the
day before, as was a second get-away vehicle. Mafia experts said this was
contrary to normal mafia practice.
In the four major terrorist acts since 1974, the courts have failed to pin
final responsibility on anyone. Only this week the 50,000 page file was
closed on the May 28, 1974 bombing in Brescia (8 dead, 90 injured) after
eight separate inconclusive trials since 1978.
In Florence yesterday unions organised a protest and a crowd of over 100,000
heard calls for people to refuse to be cowed by the threat of terrorism.
Elsewhere in Italy stoppages were staged in solidarity with the victims.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Biggest Spanish union cold-shoulders socialists: Tom Burns
charts a decline in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S biggest union, the General Union of Workers (UGT), has pursued for
years its self-appointed task of steering the government of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez along the road of socialist virtue. Now, though, the union ruefully
admits that its efforts have failed and it has refused to endorse the prime
minister's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) for the general election
on June 6.
The UGT had already distanced itself from Mr Gonzalez - its lack of support
in the 1989 election helped to lose the socialist party some 800,000 votes
and 10 seats in parliament - but its hostility has now gone further.
Mr Nicolas Redondo, the union's veteran secretary-general, recently
underlined the divide by inviting Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the
conservative People's Party (PP), to the UGT Congress and by sending one of
the union's senior executives to the PP convention.
The union's leaders feel betrayed by Mr Gonzalez's brand of market-oriented
socialism. 'The government has broken promises it made to us and has been
systematically against what we stand for,' says Mr Jose Mara Zufiaur, a
member of the UGT executive.
'On social issues, Gonzalez has the sensitivity of a clam,' Mr Redondo once
said of the prime minister.
It was all very different in 1982, when Mr Gonzalez first swept to power in
a landslide at the polls. The UGT then helped to draft the socialist party's
manifesto and Mr Redondo was one of half a dozen senior union members to win
a parliamentary seat for the PSOE.
Within a year, however, he and Mr Gonzalez were quarreling over the
government's delay in introducing a 40-hour work week - a campaign promise.
By 1985, Mr Redondo had resigned his seat when the government announced
pension cuts. The union leader's 'insensitive clam' jibe was recalled by Mr
Aznar in a televised debate with Mr Gonzalez this week. 'The unions no
longer believe you,' the PP's champion said as he berated the prime minister
for failing to cement agreements on wages and social policies.
Mr Gonzalez's economic team says the UGT and the communist-leaning union,
the Workers' Commissions, are responsible for soaring labour costs crippling
Spain's competitivity and for spending programmes widening the budget
deficit. The unions contend that real wage increases have lagged behind
productivity and that the rise in government expenditure is caused by the
administration's inability to reduce unemployment.
Mr Zufiaur says the government's introduction of six-month work contracts
has served to worsen unemployment by creating a growing pool of casual
workers shifting between short-term jobs and the dole.
'What most angers Redondo,' says an old friend of the 64-year-old former
steel worker, 'is that Gonzalez never tried to maintain a fluid and open
dialogue with the unions, either on a personal or on an institutional
level.' Mr Zufiaur recalls a bitter exchange when the UGT sought to obtain
more union participation in public companies: 'Gonzalez said we would make
them uncompetitive and that was that.'
Mr Zufiaur reckons the social policy enacted during the past decade has been
due to union pressure, including a one-day general strike in 1988.
Among the 'conquests' claimed by the UGT and the Commissions after the
strike were pensions for some 200,000 of the elderly who had never made
social security contributions and a rise from Pta250 (Pounds 1.30) to
Pta3,000 in monthly child benefits for some 2m Spaniards who earn less than
Pta1m (Pounds 5,130) a year.
Blue-collar workers are unlikely to vote for the PP but, if Mr Aznar gains a
workable majority on June 6, UGT leaders will be among those he ought to
thank.
'We are on the left,' Mr Zufiaur says, 'but many of us are going to abstain,
cast blank votes or vote for (the communist-led group) United Left.'

FRANCE'S new conservative government yesterday faced a setback in its
attempts to curb unemployment, with the news that the level of joblessness
rose by 1.5 per cent last month to just below 11 per cent of the workforce,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
There were more than 45,600 job losses in France during April, according to
the employment ministry, bringing the total number of unemployed to a record
3.11m.
The depth of the economic downturn was highlighted yesterday when the LVMH
luxury goods group announced it was shedding 89 employees at its Pommery
champagne business. LVMH earlier made 245 redundancies at the Moet et
Chandon and Mercier champagne houses, which sparked stormy protests earlier
this week.
The government itself yesterday came under fierce criticism from trade
unions following Thursday's disclosure that it plans to reduce the number of
civil servants at the rate of 1.5 per cent a year from the present tally of
2.1m.

<TEXT>
PLANS ARE being drawn up for the partial privatisation of Russia's
under-capitalised gold mining industry at a time of continuing uncertainty
for potential foreign investors, according to Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, chairman
of Russia's committee for precious stones and metals.
Mr Bychkov said gold output had fallen 6 to 7 per cent last year to 146
tonnes, a level of output which he hoped would be maintained this year. He
also said he believed the level of exports would 'not significantly' change
from the 98 tonnes sold abroad last year, the proceeds of which were paid to
producers. He said official reserves held by his committee came to 200.5
tonnes in May while those held by the central bank had totalled 133 tonnes
in January.
Mr Bychkov said the specifications for privatisation of gold production
would be contained in a decree now being drafted for President Boris
Yeltsin. But he ruled out large-scale transfer of shares to workers because
the industry needed big capital investment which employees could not afford.
The only items to be excluded from privatisation would be sorting and
refining operations, he said.
He did however reverse an earlier statement saying that no foreign companies
should be able to exploit Sukhoi Log, the country's biggest hard-rock gold
deposit.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Bundesbank resistance grows to further cuts in interest
rates

RESISTANCE to further interest rate cuts is growing among Bundesbank
policymakers alarmed by rapid money supply growth and ballooning public
sector deficits.
The heads of three state central banks, all members of the Bundesbank
central council, yesterday spoke out against relaxing monetary policy
despite more evidence that the recession has yet to ease.
The engineering industry reported an 11 per cent year-on-year drop in orders
during April, while the federal statistics office said turnover in the
wholesale trade fell a real 5 per cent in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, the west German inflation rate fell in line with expectations to
a provisional 4.2 per cent in May, compared with 4.3 per cent in April, and
the Bundesbank's medium-term target of 2 per cent.
According to Mr Guntram Palm, president of the Baden-Wurrtemberg central
bank, there was no further room for rate cuts because the M3 measure of
money supply growth overshot the Bundesbank's target range last month.
There was a danger that the May figure would also exceed the upper limit of
6.5 per cent, he said.
Mr Dieter Hiss, of the Berlin and Brandenburg bank said a pause in the
recent series of small cuts could be in order in the light of monetary
developments and the D-Mark exchange rate.
The German currency's advance against the dollar had come to an end, he
said, and it was no longer so strong within the European monetary system.
Although recent signs of weakness were not a 'trend', he said, the D-Mark's
strength had to be protected by monetary policy when necessary.
Yesterday's comments had a significant impact on financial markets, forcing
dealers to scale down their expectations of German rate cuts while
strengthening the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The D-Mark strengthened against all currencies, pushing the dollar down 2
1/2 pfennigs on the day to a close of DM1.5870.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, said
there would probably be little further reduction in German interest rates in
the next six weeks.
'That will make it difficult for European countries to reduce interest
rates, and may trigger new tensions inside the ERM in the longer term,' he
said.
The comments by Bundesbank central council members coincided with renewed
opposition to any more relaxation from Mr Lothar Muller of Bavaria, who
earlier this week criticised money supply growth rates and ever-growing
public sector deficits, and said rates would not be cut for some months.
The central bank council has been shaken in the past two weeks by the
unexpected surge in April M3 and the sharp upward revision of Bonn's budget
deficit estimates.
Germany's ruling coalition ignored yesterday the protests of industrial
lobbies and agreed to impose a surcharge on workers and employers to finance
the growing cost of health care for the elderly, writes Ariane Genillard in
Bonn.
The plan will pay for residential care for 1.1m elderly persons.
It foresees an initial 1 per cent surchage - shared equally between
employers and employees - on income, starting January 1, 1994. It will rise
to 1.7 per cent on January 1, 1996.

FT  29 MAY 93 / EC set to agree on working hours

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community plans to limit the working week to 48 hours are set to be
agreed next week, following high-level negotiations between the European
Commission and the British government, whose opposition has blocked the
proposal for three years.
UK officials confirmed yesterday that 'it is likely that we will not vote
against' the working time directive when employment and social affairs
ministers meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday.
Britain last year secured a partial opt-out, giving it a 10-year grace
period to implement the 48-hour week, whereas its 11 partners would have to
comply within three years. But the UK would, for the first time, have to
give legal protection to workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours,
and to bring in legislation on mandatory time off.
Throughout the long tussle over this flagship of the EC's Social Charter,
the British government has insisted it would not accept any obligation to
limit working time, either now or in the future, claiming the measure would
add Pounds 5bn to the costs of UK industry.
But following talks between Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs
commissioner, and British ministers, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
is understood to have sanctioned abstention on the directive.
The UK, however, is still fighting for total exclusion from the rules for
all work at sea, and for doctors in training.
Britain will also come under pressure on Tuesday over EC plans for mandatory
works councils in big, trans-European companies.
Its 11 partners are agreed in principle to go ahead with the measure under
the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty if Britain - which is exempt
from these more ambitious provisions - continues to hold it up.
The directive would oblige companies with more than 1,000 workers in more
than one member state to set up elected works councils, which wold have to
be consulted on investment, relocation and jobs plans.
The UK is flatly opposed to obligatory consultation of workers, but is
negotiating in detail the directive's provisions, keeping open the option of
an eventual compromise.
If its partners were to go ahead with their own plans, British companies
would still be among those most affected.
More than 100 UK companies in continental Europe would fall under the
proposed rules, and multinationals based in Britain and on the continent are
likely to face pressure from their workers to offer the same consultation
rights in the UK as in the rest of the EC.
The European employers federation, UNICE, has attacked the cost of
organising the consultation meetings required by the directive.
However, senior Commission officials insist that the cost would not be more
than Ecu10 (Pounds 7.78) per year per worker, and would be offset by
increased productivity flowing from improved industrial relations.

<TEXT>
MRS Grete Schickedanz, 'the first lady of the German economy', has given up
her last business commitments at the age of 81.
As head of the family which owns the Gustav und Grete Schickedanz group, a
mail-order, retailing, paper, beer and banking concern with around DM18bn
(Pounds 7.10bn) annual sales, she is one of the most celebrated business
people in Germany.
The unofficial 'first lady' title was conferred by Mr Richard von
Weizsacker, the federal president, and earned through her adventurous,
innovative style.
In 1975, for example, she successfully established the Quelle mail-order and
retailing business in Hungary.
Quelle was also one of the first west German companies to invest in the
former GDR after unification.
A DM1bn investment programme, still under way, was established to create
5,000 jobs.
Quelle, meaning 'source', as started in the 1920s by Gustav Schickedanz, and
bombed out of business during the war. Mrs Schickedanz, who married her boss
in 1942, restarted the family business with a single shop in 1946, and took
sole control over the developing empire on her husband's death in 1977, when
annual sales were DM8bn.
After giving up operational management in 1987, she continued active work as
head of the supervisory boards of the main companies in the group. These
posts will now be taken over by her son-in-law, Mr Wolfgang Buhler.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR battled to restore stability to his administration yesterday,
saying British economic policy would not change after this week's
acrimonious departure of Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor.
With an embittered Mr Lamont expected to become a rallying point for
Conservative dissidents, the prime minister said the former chancellor's
caution about British re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism,
and his March budget, would remain government policy.
In spite of Mr Major's attempts to portray Mr Lamont's resignation as a
personal act, cabinet ministers acknowledged that the chancellor's forced
resignation was a symptom of wider disquiet over Mr Major's leadership.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'The body politic
wanted a scapegoat.'
Downing Street officials suggested that this week's reshuffle was
deliberately limited in scope so as to leave maximum room for a more
extensive cabinet shake-up nearer the next general election. They played
down suggestions that Mr Major was worried that Mr Lamont might seek
revenge. Mr Michael Howard, the new home secretary, predicted that the
reshuffle would be seen as 'a turning point in the government'.
But Mr Edward Leigh - a Euro-sceptic sacked as a junior industry minister on
Thursday - predicted that Mr Lamont might 'argue his corner very forcefully
from the back benches'.
For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said voters wanted 'not just
new personalities but a clear rejection of past mistakes and an embrace of
an entirely new economic agenda'.
In Paris, the reshuffle's aftermath overshadowed Mr Major's talks with
French ministers. The prime minister seemed relatively relaxed, though, as
he said Britain's policy on the European exchange rate mechanism would not
be affected by the pro-European Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as
chancellor.
With rightwing Conservative MPs fearing that Mr Clarke will lobby hard for
early British membership, Mr Major emphasised: 'The circumstances for
Britain to re-enter the ERM do not exist at the moment . . . and are
unlikely to do so in the near future.'
Echoing the public sympathy for Mr Lamont of cabinet ministers - many of
whom had been privately urging his replacement as chancellor - the prime
minister paid tribute to his former colleague and campaign manager in the
Tory leadership election.
'We've always worked closely together. We've shared the same policies, the
same hopes, the same dreams about getting inflation down,' Mr Major said.
The former chancellor, he said, had taken much criticism and had borne it
bravely. Mr Major understood the hurt Mr Lamont felt. 'Even politicians are
human,' he commented.
The reshuffle had been needed, he insisted, to bring new talent into the
government and to enable existing ministers to broaden their experience. It
had been right to make the changes now so that the new chancellor could
begin work on the next Budget, the first to combine tax and spending
proposals.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Textile company fined record sum for racial bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YORKSHIRE textile company that threatened to dismiss its night shift
workers, all Asians, for refusing to accept new working practices was found
guilty yesterday of racial discrimination and fined a record Pounds 229,000
by an industrial tribunal.
Mainly white workers on day and evening shifts at John Haggas, a publicly
quoted worsted spinner, had not been threatened with disciplinary action
when they refused to take on the same extra duties last year.
The award, after a three-day hearing, was the largest ever against a single
employer because of the number of plaintiffs. Individually their awards were
not high, the largest being Pounds 4,000.
However, Mr Anthony Morris, the Leeds industrial tribunal chairman, said he
would have considered higher awards if the maximum compensation allowable
had been higher than Pounds 10,000.
Mr Brian Haggas, chairman of John Haggas, which denied racial
discrimination, said: 'Nobody was made redundant. On the face of it, this
seems a very harsh ruling.'
Mr Goolam Meeran, counsel for the workers, most of whom do not speak
English, said he was pleased with the decision. 'I think justice has been
done and more importantly, has been seen to have been done.' The case was
brought to the tribunal with the assistance of the TGWU general union.
Mr Morris, who said the company was guilty of direct discrimination, said it
was clear that the Asian night shift workers were threatened and warned. He
said the steps taken against them were not taken against the white day and
evening shift workers.
He awarded Pounds 1,000 each to 33 workers not affected by the change in
working practices but who received a threatening letter from Mr Haggas
warning that the entire night shift would be closed if their colleagues did
not conform. The remaining 49, who were given final warnings, were awarded
Pounds 4,000 each. Mr Robert Ginty, the general manager, said the extra work
was introduced to stave off the effects of recession and disciplinary
measures were brought against the night shift because it was thought they
would offer opposition.
Mr Morris said the company had a history of maintaining a racial split in
its workforce. He ordered the company to adopt the Race Relations Code of
Practice on equal treatment of the workforce.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Fresh doubts over US recovery: Clinton's budget bill victory
marred by sharp drop in growth rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's celebration yesterday of his vital budget bill
victory in Congress on Thursday night was tempered by new figures that cast
fresh doubts on the US economic recovery.
They showed much reduced economic growth as American consumers stopped
spending and a deeper balance-of-payments deficit in the first quarter.
Seeking to build public momentum for his economic policies, the president
told a large crowd in Philadelphia that the US 'must stop reducing our
investments and running up our debts'. He also insisted that the impact of
his controversial energy tax would be more than offset by lower interest
rates and that 'there will be no new taxes without budget cuts'.
Revised figures, released by the Commerce Department, showed gross domestic
product expanding at an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent, half the rate
estimated last month and sharply down on the 4.7 per cent recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year.
The latest signs of a US slowdown follow recent downward revisions to growth
forecasts for continental Europe and will increase concern in western
capitals about global growth. They will add to tension when economics and
trade ministers from industrial countries meet in Paris next week at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to discuss rising
unemployment and protectionism ahead of the July Group of Seven economic
summit.
The figures may also increase opposition in the US Senate to elements of Mr
Clinton's deficit-cutting economic plan, which involves the largest tax
increase for a decade.
Share prices retreated on the bad economic news after record highs earlier
this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 27.4 points down at
3,527.43.
On Thursday, Mr Clinton just avoided a potentially calamitous defeat when
the House of Representatives approved a bill that would raise taxes by
Dollars 250bn (Pounds 162bn) and cut spending by Dollars 87bn over five
years. Many Republicans and conservative Democrats, however, are pushing for
bigger spending cuts on the ground that higher tax rates on individuals and
companies will retard economic growth.
The downward revision of first-quarter GDP was sharper than expected on Wall
Street and mainly reflected the US's poor trading performance in the first
quarter. Balance-of-payments figures showed a merchandise trade deficit of
Dollars 29.1bn against Dollars 17.8bn in the first quarter of last year.
Imports rose 12 per cent in cash terms over the period.
Most economists have shaved growth forecasts for this quarter but still
predict a rebound in the second half to growth at an annual rate close to 3
per cent.
Mr Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, theNew York investment
bank, said the economy was likely to grow at an annual rate of about 1.5 per
cent in the current quarter. 'My big concern is the surge in imports which
should not be happening when our currency and cost structure is
competitive.'
The weak growth figures follow reports of a sharp drop in consumer
confidence this month. They make a tightening of monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve improbable in the near future in spite of an upward blip in
consumer and producer prices.
The Fed intervened in foreign exchange markets again yesterday to try to
slow the yen's rise. But at the close in New York the dollar had slipped to
Y106.95 against an opening of Y107.55.

FT  29 MAY 93 / ADT's Ashcroft paid Pounds 2m in 1992 despite shares slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive of ADT, the Bermuda-based
security and car auction company, was paid more than Pounds 2m in 1992,
according to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
During 1991 and 1992 ADT's market capitalisation has nearly halved to about
Pounds 617m. Details of Mr Ashcroft's salary emerged as ADT entered the last
stages of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 833m) refinancing with its banks and
preference share holders.
His service agreement states that 'his salary shall not be reduced' although
he or the company can give 12 months notice terminating the contract.
The 1992 payment was made up of Pounds 1.44m in salary and Pounds 596,000
paid in trust for Mr Ashcroft in lieu of retirement and death benefits. His
salary was the same in 1991 and Pounds 1.2m in 1990.
The compensation package makes Mr Ashcroft better paid than most chief
executives in the FT-SE 100. ADT made a pre-tax profit in 1992 of Dollars
116m and a pre-tax loss of Dollars 460m in 1991.
It is understood the ADT board has approved a new five-year service
agreement with Mr Ashcroft, details of which are unlikely to be made
available until the company files details of its annual report with the SEC
next May.
ADT has had a rocky recent stock market history. While the quality of its
core security and car auction businesses has not been called into serious
question, the group has stumbled on a string of non-core investments.
These have included stakes in Christies, the auction house, and LEP, the
freight and security company, on which the company has lost money.
Mr Ashcroft, who established close links with the Conservative party, fell
badly out of favour in the City during 1991. Unable to keep up with ADT's
stream of non-core investments and inter-company transfers of assets and
debts, he was described by analysts as 'too clever by half'.
The share price fall was not simply due to a loss of confidence in the City.
In April 1991 the company was hit with a lawsuit from Laidlaw of Canada, its
largest shareholder.
The suit claimed ADT had produced 'an illusory profit stream' but was
dropped, apparently in return for board representation.
Mr Ashcroft transformed ADT in the late 1980s from a string of office
service companies with low margins to a company with leading positions in
the security market in the US and in car auctions on both sides of the
Atlantic.
But the cost of buying these businesses was partly met through the issue of
convertible preference shares which included put options, exercisable in
1994, significantly above the current share price of 560p.
Some Dollars 435m falls due under the convertibles issue and the balance of
the Dollars 1.3bn being covered in the refinancing was due to banks from
1995. ADT said in the documents filed with the SEC that if the refinancing
was not implemented it would cut capital spending or 'if necessary consider
the disposition of operating businesses in whole or in part'.

FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: NEC battered by downturn in PC
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group battered by the sharp fall in corporate
and consumer demand in Japan, reports its first group loss in nearly two
decades.
The downturn in the domestic computer market, stagnant sales of
semiconductors, high depreciation costs, and severe difficulties in its home
electronics business resulted in a Y37.7bn (Dollars 342.72m) consolidated
loss for NEC.
The loss came as sales fell 7 per cent to Y3,514bn. At the net after-tax
level, NEC consolidated losses totalled Y45.1bn.
Parent company results were better, largely because the results of its
troubled home electronics business are excluded. A substantial proportion of
semiconductor business is also excluded.
Pre-tax profits for the parent company were down 77.3 per cent to Y18.1bn,
on sales that declined 6 per cent to Y2,869bn.
NEC, which is the largest manufacturer of personal computers (PCs) in Japan,
came under severe pressure last year as corporate investment in the country
was stagnant and computer sales suffered under fierce competition from
foreign companies.
NEC was hit by a sharp fall in PC demand late in the year, following the
introduction of lower-priced US PCs into Japan. PCs account for nearly 30
per cent of NEC's computer sales: their sales fell about 7 per cent.
Electronic devices, such as semiconductors, were also down about 7 per cent,
while telecommunications sales dropped 5 per cent.
However, the company expects PC sales volumes to rise 10 per cent this year,
to 1.4m units. At the same time, the Japanese semiconductor market is
forecast to rise 3 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent fall last year.
The company has taken cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in
capital investment from Y190bn in fiscal 1992 to Y140bn this year. It
expects results to recover substantially in 1993-94.
Forecasts are for a 6 per cent rise in parent sales, to Y3,030bn, with
pre-tax profits emerging at Y50bn. Consolidated sales of Y3,700bn are
expected with net profits of Y10bn.
At Mitsubishi Electric, the decline in the semiconductor market and weak
demand for consumer electronic products is blamed for a 5 per cent fall in
parent sales, to Y2,494bn. Pre-tax profits were 47 per cent down to Y32.3bn.
Mitsubishi expects non-consolidated sales in the current year to improve to
Y2,510bn, and pre-tax profits to increase to Y35bn.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Elf warns of sharp fall in
first-half profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF-Aquitaine, the oil and chemicals group high on the list of companies to
be sold off under the French government's latest privatisation programme,
yesterday warned of a sharp fall in operating profits for the first half of
this year.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman and chief executive, told a shareholders'
meeting in Paris that, judging by Elf's performance in the first four months
of this year the level of operating profits for the first six months would
be some 25 per cent lower than the FFr7.9bn (Dollars 1.43bn) in the same
period of 1992.
The group was hit last year by declining oil prices, the French franc's
strength against other currencies and the general effects of the economic
slowdown. It suffered a fall in net profits to FFr6.2bn in 1992 from
FFr9.8bn in 1991, on sales of FFr200bn.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent, who had earlier stated that he hoped Elf would return
to net profits growth in 1993, said the group's performance at the start of
the year had been affected by the 'particularly poor' economic environment.
He said Elf had seen a 'continuation of the last months of 1992 in terms of
the level of economic activity, refining margins and petrochemicals.'
However, he did not comment on how these difficulties would affect his aim
of a return to full-year growth.
Elf's oil activities have been affected by the mild winter, which meant that
stocks remained relatively high, depressing prices and refining margins.
Although its exploration business fared well, the chemicals division
suffered from Germany's cuts in health spending and by the franc's continued
strength.
Mr Le Floch-Prigent said Elf was responding to the competitive climate by
pruning expenditure. The level of investment will be reduced by more than 10
per cent in 1993.

Aboriginal land claims

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Australia yesterday moved to protect MIM Group's ADollars
300m (USDollars 210m) lead and zinc mine in the Northern Territory from
possible Aboriginal land claims.
The move came amid fears in Australia of an avalanche of land claims after a
high court decision recognising the existence of land titles before the
Europeans came in 1788.
The Northern Territory government has filed a bill to override native titles
that might be presented against MIM's titles covering its leases for the
McArthur River project. The bill, backed by Canberra, was filed after
Aboriginal groups in the area threatened to lay claims on the land unless
given infrastructure and compensation packages. The MIM leases reputedly
hold one of the world's largest reserves of lead, zinc and silver.

SHANGRI-LA Asia, the Hong Kong and China hotel arm of Malaysian-born tycoon
Robert Kuok's property and trading empire, is to be floated on the Hong Kong
stock market. It is raising HKDollars 735m (USDollars 95.2m) through a
public offer which values the hotel operations at HKDollars 4.9bn.
This will be the first big hotel flotation in Hong Kong since 1989, and
reflects the industry's recovery from the impact on tourism of the Tiananmen
Square massacre and the Gulf war.
Shangri-La owns net tangible assets valued at HKDollars 6.8bn. They include
two luxury hotels in Hong Kong and six hotels in China, along with a
portfolio of office and residential property. The Kuok's Shangri-La hotel
management business will remain privately-owned.
Shangri-La is issuing 150m new shares, or 15 per cent of the company, at
HKDollars 4.90 per share. Profits are forecast to increase by 64 per cent in
the current year, to HKDollars 365m. This puts the shares on a fully-diluted
price-earnings ratio of 13.4 times current-year earnings, which compares
favourably with the other Hong Kong luxury hotel groups, Mandarin Oriental
and Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels.
The Kuok family will retain 59 per cent of the company after the flotation.

THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, has made a pre-tax loss of
DM515m (Dollars 317.3m) for the six months ended March, against a DM376m
profit a year ago.
Turnover for the period was 9 per cent lower at DM16.44bn. The sharp fall
reflects a 19 per cent sales drop in the group's core steel business.
Production of crude steel last year fell by 22 per cent at Thyssen plants.
Other divisions were slightly less worse off. Sales of manufacturing and
investment goods, produced by Thyssen Industrie, fell by 1 per cent. The
results mostly reflect the downturn in the motor industry, the company said.
Thyssen said prospects for the rest of the year were bleak, with most of
Europe in recession.
First half profits at Preussag, the industrial group, fell 50 per cent, but
this was still a satisfactory result considering market conditions, the
steel and engineering group said, writes Christopher Parkes from Frankfurt.
Net earnings of DM115m, for the six months to the end of March, compared
with DM229m, had been hit by the international steel crisis, it added.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US has taken full control of the Tungsram lighting
joint venture by buying out Magyar Hitel Bank, the main Hungarian minority
shareholder.
GE has acquired Hitel Bank's 24.4 per cent stake in Tungsram to take its
ownership to 99.6 per cent, but neither party would reveal the terms of the
transaction.
The acquisition clears the way for GE to recapitalise the Tungsram venture
and reduce the interest payments which have added to the Hungarian company's
losses.
GE expects to make the infusion, of about Ft17bn (Dollars 193m), in June and
for the results to show up in the company's earnings relatively quickly.
GE embarked on the recapitalisation after the venture had suffered Ft9bn in
losses in 1992, its third year of losses in a row.
Magyar Hitel Bank, which is in financial difficulties, opposed the
recapitalisation and insisted that GE take over its shareholding.
The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary to more than Dollars 500m.

<TEXT>
VEBA, the German energy-based conglomerate, is on the verge of selling its
US plastics business, Huls America, shareholders were told yesterday.
The group is also seriously considering following the example of
Daimler-Benz and seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. However,
there is 'no hurry,' Mr Ulrich Hartmann, Veba's new chairman told the annual
meeting.
The proposed disposal of the plastics operations to an unnamed buyer follows
similar rationalisation moves by other German chemicals and plastics
manufacturers which have suffered heavily from the effects of recession and
international over-capacity.
Veba's chemicals divisions recorded an unspecified loss in the first quarter
of this year, in which group net earnings fell 13 per cent to DM201m
(Dollars 123.16m) and pre-tax profits dropped 7.2 per cent to DM513m.
While group sales fell just 1.4 per cent to DM16.5bn, turnover on chemicals
for the quarter were 7.6 per cent lower at DM2.49bn.
A 3.4 per cent increase in volume sales of electricity pushed turnover in
this sec-tor up to DM3.43bn and earnings also rose, the company said.
Oil sector profits fell mainly because of a 'marked loss' from
petrochemicals. Turnover was lower in trading, transport and services but
earnings were unaffected.
Veba said its earnings per share would not show as a big a fluctuation as
overall profit due to dilution effects of new shares.
The number of Veba shares will rise by 2.6m to 48.8m by the end of this
year.

HONGKONG TELECOM, Hong Kong's telecommunications monopoly which is 58.5 per
cent owned by Cable and Wireless of the UK, yesterday announced a 13 per
cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 6.4bn (Pounds 457m) for the year to
March 31.
The outcome was struck on an 18 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars
21.6bn from HKDollars 18.3bn - which included a 23 per cent gain in revenues
from international telephone traffic to HKDollars 13.6bn.
The final dividend of 23.1 cents raises the total for the year 14 per cent
to 43.4 cents.
Analysts said that the growth in profits and revenues indicated that the
underlying trends in the company's main businesses remained extremely
favourable.
It was the growth in Hongkong Telecom's business user base and the volume of
telephony that caught the eye of analysts. Overall growth in installed
services to businesses rose by about 13 per cent compared with the previous
year.
Growth in international telephony was also very strong. Overall it rose by
26.5 per cent, of which services to China grew by 30 per cent. The
significance to Hongkong Telecom of China was underlined by the volume - 44
per cent - of the company's international traffic being calls either to or
from the mainland.
Mr Mike Gale, the company's chief executive, said that he thought Hongkong
Telecom was well placed to participate in telecommunications on the mainland
when the Chinese government decided the time was right to admit foreign
participation.
To date, the Chinese government has said it would not permit foreign
involvement in the ownership, management or operation of telecommunications
services on the mainland.
The company announced a number of changes to accounting practices which had
the effect of reducing the 1993 profit figure. A decision was taken to
accelerate the depreciation of submarine cable technology, which resulted in
an extra charge to the profit and loss account of HKDollars 105m.
In addition, Hongkong Telecom increased its contribution to its staff
pension scheme by a one-off injection of HKDollars 225m and an ongoing
commitment to raise its contribution by an extra HKDollars 127m a year.
The company said its pension fund was underfunded, and that returns earned
by its fund managers had failed to keep pace with the high rate of salary
inflation in Hongkong.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sanderson Murray to expand with Pounds 14m
buy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SANDERSON Murray &amp; Elder, the Yorkshire-based motor distributor, yesterday
announced a Pounds 17.1m rights issue to fund the takeover of Skipper Group,
another northern motor distributor and part of RTZ, the mining group.
Sanderson is paying Pounds 14m in cash for Skipper. It will repay Pounds
11.8m of inter-company debt to RTZ to be replaced with bank borrowings from
Barclays. SME's gearing, currently 26 per cent, will rise to 61 per cent
after the acquisition, but is projected to fall to 50 per cent by the year
end.
Mr Tony Bramall, SME executive chairman, said the acquisition would more
than double the number of dealerships that SME owned and would add three new
manufacturers to its portfolio of franchises.
The 10-for-9 rights of 17.4m new shares is priced at 102p. The shares rose
3p yesterday to close at 120p.
Directors of SME have agreed to take up 4.6m shares and the balance -
underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd - has been placed with institutional
investors. Mr Bramall's 51.7 per cent beneficial holding will fall to 38.1
per cent of the enlarged company.
Skipper was founded in 1961 and floated in 1964. The company incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.05m on turnover of Pounds 196m in 1992.
The loss stemmed materially from the company's contract hire car division
which stopped taking on new business in August 1991. Some contracts have up
to two years still to run.
Skipper, which has net assets of Pounds 14.2m, made an operating profit of
Pounds 900,000 after providing Pounds 596,000 exceptional charges against
the closure of its commercial vehicle businesses. Interest charges amounted
to Pounds 1.5m.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin halved to Pounds 4.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MACDONALD MARTIN Distilleries, producer of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray malt
whiskies, blamed the recession and extreme competitive pricing, particularly
in the blended sector, for a near 50 per cent decline in full year pre-tax
profits.
The company, which had warned shareholders to expect a sharp decline, said
pre-tax profits slumped from Pounds 8.57m to Pounds 4.35m in the 12 months
to March 31.
Earnings per A share fell from 4.88p to 20.38p. However, as expected, the
final dividend is maintained at 6.6p for an unchanged total of 8.8p.
Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, said it had been 'a difficult year for
the industry,' with margins suffering as a direct consequence of pricing
pressures.
Turnover fell by 19.5 per cent to Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 30m) and despite an 8
per cent reduc-tion in costs, operating profits declined by nearly 43 per
cent to Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 9.89m).
Interest payments were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.32m)
with year-end borrowings increasing slightly to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 12.4m),
but gearing remaining steady at 30 per cent.
Shipments of single malt whiskies as a whole were down over the previous
year, mainly because of lower duty free sales in the UK following the
downturn in world travel as a result of the recession, coupled with a change
in agency representation.
Glenmorangie sales increased in the US and Japan, although performance in
Europe was affected by the recession.
Bulk blend shipments, mainly to Australia and the US, fell by 33 per cent in
volume terms to 137,000 cases and by 48 per cent in terms of value.
The average price per litre dropped by 19 per cent as the company was forced
to cut its own prices in response to price reductions in the market.
After allowing for stocking problems, Mr McKerrow said Glenmorangie's
performance in the UK, where sales increased by 9 per cent in value terms
despite a 2 per cent downturn in volume, was in line with the market.
During the year the company also suffered from the downturn in intra-company
trading contracts because of trading conditions in the industry and a number
of contracts did not materialise.
On the outlook Mr McKerrow said it looked like 'another tough year for the
industry and ourselves.' He said production of Glenmorangie was running at a
third of capacity and Glen Moray at 60 per cent, compared with an average of
about 40 per cent for the industry.
He warned that first half results were likely to be below those last year,
but that the second half should show an improvement. For the full year he
expected improved trading profits, offset by the need to write off excess
capacity.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Channel 4 attacks ITV sales effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of Channel 4 yesterday attacked the ITV companies for
apparently underselling Channel 4 advertising in the past three years.
The period coincides with the passage of the 1990 Broadcasting Act, when it
became clear Channel 4 would be selling advertising-time in competition with
ITV. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said: 'It is remarkable that
from 1989, while our audience share continued to grow, ITV suddenly seemed
to have difficulty in selling our advertising effectively.'
In 1992, when Channel 4 had 19.9 per cent of the non-satellite commercial
audience, ITV attributed 14 per cent of its advertising income to Channel 4,
Sir Michael said. This 'by some strange coincidence' matched the 14 per cent
revenue safety net.
Mr Michael Grade , the Channel 4 chief executive, declined to comment on an
industry belief that Channel 4 was taking about 17 per cent of total
advertising.
Channel 4 also confirmed that the BBC paid it Pounds 65,000 after the
departure of Ms Liz Forgan, its former programme director, to be managing
director of BBC Radio. The money repaid a 'golden handcuff' paid to Ms
Forgan.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Companies may be charged over Iraq arms sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is considering two new indictments of US
companies involved in illegal exports of militarily useful equipment to Iraq
during the 1980s, both of which were funded by the Atlanta branch of Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
According to US law enforcement officials, the investigations of both
companies, which are located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are at an
advanced stage.
On Wednesday night the US Justice Department filed arms export charges
against Mr Carlos Cardoen, a Chilean arms maker, and Teledyne, a California
defence contractor. The 21-part indictment concerns the allegedly illegal
export from the US to Chile between 1982 and 1989 of zirconium, a metal made
by Teledyne. The metal was allegedly used by Mr Cardoen to make about 24,000
cluster bombs that were then sold to Iraq.
The Cardoen affair could have repercussions in the forthcoming trial of Mr
Christopher Drogoul, former BNL manager in Atlanta, and also in London,
where the Lord Justice Scott inquiry is investigating Matrix-Churchill, the
Coventry machine tools company that was Iraqi-owned, funded by BNL Atlanta
and worked closely with Mr Cardoen.
Both Mr Drogoul and Mr Paul Henderson, the former Matrix-Churchill managing
director, have said they acted with their governments' approval and briefed
government intelligence services.
Both Teledyne and Mr Cardoen yesterday reacted with anger to the
indictments, saying they held government documents that proved Washington's
knowledge and approval of the exports as part of a tilt toward Iraq in the
1980s.
Teledyne said it would plead not guilty to the charges and would use US
documents to show its exports were known about in Washington.
Mr Roger Zuckerman, a US lawyer for Mr Cardoen, said: 'The very government
that now charges Mr Cardoen as a criminal was supplying weaponry to Iraq.
(It) knew of, approved of, and even solicited the conduct it now deems
illegal.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Uphill struggle before fortunes
reversed - The problems at Ford of Britain despite a cut in losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 29th May 1993) appended to this article.
FORD OF Britain buckled again last year under the heavy pressure of the
recession and the attack of its main rivals on its traditional UK market
leadership.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m for the 1992 year followed losses of Pounds
935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990, both of which were exaggerated by the
inclusion of Jaguar, the heavily loss-making luxury car operations.
Even without Jaguar, which was acquired in late 1989 and transferred to the
Ford US parent company in November 1991, the decline in Ford of Britain's
core operations has been precipitous.
Excluding Jaguar left 1991's loss at Pounds 487m and profits of Pounds 61m
in 1990. In 1989 profits had been Pounds 483m after a record profit of
Pounds 603m in 1988.
The operating loss last year, including financial services, totalled Pounds
201m, after restructuring costs of Pounds 68m relating to the automotive
side, against Pounds 313m, excluding Jaguar. Financial services operating
profit was Pounds 36m, compared with Pounds 24m.
The harsh grinding of gears at Ford has contrasted sharply with the
resurgent fortunes in Britain of its arch US rival, General Motors.
Vauxhall, GM's UK subsidiary, more than doubled operating profits last year
from Pounds 128m to a record Pounds 269m, while pre-tax profits rose by 69
per cent to Pounds 224m (Pounds 133m). It achieved record production at its
two assembly plants with rising exports and a record share of the UK new car
market.
The Vauxhall workforce has remained almost unchanged at about 11,000 in the
last five years, while vehicle output has jumped from 206,000 in 1988 to
302,000 last year.
By contrast Ford, the UK operations of which are far more extensive than
GM's, has been caught up in a turmoil of recession and restructuring. It has
been apparently unable, until recent months, to cope with the magnitude of
the whirlwind which has engulfed it.
UK demand for new cars has fallen sharply during the recession. Ford's
performance has been further undermined by a continuing erosion of its share
of this contracting market.
While the overall UK new car market has fallen by 31 per cent since 1989,
Ford's share has fallen from 26.5 per cent to 22.2 per cent. Its share
peaked at 30.9 per cent in 1981.
Ford new car registrations have fallen by 42 per cent since 1989, from
608,617 to 353,339 last year, with an 8.4 per cent decline last year in a
market that was almost unchanged at 1.59m.
More importantly, it has suffered a collapse in its net margins during the
recession under the impact of very heavy marketing costs in the form of
discounts and other financial incentives to try to support its sagging
sales.
Marketing costs, which jumped to a horrendous 24 per cent of revenues in
1991 from 14 per cent in 1990, were still above 20 per cent in 1992.
'If we had been able to sell vehicles at regular prices as we have done
historically we would have been in much better shape. These are the lowest
net margins we have experienced in history,' said Mr Bill Brooks, finance
director.
Exchange rate losses of Pounds 100m added severely to the company's problems
last year, said Mr Brooks, with the growing weakness of sterling in 1992
adding to the already high costs of imported vehicles and components from
continental Europe. Ford of Britain's trade balance has been in deficit
since 1981.
Last year's losses were compounded by assembly plants being forced to work
at only 62 per cent of capacity.
In response to lower-than-expected sales and in order to reduce excessive
stocks the company was forced repeatedly last year to resort to short-time
working. It cut a total of 214 shifts at its three assembly plants at
Dagenham (Fiesta), Halewood (Escort/Orion) and Southampton (Transit vans).
The Southampton plant stood idle for about nine weeks, with the loss of 89
shifts, while the Dagenham plant in Essex was forced to halt assembly for 5
1/2 weeks (56 shifts) and the Halewood plant on Merseyside being idle for
seven weeks (69 shifts).
Car production fell by 11 per cent to 302,784 (339,182), while commercial
vehicle output rose by 28 per cent to 144,291, leaving total vehicle
production static at 447,075 (451,996).
Ford finally took drastic action to reduce its manned capacity in November
last year as part of a dramatic restructuring of the whole of the
loss-making Ford of Europe operations.
The workforce of the core Ford of Britain activities, excluding Jaguar and
the former Ford New Holland tractor operations which were both disposed of
in 1991, was cut last year by 5,000 to 35,300 at the end of 1992. It has
fallen further in the early months of this year.
Expenditure on research and development in the UK was virtually unchanged
last year at Pounds 239m (Pounds 236m). But its capital expenditure has
fallen sharply from a peak of Pounds 669m in 1990, when it was investing for
the new generation Escort/Orion at Halewood, to Pounds 386m in 1991 and
Pounds 241m in 1992.
However, there were still some bright spots in the gloom last year.
Since last September's devaluation of sterling total unit production costs
have been lower at Ford's UK plants than in Germany, said Mr Brooks,
although production of the Fiesta small car was still cheaper in Spain.
According to Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, significant
improvements in productivity were achieved in 1992 led by a 23 per cent
productivity gain at Dagenham.
The improvement has narrowed the previously yawning performance gap between
Dagenham and Cologne, Germany in the assembly of the Fiesta. In 1988 Ford
required almost twice the number of hours to build a Fiesta in Dagenham
compared with Cologne. The gap was closed to only 27 per cent more in 1992,
said Mr Brooks, and had narrowed further this year.
The improvements at the UK plants had stemmed from 'changed working
practices, a focus on core activities, the extension of integrated
manufacturing teams, and the implementation of progressive agreements with
trade unions,' said Mr McAllister.
Ford has finally taken drastic actions to staunch its losses in the UK, but
with its rivals, including the newly-arrived Japanese producers, still
eating into its market share, it faces an uphill struggle to regain the
record profits of the 1980s.
CORRECTION
Ford of Britain's UK vehicle assembly plants worked at 77 per cent of
capacity in 1992, not at 62 per cent as the company incorrectly stated on
Thursday.

<TEXT>
A JAPANESE company affiliated with Japan Air Lines, and Grumman of the US,
are considering joint development of linear motor cars in the US, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
HSST, which is a company established to develop magnetic levitation linear
motor cars, and Grumman, the US defence manufacturer, are working towards
agreement on joining forces to develop the next generation public
transportation vehicles.
The two sides are still discussing what form co-operation between the
Japanese and US companies might take but a joint venture is one possibility.
One plan that is being discussed is to build a line between New York's JFK
and La Guardia airports.
HSST and Grumman have already been in discussion with the New York and New
Jersey Port Authorities on a plan to build a linear motor car line that
would eventually run into New York city itself.
Linear motor cars are an advanced public transportation system which can run
at speeds of 100 to 200 kilometres per hour. Japan has been working on
developing linear motor car technology for several years.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Israel sells 16.5% of shares in Bank Hapoalim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Jerusalem Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government yesterday sold off 16.5 per cent of its shares in
Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank, raising an immediate Shk360m
(Dollars 132m), our Jerusalem correspondent writes.
The sale, which was 120 times over subscribed, is expected to yield a total
of Shk783m once various share options are realised over the coming year.
Yesterday's sale marked the first time that shares in Hapoalim have been
traded on the Israeli stock exchange for almost a decade. Shares in the big
Israeli banks collapsed in October 1983 after years in which they inflated
their own share prices, leaving the Israeli government with little option
but to bail out the sector by taking a controlling interest in the banks.
Until yesterday, the government owned 97 per cent of Hapoalim and the
sell-off represents only the first small step on the government's long road
to divesting itself of all the shares in the major banks it stepped in to
buy 10 years ago.
Yesterday's sale was originally scheduled for three months ago, but was
delayed following a report by the State Comptroller's Office which
recommended that the government first approved proposals for a radical
reform of the banking system.
Last month, the government agreed a series of proposals designed to limit
the power of the major banks. Among the reforms are measures limiting the
banks' holdings in non banking subsidiaries, requiring major banks to sell
off smaller subsidiaries, and providing for separate managements to run
provident and mutual funds owned by the banks.
Further sales of government shares in Bank Hapoalim, which has total assets
estimated at Shk4.75bn, are anticipated in the not-too-distant future.
The next bank shares sale, however, is likely to involve Bank Leumi,
Israel's second largest bank.
Treasury officials say that the government is expected to sell off a 20 per
cent holding in Leumi within the next few months.
Israel yesterday said it freed 250 Palestinian detainees in a Moslem holiday
gesture but Arabs of the occupied Gaza Strip said the army simultaneously
tightened a ban on entry to Israel, Reuter reports from Gaza.
'Of the 250 detainees released today, 171 of them were residents of the West
Bank and the rest residents of the Gaza Strip,' an army spokeswoman said.
She said other detainees would be released on Friday.
Officials have announced Israel would release a total of 280 Palestinians
ahead of next week's Eid al-Adha feast. They said the step applied only to
minors, the ill, women and the elderly, and those about to complete
sentences for victimless offences.
Relatives gathered at a Gaza Strip checkpoint to greet detainees released
from a prison in southern Israel. Some of the detainees said they were due
to be freed in a few days anyway.
As some prisoners tasted freedom other Palestinians who had managed to go on
working in Israel despite a two-month ban on entry found themselves barred
again.
Palestinians said over the past three days soldiers had been confiscating
entry permits in Gaza without explanation.
By yesterday about 1,000 permits had been taken.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Fed intervenes as yen strengthens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve intervened twice on foreign exchange markets
yesterday, buying the dollar, after the currency continued to come under
strong selling pressure against the Japanese yen.
However, the intervention failed to stop the dollar falling to a new low
close against the yen in London of Y107.80, from a previous Y108.60. The
Fed's intervention followed similar action by the Bank of Japan in
Thursday's Asian trading.
For the second day running, Mr Lawrence Summers, the US treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, was quoted as saying that the US
was not trying to manipulate the yen-dollar rate.
According to Mr Mark Austin, economist at Midland Global Markets in London,
the yen could rise further against the dollar because of perceptions that
Japanese life insurance companies are still long of the US currency.
However, Mr Mark Brett, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,
believes the yen buying is an over-reaction by dealers. 'The market does not
understand that the US is also interested in reducing the Japanese trade
surplus by bringing down trade barriers and stimulating demand in the
Japanese economy,' he said.

FT  28 MAY 93 / US aid pledge cuts could threaten IDA funding: Arrears to
international development agencies would triple to Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENTIRE SDR13bn (Dollars 18.5bn) replenishment of the International
Development Association, the arm of the World Bank which provides
low-interest loans to the poorest developing countries, could be thrown into
doubt by the US Congress's efforts to accommodate new help for Russia inside
a shrinking aid budget.
The US had pledged a total contribution of Dollars 3.75bn spread over three
years, but this year will only allot Dollars 1bn, 20 per cent less than
promised.
Because the IDA's money is provided under a burden-sharing agreement
negotiated last year, any other country could now decide to reduce its
promised commitment by 20 per cent, a tempting option at a time of budget
crisis in many developed countries.
The IDA decision and other elements of the new US aid bill are expected to
triple the US arrears to international development organisations to around
Dollars 1bn.
The US aid bill produced by Congressman David Obey, who chairs the House of
Representatives subcommittee in charge of foreign aid spending, provides a
total of Dollars 12.9bn, Dollars 1.4bn less than President Bill Clinton had
asked for, and will now move to the Senate for further discussion.
To fit new aid for Russia inside this envelope, Mr Obey has proposed a
reduction of 2 per cent in every category of aid spending except for
refugees and the Peace Corps, and much deeper cuts in some categories.
But the administration insisted on no cuts in aid to Egypt and Israel, which
together account for 40 per cent of the US aid budget, even though Israel's
per capita income ranks between Ireland and New Zealand, so African and
other developing countries will be particularly squeezed within each
category.
But some aid organisers acknowledged that the blow could have been worse,
noting that Mr Obey had done his best to preserve funding for refugees,
disaster assistance and sustainable development.
Funding for debt relief will be slashed. The US, which has been the only
leading creditor not to grant full relief on loans to the poorest countries
of sub-Saharan Africa, had originally allotted Dollars 45m to debt relief
this year, but this will be scaled back to only Dollars 7m.
Mr Obey's efforts to squeeze out an aid bill have been complicated by the
Clinton administration's promises of more help to Russia and the other
republics of the former Soviet Union.
President Bill Clinton promised Dollars 1.6bn to President Boris Yeltsin at
their summit meeting in Vancouver in April, added another slice in the
formal budget he proposed a week later, and then promised a further Dollars
1.8bn at a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations in Tokyo earlier this month.
But the administration never came up with details of where this money would
come from nor, except in the most general of terms, what it would be used
for.
In the end, Mr Obey has clawed back Dollars 1.6bn originally allotted to
foreign aid and defence in the current fiscal year, and found another
Dollars 200m of savings in next year's budget to accommodate the Russian aid
package.
Foreign aid has rarely been popular in the US Congress, and is coming under
intense scrutiny at a time when so many domestic programmes are being cut
back.
'We don't have that many votes to spare when it comes to passing this
turkey,' Mr Obey said.

FT  28 MAY 93 / EC urged to meet on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders should meet urgently to discuss concrete steps,
including military action, to implement the peace plan for Bosnia agreed in
Washington at the weekend, according to Mr Hans van den Broek, EC
commissioner for external political relations.
Speaking on an official visit to Ankara, Mr Van den Broek, the former Dutch
foreign minister who chaired the EC council of ministers during the early
part of the Yugoslav crisis, said the Washington joint action programme
'raises questions which deserve clear answers.'
An aide to the commissioner said 'if the 12 are not prepared to provide
means to enforce the safe havens and the blockade (of Serbia's border with
Bosnia), they should say so. Then you have to look at other ideas, including
the possibility of lifting the arms embargo' for the Moslem-led Bosnian
government.
The US was rebuffed by its European allies when Washington argued in favour
of arming the Bosnian Moslems earlier this month.
Mr Van den Broek said 'military options could not be excluded' in
implementing the Washington plan, agreed between the US, Russia, UK, France
and Spain.
He said the EC had to make clear that Serbian 'aggression does not pay', and
'what our reply will be if military operations are extended to Kosovo.'
Mr Van den Broek has become increasingly frustrated at the drift of EC
policy towards the former Yugoslavia, even though his influence is limited,
and will still be so after the common foreign and security policy laid down
in the Maastricht treaty comes into effect.

government about the economic impact of its decision earlier this month to
resume commercial whaling.
Moves by several companies in Germany, a key market for Norway, to stop
buying Norwegian products and a call by the environmental group Greenpeace
for a European consumer boycott because of the whaling decision have alarmed
the business community, which fears long-term damage to the country's
exports.
Most political groupings at the European parliament yesterday declared
support for a resolution demanding Norway discontinue commercial whaling if
it becomes a member of the European Community.
Norway started membership negotiations in April.
The minke whale is included in the EC's list of endangered species, under
the so-called habitat directive which will be implemented from July 1994.
This month Norway's foreign minister, Mr Johan Joergan Holst, called on the
EC to remove the minke whale from the endangered species list.
In Brussels, Mr Eivind Berg, who is leading membership negotiations on
Norway's behalf, said he did not believe the European parliament's
resolution would interfere with the negotiation process. He suggested the
European parliament's resolution creates a potential difficult situation
once negotiations are concluded, however.
Senior officials in Oslo acknowledge privately that the threat from boycotts
by individual foreign companies and consumers was real.
Representatives of the Confederation of Business and Industry, the Norwegian
Trade Council, the association of fish producers, the ship owners'
association and the Norwegian Tourist Board held a two-hour meeting with
senior Foreign Ministry officials to outline their worries. 'I am much more
worried than I was a few days ago,' said Mr Kjell-Martin Frederiksen, head
of the Trade Council. 'The boycott is now taking place. Norwegian companies
are already being hurt.'
German companies which have said they will stop buying Norwegian goods
include three supermarket groups and Hawesta, a fish processing group. The
supermarket chains are Tengelman, Hertie and Nordsaade, a Unilever company.
Norway exported a total of NKr15.9bn (Dollars 2.30bn) non-oil products to
Germany in 1992.

ECE yesterday rejected a UN proposal aimed at settling a bitter 18-month
dispute with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia on its northern
border, Reuter reports from Athens.
'Greece cannot accept the proposal by the two mediators. . . of the Geneva
conference,' Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters.
He said that Greece wanted the UN mediation effort to continue and that he
would put forward new proposals. He also said Greece was ready to enter into
direct talks with Macedonia.
Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia has threatened to destabilise
the southern Balkans and peace envoys have tried to defuse the row, focused
on the name of the new state, which declared its independence from
Yugoslavia in late 1991.
Efforts to settle their differences in direct talks in early 1992 failed on
the first day because neither side would budge in the row over the name
Macedonia.
UN mediator Cyrus Vance and European Community envoy Lord Owen negotiated
between the two sides and put forward the compromise proposal earlier this
month.
The feuding Balkan states and the mediators have imposed a news blackout on
details of their talks and Mr Mitsotakis declined to say what was contained
in the offer.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Brittan calls for closer EC union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner for external economic affairs,
yesterday threw in his lot with the supporters of deeper European
integration and issued a stirring call for a single European currency.
In a speech likely to enrage British opponents of the Maastricht treaty,
including many in his own Conservative party, Sir Leon dismissed the idea
that the EC should develop into a loose, free-trade area extending into
eastern Europe.
'Widening must not mean less deepening,' he told an audience of the Konrad
Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, which included Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Sir Leon's speech offered a comprehensive view of the future development of
the EC, and reflects a growing confidence inside the European Commission
that Maastricht ratification is within reach.
Turning to the post-Maastricht agenda, Sir Leon called for streamlining and
modernising EC institutions such as the Commission and the European
Parliament, as well as tighter policing of the EC's external frontiers to
control illegal immigration, organised crime and drug trafficking.
But the striking aspect of the speech was its enthusiasm for European
monetary union and the 'undeniable' benefits of a single European currency
to cover exchange rate risks and the commitment to stable prices and fiscal
prudence.
'Neither the turbulence in the markets in recent months, nor the
recessionary conditions now prevalent in much of Europe in any way weaken
the essential long-term case for Emu,' he said.
Sir Leon left open the precise timing of Emu which could be by 1997 at the
earliest, or 1999 at the latest according to the Maastricht treaty.
He also hinted that stronger EC economies may proceed earlier than others;
but this did not matter as long as the objective of Emu was a shared one.
Chancellor Kohl also used the conference to restate his commitment to
European monetary union, in spite of the fact that only Luxembourg, of the
12 member states, currently fulfils all the economic preconditions.
He rejected any suggestion that the so-called convergence criteria should be
watered down, saying that they represented a necessary and healthy challenge
for all the EC members - including Germany - to bring their public finances
under control.

<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND agency responsible for the privatisation of eastern German
industry has recommended that managers of enterprises under its control
implement, wherever possible, the opt-out, or 'hard' clause.
Implementation of the clause, forged after a wave of strikes in eastern
Germany's steel, metal and electrical sectors, is an attempt by the Treuhand
to allow loss-making enterprises a chance to pull out of wage contracts
designed to equalise eastern and western wages by mid-1996.
Losses from 300 metal enterprises under the Treuhand already account for
two-thirds of turnover.
The recommendation is also aimed at containing the debts, and higher than
expected deficit, incurred by the agency since it was set up in 1990.
Treuhand officials have confirmed that by the end of next year, when the
agency is due to be dissolved, its total deficit could reach DM270bn
(Dollars 166bn), or DM25bn above target. Linde, the German industrial
conglomerate, is to build a DM100m (Dollars 61m) fork-lift truck factory in
China with an annual capacity of 15,000, shareholders were told this week,
writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
The plan was just one of a series of projects under preparation in the far
east, Mr Hans Meinhardt, chairman, told the annual meeting.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S plan to deport asylum-seekers to neighbouring countries, approved
in parliament on Wednesday, could be held up by Czech officials unwilling to
take them back.
Mr Josef Zileniec, the Czech foreign affairs minister said yesterday Germany
should understand it could not solve its domestic security issues at the
cost of the Czech republic.
Czech officials have indicated they will only agree to take back
asylum-seekers from Germany once proper border controls are set up with
Slovakia.
The bulk of asylum-seekers coming from the former Yugoslavia, Romania and
Bulgaria cross the former Czechoslovak territory.
'We first need assurances that countries such as Romania and Bulgaria will
take them back,' an official at the Czech foreign affairs ministry said. 'We
also need a proper border with Slovakia. This could take two years to be set
up,' he added.
German conservative MPs on Wednesday hailed a deportation agreement signed
three weeks ago with Poland. Under the agreement, Poland will take back
10,000 asylum-seekers this year and an unlimited amount thereafter. Germany
is offering DM120m (Pounds 47.8m) to build the infrastructure to host the
asylum-seekers.
The agreement with Poland was a crucial weapon in winning over the
opposition Social Democrats who opposed for a long time the constitutional
change.
The new law dilutes the automatic right of a person to seek asylum upon
entering Germany. Instead, guards will be able to turn back at the border
asylum-seekers 'with manifestedly unfounded' claims to 'safe' countries.
Officials at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Bonn have
warned that the German constitutional change will only partly curb the
influx of foreigners into Germany. A high number are expected to enter the
country illegally, now that filing an asylum demand no longer ensures they
can legally stay in the country for a period of time.
Plans to reinforce surveillance on Germany's eastern borders are under way,
with an additional 1,700 police men due to take up duty later this summer.
The interior ministry is also testing infra-red equipment which will allow
border trespassers to be seen at night.
According to the interior ministry, tougher security measures are also
planned for Frankfurt airport, where border guards will be able to send back
asylum-seekers coming from countries where no violations of human rights
have been reported.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Russians backtrack on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

   THE UN, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA last night back-tracked on its decision two weeks ago to veto a
British proposal to finance the UN force in Cyprus by mandatory assessment
of all states instead of voluntary funding.
A new resolution, which the Security Council approved by 14-0 with Pakistan
abstaining, combines elements of both forms of financing.
Greece and Cyprus have volunteered to contribute a total of Dollars 25m a
year for the force, leaving about Dollars 22m yearly to be shared among the
other 179 member states.
Because only a handful have paid to maintain the force, Britain has been
contributing, in cash and services, Dollars 50m a year. Under the new
arrangement this will drop to about Dollars 1m and Russia's share will be
about twice that amount.
The UN says the force, now down to 1,500 troops from a high of 6,400, is
about Dollars 200m in arrears.
Governments providing contingents have not been compensated for ten years,
although the UN was supposed to pay them 30 per cent of costs.
Russia's veto on May 11 was its first for nine years, and the first by any
member of the Security Council since February 19. The action, which
surprised many members, was interpreted as a demonstration of independence
after a long period when Moscow had gone along with the west.

<TEXT>
THE US cut off more than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.40m) in assistance to
Guatemala yesterday because of the suspension of democracy there, agencies
report.
The decision came as the military in Guatemala City sent armoured cars and
troops to break up a demonstration, which reflected mounting opposition to
President Jorge Serrano's seizure of near-dictatorial powers.
Despite a ban on demonstrations, an estimated 1,000 protesters gathered in
the city outside the Supreme Court where nine new members, hand-picked by Mr
Serrano, were to be sworn in.
The US State Department again appealed to Mr Serrano to reverse his actions
and suspended cash transfers to the Guatemalan government and military and
police training programmes. The aid cuts also apply to development
assistance and food aid channeled through the government. Aid channeled
through private groups, including humanitarian assistance, can continue.
Yesterday's announcement did not provide a figure on the value of the
suspended aid but officials said it was in excess of Dollars 30m. Dollars
45m in food aid and development assistance had been planned for Guatemala in
fiscal 1993. Also planned were Dollars 2.5m in anti-narcotics aid and
Dollars 400,000 for military training.
On Tuesday Mr Serrano dissolved the Congress and the judiciary and said he
planned to rule by decree until a new constitution was drafted. The US said
the suspension of the constitution put Guatemala 'on a dangerous course'.

dispute

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has taken further steps under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade to resolve the dispute over US countervailing duties on
carbon steel products from the UK, France and Germany.
Commission officials said yesterday the EC had asked the Gatt subsidies
committee to look into duties which Brussels argues has artificially
inflated the level of alleged EC subsidies.
However, on a separate issue, a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner
for external economic affairs, said yesterday, the EC would respond in kind
to the US sanctions in the government procurement dispute.
The duties cover lead and bismuth carbon steel products from Saarstahl of
Germany, Usinor Sacilor of France, and a joint venture to produce speciality
steel between British Steel and GKN, the UK engineering company. The duties
amount to around Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.3m) of business.
A Gatt panel decision is not expected until the autumn, but Commission
officials said they hoped the action under Gatt - rather than retaliation -
might have a positive influence in Washington.

GERMANY'S plan to curb the influx of asylum-seekers, approved in the

Germany should understand it could not solve its domestic security issues at

FT  28 MAY 93 / Pressure grows on peseta as election nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH peseta emerged bruised from foreign exchange markets yesterday,
just two weeks after an 8 per cent devaluation and 10 days ahead of the
hotly contested general election.
The peseta dipped briefly below its new central rate against the D-Mark, as
dealers took the view that the country's interest rates might be cut around
the time of the June 6 election.
The renewed market turbulence, following the third devaluation in under nine
months, has raised fears that the final week of the campaign could see the
currency come under serious attack.
After closing in London on Wednesday night at Pta77.88 against the D-Mark,
the peseta plunged to a low of Pta79.50, beyond its central rate of
Pta79.11. The currency later recovered partially to close in London at
Pta78.83.
Yesterday's decline in the peseta coincided with signs that the conservative
Partido Popular (PP), led by Mr Jose Maria Aznar, may be opening up a clear
lead over the governing Socialist party led by the prime minister, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez. Currency dealers have expressed fears that, if Mr Aznar is elected
as prime minister, he may ease monetary policy to stimulate the Spanish
economy.
PP officials yesterday issued a statement underlining their commitment to
the peseta's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. This helped
lift the peseta back above its central rate. The Socialists also deny
contemplating departure from the ERM as part of an effort to kick-start the
economy.
Spanish government officials yesterday accused dealers of undervaluing the
currency, but analysts continued to believe that, for a new government to
pull the economy out of its current recession quickly, rates will have to
fall quickly.
The Bank of Spain cut its benchmark intervention rate from 13 per cent to
11.5 per cent after the devaluation on May 13 and then by a further quarter
point last week, to 11.25 per cent.
But some economists were suggesting that rates might have to fall as low as
8 per cent to begin to have an effect on the economy.
Opinion polls do not show the effect on public opinion of a televised debate
last Monday night between Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar. However, the general
perception is that Mr Aznar did very well in the debate.
The next few days may see a big swing towards the PP, perhaps allowing it to
form a minority government on its own and relieving it of political pressure
to implement a hasty recovery programme.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (23): Why Japan is looking east - A
new trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S MOST ambitious contractor and developer, Kumagai Gumi, is selling
off European buildings as fast as buyers can be found, and the country's
aggressive brokers are trimming their London staff. The portents are clear:
the era of rapid Japanese expansion in Europe is over.
Like the stock market surge in the late 1980s and the country's domestic
capital spending boom, the Japanese expansion into international locales was
propelled by low-cost capital and high-powered ambitions which distorted
companies' expectations for return on their investment.
The slump in stock prices, the slowing of the domestic economy and the
general need for a restructuring of bloated financial and manufacturing
companies have encouraged the Japanese to concentrate on their profitability
at home and to be selective about extending their operations abroad.
There is one exception, east Asia, which promises growth rates which Europe
and the US cannot match. The Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan
says that banks are reducing their overseas assets and branches, and
reviewing their management structure. However, there is expansion in China
and other fast-growing economies.
Bank of Tokyo last month received approval from the Vietnamese government to
open a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City. It will be the first of
its kind to be opened by a Japanese bank, but certainly not the last.
Japanese companies have targeted the country as a medium-term, low-cost site
for component supply to manufacturing industry.
In contrast, the Industrial Bank of Japan has cancelled plans to establish a
broking subsidiary in the US, in spite of having made a formal application
in March 1991. IBJ, which is expanding into the domestic securities business
this year, found the US government's requirements for banks entering a new
business unduly cumbersome.
The contraction by financial institutions has been particularly noticeable
among second-tier brokers and local banks, which developed ambitions beyond
their means in the late 1980s. Okasan Securities has shut its Frankfurt
office, Sanyo Securities has closed a Los Angeles operation and Dai-Ichi
Securities has left Milan.
Even the larger Japanese brokers are reviewing their exposure in Europe.
Nomura Securities, the largest broker, cut its London staff by 35 late last
year, and has closed three European offices. Nikko Securities has closed
four overseas branches in the past year and may streamline further.
But Nikko says that London remains an important financial centre. Similar
sentiments are expressed by other Japanese institutions in spite of the
recent Bishopsgate bombing.
Though the offices of Tokai Bank were badly damaged by the blast, it still
says that a presence in London is necessary. It has reviewed its security
arrangements, as has Mitsubishi Bank, which says that terrorism in London is
one reason to send fewer Japanese expatriate staff.
Earnings are a more important influence than terrorism. Japanese companies
have reported three successive years of falling profits and can no longer
afford the prestige-inspired expansion characteristic of the late 1980s.
With capital costs higher at home and a fourth year of falling profits
looming, the emphasis of new investment is on maximising returns. Asia
appears to provide the most fertile ground. The Ministry of International
Trade and Industry found the average return on Japanese investment projects
in Asia is 3 per cent, compared to 1 per cent in Europe and -0.1 per cent in
the US.
The differences are even more stark for the return on manufacturing
investment, which is reckoned to be 5 per cent in Asia, 3 per cent in
Europe, and -0.9 per cent in the US. Over the last two years, Asia's share
of new investment has risen from 12.4 to 14.3 per cent, while the UK share
fell from 12 to 8.6 per cent.
The Japan External Trade Organisation believes that, in 10 years' time, it
will be 'impossible' for manufacturers to produce their components at home,
as the cost will be too high compared to that of other countries in the
region with an increasing pool of skilled workers.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (25): China is new priority - The
German approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING an extravagant foreign investment drive in the late 1980s, powered
mainly by the approach of the European single market, German industry has
re-focused its approach to relocation .
Between 1986 and 1991, almost DM130bn of productive capital flowed out of
the country compared with DM60bn in the first half of the decade. By 1991,
two-thirds of the DM29bn total was still being invested within the
boundaries of the European Community.
The EC with its 320m-strong consumer market is still the favoured target for
most German companies. All 11 partner countries offer the attraction of
lower wage rates. Britain's relatively modest corporate taxation and better
employee relations provide extra pull. Absenteeism rates in manufacturing
are 50 per cent lower than in western Germany.
But investment decisions are increasingly being conditioned by a potent mix
of old and new factors and constraints - some of which were either ignored
or neglected in the past.
The most obvious new elements are the opportunities opened up by the
collapse of European communism. German industry, with traditional strengths
in transportation, production equipment, telecommunications, environmental
engineering and other infrastructural sectors, is well- equipped to benefit.
Experience in the economic and infrastructural wasteland of the former GDR
will further enhance Germany's qualifications.
However, movement eastwards has been slowed by the inability of the
potential new customers to pay, the urgent need to invest elsewhere, and,
not least, by the crushing recession which cut west German economic output
by about 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year and sliced into
companies' profits and their ability to invest.
According to the corporate consensus, current priorities for German foreign
investment include China and the neglected US, which attracted only 11 per
cent of spending in 1991. According to one senior executive, the size of the
fast-growing Chinese market is only one of the factors at work: 'We simply
cannot sit back and let the Japanese take over another market unchallenged.'
Volkswagen, battered in its mainstream European markets by recession and
self-confessed mismanagement, provides an indication of the scale of German
ambitions. China will provide it with its third-biggest market after Germany
and Italy by 1996, the company claims. Its first Chinese factory, one of the
few group projects not to suffer from a current investment clamp, last year
increased output 86 per cent to just 65,000 cars.
Daimler-Benz is discussing building a Mercedes bus factory in Shanghai and
at the same time its AEG subsidiary is in talks on a joint venture to build
rail rolling stock nearby.
Investment in the US and Mexico reflects in part a determination to avoid
any risk of losing more ground within the North American Free Trade Area.
Volkswagen has less than 1 per cent of the US car market. But VW's Mexico
has already won more than a 30 per cent share of the local automobile
market. BMW's first non-German factory now under construction in North
Carolina and a recent decision by Mercedes-Benz to open its first US car
works, are belated recognitions that closeness to markets and competitive
pricing count for more than a Made in Germany label.
While the pull-effect of open global markets is drawing German investors
from their homeland fortress, they are being forced out by pressures within
 -the highest hourly labour costs in the world (DM42 last year compared with
DM30 in Japan, DM27.75 in neighbouring France and DM23 in Britain), the
highest environmental charges and corporate taxes, and the shortest working
times.
That explains why foreign investors find Germany one of the least attractive
sites for relocation. According to the IMF, Germany drew just 2 per cent or
Dollars 19bn of the Dollars 1,000bn of total global foreign direct
investments in the 10 years to 1991. The US, attracting almost 40 per cent,
was the most popular choice, followed by the UK with Dollars 153bn.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (24): It has to be the UK - The
special relationship still exists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN US companies seek locations in Europe in which to set up, expand, or
acquire business operations, the UK has significant advantages.
A common language and culture, a shared history and strong political ties,
are obviously important. But the UK also sells itself as a place where it is
easy to conduct business - there is less bureaucratic interference from
government than in many European countries, business regulation is generally
light, and labour laws are among the most liberal in the region.
Moreover, corporate tax rates are also lower in the UK than elsewhere in
Europe, wage costs are competitive, and the workforce is relatively well
educated and skilled. Equally important, the political environment is
stable.
As Geoffrey Robinshaw, whose role as a representative of the trade and
investment office in the British Consulate-General in New York is to
persuade US companies to locate in the UK, puts it: 'I'm inclined to think
that we're in the frame unless we mess it up.' Aidan Walsh, international
director at consultancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick in New York, agrees. 'It's
almost automatic that US companies will consider the UK first as a possible
location.'
While many companies consider the UK first, other European countries do not
stand aside. Competition for US investment is intense.
There was a rush of interest in Europe as a business location in the run-up
to the creation of the single market in 1992, and enthusiasm among US
companies has intensified in the past year or so. The integration of
European markets has led to a new emphasis on consolidation - of
manufacturing, servicing, retailing and marketing operations. US companies
that once had production or servicing facilities in several European
countries realise that the free movement of goods, people, services and
capital means they may now need only one central location for their
European-based business.
Mr Jean Claude Goldenstein, New York-based director of European location
advisory services for Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'There is a growing tendency for
US companies to disregard the nation-state concept, and instead think
Europe-wide for their markets, and regionally for their facilities. The
trend is to centralise production, back offices, and customer support
facilities in selected regional locations.'
European governments recognise how high the stakes are in this game, which
is why they offer US and other foreign companies packages of business
incentives, which include financial grants and special tax breaks.
In this respect, the UK believes it compares well with the rest of Europe.
Mr Robinshaw says: 'The UK government does not believe in throwing money at
projects. But in terms of grants, what can be available is always subject to
negotiation. . . and comparable to anything offered elsewhere.'
The UK is at a disadvantage, however, compared with Ireland, which has
lowered corporate tax rate to 10 per cent for foreign companies with
manufacturing operations or financial services units in the country.
Ireland also competes closely in terms of labour costs. Apart from Spain and
Greece, it is the only major European economy where these are lower than in
the UK.
Yet cost is not the only key consideration in assessing locally-employed
labour. Education, skill levels and industrial relations are also important.
Here, US companies find the UK has both strengths and weaknesses.
The French and German state education systems at secondary level generally
have a better reputation than Britain's. But in higher education, the UK
fares better. US companies seeking well-educated and experienced science,
engineering and computing graduates find plenty in the UK.
As for industrial relations, the UK has a lead over its European
competitors, thanks primarily to the liberalisation of labour laws during
the 1980s. This, says a recent Ernst &amp; Young report, has created a
'competitive advantage for the UK, Ireland and Switzerland, which do not
have large severance payments or trade union requirements. A number of
highly-publicised recent plant locations to Scotland highlight this trend.'
By comparison, French and German labour laws frighten many US managers. Mr
Walsh, of KPMG, says, for example, that the EC's planned 'social charter',
which the UK government is resisting, worries US companies, which do not
want to be forced to put workers on their board of directors, or to accept
restrictions on firing and hiring.
Inter-governmental European politics can also affect the way in which
different countries are perceived, although it is difficult to say whether
the UK's reluctance to commit itself fully to European economic and
political integration deters some US companies from locating in the UK.
At least one relocation consultant does not believe US companies are too
concerned by the UK debate about its future in Europe. As he delicately puts
it: 'Americans are not internationalists. They have no real focus on what
goes on outside their country.'
Others disagree, arguing that the political battle being fought in the UK
over the Maastricht agreement is monitored within the US. Mr Goldenstein
says US companies worry that 'the centre of gravity in Europe is shifting
south and east'.
Even Mr Robinshaw, at the British trade and investment office in New York,
accepts that a prolonged internal fight over UK's role in Europe could hurt
the country's business prospects. 'The longer these things drag on, the more
they will permeate people's consciousness.'
A by-product of the UK's problems in Europe, the withdrawal of sterling from
the exchange rate mechanism, is unlikely to have deterred US companies from
locating in the UK. It could prove a double-edged sword - the sharp
devaluation of the pound makes it easier to export UK-made goods, but also
reduces the value of US companies' repatriated profits.
Companies keen on setting up a central European distribution operation might
find other locations more convenient than the UK. Yet, as Mr Walsh of KPMG
puts it: 'All a company wants to know is: how far am I from my market?'
However, companies measure distance not in miles but in hours. Goods
manufactured in the UK can be delivered to most European markets in 24
hours. The completion of the Channel Tunnel should improve transport links -
even if, as one consultant says, 'most Americans don't realise yet that you
won't be able to drive through the tunnel.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (21): Good year for big landlords -
The Commission for New Towns and English Estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WALKER and Tony Pender have had a pretty good year. One sold 500 acres
of development land and the other let more than 2m square feet - not a bad
record during a recession. In fact, you might expect them to be carried
through the streets on shareholders' shoulders.
Their feet remain firmly on the ground, however. In the first place they
want to do far better before contemplating celebrations. It might also be a
little difficult for more than 50m backers to gather in appreciation.
As two of the country's largest landlords, they play a key role in the
property industry, yet you would search in vain for a share listing. They
represent the rump of a once-huge public sector drive to help businesses
find better locations, competing in the private sector but still owned by
the taxpayer.
Mr Walker is chief executive of the Commission for New Towns, controlling a
portfolio worth Pounds 1.7bn, including 18,000 acres of land and more than
9.5m sq ft of buildings. At least that was the score at the end of the last
financial year. By now it could be less, as he is managing to tap a
continuing demand for space around the 21 new towns he handles.
'You can't compare the figures with previous periods because we have taken
on Milton Keynes and Telford in the last two years and these make up a
quarter of our land bank,' he says. But there is one telling comparison with
the competition. 'Five hundred acres is equivalent to one of those proposed
private new towns. And they were planned to take 15 years, whereas we are
selling that much each year.'
Things could be a lot better. More than 1,000 overseas companies surged into
the new towns before the worldwide slump took hold, so a return to some kind
of normality could see twice as much land being absorbed. For the moment,
however, he has to feed off smaller fry.
'A lot of medium-sized component companies are looking to set up on the back
of the big Japanese manufacturers which have already found their niche. The
only problem is they take a long time to plan these moves.' he says.
Slack has also been taken up by more local moves, as companies take the
opportunity to gear up for the recovery. Not all these are stimulated by
rock-bottom prices. While industrial land values more than halved in the
south, some parts of the north have seen prices climbing even in the
recession, says Mr Walker. It should all make taxpayer 'shareholders' smile,
with almost Pounds 180m going back into the Treasury from asset sales in the
last financial year.
Tony Pender is knee-deep in local moves. That is not surprising, considering
that one of his main tasks as chief executive of English Estates is to
provide premises small companies cannot get from the private sector. It
means a higher rate of premature lease terminations through business
failures than a listed company could accept, but that is all part of the
remit of this state-owned group, which is due to be absorbed soon into the
new Urban Regeneration Agency.
Things got a little out of hand last year when he had to take back 2.5m sq
ft, more than wiping out the 2.1m sq ft let. But the fact that the figures
reversed in 1992-93 is a sign that recovery is under way.
'It is still a flat market but there are signs of revival because of
sterling devaluation and the economy pulling around,' he says. Overseas
companies have been knocking on his door, too, particularly for premises in
the north-east. Already in place are names such as Mitsumi and Hashimoto in
Tyne and Wear, while others are keen to get space to meet deadlines for UK
production quotas.
This is partly why English Estates is considering boosting its speculative
building program after cutting back over the last couple of years to
concentrate on land sales. Nothing is put up nowadays without rigorous
research into likely demand, and this shows good prospects for units in the
30,000 to 50,000 sq ft range in areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, and
the north.
Other busy areas include buying and servicing sites for sale to local
developers on behalf of the Rural Development Commission in an effort to
encourage relocation into more efficient buildings to mop up pockets of
unemployment in the countryside. A special project is also under way to
offset the rundown of VSEL in Barrow and British Nuclear Fuels in
Whitehaven.
But the biggest relocation project must be the comprehensive redevelopment
of Chatham Dockyard, where Colonial Mutual Assurance has been provided with
a new headquarters and Countryside Properties is confident enough to join in
with a 92,000 sq ft speculative office scheme.
As fast as it builds, English Estates is also selling. Under government
orders to liquidate the whole 22m sq ft portfolio it sold 757 units in
1991/92, putting almost 80m into Treasury coffers on top of the rent roll of
around half this amount.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (22): Glimmer of light from the
business parks - Profile of Arlington Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THINGS have not gone smoothly for Arlington Securities over the past couple
of years. The barrage of bad publicity over difficulties faced by its
holding company, British Aerospace, often turned a harsh light on the
developer. There was speculation that it was bound to have suffered from the
property slump and was a prime target for disposal.
There is a grain of truth in such doubts. With town-centre rents tumbling,
there was no way the company could have maintained the runaway success of
the 1980s, when it pioneered out-of-town parks for big office users.
But Barry Holmes has the perfect answer for critics. For the first time the
business parks division's figures have been separated out from other
operations, showing a Pounds 12.8m profit for the year to last December,
says the marketing director. The group is also continuing to expand: 'We now
have 12 operating parks and another seven in planning stages,' he adds -
definitely not a picture of an operation wilting under pressure.
It takes a bit more imagination nowadays to set up big relocators, such as
the Pounds 96m sale-and-leaseback of almost 300,000 sq ft to Dana
Corporation at Farnborough last year through a leveraged lease organised by
Salomon Brothers for sale in the US. Having a big parent like BAe to back
such deals is crucial, and another could soon be on the cards.
But there is still a turnover of more modest schemes which helped shift a
total of almost 400,000 sq ft in 1992. The rents are not what they were, of
course, but Mr Holmes insists that he has never done a deal with more than
six months of free occupation - unlike some city-centre lettings where
income has been postponed for years by landlords desperate to get space
filled.
It helps when existing tenants do your selling for you. When Arlington set
up a 'great debate' on relocation in Bristol last year, NatWest Insurance
Services was happy to lecture on the advantages of moving out of the city
centre to 50,000 sq ft of offices on Aztec West Business Park. Hoare-Lee,
the engineering consultants who have been on the park for three years, went
further than praise for the extra parking and better environment, prod-
ucing hard figures to prove the benefits of relocation.
'At first they were worried about being separated from clients, but found
that customers were delighted to come out and see them,' says Mr Holmes.
After logging staff time, this proved a 5 per cent gain in productivity.
As the recovery takes effect he expects more companies to look at relocation
again. Business tends to be more concentrated among buildings in the 10,000
to 20,000 sq ft range nowadays but low interest rates make owner- occupation
attractive, so site sales are likely to improve. Meanwhile, Arlington is
continuing to put up a few speculative buildings on each park to ensure the
widest range of choice.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (19): Search for growth industries -
Profile of Hertfordshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Hugh West's first acts after taking over as managing director of the
Hertfordshire Development Organisation - a body set up last year to promote
inward investment - was to visit the headquarters in the US of several of
the big multinationals with existing UK bases in the county.
His purpose was to try to ensure that when UK investment decisions are made
by these companies in future, the process which has often taken place in the
past - a move from the south-east of England to more distant parts of the
UK, such as Wales and Scotland - is not repeated.
Hertfordshire, and its neighbouring counties in the prosperous
doughnut-shaped region around London, have become used to being the pool in
which other regions of the UK have fished for inward investment
opportunities - and to the consequent loss of jobs.
In the past, while their economies were being constantly replenished by new
investment, it was possible to accept this migration with a degree of
equanimity. The latest recession, however, has differed from its
predecessors, for the first time hitting the south-east harder than the rest
of the country.
In Hertfordshire, the inflow of jobs from London and the rest of the
south-east has not stopped, but it has slowed down. Meanwhile, one of the
main props of the local economy - defence and aerospace - has seen very
large cuts. Unemployment in the county has increased faster than anywhere
else in the UK, with the figure rising from 2.1 per cent in 1989 to near the
national average of around 10 per cent, bringing the total out of work to
more than 40,000. Included in this figure, are many of the county's com-
muters who have lost their jobs as a result of cuts in the financial
services sector in the City of London.
The HDO, set up with financial support from the county and district
authorities, the training and enterprise council (Tec), and local companies,
is the county's response to the change in its fortunes. Its aim, apart from
ensuring existing companies stay on and expand in the county, and not
elsewhere, is to attract growth industries. It has targeted five sectors -
computers, telecom- munications, office equipment, pharmaceuticals, and
financial and business services.
With many other regions going for similar targets, and often able to offer
extensive grants and other inducements, there will be a concentration within
these sectors on niche markets which can take advantage of existing
expertise within the labour force, for example that gained in the aerospace
industry in using very difficult and complex materials, or in high precision
engineering. The county will also be seeking to avoid parts of the world
where other better-funded regions make their regular calls.
In the health field, where the county is already strongly represented,
medical engineering is seen as an area where the skills available from
sophisticated defence and electronics manufacturing can be utilised. More
important, there are hopes that the 'biotech boulevard' which has developed
along the A1 through the county will continue to expand.
Hertfordshire already claims to be the biggest centre for pharmaceutical
research and development in Europe. Four of the world's biggest drugs
groups, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, Roche of Switzerland, and
Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme of the US carry out research in the county, along with a
number of smaller companies. Glaxo, which already has plants at Ware and
Stevenage, is building a Pounds 500m research centre in Stevenage which will
eventually employ 1,500 people.
In financial and business services, further growth in back office operations
 -perhaps hastened by worries over security against terrorists, and the need
in consequence to split operations between different centres - is also
expected, and is thought likely to be encouraged by the availability within
the county of large numbers of potential clerical and managerial recruits.
Over the past two years back office or headquarters functions have been
opened by Perrier and Trebor Bassett at Rickmansworth, by Rhone Poulenc at
Watford, and by the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society at Potters
Bar, and the insurance company, Provident Mutual, is bringing together its
headquarters functions at a Pounds 40m new site in Stevenage which will
employ 850 people.
A possible new area of growth could be in credit and debit card processing
where there are believed to be several US banks interested in bringing new
customer services to Europe.
The county's inability, unlike other competing parts of the UK, to offer
grants and incentives, is not seen as a significant drawback. Grants are
given to compensate for other problems, such as location or the lack of
trained labour, Mr West argues. 'We already have in place most of the
conditions that incoming companies would wish to find, including excellent
road, rail, and air communications, proximity to London, and other main
markets, and a wide range of information technology, engineering, managerial
and professional skills.'
Many companies, too, and in particular smaller ones, are reluctant, he
claims, to become involved in negotiations for grants because of the time
taken and the costs involved. Grants are more likely, he believes, to be of
interest to companies considering very large projects, which Hertfordshire
is unlikely to win, even though it has a number of substantial sites to
offer as a result of the closure of aerospace, defence and other engineering
activities.
These include the 57-acre site Cherry Tree Lane near the M1 in Hemel
Hempstead, which is being marketed by the Commission for New Towns, the
60-acre Rolls-Royce Leavesden site and British Aerospace's 200-acre Hatfield
site.
The availability of such sites has, according to Brian Briscoe,
Hertfordshire's chief executive, made it possible for the county to be more
wel- coming towards developers than was possible during the mid-late 1980s
when there was virtually full employment, and a lack of sites outside the
Green Belt.
'In 1988 it was proper to say all industrial land was fully utilised. We now
have the opportunity to encourage development to occur. The focus is on
bringing land back into use,' he argues.
The speed with which new manufacturing and services investment is attracted
to Hertfordshire will depend to a large extent on the strength of other
leading European economies, some of which are now moving noticeably into
recession.
Some analysts, too, forecast that it will be some time before those who have
fallen out of work in Hertfordshire find jobs which offer the same pay and
conditions as they used to enjoy, particularly if, as seems likely, many of
the newcomers are smaller companies.
With the locational advantages the county enjoys, however, the HDO sees
itself as probably not a long-term player in the inward invest- ment
marketplace, which is probably good news for Britain's more peripheral
regions.
'If the economy does turn, in two or three years' time there may not be the
need for a development organisation in the form we are at the moment. The
better we perform the quicker we close down,' says Mr West.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (20): Time to sing the praises -
Case Study: Texaco at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVING from the stylish environs of Knightsbridge to the brave new world of
Canary Wharf was a big upheaval for the 1,000 employees of Texaco, the
US-owned energy group. It was also something of a gamble for their
employers.
The latest, big arrival at Canary Wharf - the move was completed in March -
has taken up residence at 1 Westferry Circus, from where it now operates its
group headquarters.
Texaco's move from offices close to Harrods was forced upon it by an
expiring lease and a landlord who wanted to redevelop, but the choice of
where to go next was its own.
By 1987, it was clear to the company's executives that the business would
have to move from several addresses in the area - held on highly beneficial,
historic terms and conditions which it knew could not be repeated.
The commercial property market was powering ahead, with West End rents
escalating and landlords holding all of the cards. An analysis showed that,
while some core personnel had to remain in the centre of London, the others
did not. The decision was taken to look beyond the M25 motorway and, in all
probability to the west of London.
But the arrival of Mr Peter Bijur as chairman of the UK operations brought a
change in strategy. Mr Bijur, who has since moved on within Texaco, was keen
that Texaco operations should be integrated. He wanted a single site.
A variety of options were considered but Canary Wharf, which had been
considered at an earlier stage of the relocation exercise, emerged at the
top of the list. The quality of office space was regarded as without equal
and, despite some concerns over transport links, the comparative price of
accommodation made a powerful argument for moving east.
By mid-1989, Texaco had signed a commitment to lease floorspace not then
completed and undertook an extensive operation, with the help of the London
Docklands Development Corporation, to assist staff in calculating the impact
on them of the change in address and in devising new routes to work.
In early 1990, employees were taken down to docklands to see the development
for themselves and to hear LDDC officials sing the praises of what was still
largely a building site. There were obviously reservations but there was,
also, some surprise at the quality of the working environment being built.
Mr Roger Colombe, a Texaco managing director in charge of administration,
says that transport links were the most obvious source of concern to staff
but that detailed discussions took place to assess the problems and secure
suitable travel arrangements. The company also negotiated a series of deals
intended to ease the cost and complexity of the journey to work. 'The
problem of getting to work is far less than many people originally believed.
It will get even better now that some important links in the transport chain
are being completed,' says Mr Colombe.
Around a third of Texaco employees now drive to work, about 130 use the
river bus service and the remainder use the docklands light railway, with
its much-improved services.
Despite the upheaval, Texaco says that the number of staff leaving as a
result of the decision to move has been small. It reckons that, last year,
fewer than half a dozen people departed because of the move, although it
accepts that at a time of high unemployment, some people remain who might
otherwise have been tempted to find more convenient employment.
Texaco has not disclosed how much it is paying for its accommodation at
Canary Wharf but says it is happy that the rent is highly competitive,
relative to the market and to the sort of accommodation costs being paid by
its competitors.
In short, Texaco does not believe that it has, in any sense, placed itself
at a commercial disadvantage. The move itself went smoothly and the business
has not been disrupted.
The company recognises that staff may not be entirely satisfied with the
range of facilities on hand nearby to the office worker - 'more shops]' is a
constant cry from people used to the rich, retailing facilities along the
Brompton Road and Knightsbridge.
But Texaco believes that the area will ultimately fulfil the vision of the
developers and says that its move will have proved to be the right one.
According to Jane Bentley, a Texaco secretary: 'The surroundings are
delightful and the views are wonderful. We could do with more a 'community
feel' around us, but that will come in time. Overall, I think most people
are quite happy with the move.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (17): Crewe lays on the red carpet -
Profile of Sokkia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFORD Borough Council came within a pittance of winning the relocation of
Sokkia, the Japanese surveying instrument company, from south-east England
last year.
A perfect site to build a new factory had been found near Sale, only 10
minutes from Manchester airport, but the Japanese turned it down because of
the council's attitude.
'They wrote a rather blunt letter saying they could offer us nothing,' Mr
Stephen Blaikie, Sokkia's UK managing director says. 'It made a tremendously
poor impression on my Japanese superiors. Even a small discretionary grant
of Pounds 5,000 towards some of our costs would have swung it, but my
colleagues' view was that if they didn't want us, we didn't want them.'
Sokkia went to Crewe Business Park in the Cheshire countryside instead.
Crewe and Nantwich Council - like Trafford - has no regional selective
assistance to offer, but it made the most of what it could give.
This included a cash grant to help with landscaping outside the new factory
and small sums to assist local recruitment and training. Nine people were
hired locally, including a financial controller.
There was also 'key worker accommodation' available in council housing or an
equivalent subsidy for private rental. Three of the seven Sokkia staff
transferring from Crawley in West Sussex took advantage of this while
selling their homes in the south-east.
Above all, however, was the warmth of the welcome. Sokkia executives toured
sites all over north-west England on a two-day package tour organised by
Inward, the region's government-backed inward investment agency.
When they visited Crewe they got the friendliest reception and were
entertained to lunch by the mayor and council chief executive. The mayor
later opened the company's new building, to which Sokkia moved in the first
week of April 1992.
'Coupled with the willingness to help in any way they could, all this showed
a commitment to us by the local authority. My Japanese colleagues put great
store on commitment. If people commit themselves to us, we will commit
ourselves to them,' Mr Blaikie adds.
Sokkia decided to move out of Crawley when its rent came up for review,
threatening to rise from Pounds 9.50 a sq ft to around Pounds 17.
It started looking for land to buy and build upon, but was deterred by
south-eastern prices of Pounds 700,000 an acre and poor sites - the only
nearly-suitable one was an infill between existing buildings on an
insalubrious industrial estate.
The company had also come to question being south of London anyway. Its big
customers - construction companies in particular - are in the Midlands and
north. Getting to Crawley involved stressful journeys around the M25 which
were often an ordeal for the people Sokkia was selling to or training.
Mr Blaikie investigated the south coast, Oxford, the Medway Towns,
Basingstoke, Portsmouth and the M4 corridor. The company already had offices
in Sunderland and at Salford Quays, but was bursting out of the latter. He
soon decided the north-west offered the best prospects.
Once Sokkia's senior Japanese executives in Europe and Japan had approved
the move, the company bought 1.1 acres of land in Crewe Business Park at
Pounds 200,000 an acre, with an option on another half an acre. Its
purpose-built premises have 12,000 sq ft of modern space and have been
designed to allow a 50 per cent expansion on the existing site.
Offices, workshops, stores, demonstration rooms and training facilities have
views over green fields. The business park itself is being developed with
ecological considerations foremost. New roads are being planted with avenues
of trees. Staff walk nature trails at lunchtimes.
The location has also provided a very practicable means of calibrating
surveying instruments when they come in for service. They work by bouncing
an infra-red beam off a distant prism, allowing distance to be calculated to
within a fraction of a millimetre.
The Crewe location has given Sokkia several important line-of-sight
baselines for calibration, ranging from 10 metres to more than 1.2km.
Instruments being calibrated are mounted on a computer-controlled test bed
within the building. Infra-red beams are then aimed by the instruments at a
series of reflecting prisms known distances away.
The two nearest are on Sokkia's own walls, but there is one on another
building in the park at about 250 metres distance and others on the halls of
residence and main teaching block of Crewe and Alsager College, between 400
and 600 metres away.
The farthest is on British Rail's multi-storey block in Crewe, more than
three-quarters of a mile away. Invisible - and harmless - infra-red beams
shoot across the open spaces round the clock as instruments are calibrated.
In Crawley, there would have been no chance of doing this on such a scale,
with a few hundred metres the best distance achievable.
The difference between Sale and Crewe, however, matters little in terms of
servicing the customer base. The business park is six miles from the M6 and
therefore easily accessible by road. Crewe's famous tradition as a railway
junction, of course, speaks for itself.
Since instruments and spares are relatively small items, much trade comes
and goes through Manchester airport, only 30 minutes away. 'We are very near
the centre of Britain in terms of travelling time,' Mr Blaikie says. The
company, which now employs 32, has been able to close down all other UK
branches except in Sunderland, vacating both Salford Quays and Crawley.
Staff formerly based in Salford now travel to Crewe to work.
There has also been a financial bonus. Despite selling mainly to a
construction and civil engineering sector that has been damaged badly by
recession, Sokkia has managed to keep its turnover within 3 per cent of last
year's.
This means it has increased its share of a falling market. Mr Blaikie says
Sokkia now has about Pounds 4m-worth of a current Pounds 15m UK market. Its
main competitor is Leica, the Swiss-owned optical company. Mr Blaikie
expects to do very well out of economic recovery.
He says easier access to customers - and customers' easier access to Sokkia
 -is critical to improving performance. The days when customers battled
round the M25 and arrived exhausted in Crawley have gone.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (18): An affluent image problem -
Profile of East Kent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's forthcoming announcement on assisted area status, with all
it entails in additional grants from the European Community, is awaited
particularly eagerly by business and local authority leaders in the less
prosperous parts of Kent.
Areas in the north and east of the county have an image problem. They are
within 70 miles or so of London and are widely regarded as being part of the
traditionally affluent south-east. Yet, east Kent, while beautiful and
well-heeled in parts, has many of the problems of the industrial north with
rundown basic industries, and a dearth of new employers choosing the area
for relocation.
Mr Tim Byles, director of economic development at Kent County Council, sums
up the general frustration at the way in which the area is stubbornly seen
by outsiders as part of the Garden of England - a perception has proved hard
to shift. 'East Kent is as badly off as any area in England, Scotland or
Wales, but because it is south of the Thames, the assumption remains it must
be wealthy.'
There is also an assumption that, because of its proximity to the continent
and the rest of the EC, all will be well when the European economic scene
improves. This is not necessarily the view of local authority leaders and
businessmen.
Mr Martin Hemingway, general manager of the East Kent Initiative, a pressure
group formed from local authority and private sector interests to
co-ordinate plans, believes that although the area has an attractive quality
of life, 'it will be doomed without substantial inward investment to create
new jobs . . . something must be done to save the region.'
Hence the application last year for assisted area status for six travel to
work areas in north and east Kent, four of which are in the Top 20 list of
deprivation in the UK. For example, only six of the 99 currently assisted
areas in the UK have a higher unemployment rate than Thanet's 16.5 per cent,
and unemployment on the Isle of Sheppey is over 18 per cent.
Assisted area status would encourage government and other public and private
agencies to point foreign companies in the direction of east Kent, and
provide grants to help build industrial estates and boost small companies.
In addition to long-term unemployment caused by the contraction or demise of
traditional industries such as engineering, bricks, papermaking and coal
mining, the area faces structural change from the introduction last January
of the single European market, and the proposed opening next year of the
channel tunnel. The single market is estimated to have taken around Pounds
30m a year out of the local Dover economy, an average of Pounds 1,000 per
head of population.
A recent study on the impact of the tunnel forecast a net gain in jobs for
Kent, but argued that these were likely to occur mainly outside east Kent,
and later than the big job losses expected over the next few years.
Economic handicaps are spread across east Kent, and not just the area most
affected by the tunnel. North of a corridor of prosperity centred on
Canterbury and Ashford, lies the district of Swale which includes Sheppey
and Sittingbourne.
To the north-east is Thanet with endemic unemployment in the faded glories
of Margate, Broadstairs, Herne Bay and Whitstable. Local unemployment is
exacerbated by the seaside syndrome. A shortage of tourists has led to some
hoteliers and boarding house owners taking in the homeless on social
security benefits. This puts strains on local authorities and does little
for the image of the resorts.
It would be wrong to paint too black a picture, though. The area is well
place strategically for Europe, there is ample development land, and there
is a skilled labour force available.
Mr Ken Welsh, responsible for economic development at Dover district council
and the East Kent Initiative, says: 'We have a plentiful supply of
relatively cheap land and we are the closest English-speaking area to the
heart of the single market . . . the potential is there but it has got to be
opened up.'
What has held development back in the past, and dissuaded many companies
from relocating to east Kent, has been the poor infrastructure. Work on key
roads is now well advanced, particularly the M20 from London to Folkestone,
and the Thanet Way to Margate and Ramsgate, and plans are in hand to upgrade
the vital link from the M2 to the swing bridge across to the rather isolated
Isle of Sheppey.
Sheppey is probably the worst blackspot, and the Swale district council was
disappointed last year when the Pounds 500m Lionhope development for the
island, including a new road and tunnel, was turned down by the government
on environmental grounds.
An amended plan is currently being drafted with the help of the environment
department, and private funding is being sought from local landowners to
expedite the design and planning stages.
Mr Bill Croydon, chief executive of Swale, believes the area's greatest
asset is the deep water port of Sheerness, the fifth largest freight port in
the country. To take advantage of its facilities and easy access to Europe,
it must, however, become more accessible.
The recently confirmed plans by government, local authorities and private
interests to develop the east Thames corridor should boost the image and
employment prospects of the area, particularly Gravesend and the Medway
towns, but only in the longer term.
Greater significance is placed on the decision to go ahead with the
long-delayed high speed rail link between the Channel tunnel and London,
with a main inter-national passenger station planned for Ashford, and others
to be placed strate-gically to improve the lot of the badly-served north
Kent commuters.
When the link is in place the journey time from Ashford to London will be
halved to 40 minutes. Connecting trains will put Ramsgate and and Dover
within an hour of London - a key factor for inward investment and general
prosperity.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (16): A credit gain for bay scheme -
Profile of NCM/Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO TAKE great pleasure watching great holes being gouged out of the
ground have been well-satisfied in Cardiff, especially the city's docklands,
these past couple of years. New roads, new buildings, moved buildings,
restored buildings have sprouted up all over the place. No sooner is one
building completed than another takes its place.
As the Welsh Health Common Services Authority's new home facing Cardiff
Bay's inner harbour approaches completion, the hard-hat men have begun
another hole. This one will, within the next 20 months, become the
headquarters of NCM Credit Insurances, part of the Dutch concern, NCM, that
claims to be the largest private credit insurer in the world.
By this autumn bricks and mortar will begin to appear. It is a prestige
site, owned by Grosvenor Waterside. By the turn of the century an opera
house and centre for the performing arts, a base for the Welsh National
Opera Company, is expected to be built next door.
NCM will be in situ long before then. Its building should be completed by
the end of next year and the first staff should be settling in soon after.
For NCM the move to Cardiff Bay is its second relocation. NCM Credit
Insurance may be Dutch-owned now, but until 16 months ago it was the
short-term end of Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK government
organisation responsible for providing companies with insurance cover
against losses on overseas sales.
As a government department ECGD was a prime candidate, for a move, following
the Hardman review during the 1970s of government office location. Its small
computer department had already been transferred to Cardiff, and as many of
ECGD's activities in the short-term market were scattered around the City of
London it was considered sensible for the department to have a new home.
The choice was eventually narrowed to three centres, Liverpool, Glasgow and
Cardiff. Having decided on Cardiff space was found within the Welsh Office
which had just extended its offices in the heart of the city. It was that
choice that was to lead to the second relocation.
Cardiff's civic centre is governed by a covenant from the Marquis of Bute's
estate which restricts occupiers to non-profit-making bodies. The Welsh
Office sits alongside the university college, city hall, county hall, Temple
of Peace, law courts and national museum. Not a penny of profit among them.
The decision at the end of 1991 to privatise the Cardiff part of ECGD meant
it could no longer live cheek-by-jowl with the Welsh Office. 'From the
moment privatisation came on the agenda in 1988 we knew another home would
be necessary,' says Mr Colin Foxall, once under-secretary in ECGD
responsible for the short-term business and now managing director of NCM
Credit Insurance.
'Right from the start, we always intended, if at all possible, to maintain a
commitment to Cardiff. That does not mean we did not look elsewhere, and, of
course, we did. We would certainly have moved out of the city if we could
not have found the right place.'
Even within Cardiff NCM looked at several sites before settling on Grosvenor
Waterside's prestige development in the Bay. One building in the heart of
the shopping area, near the station, came under close scrutiny and others on
the outskirts were reviewed.
In the end, NCM decided not to go elsewhere, and to relocate to the bay area
because it wanted to be part of the redevelopment of Cardiff's docklands.
This is the largest urban regeneration in Britain outside London's
docklands; perhaps the largest in Europe. The company found the prospect
exciting, according to Mr Foxall.
There were also hard commercial reasons. 'Since arriving in Cardiff in 1980
we have built a very fine staff, now numbering about 450,' Mr Foxall says.
'If we had moved well away from Cardiff then we should have undermined that
great asset. Cardiff has a well-educated labour market, it is fairly young
and there is a pool of the right sorts of skills which we could tap.'
Over the years first as a government department, and now as a company, NCM
has recruited, trained and developed its staff from the local labour market.
'We tend to recruit at a young age,' Mr Foxall says, 'with the result that
many of the people who came to us soon after our arrival in Cardiff are now
in fairly senior managerial positions. 'This is a very specialist industry
and as staff turnover is low we don't lose too many people, an important
consideration to us.'
As the company's business has become increasingly sophisticated and geared
to the latest information technology, staff numbers have not risen, so that
around 400 people will eventually move out of the Welsh Office when the new
headquarters is ready for occupation. Nine regional offices, as well as the
computer centre elsewhere in Cardiff, also report to Mr. Foxall. This
compares with about 700 when ECGD originally arrived in Cardiff almost 13
years ago.
It is not numbers so much as quality that Mr Foxall stresses, though. Mr
Foxall himself is a Londoner, who made the move to Wales after a lifetime in
the department and secondments to the Department of Trade and Industry, and
the European Commission in Brussels, so he views the area through the eyes
of an incomer.
'There is a very good quality of life here,' he says. 'It's not just about
theatres and museums but also about shopping and entertainment and
restaurants. Commercially, it has very fast and good links with London'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (14): Facing up to an about turn -
Efforts to attract the civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE middle of January, General Sir David Ramsbotham, adjutant-general of
the army, was guest at a lunch given in his honour by the city of Glasgow.
The aim was to celebrate the decision by the army to locate its new
personnel centre handling army pay and pensions in the city, creating 700
jobs.
The idea involved closing several smaller offices around Britain. In
addition to the new jobs, some 400 existing ministry of defence jobs in the
city would be safeguarded. The MoD would do everyone a favour by occupying
Tay House, a large new office building standing empty in the heart of the
city.
But the celebrations proved premature. In early March, Mr Archie Hamilton,
the armed forces minister, said the army was now considering an alternative
building at Stockport, near Manchester. Its consultants had overlooked it
originally but the MoD had to face the fact it was on the market for Pounds
4m against the Pounds 20m the Glasgow site would cost.
The apparent about turn by the MoD infuriated Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, and dismayed and puzzled the Glasgow Development Agency which had
persuaded the army that Glasgow was the army's best choice. Mr Hamilton said
it had always been stated that the original decision was 'subject to review
and further consultation'. He indicated that Stockport was likely to win the
re-opened contest.
The GDA still believes it has a good chance of saving the project for
Glasgow, believing that the costs of refurbishing the Stockport building and
the other advantages of Glasgow mean that its case outweighs that of
Stockport. No final decision has been made.
But the affair has been a poor demonstration of the government's stated
policy of showing greater consideration to Scotland. The policy was summed
up in a white paper issued in March entitled Scotland in the Union: a
partnership for good.
It said that since 1979 more than 4,000 civil service jobs 'are recorded as
having been moved or being about to move to Scotland'.
The day the white paper came out the government announced that the
department of trade and industry would move part of its oil and gas division
from London to Aberdeen. This was a partial victory for leaders of the
Aberdeen oil services industry who have been arguing for several years that
the government should move the Petroleum Engineering Directorate (PED) (once
part of the former department of energy) to Aberdeen.
The PED handles drilling and production licence applications by oil
companies. Scottish Enterprise, in a detailed study in 1991, endorsed the
theory that by moving the whole PED to Aberdeen enormous benefits would
follow. Oil companies, it said, would transfer the staff who dealt with the
PED to the northern city, and engineering design companies would follow
them.
The split in oil industry expertise between London and Aberdeen would end.
Aberdeen would become the unchallenged centre of European oil expertise.
Exports of services and equipment would increase and the UK share of the
world offshore oil market might double. Eventually, an extra 15,000 jobs
might be created in the UK.
Many people said at the time that Scottish Enterprise was spoiling a good
case with exaggeration. The Scottish media did not help, repeatedly saying
that the 15,000 new jobs would all be in Scotland or even in Aberdeen alone,
rather than in the whole of Britain.
There was evidently intense reluctance by the oil industry civil servants to
move north. After much prevarication the government commissioned a study of
the issue by Ernst &amp; Young.
The Ernst &amp; Young report, released last month, will have made uncomfortable
reading for Scottish Enterprise. It said there was 'no clear case' for
moving the whole of the PED to Aberdeen. It would mean a loss of business
efficiency to the DTI. The impact on the location of other organisations
would be 'small'.
It acknowledged that there would be a 'small gain' in promoting an
agglomeration of industries and skills in Aberdeen, which 'should improve
the UK international position in offshore supplies and services'.
The government has decided to move 60 geologists and engineers of the PED
from London to Aberdeen to provide services previously only available in
London. The Aberdeen office would take 'the nationwide lead in the issue of
field development consents' and process development applications from
companies based in Aberdeen. If more oil companies moved the office would be
expanded to 80 staff.
It was a partial victory for Aberdeen but also an overdue dose of realism.
The civil servants start moving towards the end of this year.

fears - Profile of Northern Ireland

RESIGNED FOR years to being regarded as just a coloured pin on the map of
world trouble spots found in most TV newsrooms, economic planners in
Northern Ireland are encouraged that the province is finally attracting
attention for more benign reasons.
The Industrial Development Board, the government body charged with the task
of promoting inward investment to the province, says that in 1992 it had one
of its most successful years since it was established 10 years ago. It is
estimated that some 1,900 new jobs will result from projects signed up in
the past year, five times the number in 1991.
Most notable among the new project announcements are Seagate Technology from
California, which is establishing its first plant outside the US at
Londonderry, with a Dollars 65m investment to manufacture wafers for
computer hard disc drives, and Texmaco, an Indonesian textile firm, which is
to invest Pounds 95m in two plants to manufacture new high-tech polyester
fibres and fabrics for the European market. Together they will provide some
1,400 jobs when operating at full capacity.
Mr Frank Hewitt, the deputy executive director of the IDB, expressed
characteristic Belfast caution in assessing the significance of the upturn.
'Several of the projects have been under discussion for a while, and are a
result of investment decisions which were probably delayed because of the
recession. We will not necessarily have as good a year this year,' he said.
Nonetheless, he said, 'Seagate was a tough and hard-fought project, and we
are pleased to have won it against the competition'.
Attracting companies to invest in Northern Ireland is a particularly
difficult task. 'Not only do we have a perceived peripherality problem with
the sea crossing, which regions, such as Wales and Scotland do not have, but
we also have the security situation and the negative image created by it'
said Mr Hewitt.
His approach is 'to be totally honest about it all and put it into context.
We cannot attract companies here under false pretences as we want to build a
long-term relationship with them. That requires both sides being honest with
each other'.
The peripherality issue was not a big problem for Mr Marimutu Sinivasan, the
president of Texmaco. He said: 'Although we will be supplying the European
market, we have found that transporting our product from Northern Ireland is
absolutely no barrier to having our operation here, a fact borne out by the
other Northern Ireland companies we have talked to who are also selling into
Europe'.
The frequency and reliability of ferry sailings to Stranraer from Belfast
and Larne, and the lack of traffic congestion in the province are factors
cited by many freight forwarders from the Republic preferring to ship out of
the north rather than Dublin 100 miles further south.
AVX, a leading manu- facturer of ceramic capacitors used in computers and
telecommunications, set up its European distribution centre at Larne in
1991, which the company says was chosen because of the province's advanced
telecommunications network.
This allows orders from across Europe to be placed electronically and to be
delivered within 48 hours.
On the issue of political violence, Mr Hewitt points to the security
statistics which show Northern Ireland to have one of the lowest crime rates
in Europe 'even including the terrorist attacks'.
If overcoming these obstacles were not enough, however, the IDB itself has
recently drawn fire from behind its own lines. In a report published by the
Northern Ireland Accounting Office last February, the IDB was criticised for
allowing the level of government contributions to overall project costs to
creep up from 21 per cent in 1990/91 to 27 per cent currently. It said that
greater attention needed to be paid to the issue of job displacement from
elsewhere in the UK and in the IDB's 'value-added' assessment of IDB-funded
projects.
Mr Hewitt admits that he faces some conflicting objectives - namely to win
the inward investment for Northern Ireland, but in doing so to keep the cost
to the taxpayer at a minimum.
Do the criticisms mean that the IDB will be tougher in assessing projects in
the future?
Mr Hewitt insisted that the IDB already carries out a very rigorous
appraisal process but said that in allocating its Pounds 157m budget this
year, 'we are aware we must give value to the taxpayer as well as meet our
other objective which is to promote job creation'.
An important job creator over the past four years, has been the boom in
back-office services moving to Northern Ireland, attracted by lower wage and
property costs than in inner-city areas such as London, and top-class
telecommunications.
Although the driving force for this has lost momentum with the recession, Mr
Terence Killen, the IDB section head responsible for promoting such
back-office relocations, said: 'Firms should take a longer-term view.
Property and wage cost differentials are likely to widen again as the
economy recovers. Staff turnover is also much lower here and as investment
in people rather than machinery or plant is a feature of the services
support industry, this can be very important'.
One of the biggest such projects announced to date is that by the new Child
Support Agency which is to establish a new centre at Belfast, employing 750
people, and from which it will service all of the east of England.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (13): A useful lesson in happy
endings - Profile of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE job of Robert Crawford, head of Locate in Scotland, is to attract inward
investment. But for three months until the end of February this year most of
his time was spent trying to prevent some of it seeping out.
The problem that confronted him was the threat posed to Digital's plant in
Ayr, south-west Scotland, by the US parent company's need to retrench in the
face of losses. Digital had to decide whether to close its plant at Galway
in Ireland or shut down Ayr.
In the end Digital decided to maintain the Ayr plant, which was producing
its new Alpha personal computer, and shed 780 jobs at Galway, though a
further 350 employees there were retained. Some 980 jobs at Ayr were saved.
It was a happy ending after a very tense few weeks for Mr Crawford and
Locate in Scotland. For him it underlined several lessons in the present
state of the inward investment market.
First, countries which benefit strongly from inward investment by
multinationals have to face the threat posed by corporate rationalisation.
Even if companies are doing well, they may still need fewer plants in EC
countries because of economies due to standardisation of products in the
single European market and the easing of inter-country barriers. Even if
plants do not close they are often employing fewer people.
Second, it reminded him that 'you've got to retain what you've got and grow
what you've got. You could spend a lot of time chasing after new
investments, while existing investors are leaving your patch.'
The statistics for inward investment (investment from other countries) and
for relocation (movement from the rest of the UK) are now being totted up
for the year to the end of March 1993. Mr Crawford gives no sneak previews
but says: 'I have been very pleased. Things are going quite well.'
But he is not necessarily claiming that 1992/93 was a better year than
1991/92. The fact is that both inward investment and relocation into
Scotland have gone off the boil since the late 1980s. In 1989/90 Scotland
attracted 64 projects with a total of 12,300 jobs planned, involving
investment worth Pounds 853m. In 1991/92 some 59 projects were announced,
with 6,000 jobs planned and a total of Pounds 381m to be invested.
Japan, Mr Crawford points out, has been 'quiescent' as an inward investor
because of its recession, though the new town of Livingston recently won an
air-conditioning equipment factory by Mitsubishi Electric, which already has
three plants in Scotland.
A number of other medium-sized investments have been decided in the
electronics sector, mostly by US companies, while Escom, the fast growing
German personal computer maker, is a relatively rare European entrant.
The importance of existing companies was underlined a few days ago when
International Business Machines at Greenock confirmed it was giving Mimtec,
a Scottish assembler, a big contract to assemble its PCs. The deal will lead
to the building of a 300,000 square foot factory employing 300 people at
Gourock.
Mr Crawford says that Locate in Scotland needs to keep in touch with
existing investors to be able to anticipate their parent companies' next
moves and get Scotland on to the short list of locations before a project
has even been decided on.
Locate in Scotland is also looking for new industries to encourage, to move
away from heavy dependence on the electronics sector, which employs about
45,000 people. One idea is to build on the particular strengths of Scottish
universities in the field of opto-electronics. Although there are a number
of Scottish-based companies in the field, the industry is dominated by
Japan. If Japan were to internationalise its industry Scotland should be put
high on its list of possible locations.
The recession in the UK has slowed down the flow of relocations from the
south of England. In 1990/91 the number of jobs announced as being relocated
into Scotland from the rest of UK was 5,200; the following year it was
1,400. Yet there is still a trickle.
Elonex, the London-based personal computer company, is setting up an
assembly plant at Cumbernauld through its associate Cordata.
At the high value end of the market Cray Systems has opened a software
centre at South Queensferry near Edinburgh.
It will be noted that many of the towns mentioned in this article as
receiving new projects are new towns. Scotland still has its five new towns
 -East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Irvine - unlike
England where they have been wound up. But winding up is on its way in
Scotland.
The Scottish new towns have been crucial to the development of the high-tech
economy which Scotland has aimed at in the past two decades and receive
about half all Scottish inward investment. High-tech companies from the US
and Japan, accustomed to modern plants in modern locations, usually prefer
to go to new towns.
This is not necessarily because of the grants - Glenrothes, for example, is
not in an assisted area - but because of the assistance which new town
development corporations supply in providing readily available premises at
concessionary rents and giving a general helping hand.
But East Kilbride and Glenrothes are to be wound up at the end of 1995;
Cumbernauld in 1996, Livingston in 1998 and Irvine in 1999. What will happen
to them and the assistance they give incoming companies?
Much of their industrial property is to be sold to the private sector. The
Scottish Office initially floated the idea of the development corporation
staffs staging management buy-outs and forming 'local development
companies', purchasing many of the commercial assets of their towns. But
that ran into Treasury objections that the MBO teams would not offer the
best price available.
The Scottish Office then said, just before the general election, that MBO
teams might be allowed only the development land and part-finished estates,
a much less appetising prospect. It also wants at least some of the new town
corporations' operations to be taken over by the local enterprise companies
or LECs, which are part of the Scottish Enterprise network.
Mr Crawford says: 'The new towns were very good colleagues to Locate in
Scotland. The LECs will to some measure replace them.'
But although Mr David Millan, chief executive of Cumbernauld Development
Corporation, is reasonably positive about the proposed new arrangements and
says 'the intention is that we will see a seamless transition', other new
town officials are fearful that much of what they supply will not be
provided after wind-up. The LECs, they point out, would have less money
available and will have other priorities.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (11): Company care becomes the focus
 -Winning investment is only the first stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INWARD INVESTMENT in Britain will change in the 1990s, according to the
Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body for north east
England and Cumbria.
In the past decade, UK inward investment organisations have focused on
chasing greenfield projects, a competition in which north east England, with
high profile Japanese catches like car maker, Nissan, and microchip
manufacturer, Fujitsu, has been conspicuously successful.
The worldwide search for new projects continues. NDC maintains a strong
profile in the world's most promising inward investment target areas through
nine overseas offices, including two in the US and two in Japan, the biggest
investors into the region.
In the last six months alone, it has announced a clutch of new investments
and acquisitions by companies from Hong Kong, the US and Switzerland,
ranging from television manufacture and knitwear production to telephone
marketing services and the purchase of Sunderland University's
electro-magnetic compatibility testing facility.
But the agency now sees winning inward investment as only the first stage.
The new challenge is to evolve a support role, to ensure the investors it
has gained remain and prosper. 'We need to plan in the knowledge that
reinvestment, development of the existing investment base, will be far more
important in the 1990s,' says Mr John Bridge, NDC's chief executive.
'It may well be the plant here is in competition with the plant in, say,
France to get the ear of the parent in the US. A third party can be quite
helpful.'
The NDC is not alone in this view. At a recent Newcastle University seminar
Professor Neil Hood, director of the Strathclyde international business
unit, argued that British inward investment agencies need to develop an
aftercare and support role.
'Many so-called multinational companies are not remotely multinational,'
said Prof Hood, ex-director of the inward investment agency, Locate In
Scotland. 'The managers are largely left on their own to compete for
investment within the company. Local agencies can help them.'
Increasingly, he said, foreign investment in the UK was in the form of joint
ventures and acquisitions, yet inward investment projects, although small
and declining in number, were still being keenly pursued, partly because of
their glamour. Many agencies, he suggested, are ill-equipped for the more
subtle and resource-intensive role of supporting existing investments.
NDC, however, says it has already responded to this trend by allocating
staff to new areas of activity over the last two years, including supplier
linkages, support in securing further funding, and an aftercare programme
for inward investors. Some may, for example, need help with training. Others
may have tentative plans for expansion, which NDC can help them realise.
Around 40 per cent of new inward investment-related jobs in the region now
come from expansions and reinvestments, says Mr Chris Fraser, NDC's director
of operations.
In the 1960s and 1970s the region saw enclave investment, says Mr Bridge,
with overseas companies setting up self-contained plants. Now, he says, the
area must aim for embedded investment, so the inward investment is just the
starting point for a complex web of linkages.
Creating these linkages - the growth of a locally-based automotive supplier
base for Nissan's Sunderland plant is an example - will, it is hoped,
encourage spin-off investment and ensure plants remain.
The region now has investments by more than 350 overseas companies. More
than 120 are North American-owned, and 50 Japanese. It claims to be the
principal European centre for manufacturing investment from the Far East.
But while the US has resurged as a source of inward investment, interest
from Japan is very flat.
Although NDC is firmly established within the north east as the
co-ordinating body for inward investment - Cumbria keeps its options open by
also being a member of Inward, NDC's north west counterpart - County Durham
has its own development company (CDDC), set up to raise the profile of a
county which has to compete against neighbouring urban heavyweights Tyne and
Wear and Cleveland.
The CDDC, which sees itself as adding value to, rather than competing with,
NDC's efforts, is hoping the expected creation of an enterprise zone in East
Durham will help regenerate an area which has lost its last four pits,
employing 4,000 men, in the last three years.
John Elliott, CDDC business development executive, says that while the era
of big investment projects may be past, there is a myriad of small and
medium sized opportunities to aim for. He hopes Durham University's proposed
Pounds 30m science park will help attract quality investors.
In Northumberland, the county council has opted for some lateral thinking to
encourage investment, by targeting companies in which its superannuation
fund has equity stakes.
Between 1985 and the end of 1992, NDC estimates overseas investment in the
region created 24,405 new jobs, and safeguarded a further 11,800. The
estimated capital spend was almost Pounds 3bn.
The safeguarded category covers acquisitions of existing plants in the
region by overseas investors. One recent example is the purchase last month
by the Whiting Company of Vermont, of South Durham Fibres, based at Bishop
Auckland. The plant, which makes PVC and polyester filaments, will become
the European manufacturing base for Whiting, a synthetic fibres
manufacturer.
In 1991 and 1992, safeguarded jobs were proportionately more important than
in the 1980s, accounting last year for almost half the total 5,784 jobs
secured. The NDC is aiming to secure a total of around 5,000 jobs a year
through inward investment. The total UK annual figure is around 50,000.
It could be argued that inward investment's importance in the region's
economic base has been overestimated. An analysis by Northumbria University
academics Frank Peck and Ian Stone of 1980s' incoming greenfield
manufacturing investment in the region pointed out that it comprised just 5
per cent of the total stock of manufacturing jobs at 1989 levels. However,
they also noted the newcomers were creating the type of jobs - full-time and
for men - badly needed in the region.
The NDC's Agenda for the North, its strategy for long term economic growth,
published last December, stresses that inward investment has played an
important part in maintaining the region's manufacturing performance,
creating new sectors, such as semiconductor manufacture, and strengthening
growth sectors such as electrical and electronic engineering. It also
suggests inward investors have upgraded quality levels achieved by
suppliers, improving export performance.
On the downside, it notes an absence of some key research, design,
development and marketing functions among the northern operations of
overseas companies, but points out this is a general problem for the region,
as UK headquarters are overwhelmingly concentrated in London and the south
east. Advantaged though it is in this regard, southern England has,
nevertheless, been lobbying hard over the redrawing of the assisted areas
map.
The importance of UK government regional aid , which also helps unlock
European grants, is undisputed. Between 1987 and 1992, every one of the 82
new greenfield overseas investment projects in the northern region went to
assisted areas. Of 202 projects, including new arrivals, joint ventures,
acquisitions and expansion, 95 per cent were in assisted areas.
'If some parts of the south of England get it and we retain what we've got I
wouldn't be too worried,' says Mr Bridge. 'If they get it at the expense of
parts of the north, I would be more concerned.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (12): Investment initiative launched
 -Profile of Cumbria's coastal strip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGING by the glossy brochures which promote most parts of Britain, there
are certain factors - beautiful scenery, executive housing, good
communications - which tip the balance when companies consider relocating.
The brochures, however, are often more coy about another crucial
consideration - the availability of grant aid.
A certain embarrassment lingers about admitting the need for financial
incentives to attract inward investment.
But the fact the Department of Trade and Industry has received 2,000
representations lobbying for inclusion on its redrawn assisted areas map
shows the significance of such aid, which also attracts European funds.
Nowhere was the announcement of the new map more anxiously awaited than in
the Cumbrian Travel to Work Areas of Workington, Whitehaven and
Barrow-in-Furness.
Superficially, the unemployment statistics of Cumbria's coastal strip might
suggest it has fewer problems than many other parts of Britain; in February,
the unemployment rates for Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow TTWAs were
12.5, 9.8 and 9.4 per cent respectively, compared with a UK rate of 10.5 per
cent.
But behind the figures lie deep-seated structural problems; the Cumbrian
coastal strip, already tussling with difficulties of geographical
peripherality, poor road, rail and air links and traditionally low levels of
indigenous entrepreneurship, is in the middle of considerable job shedding
at its two dominant workplaces, the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing
site and VSEL's shipyards in Barrow-in-Furness. Consultants have predicted
unemployment will rise sharply. In Copeland's case, the latest forecast is
unemployment of more than 20 per cent by the end of 1994.
Although phased over a few years the job cuts - at least 6,000 from the
Sellafield site and more than 9,000 from VSEL - are especially traumatic
because of the lack since the 1970s of any substantial inward investment
into the area to diversify its industrial base.
'Nothing of any major significance moved in during the 1980s in the whole of
West Cumbria,' says Alan Williams, business manager of the West Cumbria
Development Fund.
British Nuclear Fuels, which is ploughing more than Pounds 1m annually into
the fund to encourage economic regeneration, is also building on its
presence as a big local purchaser and source of technological know-how by
developing the new Westlakes science and technology park near Whitehaven.
So far, 15 companies, employing 102 people, have been signed up, filling
Westlakes' first phase. Of these, seven are from outside the area. None is a
total relocation; their headquarters remain elsewhere. Phase II, now under
development, will be marketed to attract more businesses from outside West
Cumbria.
The Northern Development Company, responsible for encouraging inward
investment into north east England and Cumbria, believes indigenous growth
is crucial to long-term regeneration of the Cumbrian coastal strip's
economy. 'The real gains lie in local business development,' says NDC chief
executive Dr John Bridge.
In the shorter term, however, local economic development bodies believe
significant inward investment, either by companies relocating or expanding,
is vital to create more jobs.
In a spirit of self-help, the county's public and private sector and
job-creating agencies have created the Cumbria Marketing Initiative, a
Pounds 1m campaign to attract inward investment, launched in Barrow last
October by board of trade president Michael Heseltine.
Under the slogan 'Cumbria will work for you', it aims to raise awareness of
the county as a potential business location. Last month it reported it had
generated more than 100 inquiries from companies 'interested to learn more
about the benefits of relocating to Cumbria'. These inquiries are being
chased up and a harder-sell second phase campaign is planned for year two.
Self-help, though, cannot surmount every obstacle. Unintentionally
underlining the area's remoteness from Westminster, four ministers have
since October at short notice cancelled visits to Copeland. Among them was
Mr Heseltine, who had to cancel the latter part of his Cumbria Marketing
Initiative launch when bad weather grounded his helicopter, needed because
the road from Barrow to Whitehaven was far too slow.
'Self help can only be part of a total package; at the end of the day we
have to offer incentives,' says Bob Metcalfe, Copeland borough council's
director of development and services. 'There have to be sticks and carrots;
the carrot of Regional Selective Assistance is absolutely vital.'
At present, Workington TTWA has Development Area status, but Copeland and
Barrow are non-assisted, placing them at a severe disadvantage. Even within
West Cumbria, Workington's DA status has caused imbalance; 80 per cent of
business developments assisted by the West Cumbria Development Fund in
recent years have been in Allerdale, which includes Workington.
Sellafield's expansion cost Copeland its development area status in 1983;
ironically, it is the site's job-shedding which has made the borough's pleas
for assisted area status more insistent.
In support of the three TTWAS' bid for DA status, Cumbria county council
argues that nearly 50,000 people work in manufacturing and energy-related
industries within them, about 70 per cent of the county's employment in
these sectors. In the 1980s, their performance helped raise Cumbria's gross
domestic product from below to above the UK average.
Without new industrial development in Barrow and West Cumbria, says the
council, Cumbria GDP will fall back to early 1980 levels, when it was 10 per
cent below the UK average.
The area's problems, the argument runs, are structural, not cyclical. 'While
the south east will get better of its own accord, we're going to need an
injection of new business in this area to broaden the base,' says Furness
Enterprise chairman Mr Alan Forsyth.
The intensive national lobbying over the new map and the new aid for pit
closure areas - Cumbria's mines shut too soon to benefit - are viewed with
some gloom in the county.
'There is a distinct possibility the assisted map will be drawn on a
political basis rather than a needs basis,' says Mr Metcalfe. The investment
which assisted area status should attract is crucial, he says. 'If we don't
get that we are in terminal decline.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (9): Familiarity breeds success -
Profile of Black Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACK Country Development Corporation started work in 1987 with the aim of
creating 25,000 jobs over a lifespan of about 10 years. Bringing new
companies into one of the most derelict industrial areas of the UK was one
way of achieving that end. Helping the expansion of those already in the
area was another.
For the fledgling corporation, charged by the government to regenerate 10
square miles - a tangle of factories, homes, small shopping centres, narrow
roads, canals and rivers between Birmingham and Wolverhampton - the first
task was to establish awareness that the Black Country exists. London
Docklands and Leeds are readily identified. Not so the Black Country, said
Mr Ian Page, the external affairs director. 'Our initial technique in the
early days was to get the name of the Black Country across to people - where
it is and the role of BCDC as a facilitator,' he said. And that, as its
heavy advertising shows, it is still doing.
In the late 1980s, BCDC did not have extensive land or prepared sites to
offer incoming companies. Indeed, a strong element of its work has been the
assembly of land, frequently in fragmented ownership. While the economy was
growing, the effort was directed towards drawing property developers into
the area.
But as the momentum of BCDC's activities gathered force, the economy went
into decline, forcing a change in the emphasis of its approach to land
assembly and sales. 'With recession and the developers not being prepared to
do speculative development, we looked more towards end-users and occupiers,'
said Mr Page.
Five years into its life, BCDC has accumulated land, most notably at and
around the old Patent Shaft Steel Works site. Here it has been able to focus
its marketing pitch from the general to the specific by offering the site as
an automotive components manufacturing park. It is having talks with two
British subsidiaries of German and US manufacturers.
The planned components park points up the strength and the weakness of BCDC
in the relocation marketplace. First, the Black Country is playing to its
traditional economic role as a manufacturing area, rather than as an area
for glitzy offices. Second, its geographical position, close to the M5 and
M6, puts it within easy reach of the motor assembly plants of the Midlands.
Third, while its central location is an advantage, the internal transport
links have been poor; hence the importance which has been attached, since
BCDC's inception, to building a new road which will provide dual carriageway
access to the motorways from the Patent Shaft site. Only now is construction
beginning.
The translation of promise to execution for better internal transport links,
added to the hard-won possession of sites, means that BCDC is now able for
the first time to go to, for example, automotive component fairs in Detroit
and property investment exhibitions in Cannes with, as Mr Page put it,
'something to sell'.
Although, the gradual return of confidence which appears to be seeping into
the UK economy no doubt has something to do with it, the level of inquiries
for sites in the BCDC area is this year running one third up on last year.
Most of the inquiries from overseas companies come to BCDC through the West
Midlands Development Agency, a body which, with a mixture of locally
generated and central government funds, acts for the region as a whole in
seeking to attract inward investment. BCDC does not seek to duplicate the
role of the WMDA, but rather to co-operate with it.
To attract British companies, however, it is on its own and in competition
with nearby centres such as Birmingham, Coventry and Telford. If a company
wants a greenfield site, it will not be attracted to the Black Country. But,
like other development corporations, it has an array of powers to help
incoming and resident companies.
It is the planning authority. It administers, with the department of
environment, city grant. It can ease applications for regional selective
assistance. It can put companies in touch with local authorities to obtain
funds under the Inner Urban Areas Act.
These powers have been used recently to assist overseas companies such as
Bohler, the Austrian steel importing and processing group, Hofesa, the
Spanish curtain track and window blind company, Huf (UK), the subsidiary of
the German locks manufacturer, and Luigi Fontana, the Italian fasteners
company, all of which have recently arrived or have expanded
foot-in-the-water operations.
Similarly, British companies which have consolidated manufacturing
operations in the Black Country from other parts of the UK include Laporte,
the chemicals group, John Cotton (Colne), the car headliner manufacturer,
and Biwater Engineering Products, the water engineering group.
No figures are available which separate out jobs created by inward
investment, jobs created by companies relocating their operations or jobs
created by corporate expansion in the area. Nor indeed are there figures for
jobs lost by companies moving out of the area. But BCDC said that jobs on
new developments established since it came into existence totalled 9,898.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (10): Transfer to pastoral setting -
Profile of Fairey Hydraulics
</HEADLINE>

FAIREY HYDRAULICS, a division of the Fairey electronics and engineering
group, has exchanged the obscure charms of Heston, near London's Heathrow
airport, for a factory in Avon set beside a Georgian house with stone walls,
primroses, and sheep and cows grazing in the surrounding fields.
For a company making safety-critical controls systems for the aerospace and
defence industries, it might seem a pastoral setting, although its site, on
the edge of the village of Claverham, is within a few miles of
Weston-super-Mare and even closer to the M5 motorway.
Fairey Hydraulics completed its move just over a year ago as part of a group
relocation from the 10-acre Heston site, where Fairey had been for some 40
years. 'The site was far too big for the situation facing the Fairey
companies and we needed to move away,' says Simon Frost, managing director
of Fairey Hydraulics.
It was decided that the group headquarters would go to Egham in Surrey but
the main relocation was of the hydraulics division to Claverham, where its
research and development had been situated for 10 years. 'That was a
hangover from the days when it was fashionable to have your R&amp;D somewhere in
the country away from the rest of the company,' says Mr Frost. 'We did
consider other areas but we felt relocating our key engineering personnel
who were already at Claverham was unacceptable.'
At the same time, it was decided to restructure the division. At Heston,
there were about 400 staff; at Claverham today, there are 300. 'We were very
fortunate that our strategy to consolidate in the west country and make the
company a little smaller was slightly in advance of the reduction in the
aerospace and defence industry,' says Mr Frost.
In late 1989, a small pilot scheme was set up to test the local
manufacturing skills in advance of the final decision. 'We were very
satisfied. it really gave us confidence,' says Mr Frost, an engineer who
joined Fairey that year from General Electric Company.
The decision to go to Claverham and seek planning permission for a new
factory was announced to the staff in summer 1990, some 15 months before it
took effect. Mr Frost says: 'I did the initial announcement myself and then
we set up counselling sessions so that everyone was seen individually within
a week or so.
'I think people were very disappointed but we gave them a lot of notice
which deadened the pain. We had to trust the workforce to keep supporting us
during the relocation period, and they kept up manufacturing output right
through the move.' He adds: 'By going public to the workforce, it made the
whole thing very open and it did mean there were no rumours, everyone knew
what was happening.'
Fewer than half the staff were offered the chance to relocate. 'We were
setting up a different organisation culturally. It was a reincarnation
rather than a removal. We offered jobs to about 150 out of the 400 people at
Heston. Any employee had to be capable of adapting to the new systems and
practices of our reorganised company here. That was the criteria - was the
person sufficiently adaptable and, was his job actually going to be
relocated here?' The oldest employee to move is older than 60.
Weekend visits to Avon were organised and about 100 families arrived by
coach. 'To the average city dweller the thought of moving to the country
isn't always as attractive as one might think,' Mr Frost says. Meetings were
arranged with teachers from local schools and estate agents. 'A good
incentive at the time was that value for money in housing was significantly
better here than in west London.'
More than half of the workforce did not wish to, or could not, move. 'We
ended up relocating about 60 people. In terms of relocation we were very
pleased. We were told to expect possibly 10 per cent acceptances, so our
worst case was 15-20 employees and we trebled that.' For those who did not
move, Fairey offered what it describes as an enhanced redundancy package -
above the statutory requirements.
The company then set about recruiting 200 people locally. Mr Frost says, 'We
really are delighted with the attitudes, the capability and the interest of
the new employees we recruited in the area.'
At an early stage the consultants PE International were involved in the
project management of the new building and advising on personnel matters.
Bob Waghorn of PE acted as project manager - it was essential, says Mr
Frost, to have someone who did not have a line management responsibility to
supervise the move.
The Heston site, with its factory in converted hangars, was sold for Pounds
9m. The Claverham site of about nine acres, once a medieval manorial estate,
included listed buildings but had been used for some 200 years for
industrial purposes, first as a leather tannery and then as a tobacco
factory. Fairey consulted with the district council, Woodspring, over the
planning application for the new factory of 60,000 sq ft. The boardroom is
now in the Georgian house.
Fairey was not eligible for any grant aid, but Mr Frost said it received
support and encouragement from Woodspring marketing department and from
Bristol city council's economic development office. Graham Turner, chief
marketing officer of Woodspring, says the council had 'a good honest
relationship' with Fairey. 'We've been delighted - it brought 200 new jobs
to the district and safeguarded many existing jobs in the defence industry
in the area.'
For those employees who moved from Heston, Fairey offered a standard
relocation package covering legal costs, estate agents' fees, and some help
with accommodation while house-hunting. 'You have to be as flexible as you
can to deal with each family's circumstances,' Mr Frost says. 'We evaluated
using a relocation agency and decided in the end we could do it reasonably
well ourselves.'
The move coincided with the slump in the housing market which created its
own problems. 'We provided many months of support for people travelling to
and from west London. One or two are still letting their houses but the
majority did manage to sell, although one or two are still commuting.
Mr Frost comments: 'I think most of them are happy to have secured
employment and many find they are experiencing a better quality of life. But
quite a few have relatives back in London which puts a damper on things. Two
or three of the 60 have decided to return to London.'
The new factory started production in January 1992. 'We took the opportunity
to build a factory in tune with the 1990s, a wonderful opportunity not to be
missed when relocating. The most significant change was getting paperwork
out of the system, using modern data recording techniques and computerised
stores.' Fairey had been unionised at Heston, but at Claverham it set up an
elected forum. 'There have been no labour relations problems. We have been
very satisfied with the support our workforce has given us,' Mr Frost says.
Of the relocation, he says, 'I have no reservations whatsoever. It was the
right decision. But I wouldn't recommend it as a regular thing for a
company. There is a great deal of work if you do it properly and that can
make you take the eye off the business ball.'
Speaking with hindsight, he says: 'I think we were lucky to hit on the right
formula. It was important to have consultants in at the beginning who had
seen other companies go through it. We should probably have allowed slightly
more time for the final start-up operations. It worked but it was very
tough.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (7): No problem with shift around
globe - What can be done to assist individuals on the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR Gary Montesano and his wife Eileen, moving with International Business
Machines from a New York suburb to the south coast of England for a
three-year assignment has been made easier by the IBM corporate machine.
Mr Montesano is working on the development of the Merlin helicopter for the
Ministry of Defence. The Montesanos belong to the Merlin family group, which
has its own newsletter, and Mrs Montesano takes their children along to the
Merlin mother and toddler group.
The Montesanos, like other IBM employees and their families, are unlikely
ever to find themselves abandoned in a strange country with no social
contacts, no prospect of work for a spouse and an absence of advice on
schooling.
IBM is practised in shifting its employees around the globe, although the
moves have slowed down as a result of restructuring and cost-cutting.
Indeed, the company was so practised, the joke used to be that IBM stood for
I've Been Moved - or even I've Been Married.
Other companies with one-off or infrequent relocation requirements, within
the UK or overseas, may decide they do not have enough specialist knowledge
to deal themselves with the needs of employees' families. Alternatively,
they may decide that if the financial relocation package is generous enough,
it is up to employees to get on with sorting out their own problems.
Yet organisations may find themselves forced to face issues affecting the
relocating employee's family - in particular, spouses' jobs and children's
education - for they are increasingly the factors which deter employees from
relocating.
A survey by the Confederation of British Industry found that nearly
three-quarters of companies were meeting resistance from employees more
frequently than used to be the case because of worries about the loss of
partners' jobs. The cheerful, camp-following 'trailing spouse' is becoming
an endangered species.
As the CBI points out: 'The phenomenon of the dual earning couple is an
established feature of our current society. Not all women have career
aspirations but many women, nonetheless, are used to their own earnings and
financial independence. Consequently, many women may be reluctant to
interrupt their careers or give up lucrative jobs to accompany their
partners on international assignments.' The same resistance, for the same
reasons, is being shown by employees to moves within the UK.
One option open to companies without their own resources to provide advice
and support for families, is to use consultants - either approached directly
or as part of a package offered by the relocation companies such as Black
Horse, and Nationwide Relocation.
Andrea Eccles, partner of the City-based consultancy Quantum, specialises in
providing career counselling for spouses of employees who need to move
because of their jobs.
For Pounds 160 a person, for example, Ms Eccles will run a one-day seminar
for 10 people, covering the preparation of CVs, assessment of skills,
tracking down leads for jobs and how to go about finding childcare. The last
may be particularly important, she says, if a family is moving away from
grandparents or other relations who may have provided much of the childcare
in the past.
For those who are not intending to take up paid work in the new location but
are concerned about making friends and having a role in their new community,
Ms Eccles also provides advice on opportunities for voluntary work or, for
example, becoming a Justice of the Peace.
For about Pounds 200, a half-day session of individual counselling is added
to the day seminar, and for Pounds 425 the person being counselled will
finish their session with 50-60 job leads and ready-typed applications.
Some companies may wonder why they should bother to spend such sums on
individuals who are not even their own employees. First, Ms Eccles argues,
it may make all the difference between retaining and losing a skilled worker
over a move; second, the employee is likely to be happier and more
productive at work if they are happy and settled at home.
The same principles apply to help with finding new schools for the children
of relocating employees, according to Margret Price, who is retained as a
consultant by Nationwide Relocation. She is a partner with Dean Associates,
a consultancy based in Emsworth, near Portsmouth, which specialises in
giving advice on education.
Her charge is Pounds 445 a family, irrespective of how many children she is
asked to advise on - Pounds 540 if the family is moving to the UK from
abroad. After talking to the family on the telephone about their
requirements, she will produce a report on suitable schools in the area and
send on school brochures and any other documents. Approaches to the schools
contained in the report will already have been made to check places are
available.
The differences between education systems in different countries may cause
relocating families problems, says Ms Price. For example, those coming from
the US may expect to see their children graded every couple of weeks and
they may be alarmed by a greater emphasis in UK schools on individual
research and less on working to textbooks.
School starting ages vary from country to country - a six-year-old coming to
the UK may be a year behind classmates. Even a move from England to Scotland
can present difficulties: in England the academic year runs from the
beginning of September, in Scotland it is the beginning of March. All these
issues need considering before a move is made.
Relocating is a very stressful time for families as well as the employee who
is being moved, says Ms Price. 'There's a lot of focus on the property side,
but little on education or partners' employment,' she says. By paying for
expert advice, 'firms are buying an element of comfort for the family. It
shows a caring attitude to the family, as well as providing information
which will make it much more likely the family will settle,' she says.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (8): Review may opt for varying
standards - Contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTAMINATED land is likely to rank high among the worries of any manager
contemplating relocation.
With green shoots appearing and interest rates low, expansion or relocation
may seem tempting, and safer than it has appeared for years. But the threat
of contamination could make relocation impossible to finance; worse, if
discovered after the move, it could saddle the company with unexpected
liabilities.
The question has certainly given Whitehall officials unexpected headaches,
as national policy has just been shelved after four years of wrestling to
find a solution. The risk, officials and ministers fear, is that, as the
economy claws its way out of recession, redevelopment of former industrial
land could be hindered by the legislative uncertainty. As a result,
relocation may tend to favour environmentally risk-free zones, thus
increasing pressure on the green belt.
Although estimates of the amount of contaminated land in the UK vary,
Whitehall officials, industrialists and environmentalists agree that the
problem is there. According to a report last month by the Centre for the
Exploitation of Science and Technology, the industry-backed research group,
there could be some 100,000 hectares of contaminated land in the UK,
covering some 50,000-100,000 sites.
A widely-publicised appeal court ruling in November reminded companies, if
they needed reminding, of the potential liabilities. The court held Eastern
Counties Leather responsible for pollution of underground water tapped by
Cambridge Water, even though the contamination had occured nearly two
decades ago.
Detailed estimates of the potential costs of cleaning up the UK are
necessarily scarce. But according to CEST, the UK market in restoring land
quality could be worth Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 4bn between 1992 and the end
of century. It adds that this is around 20 per cent of the total spending
that will be needed to investigate and clean up fully - but
environmentalists regard these estimates as too low.
The government attempted to address these problems through Section 143 of
the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. This placed a duty on local
authorities to compile and maintain registers of potentially contaminated
land, which had been used in the past for certain specified industrial
activities.
However, the proposals for a register, which were made less demanding after
one public consultation, have now been scrapped following a second. The
registers aroused fierce and sustained opposition from the property
industry, industrialists and homeowners, because they would have recorded
potential rather than actual contamination. Critics argued that it would
cause property blight over much of the country, including perhaps a third of
the Black Country, the former industrial heartland.
Bankers and insurers warned earlier this year, in a report by the
government's advisory committee on business and the environment, that
raising finance for expansion where liabilities were hard to quantify could
be hard, thus restricting the ability of companies to move and grow.
The confusion over the government's intentions was increased when the
dropping of the register was followed rapidly by a postponement of the
similar 'duty of care' rules on waste-management companies, also part of the
1990 EPA, which would have imposed a unending liability for pollution from
landfills (rubbish dumps).
The government has said that the delay is caused by the technical problems
of harmonising EC and UK law. But it is clear that the local authorities'
obligations to monitor the pollution, and the question of where liability
would ultimately rest, similar questions to those raised by the register,
were also causing concern.
It would be wrong to suggest, as some environmentalists did, that the row
over the register proposals paralysed the industrial property market. In a
survey in January, property consultants Hillier Parker argued that the
market had not resorted to panic, but had rapidly become sophisticated in
judging probable liabilities and reflecting them in transaction values. 'A
majority of respondents said that they would make an adjustment in their
offer figure rather than withdraw automatically from the site', it
concluded.
But it is clear that a different approach is needed. The government appears
to have rejected the purist's - and environmentalist's - solution of
requiring local authorities to compile a full list of actual contamination,
because of the costs this would impose on them, which many of them, already
strapped for cash, could not support.
The government is now setting up a third, three-to-four month review to look
at where to go next. It is considering whether to adopt different standards
for different land, depending on future use: land buried under a car park
might need lower standards than that used for housing.
But according to Ms Clare Deanesly, of Gouldens, the solicitors: 'I don't
think the removal of the register has taken the issue away, now that it is
on the agenda. It has become a matter of local conveyancing practice.' She
points out that, in practice, planning authorities still have the authority
under separate regulation to impose the clean-up of land, and adds that 'in
practice (the register proposals) simply increased the issue's prominence'.
There is unlikely to be a single solution to the problem of how to identify
and clean up the UK's contaminated land, and how to finance that
improvement. It is clear from property companies' continuing worries that,
while they welcomed the dropping of the register, they would find removal of
the uncertainty an additional help in doing deals.
But the evidence of practitioners suggests that the market is finding its
own ways of dealing with the issue, and probable contamination is
increasingly reflected in the price.
Companies considering relocation cannot ignore potential contamination, but
are more likely than several years ago to find conveyancers and bankers who
can accommodate it with equanimity, and may find that it is not the
deterrent to moving that some once feared.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (6): Moving picture has slowed down
 -Prospects for the troubled property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEOLOGISTS tell us the southern UK is gradually sinking into the sea while
the north rises higher each year. The property market has finally adopted
the same motion after resisting for the last couple of centuries. Rents have
collapsed in the south, dragged down by the the contracting service sector.
They have not escaped north of the Wash, but the decline is less sharp. In
other words, the pressure to flee high occupation costs around London has
eased.
A great surge of relocation out of the south-east slowed last year and looks
like drying up before long.
But more than 'cost-push' factors are involved. Anyone looking to move has
to shed their old building, an almost intractable problem when few
replacement tenants are taking space.
Fewer than two dozen companies moved out of central London last year taking
just under 11,000 jobs, according to Jones Lang Wootton's annual office
decentralisation survey. That compares with 36 in 1991, the peak for
relocations. Only nine are scheduled to follow them this year and five
between 1994-96.
The picture could change, of course. Property costs were the main reason for
most moves and southern rents may rise again as the economy recovers. But
that seems unlikely in the near future with so much empty space on the
market.
The government may also begin another surge of reorganisation. Political
decisions to disperse civil servants into the provinces accounted for almost
40 per cent of last year's relocations compared with less than 20 per cent
in 1991. But the Treasury appears to have decided London is the best value
for its charges.
English Heritage and the Prison Service have both cancelled moves, while the
Ministry of Defence has juggled the number of posts involved.
Other current relocations might also have come to a stop if they had not
progressed so far. Plans were drawn up at a time when space was short, rents
high and labour scarce around the south-east. That is one reason why
companies were tending to move much longer distances.
By last year only 35 per cent were within the region compared with almost 80
per cent in the previous decade. Big movers in 1992 included Eagle Star to
Gloucestershire, the Departments of Social Security and Health to Leeds,
National Grid to Coventry, Nationwide Building Society to Swindon and the
British Library to North Yorkshire.
The taxman, true to reputation, was everywhere. Moves were organised to
Cardiff, East Kilbride, Salford, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, according to
JLW Research.
The top central London rent today is quoted by JLW at Pounds 37 a sq ft,
around half that during the boom. Even that is optimistic, as there is
plenty of space that owners would consider unloading at around Pounds 25 a
sq ft - plus incentives such as rent-free periods.
'That might still look expensive compared with Pounds 12 in Newcastle,' says
Jean Crawford, senior relocations consultant at JLW. 'But it still may not
compensate for the cost of moving.'
The CBI quotes an average of Pounds 24,000 to move each worker - although
that could rise as high as Pounds 40,000 when including incentives such as
guaranteed home-purchase packages. The chancellor did not help matters by
slapping a limit on tax allowances for such incentives in the budget.
It was all very different during the boom. 'Rents in leading provincial
centres ran at about 20 per cent of London costs through most of the
Eighties,' says Peter Evans, head of research at Debenham Thorpe. 'Then they
jumped rapidly to 70 per cent, reducing the incentive to move.' This was
partly due to a catching-up process as some provincial prices doubled, but
mainly because London crashed so quickly and so far.
Now everyone is feeling the cold. Rents in the regions fell by almost 16 per
cent in the 12 months to March, says Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, with only
Southampton and Aberdeen showing any uplift. In the same period, however,
London dropped far more, narrowing the financial gap. In the first three
months of 1993 rents have stabilised in some places but continued to fall in
the south.
Will decentralisation bounce back as the economy recovers? In theory it
should, as relocation is highest at times of expansion, when firms need more
or better space and find it hard to attract staff. But rents in London are
likely to lag the general economic revival because of the surplus space
available. 'Cost differentials between central London and the provincial
office markets are unlikely to start widening until the mid-1990s at the
earliest,' says the JLW report.
That does not mean moves will not happen. Short hops are by far the biggest
component in relocation but statistics are almost impossible to find unless
companies cross local authority boundaries.
'Despite the high profile accorded to major, long-distance moves, the great
majority of organisations relocate within the same town or city,' says Mr
Evans. Nowadays they are motivated more by the chance to pick up new
premises at rock-bottom prices. Every agent from Croydon to Carlisle will
tell you that the only business is coming from tenants within spitting
distance of the space they are offering.
Other pressures can also lead to moves. Mergers are likely to accelerate as
casualties of the slump are eaten up by stronger rivals. That can lead to
two buildings being given up in exchange for a third more suitable one. Even
the joining of healthy outfits can do this.
SmithKline Beecham took over The Fountains in Brentford, Middlesex, after
merging. This was no simple amalgamation under one roof, however, as the
scheme involved four campus buildings. But it served its purpose of giving a
new expression to the unified company's culture.
The great stumbling block to such moves, however, is getting rid of existing
space. Almost 30 per cent of City tenants questioned by Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley would like to use the low rents to find a better home but almost
three-quarters were having trouble disposing of existing space. The vast
majority are potential local movers who want to stay within the City, but
the same problem would apply if they were aiming to travel across the other
side of the country.
Landlords are no longer willing to take back leases when they know they may
never find another tenant. Assigning leases is also often out of the
question. Like many home-owners trapped in property worth less than the
mortgage, these tenants are paying passing rents far above the current
market level.
It would require a huge reverse premium to attract an alternative occupier
and that, like the extra costs of moving staff, can wipe out any financial
advantage in moving.
This is probably the main factor which undermined London's Docklands, which
for a while became the nation's favourite relocation target. Poor transport
and lack of facilities are still being quoted as reasons why companies
refuse to make the short hop from central London and cut their occupation
costs in half. But the real reason is the very public decision by the
administrators of Canary Wharf not to support pledges by failed developer
Olympia &amp; York to take over tenants' old leases.
Even the government could not save the day. It managed to keep relocation
totals ticking over by shifting thousands of jobs to Bristol, Edinburgh and
Leeds, but proposals to move the Departments of Transport and Environment a
few miles down river were howled down.
The silver tower's time will come, when it is too financially attractive to
ignore. But not this year - perhaps not this decade.
It may take that long for central London occupation costs to recover enough
to make a difference - and for relocators to find tenants to take their old
buildings.
The provinces, however, will drift upwards without any help from London's
cast-offs, relying on thousands of movers who are not so squeamish about
making such a short hop.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (5): Chance for a switch -
Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN UBS (formerly known as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew), the merchant bank, moved
to the Broadgate development near Liverpool Street station, London, in 1989,
its telecommunications and information technology department had 20 months
to prepare for the move, writes Mark Newman.
So crucial are telecommunications to the modern-day business that a company
move needs years of planning to ensure that the full range of voice, data,
public and private telecommunications services continues to function
smoothly during and after the relocation.
An interruption to service - what the industry calls an outage - can cost
tens of millions of pounds, even if service is resumed after only a few
hours.
Ms Sandy Malone is head of BT's Business Movers Programme - a team set up
last year to look after the needs of customers who are planning relocations.
BT allocates a project manager to a company planning to relocate, whose role
ranges from providing expert advice and taking instructions from the client
to masterminding and managing the project.
BT, for example, managed the installation of telecommunications systems for
Nissan UK at its Tyneside car plants. It has also managed a relocation for
British Airways. Some companies outsource their moves to third parties, such
as Andersen Consulting, because they do not want to be tied exclusively to
BT or Mercury.
At UBS, the in-house telecommunications and IT team managed the move itself.
'BT and Mercury were involved only on the periphery,' says Mr Graham
Marriner, UBS director of communications at the time of the move.
The main reason for keeping it in-house was that UBS had a chance to
reappraise its telecommunications services and network strategy.
Before the move, UBS was predominantly a BT customer but thereafter, it
handed over most of its outgoing traffic to Mercury, keeping BT largely for
back-up purposes.
Nearly all large companies buy both public and private network services from
BT and Mercury, both to encourage the two operators to compete on price and
quality, and to provide a back-up facility in case of technical
difficulties. But because switching to Mercury for incoming calls means
having to change telephone numbers, many companies keep BT for incoming
calls, and use Mercury for outgoing traffic.
UBS would have had to change telephone numbers anyway. Its move involved
bringing seven separate London offices under one roof and on to the same
number.
Switching to a new Mercury number, therefore, was no more of a problem than
taking a new BT number. More than 70 per cent of the company's traffic now
goes by Mercury.
Mr Graham Marriner reckons that the move resulted in 20 per cent savings in
annual telephone bills. This is partly due to the switch to Mercury. The
Cable &amp; Wireless company has always been cheaper than BT for long-distance
and international services, although the gap has closed over the last two
years since BT introduced bulk discount schemes.
BT's discounts packages Option 40, Option 50, Option 70 and Option 2000  -
provide reductions on basic charges in return for additional quarterly
payments. The higher the quarterly payment, the greater the discount on
calls.
Even with the discounts, however, Mercury remains on average 9 per cent
cheaper than BT, according to the 1993 Octagon Guide to Telecommunications
Tariffs, the independent price guide. And Mercury has responded to BT's
packages by introducing its own discount scheme, the Frequent Caller
Programme.
As well as the savings from switching to Mercury, UBS managed to cut its
phone bill by re-evaluating its use of private circuits. It replaced
thousands of analogue private circuits with higher capacity digital circuits
which, when broken down into individual voice and data channels, work out
much cheaper.
About 60 per cent of companies that relocate use it as an opportunity to
re-evaluate their telecommunications strategy. This can mean switching from
BT to Mercury, like UBS or vice versa.
But not all companies want to shake up their internal systems, and BT is
careful not to impose new services on its customers. 'Sometimes people get
sentimental about their old equipment,' says Ms Malone.
Most large companies plan their moves three to four years in advance, and
give themselves plenty of time to arrange for the installation of telephone
systems.
But this is not always true of small to medium-sized companies. 'When people
relocate, they often don't think about the time it takes to sort out
telecommunications requirements. They forget to call the telephone company
until very late,' says Ms Malone.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (4): Hard-hitting rules opposed -
How the Budget tax changes will affect companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR of the top five relocation management companies have formed themselves
into a consortium to lobby the Inland Revenue, Treasury officials and anyone
else who has the chancellor's ear over the changes he made in the March
Budget.
Mr Norman Lamont plans to raise Pounds 200m from a change of rules.
Relocation expenses are to be capped at Pounds 8,000 per employee. Over that
figure they are to be taxed as a perk of the job. The strict ceiling - which
overturns a 40-year-old principle that all reasonable removal expenses
should be tax exempt - is to apply immediately. Anyone accepting a job move
since the tax year began is to be caught, as well as all those making the
move after August 1.
The four management companies - Black Horse Relocation Services, Lloyds
Bank's specialist subsidiary and the market leader; Pricoa, longest in the
field and now owned by Prudential of America; PHH, the Californian-based
multi-service operation; and Hambros Bank offshoot, Hambro Countrywide
Relocation - reluctantly concede that this is no moment to defend unlimited
tax exemptions. But they intend to argue specifically that:
The Chancellor has picked his Pounds 8,000 figure out of the blue. The true
average cost of relocating is Pounds 25,600 according to a recent industry
survey. The tax exempt ceiling should be immediately lifted to Pounds
25,000.
The transitional timetable is unfairly tight; since companies take their
relocation decisions years ahead of a move, Mr Lamont's plan amounts to
retrospective taxation. The old system should apply to employees deciding to
move before April 6, 1994 and carrying out the move before April 6, 1996.
The third point has as much to do with a long-running battle between the
Inland Revenue and the industry as with the Budget. Under the 40-year-old
rules on relocation, tax relief was available on all reasonable expenses if
a job move involved a change of residence.
Good plain English, you might think. About 1987, however, some Inland
Revenue inspectors began to take a dim view of employees who merely rented
out their old houses rather than selling them before moving jobs. They
claimed that this did not amount to a 'change of residence' and housing
costs during the move were therefore disallowable.
Then came the property slump and failing to sell one's old home often became
involuntary. The management companies tired of overturning unfavourable
Inland Revenue rulings, case by case, on appeal. The consortium simply wants
the change of residence condition abolished.
Similar arguments are also being marshalled by the CBI; its chief executive,
Howard Davies, has written to Treasury Secretary, Stephen Dorrell,
protesting that relocation expenses are not a perk, and a meeting is to be
arranged with the Inland Revenue. The CBI, in fact, goes one step further
than the consortium: it wants the expenses ceiling abolished altogether.
Nationwide Relocations, the eponymous building society's subsidiary thought
to have the second largest market share, chose not to join the consortium.
Instead it will be making its own, separate but identical, submissions to
the Revenue, Treasury officials and MPs.
The consortium has hired one of the leading employee benefits tax
specialists, Michael Kaltz of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, to advise them. He
declares: 'I hope and have some anticipation that ministers and the Revenue
will move on this.'
But if they do not? 'Make no mistake, this will hit us hard,' admits Dominic
Yeo, marketing manager at Nationwide. He is speaking for the industry as a
whole.
Even before the Budget, professional relocation companies were thought to be
involved in little more than 25 per cent of the 100,000 or so annual
relocations linked to job moves. Three quarters of job movers must still go
it alone or rely on personnel officers or what the trade calls 'home
searchers' - estate agents offering to take on the burden of finding an
individual a new home in an unfamiliar town or county.
Professional relocation managers typically act as the employer's agent,
ensuring that transfers of key personnel go smoothly. Sometimes the company
itself is on the move, sometimes only the staff. In either case, finding new
homes is only a small part of the whole.
All the leading players are capable of funding an entire move, either by
means of offering bridging finance (against an indemnity from the employer)
or by buying up the vacated property (at a price based on an agreed minimum
valuation).
In a falling or sluggish market that can be expensive so any skill in
shortening the process is a selling point. Phoenix Relocation, a relative
newcomer to the industry in its present form, makes much of its 'open days'
on which it displays vacated houses to potential buyers after careful spring
cleaning.
The range of services includes advising incoming staff on schools or
opportunities for working spouses. It all depends on how much support the
employer offers.
And that is where the Budget will rub. Companies that need to move staff
will have to gross up the costs once they rise beyond Pounds 8,000 to
compensate individuals for the tax liability. But since the grossed up
amount will be treated as income and thus taxable, a second grossing up will
be necessary, and possibly a third. Michael Kaltz estimates that the tax
burden to the company could be 76 per cent under the Chancellor's proposals.
Michael Lansley, managing director of Hambro Countrywide which moved nearly
3,000 employees last year, believes the Budget will force companies to rely
less on moving employees and more on using available talent in the new area
 -which could damage individual career prospects and discourage job
mobility.
But the more immediate effect may be on the moving companies themselves.
Corporate budgets being what they are, especially during recession, company
directors faced with the increased costs imposed by the Budget, may have
little choice but to do without the extra services offered by professional
relocation managers, or even without them altogether.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (2): Budget a brake on mobility - A
look at the effects of the chancellor's tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE lines are being firmly drawn between relocation consultants and
the Inland Revenue over tax changes in the Finance Bill which could
fundamentally change the costs and patterns of employee moves in the UK.
Political consultants have been hired, clients contacted, position papers
circulated and influential MPs identified. Earnest lobbying to ameliorate
the effects of the chancellor's budget has begun.
Mr Steve Abbley, managing director of PHH Homequity, a relocation company,
says: 'Our main message is the cost of relocation is going to be increased
by at least 20-25 per cent. It will put a brake on mobility.'
His views are shared by three of his main competitors, Black Horse, Pricoa
and Hambro Countrywide Relocation. The four companies have come together in
a coalition to fight the tax changes. They are echoed by other similar
businesses such as Nationwide Relocation.
'I think the government has been amazed at the furore this has caused,' says
Mr Abbley. 'It's certainly stirred up a hornet's nest. I certainly don't
think they thought it through properly.'
Under the rules, employees could gain exemption from tax on expenses for
relocation reimbursed by their employers. Their employers, in turn, could
offset these costs against profits. Most reasonable costs could be offset,
including elements such as the loss on sale of a house in an area where
prices were stagnant or falling, moving costs, bridging loans and legal and
administrative fees.
But the position was enshrined only through two extra-statutory concessions:
A67 on compensation for higher housing costs at a new location, and A5 on
costs associated with moving to a new location. These run the risk of being
subject to discretion by tax officials and applied differently around the
country.
While upper ceilings on allowances were vague, in practice Mr Michael
Lansley, managing director of Hambro Country Relocation, says: 'It was all
pretty straightforward. You just bunged (the expenses) in and they were
allowable.'
That will all change if the Finance Bill in its current form becomes law
later this year. For the first time, the chancellor has proposed a ceiling
on moving expenses against which tax can be allowed. It stands at Pounds
8,000. The concession on higher housing costs is withdrawn completely.
In exchange, the bill permits tax relief against the value of any bridging
loan up to the Pounds 8,000 limit where this has not already been exceeded
by the costs of removals. The Inland Revenue says ministers will table an
amendment so the reliefs will apply to UK residents moving abroad or foreign
nationals seconded to the UK.
It also stresses employees will not have to sell their home to gain tax
relief against moving expenses, as long as their old home is not within
'reasonable daily travelling distance' of the new place of work.
The changes offer cold comfort to the relocation campaigners and argue they
will have at least two detrimental effects. First, costs of moving to
employers and employees will increase substantially. The consultants
estimate the average move costs about Pounds 25,000 - a figure also
mentioned by the chancellor in his budget. Anything above the Pounds 8,000
limit will be counted as a taxable employee benefit.
That means either the employee or the employer will pick up extra costs.
Figures calculated by the relocation coalition suggest these estimates may
be wrong. That is a particular concern, with those considering moving
concerned about negative equity in their existing houses.
Mr Lansley says: 'We've had a great deal of reaction from clients. They are
faced with grossing up (relocation expenses) which will mean a considerable
extra budget that they or their employees will have to pay.'
As a result, the second impact of the budget change, according to the
coalition, is that the number of moves may well fall. 'An awful lot of
people who were planning group moves may think again,' says Mr Abbley. He
warns this, in turn, could have a wider economic effect on towns such as the
Development Corporations which have actively courted corporate relocations.
'It goes very much against the government's stated intention to increase
jobs,' says Mr Lansley. 'What they are doing here is not encouraging
economic recovery at all.'
Mr Michael Kaltz, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, who
has been retained by the relocation lobby, raises a further problem. He says
there will be greater confusion and more risk for error and hence penalties
on tax returns by employees complying with the new rules.
He argues that the change to the treatment of relocation expenses is
essentially the introduction of a new form of tax. He says the Finance
Bill's concessions - notably the statement that employees will not have to
sell their old home - have only brought about a position which most people
would have expected to be in place under the existing rules.
Mr Kaltz also argues that the proposed Pounds 8,000 limit to tax relief was
carefully thought through by the Inland Revenue, based on an estimate of the
number of moves each year and projections of the cost. The aim, he says, was
to raise Pounds 200m and the tax-free ceiling was adjusted accordingly.
He questions the reliability of these estimates - although others would
argue that the relocation lobby's figures of an average of Pounds 25,000
may, conversely, be over-generous.
The relocation consultants are calling for reconsideration of three
principal areas. First, to raise the tax-free limit on relocation expenses
from Pounds 8,000, perhaps up to the preferred level Pounds 25,000.
Second, to consider extending transitional relief further into the future
beyond this tax year, since the changes would otherwise add to costs of
moves which are already under way.
Third, to revisit the issue of which categories of help given by employers
to employees should qualify for statutory tax relief.
The Inland Revenue says that any amendments to the Finance Bill are a matter
for the politicians to decide. 'No doubt ministers will take note of the
representations,' a spokesman said.
But it stresses the chancellor's argument that the existing position
unfairly discriminates in favour of individuals whose employees pay for
their moving expenses. Those who move without such benefits must take the
full cost themselves, while those with employers who agree to pay are being
subsidised at taxpayers' expense.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (3): New broadside for companies -
The changes in business rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE depths of recession, companies were hit by a new broadside of rising
costs called the uniform business rate. They wriggled, they screamed, they
protested that higher expenses at a time when profits were collapsing would
drive many to the wall. They were right.
The south saw most casualties, which was inevitable considering the way the
new tax was structured.
Although introduced in 1990, it was based on property values set two years
earlier - the peak of the surge in property prices.
The valuations also caught up with huge changes that had taken place since
the previous assessment almost two decades before, so the jump was that much
more severe.
Now a new broadside is being loaded, as the business community faces a
revaluation due to come into force in 1995. This time the guns will face a
new direction, however. Property values were assessed last month, and again
show enormous changes but they are heavily in favour of the south.
At one time every business fleeing London seemed to quote soaring local
authority rates as a main reason for the move. By the same logic, plunging
bills under the new system should bring them flocking back.
Relocation is not as simple as that, of course, yet the cuts could have an
important input into decisions about future moves around the country.
'In general terms the 1995 revaluation will reverse the shift in burden that
occurred in 1990,' says Robin Goodchild of Gerald Eve Research. 'The winners
are primarily in the south-east, especially office occupiers.' Losers are
spread across the rest of England and Wales (Scotland has its own system),
particularly offices in rival centres. In other words, the occupation cost
gap, already narrowed by convergence of rents, will be closed even further.
The changes will be nowhere near as severe as last time around because they
will not be making up for almost 20 years of neglect.
But property values have still shifted dramatically since 1988. In
Birmingham, for instance, they have almost doubled, compared with a 40 per
cent drop in the City of London.
'Most areas are likely to experience an increased level of rateable value in
1995 though this will often be modest,' says Stephen Tutcher of Gerald Eve.
'Central London is the principal exception, with values reducing to 50 per
cent or less of current values.'
Rate bills for prime office space in the City will fall from more than
Pounds 24 a sq ft to less than Pounds 15.50, says Sandra Jones of Herring
Baker Harris Research.
A West End block will drop from just over Pounds 21.50 to Pounds 14.21,
Southwark from just over Pounds 13 to Pounds 8.12 and Hammersmith from
Pounds 9.25 to Pounds 7.31.
'The relative benefits that the impending revaluation brings to the London
market are accentuated when compared with some of the increases in rates
payable expected in provincial cities,' she says in an HBH report, Shifting
the Burden, which looks at the impact of the changes on 66 UK centres.
Milton Keynes, for instance, will see a 40 per cent rates rise, Manchester
as much as 73 per cent while in Cardiff they will more than double.
Industry will also feel the wind of change. Good industrial space in
Newcastle will have a current rates bill of 70p a sq ft based on a rent of
Pounds 1.75 in 1988.
Today the rental value is around Pounds 4.50, implying a 100 per cent rate
rise to Pounds 1.83 a sq ft in 1995. Staines, near London, on the other
hand, has a current bill of Pounds 2.41 based on a 1988 rent of Pounds 6 a
sq ft.
Those rates should rise only 25 per cent to just over Pounds 3, although the
absolute cost of an extra 53p a sq ft will still be on a par which a
Manchester or Liverpool business will have to find. This shows that
decisions on relative location advantages will not be simple.
Shops, which saw an immense upheaval in 1990, will be less affected this
time but a retail building in Manchester will still see rates rise more than
50 per cent to almost Pounds 67.83 for Zone A space.
London bills will creep up only marginally because rents have remained
stable since the boom. There will still be a big gap, as a West End shop
will be paying more than Pounds 91 a sq ft, and the narrowing that does take
place will have little influence on relocation trends. Retailers are not
great players in this field. But it could give a boost to decisions over
investing in new stores outside the south-east.
Office-based business will be affected far more because the changing balance
of rate burdens will exaggerate the same trend in rents.
'If open market rents for prime space are around Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 a sq
ft at present and we assume a 5 per cent growth (by 1995/6), this will mean
a decrease of more than 20 per cent in the cost of occupying new office
space in the capital,' says Ms Jones.
This combined impact of lower rents and rates will slow even further the
drift away from central London, particularly as tenants realise they will be
able to take advantage of lower local authority charges for a further five
years, even if rents begin to rise again.
All sorts of other complications muddy the picture, however. For instance, a
company considering whether to move today already has to calculate the costs
of being stuck with existing older space it cannot sub-let. At least
revaluation will set rate bills according to current rent values, which are
likely to be much lower than the amount passing to the landlord. Whether
that is enough to tip the balance in favour of a move remains to be seen.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (1): Key factor is labour - Inward
investment has fallen back from recent high levels as a result of the
economic slowdown worldwide. The UK benefits from relatively low wage rates
but it faces growing competition from eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF RELOCATION is an industry, it is suffering from the recession like any
other industry. There are two aspects to this. First, the UK economic
slowdown is having an impact on domestic firms. Second, inward investment by
foreign multinationals has dropped sharply, mostly because of recession
worldwide.
The domestic effect is explained by Mr David Rees, a relocation specialist
with the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. 'What drives relocation,' he says,
'is mostly cost pressures, such as labour and rents. In a recession, these
pressures are lower.'
As for inward investment, the fall in activity must be put in the context of
the extra- ordinarily high levels of recent years. According to the
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), inward
investment in the UK in 1990 was Dollars 33.8bn - more than a fifth of the
OECD total, and nearly 40 per cent of all investment into the EC. In 1991,
the figure fell by 38 per cent. In the first half of 1992 it fell a further
29 per cent.
The reasons were twofold. First, industry worldwide was investing heavily in
the boom conditions of the late 1980s.
This was particularly true of Japan, which was a vitally important investor
in the UK over the period. The Japanese stock market bubble of the late
1980s provided Japanese manufacturers with virtually interest-free finance,
and encouraged excessive investment both at home and overseas.
The new Japanese plants in the UK turning out cars and consumer electronics
have done much to assist the UK's faltering balance of payments. They may be
the last of their kind for a while.
The second reason has to do with the establishment of the European single
market. This encouraged foreign manufacturers to move into the EC, with the
UK proving an obvious home on grounds of cheapness and the English language.
It also caused upheaval within existing European industry, as manufacturers
sought to rationalise production in the face of new competitive pressures.
As the celebrated case of Hoover showed earlier this year - whereby a plant
making vacuum cleaners in Dijon is being shut and production moved to
Glasgow - the UK benefited here as well.
The Hoover case brought to the fore an issue which now dominates the outlook
for relocation into the UK: the social chapter. The UK has been accused -
for instance, by the French government - of trying to make itself into the
Taiwan of Europe. It has been accused of social dumping  - seeking an unfair
advantage within the Community by keeping its employment costs artificially
low.
On the other side of the argument, UK employers - Nissan of Japan included -
are vocal in the pleas that the UK's natural advantage of cheap labour
should not be taken away from it by Brussels bureaucrats.
In fact, some of the argument is misplaced. The social chapter has only a
limited amount to do with employment costs, nor is it by any means clear
that the UK's sole advantage as a location within the EC lies in the
cheapness of its labour.
Nevertheless, the argument will continue to run. One or two economists are
already suggesting that if the UK is basing its employment strategy on cheap
labour, it is running a serious risk in the long term. The fall of the
Berlin wall opened up a vast potential reservoir of cheap labour to the
east. At present, the transitional upheaval in central European economies
and the poorness of their infrastructure mean the threat is limited. But
both those problems will surely be overcome in time.
The nature of the threat is illustrated by a firm such as ABB Lummus
Chemoprojekt, a western-owned process engineer based in the Czech city of
Brno. Mr Gernot Gross, managing director, says that for the qualified
engineers used in his industry, the UK is the cheapest source in western
Europe. 'If German costs are 100,' he says, 'UK costs are only 70. But Czech
costs for the same quality of work are 40.'
In the end, as Mr Rees of Ernst &amp; Young remarks, labour is the key to most
relocation decisions: either it is cost, or it is availability. This applies
within the UK as well. In cost terms, there are still significant
differences between the south-east of England and the rest of the country.
Indeed, according to Mr Rees, there is less difference between the other
regions than between them and the south-east.
Within the UK, though, many other factors come into play. For an office
location, the deciding question may be whether it is within two hours of
London by rail. For a manufacturing operation, much will depend on how much
of the output is shipped locally and how much exported.
Another important aspect, of course, is government incentives. Some 35 per
cent of the working population of Great Britain, according to Mr Rees, live
in so-called assisted areas.
At present, the map of these areas - last drawn in 1984 - is being drawn
afresh. The work was supposed to be completed by January this year, having
been promised by the government as an election commitment. It has been held
up, however, by the debacle over coal closures, which has complicated the
picture on employment levels in various parts of the country.
The government has proved unhelpful in another respect. The Budget sprang un
unwelcome surprise: a change in the tax breaks allowed on relocation
expenses, designed to raise Pounds 200m a year for the Inland Revenue by
1995.
In essence, the plan is to limit tax relief on relocation expenses to Pounds
8,000 and to prevent employers indemnifying employees free of tax for losses
on property sales. The Relocation Solicitors' Group, based in London, says:
'Many in the relocation industry believe the proposals amount to a tax on
mobility and will prevent companies from taking full advantage of the
opportunities presented to them as they emerge from recession.'
Not everyone takes such a gloomy view. Mr Rees says: 'It's not a serious
impediment. It affects the economics slightly, but in the context of the
whole cost of relocation - closure and set-up costs, training and so on -
it's not significant.'
In any case, as Mr Rees points out, most relocations occur not between
regions, but within them. Often, this is precisely so that the workforce can
be retained. A company may have outgrown its premises, or aim to find
somewhere cheaper. Very often, it will end up staying within a 20-mile
radius.
But to the extent that relocation between regions does go on, which are
winning and which losing? The question cannot be answered with any
precision, since no statistics are available. The one clear pattern still
seems to be that the south-east is losing out to the rest of the country.
'As for the other regions,' says Mr Rees, 'Leeds has been doing well for
some office projects lately, and south Wales on manufacturing. And within
the last month or so Glasgow seems to have picked up several good ones - not
just Hoover.'
Despite the pressures of recession, it seems the relocation industry
continues to thrive. From a broad economic viewpoint, this is to be
welcomed. One of the abiding paradoxes of the UK economy is that the
so-called equilibrium level of unemployment - the rate below which inflation
starts to accelerate - should be so much higher than in most developed
countries.
A decade ago, that was commonly blamed on the power of the trade unions in
forcing up wages. But the unions are now a spent force, and still the
equilibrium level of unemployment has continued to rise.
Whatever the answer to the puzzle, the mobility of labour must have
something to do with it. In general terms, the more relocation is going on,
and the more flexible and mobile the labour force, the better the outlook
for employment.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that the 'big nine' UK television companies will shortly be allowed
to bid for each other prompted activity among a number of TV stocks.
Of the nine, the two strongest bid candidates are seen as HTV, which jumped
almost 10 per cent, gaining 4 at 50p, and Anglia, which rose 9 to 296p. Of
the potential bidders, Carlton added 17 at 756p, although more on
consideration of results earlier in the week. Central, which might be poised
to launch a bid for Anglia but could be attacked by Carlton as it already
owns 20 per cent, advanced 15 to 1888p.
Ulster TV, which would not be affected by any regulatory changes and which
is unlikely to attract a bid because of the political nature of its region,
rose 18 to 414p. A large buyer in Scotland was said to be responsible.
A strong US recommendation for Reuters Holdings was given added impetus as
SG Warburg reiterated its support for the stock. The shares threatened to
test the 1400p level at one point and settled 21 higher at 1373p.
Expectations of improved trading news from Tesco at today's agm led a
resurgence in food retail stocks. The rise was underpinned by a feeling in
the market that the bad news in the sector was now in the price and several
stocks were beginning to look cheap.
Fears over margins being squeezed by dicount operators in what is seen as a
maturing market has seen several brokers turn bearish on the sector this
year. However, recent sessions have been punctuated by the odd change in
sentiment, and this week's results from Argyll Group prompted a flurry of
positive recommendations. Yesterday, shares in Tesco sprinted 7 1/2 to 220
1/2 p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 487p and Argyll 8 1/2 to 336 1/2 p.
The Pounds 199m cash call from Hammerson was widely predicted and the 'A'
shares rose 4 to 344p. The ordinary shed 7 to 373p. But the move gave an
excuse for profit-taking in other property stocks, which have been strong
performers in recent sessions.
Sedgwick's Pounds 41.5m convertible bond issue triggered switching from the
ordinary to the convertible stock, which was said to have been snapped up by
Continental investors. The shares dipped 4 to 163p.
SG Warburg raced up 23 to an all-time high of 717p after well received
preliminary figures.
Guinness recovered strongly on positive market comment following the agm on
Wednesday. The shares later slipped on the back of a profits warning,
although this was seen by drinks specialists as a knee-jerk reaction to a
widely forecast situation. The stock was up a net 15 at 475p. Guinness's
talk of US recovery helped Grand Metropolitan, 8 firmer at 395p.
Strong results from Morland saw the shares gain 12 to 500p, cheering other
regional brewers. Mansfield Brewery climbed 12 to 500p, Wolverhampton &amp;
Dudley 9 tp 509p and Greene King, which has a substantial holding in
Morland, 9 to 554p.
Dealers said Glaxo suffered at the hands of US options traders. The drugs
group's shares had been up 4 at one stage but a very large trade in puts,
options to sell shares at a fixed price and on a certain date, right across
the pharmaceutical spectrum rippled through to the London market, where the
shares ultimately closed 6 lower at 612p.
Despite a cautious agm statement, Inchcape continued to benefit from a
broker's recommendation made earlier this week and a gentle squeeze. The
shares put on 11 at 587p.
An upbeat statement from industrial group Suter at its annual meeting sent
the shares 9 forward to 153p. The company has increased its stake in
engineering group James Wilkes - a penny easier at 80p - to 16.45 per cent.
Smiths Industries came under pressure, with NatWest Securities reported to
have had a large line of stock on its books. The shares closed 5 lower at
334p.
Shrugging off an MMC report critical of its contact lens business, Boots
surged 8 to 437p. Dealers said the stock benefited from improving sentiment
after recent underperformance.
Confectioner Thorntons retreated 26 to 144p as it announced a restructuring
of its French operations.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas was the most heavily traded stock on the London market as UK and
overseas funds switched out of BP and Shell. Turnover in Gas was, however,
inflated by a sizeable bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal
Oil sector specialists said the oil majors had strongly outperformed Gas
since the start of the month as the market reacted sharply to worries about
regulatory intervention and about the outcome of the inquiry into Gas by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due to report in July. Both BP
and Shell were helped by excellent quarterly results released earlier in the
month.
Gas edged up 4 to 294p, boosted by rumours emerging from the traded options
market that the MMC inquiry was turning in Gas's favour. BP eased a penny to
311p and Shell lost 2 1/2 to 611 1/2 p, sentiment unsettled by a profits
warning from Elf, the French-state owned oil company.
Recent buy notes from Kleinwort Benson and Salomon International continued
to support Lasmo, up 2 at 153p, while rumours of a gas discovery in the
North Sea and expected good news from two other wells helped Goal improve to
50p. Premier edged up to 28 1/4 p as the market looked forward to results
from the latest drilling operations off the Burmese coast.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatPower pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market gave the thumbs up to a solid set of profit figures from National
Power but was much more enthusiastic towards the 16.2 per cent increase in
the dividend total, boosted by the proposed 1.5p final dividend. Dealers
were pleased with the not unexpected final dividend, which followed the
second interim payment made after the budget changes.
Much of the latest bout of buying interest in NatPower was said to have come
from overseas, with Salomon International a big buyer. Mr Michael Sayers,
utilities analyst at Salomon, acknowledged that Salomon clients had been
aggressive buyers. 'The figures were in line but the 16.2 per cent dividend
increase is an indicator of dividend growth prospects moving on to a higher
plane after the coal contract,' he said.
At the close NatPower was 11 ahead at 346p after heavy turnover of 6.3m.
PowerGen added 11 1/2 at 358p with 4.4m traded. The Scottish generators also
performed well, Hydro- Electric moving up 6 to 341p and Power 6 1/2 to 321p.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US tax sellers hit ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPIDLY approaching break-up of ICI saw the chemical giant's shares
crank downwards against the market ahead of the key meeting today to give
the final nod to demerger. On Tuesday, the chemical rump is set to begin
trading as ICI and the bioscience side as Zeneca.
Yesterday's slide was inspired by selling of ICI shares in the US, where
funds currently holding a total of some 8 per cent of the outstanding equity
face a tax charge. The new Zeneca shares are to be treated as income in the
US and some investors are expected to sidestep the tax burden by selling ICI
and using the cash raised to buy into ICI 'new' or Zeneca afterwards.
The situation was the same in the UK but the company instigated a test case
in April which ruled that Zeneca shares could be treated as capital.
Existing ICI shares fell 12 1/2 to 1255p yesterday. ICI new lost 10 to 614p
in spite of weighty research by Smith New Court, which expects the slimmed
down company's earnings to treble between now and 1995.
James Capel, however, feels that earnings recovery is already discounted by
the current price and prefers Zeneca, which was marginally firmer yesterday
at 640p ex-rights, and 3 ahead at 44p in the nil-paid stock.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME IN stock index futures showed a marked improvement from the previous
three sessions, inspired by increased activity from leading securities
institutions, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was recorded at
2,860, but after an initial advance it went into retreat when a leading
securities house came into the market as a seller. This sent June falling to
2,850 and turned out to be the first sign that the larger institutions had
spotted opportunities to trade; lack of interest by these large funds had
been a significant feature of the previous three sessions.
When the selling order had been completed, June moved steadily forward for
the rest of the morning, with the news of the government reshuffle making
little impact on trading.
The afternoon brought a further advance and the day's high of 2,869 came
around 2.30pm, although a late bout of profit-taking meant June was unable
to sustain earlier momentum. It finished at 2,862, up 8 from its previous
close and around 3 points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash
of 5 points. Turnover improved to 8,911 contracts.
Volume in traded options was 26,402 lots. Some 8,703 were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option and 2,278 in the Euro FT-SE option. GEC, Argyll Group and BP were
the day's most active stock options.

FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas factors boost UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS little immediate reaction on the UK stock market to the widely
predicted reshuffle of the UK government headed by Mr John Major. The
replacement of Mr Norman Lamont by Mr Kenneth Clark as UK chancellor of the
exchequer was not unexpected - or even unwelcome - in the City and investors
appeared prepared to wait for the first move from his successor, whose
pro-ERM views may find a mixed response on the stock market. However,
equities took their cue yesterday from a relatively steady performance in
sterling and gilt-edged securities.
Some analysts commented that Mr Clarke appears less committed to the
anti-inflation, hard money, line of his predecessors and that this may make
his appointment more acceptable to the equity market than to the gilt-edged
sector.
However, the gain of 8.4 to 2,855.3 in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday was
inspired by international, rather than domestic, events. Prospects for
another early cut in UK base rates remained on much the same rating, hopeful
rather than expected.
A firm opening in UK shares reflected new peaks overnight in New York and
Hong Kong equities, and was sustained by firmness in Tokyo and by a further
advance on Wall Street as it opened its new trading session. These factors
helped the London market to shrug off a Pounds 199m rights issue from
Hammerson, the UK property group.
Share prices held their firmer ground for most of the session, with the
exception of a brief period when the market became confused as it waited for
confirmation of the details of the reshuffle of Mr Major's Cabinet.
Once again, it was a trading session driven by corporate news rather than by
wider economic factors. Traders reported further buying of the defensive
sectors of the stock market, ranging through Britain's overseas earning
companies to the domestic brewery stocks which have been hard-driven in
recent sessions.
Wider uncertainties were reflected by a check to the steady rise in second
line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slipped 5.9 to 3,169.6 in its first
daily setback since the middle of last week.
Seaq volume increased from Wednesday's 626.8m shares to 660.5m, with
non-Seaq business making up about 62 per cent of yesterday's total. Retail,
or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.43bn on Wednesday, reaffirming
satisfactory levels of profitable business after a brief slowdown earlier
this week.
Mid-morning brought a sizeable trading programme which appeared to be
weighted on the buying side and focused on three important sectors -
building, banking and merchant banking and insurance issues. Trading volume
was also boosted by the second leg of a batch of large tax deals traded at
the close of the previous session.
The Footsie was restrained by a reaction in oil shares to the gains of
recent sessions and by slower trading among the UK banks. But renewed demand
for Reuters, the international global information group, and also for BAT
Industries, provided features among the blue chips.
The broader range of domestic consumer stocks, still looking for
confirmation of recovery in the domestic economy, lacked firm direction.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits new high as hopes
rise for package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
BLUE CHIP stocks climbed to new heights yesterday as hopes rose that
President Bill Clinton's tax-raising deficit-reduction package would be
approved by the House of Representatives, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.67 higher at 3,554.83, another
record close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, ended 1.03 off at 452.41.
The American SE composite gained 1.80 at 438.93 and the Nasdaq composite was
up 0.50 at 704.59. New York SE volume came to 301m shares.
The markets picked up where they had left off on Wednesday, when heavy late
buying lifted the Dow to its second record finish in a week. Analysts had
anticipated fresh early gains, primarily because stocks traditionally do
well in the days leading up to a long weekend. On Monday the markets will be
shut for the Memorial Day holiday.
Attention was firmly focused on Capitol Hill, where the House was due to
vote on the Clinton economic package last night. Although investors are not
particularly keen on Mr Clinton's plan to raise taxes, they fear that a
defeat in the House would be a severe setback for his presidency. Moreover,
the markets, especially the bond market, are generally supportive of the
package as it appears to be the first meaningful attempt by a US government
to reduce the huge budget deficit.
Chevron jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 88 5/8 on news that the oil group
planned to reduce the size of its businesses through a restructuring
programme which will include the sale of some refineries and cutbacks in
retail fuel sales operations. The restructuring will require a Dollars 550m
second quarter charge.
Morgan Stanley climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 66 after the securities
house unveiled a 40 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, and
announced that it had found a buyer for Sweetheart, the disposable food
service product manufacturer. The deal will allow Morgan Stanley to
eliminate its costly bridge loan to Sweetheart.
Student Loan Marketing, which has been hit recently by speculation
surrounding the administration's plans to shake up financing for students in
higher education, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 in busy trading after
broking house Smith Barney lowered its rating on the stock.
Canada
TORONTO again displayed a firmer tendency after a substantial day's
business. The TSE 300 index ended 4.5 up at 3,869.7 and rises led declines
by 415 to 298 after volume of 67.9m shares. Golds rose 2.3 per cent as the
New York spot gold price gained USDollars 5.75 an ounce.
Northern Telecom tumbled CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 45 3/4 on rumours that
Goldman Sachs had downgraded the company.
Seagram slipped CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 37 1/8 in brisk trade after the
Dominion Bond Rating Service said it was placing the firm's debentures and
commercial paper under review and Moody's said it may cut ratings on its
senior debt. Earlier this week Seagram bought 2.1m Time Warner shares.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors drawn into Brazilian
equities - Sao Paulo's strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has a monthly inflation rate of nearly 30 per cent and the average
tenure of a finance minister is about two months, but its equity market is
still dancing. On Wednesday, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa index
registered its twelfth consecutive gain.
The Brazilian market is up by more than 15 per cent this month in dollar
terms. Daily turnovers of Dollars 150m, once unprecedented, have been the
norm this week. Part of the spurt can be explained by the market's
favourable reaction to the appointment of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a
former senator and foreign minister, to the finance post. The Bovespa jumped
7.1 per cent last Thursday, the day after a midnight cabinet reshuffling
transformed Mr Cardoso into President Itamar Franco's fourth finance
minister since he took office in October.
Mr Cardoso, a sociologist turned politician, may not be a 'man of the
market', as traders say. But 'he has demonstrated that he is a serious
politician, and he has good common sense', in the words of Mr Ronaldo
Nogueira, a director of the Brazil Fund, a close ended fund managed by the
US investment firm Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark.
The euphoria over Mr Cardoso's appointment only tells part of the story.
Brazil is the only Latin American market to show an overall gain this year,
according to figures released by the International Finance Corporation.
Foreigners are taking note. In April a record Dollars 1bn entered Brazilian
capital markets. This was offset by remittances of Dollars 657m, but the
Dollars 350m balance was also a record since institutional investors were
first allowed to operate directly in Brazilian markets in mid-1991.
Many analysts believe that investors have been attracted by stock prices,
about half of book value on average, considerably lower than in places such
as Argentina and Mexico.
Investors have also been attracted by favourable company results. Leading
companies have reversed dismal performances in 1991 and early 1992, often
showing dramatic improvement in the fourth quarter of 1992 and the first
quarter of 1993. Examples can be drawn from diverse sectors: Villares (a
manufacturer of elevators and steel), Brasmotor (home appliances), Duratex
(wood products and home fixtures), and Alpargatas (textiles and footwear).
Even though analysts had been predicting the profits upturn, its
confirmation provided a psychological boost - and a much-needed source of
hope for Brazil's short-term future. 'If companies are doing well in the
current environment, what will they be able to do if things get better?'
asked Mr Robert Barclay, president of Baring Securities Brasil.
There have also been some improvements in economic data. Industrial sales
are up, led by a strong recovery in the automobile sector. Trade
liberalisation was reflected in record imports of Dollars 2.43bn in April,
while robust exports ensured a healthy trade surplus of Dollars 589m. Partly
as a result, international reserves stand at a comfortable Dollars 23bn.
Analysts offer other explanations for this year's upswing. In January and
February, electric utilities helped to sustain the market. Their shares were
in the spotlight as legislation that would allow them to set higher prices
worked its way through Congress. More recently, President Franco's
determination to cut interest rates has moved money out of fixed income
investments and into equities.
Trading remains hopelessly concentrated in shares in Telebras, the
state-controlled telecommunications holding company. On Wednesday, Telebras
shares were responsible for 61.5 per cent of trading volume, a common
occurrence. Telebras accounts for nearly half of the Bovespa index.
'There is some demand for other shares,' notes Mr Julius Buchenrode,
director of investments for Banco Chase, Chase Manhattan Bank's subsidiary.
'But there is no liquidity because most companies have not issued stock in
several years.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cuts make little
impression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate cuts in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria did nothing,
apparently, for their respective equity markets, and performance elsewhere
was mixed, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved further ahead on the gentle recovery in the bond market and
gains in bund futures, the DAX index ending 12.47 higher at 1,634.47, its
highest close for almost two weeks.
Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.8bn, utilities and chemicals seeing buying
interest. Veba and Viag rose by DM5.40 to DM390.80, the former topping the
active stocks list in turnover of DM729m. Among the big three chemicals,
BASF ended DM5 up at DM230.40, Bayer gained DM3.70 to DM265.70 and Hoechst
DM2.90 to DM245.70.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, said that Veba's first
quarter results, excluding extraordinary items, had come out better than
expected.
Of chemicals, he said that after extensive profit falls, or losses in other
cyclical sectors, like steels and carmakers, chemicals were at least still
profitable, probably the first sector to go for on a cyclical upturn, and
producing in countries like Spain (which have devalued their currencies) and
the US, where recovery is apparent. His personal view, however, was that
this enthusiasm was premature.
PARIS broke through the 1,900 barrier for the first time since early May.
The CAC-40 index closed 14.16 higher at 1,904.59, helped by today's expiry
of May index futures. Turnover was FFr3.5bn.
Credit Local de France, a specialised financial institution, featured after
the government said that it would be the first privatisation candidate, with
an offer price expected to be about FFr400. The shares slipped FFr15.90 or
3.8 per cent to FFr404.10.
Elf Aquitaine was another faller, down FFr6.60 to FFr376.20, after
forecasting a 25 per cent drop in operating profit for the first half of
1993.
MILAN continued to focus on Fiat which fell further ahead of its results on
Monday. The shares fixed down L246 or 3.8 per cent at L6,105, before
dropping to L5,900 on the kerb.
Some brokers attributed Fiat'sdecline to profit-taking following strength in
the stock during April. The investigation of Mr Cesare Romiti, the chief
executive, in connection with the country's corruption scandal has also
weighed on sentiment. Hopes of a possible link-up with Renault of France
have all but evaporated and the possibility that the group will cut the
dividend on Monday has added further to selling pressure. The Comit Index
closed 11.18 lower or 2 per cent at 540.81.
Other leaders suffered from Fiat's fall with Generali off L730 to L37,100.
Banks also declined with Mediobanca down L550 to L15,550.
ZURICH showed a speculative undertone as foreign investors bought banks as a
proxy for the strong Swiss franc, and the SMI index rose 21.10 to 2,268.10.
In banking, UBS rose SFr13 to SFr990 and CS Holding SFr40 to SFr2,630 but,
said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, the speculators came in for
Bank Leu which rose SFr34, or 7 per cent to SFr498 on stakebuilding rumours.
AMSTERDAM, not surprised by the cut in interest rates which now stand at
their lowest level since mid-1989, moved in a narrow range throughout the
day: the CBS Tendency index ended unchanged at 106.5.
Royal Dutch and KLM were both strong on US interest, the former closing at a
new high for the year, up Fl 1.70 at Fl 168.40, and the latter firming 30
cents at Fl 26.60.
MADRID extended this week's climb, the general index rising 3.25 to 262.58.
Mr Jose Sevilla, head of research at the brokers, FG, said that investors
were anticipating a conservative win in the forthcoming elections, and with
that lower interest rates and a weaker peseta.
Banks made the most obvious response to this scenario, Central Hispano
leading with a gain of Pta200, 6 per cent to Pta3,560.
OSLO was lifted by a strong performance from the shipping sector. The
all-share index gained 5.17 or 1.1 per cent to 476.32 while the shipping
index advanced 3.4 per cent on hopes of an upturn. Turnover was NKr552m.
DUBLIN made its third gain in succession, the ISEQ overall index rising
12.24, with the accent on financials, to 1,566.27 for a three day gain of
2.7 per cent.
TEL AVIV rose more than 2 per cent after the issue of new shares in Bank
Hapoalim, the country's largest bank, was heavily over-subscribed. The
government's sale of its 20 per cent stake in the bank is part of the
process of privatising the industry. The Mishtanim index rose 4.33 to 205.04
in turnover of some Shk150m.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo eases as volume
swells to 750m shares

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATE futures-led selling erased early gains as a strong yen appreciated
further against the dollar, the market ending mixed in active trading,
writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average finished 43.36 easier at 20,852.63, after a session high
of 21,105.91 and low of 20,786.47. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 13.99 at 1,653.71, however. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 2.84 at 1,263.10.
Volume reached 750m shares, against Wednesday's 481m, as active early
foreign buying was replaced later by profit-taking and arbitrage-related
selling. Advances outscored declines by 698 to 379, with 104 issues
unchanged.
Brokers said the 225-issue Nikkei average is relatively insensitive to
recent foreign exchange fluctuations, market participants regarding the
yen's advance against the dollar as temporary.
The broader Topix index, they added, is more representative of current
market sentiment, having outperformed the Nikkei during recent sessions, and
is less susceptible to the arbitrage unwinding that often hits equity prices
during late activity.
Financial sector issues, which equal about 30 per cent of the first section
on the Tokyo stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation, drew
considerable amounts of buying by individuals yesterday.
The sector, overall, has largely underperformed the market and some
investors speculate that bank shares will form a sizeable portion of the
forthcoming capital-weighted stock index futures index.
Fuji Bank appreciated Y140 to Y2,270, Mitsubishi Y100 to Y2,780 and Sumitomo
Y90 to Y2,250.
Fanuc, the leading Japanese machine tool maker, retreated Y80 to Y4,100,
partly due to its projection that pre-tax profits will decline by about 9
per cent in the current financial year.
The car sector declined, Toyota by Y60 to Y1,670, Honda Y40 to Y1,350 and
Nissan Y24 to Y775. Pharmaceutical issues retreated on profit-taking,
Yamanouchi by Y40 to Y2,420 and Daiichi Y10 to Y1,710.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 177.96 up at 23,080.88 in volume of 35.9m
shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of the region's markets set record closing highs yesterday.
HONG KONG was lifted by reports that the Sino-UK airport committee would
meet next week to discuss financing for the project. The Hang Seng index
finished at an all-time peak, 97.52 or 1.33 per cent ahead at 7,447.24.
Turnover increased to HKDollars 6.3bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 5.4bn.
HSBC Holdings strengthened HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 74.50, Hang Seng Bank
advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 59 and Bank of East Asia rose HKDollars
1.25 to HKDollars 38.25.
SINGAPORE also set a new closing high, with investors encouraged by data
showing a 7 per cent growth in GDP for the first quarter. The Straits Times
Industrial index climbed 17.27 to 1,885.91. Cycle and Carriage rose 45 cents
to SDollars 7.45 on rumours that the Jardine group, of Hong Kong, might make
a takeover offer.
AUSTRALIA advanced to a 3 1/2 -year high, helped by strength in US markets
and gold stocks. The All Ordinaries index moved ahead 31.7, or 1.85 per
cent, to 1,749.1, while the gold shares index put on 49.5, or 2.65 per cent,
at 1,918.8. Turnover amounted to ADollars 516.06m.
National Australia Bank continued to perform well after last week's positive
results, gaining 15 cents at ADollars 10.10.
Among gold issues, Placer Pacific forged ahead 24 cents to ADollars 3.74 and
Newcrest added 10 cents at ADollars 4.48.
NEW ZEALAND, meanwhile, continued to push ahead, recording another 33-month
high in spite of remaining in negative territory for most of the session.
The NZSE-40 index closed 1.88 firmer at 1,642.42 in turnover of NZDollars
33m.
There was strong activity in Carter Holt Harvey, mainly from overseas
investors, but the shares ended 3 cents down at NZDollars 2.99.
KARACHI was boosted by Wednesday's supreme court decision, which came after
the close, to restore the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister.
The KSE index moved forward 29.01 to 1,171.26 and rising issues outnumbered
declines by 214 to 58.
SEOUL was firmer on strong overseas interest in large-capitalisation stocks.
The composite stock index rose 7.31 to 737.22 in turnover of Won1.01
trillion, compared with Won726.6bn on Wednesday.
BOMBAY weakened for a fourth consecutive session following the easing of
restrictions on short-selling earlier in the week. The BSE index dropped 31
to 2,220.

<TEXT>
STERLING money market dealers yesterday contradicted the views of their
colleagues in currency markets, taking the view that another near-term cut
in UK base rates was less likely after Mr Kenneth Clarke was appointed as
the UK's new chancellor, writes James Blitz.
As news filtered out yesterday morning that Mr John Major was planning to
reshuffle his cabinet, dealers in sterling futures bid the near-term
contracts up to new highs.
A strong view in the market is that the Major government has sought an
escape from its political difficulties by cutting base rates in an attempt
to stimulate the economy. As news emerged that a reshuffle of the cabinet
was imminent, the June short sterling contract rose 4 basis points to 94.09
and the September contract gained another 5 basis points to 94.25.
After the announcement of Mr Clarke's appointment, the market retraced
sharply. In part, this may have been due to the 'buy on the rumour and sell
on the facts' principle.
But several dealers accepted that a new chancellor would be unlikely to
reduce base rates at a time when he needed to establish credibility with
foreign exchange markets.
The June contract finished at 94.04, down 1 basis point on the day, and the
September contract closed 6 basis points lower at 94.14. At this level,
dealers are still contemplating the idea that base rates could go down.
Sterling cash rates were mostly unchanged on the news. Three-month money
ended unchanged at 5 29/32 per cent. The overnight rate of lending dropped
to about 4 per cent on the back of a shortage of Pounds 800m which was
easily despatched.
In Europe, yesterday's strong performance by the D-Mark gave a lift to
Euromark futures and upset the recent trend of bullish thinking about French
franc interest rates coming down.
The D-Mark's strength was mostly the product of intense selling of the
Spanish peseta. But the German currency's rise of nearly a centime against
the French franc raised speculation that France might not be able to
continue pushing official rates below German ones with the same esprit.
The September Pibor contract, therefore, fell 14 basis points on the day to
a close of around 93.18. Three-month French francs rose from 7.37 per cent
to 7.43 per cent.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Peseta dips below central rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH peseta came under heavy selling pressure against the D-Mark in
the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, falling below its new
central rate against the German currency and raising speculation that it
might have to be devalued again, writes James Blitz.
The peseta fell as a result of the growing feeling that Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
Spain's socialist prime minister, would lose the forthcoming general
election and that Spanish interest rates would come down in a bid to
stimulate the economy.
After closing in London on Wednesday night at Pta77.88 against the D-Mark,
the peseta plunged to a low of Pta79.50, beyond its central rate against the
D-Mark of Pta79.11.
The currency later rallied to end in London at Pta78.83. Several dealers
suspected yesterday that the currency was ripe for another devaluation.
However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, felt that departure
from the ERM was unlikely because Spain won large EC aid at last year's
Edinburgh summit. Mr Mark Brett of BZW believes the currency might hold at
current levels because Spanish bond yields are an attractive 4 per cent
above Germany's.
The Spanish currency's fall raised some fears about the stability of the
ERM, triggering short-term currency flows into the D-Mark.
However, there was widespread belief that the D-Mark had also profited from
comments made earlier in the week by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central
bank governor, who had been reported as saying that the European Monetary
System had effectively broken down. 'That was the most blunt condemnation of
the ERM from a central bank governor that I have heard for a year,' said one
analyst.
The D-Mark was up nearly a centime against the French franc at one stage,
before closing at FFr3.371 from a previous FFr3.368. The German currency
also closed 2 pfennigs stronger against the dollar at DM1.6120; it moved
further ahead in New York to end at DM1.6033. Heavy buying of Swiss francs
was also reported, with the currency, often seen as a safe haven, ending at
SFr0.891 per D-Mark from a previous SFr0.896.
Sterling fell back 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark on the day Mr Kenneth
Clarke was selected as the new UK chancellor, closing at DM2.5075.
The pound's weakness was partly due to speculation that Mr Clarke, who is
left-of-centre in the Conservative party, might introduce another base rate
cut to stimulate the economy. But sterling's retracement was also explained
by heavy technical resistance at DM2.52. 'There has been widespread
profit-taking and people are taking another look at sterling,' commented a
dealer.
The dollar slipped lower against the yen in Europe in spite of two bouts of
intervention from the Federal Reserve. It closed at Y107.80 from a previous
Y108.60, and in New York fell to Y107.15.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's Hill of Gold digs
deeper for a secure future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTLE is on to lengthen the life of Brazil's biggest primary gold mine,
Morro do Ouro, or the Hill of Gold, which is also one of the lowest grade
gold mines in the world - two tonnes of ore has to be processed to liberate
one gram of the precious metal.
Even so, it has been a profitable venture since it was brought into
operation at the cost of USDollars 65m in 1988 because the rock is very soft
and the gold comes out easily.
Last year MdO contributed more than Pounds 8m to the net profits of RTZ, the
UK group which owns 51 per cent and operates the mine, up from Pounds 6m in
1991. A Brazilian company, Autram, owns the rest of MdO.
The mine produced 166,600 troy ounces of gold in 1992, slightly up from the
165,900 ounces the previous year.
But, as MdO goes deeper, the rock is getting harder; last year Dollars 13m
of plant modifications were completed to treat harder ore.
These modifications should enable the mine to maintain a production rate
only slightly below that of 1992. The target for this year is 162,750 ounces
of gold.
Now the mine management, working with RTZ Mineracao, the UK group's
Brazilian holding company, is looking for ways to extend the life of the
mine beyond 2001.
At stake are the 445 jobs directly provided by the mine and another 448
provided by the mining contractor.
Mr Ludovico Costa, general manager, is sure costs can be reduced further,
even though the mine's cash operating costs have already come down from
Dollars 258 an ounce in 1988 to Dollars 170.
Last year costs were reduced partly by negotiating a new contract with the
mining contracting company - which agreed to cut charges by 30 per cent to
retain the work - and by the introduction of new mining methods.
These do away with all blasting of ore, which is now simply scrapped up by
conventional bulldozers.
This change also eliminates one source of friction with residents of
Paracatu, only a mile from the mine, some of whom complained the blasting
was damaging their property.
Lower costs would enable rock with even less gold in it to be processed
economically, so that perhaps three tonnes would be treated to produce one
gram of gold.
There is also gold in sulphide rock which, if it could be economically
treated, would extend the mine's life to 2014.
A pilot plant at the mine has shown the ore can be treated to give up its
gold but MdO still has to find an economic way of dealing with the sulphuric
acid that would be generated.
Another possibility is for ore from satellite deposits, with similar ore
from nearby, to be processed into a concentrate, an intermediate material,
that could be trucked to the nearby mine for further upgrading.
Malaysian tin miners, in a desperate bid to bolster record low prices, want
export curbs on major producers to be scrapped, a move that is likely to win
government backing, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish exports hurt by global
recession after record 26% rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NEW Zealand fishing industry is being affected by world recessionary
trends and is unlikely to repeat last year's record jump in exports, which
rose 26 per cent to NZDollars 1.34bn (USDollars 734m), the chief executive,
Mr Ray Dobson, said yesterday.
However, the setback would be temporary, he suggested, adding that the
industry was on target for sales of NZDollars 2bn by the year 2000.
Mr Dobson, releasing the board's annual economic review, said that in
addition to suffering softer world fish prices, the NZ industry had also
been badly affected by the effects on shellfish of the toxic algal bloom,
which forced this part of the industry to shut down for as long as five
months. The last ban on harvesting shellfish was lifted on Wednesday.
The board said 'everything came right' in 1992 - exchange and interest rates
and catches. Seafood sales earned NZDollars 1.34bn, of which NZDollars
1.22bn came from exports. There was a 10.6 per cent rise to a total 657,266
tonnes in the catch in the economic zone around the country.
Japan was the biggest customer, buying NZDollars 409m, followed by the
United States NZDollars 291m, Australia NZDollars 122m and Europe NZDollars
120.5m.
Sales of hoki, a whitefish thought valueless till the mid 1980s because it
has a boney backbone and is difficult to fillet, were the biggest export
earner, up from NZDollars 151m to NZDollars 233m. But Mr Dobson said prices
for hoki had fallen by up to 20 per cent this year, partly as a result of
black market Russian cod flooding the European market.
Orange roughy, a mainstay of the US restaurant trade, saw a sales rise of 16
per cent to NZDollars 159m. Rock lobster (crayfish in New Zealand), earned
NZDollars 101.8m. About 75 per cent of lobsters are exported live to Japan.
Catches by foreign fishing boats chartered by New Zealand companies rose by
50,000 tonnes to 400,000 tonnes, mostly due to a big rise in trawling for
southern blue whiting in the Pacific Ocean south of New Zealand.

COPPER prices ended easier on the LME after a session of wide price
movements, pulling other metals lower as well. Dealers said copper's
weakness was prompted by recent successive failures above Dollars 1,850 a
tonne for three-month metal, and the market broke downwards below Dollars
1,820, with liquidation, sell stops, and option sales driving prices down to
Dollars 1,795 at one stage. On the London bullion market GOLD remained
locked within the now well established range between Dollars 372 and Dollars
380 a troy ounce. 'There are (sell and buy) stops building up on either side
of this range,' one dealer said, adding that if gold managed to break
through either side, 'we would see a Dollars 5 movement very easily.'
London's robusta COFFEE futures reversed an earlier advance and finished
lower as the recent bout of fund and chart-related buying appeared
temporarily to dry up. New York's arabica coffee was lower across the board
at midday on long liquidation linked to July's early inability to test
10-week highs scored earlier this week. Chicago WHEAT futures were lower at
midday amid light fund selling, which pressed nearby contracts to lifetime

FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Escondida has backing for
Dollars 284m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A USDollars 284m expansion of Escondida in Chile, already the world's second
largest copper mine, has been given the go-ahead by government lending
agencies in Finland, Germany and Japan, which provided most of the money for
its start-up at the end of 1990.
The expansion will increase Escondida's output by half and will play a key
role in Chile's drive to add value to its copper riches. Part of the
expansion involves a unique method of producing copper cathodes, which will
give Escondida and Chile 80,000 tonnes of copper metal a year after
production begins in August 1994.
Also, some of the extra concentrate (an intermediate material) from
Escondida will go to feed a new smelter being put into service this year by
Refimet, a Chilean company, which will produce 75,000 tonnes of copper metal
annually, and the Enami smelter which is being expanded.
This means that from 1994 about 25 per cent of the Escondida concentrate
will be upgraded to metal in Chile. Today none of it is.
Escondida is owned by BHP of Australia (57.5 per cent), RTZ of the UK (30
per cent), a Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi (10 per cent) and the
International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent).
The company signed 12-year supply contracts with smelters in Finland,
Germany and Japan as part of the financing package and government lending
agencies in those countries loaned about 60 per cent of the Dollars 824m
needed to get the mine, 3,000 metres up in the Atacama desert, into
operation. It was the biggest single foreign investment in Chile's history.
As senior lenders, the agencies had to give unanimous approval for the
expansion, which will be funded from Escondida's cash flow.
The expansion will take output from 390,000 tonnes this year to 420,000 in
1994 and 480,000 in 1995.
A substantial portion of the increased output will come from a Dollars 164m
solvent extraction electrowinning cathode plant to be built near some of
Escondida's existing operations at the port of Coloso, 14km kilometres from
Antofagasta.
This will use hydrometalurgical technology, patented by Escondida and
developed in BHP's California laboratories, which uses ammonia to leach
copper out of the ore, producing the purest copper in the world, 99.999 per
cent pure.
This technology works only with certain types of ore but is particularly
effective with Escondida's. Mr Steve Kesler, manager of planning and
business development, said Escondida would be willing to consider making the
technology available to other producers.
He said the expansion would increase productivity as it would add only 200
to Escondida's present workforce of 960 and annual output per employee would
rise from 320 tonnes to 380 tonnes.
Mr Kesler said hectic activity by copper companies in northern Chile had
encouraged two new coal burning power stations to be built in the region and
once Escondida had the benefit both of lower power costs and economies of
scale from the expansion, operating costs in real terms would drop 20 per
cent by 1995.
Escondida does not reveal its operating costs but some observers estimate
them at below 50 cents a lb. One indication of Escondida's profitability is
that RTZ reported that net attributable earnings from the mine last year
were Pounds 41m, up from Pounds 30m.
Mr Kesler said the recent sudden drop in copper's price had not deterred the
owners from pushing ahead with the expansion. 'At 80 cents a lb we can meet
all operating, capital and debt repayment commitments,' he said.
While customers with long term supply contracts would not increase their
purchases from Escondida, new customers had been lining up in Poland, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Spain and Sweden, attracted by the
mine's clean, high-quality concentrate.
Other elements in the expansion include an increase in mining capacity by
the purchase of one of the world's biggest mechanical shovels, which can
lift fifty cubic yards with one scoop and costs Dollars 9.5m, and twelve
haul trucks at Dollars 1.7m each. Expansion of milling capacity will cost
Dollars 83m.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Late US maize planting cuts
output expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELAYS IN planting maize in the US because of rain are the main reason for
an expected reduction in world coarse grain output, the International Wheat
Council said yesterday.
In its first estimate for 1993, the IWC puts world production at 828m
tonnes, down from 1992's record 856m tonnes but well above the five-year
average of 804m tonnes.
Smaller harvests in Western Europe, the former Soviet Union, South America,
China and India also help account for the production decline.
Consumption is forecast at 845m tonnes, up from 827m tonnes the previous
year. The IWC cites rising animal numbers in the US and strong feed
industries growth in middle-income developing countries such as Brazil and
Mexico.
World trade in coarse grains is expected to decline 3m tonnes to 89m tonnes.
The IWC has also revised downwards its forecast for 1993 wheat production to
564m tonnes from last month's 566m tonnes.

REVERSING a 108-year tradition, members of the Chicago Board of Trade have
voted to open their agricultural futures and options contracts one hour
earlier in the hope of gaining more European business.
While the exchange's busy financial futures trading floor has undergone
several changes in its trading day over the last decade - including the
introduction of a night bond session - its 3 hour and 45 minute grain
trading session has been sacrosanct.
CBoT traders have opened their grain markets at 0930 CDT and closed them at
1315 CDT since 1885.
Now, as the EC institutes its CAP reforms and European cereals prices are
expected to become more volatile, the CBoT wants to have its pits open
earlier in the European day.
The move, exchange leaders contend, will ward off budding competition in
agricultural derivatives from London's Futures and Options Exchange (Fox)
and France's Matif.
One day before the vote, CBoT traders had said it was too close to call.
However, the proposal passed with a relatively wide margin, 583 votes to
347.
Plans for a 0830 CDT opening must now be approved by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. The CBoT hopes to implement the earlier opening before
the end of the year.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway oil costs seen rising
steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING expenditure for oil companies in Norway is set to rise steeply to
NKr53bn (Dollars 7.7bn) in 1998 from a current forecast of NKr40bn this
year, or 44 per cent of total industry expenditure, according to a report
soon to be issued by Edinburgh-based oil analyst Wood Mackenzie.
The increase comes at a time of weak oil prices, declining production from
mature fields and increasing pressure on operators from their partners to
contain operating expenditure.
According to the analyst, average operating costs in Norway are higher than
for other North Sea sectors at around Dollars 5.30 per barrel of oil
equivalent (boe) compared with Dollars 4.50 in the UK and Dollars 3.80 in
both the Netherlands and Denmark.
WoodMac says the imposition in 1991 of Norway's carbon emissions tax had a
significant impact on operating costs and is estimated to have accounted for
about 5 per cent of total operating expenditure in 1993, raising about
NKr2bn for state coffers.
The analyst forecast average operating costs in the short-term to remain at
the current level of NKr40 per boe, contained by a steadily rising
production profile, rising to NKr46 by the late 1990s, which WoodMac says is
a source of concern.
'From the mid-1990s the rising cost of production from declining mature
fields will not be compensated for by output from new field developments,'
the analyst warned.

<TEXT>
THE FLEDGLING Shanghai Metals Exchange has become the world's third largest
one year after its opening, but the first anniversary this week of its
formation has not proved particularly auspicious.
The market, in line with the slide on other metal exchanges, plunged to its
lowest point since its opening.
An exchange spokesman said trading had become more volatile since a Reuter
link was installed this week. Traders were now reacting to up-to-the-minute
reports of price movements in London and New York. By May 24, the SHME had
traded 8.34m tonnes of non-ferrous metals. Volume totalled Yuan153.4bn
(UDollars 26.8bn) for the year.
Mr Sheng Kunxin, vice present of the SHME, blamed this week's price slump on
international factors, China's tighter credit policies, a weakening local
currency and gloomy world economy.
'On the whole the market has remained stable,' said Mr Sheng. 'Prices for
some metals fell because they were affected by the London market and the
grim world economy - we are quickly fully integrated with the world's metals
market.'
The SHME plans to increase domestic brokers from the present 55 to 68. It
serves more than 1,000 customers in China and plans to include foreign
members by the end of the year when the dealing system is brought into line
with international practice.
Six metals are traded on the SHME - copper, aluminium, zinc, tin, nickel and
pig iron.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Increased hopes of rate cuts boost bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A MORE resilient D-Mark and increased hopes of interest rate cuts lay behind
a strong advance in the German government bond market.
Although recent Bundesbank signals had damped hopes of cuts in key rates at
next Thursday's council meeting, reductions of up to  1/4 point in the
Netherlands, Belgium and Austria were regarded as improving prospects of
German cuts.
Worries about the German economy pointed in the same direction. A leak of
GDP figures, due to be released on the morning the Bundesbank council meets,
showed a 1 per cent fall quarter on quarter and a 3 per cent slide year on
year.
The June futures contract rose to 94.47 from a 94.08 low.
The Dutch rate cuts led to further widening of the 10-year yield spread
below German bunds to 17 basis points.
RAMPANT talk of interest rate cuts in Spain, which faces a general election
on June 6, led to a rally in the government bond market.
The peseta at one point fell through its central level in the ERM but
managed some recovery to help stave off rumours that the currency might
leave the ERM. The rally drove down the yield on 10-year stock to less than
11 per cent.
THE UK government bond market largely shrugged off the replacement of Mr
Norman Lamont as chancellor, although it did register small losses after a
bright opening in the wake of Wednesday's successful gilt auction.
While the pound was weakened by talk of a cut in interest rates by the
incoming chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, gilts ended little changed.
Economists expressed scepticism about an imminent cut in rates, although
some already had one pencilled in for later in the summer.
US Treasuries eased slightly across the board as investors and dealers
digested the big gains earned at the long end of the market.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 102-
17/32 , yielding 6.919 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was down
 5/32 at 99- 25/32 , to yield 4.224 per cent.
The day's only economic data, a flat weekly jobless claims report, had no
effect on sentiment.
Later in the day, shorter-dated securities lost a little more ground on
reports that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee had voted
unanimously at its meeting last week to shift the emphasis of monetary
policy towards a tightening.
THE yen's record high against the dollar gave the Japanese government bond
market a flying start in Tokyo, which was later undone by profit-taking.
This ended a sharp two-day rally which had reduced the yield on the cash
benchmark No 145 due 2002 from 4.70 per cent to 4.52 per cent at one stage
yesterday. The close in Tokyo was 4.575 per cent.
In London trading, intervention by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar
provided a setback for the JGB market, but it recovered later.
The Liffe futures contract opened at 107.02 and closed 5 basis points higher
after hitting a low of 106.78.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P upgrades Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, has upgraded the Republic of
Portugal's long-term foreign currency debt from A+ to AA - .
The new rating has been assigned to the Y75bn five-year Eurobond issued in
January. The bond's launch spread over the comparable Japanese government
bonds was about 75 basis points, but it widened to the mid-80s. Yesterday,
the spread narrowed by about 7 basis points, bringing it down to 70 - 75
basis points.
Daiwa Europe, one of the lead managers, said the change would open up the
Republic's Eurobonds to more institutional investors but others would still
be deterred by the split rating.
Moody's, the other big rating agency, has not altered the A1 rating it
assigned in 1986.
Mr Manuel Pinho, director general at the Portuguese Treasury, said the main
aim was to create a benchmark and to continue pushing out the maximum
maturity of the bonds issued. Portugal plans to borrow a further Dollars
2bn-Dollars 2.5bn by the end of the year. The state's annual public sector
borrowing requirement is running at just over Dollars 3bn, about 4 per cent
cent of GDP, down from 12 per cent in 1985.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA considers shortening
bond settlement time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to shorten substantially the standard settlement period for Eurobonds
are being put forward by the market practices committee of the International
Securities Market Association.
Traders at ISMA's annual meeting in Copenhagen will be asked to consider
shortening the seven-day settlement period to two or three days.
Mr John Dowsett, deputy chairman of the committee, said this would bring the
Eurobond market into line with other markets.
Mr Dowsett and the committee favour two-day settlement, which is the
standard in the foreign exchange market and most domestic bond markets.
Shorter settlement periods are favoured by regulators because they reduce
the amount of systemic risk, by cutting the period of exposure between trade
and settlement dates. But the market has been slow to respond: four years
ago the Group of Thirty set a target of three-day settlement by the end of
1992
If the Mr Dowsett's proposal finds favour with ISMA members, the next step
will be to set up a working party consisting of regulators, fund managers,
global custodians, the two Eurobond clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel,
and ISMA representatives. Mr Dowsett hopes a new standard could be
introduced on January 1 1995.
The move to two or three-day settlement would bring tangible benefits to
trading firms. First, by reducing exposure, it would reduce the amount of
capital tied up by trading, freeing up capital for other areas of business,
such as the derivatives markets.
From the trader's point of view, quicker settlement would also reduce
counterparty credit risk. Under the current system, counterparty credit
limits are constantly under pressure, with traders often exceeding the
internal limits placed on their exposure to any single counterparty.
On a technical level, switching between markets would be easier if they had
similar settlement periods.
Objections to the proposals could come from firms servicing retail
investors. Regional representatives of ISMA have already canvassed members.
'There was some negative feedback from Belgium,' said Mr Dowsett but the
volume of retail business is small and could continue to use seven-day
settlement. In other words, there would be a two-tier market with most
trades settling in two or three days.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Milan SE in further moves to
modernise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILAN stock exchange is set to lose its reputation for having one of the
longest settlement periods in the world for orders with the introduction of
a new timetable designed to cut settlement from six weeks to just three
working days.
The settlement plan is part of a broader campaign to modernise Italian
equity trading and belatedly make Milan more competitive with other European
bourses.
It follows moves in the past two years to reform the stockbroking system and
begin screen-based trading of some equities.
The move to screen-based trading, which has been extended to include the
shares of 39 companies, together with the inauguration of a clearing house
for deals form the basis of the shift to speedier settlement.
Under the new proposals drawn up by the Consob stock market and companies
watchdog, settlement will take place on the third business day after a trade
is made. Full details of how the system will work will be ready in
September.
The new practice is due to start on January 17 next year, after having been
preceded by a lengthy training and testing phase, due to begin in the final
quarter of this year.
As previous deadlines for other bourse innovations have slipped badly,
dealers may regard the latest timetable as indicative.
However, Consob has made no secret of the importance of quicker settlement
to improve efficiency and transparency on the stock exchange, indicating
that the changes are bound to take place, even if a little behind schedule.
Meanwhile, screen-based trading is due to make another leap in July, with
the inclusion of shares in about 40 more companies.
The expansion of the scheme will, in turn, lead to the inauguration of
futures trading on Italian stocks, although that is considered to be still
some way off.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Cemex Dollars 1bn deal sets benchmark
for Mexican debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEMEX, the largest cement company in Mexico and the fourth largest in the
world, yesterday launched the biggest Eurobond ever by an emerging market
name with a Dollars 1bn, five-year offering.
The deal will set a benchmark among Mexican issues and was well-received in
the market. Cemex plans to use the proceeds to refinance existing debt on
more favourable terms, reducing its overall financing costs and extending
the average maturity of its debt.
Part of the proceeds will refinance the balance of a Dollars 1.1bn bridge
loan related to the acquisition last year of two Spanish cement companies -
Cementos Sanson and Valenciana - while the rest will be used to prepay
Cemex's 9.41 per cent notes due May 1996.
The 8.875 per cent bonds due June 1998 were priced at 99.53 and rose to
100.375 by late afternoon. The yield spread over US Treasuries was 370 basis
points at launch, and tightened to 345 basis points.
'It was a blow-out,' said one dealer involved in the deal, saying the bonds
had been priced to ensure they would trade at a premium.
JP Morgan, the book-runner, said the deal met strong institutional demand.
Cemex is well known in the capital markets and has seen yield spreads narrow
considerably: the spread on its seven-year bonds due 1999 has fallen from
450 basis points at launch to 345 basis points recently.
Two other Latin American names tapped the dollar sector yesterday: Banco
Safra and Banespa, two Brazilian banks, with deals of Dollars 55m and
Dollars 100m respectively. There has been a flurry of Brazilian banks
borrowing in the Eurobond market recently, as the terms are more attractive
than in the domestic market.
The Republic of Italy launched a Dollars 300m tranche of its 10-year bond
issue, a further step in its recent bond exchange offer.
Meanwhile, the EIB launched its first dragon bond issue, a Dollars 500m,
five-year offering which is listed in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg,
and aimed at investors in the Asia-Pacific region.
The dragon bond market has seen borrowers such as the ADB, NIB and GECC. One
or two European sovereign names are said to be exploring this area in the
hope of raising funds at lower costs.

STATE Bank of New South Wales, the Australian public sector regional bank,
has fallen into the red.
After abnormals, the bank turned a first-half ADollars 10.6m profit into an
ADollars 89.6m (USDollars 62.4m) loss. This reflected a ADollars 95.9m
abnormal loss mainly due to tax changes.
Before abnormals and tax, the bank turned an ADollars 15.5m profit into a
ADollars 20.3m loss following a 46 per cent rise in doubtful debt charges to
ADollars 109.8m. A tax credit of ADollars 26.6m put the bank ADollars 6.3m
in the black before abnormals.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria blames interest costs
for plunge into red
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FONDIARIA, the big Italian insurance group controlled jointly by Ferruzzi
and the Gaic holding company, reported a group loss of L494.4bn (Dollars
4.55bn), compared with a net profit of L68.8bn in 1991.
The group, which this month sold its 21 per cent stake in Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungs of Germany for DM985m (Dollars 604m), attributed the
loss to interest costs on borrowings to finance its ambitious expansion,
notably into Germany via AMB.
Among other factors cited were losses in re-insurance business, underwriting
losses at some subsidiaries and write-offs on the book value of other group
companies.
The poor results, which had been widely expected, have triggered strong
rumours that Fondiaria may be sold or split up. However, Mr Carlo Sama, a
senior Ferruzzi executive, said yesterday that the company was not for sale.
Outlining restructuring plans, Fondiaria said it would sell a variety of
non-strategic assets and re-examine its activities in a variety of areas not
strictly linked to insurance, leading to speedy disposals.
The disposals would be restricted to assets outside insurance, or other
activities which were not majority-owned by the group.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan's banks count the cost of
bad loans - The earnings data which understate the scale of the burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Japan's 11 leading commercial banks yesterday announced their combined
non-performing loans totalled Y8,435bn (Dollars 78bn), they gave an
indication of the problems confronting them, but collectively understated
the scale of the bad loan burden.
In encouraging the banks to itemise their bad loans, the finance ministry
hopes to inspire public confidence in the banking system, but the very
narrow definition of what constitutes such a loan itself inspires concern
about how deep the cracks run.
The figure does not include 'restructured' loans, those on which interest
rates have been reduced to almost zero with the aim of supporting an ailing
company. Nor does the figure include the mounting pile of bad loans at
affiliates for which the parent bank will be ultimately responsible.
But the announcements, and the average 70 per cent increase in loan loss
reserves do reflect the confidence of the banking industry that property
prices will rise again, and the burden will be alleviated without the drama
of red ink on the profit statement.
The banks wrote off a total of Y172.8bn, an increase of 478 per cent on a
year earlier, and announced losses of Y153.8bn on sales to the Co-operative
Credit Purchasing Company, the banks' self-help loan buying organisation set
up in January 1993. The figures are impressive when compared to the past
modest write-offs, but not in comparison to the non-performing loan total,
estimated to be somewhere between Y20,000bn and Y30,000bn.
The earnings announcements yesterday, if nothing else, indicated the
willingness of Japanese financial authorities to give banks the necessary
time to nurse their problem loans, although a restrictive definition of bad
loans by the National Tax Agency provides no incentive for them to write
them off.
There are calls for change. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor,
recently urged institutions to 'escape from the conventional management
stance of doing the same as its competitors'. However, by not taking a
larger hit yesterday, the banks showed they are still moving in convoy.
The industry wants to keep in step, believing that if one bank announced a
loss or if the distinction between the strong and weak became too obvious,
public confidence in the more vulnerable institutions would be undermined.
As one bank said yesterday: 'This is not the US and we are definitely not
going to report losses.'
Banks were able to increase loan loss provisions because of higher business
profits, but the favourable spreads created by the fall in interest rates
during the year are evaporating and the banks will have to work harder to
increase profits this year.
There is also the possibility of another fall in stock prices, which would
create appraisal losses on their securities holdings.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at US investment bank Salomon Brothers in Tokyo,
said loan margins were beginning to narrow, but the banks still had capacity
to absorb loan losses. She also suggested the improvement in capital
adequacy ratios over the year should enable them to increase lending, if
demand from corporate Japan recovers.
Sumitomo Bank, which took the largest hit during the year because of links
to Itoman, the dissolved trading house, said its fresh loan loss reserves
are a 'forward thinking voluntary transfer'. It wrote off Y104.3bn and made
provisions of Y97.8bn.
Sumitomo explained the liberalisation of interest rates, stagnation of the
domestic economy, and a delayed recovery in property prices would affect
earnings this year, though it still forecast a doubling of pre-tax profit
and a tripling of net profit.
The 11 banks generally profited from their dealings in the bond market,
which produced an Y18.6bn profit for Sumitomo, an increase of almost 60 per
cent on the previous year. Fuji Bank was second on the bond earnings ladder
with Y17.7bn, while Sanwa Bank earned Y17.4bn.
While the banks were unruffled yesterday in delivering the earnings reports,
a sign of official concern at the health of the banking system came earlier
this week with the announcement of the liquidations of a
financially-troubled credit association, Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, caught out
by recession and loose lending.
The government was apparently unable to find one institution willing to take
over all of Kamaishi's assets, so it will be divided up among several banks
in northern Japan.
And, for the first time in Japan, funds from the Deposit Insurance
Corporation, which insures individual deposits for up to Y10m, will be used
in a liquidation.

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Materials, a leading Japanese metal and ceramics company,
suffered a 51.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y9.8bn (Dollars 90m)
last year because of waning domestic demand for fabricated metal products
and appreciation of the yen against the dollar.
Net profits plunged by about 90 per cent to Y3bn on sales of Y743.2bn, down
5.6 per cent.
The company's earnings were hit last year by lower prices of some metals in
spite of efforts to cut costs and restructure operations.
Its shares, which trade on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange,
retreated Y17 to Y511 yesterday.
The company predicts pre-tax profits of Y8bn for the current financial year
ending March 1994 on sales of Y730bn.

MINOLTA Camera, a leading Japanese precision instrument maker, saw pre-tax
profit decline by about 38 per cent to Y13.6bn (Dollars 125m) for the fiscal
year ended March. It blamed patent dispute payments with US-based Honeywell,
weak domestic demand and appraisal losses on inventories.
Net profits plunged by about 76 per cent to Y6bn last year on sales of
Y196.3bn, down 8.9 per cent. Minolta will pass bonus payments to board
directors and annual dividend payments to shareholders. It estimates pre-tax
profits at Y2.5bn on maintained sales for the current year.
Kubota, the farm equipment group, unveiled a pre-tax profits decline of 5.4
per cent to Y30bn last year, a second consecutive drop, due to the economic
downturn and global currency changes.
Net profits fell by 13.1 per cent to Y16bn, while sales rose 2.7 per cent to
Y748.5bn. The company set aside Y2.4bn in loss reserves for overseas
investment in an effort to hedge against rapid foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. Kubota expects similar pre-tax and net profits for the current
year on sales of Y760bn.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hitachi and Toshiba suffer steep
falls in earnings for year

<TEXT>
TWO of Japan's large, comprehensive electronics groups yesterday reported
steep falls in profits for the year to end-March as they faced persistent
weakness in the domestic market, falling prices and a higher yen.
Hitachi and Toshiba both revealed a sharp deterioration in their business
performance for the third year running as Japanese corporate and consumer
spending remained sluggish throughout the year.
Hitachi unveiled a 40 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y78.1bn
(Dollars 719m) from a previous Y130.8bn as it was hit by fierce price
competition in the computer market and depressed demand for its consumer
electronic products.
Non-consolidated sales fell 3 per cent to Y3,811bn while consolidated sales
also dropped 3 per cent to Y7,536bn. Group pre-tax profits slid 37 per cent
to Y234.7bn.
Hitachi, one of Japan's leading mainframe computer manufacturers, was also
affected by the downturn in mainframe demand, particularly in overseas
markets.
Consumer products suffered from a lack of demand, particularly for
audio-visual products and air conditioners, and sales fell 20 per cent.
On the bright side, the fall in Hitachi's electronics operations was
countered by strength in its power systems division, which reported an 18
per cent rise on the back of strong demand from electric power companies.
Toshiba suffered a 22 fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y54.8bn.
Firm demand from overseas for information and communications equipment and
electronic devices was offset by a depressed Japanese market.
In the personal computer market, Toshiba reported strong demand from
overseas and PC exports rose 15 per cent. However, this was offset by a 15
per cent fall on the domestic market which went through a period of turmoil
following the launch of low-priced PCs by US groups.
Consumer products fell 13 per cent largely as a result of a 35 per cent drop
in sales of air conditioners which were affected by Japan's cool summer.
Buoyant demand was seen in heavy electricals where sales increased 11 per
cent, largely on demand from electric power companies and from a railway
company.
Toshiba was optimistic about the outlook for the current year. The expected
gradual recovery of the Japanese economy this year, helped by the
government's economic stimulus package, and the growth in PC and
semiconductor demand, supported its forecast of a 5 per cent increase in
parent sales to Y3,300bn.
It expects flat pre-tax profits but a 26 per cent rise in net profits to
Y32bn.

slips into the red

<TEXT>
STATE Bank of New South Wales, the Australian public sector regional bank,
has fallen into the red in the first half to the end of March after big
increases in both doubtful debt write-offs and abnormal losses.
After abnormals, the bank turned a ADollars 10.6m profit into an ADollars
89.6m (USDollars 62.4m) loss. This reflected a ADollars 95.9m abnormal loss
mainly resulting from changed tax treatment.
Before abnormals and tax, the bank turned an ADollars 15.5m profit into a
ADollars 20.3m loss following a 46 per cent rise in doubtful debt charges to
ADollars 109.8m. A tax credit of ADollars 26.6m put the bank ADollars 6.3m
in the black before abnormals. Net non-accrual loans eased from ADollars
779.2m to ADollars 705.2m.
On Wednesday, the bank, which is preparing for privatisation, resolved its
exposure to FM Australia, the troubled entertainment group, through a sale
to Village Roadshow.
The sale, for about ADollars 93m, requires approval from the Foreign
Investment Review Board, because Village Roadshow is owned 17.5 per cent by
Anglo Television of the UK.
Lend Lease Corporation, the Australian financial services group, has
announced plans to raise between USDollars 175m and USDollars 200m through
an issue of convertible bonds as part of the finance for its acquisition of
a 15 per cent interest in Westpac, the Australian bank.

<TEXT>
THE TIGHTENING of Japanese corporate purse strings dealt a heavy blow to the
country's airlines.
Japan Airlines (Jal), the national flag carrier, fell into the red and All
Nippon Airways (ANA), the second largest airline in Japan, reported sharply
lower profits in the year to the end of March.
As expected, Jal suffered a Y53.8bn (Dollars 495m) pre-tax loss and passed
its dividend. Sales were down 7 per cent to Y1,033bn.
The carrier, which was privatised in 1987, blamed the downturn in corporate
and consumer spending and excessive price competition on international
routes for its disappointing results and warned that recovery would be slow.
The economic slowdown in Japan affected international flights both for
passengers and cargo with demand for first and business class particularly
hit. Business class travel was down 16 per cent while first class travel
fell 18 per cent during the period.
Jal has implemented a wide-ranging restructuring programme which aims to cut
costs substantially over the next few years. Hiring of cabin staff this year
has been postponed while employee benefits are under review.
It has also closed some unprofitable routes. Jal is aiming to reduce its
dependence on international routes, on which it relies for more than 50 per
cent of its revenues, and work towards building at least a 30 per cent share
of the domestic market.
Pre-tax profits at ANA, meanwhile, fell by 34 per cent to Y13.3bn hit by the
fall in business and first class travel and high costs due to an expansion
programme.
The fall in ANA's profits came despite a 1.2 per cent increase in operating
revenues to Y808.4bn. Passengers carried on international routes rose 7 per
cent.
In the current year, Jal aims to raise turnover to Y1,064bn and break even
at the pre-tax level. It is forecasting net profits of Y4bn.
ANA forecasts parent operating revenues will rise 1.7 per cent to Y822bn and
net profits will increase 7 per cent to Y2.6bn.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air offers employees
30% stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the debt-laden US carrier which plans to integrate its
operations with those of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, is proposing to give
employees a 30 per cent stake in the airline and three of the 15 board
seats. The package is in return for almost Dollars 900m in pay concessions
spread over three years.
The carrier, the fourth largest in the US, had announced an agreement in
principle with two main unions - the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
representing its flight attendants, and the International Association of
Machinists - but did not spell out details until yesterday. The
equity-for-concessions deal, however, still requires the support of other
unions at Northwest - most notably, the airline's pilots.
Northwest said negotiations with other labour groups were continuing.
Northwest's general counsel, Mr Ben Hirst, said the carrier hoped the labour
concessions would convince its banks to reschedule loan repayments. It seeks
a significant reduction in payments falling due in the next few years.
At present, Northwest has Dollars 1.015bn of payments due next year, Dollars
504m in 1995, and Dollars 519m in 1996. It is asking to cut that to Dollars
120m, Dollars 175m and Dollars 205m respectively. Proposals to the lenders
will go today.

TORONTO-Dominion Bank yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in
second-quarter earnings. However, it cautioned that performance continued to
be impeded by high non-performing loans, loan-loss provisions and losses on
investment securities.
Earnings totalled CDollars 90m (USDollars 70.8m), or 27 cents a share, in
the quarter to April 30, up from CDollars 79m, or 24 cents, a year earlier.
Return on shareholders' equity rose to 7.5 per cent from 6.3 per cent, but
return on assets slipped to 0.45 per cent from 0.47 per cent.
Total assets grew to CDollars 82.6bn on April 30 from CDollars 70.1bn.
Loan-loss provisions were CDollars 150m, unchanged from the previous
quarter. But non-performing loans on April 30, at CDollars 1.57bn, were
CDollars 134m lower, thanks to improvements in its US and European
portfolios.
Montreal-based National Bank of Canada's second-quarter earnings rose to
CDollars 40.1m, or 23 cents, from CDollars 29.8m, or 16 cents, a year
earlier.
The latest figure includes a CDollars 23m gain from the sale of leasing
operations.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley unveils sharp
rise for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Morgan Stanley rose yesterday after the big Wall Street securities
house reported a sharp improvement in first-quarter profits, to Dollars
195.8m. At the same stage last year, the company earned Dollars 139.1m.
The impressive performance was driven by strong contributions from all of
Morgan Stanley's main operations, which have thrived during the two-year
boom in Wall Street's securities underwriting, broking and trading
businesses.
Investment banking revenues were particularly buoyant, rising 40 per cent in
the quarter, to Dollars 378.8m, after strong growth in high-yield and
structured-debt underwriting volume and the equity new issues calendar. In
the past year, Morgan Stanley ranked as Wall Street's third-biggest
underwriter of stock and fourth-biggest underwriter of bonds.
Propriety trading revenues rose 27 per cent to Dollars 369.8m. The company
said big increases in fixed-income and currency trading offset a decline in
revenues from trading Japanese equity derivatives.
Elsewhere, commission revenues rose 20 per cent to Dollars 91.5m, and asset
management revenues climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 52.8m. Morgan Stanley's
costs rose sharply in the quarter, primarily because of higher
performance-related compensation payments. Total non-interest expenses rose
26 per cent to Dollars 732.5m.
Its earnings would have looked even better but for a Dollars 29m pre-tax
charge to cover the pending sale of Sweetheart Holdings, the disposable food
service products manufacturer which Morgan Stanley's leveraged equity fund
acquired in 1990.
The strong earnings, and news of the Sweetheart disposal, lifted Morgan
Stanley's shares Dollars 2 3/4 higher to Dollars 66 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the California-based oil company, yesterday announced a substantial
reshaping of its US downstream oil business. It will involve the sale of two
refineries and service stations in several states east of the Rocky
Mountains.
It will take a Dollars 550m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings
to cover losses on the sale of fixed assets and inventories, and provisions
for environmental site assessment and redundancies.
The company said its new refining and marketing organisation would
concentrate on resources in the west, south-west and south.
Mr Dave Hoyer, president of its US products business, said increasing
regulation, mandated capital spending and rising taxes imposed 'enormous
added risks and burdens' on a refining and marketing business as large as
Chevron's.
The plan involves selling refineries in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Port
Arthur, Texas.
The company will also concentrate on investing in its service stations east
of the Rockies.

Nabisco

<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the US food and tobacco group, in a surprise move last night
named Mr Charles Harper as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Harper, who is currently chairman of ConAgra and has been credited with
turning that company from a commodities business into a successful packaged
food products group, will take up his new post on Monday.
Only two months ago, RJR Nabisco acted speedily to fill the chairman's post
when Mr Lou Gerstner left to run IBM. RJR set up a 'co-chairman' structure,
splitting the job between Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, formerly its general
counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director.
In March, RJR gave no hint that it would be looking for a new, sole
chairman. Indeed, Mr Ricciardi stressed the arrangement was not an 'interim
step'. Last night, the company said that at that stage, 'frankly there were
no plans to change the structure'. However, it also denied there had been
any disagreements between the co-chairmen.
It said Mr Harper's appointment would help the company 'aggressively pursue
its growth agenda under Mike Harper's leadership as a highly experienced
chief executive with a strong background in consumer products'.
Under the new arrangement, Mr Ricciardi will become president and Mr von der
Heyden will retire.
Mr Harper, 64, retired as chief executive of ConAgra last year, although he
stayed on as chairman, guiding group strategy. He has worked for ConAgra
since 1974.
The appointment of a well-respected executive with long experience of the
food industry comes at a sensitive time for RJR. Its shares have languished,
creating unhappiness among some investors and problems for Kolhbery, Kravis
Roberts, the company's largest shareholder.

<TEXT>
WALL Street investment bank Lehman Brothers announced yesterday that Mr
Howard Clark Jr, its former chairman, would return to the company as
vice-chairman. He will be given special responsibility for handling and
developing corporate client relationships worldwide.
Mr Clark, 49, ran Shearson Lehman Brothers between 1990 and 1993, but was
ousted in February when Mr James Robinson, head of the firm's parent,
American Express, replaced him as chairman.
Soon after, however, Mr Robinson was forced out at American Express, and the
firm's Shearson retail brokerage and asset management operation was sold to
Primerica for more than Dollars 1bn.
Mr Clark's appointment came as something of a surprise to industry
observers, who had expected the former Shearson head to join one of the
several big Wall Street investment banking firms which had approached him
after his departure from Shearson in March.
Although Mr Clark was an experienced investment banker, Shearson struggled
during his tenure as chairman, making meagre profits or large losses at a
time when the securities industry was recoverying from the lean years of the
late 1980s.

R. H. Macy, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, plans
additional cost-cutting measures as part of a revised, five-year business
plan.
It said yesterday it had toned down its projections for growth in sales and
gross margins because of 'continuing sluggishness in the economy and
competitive pressures'.
It released details of its first business plan in November, when some
retailers were optimistic about the sector.
Macy said it would cut jobs by about 11 per cent more than anticipated in
the original plan, and was attempting to reduce spending on advertising to
focus on 'target' customers.
It also envisages a new health care programme, which should save more than
Dollars 37m in fiscal 1994 and Dollars 57m in 1995.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Time Warner, the US media group, fell yesterday morning despite an
announcement late on Wednesday that Seagram, the Canadian drinks group, had
spent some Dollars 700m to acquire a 5.7 per cent stake in the company
'solely for purposes of investment'.
Seagram, in filings with US regulators, sought approval to buy up to 15 per
cent of Time Warner's outstanding shares.
The news came after the New York Stock Exchange closed on Wednesday, and had
been widely expected to boost Time Warner's price, which fell instead on
profit-making. At lunchtime, it was quoted at Dollars 37, down Dollars 1.
Some analysts tracking the mysterious buying of Time Warner stock said the
identification of Seagram as the purchaser was anti-climactic, since it
seemed an unlikely bidder for the company.
The 21.12m shares so far acquired were bought in a series of open-market
purchases from February 2.
Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram chairman, said he believed media and
entertainment was one of the great growth sectors for the 1990s. Time Warner
was the company best positioned to benefit from growth in the field, he
said.

TORONTO Dominion Bank yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in
second-quarter earnings. However, it cautioned that performance continued to
be impeded by high non-performing loans, loan-loss provisions and losses on
investment securities.
Earnings totalled CDollars 90m (USDollars 70.8m), or 27 cents a share, in
the quarter to April 30, up from CDollars 79m, or 24 cents, a year earlier.
Return on shareholders' equity rose to 7.5 per cent from 6.3 per cent, but
return on assets slipped to 0.45 per cent from 0.47 per cent.
Total assets grew to CDollars 82.6bn on April 30 from CDollars 70.1bn,
largely because of the acquisition this year of Central Guaranty, an ailing
trust company.
Loan-loss provisions were CDollars 150m, unchanged from the previous
quarter. However, non-performing loans on April 30, at CDollars 1.57bn, were
CDollars 134m lower, thanks to improvements in its US and European
portfolios.
The bank, Canada's fifth largest, said the Central Guaranty acquisition
'continued to contribute positively' to earnings.
Montreal-based National Bank of Canada's second-quarter earnings rose to
CDollars 40.1m, or 23 cents, from CDollars 29.8m, or 16 cents, a year
earlier.
The latest figure includes a CDollars 23m gain from the sale of leasing
operations.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fresh sources to fund recovery -
The French government is breaking new ground with its latest bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been dubbed the 'Feel-Good Bond', the 'Balladur Bond' and the
'Recovery Bond' by government debt specialists.
The new FFr40bn French government bond issue - announced earlier this week
by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister - is specifically intended
to finance Mr Balladur's economic recovery programme.
It has already attracted considerable interest among bond analysts: many are
wondering what impact it will have on the French bond market, one of the
European debt markets most closely watched by overseas investors.
The government will employ two innovative features to attract individual
investors: convertibility into shares in forthcoming privatisations and the
right to hold the bonds in tax-exempt savings plans.
Analysts point out the government is tapping a new source of money with this
latest initiative. Private investors are expected to switch their savings
out of money market funds, where a recent fall in interest rates has meant a
decline in return.
In addition, traditional share investors may be wooed into buying the bonds,
given they may convert them into new privatisation stocks.
'The government is trying to take advantage of the fact that interest rates
are coming down. It will be standing there with a bucket to catch some of
the FFr1,200bn currently held in the Sicav (money market funds) as the money
comes out,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland
Global Markets.
Mr Steve Major, European bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais, predicts that by
targetting these investors, the new bond is unlikely to spark a sharp switch
out of existing government debt. As a result, bond prices - notably in the
four-year area where the new issue will be launched - should not weaken
dramatically.
He says that while the new bond would have the same credit rating as
existing French debt issues, it might even trade at a slight premium to
current issues because of the conversion and tax advantages.
However, other bond experts say it is not clear yet whether the new issue
will be particularly liquid. 'If private investors decide to hold on to the
bonds (until conversion), they would be very illiquid,' says Mr George
Magnus. of SG Warburg Securities. He says it is still unclear whether the
French houses will be asked to make markets in the new issue.
The prospect of a further FFr40bn of new supply - on top of the government's
forecast of total OAT (bond) and BTAN (note) issuance of FFr480bn for 1993 -
has not upset the French bond market. As Ms Thomsen says: 'The new bond is
equivalent in size to one regular monthly bond auction.'
Ten-year French government bond yields have fallen from 9.2 per cent last
July to a low of 7.04 per cent in April, and the spread over comparable
German bonds has narrowed dramatically. French interest rates have been cut
steadily since the March general election but, like other members of the
European exchange rate mechanism, France may now have to wait for the
Bundesbank to cut rates.
Mr Magnus points out the Bank of France is unlikely to have scope to cut
rates again unless there is a strong move in the franc.
'The market still has fresh memories of unilateral rate cuts (by the Bank of
France) which were too fast and had to be reversed,' he says.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chevron reshapes businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEVRON, the California-based oil company, yesterday announced a substantial
reshaping of its US downstream oil business. It will involve the sale of two
refineries and service stations in several states east of the Rocky
Mountains.
It will take a Dollars 550m after-tax charge against second-quarter earnings
to cover losses on the sale of fixed assets and inventories, and provisions
for environmental site assessment and redundancies.
The company said its new refining and marketing organisation would
concentrate on resources in the west, south-west and south.
Mr Dave Hoyer, president of its US products business, said increasing
regulation, mandated capital spending and rising taxes imposed 'enormous
added risks and burdens' on a refining and marketing business as large as
Chevron's.
The company also saw slow growth in future demand. Capital investment
demands were escalating dramatically because of requirements of the Clean
Air Act.
The plan involves selling Chevron's refineries at Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, and Port Arthur, Texas.
It explained it no longer mar-keted fuel products in the north-east, where
Philadelphia is situated, while Port Arthur represented more refining
capacity than it needed in the Gulf Coast market.
The company will also concentrate on investing in its service stations east
of the Rockies: in six Gulf Coast states, where it has competitive
strengths; Florida; Georgia; Alabama; Mississippi; Louisiana and Texas.
It will sell service stations to Chevron-branded wholesalers in other states
east of the Rockies, including North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland
and Ohio.

L4,809bn

<TEXT>
IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has run up a loss of L4,809bn
(Dollars 3.23bn) for 1992. It is believed to be the worst ever result in
Italian corporate history.
The figure, which compares with a L343bn loss in 1991, stems from losses at
the Ilva steel and Iritecna building and engineering units.
The results were also depressed by losses at Alitalia, the state airline,
and at the Fincantieri shipbuilding group. IRI controls two of Italy's
biggest banks and the Stet telecoms concern.
Last year Ilva lost more than L2,300bn and Iritecna is expected to report a
loss of about L1,600bn. The group also blamed high interest charges: its
debt now exceeds L73,000bn.
Restructuring plans have been prepared for both Ilva and Iritecna but these
have still to be implemented. Ilva itself is forecasting a loss of about
L1,700bn this year.
IRI also blamed the government's failure to pay L7,200bn in grants allocated
in 1991 but not received due to legal changes.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks increase loan
provisions by 70%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese banks yesterday increased their provisions for bad loans by
an average 70 per cent for the year ended March, but made it clear that it
will take them several years to clear away the financial debris from the
lending excesses of the late 1980s.
For the first time, the 11 leading commercial banks, known as city banks in
Japan, announced non-performing loan estimates, ranging from 1.58 per cent
of outstanding loans at Mitsubishi Bank to 4.8 per cent at Hokkaido
Takushoku Bank, and that they have a collective Y8,435.1bn (Dollars 77.67bn)
in problem loans.
However, the amounts do not reflect all the damage done by the domestic
property market collapse, while a 478 per cent year-on-year increase in
write-offs indicates more the low level of previous write-offs than a push
to fully account for problem lending.
Pre-tax profits fell by an average 32.4 per cent, the fourth year of
decline, although a fall in interest rates, a widening of lending spreads,
and a revived bond market enabled the 11 banks to record an average 30.9 per
cent increase in business profits.
The banks' reluctance to write off their bad debts is likely to be matched
by a hesitance to lend in the next few years, meaning that international
companies will face more difficulty in securing Japanese funds and that the
recovery of the domestic economy could be hindered.
Sumitomo Bank, entangled in the collapse of the trading house Itoman, was
the most aggressive in providing for non-performing loans, writing off
Y104.3bn and providing Y97.8bn in fresh reserves, behind an 87.2 per cent
plunge in net profit. Sumitomo, usually the most profitable Japanese
institution, fell to tenth on the net earnings ladder.
But all 11 were able to celebrate capital adequacy ratios comfortably above
the 8 per cent threshold as defined by the Bank for International
Settlements. The ratios of capital to assets ranged from 8.96 per cent at
Sakura Bank to 9.61 per cent at the Bank of Tokyo, after most institutions
took on subordinated debt and trim-med assets to bolster ratios.
Apart from increasing their provisions, bank profits were hit by appraisal
losses on securities holdings, which would have been greater but for a surge
in stock prices in the final weeks of the year.
The banks admit that the favourable conditions from falling interest rates
are passing, and with non-performing loans likely to rise, they will have
difficulty in making provisions without pushing net profits to
embarrassingly low levels.

FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Credit Local blazes a sell-off
trail
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT is no secret that the French banking industry has had a tough time over
the past year or so, but at least one bank, Credit Local de France, has
managed to weather the storms.
At a time when other banks have suffered sharp falls in profits, or even
fallen into loss, Credit Local, a specialist in local authority loans,
managed to increase net profits by 11 per cent to FFr1.19bn (Dollars 210m)
in 1992. It has now received its reward by being named as the first
candidate for the new centre-right French government's privatisation
programme.
For the government the issue, involving the sale of a 30.5 per cent stake
worth between FFr4bn and FFr5bn, will be an important test of the Paris
stock market's appetite for privatisation stock.
But for Credit Local itself, according to Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, the
sale will mark the start of a new era of 'maturity'.
Credit Local is a relatively new phenomenon. It traces its roots to 1987
when, following the reform of France's local authority finances, the old
Caisse d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales was spun off into an
independent entity and rechristened Credit Local de France.
The new company started life with the state as its majority shareholder,
through a direct 47.5 per cent stake and the 25 per cent belonging to Caisse
des Depots, the public sector funding institution. But in 1991 Credit Local
went public as first participant in the socialist government's partial
privatisation programme with the FFr2.4bn sale of a 25 per cent holding.
Credit Local has since fared well both on the stock market and in its own
activities. French local authority finances have been fraught with problems
in recent years as a number of cities have counted the cost of their
over-ambitious expansion in the late 1980s.
But Credit Local, which financed much of that expansion, has flourished.
Last year's increase in net profits was accompanied by a 10 per cent
increase in net banking income to FFr2.8bn in 1992 from FFr2.6bn in 1991 and
a 12 per cent rise in net assets to FFr320bn from FFr285bn.
The group has also also accelerated its international expansion by adding a
51 per cent interest in CLF Municipal Bank, a local authority loans
specialist in London, and a new subsidiary in Madrid to its existing
businesses in Brussels, Vienna and New York.
Mr Richard hopes to continue this international drive with the aim of
increasing the proportion of credit activities outside France from 10 per
cent this year to 15 per cent by 1995.
But neither this expansion plan, nor the forthcoming share sale, signals a
significant switch in Credit Local's own strategy. Mr Richard said yesterday
that the bank plans to 'carry on doing exactly the same job, but in greater
depth'.

<TEXT>
KOLBENSCHMIDT, the car components arm of the Metallgesellschaft industrial
group, made a loss of DM33.4m (Dollars 20.46m) in the six months to the end
of March.
This was more than double the loss of DM14.7m in the first half of 1991-92,
but was a considerable improvement on the DM73.9m loss made in the six
months to the end of September.
The company said conditions for suppliers to the motor industry had worsened
in the period. At the parent company, sales dropped 11.4 per cent to
DM311.1m over the six months.
But Kolbenschmidt said that if the results were measured against the second
half of last year, a gradual change in the company's fortunes was
noticeable, reflecting rationalisation measures designed to restore
profitability.
Kolbenschmidt predicted that against a gloomy economic background, it would
take until the next financial year for the rationalisation measures to have
a substantial effect on profitability.
Volkswagen, Europe's leading vehicle manufacturer, sold 1.08m cars worldwide
in the first four months of the year, the company said yesterday, 11.7 per
cent less than in the same period last year.
In Germany the number of vehicles sold fell 22.4 per cent to 358,200; in
western Europe as a whole VW sold 747,000 cars, 19 per cent down.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Quadrant ends year Pounds 7.26m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'1992-93 was a bad year for Quadrant,' Lord Rees, chairman of the
photographic and video equipment company, said yesterday as he reported
doubled attributable losses of Pounds 16.2m, against Pounds 8.44m
previously.
At the pre-tax level the year to February 28 suffered losses of Pounds 7.27m
(1.41m profit).
In Quadrant's continuing activities, operating losses grew to Pounds 2.6m
(Pounds 800,000) on turnover of Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 45.4m). Lord Rees
ascribed this to 'the internal upheavals within the group,' and 'the deep
recession in the UK economy.' The video systems and processing businesses
were particularly badly affected.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 10.5m) included a Pounds 8.2m
write-down of the company's two liquid petroleum gas ships. They were
acquired in 1991 from a company controlled by Mr Robert Brothers, Lord Rees'
predecessor.
Mr David Coghlan, who became chief executive in December after he and Mr
Jean-Marc Cangardel, his partner, bought a 25 per cent stake for Pounds
1.2m, said his first action had been to dismantle the nascent internal
merger between the two divisions and Leeds Photovisual and Imagesenter.
The merger contributed Pounds 2.11m to exceptional charges of Pounds 3.3m
(Pounds 307,000), and its Pounds 101,000 dismantling costs swelled the
extraordinaries.
No dividend is proposed. In 1991-92, a total dividend of 4p was paid,
including a final of 2.35p.
Losses per share were 25.96p (6.87p earnings).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reorganisation costs and lower interest received left pre-tax profits at Mid
Kent Holdings, the water company, down 14 per cent at Pounds 6.17m for the
year to March 31, against Pounds 7.21m.
Turnover was higher at Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 29.1m). The pre-tax figure was
struck after reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.06m) and net
interest received of Pounds 399,000 (Pounds 1.15m).
Earnings per share were 26.5p (31.7p) and a proposed final dividend of 5.75p
makes a total of 10.5p (9.5p).
Mr Jeremy Leigh Pemberton, chairman, said the company was still coping with
the effects of the recession and drought.
There were problems meeting expected demand while respecting the environment
and the options were becoming more complex and getting a higher social and
political profile.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon to raise Pounds 6.4m for
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ITS interim figures, which show an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, Davenport Vernon is calling for Pounds 6.4m net to continue its
expansion and reduce gearing.
Shareholders in this multi-franchised motor dealer are offered 5.36m shares
on a 2-for-5 basis at 125p each. Yesterday the shares fell 5p to 142p.
Mr Ralph Denne, chairman, said the group had expanded rapidly since the
beginning of 1992 and now operated from 22 dealerships. The new operations
were progressing well.
There had been 'particularly encouraging' results from two of the three
Nissan outlets. There were still opportunities to make additional
acquisitions at good value and a number of proposals were being reviewed, he
said.
For the six months ended March 31 1993 turnover rose from Pounds 50.7m to
Pounds 69.5m, to which acquisition and new developments contributed Pounds
2.48m (Pounds 540,000). Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 895,000 (Pounds
805,000).
Mr Denne said new car sales rose by 29.7 per cent, with existing businesses
accounting for 17 per cent of that. Improvement in earnings also came from
used cars and generally better operating standards.
Earnings per share worked through at 4.4p (4.1p) and the interim dividend is
again 1.5p.
At March 31 borrowings were Pounds 11.9m, excluding new vehicle stocking
finance, for gearing of 56 per cent.
Directors and certain other shareholders are selling their rights to
subscribe for 53.7 per cent of the issue. NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the
underwriter, will find institutional placees for them.

market is expected to present its conclusions this autumn.
Following yesterday's initial meeting of the committee's 17 members, it
appears increasingly likely that some form of defined market for younger
companies will be recommended. It is also thought that the body is broadly
in favour of running a market under the aegis of the Stock Exchange.
Mr Ian Macpherson, Stock Exchange board member and chairman of the working
party, said sub-committees had been formed to examine foreign markets and
the legal implications of any changes and were expected to report back in
about a month.
The final meeting in September would be able to present 'some pretty
reasonable reportable conclusions.'
The working party would investigate the areas and composition of demand for
a junior market as well as examine legislative obstacles to a less regulated
environment.
Referring to the complaint that the regulatory environment imposed
disproportionately heavy costs on smaller companies, Mr Macpherson said:
'There must be a simpler route.'
However, any conclusion would have to balance the need to 'provide the
legendary Aunt Agatha with risk assessment information and at the same time
allow companies to come to the market-place.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Thorntons to restructure French business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DETERIORATING French economy has forced Thorntons, the chocolate maker
and retailer, to restructure its French business which is expected to make a
loss of Pounds 1.8m for the year ending June 26.
In March, Thorntons said it hoped that losses from its subsidiary might be
less than the previous year's Pounds 750,000 deficit.
Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, whose family owns 48 per
cent of the shares, said losses had been far worse than anticipated because
of the severity of the downturn in France.
The company is to dispose of 25 of its 60 sites and has appointed Mr John
Coyle, a main board director, as managing director for European operations.
As a result of this, the company is anticipating an exceptional charge of up
to Pounds 7.75m.
In addition, Pounds 2.5m previously written off directly to reserves at the
time of the acquisition of the French subsidiary at the end of 1989 will
also be charged to the profit and loss account.
Last year the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.2m. Mr Thornton said
that while the restructuring would adversely affect this year's profits, he
had decided that it was better 'to face up to the problem now than let it
get worse'.
Sales in France for the half year to January 9 rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds
4.6m). Interest payments increased to Pounds 650,000 (Pounds 478,000) with
net borrowings at the half year of Pounds 4.8m.
The group has suffered because of relatively high French interest rates.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Smart shares hit by profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in J Smart (Contractors) were marked down 15p to 205p yesterday as
the company warned of a substantial reduction in profit for the year ending
July 31 1993.
Although the volume of work in hand in contracting was markedly up on last
year, margins had been further eroded and were now at an all-time low, the
directors said.
They reported a drop from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 1.04m in pre-tax profit for
the opening half, and did not expect the figure for the current six months
to be substantially different.
Turnover fell 17 per cent to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 7.1m) in the six months
ended January 31, and for the year was not expected to match last time's
Pounds 14m.
Earnings came to 6.91p (10.5p). The interim dividend is held at 2.3p, again
costing Pounds 116,000 as shareholders owning some 50 per cent of the
capital waived their rights.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SW Water rises 3% to Pounds 93m - Heavy
spending programme offsets higher operating profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH West Water yesterday announced a 3 per cent profits increase, in line
with expectations.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, described the 12 months to March 31 as 'an
excellent year' and said South West's heavy spending programme, which
includes cleaning up 81 beaches, remained on track.
Annual pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 92.7m (Pounds 90m). At the
interim stage, profits were 3.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 48.9m.
Higher operating profits, stemming from price increases, were offset by
falling interest income as the net cash position deteriorated in line with
the heavy capital investment.
Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 194m (Pounds 167m), mainly
helped by average price rises of 17 per cent.
Because of the improvements needed in its area, South West has the highest
agreed price increases with Ofwat, the water regulator, of inflation plus
11.5 per cent.
Operating profits increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 64.2m),
helped by cost cutting and a divisional restructuring. Staff numbers fell by
about 100 to just under 3,000. There were redundancy costs of Pounds 2.4m
and bad debt amounting to Pounds 1.1m was written off.
South West's non-regulated business, which includes Haul-Waste, purchased in
February from English China Clays, contributed turnover of Pounds 10.3m and
was slightly loss-making after interest.
The company also announc-ed the Pounds 14.9m acquisition of Testlink
Holdings, a manufacturer of environmental monitoring equipment.
Capital expenditure in the period under review increased by 18 per cent to
Pounds 203.7m. The company went from net cash of Pounds 150m to net
borrowings of Pounds 14m.
Interest receivable declined from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 11.9m.
Earnings increased to 67.9p (66.1p). The company recommended a final
dividend of 15.9p (14.6p) to make an increased total of 23.7p (21.7p).
The share price closed 6p down at 514p.
COMMENT
This should be a revealing year for South West. Its cash pile is exhausted
and last year's interest income will be replaced by an interest charge.
Meanwhile, its non-core activities are set to grow rapidly at the sales
level, thanks to the acquisitions, although their post-interest contribution
will be under scrutiny. Overall, pre-tax profits will show a similar
increase to last year. Despite dull profits growth, South West has the
advantage of having renegotiated a price increase with the regulator
already, when it agreed a 'cost pass-through' in 1991. The agreed increases
are not sacrosanct after 1995, but they are less at risk of regulatory
rigour than some water companies. However, given that the whole sector is
under the lengthening shadow of regulatory worries ahead of Ofwat's 1994
interim review, South West is likely to drift with its peers.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon pays Dollars 88m for bank cheque
printer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing company, is
expanding its US printing activities by buying Checks in the Mail, a printer
of bank cheques sold directly to customers through the post, for Dollars 88m
(Pounds 56m).
It is the first purchase by Caradon since it sold its 25.3 per cent stake in
CarnaudMetalbox (CMB) for Pounds 473m, leaving it with net cash of Pounds
428m.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said the market should not infer that the
takeover meant the group was looking at completing a series of small bolt-on
acquisitions.
'A big deal is still what we would like to do; I am not as pessimistic as
some that big acquisitions are unattainable,' he added.
Checks in the Mail is being purchased from Rexham, the US subsidiary of
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group.
The net assets of Checks in the Mail at the end of 1992 were Dollars 5m and
net profits were Dollars 3.8m on sales of Dollars 38.7m.
Caradon's US printing activities generates revenue of almost Dollars 300m
accounting for 15 per cent of the US cheque printing industry.
The business of selling cheques directly to customers in the US is growing
by 12 per cent a year while the usage of cheques is rising by 1 to 2 per
cent a year.
Mr Jansen said he was effectively paying 'an entry price' to get into the
lucrative business of selling cheques directly to customers by mail.
Mr David Lyon, Bowater chief executive, said the sale would enable his
company to focus on its core industrial films and coatings, packaging and
building products.

The advance, from Pounds 899,000 to Pounds 1.58m, was achieved on lower

364,000 gain on the sale of its south coast newspapers. Turnover from
continuing operations improved from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 13.1m.
Earnings per share worked through at 6.59p (5.32p) and the dividend is

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Xtra-Vision to sell Videosmith offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Xtra-Vision, the Dublin-based video cassette rental company, yesterday
blamed a downturn in performance at Videosmith, its US offshoot, for the
fall in full year profits, and said that it intended to sell its
Boston-based subsidiary.
With turnover marginally lower at IPounds 22.7m (IPounds 22.9m) pre-tax
profits for the year ended January 31 declined from IPounds 1.68m to IPounds
1.01m, or Pounds 976,000 sterling.
Arising from the sale decision, the group had provided IPounds 4.7m as an
extraordinary item against the value of Videosmith. Discussions regarding
the sale had taken place with interested parties but there was no deal
imminent.
As an interim measure, Xtra-Vision had disposed of four under-performing
stores in New Hampshire. Videosmith continued to trade profitably and its
performance so far this year was ahead of 1992.
Extraordinary charges totalled Pounds 5.56m (Pounds 530,000) and earnings
per share fell from 1.13p to 0.55p.

JACKSON GROUP, the East Anglian construction and industrial services

That compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.55m last time and came from
turnover down from Pounds 59.5m to Pounds 57.6m. The outcome, however,
represented a downturn from the profit of Pounds 386,000 reported at the
interim stage, when exceptional income of Pounds 874,000 boosted the
results.
A same-again final dividend of 1p is proposed, making a total for the year
of 1.5p (2p).

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Apollo makes Pounds 4.9m placing as
build-up costs hit profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APOLLO METALS, the USM-quoted aluminium processor and distributor, plans to
move up to a listing with a Pounds 4.87m placing and open offer to repay
bank borrowings and invest in growth.
It has also reported, as expected, a fall in first half ended March 31
pre-tax profits from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 588,000. It was hit by the
cost of building up its new French and German operations.
Stockbrokers Griffiths and Lamb have conditionally placed 5.22m shares, and
are offering them at 101p on the basis of 2-for-5 ordinary or 2.76-for-5
preference shares. The ordinary closed down 2p at 111p. The directors will
not take up any new shares.
Placing proceeds will reduce bank borrowing to minimal levels from Pounds
5.45m now, representing gearing of more than 50 per cent.
Mr Albert Hargreaves, chairman, said the company hoped for mainly organic
growth: 'We will be sticking to the knitting.'
Turnover for the six months rose to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 12m) helped by
international sales more than trebled to Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 1.21m).
Loss-making German operations, which started trading in early 1992,
contributed sales of Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 529,000); break-even is expected
by December. It hopes to repeat the sales pattern of the UK, up slightly at
Pounds 10.8m, where during the downturn some buyers have found Apollo's
just-in-time supplies of processed aluminium more attractive.
The five-strong French sales team, operational from the end of 1991,
contributed turnover of Pounds 496,000 (Pounds 128,000) and is almost
breaking even.
Exports elsewhere rose to Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 549,000). Orders for
aerospace products were down, accounting for a third of turnover. Long-term
orders were worth a quarter of sales.
Operating costs increased to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.2m) reflecting capital
spending of Pounds 1.6m mainly in Germany and a Pounds 500,000 purchase of
materials processing equipment. Net interest payments were Pounds 183,000
(Pounds 58,000).
The interim dividend is stepped up to 1.2p (1.15p) out of earnings per share
of 3p (3.5p).

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dobson Park falls Pounds 714,000 into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOBSON PARK Industries, which recently merged its mining equipment business
with a rival to survive the UK coal crisis, fell into the red in the first
half with pre-tax losses of Pounds 714,000.
The sharp swing from profits last year of Pounds 6.2m was primarily the
result of the Pounds 4.36m book loss on the disposal of two businesses.
However, the restructuring of the mining division and uncertainty over the
future of the UK coal pits had also hit profits.
Losses per share totalled 1.12p, against earnings of 3.32p. The interim
dividend is cut from 1.9p to 1.2p. Net operating return was 39 per cent
lower at Pounds 4.1m, on sales 27 per cent down to Pounds 71.8m.
Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the group expected a much better performance
from the mining division in the second half. The business had suffered a 50
per cent drop in net operating profits to Pounds 1.5m during the six months
to April 3.
Orders were running ahead of last year, the chairman said, and the joint
venture with Meco International would easily achieve forecast turnover of
Pounds 200m in 1993.
Dobson Park, which is in the process of refocusing on its industrial
electronics and mining businesses, sold its aerospace components operation
and loss-making power tools subsidiary for a total Pounds 15m cash. Net debt
after inclusion of the power tool proceeds would be Pounds 5.7m.
Mr Kaye said the group hoped to expand the industrial electronics division
in the UK to avoid potential ACT problems. Currently about 75 per cent of
this division's sales come from overseas. Industrial electronics returned
operating profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.4m) in the first half. Toys and
plastics fell from Pounds 537,000 to Pounds 364,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the international cables and construction group, is to float its US
subsidiary, Andover Controls, on the Nasdaq National Market System.
The flotation of Andover, which makes micro-computer based building
automation systems, follows BICC's decision to concentrate on its core
businesses.
BICC is making an initial public offering of 3m shares (about 60 per cent)
of the common stock at an estimated price of between Dollars 14 and Dollars
16 per share.
Upon completion, it will retain an interest of some 33.8 per cent in Andover
(24.8 per cent if the underwriters' over allotment option is exercised in
full) and Andover employees will hold about 6.2 per cent.
Net proceeds received by Massachusetts-based Andover, estimated at Dollars
41.4m (Pounds 27m), will be used to repay intercompany indebtedness.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Speckled Hen helps Morland grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND &amp; Co, the Thames Valley-based brewer which beat off a hostile bid by
Greene King last year, announced a 29 per cent profits increase and a
trading agreement with Bass covering its fast growing Old Speckled Hen ale.
Pre-tax profits in the half-year to March 31 increased to Pounds 3.63m,
against a restated Pounds 2.82m, on turnover up 28 per cent at Pounds 24.1m
(Pounds 18.8m).
A 45 per cent rise took operating profits to Pounds 4.82m (Pounds 3.32m) but
net interest costs jumped to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 349,000) reflecting
sharply increased net borrowings of Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 8m). Gearing stands
at 26.3 per cent.
Earnings per share amounted to 11.9p (9.4p restated) and the interim
dividend is raised to 2.78p (2.42p).
The 1992 figures have been restated to comply with the FRS 3 accounting
standard.
The main change is in the treatment of exceptional items and the bid defence
costs last year. On the old basis pre-tax profits would have increased by 20
per cent from Pounds 3.06m to Pounds 3.66m and earnings from 10.5p to 12p.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman, said he was 'quite pleased' with the
results 'given the recessionary background against which they have been
achieved.'
He noted that overall sales of the group's own ales grew by 22 per cent over
the period. In particular, sales of Old Speckled Hen had risen by well over
200 per cent, and represented 20 per cent of total production.
Under the trading agreement with Bass, the UK's largest brewer, Old Speckled
Hen will be distributed to selected managed houses in the south east and
Midlands. In return Morland will stock draught Bass as a guest ale.
Morland already has trading agreements for Old Speckled hen with Whitbread,
Courage, Adnams, Charles Wells, Everards, Fullers and Marstons. Free trade
volume, including wholesalers, grew by 48 per cent.
The group's retail division increased turnover by 22 per cent, with food
sales increasingly important.
Meanwhile, the 101 pubs acquired from Courage have been integrated and are
trading well, while the 72 pubs purchased last year from Inntrepreneur
Estates made a first time contribution. Moorland's shares closed up 2p at
500p.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MAM rises 26% to more than Pounds 65m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management, Britain's largest institutional fund management
company, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
65.1m for the year ended March 31 1993.
The company, which is 75 per cent owned by investment bank SG Warburg, has
proposed a final dividend of 12p (8.9p) making a total of 15p against 11.5p.
The results include a Pounds 2.9m gain on the sale of Mercury's sale of its
stake in fund manager Jupiter Tyndall which had been written down the year
before.
Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said the improved results reflected a net
increase in funds under management of Pounds 1.9bn. Gross funds under
management rose to Pounds 49.7bn compared with Pounds 40bn, with a
significant portion of the rise reflecting the dramatic improvement in asset
values following Britain's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism last year.
While the bulk of the net inflow consist of the institutional UK pension
fund assets which have been the mainstay of Mercury's business, a
significant portion are accounts from private clients, overseas accounts and
charities.
Funds managed for international clients have risen by about 30 per cent
during 1992-93 to Pounds 9.4bn.
Mr Stevenson explained that Mercury had spent about Pounds 25m in upgrading
its systems over the past five years which has allowed it to expand funds
under management dramatically without significant expansion in staff.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cazenove replaced as fund manager by LPFA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Pensions Fund Authority, which administers the pensions of the
London borough employees, has sacked Cazenove as one of its external fund
managers because of poor performance and replaced them with Gartmore, writes
Norma Cohen.
The move is part of a growing trend among pension funds to concentrate on
four major independent fund managers, of which Gartmore is one. The others
are Mercury Asset Management, Philips and Drew Fund Management and Schroder
Asset Management and the group is estimated to manage roughly a quarter of
the entire UK pension fund market.
The LPFA, which has about Pounds 1.8bn in assets, has three external
managers overseeing pools of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 480m each. Since
1988, Cazenove, PDFM and Prudential Portfolio Managers have each managed one
of the pools. However, Cazenove has been unable to meet the performance
target recently.
Mr Peter Scales, chief executive of LPFA, said the managers were expected to
produce returns, assessed on a three-year rolling basis, of one percentage
point above the median UK pension fund pool as measured by the WM Company,
an independent performance measurement service.
Mr Scales said its short-list of contenders, besides Gartmore, were
Schroder, Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford and Baring Asset Management.
Also, LPFA has removed Bacon and Woodrow as its actuarial advisers and
retained the much smaller consultancy firm of Hymans Robertson.
Mr Scales said that while Bacon and Woodrow had provided excellent service,
the LPFA preferred a consultancy firm specialising in the local authority
market.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National Power focuses on export markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, yesterday provided details of a
management reorganisation as it unveiled a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits and raised dividends by 16 per cent.
The management shake-up is aimed at providing a sharper focus on target,
mainly export, markets. Although the senior executive complement remains
unchanged responsibilities are altering.
Mr Colin Webster has been appointed managing director of the UK operation,
Mr Granville Camsey becomes technology group managing director and Mr Rod
Jackson corporate services managing director. The two other units,
international and finance, remain with Mr Graham Hadley and Mr Brian
Birkenhead.
Executives below main board level have been given responsibility for
targeting developments in different areas of the world as National Power
attempts to fill the gap that will result from a de- clining share of the UK
market.
'Our main thrust is to make National Power a leading international power
business,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive.
In the year to March 28, National Power made pre-tax profits of Pounds 580m
(against Pounds 514m) on turnover of Pounds 4.3bn, down 8 per cent. Dividend
per share is 10.6p (against 9.1p), covered 3.1 times by earnings of 32.9p
(28.6p).
Mr Baker said dividend cover would be cut to 'more normal levels' in future
years but warned that increased domestic competition meant earnings growth
prospects were less certain. Turnover in the current year was down, he said.
Last year's profits increase was helped by a 4,000 reduction to 7,400 in
staff numbers. This led to a 25 per cent productivity improvement. Mr Baker
said the company expected to shed at least 1,000 jobs over the next two to
three years.
Mr Baker said the company has been in discussions with several 'serious
players' about selling some of its power stations.
He added that the company had considered swapping some of its stations with
electricity companies overseas, though no deal was imminent.
The company has provided a further Pounds 113m against future costs. The
main element is an increase of Pounds 150m in provisions for rationalising
and restructuring the company.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MTS close to agreeing restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARITIME Transport Services, which is developing the new Thamesport
container facility at the Isle of Grain in Kent, is close to agreeing a
financial restructuring with its banks. This follows mounting losses because
of recession and lower than expected container throughput.
MTS said its banks and shareholders had reached 'agreement in principle' for
a restructuring, which remains subject to final documentation and approval
by some lenders' head offices.
Sources involved in the restructuring said it involved converting 'a large
chunk' of Pounds 120m debts into equity. One institutional shareholder said
he expected final agreement in 'four to six weeks'.
The restructuring was triggered when MTS breached some of its banking
covenants last May and made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.5m in 1991, mainly
attributable to interest charges.
The company agreed with its banks to defer about Pounds 9.5m of interest
payments until the end of May and negotiated a Pounds 2m extension to its
overdraft facility.

SEDGWICK, the insurance broker, yesterday announced the issue of a Pounds
41.5m convertible bond. The group said it would use the proceeds for general
corporate purposes and reduce debt of some Pounds 200m.
Mr Jeremy Pinchin, the company secretary, said markets had responded
positively to the issue, much of which had been placed with European
investors by lead managers, SG Warburg Securities and NM Rothschild.
The bonds will carry a coupon of 7.25 per cent and be paid semi-annually in
arrears, with the conversion price set at 190p (15.85 per cent over the
price of Sedgwick's ordinary share price at the time of the pricing).
Unless previously converted or redeemed, the bonds will be redeemed on May
31, 2008. Sedgwick may redeem the bonds at their principal amount plus
accrued interest at any time from December 14, 1998.

Swiss deal

<TEXT>
ASPREY, the USM-quoted jewellery group, yesterday announced that it would
continue its recent expansion with the acquisition of Les Ambassadeurs, a
specialist retailer of high quality watches and jewellery in Switzerland.
The consideration of SFr24.3m (Pounds 10.8m) will be funded by a seven-year
Swiss franc term loan fully underwritten by Lloyds Bank.
Les Ambassadeurs, an affiliate of Siber Hegner Holding, is among the most
upmarket watch and jewellery chains in Switzerland. In 1992 it made profits
before interest and tax of SFr1m on sales of SFr31.1m.
Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey chief executive, said Credit Suisse had suggested
the acquisition, knowing that Asprey was keen to broaden its customer base
and expand in Europe. The group has traded in Geneva for 20 years (under the
Asprey name). It also owns Garrard, Mappin &amp; Webb - which is soon to open a
branch in Prague - Hamilton &amp; Inches, and Rene Boivin. Last June it paid
Pounds 23.2m for Watches of Switzerland.
Siber Hegner, which managed Les Ambassadeurs as a stand-alone business, is a
private, family-owned company that has specialised in trading a wide range
of Swiss precision machinery and prestige consumer products in the Far East.
About 40 per cent of its SFr1.45bn sales in 1991 came from Japan.
The acquisition is conditional upon the Swiss authorities approving the
transfer of leases over certain lengths.

HOSKINS Brewery shares were suspended yesterday on the USM at 56p at the
company's request, following an acquisition which will lead to an offer
being made for the company. Hoskins is acquiring certain assets and
businesses from Swithland Estates and Swithland Corporation, which are owned
by Mr Adam Page.
Consideration is expected to be Pounds 4.3m, supported by a property
valuation. It will be settled by Pounds 2.1m cash and 4m new shares
representing 41 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Subject to an EGM being convened, a cash offer at 55p per share will then be
made on behalf of the vendor. Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother
Robert, a director, and their immediate families have irrevocably agreed to
accept or procure acceptances of the offer in respect of 1.2m shares (20.8
per cent). Acceptances are also expected in respect of 275,146 held in trust
or in pension funds on behalf of the Hoar family.
Mr Adam Page will become chairman and chief executive. Mr Barrie Hoar, Mr
Robert Hoar, Mr Geoffrey Sharpe and Mr David Shaw will resign as directors.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Babcock refocuses after fall to Pounds 21m
 -Reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 13m contribute to the profits
downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BABCOCK International, the engineering group, is to cut up to 500 jobs at
its Renfrew plant outside Glasgow as part of a belated refocusing on
international markets.
The group set up a Pounds 13m provision for reorganisation, one of the
factors behind a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 56m to Pounds 21m on
sales down 10 per cent at Pounds 748m.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 1.1p, giving a total for the
year of 2.1p compared with 3.15p. Earnings per share fell from 8.19p to
1.72p.
Mr Jeff Whalley, acting chief executive, said the group had reorganised and
accounted for the changes which would allow Renfrew to be a smaller
manufacturing base for a more aggressive push into international markets.
The group would be sourcing some of its more basic engineering needs from
countries near where it hopes to win contracts, particularly in the Far
East.
Mr Whalley, brought in by Lord King, chairman, after Mr Oliver Whitehead
left the chief executive position in April, said the group had not been
changing direction fast enough under the previous management. Lord King is
understood to be meeting potential chief executives next week.
At the operating level profits fell from Pounds 43.6m to Pounds 32.3m.
Energy and Manufacturing halved from Pounds 17.46m to Pounds 8.75m partly
because of delays and postponements of orders. New contracts had been won in
Greece, the UK and in Hong Kong, so the division ended the year with a
forward order book of Pounds 317m, up from Pounds 295m at the end of March
1992.
Mr Whalley said Babcock was in preliminary discussions with two continental
European groups to form an energy joint venture with combined sales of
Pounds 700m that would be in a better position to compete.
Contracting and construction fell from Pounds 12.66m to Pounds 5.26m while
facilities management at Rosyth Royal Dockyard fell from Pounds 10.46m to
Pounds 6.83m.
Materials handling, enlarged by the merger of Consilium and Claudius, had
increased profits from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 12.1m while the African
division produced marginally lower profits of Pounds 6.79m (Pounds 7.13m) on
sales more than halved to Pounds 73.86m.
Net group cash fell from an abnormally high level of Pounds 111.6m to Pounds
41m. Much of this was advance payment on contracts. Mr Erik Porter, finance
director, said the underlying reduction in cash was Pounds 20m - Pounds 14m
in settlement of litigation in Germany and Pounds 5m which was invested in a
joint venture with Yorkshire Water.
Net cash would fall further this year as retentions built up from the Drax
coal-fired complex in Yorkshire.
COMMENT
It is difficult to see how Babcock can transform itself in quite the manner
management has mapped out. Unless it can find a niche, why should
multinational companies prefer to deal with a group of Babcock's size rather
than ABB, for example? With net assets of only Pounds 93m - a figure already
bolstered by a Pounds 32m pension fund surplus - and sales of Pounds 750m,
Babcock might even be ruled out of certain contracts by its modest resources
and the negative impact that big contracts would have on its cash position.
Rosyth remains an unknown quantity, but loss of the Trident re-fit contract
could mean a slow shrinking of a traditional earner. The company says it has
conservatively budgeted Pounds 200m of orders which should nearly fill
Renfrew next year. But to achieve this, Babcock is going to have to run hard
internationally. Despite the above average yield and low prospective
multiple - 8 times based on pre-tax profits forecasts of Pounds 36m for 1993
 -there are many better engineering recovery stories.

FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Lack of interest in RJB Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC has subscribed for only 20 per cent of the 6.7m shares offered to
them in RJB Mining, the group formed in a management buy-out to take
advantage of opportunities following British Coal's privatisation.
RJB is the first company this year to fail to attract widespread public
interest. Last year the market experienced a series of public flops
including Taunton Cider, The Telegraph, MFI and Anglian Group.
Institutions were more enthusiastic about prospects for RJB, however. The
company said yesterday institutional demand had exceeded the number of
shares available. Some 20m shares had been placed with institutions at 125p.
Of those, 6.7m were subject to clawback to satisfy retail demand, but the
public subscribed for only 1.3m. The applications were met in full.
Trading will start on June 7 with institutions holding 85 per cent of the
equity, retail investors and management 5 per cent and Mr Richard Budge,
chief executive, 10 per cent.
Mr Budge said the lack of interest from the public was largely due to the
gloomy headlines on British Coal. 'Too many people read what happens to
British Coal as what is happening to the coal industry and that is not
true,' he said. There were plenty of opportunities and RJB intended to
compete with world coal prices.
RJB planned to bid for the Easington colliery, one of four pits which
British Coal announced yesterday that it would put up for sale. RJB did not
intend any share issues in the near future to fund purchases of British Coal
pits.
The public response to RJB's flotation will have been strongly influenced by
the problems British Coal is experiencing in selling coal to the electricity
generators.

Pounds 65m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management, Britain's largest institutional fund management
company, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
65.1m for the year ended March 31 1993.
The company, which is 75 per cent owned by investment bank SG Warburg, has
proposed a final dividend of 12p (8.9p) making a total of 15p against 11.5p.
The results include a Pounds 2.9m gain on the sale of Mercury's sale of its
stake in fund manager Jupiter Tyndall which had been written down the year
before.
Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said the improved results reflected a net
increase in funds under management of Pounds 1.9bn. Gross funds under
management rose to Pounds 49.7bn compared with Pounds 40bn, with a
significant portion of the rise reflecting the dramatic improvement in asset
values following Britain's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism last year.
While the bulk of the net inflow consist of the institutional UK pension
fund assets which have been the mainstay of Mercury's business, a
significant portion are accounts from private clients, overseas accounts and
charities.
Funds managed for international clients have risen by about 30 per cent
during 1992-93 to Pounds 9.4bn.
Mr Stevenson explained that Mercury had spent about Pounds 25m in upgrading
its systems over the past five years which has allowed it to expand funds
under management dramatically without significant expansion in staff.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Warburg stages late recovery but falls 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a sharp profits recovery in the second half of last year for SG
Warburg, the merchant banking group which controls Mercury Asset Management,
though for the year as a whole pre-tax profits were down 11 per cent at
Pounds 148.2m.
Pre-tax profits in the second half, which ended on March 31, were Pounds 97m
compared with Pounds 51.2m in the first half. Sir David Scholey, the group's
chairman, said: 'At the halfway stage, it did not seem likely that we would
be able to show a profit before tax for the year of Pounds 148.2m.'
Lord Cairns, the group's chief executive, said that most of the recovery
came from the group's debt and equity trading activities, rather than from
its advisory businesses.
For the year as a whole, profits earned in continental Europe were flat.
There was growth in the US contribution, from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 12.5m.
Lord Cairns said that the UK and Asia were both 'down a bit'.
After tax and the deduction of minority interests' share of earnings,
profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 84.3m.
The group made a provision of Pounds 16m to cover possible losses on its
loans to Isosceles, the financially troubled supermarket group. Of this,
Pounds 8m was deducted from reported profits and the rest was charged
directly to the group's general provision, which was Pounds 20m in its
balance sheet of March 31, 1992.
The general provision, after this write-off and after tax relief, is now
Pounds 15m.
First-half profits had been depressed by the Pounds 11.6m cost of closing
the German subsidiary of its Pallas Leasing group.
Lord Cairns said its Japanese operation had begun the current year
profitably, after numbers employed in Tokyo were reduced last year. However,
Japan incurred losses last year amounting to 'a number of millions', he
said.
The bank's corporate finance department, traditionally the heart of the
group, had a quiet year in 1992, but was currently working on a 'substantial
pipeline' of possible mergers and acquisitions for corporate clients.
He said that the group in general had made a good start to the year and that
had been reflected in the board's decision to propose a dividend for the
year of 19p, a rise of 5.6 per cent. Earnings per share fell 21 per cent to
39.6p.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Queens Moat asks banks for extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 65 banks owed Pounds 1bn by Queens Moat Houses, the hotel company
suspended on the stock market last month, were yesterday urged to extend an
interest and repayments standstill until the end of October.
The company was supported by its bank steering committee, chaired by
Barclays and National Westminster, and said the standstill would give Queens
Moat time to arrange and propose a reconstruction to secure its longer term
financing.
Mr Andrew Coppel, appointed as consultant to Queens Moat last month,
described the steering committee's support as 'extremely positive'. He said
the company would be visiting its bankers over the next 10 days and a
decision on whether they would back the standstill could come in the next
few weeks.
A statement from the steering committee last night pointed to 'very positive
progress' in solving some of Queens Moat's problems. However, bankers
expressed concern at a 'considerable reduction' in Queens Moat asset values,
as revealed by a report from accountants Grant Thornton. The accountants
also reported that Queens Moat made 'substantial losses' last year instead
of profits of about Pounds 80m, as the City once expected.
After a four hour meeting with the banks in the City offices of Allen and
Overy, Queens Moat issued a short statement to confirm that Morgan Grenfell
had replaced Charterhouse as its financial adviser and Coopers &amp; Lybrand had
taken over as auditor from Bird Luckin.
Mr Coppel, former finance director of Ratners, is expected to take over as
chief executive if the banks agree to the standstill. Other board changes
are likely. On Wednesday, Mr Martin Marcus and Mr David Hersey, formerly
deputy chairman and finance director, resigned from the company.
Coopers has begun work on a formal audit for last year, which suggests
Queens Moat may seek to lift its suspension in the autumn. 'The board will
address the question of the relisting when the 1992 results are available,'
Mr Coppel said.
Coopers is also reviewing the company's accounting policies, which have been
heavily criticised since Queens Moat's problems became apparent, and blamed
for some of the profits shortfall.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Ford incurs pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Britain, the leading vehicle maker in the UK, suffered a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 353m last year, its second successive loss in its core Ford
car and light commercial vehicle operations.
The Ford parent company has been forced to pump in Pounds 330m in new equity
to shore up the balance sheet of the UK subsidiary in the face of continuing
heavy losses. The UK operation was hit last year by a further decline in car
sales, forced production cuts, and heavy marketing and restructuring costs
as well as exchange rate losses of about Pounds 100m.
The company remained in loss in the first quarter of this year and it warned
yesterday that it was uncertain whether it would return to profit in 1993.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman since January 1 last year, has
been forced to take a sharp cut in pay compared with his predecessor. He
earned Pounds 94,129 last year according to the Ford of Britain annual
report published yesterday. Mr Derek Barron, his predecessor earned Pounds
158,454 in 1991 and Pounds 214,086 in 1990. Ford of Britain's board has been
streamlined and cut from 10 to six members.
The outlook for a return to profit in 1993 has deteriorated in the face of
the steep decline in new vehicle demand in continental Europe in the first
four months this year, Mr Bill Brooks, finance director said yesterday.
About 41 per cent of vehicles from Ford's UK assembly plants were exported
last year. Ford of Britain still expected to achieve a substantial financial
improvement this year after two years of heavy losses, Mr Brooks said.
The parent company's injection of Pounds 330m in new equity into Ford of
Britain last year follows its provision of Pounds 390m of new capital in
1991 - Pounds 100m in new equity and Pounds 290m through the transfer, at an
inflated price, of the ownership of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, from
Ford of Britain direct to the US parent.
Ford of Britain made losses of Pounds 935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990
however these were heavily influenced by losses from Jaguar.
Excluding these, Ford of Britain incurred a loss of Pounds 487m in 1991 and
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 61m in 1990, on a comparable basis with last
year's pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m. This figure included a Pounds 68m
restructuring charge for redundancies.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Credit Local will begin sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government's privatisation programme yesterday rolled into action
with the announcement of plans to raise up to FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) from the
sale of a 30 per cent stake in Credit Local de France, a bank specialising
in local authority loans.
Meanwhile Societe Generale, the French bank which was privatised by the last
centre-right government, disclosed that it intends to participate in the new
round of share sales by increasing its holding in a number of privatised
companies including the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals group and Assurances
Generales de France, the insurance group.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said Societe Generale planned to play the roles of
'adviser, vendor and investor' in the forthcoming share sales. His comments
followed an appeal by the new government for private sector companies to act
as noyaux durs, long-term investors, in the newly privatised state concerns.
Societe Generale, which also yesterday announced that net profits were
likely to be static for the second successive year at FFr3.3bn in 1993, last
month took a stake in Total, the oil company, as part of a consortium of
noyaux durs.
The Credit Local share sale will be the first of the new government's
privatisation issues. The news of the issue followed shortly after Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, on Wednesday unveiled details of his plans to
sell off 21 public sector companies including Banque Nationale de Paris and
the Renault motor group.
Credit Local, which was partially privatised by the old socialist
government, was not on the Alphandery list as its privatisation was already
authorised under French law. But the sale of its shares, scheduled to take
place before the end of June, will be an important test of the stock
market's reaction to privatisations.
Credit Local, which was created in 1987 by the last conservative
administration in a review of local authority funding, has emerged unscathed
from the recent problems of the French banking industry. It recently
reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits from FFr1.07bn in 1991 to
FFr1.19bn in 1992 on consolidated net banking income up 10 per cent to
FFr2.8bn.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Hammerson plans to raise Pounds 199m in rights issue:
Property group promises to overhaul its portfolio and reform voting
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMMERSON, the UK's fifth largest property group, yesterday announced a
Pounds 199m rights issue to ease the pressure on its balance sheet.
It joins a number of investment companies that have taken advantage of the
revival in property share values to cut gearing and raise funds for
acquisitions.
The announcement was accompanied by the promise of 'cultural change' within
the company, following the appointment of new senior management last month.
Mr Ron Spinney, the new chief executive, said the company would carry out a
comprehensive strategic review of the portfolio's balance, its geographic
spread and management structure. There would be significant savings on
administrative costs over the next 18 months, he said.
The company unveiled proposals to reform its 'anachronistic' voting
structure, by which ordinary share owners receive six times as many votes as
owners of 'A' shares with the same nominal value. It plans to create a
single class of ordinary share capital on terms that reflect the market
price of the two classes of share prior to the rights issue and the terms of
the issue.
The reduction in gearing will allow 'increased flexibility' in disposals,
the company said. It also gives it scope to spend about Pounds 60m in
enlarging and upgrading existing retail properties.
Mr Spinney said he believed that the UK property market, which accounts for
41 per cent of the group's holdings, was beginning to come out of recession.
He thought that continental Europe and Canada would show improvement by the
first quarter of next year, while Australia would not improve until the end
of 1994.
The rights issue, which came as no surprise to the stock market, caused the
'A' shares to rise by 4p to 344p and the ordinary shares to fall from 380p
to 373p.
The issue, involving a 14 per cent dilution of net asset values, was made on
a 7-for-15 basis at a price of 285p for each ordinary share and 255p for
each 'A' share.
The rights issue reduces the company's pro forma gearing to 69 per cent at
the end of 1992 from 114 per cent. The sharp rise in gearing last year
prompted Hammerson to agree revised financial covenants in respect of its
borrowing facilities.
Standard Life, which owns 23.6 per cent of Hammerson, said it would take up
its full entitlement under the rights issue. The remainder has been
underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Fujitsu to cut dividend after losses despite profitable ICL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer manufacturer which owns ICL, the UK-based
computer group, has dropped into loss for the year ended March, and plans to
cut its dividend.
Pre-tax losses - Fujitsu's first since it was introduced to the stock market
in 1949 - are Y8.7bn (Pounds 51.2m) for the parent company, compared with
profits of Y40bn in 1991-92.
On a consolidated basis, the pre-tax loss was Y16.1bn against profits of
Y51.5bn after taking in losses at subsidiaries, including overseas
operations.
ICL, however, was one of the 'elite' companies, Fujitsu said. ICL made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.6m for the year ended December 1992.
Sales for the parent company dropped 1.5 per cent to Y2,398bn while on a
consolidated basis sales were up marginally at Y34,619bn.
The steep decline in investment in information technology by Japanese
corporations in the past few years came at a time when Fujitsu's costs have
been at a particularly high level. This was due to a management decision to
invest heavily in strategic areas, particularly semi-conductors, and to keep
employment levels high.
Last year, Fujitsu took in 3,600 new recruits. It is also bearing a good
part of the depreciation costs on its Pounds 200m initial investment in a
new semi-conductor plant it has built in the UK.
As a result, the decline in sales led directly to a fall in operating
profits which were down by 76 per cent to Y15.9bn.
A 4 per cent decline in sales of information processing equipment, which
make up over 73 per cent of total revenues, wiped out the beneficial impact
of a 7 per cent increase in overseas sales. Large mainframe computers, a
profitable business for Fujitsu, were particularly affected.
Fujitsu was obliged to sell stock holdings to boost its results, with a
Y14.6bn profit on securities sales.
It is not optimistic about the outlook for the current year.
Parent sales are forecast to be lower at Y2,210bn. However, Fujitsu believes
the benefits of a restructuring programme and cost cutting will help lift
pre-tax profits to Y30bn. On a consolidated basis, Fujitsu sales are
expected to drop 5 per cent drop to Y3,280bn and it hopes to break even at
the net profit level.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of SG Warburg is really a tale of two companies. Mercury Asset
Management, in which it has a 75 per cent stake and which contributes nearly
half its operating profits, is going from strength to strength. On the other
hand, the investment banking business made a return on capital last year of
only around 14 per cent despite a sharp improvement in the second half.
The temptation must be to bypass Warburg and buy straight into Mercury. Only
the possibility that Warburg's share price may not yet have fully discounted
a cyclical recovery in investment banking gives ground for second thoughts.
Warburg's poor level of disclosure would be deplored by its own star-rated
analysts if it was adopted by any other company. There is no detail on costs
and no break-down of investment banking revenue. It appears that advisory
fees are showing some recovery, but the second half turnround owes more to
increased trading activity. Making money from trading is easy when the yield
curve is positive. Warburg's bond market losses in the first half are a
reminder that its judgment is less than perfect when conditions are
difficult.
Perhaps its controls are now strong enough to reduce this risk. The
acquisition of KC-CO will enhance its skills in derivatives, where the bank
has been relatively weak, but if the shares are to offer long-term promise,
Warburg must show that it has found a sustainable way of increasing its
return.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: National Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power's ultra-cautious accounting policies disguise the true
strength of the its financial position. Despite cutting the workforce from
17,000 to 7,000 in three years, the company has found a further Pounds 150m
of future restructuring costs which need to be provided for in the 1992
figures. It has also accelerated depreciation to take account of the shorter
life of power stations. As always, purchases of British coal have been
written down to world market prices - a policy which cost Pounds 545m in
1992. The company argues that it is now having to shut newer stations with
higher book values, hence the extra provisions, while writing down coal
stocks and adjusting depreciation is no more than prudent.
All this is true so far as it goes, but the 16 per cent increase in
dividend, 3.1 times dividend cover and gearing of 13 per cent give a better
guide to the company's long term financial prospects. On projected 1993
figures, National Power has an above-market yield while its prospective
price earnings ratio is around 10. Yet the company's capacity for above
average dividend increases should ensure that its shares outperform the
market in the medium term. If it can reduce its market share further,
through a mixture of asset sales and making room for gas and nuclear plant,
it may also avoid a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The
regulatory risks, which have been the main brake on the share price, look
overdone.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Hammerson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no doubt Hammerson needed a rights issue. Having lost Pounds 1bn
of shareholders' funds since 1989, Hammerson had to strengthen its balance
sheet somehow if it was not to be forced into selling its better properties
at silly prices. The old management's record scarcely allowed it to tap
shareholders for fresh funds. Just 27 days into the job, the new chief
executive clearly did not suffer the same predicament.
The Pounds 199m proceeds will help Hammerson preserve value, with Pounds 60m
being used to spruce up its existing portfolio. But the main rationale was
simply to stop Hammerson's finances deteriorating further. Gearing will fall
from 114 per cent to 69 per cent. The cut dividend will be secured. Yet
these are meagre attractions when set against a 14 per cent dilution in net
assets - especially at a time when other companies are raising cash to buy
cheap properties to fuel income growth.
Hammerson's cash call is an opportunistic attempt to exploit the groundswell
of favourable sentiment towards the property sector as a whole. The trouble
is that the sector's principal appeals hardly apply to Hammerson. Asset
values will fall further this year while its dividend yield languishes.
Moreover, 60 per cent of its portfolio is overseas, frustrating those
seeking exposure to the UK's incipient upturn. Fund managers will surely
soon tire of stumping up funds on the basis of such skimpy stories. That,
though, may simply prompt other straitened property companies to jump in
quick.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's new shoes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has a reputation as something of a bruiser, so he may be
equipped to curb the government's deficit. But he also has an acknowledged
ambition to become prime minister. That means he must want to be liked. The
initial inference from his appointment as chancellor must be that a
growth-orientated economic policy will continue. There is a slightly
increased chance of a cut in interest rates, especially if that would help
win the Christchurch by-election, and Mr Clarke may dawdle over the PSBR.
The overall message is broadly bad for gilts and sterling, but good for
equities, yet the markets were reluctant yesterday to take the implications
on board in anything more than a tentative way. Equities showed only modest
gains, the long gilt future was broadly flat and sterling, though weaker,
still closed above DM2.50. Perhaps that stems from a realisation that Mr
Clarke is hemmed in, just as Mr Norman Lamont was. Growth is constrained by
the balance of payments; it would be difficult to cut interest rates without
a damaging row with the Bank of England's robust new governor.
Mr Lamont was outspoken about inflation but suffered from a lack of
credibility in the City, especially after the UK's exit from the ERM. Mr
Clarke does not - yet - face that handicap. Despite his European sympathies,
he also knows when to avoid breaking into French. However the markets will
judge him on the speed with which the PSBR is tackled and his readiness to
rein in monetary policy once inflation starts to rise again. They seem
sceptical but inclined to give him a chance. Given the unhappy legacies he
has left elsewhere, it would be rash to assume he will use it.

FT  28 MAY 93 / MMC hits at Boots' pricing of contact lens solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to lift restrictions on the sale of contact lens
solutions. The decision follows a monopolies investigation which found that
Allergan, the leading manufacturer, and Boots, the UK's largest chemists
chain, had kept prices artificially high.
The Department of Health said yesterday that it planned early next month to
authorise sales of the solutions by any retailer with adequate arrangements
for storage and product recall. It expected the change to make the products
as widely available as aspirin.
At present, retail sales of lens solutions are limited to about 17,000
opticians and chemists. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said in a
report yesterday that the restrictions had inhibited price competition in
the market, worth Pounds 91m last year at retail prices.
The MMC said the US-owned Allergan had exploited weak retail competition to
charge prices which generated exceptionally large profits. The report found
Boots had failed to pass on to consumers low prices it had obtained from
suppliers and had tried to prevent competitors from cutting retail prices.
Allergan welcomed the government's decision. But Boots said it was
'disappointed and surprised that the MMC has concluded that price is of
prime, indeed sole, importance in this complex market'. Any change in the
rules must not compromise product effectiveness and safety.
The MMC found that Boots' gross margins on contact lens solutions were
higher than on its retail sales overall. Boots said its margins reflected
investments in customer service and the need to provide professional advice
to consumers.
However, the MMC said: 'Boots' practice of selling all branded contact lens
solutions at recommended retail prices provides a shelter for other
retailers to do the same, while its powerful position deters others from
risking retaliation if they were to cut prices significantly.'
Superdrug, the drugstore chain owned by Kingfisher, said it planned to sell
the solutions at discount prices in all its 608 outlets as soon as it was
allowed to. The chain sells perfumes, suntan products and condoms at
discounts of as much as 30 per cent.
The government said it was committed to implementing at the start of 1995 an
EC directive intended to free cross-border sales of the solutions and other
products. It also planned talks with opticians' professional bodies on ways
to improve information to consumers about the cost of contact lens care.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Clinton economic package wins backing from House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton bounced back yesterday after a week of mishaps and
false steps by winning a victory for his economic package in the US House of
Representatives.
In the end, the result was less of a cliffhanger than predicted; the vote
was 219-213, but many of the 36 Democratic defectors delayed casting their
votes against the budget bill until they were sure it had passed.
Victory in the House does not, however, ensure final success for the budget
package. The toughest battle will now come in the Senate, where the
Democrats enjoy a much slimmer majority and where rebel Democratic senators
have much greater leverage to win concessions from the administration.
Senator David Boren, from the oil-producing state of Oklahoma, is leading
efforts to eliminate the controversial energy tax from the budget package.
His vote alone is enough to hold up the bill in the Senate finance
committee.
But some congressional staffers believe Mr Clinton might have won enough
momentum to carry his budget package, with perhaps some small modifications,
through the Senate.
Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House, acknowledged in a final plea for Mr
Clinton's budget plan that it 'is not comfortable, and it is not universally
popular', but said it was necessary to cut the federal government's deficit
by Dollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) over the next five years from the levels it
would reach if left unchecked.
The bill passed by the House last night incorporates the bulk of the budget
proposed by President Bill Clinton, with some significant modifications to
the tax components made by the Ways and Means committee.
The principal budget measures would raise Dollars 115bn over five years by
increasing personal tax rates on the wealthiest individuals; Dollars 16.4bn
by lifting the corporate income tax rate to 35 per cent; and eliminate a
number of deductions and loopholes.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Mayhew issues denial on 'one crucial' point: Iraq arms
inquiry hears clash of evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the former attorney-general, issued a detailed and
forthright denial yesterday to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that he had
attempted to suppress evidence in the supergun affair.
He was speaking after the strength of the original allegation against him by
Sir Hal Miller had been softened in revised written evidence given to Lord
Justice Scott by the ex-MP and former Conservative party vice-chairman.
Sir Hal, in his oral evidence, had referred to a meeting in April 1990 with
Sir Patrick in the lobby of the House of Commons. He said he had threatened
to produce evidence in support of Mr Peter Mitchell of Walter Somers, a
Midlands engineering company, who was facing prosecution on suspicion of
illegally exporting arts for the supergun.
Sir Patrick read from a seven-page statement that had been prepared at the
request of Lord Justice Scott before yesterday's public hearing. He said: 'I
want to say at the outset that I do not challenge Sir Hal's good faith in
giving that evidence . . . I disagree with it in one crucial respect. I
assert my absolute confidence that I never attempted, as he alleges, to
persuade him not to go to court and produce documents if Somers were
charged.'
In his revised statement read out by Lord Justice Scott at the start of
yesterday's hearing, Sir Hal amplified and amended his account of the
meeting with Sir Patrick.
He was no longer as definite that Sir Patrick had attempted to dissuade him
from going to court. He was also uncertain about whether he showed Sir
Patrick the pieces of evidence or merely 'flashed them' at him as the two
men stood in a queue, waiting to vote. Referring to the original allegation
about the advice to withhold evidence, Sir Hal said Sir Patrick 'may have
been merely testing me, but the inference I drew was that he didn't expect
me to go to court'.
Sir Hal claimed Sir Patrick said, 'You wouldn't do that, would you?' when he
threatened to go to court with evidence showing that parts for the supergun
had been exported with the apparent approval of the Department of Trade and
Industry and the knowledge of both British intelligence and the Ministry of
Defence.
But Sir Patrick said he recollected that the character of his words had
been, 'So be it', or, 'That is up to you'. He insisted that throughout his
term as attorney-general he and other government law officers had remained
vigorously independent from ministerial interference.
While casting little fresh light on government involvement in military
exports to Iraq, yesterday's evidence raised new questions about the role of
British Customs in the supergun affair.
According to Sir Patrick's evidence, senior Customs officials wanted to
proceed with the prosecution of Walter Somers on the ground that if the case
collapsed, the credibility of the government's control on export of defence
equipment to Iraq would be dealt a 'heavy blow'.
The inquiry was adjourned until June 11.

Glasses were being raised at Number 11 Downing Street last night, but not in
honour of its new occupants. The occasion was a fund-raiser arranged months
earlier by Mrs Rosemary Lamont for the Family Service Units charity. That
could be handy, since the organisation specialises in helping people with no
jobs and no homes. But the Lamonts should have been forewarned. FSU's last
reception, a year ago, was at Canary Wharf and sponsored by Olympia and
York, its owners. Days later, the development went into receivership.

Of all the graduates of the London School of Economics who have risen to
eminence world-wide, none can have achieved a bigger leap than the one who
returned there to lecture this week. He is K R Narayanan, now vice-president
of India, but born of the humblest origins in the south of the country.
From the LSE he went on to work as a journalist, author, politician, civil
servant, and ambassador to China and the US. But his success may owe less to
the first-class degree in politics he won at the school than to the help of
one of his tutors, Harold Laski, who personally commended him to Jawaharlal
Nehru.
Narayanan's harijan origins evidently struck a chord with former Labour
chairman Laski, whom Conservatives were apt to guy as the next best thing to
the devil. 'Oh don't worry,' he declared on hearing of his student's humble
birth, 'I, too, am an untouchable.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand old man of management Peter Drucker never lacks good stories to back
up his thoughts. But one lunchtime anecdote yesterday may not have been
wholly appreciated by his host, Reed Elsevier boss Peter Davis.
Drucker, sharp as ever at 83, recalled the first management committee
meeting of the Chase and Manhattan banks, back in 1954. Of the 90 people
present, he said reprovingly, he was the only one under 59. 'But it was OK',
he added quickly, 'for within five years all of them had gone. As far as I'm
concerned it is the only recipe for a merger to work.'
Whereupon, no doubt by pure coincidence, 51-year-old Davis, whose
Anglo-Dutch publishing group was formed from just such a marriage last year,
left.

It wasn't only Sir Leon Brittan's passionate espousal of European
integration which wowed his German audience at the Konrad Adenauer institute
in Bonn yesterday. It was his ability to deliver an almost hour-long speech
in impeccable German.
His performance clearly delighted the many campaigners in Bonn trying to get
German promoted to a full working language in Brussels. If it's true that
Sir Leon has ambitions to succeed Jacques Delors at the top of the
Commission, then his tour-de-force in front of Chancellor Helmut Kohl can't
have done him any harm.

Who said that foreigners can't get ahead in Japanese banks? David H Drewery,
55, who had spent all his life with Lloyds Bank until three years ago, has
won a place in banking history books by becoming the first non-Japanese to
be appointed a main board director of a big Japanese bank - Daiwa, 25th
biggest in the world.
New York-based Drewery, who parted company with Lloyds when the latter sold
its US business to Daiwa in March 1990, seems a little abashed by his speed
of ascent up the Daiwa hierarchy, especially since he can't speak Japanese.
Presumably, Drewery's old bosses at Lloyds will be conducting some sort of
post-mortem, since the promotion suggests that the Japanese have been able
to make more of a go of the business than Lloyds.

Kenneth Clarke's appointment as chancellor of the exchequer continues a
recent tradition - that the man at number 11, Downing St, should have six
letters in his surname. Four out of the previous six chancellors - Barber,
Healey, Lawson and Lamont - have met this criterion, and the 'sixers' have
been in office for 18 of the last 23 years. The two exceptions - Howe and
Major - both saw recessions start during their term of office. That either
means that Kenneth Clarke's appointment is a good omen for the UK economy,
or that he will lose his job before the next recession begins.

<TEXT>
Observer's 'Micawber' award for positive thinking goes to the annual report
just published by Ford of Britain. 'We ended 1992 on an encouraging note,'
breezes chairman Ian McAllister, before mapping out his first year's
stewardship with landmarks such as the following.
The Ford Escort was the UK best seller last year . . . Ford's share of the
commercial vehicle market rose . . . so did productivity at Dagenham by
almost a quarter . . . quality was up . . . warranty costs were down . . .
there was a Queen's Award for Exports.
To boot, he goes on, the organisation is 'well on the path towards global
competitiveness'. And, with 'exciting new products coming on stream and new
levels of performance and efficiency', now is the time 'to consolidate our
leadership of the UK automotive industry.'
With so golden a future evidently ahead, it seems a pity to look back - as
the eight-page commentary does not - to other landmarks in the rear mirror,
including:
The Pounds 353m pre-tax loss . . . the Pounds 330m new equity pumped in for
a second successive year's subvention from Detroit . . . the drop in car
production, and the shrinking car-market share . . . the loss of 5,000 jobs,
or 12 per cent of the workforce . . . the negative trade balance. After all,
it's only the annual report.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Not-so-fresh faces solve no problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Familiar, predictable, but none the less repellent. This is the quick
reaction to John Major's capitulation, after recent political setbacks, to
knee-jerk Conservative demands for a reshuffle and a new chancellor.
There was a time when Norman Lamont's resignation might have made some
sense. This was after the massive blow to confidence inflicted by the UK's
enforced departure from the exchange rate mechanism last September. Even so,
it would have done so only as part of a much wider scrutiny into the full
chain of events leading up to Black Wednesday.
Both replacing the chancellor and cabinet reshuffles are cliche reactions of
the weaker type of politician. After the reshuffle, all the problems remain
the same, the officials analysing them remain the same, and the intellectual
machinery for tackling them - if you want to call it that - remains the
same. There is just an interval for the fresh faces to learn their briefs
and for trivial Whitehall gossip. Indeed, as far as the Treasury is
concerned, the advent of a new chancellor is more likely to delay than to
hasten any needed policy reappraisal, as when Selwyn Lloyd was sacked in
similar circumstances in 1962.
The Tory party has a long history of useless blood-letting at No 11. There
are some new twists this time round, all of them distasteful. John Major has
been much more obviously pushed than Harold Macmillan used to be in both his
actions and his timing by a hysterical campaign in the Tory tabloids,
mutterings by backbenchers and by 'Tory managers', which I take to be code
for the party chairman, Sir Norman Fowler.
Another novel feature is the way in which Kenneth Clarke has shoved and
bullied his way into Number 11. At one time I was impressed by his
willingness to stand up to professional pressure groups instead of
pretending, as most Tory ministers do, that he really agreed with them.
Later I began to ask why Clarke had so much time to act as a self-appointed
economic spokesman when the Home Office, of which he was supposed to be in
charge, was full of enough problems to strain the most titanic politician.
This was not offset by Clarke's vociferous support for the Maastricht treaty
combined with the boast that he had not read it. To trumpet one's ignorance
is one of the more stupid English characteristics against which Prince
Albert fought a brave campaign, cut short by early death.
But most distasteful of all was his semi-public campaign of denigration of
Lamont and of self-promotion in order to become chancellor himself. If ever
the Tory party had really been run by gentlemen, he would have been lucky to
remain in the cabinet at all, let alone become chancellor.
Obviously Lamont was not a heroic figure, but history is likely to record
him as one of the better chancellors. His lasting achievements will be in
structural reform. An example was his gradual whittling down of mortgage tax
relief, which Margaret Thatcher had refused to touch. Another was his move
to unify tax and spending decisions in a single Budget.
He was also alert for seemingly modest but ultimately very important supply
side measures. An example was his embrace of Dennis Snower's scheme to
enable the unemployed to offer their dole as a wage subsidy instead. The
watering-down of the scheme was mainly due to stick-in-the-muds at the
employment department.
Above all, both inside and outside the ERM, he was determined to give
priority to securing and maintaining low inflation. This is not because he
was a fanatic, but because he was highly sceptical of many of the claims
made for the government's ability to promote economic growth, and realised
that it was all too easy to sacrifice price stability without helping output
and jobs in the longer run.
Lamont also knew that public sector borrowing of Pounds 50bn would sooner or
later run into trouble, and his delayed-action tax increases, designed to
take effect with economic recovery, struck the right balance.
He leaves behind an economy with a faster growth rate than that of any other
of the main G7 countries and an underlying rate of inflation lower than in
most. He had everything to gain and nothing to lose from entrenching low
inflation, and Clarke will have his work cut out to prove that his own
motivations are the same. His obvious view of No 11 as mainly a stepping
stone to the premiership will not help his street credibility.
Meanwhile Lamont can now expect a wave of sympathy from many in his own
party and outside, including those who were most vociferous in demanding his
head. But like most things in politics and life this sympathy will be too
late.

FT  28 MAY 93 / New partner at the last chance saloon: John Major has been
forced to promote to chancellor the man who may ultimately threaten his
leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is John Major's last throw. The cabinet that takes office today has not
been shaped in a moment of political calm, following a period of quiet
deliberation, as the prime minister liked to pretend that it would be. It is
much the same as yesterday's cabinet, save for a few repairs and renovations
designed to camouflage the involuntary resignation of Mr Norman Lamont.
The other changes, those among junior ministers, have a logic of their own,
founded on the happy departure of a cheerful Mr Tristan Garel-Jones from the
Foreign Office, his Maastricht work done. The purpose of the curious
reshuffle at the top is not to 'refresh' the administration, as Downing
Street put it, but to refresh the prime minister's hold on office. He was
forced to dismiss his chancellor by the voters of Newbury, at a moment
chosen by a rising chorus of would-be executioners - 'assassins', he called
them in an interview with the FT this week - in parliament and the press.
In spite of such imperatives, Mr Major evidently had to screw up his courage
before he could dismiss the man who, in November 1990, managed his campaign
to become party leader. This is hardly surprising. In matters of economic
management Mr Lamont was the prime minister's alter ego. If the chancellor
was responsible for the depth and persistence of the recession, so was the
first lord of the Treasury. If Tweedledee's authority was destroyed by the
expulsion of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday, so
was Tweedledum's. The least popular prime minister since polling began could
hardly afford to remove his unpopular chancellor; it might leave his own
position exposed.
In the event, Mr Major could hold out no longer than this week. His
resolution was strengthened when it became clear that the bill to ratify the
Maastricht treaty would pass, Mr Garel-Jones would take his leave, and there
would at least be a technical explanation for his actions. His hand was
steadied by Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party. His
heart was given courage by intimations of his own political mortality.
If fate is kind, the consequent rearrangement of chairs may come to be seen
as the beginning of the prime minister's recovery, the day on which his
erstwhile partner began a long political exile while he, Stan Laurel, began
the long march to triumph at the next general election. It is, however, a
pretty rum rearrangement. With the single exception of Mr John Redwood,
there is no addition to the cabinet; excepting Mr Lamont, there is no
subtraction. Mr Redwood, whose task is presumably to privatise Wales, is a
highly intelligent, right-wing, newcomer. Mr Lamont had similar credentials.
It is hardly a fresh beginning for a revitalised government. Perhaps it was
too much to expect anything more. For we have to face an awful truth: there
is no A-team. There is no pool of obviously superlative talent from which an
energetic new Conservative administration might have been constructed. Mr
Major has merely altered the job descriptions of a few of the members of his
perpetual B-team.
This could be fatal. Another year of parliamentary humiliation, recalled
policies, by-election losses, and uncertain economic recovery could be the
end of our hapless prime minister. Thanks to the Labour party's everlasting
deficiencies the general election victory might still be delivered, but not
by Mr Major. A new Conservative leader, possibly Mr Kenneth Clarke, would
stand on the balcony, taking the cheers from the crowds.
There is a puzzle here. The prime minister knows what Mr Clarke's game is.
The new chancellor has never hidden it. It is to become prime minister
himself. When - if - he does he will be seen grinning hugely, beer mug in
one hand, fat cigar in the other. This is not to say that he will be
disloyal to Mr Major. That would be out of character. He can, however, have
it both ways. He can adopt the costume and manner of a chancellor with as
much panache as his considerable brain and engaging personality enable him
to do, while yet telling his mirror that if the prime minister is by some
mischance toppled, then he, Kenneth, will be available.
There would be no hope for him if, in the meantime, he made a mess of his
new job. On this we must hold our breath. For all his political skills, when
it comes to management of the economy, Mr Clarke is an innocent. He will be
sandwiched between a prime minister who never forgets his own chancellorship
and a Treasury mandarinate that is accustomed to educating new bosses. He is
perhaps the only Conservative politician in play who has the self-confidence
necessary to bluster his way through such obstacles. The last one, who was
possessed of both the strong character and a knowledge of how the economy
works, was Nigel Lawson.
Mr Clarke's advantage is that he is admired for the rumbustious manner in
which he has beaten up public sector unions, from the British Medical
Association, through the Royal College of Nursing to the many combinations
of teachers. He was just squaring up to the police and the prison officers
when he was whisked out of the Home Office. These brawls have the merit of
destroying the power of vested interests; Mr Clarke's handling of them has
the demerit of leaving nothing behind that quite works. He is good at
communicating with the voters, and possesses a strong broad-brush sense of
mission. He may be better qualified to be prime minister than head of any
single department.
If he is too successful as chancellor he may never get his chance; Mr Major
will reap the benefit. Mr Clarke's aim as chancellor will nevertheless be to
make sound political judgments, as Sir Norman wants him to, and win votes
for the Tories by establishing a rapport with a disenchanted electorate, as
the party needs him to. His well-known disadvantage in this regard is that
Tory Euro-sceptics mistrust him, which they well might, since on matters
European he is the nearest thing in the cabinet to Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
leader of the federalist Liberal Democrats.
Perhaps I am a trifle unfair. Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary,
is more Euro-centric than Mr Clarke; he confesses to regretting the passage
of the Holy Roman Empire. What is remarkable is the continuing strength of
the pro-Europeans in Mr Major's cabinet. With the foreign secretary, Mr
Douglas Hurd, heading the field, they dominate the top echelons of the
government. This is to the prime minister's credit. He has not sold out to
the Euro-sceptics, as he might have done had he made Mr Michael Howard
chancellor rather than home secretary. The latter appointment should,
however, placate the Tory right.
Moving Mrs Gillian Shephard from employment to agriculture might be said to
be a step in the sceptical direction, but then Mrs Shephard has yet to
demonstrate that she can make an impact on any department. Mr David Hunt,
her successor as employment secretary, has a good reputation as an
individual of quality, although you have to discount for the context in
which this assessment is made. He has managed Wales in more or less the
Peter Walker left-of-centre tradition. Last night Mr Redwood was at pains to
reassure his new subjects; he would be no hatchet-man, he intimated.
In short, it is hard to see what will have changed, beyond the career
prospects of a few politicians. Mr Major is still Mr Major, with the same
virtues and faults he had 24 hours ago. The government's majority is still
18. A forthcoming by-election may reduce it further. The public sector
borrowing requirement is still expected to rise to Pounds 50bn. Proposals
for spending cuts will still run into backbench opposition, suggestions that
there should be tax increases quickly shot down.
Just as President Clinton is wrestling with his own party in Congress, so
the phenomenon known as 'gridlock', formerly confined to Washington, may be
spreading to Mr Major's government in Britain. He knows what must be done to
burst out of it. He needs: a period free of political pratfalls, a run of
months of accident-free government, a strong economic recovery and a
chancellor well able to spread the good news, a sign of the green shoots of
Conservative electoral recovery, and a huge amount of good luck. Without all
of that, he is done for.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Leading Article: A welcome thaw in Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN might have longed to be part of the traffic in Downing
Street yesterday. But in the governor's mansion in Hong Kong, he can take
heart from a thawing of the Chinese freeze on discussions imposed in
response to the constitutional proposals he made last October.
The business of the Joint Liaison Group, the body overseeing the detail of
the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty, has
resumed with China's approval of franchises for electricity, cable
television and land-fill. It was announced yesterday that the Sino-British
Airport Committee would meet on June 4 to discuss financing for Hong Kong's
new airport - China has withheld agreement on funding arrangements because
of its opposition to Mr Patten's proposals.
Most important, talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's constitution have progressed
through three rounds and appear to have gone beyond the initial exhaustive
statement of principles. Though they seem still some distance - perhaps
months - from the end, they are evidence of a more practical approach from
Beijing.
Six-month aberration
Critics of Mr Patten's style of dealing with China say that London-Beijing
relations have returned to previous practice after a six-month aberration
caused by his proposals. What they mean is that things were successfully
agreed in secret discussions in Beijing, and then announced to the people of
Hong Kong. Mr Patten broke with that style, announcing his proposals without
consulting the Chinese, and trying to expand the role of Hong Kong's
legislators in the decision-making process. But according to the critics,
Sino-British dealings have now reverted to the smoke-filled room: a secretly
negotiated deal will emerge, to be nodded through by the Legislative
Council.
If an agreement does emerge from the Beijing talks, it is certainly
difficult to imagine Legco stopping it - though it is to be strongly hoped
that it will be framed with the need for its approval in mind. Such an
accord may well represent a substantial watering down of Mr Patten's plan to
broaden the electoral franchise. However, it would be wrong to suggest that
Mr Patten's approach had been fruitless. It has already produced lively,
democratic debate in Hong Kong itself, of precisely the nature China did not
want to see. Mr Patten may succeed in broadening democracy while preserving
convergence with the post-1997 Basic Law.
Beijing's invective
The invective which Beijing has hurled at Mr Patten has neither forced him
to back down nor undermined his popular support in Hong Kong. The cards
which Mr Patten holds - the importance of Hong Kong's prosperity to China's
growth, the huge investment stake held by China in the territory - have
gradually asserted themselves as factors which China must take into account.
And China has returned to the negotiating table.
China has larger reasons for wanting a smooth transition which secures Hong
Kong's prosperity. Its international image has become increasingly important
to it. China desperately wants to be awarded the Olympic Games in 2000. It
wanted - and has all but obtained - renewal by President Bill Clinton of its
most-favoured nation trading status. It has tried hard to keep such issues
away from Hong Kong which it regards as something separate, to be negotiated
only with London. But the country's increasing openness to the world
inevitably means that issues become linked.
China's desire for reunification with Taiwan - its highest foreign policy
priority - is the biggest reason for Beijing to want to ensure stability in
Hong Kong. The growing desire in Taiwan for de jure independence from China
 -anathema to leaders both in Beijing and Taipei - has already led to
'unofficial' mainland/Taiwan talks and agreement to hold more. China will
want to be seen as a good landlord in Hong Kong because its actions will be
closely watched from Taiwan. This may be Hong Kong's best and longest-term
insurance policy. It certainly underlines the importance of a sensible
outcome to the Beijing talks, not only for the participants, but also for
anyone with a stake in this dynamic region.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke goes to Number 11
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMAN LAMONT departed from Number 11 Downing Street yesterday, rather than
last autumn, because the prime minister needed first to ratify the
Maastricht treaty. Kenneth Clarke replaced him because of his political
skills. Yet the reshuffle still looks the fruit of frailty rather than of
foresight. Mr Lamont had to go. Mr Clarke is as credible a replacement as
any. But the prime minister and his new chancellor have a mountainous task
to demonstrate that the change means an improvement.
Pity Mr Lamont, a man who has genuine achievements to his credit. The new
unified Budget is one. Since sterling's exit from the ERM, he has also set
an explicit target for inflation, established a new panel of outside
forecasters, commissioned the Bank of England's inflation report and given
an explicit counter-inflationary mandate to the new governor. Among a number
of imaginative fiscal policy reforms is this year's multi-stage Budget.
Above all, when Mr Lamont became chancellor of the exchequer underlying
inflation was running at an annual rate of 8 per cent. Now it is 3 per cent.
But this welcome change was the fruit of the longest recession since the
1930s. The recession was as unpopular as the chancellor's prattling about
'green shoots' was ill-judged. ERM membership, a policy that Mr Lamont
inherited from Mr Major, made the government persist with disinflation. As
such, it was the source both of the government's principal success and Mr
Lamont's downfall.
Ritual of reshuffles
The ex-chancellor's fate has elements of irony. Since he had no choice but
to reiterate his commitment to the ERM parity, sterling's exit from the ERM,
which brought forward the desired recovery, inevitably destroyed his
credibility. But it also damaged that of the man who had chosen both policy
and chancellor. For Mr Major to be forced to drop a chancellor for damage
done by the collapse of the prime minister's policy, only to replace him
with a rival for the premiership, shows how badly he too has been damaged.
The ritual of reshuffles can too easily be an alternative to serious
policy-making. It ensures, among other things, that ministers are around
long enough to do damage, but not long enough to learn from experience. The
suspicion that this has been true of Mr Clarke cannot easily be stilled.
The new chancellor has many merits. He is, for example, an excellent
advocate for his policies. He is also prepared to take on powerful interest
groups. But he sometimes seems to like upsetting people almost for its own
sake. Judged by what he left behind him in health and education, he may also
lack the meticulous attention to detail and intellectual rigour required of
a great reforming minister.
Rare opportunity
Mr Clarke has, in short, much to prove in taking on the second most
important job in government. A good chancellor must be both prudent and
tough. He must master an exceptionally complex brief and combine broad
economic vision with interest in the details of financial and fiscal reform.
Not least, he must have the diplomatic skills to deal with his peers in the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the European Community,
often from a position of weakness.
Above all, the chancellor must be able to work closely with the prime
minister. So long as the structure of British government remains as
centralised as it is, this relationship will be the pivot of politics.
Important decisions have to be taken. One is whether the UK is soon to
rejoin the ERM. Ideally, as Mr Clarke himself has stated, this should be
postponed. If it is, however, he will be in charge of a discretionary
policy, subject to huge pressures to choose another inflationary dash for
growth. Nothing in British experience suggests those pressures will be
resisted. But posterity will judge Mr Clarke by whether he does. He will
also be judged by how imaginatively he tackles fiscal and institutional
reform.
Mr Clarke has at least the good fortune to inherit an economy standing on
the brink of sustained recovery. He must show himself capable of combining
with the prime minister to exploit that rare, if fragile, opportunity.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: High definition and digital TV battle unresolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MARK SHURMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The news that three consortia in the US high definition television
contest have agreed a 'grand alliance' which will submit a single digital
standard to the Federal Communications Commission is welcome ('US deal will
speed start of HDTV', May 25). The choice of the more flexible digital
terrestrial system undoubtedly gives HDTV its greatest chance of success and
marks a considerable technological achievement for the Americans. All is,
however, not lost for Europe's beleaguered consumer electronics industry.
One must, for example, remain sceptical about the size of HDTV's potential
market. It is not clear how much the viewer will value improved picture
definition. HDTV is, in the short to medium term at least, likely to be
confined to niche premium markets, such as film and live-sport channels. Our
own estimates for this niche suggest a worldwide receiver market of Dollars
5.53bn by 2004 - considerably less than dedicated HDTV advocates would have
you believe.
Rather more significant is the impact that digital technology will have on
normal definition services. Digital TV is more efficient; it uses less
band-width. This means viewers will be able to receive many more channels.
Since viewers value programme choice and quality above picture quality, it
is to normal definition digital television that Europe's consumer
electronics industry should now turn its attention.

On the face of it, the South Korean phenomenon flatly contradicts the idea
that the markets know best. In the period 1980-91, the Korean economy grew
by 10 per cent a year. The driving force was the expansion of heavy
industry, which in turn was the product of state planning on a gigantic
scale. Korea can now boast the world's biggest steel mill, car plant,
shipyard and TV factory. If this has a Stalinist ring to it, there are two
striking differences. None of these ventures is state-owned, and all of them
make money.
But the Korean model seems to be in trouble. An essential element of policy
under the old military regime was to screw down wages as a means of
promoting exports. In the late 1980s the regime started to lose its grip,
and the lid blew off. In the past five years, industrial wages have gone up
by some 130 per cent.
Meanwhile, the world recession has halved Korea's growth rate. The country
is now in a jam. It is no longer cheap enough to compete with an emerging
giant such as China, but lacking the technology to take on Japan or the US.
This is a situation which old-style planning cannot easily address. To
attract the technology its industry needs, Korea must relax its traditional
hostility to foreigners, the Japanese in particular. It must open its
markets, allow foreign control of its companies and modernise its primitive
financial system. In other words, it must abandon the conditions which made
planning possible in the first place.
The old system also had one serious side-effect - it brought forth monsters,
in the shape of Korea's giant conglomerates, or chaebol. These groups -
Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and the rest - have some remarkable achievements to
their credit. But for many Koreans, they have become symbols of corruption
and economic inefficiency. Their business strategies, such as duplicating
each others' efforts in cars or petrochemicals, are condemned by government
officials as wasteful and egotistical. But in many cases they are also a
rational response to market distortions caused by the planning process
itself.
In discussing where to go from here, Korean officialdom betrays a certain
inconsistency. Last month the trade and industry minister, Mr Kim Chul-Su,
assured foreign journalists that the government had no intention of
targeting specific industries. At the same time, he added, there were 15
industries which it wanted to strengthen in the next few years. Again, while
it is essential for Korea to develop its own technology, government
economists insist that old-style methods will not be used to get there. But
the Ministry of Finance has a list of 11 specific technologies in which it
wants the country to be self-sufficient by 2010.
'There is an apparent internal contradiction in our industrial policy,' says
Mr Young Soogil, a senior member of the government's Economic Planning
Board. 'But that simply shows we're at a loss on what to do.'
In formal terms, he explains, the government stopped picking sectors as long
ago as 1985, when it switched to a so-called generic approach. In theory,
this meant the government would confine itself to working on technological
development and the industrial structure.
'But the recent economic slowdown,' says Mr Young, 'has led Koreans -
rightly or wrongly - to question the wisdom of that. The Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Energy has been arguing that we should combine a sectoral
approach with the generic approach. The Economic Planning Board has been
resisting that.'
All this is being hammered out in the context of the latest five-year plan,
in itself a quaintly old-fashioned concept. 'The plan we're working on,' Mr
Young says, 'emphasises a stronger role for technology, the development of
small-to-medium companies, the supply of a trained workforce and the supply
of industrial land, which has been in acute shortage in recent years. We're
also working on the infrastructure, such as highways and the information
industry.'
The planners are also debating what should be done at the micro level.
'Again, the emphasis is on technology, and on technology-oriented industries
such as semiconductors. The government would like to orchestrate
industry-wide efforts on bottleneck technologies and core components, in
which we're very reliant on Japan. And in declining industries such as shoes
and textiles, the government has been helping firms shrink and diversify,'
says Mr Young. If a list like that represents the laisser-faire wing of the
debate, one has to conclude that the old planning tradition still has some
life in it.
But perhaps the most pressing issue for the planners is the chaebol.
Although privately owned and managed, these groups are in a sense government
creations, having been loaded with subsidies and special treatment over the
years as the chosen vehicles for industrial policy.
'The chaebol issue involves two problems,' says Mr Sakong Il, a former
Korean finance minister. 'One is legitimacy. People get emotional because
they think the chaebol accumulated their assets by very undesirable means -
by government subsidies or real estate speculation. That has to do with the
process. The other problem has to do with the result of that process, which
is the economic concentration of power.
'Looked at that way, the policy prescription is very clear. Get rid of
illegitimate ways of making money, and you ensure future legitimacy. As for
concentration of power, that can be taken care of by strengthening antitrust
legislation,' says Mr Sakong.
The question is how realistic this is. The new president, Mr Kim Young-Sam,
has little reason to favour the chaebol, if only because the boss of Hyundai
stood against him in last year's election. But, according to a western
diplomat: 'The government talks of free-market ideas, but as soon as the
chaebol object it backs down. The longer we wait, the less prospect there is
of reform. While the government is preparing its strategy, so are the
chaebol.'
The broader issue of free markets is neatly illustrated by what is
officially known as Korea's import diversification policy. This is a simple
ban on all Japanese imports of some 30 products, the most important being
cars.
The memory of 35 years of Japanese occupation runs deep in Korea. 'For
historical and psychological reasons,' says Mr Young, 'the feeling is that
if we removed these restrictions, the dependence on Japan would become
absolute. That's regarded as politically unacceptable.'
As an aggressive exporter, Korea can plainly not maintain trade barriers
forever. Dismantling them completely, however, would cause uproar. The car
industry, for instance, is ludicrously overcrowded, with seven domestic
competitors and others waiting to join. Agriculture and banking are in an
even worse state.
'They have no competitive position at all,' Mr Young says. 'If they were
exposed to foreign competitors, they would collapse.'
But if the Korean miracle is fading slightly, it cannot yet be written off.
Korea's industrial giants may have had a sheltered youth, but the best of
them are now robust enough to tackle world markets head on.
In 1985 the founder of Samsung decided to branch out into semiconductors.
His executives, as they are now happy to tell you, thought he was mad.
Samsung has since overtaken the Japanese as the biggest producer of basic
memory chips, and is making money while the Japanese semiconductor makers
are losing. Planned or unplanned, Korean industry deserves watching.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Revolt against the regulators: The case for curbing the
watchdogs of Britain's privatised utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demands are mounting to clip the wings of the watchdogs responsible for
regulating the UK's privatised gas, telecommunications, water and
electricity utilities. The call for change is being led by the utilities
themselves, angry at what they see as interference in the running of their
businesses at the expense of their shareholders. The regulators, they
allege, have too much power, too much discretion and too little
accountability.
The utilities - led by British Telecommunications and British Gas - have
made public statements and held private meetings to put forward their line.
The overall aim has been to raise concern in the City of London's financial
community, parliament and the press about who regulates the regulators.
Although the criticism started about a year ago, it moved up a gear with the
current Monopolies and Mergers Commission probe of British Gas'
near-monopoly position. The MMC will adjudicate in the bitter dispute
between the company and Ofgas, its regulator. 'What comes out of the MMC is
bound to influence other regulators,' says Professor Stephen Littlechild,
director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator.
The utilities sense the opportunity to tilt the balance of regulation in
their favour because they believe Sir James McKinnon, director-general of
Ofgas, has exposed himself by his high-profile attack on British Gas. The
regulators have defended themselves against criticism, arguing that
regulation is necessary to prevent the utilities - which have strong
monopoly positions - from overcharging their customers.
But Sir James, the focus of most criticism, admits he is being outgunned by
British Gas: 'We don't have the resources to take full-page advertisements
to say how good we are. We don't have the money to wine and dine people - to
take MPs on as advisers.'
Running parallel to the public statements of the utilities and their
regulators has been a proxy battle between rival sets of economists. The
utilities' cause has been promoted by Mr Cento Veljanovski and Mr Dieter
Helm; the regulators have been supported by Professor John Kay and Sir
Christopher Foster.
Mr Helm, who has done consultancy work for British Gas among others, argues
that the 'regulatory framework is in crisis'. Mr Veljanovski, whose clients
include BT and who has written a paper on reforming the regulatory system,
accuses the regulators of a 'capricious exercise of the police powers of the
state'.
On the other side of the debate, Prof Kay describes what is increasingly
known as the Veljanovski critique as a 'travesty of reality'. Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, says: 'The idea that poor
struggling utilities are being kicked from pillar to post, their share
prices falling and their shareholders unable to support their families,
seems to me a slightly overplayed tune.'
Sir Christopher Foster, who is advising the government on rail privatisation
and has written a book on monopoly regulation, argues that the UK's system
of independent regulators is better than the alternatives: nationalisation,
regulation by parliament or regulation by the courts.
Behind the rhetoric, there are actually three separate debates - on the
style, substance and system of regulation - which have become entangled. As
far as style is concerned, the allegation - aimed principally at Sir James
and Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general until last year - is that
the regulators are confrontational.
The response is that Oftel and Ofgas face recalcitrant monopolists, in
contrast with Ofwat and Offer, whose industries were broken up before
privatisation. On substance, the main issues before the MMC are whether
British Gas should be broken up to promote competition and its level of
profitability. These issues have been dwarfed in the public debate by the
heated discussion about style.
The debate about whether the system needs changing - the
'who-regulates-the-regulators' debate proper - revolves around four main
allegations:
The regulators have too much power. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has
focused on their desire to accumulate power: 'Regulators like to regulate.
This is how they can make their mark and it requires more disinterestedness
than the average human being can muster not to wish to make a mark.'
Their response is that, if their powers were curbed, the utilities would
overcharge customers and drive fledgling competitors out of the market.
The regulators are excessively secretive, in particular they do not give
sufficient reasons for their decisions or back them up with detailed
financial information.
The defence, often given by Sir Bryan - at whom this charge was frequently
levelled - is that he was unable to reveal financial details on grounds of
commercial confidentiality. As for not giving reasons, he says this could
have exposed him to judicial review and so delayed the introduction of
competition.
The regulators are not sufficiently accountable. Here they argue that they
are accountable to the MMC on most important matters if there is a dispute,
as shown by the current British Gas investigation. 'The permanent question
is: would the MMC back me?' explains Prof Littlechild. The regulators have
too much discretion. The defence is that, if their discretion were to be
narrowed, there would have to be a mass of detailed rules and regulations on
top of those that already exist. Sir Christopher says this would make the
system more legalistic and allow the utilities to use their deeper pockets
to tie their regulators up in knots.
So far there is no sign that the government wishes to change the system. It
is also possible that, if the MMC rules in British Gas's favour, the other
utilities might think there was not so much to fear from the regulators
after all.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Solution to fundamental ERM problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AVINASH PERSAUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your leader, 'Complacency on the ERM' (May 25), rightly bemoans the
complacency of the EC monetary committee's report into the workings of the
exchange rate mechanism. No one could have witnessed the events of the past
six months without concluding that the ERM is far from healthy. Indeed, at
times the illness afflicting the ERM appeared fatal. However, the committee
is not alone in failing to propose remedial action.
It is possible to identify two fundamental problems with the ERM. Both are
potentially solvable. German reunification lies at the heart of last
September's crisis. It transformed the system's anchor currency, the D-Mark,
from a low-inflation currency into a high-inflation one. Germany now has the
highest inflation rate of all the European Monetary System states, save
Portugal and Greece. Convergence upon a high-inflation anchor yields an
explosive process of rising real interest rates and deteriorating economic
prospects. The best solution would have been for a general D-Mark
revaluation that would have reduced the European-wide cost of German
deflation. With greater pain than might otherwise have been inflicted, a
D-Mark revaluation is in effect what has occurred in the ERM over the past
six months. The high-inflation anchor problem is thus of diminishing
importance.
But there remains another intractable problem. The prospect of European
monetary union gives the ERM the force to withstand realignment pressures.
Dashed hopes of an early move to Emu sparked September's currency debacle.
However, the political will necessary to underwrite the economic pain
required for the Maastricht convergence criteria to be met is no longer
there. The fiscal conditions alone imply a draconian tightening of the EC's
collective fiscal stance amid record and rising rates of unemployment.
Unless the convergence criteria is balanced to ensure economic growth as
well as fiscal prudence, Emu will be postponed indefinitely thereby
condemning the ERM to being nothing more than a system of crawling currency
pegs.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Clean break no option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PAT WITTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ,'The cost of a clean break' (May 22/23) made no reference
to the effect of the 1991 Child Support Act on such settlements when a
qualifying child is involved.
Absent parents who have made a one-off capital payment as a clean break
settlement in divorce should be warned that they may still have to pay
maintenance for their children.
Consider the case in which the parent with care of the children after
divorce is a working wife who accepted the family house as a clean break
settlement. If she now loses her job and claims state benefits, then the
Child Support Agency will use a standard formula to calculate the
maintenance requirement for the children. Given the same income and
allowable expenses, the father who has previously paid thousands in a
capital sum will be required to pay the same maintenance as the father who
has hitherto paid nothing.
The Child Support Agency has widespread powers to recover this maintenance,
making it a priority debt on a par with income tax and VAT.
Where children are concerned a clean break settlement may well be a thing of
the past unless the ruling is challenged in the courts.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Science: real markets and knotty problem (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr NEIL A DOWNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial on the science policy review ('An attempt to see the
future', May 27), you unwittingly highlight a knotty problem in industrial
R&amp;D funding. There is no point, you say by way of example, in backing a
Pounds 10m laser research project if there is no UK industry to make the
advanced lasers developed by it. This argument was put forward by the 1992
Fairclough report on information technology R&amp;D, and used to recommend
abandonment of silicon microelectronics research.
However, life is really not so simple today. The world of high technology
knows no national boundaries. Your 'UK industry' may be a UK-owned
multinational with R&amp;D in New Jersey and production in Osaka. Or it might be
a small Canadian group with manufacturing in Birmingham. Furthermore, your
laser project might be part of an international collaboration - the Jessi
semiconductor programme is a good example - with research and exploitation
spread over many countries.
The 'no UK industry' argument is a dangerous oversimplification and must be
rigorously tested whenever used.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The white paper published by the Office of Science and Technology
stressed the importance of engineering to wealth creation ('Hunt for winning
ideas heads science research proposals', May 27). By creating a research
council specifically for engineering and physical sciences it should be
possible for the government to fund the research projects which relate to
real markets and will aid the nation's future prosperity.
The establishment of an advisory body for key technologies is also most
welcome. It is these new technologies from which we will create the
businesses of the future and improve our competitiveness.
I also welcome the transfer of the Link programme and the Teaching Company
Scheme from Department of Trade and Industry to the Office of Science and
Technology. By being closer to the science base these important programmes
should be much enhanced and should also ensure that the industries concerned
develop closer ties with universities.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Coward's 'Relative Values' - Chichester Festival
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Noel Pierce Coward wrote Relative Values in 1951 and dedicated it to his
butler. The play is like an unfortunate martini which has lingered too long
in the shadow of the Vermouth bottle: it is too sweet, and it lacks bite and
body. But it suits the taste of director Tim Luscombe in the settled
ambiance of the Festival Theatre at Chichester, where Relative Values is
revived for the second time only since its opening. This is mild
entertainment carried off with skill, an evening neither shaken nor stirred
but rippled.
Relative Values was Coward's first comedy since Blythe Spirit. It keeps an
uneasy place in a tradition which looks back to Wilde and Shaw in its form,
and nervously forward to the new wave of 1950s British theatre in its
incipient concerns. The play flirts with English class obsession by showing
class etiquette in action as the social revolution of 1945 slips into a
dystropic past.
Coward used the plot to serve up society in aspic. Countess Marshwood runs a
house in Kent: Moxie the maid, and Crestwell the butler head a domestic
entourage whose purpose is to maintain the distinctions which created it in
the first place. This English calm finds itself threatened when the
Countess' son proposes to marry an American film actress called Miranda.
Moxie reveals that Miranda is her estranged and unknowing sister. What to
do? Promote the maid to daughter-in-law? or pretend she is a friend? Both
unthinkable. The Countess disrupts the impending marriage by using an
American admirer of Miranda who arrives, with shameless fortuitousness,
during dessert. Order reasserts itself, and Crestwell drinks to 'the final
inglorious disintegration of the most unlikely dream that ever troubled the
foolish heart of man - Social Equality.'
As social polemic, this represents Coward at his weakest; as plot, it
maintains a basic unity and credulity. Each scene pushes toward social
rather than comic or dramatic consequences. In good farce, the chambermaid
and the countess are of equal plot value, but in Coward the countess always
pulls rank.
However, the quality of the design and the acting offset the shortcomings of
Coward's play. Rob Howell's beautiful wrap around screen suits the Hollywood
view of England and nods at Coward's meticulous proscenium stage directions
(for The Savoy Theatre) by flattening the open stage at the Chichester
Theatre. It represents the inside of Marshwood House in clever trompe oeil
style.
Susan Hampshire as the Countess and Sarah Brightman as the American threat
are neatly balanced, but Coward puts the Countess too much in control to
make their exchanges exciting: 'I'm not quite as stupid as you think', says
Miranda; 'I'm so glad' replies the Countess. Hampshire times the quick
interchanges perfectly and her silvery voice means privilege. Elsewhere,
Venetia Barrett as Lady Hayling, the battleship whom her admiral husband
married, is the voice of aristocratic shock, all church fetes and outraged
sensibility.
Anthony Bate as the butler, proud to know his place and intelligent enough
to see the choice he has made, links the scenes with limber ease. He says
'Comedies of manners swiftly become obsolete when there are no longer any
manners,' predicting the play's and England's future in 1951. After all the
affirmations of the status quo, it was change Coward feared most, or change
beyond his control. The Countess provides the English answer - pretend
nothing is happening: 'Class? Oh dear, I've forgotten what the word means.'

Two films shine through what would otherwise be the kind of wilderness unfit
even for Ozymandias. The first, My cousin Rachel (Channel 4, 2pm), is not
the best cinematic rendition of Daphne du Maurier, but with Olivia de
Havilland and Richard Burton it gets pretty close.
The second is Frankenstein (Channel 4, 11.10pm), the often-imitated but
never-bettered version directed by James Whale in 1931, with Boris Karloff
as the monster.
The only question is - how to fill the nine hours in between? Brookside
(Channel 4, 8.30pm) promises much, and the return of Garden Club (Channel 4,
9pm) immediately afterwards is a boost.
But BBC1 these days has a very soggy feel to it on Friday evenings, for
example recycling the excellent Casualty (BBC1, 8pm) rather than bringing
out a new series.
One of the oddities of the year must be Edward Bond's first play for TV, a
three-parter beginning tonight. Olly's prison (BBC2 11.15pm) stars the
superb Bernard Hill so it probably won't be awful; though given Bond's gift
for dreary obscurantism I am placing no bets.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Studs - London Fringe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All soccer is drama, but no play is a soccer match. English player Paul
Gascoigne made a plausible 'Phantom of the Opera' with the protective face
mask he wore during Lazio's 5-0 defeat of Ancona; there was a standing
ovation for him. One nil to soccer. But now with Studs at the Tricycle
Theatre, the Irish company Passion Machine puts the soccer back into drama.
It makes unusual viewing. Studs presents eleven players on stage in a high
energy - if overlong - soccer play. The locker-room dialogue is brawling and
chaotic, but the on-pitch movement around the small Tricycle stage makes a
study in agility and precision.
The play tells of Emmet Rovers, a team so incompetent that its left wing,
who never gets the ball, advertises for a manager. One candidate applies. He
appears to have a footballing past. He licks the Rovers into shape, they
topple the cup holders and breeze through to the final . . . which they
lose. The manager turns out to be an alcoholic with the same name as the
great footballer the Rovers took him for; and now a developer has started to
build on their home pitch.
The transformation of no-hopers into champs is a film and theatre staple:
Studs does for soccer what Pygmalion does for elocution and Stepping Out for
dancing. Nor is a play about soccer, alongside An Evening With Gary Lineker
or The Boy's Own Story, an original idea.
Paul Mercier's writing and direction runs the action on a kind of
high-octane essence of locker-room: swearing, chanting, weeping, shouting
and laughing. The strength of this play lies in the choreographed direction
of the match scenes. Here, each player is spotlighted with the ball, and
delivers a monologue of his thoughts as he tears down the pitch, while the
other players provide the rest of the game's noise and tension.
Tricycle Theatre (071 328 1000) until June 19

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Antony and Cleopatra - Theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Octavius Caesar is told of the death of Antony, he responds, 'The
breaking of so great a thing Should make a greater crack,' then goes into
hyperbole: 'The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets, And
citizens to their dens.'
Not in this production. The most you can expect to hear from the death of
Richard Johnson's Antony is a dull thud as he slumps from his couch onto the
floor, having forgotten where he put his sword. I disliked John Caird's
direction when his Antony and Cleopatra was first shown at Stratford last
autumn. It has not improved with time, nor with the greater space offered by
the Barbican. The faults have become more glaring.
The trouble is that there is nothing to show that this Antony either was or
deserved to be a triple pillar of the world. He is an old man over the top,
a curious mixture of Lear and Falstaff straying into the wrong play.
There is nothing regal about Clare Higgins's Cleopatra either. She behaves,
despite her age, which - given the number of her children and past
experience - must be considerable, like an immature tart. She is not a queen
of Egypt, unless you take the racist view that people who live on the
southern side of the Mediterranean are somehow inferior. The production is
not a compliment to Egyptian civilisation.
Rome does not come off much better. In the scene where Lepidus is carried
out drunk, the Romans look like past undergraduates reliving a boat night
supper. The affair between Antony and Cleopatra is presented as
run-of-the-mill adultery between an elderly man and a woman who is older
than she looks. Antony is overweight and no longer cares about his dress.
Cleopatra's clothes, except perhaps at her suicide, would not win prizes in
a Paris or Italian salon. It is straight sexual infatuation from start to
finish. Style is out.
Does this matter? Yes, because it is against the text, which contains some
of the finest poetry (poetry, not verse) that Shakespeare wrote. It is
inconceivable that he would have given it to a pair of sluts. Johnson and Ms
Higgins proceed by trying to pretend that the poetry does not exist. When
Antony says 'The long day's task is done And we must sleep', one wonders
what he has been doing in the meantime. Certainly any glory belonged to the
period before the play began.
Two performances stand out. One is Phyllida Hancock as Octavia. She at least
shows that there is some dignity in Rome, whatever the rest of the Romans
do. The other is Ken Christiansen as Mardian, the eunuch in the Egyptian
court. At times he comforts the queen much in the way that the Fool comforts
the king in the RSC's current production of King Lear. But it is an odd
production of Antony and Cleopatra where the first prize goes to the eunuch.
Go downstairs and see The Changeling at the Pit.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: The Nose - Brighton Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Moscow Chamber Opera has brought four programmes to Brighton. John
Allison reported here earlier in the week on the first two of them, the
Rostov Mysteries and the triple bill of Shostakovich and Stravinsky; another
programme combines Mozart and Salieri, while on Wednesday the company gave
the first of two performances of what is perhaps their most celebrated show,
Boris Pokrovsky's staging of Shostakovich's early comic opera after Gogol,
The Nose.
Shostakovich himself give his imprimatur to Pokrovsky's realisation, which
in 1974 rehabilitated the work in the Soviet Union after it had spent more
than 40 years beyond the pale. It has remained in their repertoire ever
since, faithfully replicated on many foreign tours. Though the New Opera
Company staged it in English translation in London in the 1970s The Nose
remains little known in Britain; it was composed in 1928 and first performed
two years later, running for 16 performances until proscribed by Stalin.
Whether the fierce satire of the pretensions of officialdom or the
nose-thumbing irreverence of the music caused the main offence is not known.
As a virtuoso demonstration of the young Shostakovich running through his
repertory, though, (it was composed between the Second and Third Symphonies,
the most 'advanced' in the canon) The Nose remains brilliantly effective.
There are more more than 80 separately identified roles, and a breathless
urgency to the writing, which often thins down the orchestral writing to a
single line or single tone colour, hijacks the most commonplace tunes, and
then throws in a virtuoso set piece - an interlude for the percussion alone,
the orchestral gallop that is probably the score's most familiar number, or
an extraordinary eight-part canon for voices that closes one scene.
In performance the opera sometimes seems more like a revue than a through
composed piece of music theatre. As the preening bureaucrat Kovalyov hunts
through 1830s St Petersburg for his nose, which is masquerading as a state
official, time and again confronting small-minded officialdom, the
predominant mood seems one of brittle absurdity. Sometimes, though deeper
currents well up, and then the constructivist dissonances give way to a
lyrical melancholy that harks straight back to Musorgsky.
The proportions are not quite right - the third act is too long and hangs
fire before the finale but the Moscow performance plays it for all it is
worth. The cast works heroically, changing roles at top speed in a
brilliantly choreographed scheme, always keeping the action on a cusp
between outright farce and biting social comment. It could all be driven
slightly harder and made more brilliant; the orchestral playing under
Vladimir Agronsky was always secure but never dashing, the singing (headed
by Eduard Akimov's Kovalyov, Boris Druzhinin as his servant Ivan) was
colourful, sometimes passionately intense.
The Nose is never going to be more than a fringe work as far as British
audiences are concerned. For Russians, though, it continues to have a huge
resonance. The Moscow Chamber Opera play it like a black farce; Pokrovsky's
production leaves the whole cast on stage sitting on benches to watch the
unlikely events unfold, turns it into a communal ritual. Watching it unfold
one quickly realises its importance to the participants.
Theatre Royal, Brighton; further performance of The Nose tomorrow

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: The Monarch in Madrid - The Victorian art exhibition
visiting the Prado
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIAL MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer, 'The Monarch of the Glen' is not in its offical home at the
headquarters of United Distillers in Edinburgh. Landseer's immortal image of
a stag in its Highland fastness is now casting its spell over a new public.
Together with Frith's 'Railway Station', a close competitor for title of
Most Famous Victorian Painting, the Monarch is now in Madrid with the
British Council's exhibition, Victorian Paintings from Turner to Whistler.
This enjoyable survey contains more than a hundred paintings and several
drawings by a great number of artists. They have been lent from the royal
collection and from public collections in some remarkably obscure corners of
the British Isles, as well as by numerous private collectors. The Prado's
civilised exhibition space is its last stop (ends July 31). As a great plus,
there is a small exhibition of Victorian photographs of great quality which
complement the paintings beautifully.
In its first fortnight the show has drawn a large attendance of Madrilenans.
The hope is that Victorian Paintings will fill what may well be a very
substantial gap in many visitors' knowledge of art. Victorian painting is
almost unknown in Spanish public collections. (Let us remember, however,
that the reverse is just as true.) The Prado owns barely half a dozen
19th-century Victorian paintings, the most recently acquired being a superb
evocation by David Roberts of the interior of the great mosque in Cordoba.
Last century and this, Spanish private collectors held off the Victorians.
In the homes of the aristocracy, there are the same kind of English hunting
and horsey paintings which are to be found the world over. However, this
exhibition marks Spain's first encounter with the strand of mid-century
narrative paintings such as Abraham Solomon's 'Contrast' (the rude health of
French fisherfolk on the beach contrasted with the consumptive young
Englishwoman sketching them with a limp hand in her bathchair) and Egley's
'Omnibus Life in London'.
The Prado will therefore also be a first time many visitors will have
encountered the Pre-Raphaelites. The leaders of the Brotherhood come out of
the show rather poorly. However, the later generation of the PRB is strongly
represented. 'Isabel' by the little-known John Melhush Strudwick, and John
William Waterhouse's 'Belle Dame Sans Merci' (his most famous work is the
Tate's 'Ophelia'), almost take us to the end of the century. In the latter,
we see how much English artists had come to admire the technique of Jules
Bastien Lepage.
Something which may surprise any visitor brought up on cliches about
Victorian morality is the Pre-Raphaelites' intensely eroticised view of
women. Rosetti's 'Blue Bower' from the Barber Institute uses vibrant colours
and also the beloved 'language of flowers' to express sheer lust. His
flame-haired model, Fanny Cornforth, is bowered by passion-flowers and
morning-glory as symbols of the artist's infatuation. Strewn corn-flowers
are her emblem.
More suggestive still, to the point of being comical, is the drawing of
'Proud Maisie' by Frederick Sandys. His mistress is in profile, the hair
cascading over her shoulders drawn with a scrupulosity which recalls
Leonardo's sketches of water. Sandys' mistress bites a strand of hair and
frowns, a petulant and predatory young woman who alerts us to the later
century's growing alarm in the face of discoveries about the unstable,
disorderly female psyche.
The Aesthetic Movement and the British Realist School are well shown. Frank
Holl's 'Gone', a study of emigrants at the Liverpool docks, was a painting
which strongly impressed the young Van Gogh. However, the latest painting to
be included is Sargent's portrait of the Sitwell family, Sir George and Lady
Sitwell with their famous children, Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell. It is a
fitting note on which to end. For one thing, Sargent loved Velazquez and
learned much from him about the full-length portrait. Then again, this is a
picture which testifies to the continuity of English upper-class life and
taste between the mid-century and the eve of the First World War. But
Sargent has also painted the young coming generation which was savagely to
deride and destroy so much that the Victorian era held to be true and
important.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: Detecting images through the smoke - Worth

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A thermal imaging sensor, which could help firemen to find casualties in
burning buildings, has won the Prince of Wales Award for Innovation for
GEC-Marconi Avionics.
Thermal imagers produce a picture by measuring radiation in the infra-red,
rather than the visible light spectrum and so can 'see' through dense smoke.
The GEC-Marconi breakthrough was to develop a detector which did not need
cooling. The company uses a ceramic detector chip.
The sensor can be built into a camera or the visor of a fire-fighter's
helmet. Gec-Marconi: UK, 0634 827332.

A drawback of hot, sunny weather is the stifling heat that builds up inside
parked vehicles. The answer may be a cooling spray which, claim
manufacturers France Med, of London, can reduce the temperature by as much
as 40`C almost instantaneously.
Magicool is a combination of water, fragrance and a chemical coolant. The
latter cools the surfaces while the water evaporates and reduces the air
temperature. As the coolant is approved for cosmetic use, Magicool can also
be sprayed on the skin.

Bates, which has drawn up a profile of the 'techthusiast' - technology
enthusiasts who are the first to buy new products.
According to the researchers there are 37m techthusiasts in the US alone,
with an average age of 38.2 years.
They read more newspapers and magazines, are prosperous, with a median
household income of Dollars 56,500 (Pounds 36,700), and are spread
throughout the US, although many congregate around leading universities and
technology companies. The analysis is part of BSB Projections 2002, issued

Every customer knows the frustration of calling a supplier only to be passed
from person to person, repeating the inquiry or complaint, until the right
person is reached.
Envoy, of Richmond, Surrey, has developed software so that customer details
can be transferred automatically with the telephone call.
If a customer calls his or her insurance company with a policy inquiry the
agent will call up details of the policy from the database on to the
computer screen. If the call needs to be transferred, the operator will call
the number and transfer the call and the data on the screen simultaneously.
In addition to the specialist software, the company needs a single link to
be installed between the main computer and the internal phone system.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There could hardly be two more contrasting tasks than selling products from
the rock-solid Prudential and marketing products for Invesco MIM, with its
racy past and battered reputation. But Alan Wren, who joins Invesco on
Tuesday as managing director of the UK retail division, reckons he is equal
to the challenge.
Acknowledging the UK end of the business is 'at its nadir', Wren, 43, is
attracted by the 'breadth of responsibility'. He will take charge of UK
retail activities, adding investment trusts and private clients to unit
trusts and PEPs.
Old MIM hands, complain at the clash between the old institution and the
ways of the highly successful US side, run by chairman Charles Brady. But
Wren sees the 'massive' business in the US, and the growing Far Eastern
presence, as plus factors.
The past will take time to live down - 'two years, maybe even longer', he
agrees. His priority is 'to introduce a customer, not a product, focus.'
While Invesco may seem many miles from the Pru, Wren says the problem of a
proliferation of products - 34 different units trusts valued at only Pounds
1.1bn, for instance - is one with which he is familiar.
Wren left the Pru, where he was managing director of the investment products
division, last November. After a successful first three years to 1987, sales
tailed off, investment performance went off the boil, and his plans for
European expansion were rejected.
Ronald Artus, Sir Victor Garland, and Sir Colin Southgate, all non-executive
directors, retired from the board of Prudential Corporation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas has appointed Harry Moulson to head its national transmission
system - the pipelines network - when Donald Young retires in July. The
appointment places a 49-year old high-flier, who has been groomed for the
top at British Gas, into a crucial post in the run-up to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission's report on the company.
The commission's report is due by the end of July and could leave Moulson
heading a separate company. One of the key decisions the commission must
make is whether British Gas's pipelines division should be hived off as a
separate entity. Even if this does not happen, Moulson will still have to
erect a Chinese wall between pipelines and the company's marketing business
 -along lines that British Gas has already agreed with regulators.
Moulson's background is in marketing in British Gas's regional offices and,
more recently, at headquarters. Before that, he was chairman of British Gas
Wales.

FT  28 MAY 93 / People: Marshall begins to reshape British Airways board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Colin Marshall, who took over as chairman of British Airways in
February, has started to reshape his board of directors by appointing a
couple of fellow Midland Bank directors to his own board.
Baroness O'Cathain, 55, managing director of London's Barbican Centre,
(pictured left) becomes the first woman on the BA board. She is joined by
Charles Mackay, 53, chief executive of Inchcape (pictured right). The
appointments are the first to be made since the furore caused by Virgin
Atlantic's allegations that BA was conducting a 'dirty tricks' against it.
The Virgin Atlantic row precipitated the early retirement of Lord King, Sir
Colin's predecessor, and there had been concern in some quarters of the City
that the BA board had not been as effective as it might have been in
monitoring the actions of BA's executives. Several of the non-executives are
friends of Lord King and there was a feeling that the board needed to be
strengthened by the appointment of some more independent outsiders.
The appointment of two new non-executive directors will go some way towards
meeting these concerns and will mean that non-executives will be in a
majority on the BA board.
Detta O'Cathain is a successful business woman, who also sits on the boards
of Tesco and Sears. Charles Mackay is well respected in the City and has
strong connections in the Far East. Baroness O'Cathain said yesterday that
the airline business had always been in her blood. She started her career as
an accounts clerk with Aer Lingus and her husband, William Bishop, used to
work for the Irish airline.
She announced yesterday that she had resigned from the board of Midland Bank
where she had been a director for 9 years.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: A new look at IT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who follows the information technology business in Europe knows how
complex, contradictory and statistically challenging it can be.
In an enterprising attempt to bring together all the important data about
European computer and telecommunications hardware, software and services,
the European Commission, in conjunction with the manufacturers'
organisation, Eurobit and the trade fairs CeBIT Hanover, SIMO Madrid and
SMAU Milan, have collated the European Information Technology Observatory
1993*, 275 pages of trends, views and figures.
The introductory view from the commission is by Michel Carpentier, the EC
director general with responsibility for IT, who argues for a long-term plan
of industrial objectives which could be met through a simplified and
enlightened approach to research and development.
Bruno Lamborghini of Olivetti, president of Eurobit, gives an industry view,
arguing for open markets and fair treatment: 'The IT market should be a
truly global endeavour' he writes, 'characterised by a high level of
international labour mobility. Therefore the IT industry must have unlimited
access under fair trade conditions to any market. Subsidies do not improve
competitiveness.'
Analysing the present state of the European market, the Observatory
concludes that although the immediate future may not look bright, there is
enormous potential.
There is instability and discontinuity because of the economic recession and
fierce price competition. On the other hand, the European market has an
advantage over the US because it is less saturated: 'This means that Europe
can enjoy a significantly higher growth rate over the next 10 years before
it reaches a level of saturation similar to that of the US. This is an
opportunity not to be missed by the European IT industry and European
entrepreneurs.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: From submarines to samovars - Russian military
contractors are diversifying to attract western business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life at the St Petersburg Marine Engineering Bureau is hard these days.
Twenty years ago the nuclear submarine builder was a power house of Soviet
military-economic development. Today it is touting for business in the west,
offering to build anything from underwater tourist vehicles to luxury
yachts.
The conversion from military submarine maker to civilian ship builder has
not been easy, complains Vladimir Barantsev, chief designer at the Bureau.
But change the Bureau must.
Barantsev misses the funding and government assistance which the Bureau used
to enjoy. All new customers have to be found by the organisation itself, he
says. The biggest problem is lack of funds.
At the Bureau's stand at the Conversion '93 exhibition in Birmingham this
week, the first significant exhibition of Russian military technology in
western Europe, Barantsev's dilemma is clear. The centre piece is a scale
model of a 30,000 tonne underwater supertanker, which would cost Dollars
200m (Pounds 130m) to build; a bargain by US or western European standards.
Barantsev simply does not have the cash.
'The customer is ready to buy the finished product but he is afraid to pay
for the production,' he says. 'We haven't got enough money for the
construction.'
Barantsev has had some success diversifying into non-military craft. Until
1987, only 10 per cent of the Bureau's turnover came from civilian projects,
mainly in the Soviet oil, gas and fishing industries. Now that figure is up
to 35 per cent, but the customers are still in the same sectors and almost
entirely within Russia.
The submersible tanker plan also relies largely on the proposed exploitation
of oil and gas fields off Russia's Arctic coast, where extreme conditions
would crack pipelines and ice prevents year-round exploitation by surface
tankers. Barantsev hopes some large private-sector company in Europe or the
US will fund the tanker, possibly as part of an oil exploration package.
In the short term, Barantsev's best hope lies in glass-sided submersible
crafts, for theme parks or seaside resorts. He stresses that the Bureau has
developed, and can make and sell, the submarine's contents, from the radar
to the first-aid kit. 'People have to work there, eat there and rest there,'
he says.
The St Petersburg Marine Engineering Bureau is not alone in selecting
low-technology products as a means of making its way in the new Russian
economy. The maker of Kalashnikov rifles has now turned its skills to
hunting rifles, the wooden handles engraved and inlaid. And the Vavilov
State Optical Institute has adapted its expertise in laser technology for
engraving crystal tableware.
The Institute is famous for its holography techniques, and has demonstrated
the world's largest colour hologram, which can be reconstructed using a
single incoherent light source - a white spot light. Other techniques rely
on coherent light sources - lasers - for their reconstruction.
Victor Puchkov, general director, believes the large colour holograms may
replace traditional travelling art exhibitions, where priceless exhibits
have to be moved from country to country under tight security.
But Puchkov is reluctant to talk about the possibility of bringing images of
Russian art treasures to a wider audience. Like Barantsev, he cites the
financial difficulties.
Elsewhere at Birmingham were even more bizarre examples of diversification.
Many stands featured decorated teapots and other bric-a-brac more
reminiscent of a country craft fair than a high-technology exhibition.
The aviation industry stand boasted clocks, samovars, and fridge freezers.
One defence company has applied expertise in optical fibre technology to
produce floral ornaments with rigid fabric petals which twinkle colourfully
when connected to the electricity supply.
With the domestic goods were established examples of military technology
spin-offs: such as tennis racquets made from carbon fibres. Bullet-proof
glass had also been moulded to make gemlike multicoloured rust-proof glass
nails.
There were examples of truly innovative technology. The Ekranoplan, a cross
between an aircraft and a Hovercraft, the Russians hope to sell as an
air-sea rescue aircraft or airborne ambulance.
Converting expensive, sophisticated military technology for equally
sophisticated use in peace time is a task which appears to have largely
foxed the Russians as it has companies in the US and Europe.
Yurii Krasnoshchyokov, director of the Central Research Institute of
Chemistry and Mechanics, and an explosives expert, is the exception.
'Everybody tries to run away from explosives, but we try to use them,' he
explains.
He has developed explosive 'bombs' which can be dropped from the air to
control avalanches. Another technique uses small, controlled explosions to
break up parched and furrowed agricultural land and so increase crop yields.
Most impressive of all has been the production of large diamond-like
superhard materials for use in industrial applications. The process involves
high temperatures and pressures to form boron nitride crystals. The pressure
is twofold: static and explosive; hence the diversification from
Krasnoshchyokov's original speciality.
The diversification, he says, is one of the most difficult attained by
Russian scientists. His eyes gleam with pleasure as he explains that one day
he hopes to produce superhard materials with the same aesthetic qualities -
and the same structural properties - as natural diamonds.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Management: Flying in the face of tradition - Companies have
intensified the search for cheaper executive travel. Danny Green outlines a
new option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANNY GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your staff want to fly business or first class. They insist they need the
extra space to work so that they can arrive fresh for that vital business
meeting. What is more, they want to take every trip on the same airline to
earn frequent flyer points.
Yet your company's margins are tight and there is a board edict to save
money. How can you keep your executives motivated, but retain a grip on the
cost of business air travel?
The problem is not new, but now the hunt for better travel management has
spawned an approach which is based on fees rather than on commissions. The
appearance of this approach has divided the ranks of the corporate travel
managers into the bold and the sceptical.
The traditional pattern has been for companies to engage travel agents to
buy airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms and rent cars. The agents recoup
the cost of running their businesses through commissions from airlines,
hotels and car rental agencies. The standard rate for airlines, for example,
is 9 per cent of the cost of a ticket.
The disadvantage with this approach is that travel agents have little
incentive to search for cut-price tickets. Saving money for clients cuts
their commission.
Companies and travel agents have tried to overcome this by arranging split
commissions, or by rebates for bulk purchases of tickets.
Typically, the client company might get back one third of the commission
from the agent, or 10 per cent of the ticket price from the airline, as a
reward for putting a lot of its business through one agent or airline.
These changes, however, do not adequately encourage agents to save their
clients money, says John Cash, manager purchasing, fleet/travel, for Rank
Xerox.
He has turned instead to an alternative based on management fees.
The principle is that the client pays the agent a fixed fee, with a bonus
based on savings above a pre-set target. The commission is split between the
two parties by arrangement.
Rank Xerox is using Thomas Cook, although similar fee-based deals can be
arranged with other large agencies including American Express, Hogg Robinson
and Wagons-lits.
Thomas Cook claims that savings of up to 40 per cent on tickets are possible
and practices 'open book' accounting in which the client sees where the
agency earns its money.
Cash is pleased by the results so far.
'A management fee brings more focus and dedicated support from the agent to
incentivise them to save you money.'
Agents are keen to push the idea further.
Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Wagons-lits, explains that agencies
are suffering as business travellers seek cheaper tickets.
'The travel agent still has to have the same level of service but the
(commission-based) margin is being very much diminished. The management fee
approach allows open book accounting: the client knows he's getting
everything he can get.'
The system is not without its reasoned opponents. The airlines, which are
mostly losing money, do not like it. By persuading companies to spend less
on air travel, management fees reduce the size of the whole cake, says
Stephen Wolf, head of United Airlines, the second biggest US carrier.
Some clients do not like it either. Dennis Campbell, travel and catering
manager at Esso Petroleum, says: 'Management fees can be inflexible. You
could spend more time arguing with your agent on who's doing what work.'
'You end up discussing terms with the travel agent for extra work.'
Campbell often deals with airlines directly using the travel agent for
market intelligence and advice.
'The name of the game nowadays is management information, building up
patterns of destinations,' he says.
He can use information, for example, that the London-Houston flight is
emptier on Tuesdays and Thursdays than on other days: 'We are working with
airlines on pushing business to slack days.'
In spite of this kind of resistance to replacing commissions with fees, the
notion is now spreading beyond the UK to the rest of Europe.
Wagons-lits already has a handful of fee-based clients on the continent,
especially in France.
The trend may have been given extra momentum by airline industry
deregulation, which began in earnest in Europe on January 1, 1993.
That is already increasing the number of discount fares on offer: as a
result, finding the cheapest deal is becoming more complex than ever.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Management: Tough act to copy - Barry Romeril is leaving BT
to head Xerox finance. Lucy Kellaway talks to him about achievement and
style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Romeril is not yet 50. Quickly and with little fuss he has risen up
and out of ICI and BTR to become one of the most powerful people in one of
Britain's biggest companies. He was made finance director of BT five years
ago, and now, despairing of the log jam on the way to the very top of that
company, is trying his luck across the Atlantic. At the end of next month he
becomes chief financial officer of Xerox Corporation.
It is still almost unheard of for a US company to parachute a foreigner into
a senior position. Companies such as Morgan Guaranty, and Philip Morris have
been run by British executives, but most of these have worked their way up
in the US and become naturalised citizens. Romeril, by comparison, was
approached by a US head hunter.
Insiders at BT speculate that Romeril's nose was put out of joint by the
appointment in 1991 of the equally youthful Michael Hepher as managing
director, a position which Romeril would have liked for himself. They also
refer to the appetite for creative tension of BT's chairman Ian Valance:
Romeril was meant to report to him, yet to support Hepher.
They also question whether the move counts as promotion. After all BT, which
is a larger company, faces increasingly exciting challanges as its old
monopoly position is undermined and as it ventures into new businesses and
areas.
In conversation, Romeril keeps his cards more or less glued to his chest,
and brushes aside such speculation. 'I was tempted by the fact that it was
in the US and that the job itself was more than interesting', he says. So he
took it, simple as that.
On the face of it, Romeril might seem a surprising choice for Xerox. Direct
almost to the point of being blunt, he is also low-profile. While Xerox is
known for its enthusiastic espousal of the latest in management fashions -
it was an early convert to total quality management, to benchmarking, and is
now leading the way in creating small-is-beautiful organisations - Romeril
is a graduate of the no-nonsense school of management. A colleague tells the
story that when asked to recite BT's four core values - which employees are
meant to eat for breakfast with their cornflakes - he could not name one.
'People who spend a lot of time reading management books may not be good
managers', he says. 'The guts of management is about common sense.
Excellence comes - as Owen Green (of BTR) once said - in making ordinary
people do extraordinary things'.
Despite a certain lack of charisma, Romeril has left a large imprint on BT's
corporate culture. He is seen in the City as a formidable cutter of costs,
although perhaps a little lacking in vision. However, insiders argue that
this understates his contribution. 'Barry taught everyone that they must
always consider the financial impact of every sale, which was a revelation
to some people. Valance, as a GPO man, always wanted to build wonderful new
networks from scratch. Barry convinced him that, by tweaking the existing
network, almost the same result could be obtained, at a fraction of the
cost,' says one colleague. Romeril agrees that he has helped change the way
the company thinks. 'Too many decisions were made on the basis that him up
there wants it. What I have sought to do is bring a commercial attitude to
the way the company approaches its business.'
In so doing, he has raised the status of his job. 'My style of being a
finance director is to be very much involved in business decisions', he
says, arguing that accounting and fundraising are more a specialist part of
the job than its very core.
Romeril is regarded by some as a hatchet man: he was involved in the mass
lay offs at ICI in the early 1980s as well as the present wave of
redundancies at BT. About job losses he is unsentimental, verging on the
unsympathetic. 'You would be surprised at the number of people who left with
generous or fairly generous terms, who said later that it was the best thing
that had ever happened to them,' he says.
Romeril's general approach to business may make him more at home in the US -
where he has spent much time for all of his three employers - than in the
UK. He is an advocate of the US attitude that says tomorrow is the first day
of the rest of my life, and the 'can do' mentality. 'Over here, managers are
inclined to slip into a more discursive and debating approach. I believe
that in management you make up your mind what you want to do. Once the
decision has been made, you go, do. Too much management time in Britain is
spent revisiting decisions'.
Would he still make that criticism of BT? Romeril hesitates, and then says
that, although the tendency is there, it is less strong than it used to be.
At Xerox, Romeril's function is to remain broad: he is to be in charge of
business strategy and business development as well as finance. He is
undaunted by the fact that the copier market is unknown to him. In any case,
he is used to making career changes, and cites his own breadth of experience
as part of his strength. 'The variety gives one a better nose for the
fallacious argument or for the manager who is most likely to succeed.'
The money at Xerox will also be better. His base salary will be about the
same, but he will have the rich menu of performance-related stock
incentives, options, and bonus schemes to which US executives have become
accustomed.
Does he fear that as a foreigner in a US corporation his progress will be
stopped by a glass ceiling? Absolutely not: 'Xerox is a truly multinational
company which wants to reflect in its mangement appointments the nature and
diversity of its business.'
Romeril is ambitious, and sees no virtue in trying to hide the fact.
'Responsibility at middle and senior levels is as much taken as given', he
says. 'If you wait to be told what to do, you'll never reach the top.'
He suggests that one area in which people should take on responsibility is
to criticise others, and if they make enemies in doing so that is
inevitable. 'No one can get to the top on a universally friendly pattern',
he says, shrugging.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Property Market: Building bridges - A forum designed to
foster a better understanding of property finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week sees the formal launch of the Association of Property Bankers, a
new group set up to consider and promote issues involved in property
lending.
The origins of the association date back to December 1991 when a handful of
property bankers decided to pool their views and lobby on issues such as
environmental legislation and property valuations.
The APB is embarking on a series of meetings and talks, which start next
week with a lecture by Mr Pen Kent, a director of the Bank of England, about
the future of property finance. The aim is to 'foster a better understanding
of property finance and its techniques among all those interested in
commercial property finance'.
'We are trying to form a bridge between the property and banking worlds,'
said Mr Richard Lovell, manager of property finance at the Industrial Bank
of Japan and the association's president. 'We are trying to develop a
philosophy of good property banking.'
Any consideration of these issues is likely to involve an examination of
what went wrong in the late 1980s - the spectacular increase in bank lending
to the UK property industry, which fuelled runaway increases in property
prices and a period of buoyant building.
Even with hindsight, the answers to these questions are not straightforward.
Bankers' assessments of the industry's collective mistakes include the
following:
Too much money flooded into the property market and the taps were not turned
off soon enough. The number of banks lending to property expanded from about
20 to some 150 throughout the 1980s, largely the result of financial
deregulation in the UK; the globalisation of the banking sector; and the
banks' loss of large corporate business to the commercial paper and bond
markets.
The result of this intense competition was that banks took increased risks
on poorer quality business, at the same time as lending margins narrowed.
According to Mr Lovell, there is a need for a clearer appreciation of risk.
'If risk is being incorrectly priced you should step out of the market,' he
said.
Bankers were not sufficiently aware of the extent of lending to particular
parts of the market. Although bankers are aware of their immediate
competitors and the overall statistics for property lending, they do not
have the means to analyse lending to particular markets or sub-markets.
Bankers were misled by the large demand for their loans and not sufficiently
concerned about how their loans would be repaid. The fact that institutions
had become disillusioned with property and were unwilling to buy new
developments on completion was not considered thoroughly.
Bankers were frequently willing to lend on generous terms even when the
developments were in fringe areas with little certainty of attracting
tenants. 'In any other area of business where you had risks of that
magnitude, they would be financed by equity,' said Mr Morris of CIBC.
The traditional formula for property lending, whereby the ratio of loan to
equity was typically 70:30, was often relaxed, sometimes to a point where
banks were prepared to lend the total value of a project.
Some critics argue that this approach to lending is fundamentally flawed.
Bankers overemphasised the importance of an asset's value, instead of
concentrating on income flow and the financial security of a tenant's
covenant.
'Everybody thought that bricks and concrete had an intrinsic value,' said Mr
Graham Morris, of CIBC, the Canadian Bank, and APB's treasurer. 'What we
lost sight of was that the real fount of value for property relies on cash
flow.'
Commercial mortgage indemnities, in which banks insured against falling
property values, were wrongly considered to be a guarantee against loans
turning sour. Some lenders eventually discovered problems in the small
print; others found they would only get paid when the property was sold. But
this has proved difficult given the state of the market.
Bankers increased their risks by lending against individual properties,
sometimes on a non-recourse basis which gave them no redress to the parent
company if the project failed to meet early expectations. Some bankers
criticise this practice in the belief that lending to individual properties
is inherently risky; banks should reduce their risk by lending to companies
which own a portfolio of properties.
Bankers sometimes exhibited an overly simplistic approach to analysing the
property market. Bankers were too reliant on property valuations, which are
merely snap-shots of value at a particular time, and failed to adequately
assess the prospects for a property over several years.
Likewise, banks tend to be attracted to property lending when the market is
relatively straightforward. Since this is usually when values are rising
strongly, it can prove a dangerous time to lend.
Bankers are rarely prepared to take a counter-cyclical approach to property
lending. Most appear to make loans in the upswing of the property cycle and
withdraw when the market is near the bottom. Most banks have withdrawn from
property lending in the past few years. An estimated 40 banks remain and
these tend to be highly conservative in their lending policy.
Part of the reason for the banks' withdrawal from property lending is that
they are under pressure to meet international standards on capital adequacy.
But an equally important factor is that banks still suffer from deep
psychological scars from the huge losses they incurred on property lending.
'We have been shell-shocked by the enormity of the problems that have hit
us,' said Mr Morris.
As the postmortem of the 1989-93 property crash gets under way, several
lessons will doubtless emerge. But it is salutary to recall that bankers of
the late-1970s also thought they had learned from the property crash earlier
in that decade and that those mistakes would not be repeated. History may
not repeat itself, but it would be rash to think that property booms and
busts are a thing of the past.
This point is accepted by the founders of the APB. 'We know the property
market is a cyclical business. We don't think we can apply an iron to the
cycles and say no more cycles,' said Mr Morris.
Mr Lovell agrees: 'We are nowhere near arrogant enough to think we can
prevent another crash.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Property Market: More hopeful signs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property market showed further signs of tentative recovery in
April, with the All Properties total return reaching 0.6 per cent for the
month, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group.
Although rental values continued to fall, yields fell slightly in all
sectors, offering perhaps the first real sign of improved investor
confidence, it said.
The All Properties equivalent yield shifted by 0.04 per cent to 10 per cent.
Capital values dropped by 0.2 percentage points, the lowest monthly fall
this year.
The year-on-year measures showed ever declining rental values but slowly
improving capital values. Rental value growth for the year to April dropped
to -10.3 per cent from -9.8 per cent, while the rate of capital depreciation
was cut by 0.3 per cent of a point to -7.7 per cent.
The retail sector was the best performing sector in April, with a 0.7 per
cent return. Capital values stabilised despite the continued decline in shop
rental values.
The office sector return was unchanged at 0.5 per cent. Yields shortened by
more than half a percentage point to 10.3 per cent. The industrial sector
suffered a -1.5 per cent decline in rental values.

FT  28 MAY 93 / BA in talks to avert strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS flights are expected to operate normally this weekend in
spite of a vote yesterday by the company's cabin crew and ground staff in
favour of a strike, writes Robert Taylor.
The TGWU general union said 'no hasty decisions' would be taken and there
was no 'gung-ho mood'. Talks were continuing with BA in an attempt to
resolve differences over alleged threats to cut pay and change employment
conditions in newly formed BA subsidiaries.
In a postal ballot with a turnout of only 51 per cent, 62 per cent of those
who voted backed the union's call for a strike. Industrial action short of a
strike was supported by 84 per cent.
BA said it was 'disappointed' at the ballot result, but added that the low
response showed there was 'no clear mandate for strike action'.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Insurers warn over terror costs 'panic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS COULD be on a collision course with the government over moves to
increase premium rates for terrorism insurance after last month's
Bishopsgate bomb.
The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association,
yesterday said the government was stepping up pressure on Pool Re, the new
government-backed reinsurer, to increase rates.
Describing any rise as 'premature' and warning against 'panic reaction', the
association said a rates review should be left until later this year.
The association believes higher rates will be offset by a diminishing
take-up by businesses of terrorist cover, undermining the effectiveness of
Pool Re. The Department of Trade and Industry said talks with industry were
continuing. 'The original rates were set at great speed,' it said.
A report by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consulting actuaries, submitted to Pool Re
this week, could form the basis for the change in rating. The report is
understood to recommend steep increases in rates for businesses based in
London. Some companies could face rate rises of 300 per cent. Those in safer
areas could benefit from reductions.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Bathing beauties caught for Dollars 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LAWRENCE Alma-Tadema's 'The Baths of Caracalla', one of the great
late-Victorian genre paintings, sold for Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.62m) at
Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday, a record price for the artist and way
above estimate.
Depicting three beauties against the backdrop of a scrupulous representation
of the ancient baths in Rome, it was the artist's favourite painting.
The sale was the highlight of a successful auction of 19th century art which
totalled Dollars 9.8m, with 78 per cent sold by value. Another artist to set
a record price was the Frenchman William Bouguereau, whose 1875 painting of
the Virgin with the Infant Jesus and St John sold for Dollars 690,000.
An auction of American pictures at Christie's brought in Dollars 10.5m, with
75 per cent sold. A bronze equestrian group by Frederic Remington of a
cavalryman wounded by Indians fetched Dollars 1.98m.
The growing international sweep of the art market was shown at auctions this
week in London, Dublin and Geneva as well as New York, while Christie's held
its first sale in Singapore, bringing in Pounds 1.3m (double the estimate)
from a collection of Thai stamps. Only one of the 364 lots was unsold.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Sunday trading bill to offer new option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to confirm today that it has added a fourth,
'middle ground' option to its draft bill on Sunday trading, which is due to
be published in the next few weeks.
The option is supported by some of the UK's largest retailers, including
Marks and Spencer, Burton and Gateway.
Home office minister Mr Peter Lloyd will tell the Commons that the bill will
include proposals from the Retailers for Shops Act Reform group, which wants
to remove Sunday opening curbs for food and convenience shops of less than
3,000 sq ft and for DIY shops and garden centres, with protection for
workers who refuse to work on Sundays. Under the RSAR proposals large shops
would be barred from opening on Sundays but all shops would be allowed to
open for the last four days before Christmas.
The inclusion of the reform group's proposals may exacerbate the rifts
between retailers on Sunday trading. Sainsbury and Tesco have denounced the
RSAR proposals as ignoring the wishes of customers.
The bill was previously expected to offer only three options, including
total deregulation.

A further 2,800 jobs were created in IDB companies which received financial

The board says the investment projects, which created 1,945 jobs, involved
investment of Pounds 168m with the IDB contributing Pounds 50m.

FT  28 MAY 93 / BBC to sample viewer opinions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC will send out more than 2m questionnaires each year to viewers in a
'rolling referendum' on its polices, programmes and performance.
The unprecedented sampling of the views of licence-payers is part of a move
towards greater openness and accountability at the corporation.
The BBC said the plan to seek the views of 10 per cent of the 20m-plus
licence-paying homes a year would be cost-effective because questionnaires
would be sent with licence-fee reminders.
Publishing its response to the government green paper on its future, the BBC
said panels of viewers would be convened to advise on policy and programme
strategy.
Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, said yesterday: 'We are not talking
about being enslaved by this process (of seeking viewers' opinions). It is
meant to inform our judgments and make better decisions.'
In its 154-page response to the government the BBC promised enhanced
accountability, including a clear definition of the role of the BBC
governors and the board of management, an improved complaints procedure and
a new commercial policy framework. Mr Birt said 57 meetings with
licence-payers throughout the UK had 'demonstrated substantial support for
and satisfaction with our existing output'. He described the BBC as 'one of
the most successful institutions created in any country in the twentieth
century'.
The BBC says the government should allow it to continue offering all the
services it does now under a new Royal Charter, but provided more
efficiently with greater openness and accountability.
A study by consultants McKinsey of 11 public-service broadcasters around the
world, published with the main BBC response, found that the licence fee was
potentially the most attractive method of funding to meet public-service
objectives.
Independent market research found 63 per cent in favour and only 14 per cent
against the BBC's preferred programme strategy - concentrating on a broad
range of quality programmes.
Only 24 per cent preferred a more narrow public-service option and 42 per
cent opposed the BBC competing with commercial broadcasters.
Sixty four per cent said the BBC licence fee at Pounds 80 a year was very
good or fairly good value for money, and 72 per cent were against reducing
the range or quality of programmes to cut the licence.
Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, said this week that he
hoped to produce a white paper on the future of the BBC 'at the turn of the
year'.

FT  28 MAY 93 / CBI forecasts manufacturing-led recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MANUFACTURING-led rec-overy which will gather strength later this year is
predicted today by the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI says manufacturers' order books have strengthened considerably
recently, with export orders showing particular growth due to greater
competitiveness caused by the pound's devaluation.
Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, warned that the big recent
weakening in demand among Britain's trading partners in continental Europe -
largely caused by the deepening German recession - remained a threat to a
sustained upturn.
While the CBI is slightly more bullish about recovery, it says consumer and
industry demand remains weak.
In particular, stocks of finished goods in factory warehouses are fairly
high, indicating that any extra sales of manufactured products may take some
time to spark busier production lines.
In its latest quarterly forecast the CBI says gross domestic product will
increase 1.6 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year. In its previous
forecast, in March, it said the figures would be 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per
cent.
Manufacturing output is expected to increase by a respectable 3 per cent
this year, helped by the effects of devaluation, higher productivity and
sluggish wage growth.
In its monthly survey of the commercial outlook facing manufacturers, the
CBI found that order books are at their highest levels for three years and
expectations about output more optimistic than at any time since February
1989.
The CBI says, however, that order books are still rated as 'below normal' by
36 per cent of businesses, with 14 per cent saying they are above normal.
Views about output are more positive, with 37 per cent of companies
expecting sales volumes to increase in the next four months, and only 14 per
cent expecting a decline.
Another finding from the monthly survey, conducted among 1,545 companies
between April 27 and May 19, is that three out of four manufacturers expect
their prices to remain unchanged in the next four months, indicating muted
inflationary pressures.
The CBI is fairly optimistic about inflation, reckoning that annual growth
in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments, will be below the
Treasury's 4 per cent target until at least the end of 1994.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Howard is gift to grassroots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard is a home secretary to hearten Tory grassroots supporters,
at a time when they feel under siege on what should be the party's strongest
ground.
Their only reservation about the combative, articulate right-winger - who
favours capital punishment - is likely to be that he is a clever lawyer.
For Mr Howard the Home Office is a consolation prize for not becoming
chancellor, but still a promotion to responsibilities in which he has long
expressed an interest, when the government is seeking to regain the
initiative on law and order.
His ability to take on the opposition will be highly prized by Tories
dismayed by Labour's effective 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of
crime' campaign earlier this year.
His emphasis on Labour's employment policies in the approach to last year's
election revealed him as a formidable if not a sympathetic campaigner.
Against Mr Tony Blair, once more his opposite number, he highlighted the
opposition's union links and the number of jobs at risk from the social
charter and minimum wage.
The main political charge laid against Mr Howard is that he lacks passion
and conviction, instead arguing whatever brief he has been given - like the
experienced QC he is.
His supporters indignantly deny this, saying he is the most Euro-sceptic
minister in the cabinet and a strong believer in free enterprise and low
taxation.
An aide said: 'Were it not for some of Thatcher's recent outbursts, I'm sure
he would be pleased to call himself a Thatcherite.'
He entered the Commons for the relatively safe seat of Folkestone and Hythe
in 1983, several years after his 'Cambridge mafia' contemporaries  - Mr
Norman Lamont, Mr John Gummer and Mr Kenneth Clarke.
In the years before his election, after fighting the safe Labour seat of
Liverpool Edge Hill in 1966 and 1970, he turned to developing a successful
legal practice specialising in planning and employment cases. Mr Howard made
up for lost time within two years of becoming an MP.
He became a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry,
responsible for taking the complicated and technical financial services
legislation through the Commons. His reward was promotion to the Department
of the Environment after the 1987 election.
He presided over the passage of the poll tax legislation; privatised the
water industry; and then became employment secretary as unemployment started
to rise.
His advisers suggest that he will want to build a close and co-operative
relationship with the police. A tough crime policy and a more satisfied
police service would leave the Tory party in the country well-pleased with
Mr Howard's appointment.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Gummer shows survival knack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER'S promotion to environment secretary from agriculture
minister shows his capacity for political survival. Party chairman from 1983
to 1985, he had seemed consigned to a series of low-profile jobs in the
Treasury, local government and agriculture.
The move demonstrates his place as one of Mr John Major's political cronies
and part of the 'East Anglia Mafia' - his Suffolk coastal constituency is
close to Mr Major's, and he co-proposed Mr Major for prime minister.
While environmental groups accuse Mr Gummer of having maintained an 'uneasy
silence' on controversial issues such as river pollution, he claimed last
year to be Europe's greenest agriculture minister.
A fluent orator, he has a reputation for easily summoned indignation and for
anti-permissive instincts - he quit the Church of England's general synod
last year in protest at women priests.
But he is known as an enthusiast, not a deep thinker. Mr Chris Smith, shadow
environment secretary said: 'Gummer is a disastrously lightweight
appointment - he will lack seriousness of purpose and lack clout in the
cabinet.'
Mr Gummer's move shows that the environment portfolio is low on the
political agenda now that the council tax appears to have bedded down.
He inherits tricky problems, however, particularly whether to approve
British Nuclear Fuels' controversial Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said last night the issue would be a
litmus test of his environmental credibility.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Tough operator a natural for No 11
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENNETH CLARKE chose himself. Once the pressure for Mr Norman Lamont's
departure from Number 11 Downing Street became irresistible, Mr John Major
had little choice but to call for the confident, combative and brash MP for
Rushcliffe. The toughest job in the government demanded the government's
toughest operator.
At 52, Mr Clarke has emerged - Mr Douglas Hurd aside - as the strongest
member of the cabinet. During the days of crisis following sterling's
ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism, he was the one asked to
tour the television studios to persuade a doubting world that the government
would not disintegrate.
From that point onwards, inside as well as outside the government, he has
been the guardian of the cabinet's collective nerve. Never afraid to admit
his ambition to be prime minister or to confess the government was in a mess
 -he recently admitted the government was in a 'dreadful hole' - he has now
been anointed Mr Major's heir apparent.
Mr Major needs, above all, a credible economic policy. His government will
stand or fall on its ability to persuade a bruised and bitter electorate
that the pain of the recession will be followed by sustained economic
recovery.
Mr Clarke's elevation also offers the prospect of a pivotal and influential
partnership with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Mr Major's new industrial strategy, based on a partnership between
government and industry to boost Britain's competitiveness, was always going
to be inhibited by a less than totally convinced Treasury. Now, two
ministers in key departments are of like minds over the need to engage
government fully in the task of raising Britain's performance.
Mr Clarke's appointment will win wide applause across the centre and left of
the Tory party. But it is not without its risks. The new chancellor - a
self-proclaimed pro-European and a staunch believer in the value of managed
exchange rates - is deeply mistrusted by the recalcitrant Tory right.
With the government's supporters at Westminster deeply divided by the battle
over Maastricht, the right will demand guarantees - 'gold-plated' one said
yesterday - that Mr Clarke will not seek to return sterling to the ERM.
For the short-to-medium term, the new chancellor will be ready to reassure
them. He remains committed to the principle of a stable exchange rate and
believes Britain will not escape linking its currency to those of its
partners.
But he is politically astute enough to realise that the Tory party at
Westminster would be broken irrevocably by an early return to the ERM.
It was no accident that two weeks ago Mr Clarke said he saw little prospect
of the pound rejoining the system before the next general election. The
chancellor-in-waiting was reassuring the Conservative right.
Nor does his reputation as a 'one-nation' Conservative (he is a prominent
member of the Tory Reform Group) imply he will be soft on inflation, public
spending or borrowing. Despite expectations of a 'softer' edge at the
Treasury, Mr Clarke faces the same menu of unpalatable economic choices as
his hapless predecessor.
Like most of the generation of Tory politicians who could once be described
as 'wet', he has long since been persuaded that 'caring Conservatism' is
only possible if inflation is kept under control. Nor is he a conventional
centrist - as the trade unions who dealt with him at health, education and
the Home Office will attest.
His first act as chancellor, therefore, will be a re-affirmation of the
central policy objectives of containing inflation and of reducing the
borrowing requirement.
Close to the top of his agenda will be a decision on the vexed question of
whether to extend the 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay - something
he could well support.
Friends say the government's political credibility alone means there is no
prospect of any loosening of the public spending framework put in place by
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury.
Nor does Mr Clarke have great room for manoeuvre over taxation. The
increases announced by Mr Lamont in March would be impossible to reverse.
Mr Clarke will, however, re-examine all the remaining tax options before
November. And there might be a key difference with Mr Lamont. The new
chancellor's friends believe that if he considers the level of borrowing
still to be too high, the man who has religiously proclaimed the broader,
economic benefits of lower personal taxation would consider at least a
temporary rise in income tax.
He can be fast on his feet; witness his recent about-turn on unit fines,
performed with a stylish flourish admired by his backbenchers. His political
opponents call him arrogant, callous and patronising and point to a patchy
legacy which has failed to match the promise; his fans see a sharp mind and
an all-important common touch. Mr Clarke has wanted the Treasury since
sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM. Summoned to Admiralty House
to share in the decision to withdraw the pound (one person present commented
later that he had been asked 'to put his hands in the blood') he was
horrified at the way the core of the government's economic strategy was
being swept aside by the speculators. He told friends later that the
technicians - the Treasury mandarins - had taken charge as the politicians
stood by powerless. He was appalled when officials demanded that their
political masters simply 'sign on the dotted line'.
That reaction will be the key to the way he handles the Treasury. Above all
Mr Clarke is a political activist. 'All I ever do is apply policies and
principles which I believe are beneficial. The only thing that does a
politician any good is to make a success of the job', he has said. The
mandarins are in for a busy time.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Local election results sealed fate of
the 'scapegoat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS an edge of irritation in Mr John Major's voice earlier this week
when, sitting in his study at 10 Downing Street, he was pressed on Mr Norman
Lamont's future as chancellor.
During the rest of his hour-long interview with the FT on Monday the prime
minister was relaxed and affable. But his response to questions about
whether he was about to reshuffle the cabinet was sharp. He had no intention
of giving the media advance notice of changes. But Mr Major knew as he spoke
that Mr Lamont's days at the Treasury were numbered.
Mr Lamont's fate was sealed on the morning of May 7. As the Conservatives
reeled under the impact of defeats in Newbury and in the county council
elections, those in the prime minister's inner circle drew a damning
conclusion. As long as Mr Lamont stayed on as chancellor there was little
prospect of the government recovering its poise.
More significantly for Mr Major, the chancellor had become a personal
liability. With talk of a challenge to the prime minister in the autumn, he
could not afford to allow Mr Lamont to deliver the November Budget.
As party officials conducted an intensive post-mortem on the election
defeats one factor cropped up again and again. The most powerful weapon
deployed by the Liberal Democrats had been a simple slogan: Voting
Conservative is a vote of confidence in Norman Lamont.
The message was reinforced by an outcry from Conservative constituency
associations. Everywhere party chairman Sir Norman Fowler went he was told
that the party judged that the chancellor had become the focal point for
discontent. No-one would trust the government - nor have confidence in its
economic policies - as long as Mr Lamont was still there.
The conclusion conveyed to Mr Major by Sir Norman and by Mr Richard Ryder,
the chief whip, was that Mr Major's own position depended on him sacking the
man who had run his campaign for the party leadership two-and-a-half years
ago. Private soundings revealed that it was a judgment with which virtually
everyone in the cabinet concurred. And although Mr Lamont still had friends
on the back benches, the message was that they would not fight to keep him.
Mr Lamont thought otherwise. He spent the past two weeks fighting for his
political life - telling friends that he must not be made a scapegoat,
urging support from colleagues.
But the tide became unstoppable. A week ago the prime minister decided he
had to go.
Sir Norman was told at the weekend and spent the next few days in a series
of meetings with the prime minister planning the wider changes which would
accompany Mr Lamont's move. It was thought there was a chance that the
former chancellor would accept the indignity of a move to the department of
the environment. But the reshuffle was planned on the basis that he would
refuse.
The angry manner of Mr Lamont's departure yesterday was public testimony to
his belief that Mr Major had betrayed him. The implicit threat was that he
might now seek his revenge. His words from the back benches will be as
eagerly awaited as those of Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe in the
final days of the Thatcher era.
The message from Downing Street yesterday was that Mr Major had decided to
'refresh' his cabinet. It was true as far as it went.
But no one at Westminster doubted that all the changes were built around a
single aim - to put Mr Kenneth Clarke into the Treasury in time to halt the
fall in the government's popularity and to start preparations for November's
unified budget.
The reshuffle was done with political skill. Mr Major demonstrated his
authority by appointing Mr Clarke in spite of the fears on the Tory right
that he remains wedded to the European exchange rate mechanism and, more
generally, to a central role for Britain in the European Community.
The political balance came from Mr Michael Howard's elevation to the Home
Office. An instinctive right winger is now in charge of an issue that
Conservatives regard as second only in importance to the economy - law and
order.
Mr Howard is now the candidate of the right should Mr Major fall under
Westminster's No 11 bus. Mr John Redwood's elevation to the cabinet and the
choice of Mr David Heathcote-Amory for the European job at the foreign
office were designed to reinforce the same point - Mr Major is sensitive to
the political balance in his party.
Mr Major's hope is that the acrimony will fade, that the Tory right will
judge that there is a common interest in uniting around the new chancellor,
that Mr Clarke will start to persuade the electorate that the government
will sustain the economy recovery and that it has restored its grip.
The prime minister may prove correct. But he is aware of the dangers. There
have been broad hints from friends of Mr Lamont that if there were mistakes
made in the approach to sterling's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism, they were made by the prime minister. In the crude jargon of
Westminster, Mr Lamont knows where the bodies were buried. He might decide
to reveal them.
Mr Major's recovery depends on his new chancellor reaping the rewards of Mr
Lamont's Treasury stewardship.
If the recovery is sustained and inflation remains low, the restless right
of the Tory party may keep their counsel. Mr Lamont may choose discretion
over revenge. Friends believe that his reputation will be best served by
dignified silence.
But as Mr Major's ministers digested the events of yesterday few denied
there were still far too many 'ifs'. The scars left on the Tory party by the
war over Maastricht will not heal quickly.
Mr Major has dangerous and destructive enemies in his own party. He has
appointed to the most powerful job in his government his most likely
successor. What he needs now, above all else, is a run of political luck.
He had no choice but to sack his chancellor. But it offers no guarantee of
escape.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: An English patriot takes on Welsh
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL Tory rightwinger, an able and astute politician and, at heart,
a patriotic Englishman, Mr John Redwood's promotion yesterday to the cabinet
was unsurprising. But his appointment as Welsh secretary was, to say the
least, controversial.
Mr Redwood's elevation from local government minister - after just four
years in ministerial office - helps balance left and right in Mr John
Major's cabinet. Yet in the principality it threatens to reverse a decade of
government interventionism quite unlike the Tories' economic management
elsewhere.
Mr David Hunt, the departing Welsh secretary who was born in Wales and whose
Wirral constituency is at least nearby, was proud of his near-Keynesian
attempts at employment creation. His three years in the job were punctuated
almost daily by press notices on jobs created by Welsh Office initiatives.
But Mr Redwood, 41, is Conservative MP for Wokingham, a town linked to Wales
only by the M4 motorway. He is a crusader for populist capitalism, a former
head of the Number 10 policy unit under Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher,
and a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back Group.
Mr Dafydd Wigley, MP for Caernarfon and president of Plaid Cymru, said Mr
Redwood's appointment was 'ominous and ill-considered'.
Mr Redwood is not a believer in the paraphernalia of regional economic
development. His relationship with the Welsh Development Agency will be an
early marker of his style of stewardship. He will also preside over
reorganisation of Welsh local government.
Nor is Mr Redwood a natural European. Privately, he has described himself as
an English nationalist.
Last night Mr Redwood admitted he had no Welsh connections but said on BBC
radio: 'I have been a regular visitor to Wales.' He denied Labour protests
that he was a 'hatchet man' brought in to slash public spending in Wales.
Mr Hunt moves to the Department of Employment, where his presentational
skills will be tested as the government faces relentlessly high levels of
unemployment. He will be eager to develop the plethora of government schemes
for the jobless, although as a one-nation Tory he is unlikely to be keen on
the workfare schemes being floated by rightwing Tories.
Mrs Gillian Shephard moves from the employment department to agriculture. To
some at Westminster the step represented a demotion, but with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other trade issues on the political
agenda, her profile will remain high.
Three ministers were sacked by Mr Major after failing to impress government
business managers. Mr Edward Leigh, the Thatcherite junior minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior transport
minister, and Mr Robert Jackson, junior minister at the Office of Public
Service and Science.
Among those promoted were Mr William Hague, who was parliamentary private
secretary to Mr Lamont. He becomes a junior social security minister.
Rightwinger Miss Anne Widdecombe switches from the Department of Social
Security to the employment department where she may take responsibility for
womens' issues.

MR MICHAEL Howard is a home secretary to hearten Tory grassroots supporters,
at a time when they feel under siege in what should be the party's strongest

Euro-sceptic minister in the cabinet and is a strong believer in free

His reward was promotion to the Department of the Environment after the 1987
election.
He took through the poll tax legislation; privatised the water industry; and
then became employment secretary as unemployment began to rise. Colleagues
joked about the dangers of being so clever as to be the automatic choice for
unpleasant and difficult tasks.
Officials describe him as very demanding, able to absorb a vast amount of
material, but a bad delegator who lacks a close relationship with his junior
ministers. They admit, however, that he has worked hard with local
authorities to make the council tax a success.
His advisers suggest that he will hope to build a similarly close and
co-operative relationship with the police.
A tough crime policy and a more satisfied police service would leave the
Tory party in the country well-pleased with Mr Howard's appointment.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: PM's letter accepts Lamont's decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
10 DOWNING STREET
LONDON SW1A 2AA
THE PRIME MINISTER
Dear Norman,
I told you this morning that I had decided to make some changes to the
Government. I had hoped that you would feel able to remain as a senior
member of the Cabinet; but I respect and accept your decision not to stay
on. I believe the economic policies you have followed as Chancellor will be
seen to have created the conditions for renewed and sustainable economic
growth in this country.
You have served with distinction in successive Governments since 1979. You
have made a significant contribution to economic and financial policy, first
as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, then as Chief Secretary and since
1990 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. You steered through some of our major
privatisations. You have not hesitated to take difficult decisions on public
spending and you have presented three tax reforming budgets - including the
second one which did so much to help us win the last Election. You shared
with me an overriding objective as Chancellor to bring down inflation, and
you have succeeded in reducing it to its lowest rate for nearly 30 years.
That has been an outstanding achievement.
Norma joins me in sending our best wishes to you and to Rosemary who has
supported you wonderfully through a difficult time.
Yours Ever, John
The Right Honourable Norman Lamont, MP

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Treasury mandarins await new orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PETER MARSH and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE no tears and even some jokes as Mr Norman Lamont bade farewell
yesterday to his ministerial team and top aides at an impromptu party in his
Treasury office.
As mandarins sipped white wine and nibbled nuts and crisps, the Treasury
geared up for its first meeting today with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the first
chancellor since Lord Howe in 1979 to have had no experience as a Treasury
minister.
Treasury officials, accustomed to providing a barrage of briefing documents
during a change of government, were yesterday waiting to see what their new
chancellor would want before swinging into action.
However, beyond the unlovely Linoleum Palace overlooking Whitehall, some
commentators are already urging Mr Clarke to take a hard look at the
Treasury's techniques for devising economic policy and its relationship with
the outside world.
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, one of the 'seven wise
men' appointed earlier this year to advise the Treasury, said Mr Clarke
should 'turn the Treasury upside down' in a quest to learn from recent
policy mistakes.
These included the too-loose monetary policy that led to the late-1980s boom
and the 'disastrous' period of membership of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Mr Warwick Lightfoot, a former Treasury adviser to Mr Lamont and now a Royal
Bank of Scotland economist, said the new chancellor should 'rebuild'
economic policy by immediately pruning the budget deficit and reviewing the
mechanisms for setting interest rates.
A specific item some outsiders want Mr Clarke to examine is the relationship
between the Treasury and the Bank of England in monetary policy. Mr Keith
Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel, said Mr Clarke should
announce he will take more notice of the Bank in setting interest rates, a
move he said would strengthen the government's credibility with financial
markets.
Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasts at London Business
School, and another of the wise men advising the Treasury, warned that the
new Chancellor would have to take 'decisive action' against the budget
deficit, possibly by increasing taxes and cutting spending.
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, also a 'wise man', said he hoped Mr Clarke's would have better
'political skills' than the former chancellor.
Mr Peter Fellner, UK economist at NatWest Capital Markets, was among those
in the City unmoved by yesterday's events. He said: 'I can't see Kenneth
Clarke being any different from Norman Lamont. The chancellor might have
changed but the problems facing the country haven't'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor:
I have always been willing to be judged on my record.
John Smith, Labour leader:
Today's reshuffle is a panic measure by the prime minister, like a
captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as they head
for the rocks.
Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats:
This is just a new coat of paint for a discredited government.
John MacGregor, transport secretary:
I think Norman Lamont has had a pretty unfair treatment from the media
really.
Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles:
The government is weak. If this is the way of securing party unity
behind difficult and painful measures, then it had to be done.
Nigel Richardson, an economist with Yamaichi International in London:
It's extraordinary that the economy is picking up and inflation is at
its lowest level since the 1960s and yet the chancellor is being forced
to resign.
Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of public service union Nalgo:
Norman Lamont has been a disaster for Britain and his departure from the
Treasury is at least a year too late.  But it's no use Major shuffling
the cards. We need a new pack.
Lamont Holdings (no relation) annual report:
. . . this long period of depression appears to have bottomed out.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Tory right warns Clarke over EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTWING Conservatives indicated yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new
chancellor, will have to tread carefully if his enthusiasm for Europe is not
to create fresh divisions in Tory ranks.
As Tory MPs reacted to a cabinet reshuffle intended largely to unite the
party after a bruising year since the general election, there were scarcely
coded warnings that Mr Clarke should not push for early British re-entry
into the European exchange rate mechanism.
One Tory Euro-sceptic said Mr Clarke's appointment was 'like a red rag to a
bull'.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, said: 'I think
his major handicap is the fear that his European enthusiasm may overcome
sound economic judgment.'
Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley and a leading opponent of the Maastricht
treaty, said Mr Clarke was, 'a realist' and knew that there was a
substantial group of backbench MPs fiercely opposed to British ERM re-entry.
There was doubt among Euro-sceptics about Mr Clarke's promise that any ERM
move was unlikely before the next election.
On the pro-European wing there was a recognition that Mr Clarke would have
to work within limits set by his backbenchers.
Mr Ian Taylor, Conservative MP for Esher, who heads the Positive European
group of MPs, said: 'I don't think it is a question of him being more
pro-European. I think that he is going to have to deal with things as he
finds them.'
Privately some backbench MPs believed Mr Norman Lamont could cause
substantial damage to the government from the back benches. One Conservative
said his sacking had been 'tactically inept'.
In public the former chancellor won sympathy from colleagues. Some said he
had been a 'scapegoat' and a victim of a 'lust for blood' by a few Tory
backbenchers.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary who had been tipped as a possible
chancellor, said Mr Lamont, 'had pretty unfair treatment from the media'.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers,
said he could understand those who felt Mr Lamont had reason to feel
'aggrieved', having got interest rates and inflation moving in the right
direction.
But the careful balancing of factions by Mr John Major left most Tory MPs
able to find some reason for cheer last night.
There was relief that the prime minister had ended the damaging uncertainty
surrounding the chancellorship and other cabinet posts.
One MP admitted: 'We had got to the state where we couldn't continue with
what we had.'
The decision to keep Mr Michael Portillo, a staunch Thatcherite, as chief
secretary to the Treasury encouraged Tory MPs that there would be no let-up
in the government's determination to curb public spending.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee,
said: 'We will be looking to Kenneth Clarke to give Michael Portillo his 100
per cent support.'
Opposition leader Mr John Smith scoffed at the cabinet changes and likened
Mr Major to the 'captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as
they head for the rocks'.
Calling for a fundamental change of political direction, Mr Smith said the
prime minister was as heavily identified with 'the current economic mess' as
Mr Lamont. He urged Mr Major to accept responsibility for past mistakes.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the prime minister
had dressed up the sacking of the chancellor as a reshuffle.
The cabinet changes were 'just a new coat of paint for a discredited
government'.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Dream job that became a rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Norman Lamont became chancellor of the exchequer in November 1990 he
got the job that he had always wanted.
Yet few post-war British politicians have had such a rough ride in one of
the great offices of state. He would be less than human not to feel more
than a little embittered.
In recent interviews Mr Lamont has made much of the fact that finance
ministers cannot expect to be popular. It is also clear that many of his
off-the-cuff remarks have been reported out of context.
But unpopularity is something a politician carries off more easily when he
or she is equipped with a suitable aura of gravitas. This eluded him.
Instead his chancellorship was punctuated by stories that were sometimes
bizarre, sometimes comical but invariably damaging.
He forgot to pay his hotel bill after one Tory party conference. He exceeded
the spending limit on his credit card bill and the news was leaked to the
press. His Notting Hill home was rented to a sex therapist after the Lamont
family moved to Number 11. The chancellor's response - to hire London's most
expensive libel lawyers to handle the press fall-out - was to have serious
political repercussions when it emerged that part of the bill was paid by
the Treasury.
Mr Lamont's chancellorship was never going to be easy. He took over
stewardship of the economy just as it was moving quickly into recession.
Unemployment, at 1.75m, was starting a rapid rise that was to lift the
jobless level to about 3m at the start of this year and bring the grim
experiences of the loss of job and home to many thousands of Tory voters in
the south of England who had not experienced the direct impact of earlier
recessions.
At the same time the UK's public finances were starting the slide that has
left the government with a borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn a week.
Worse, Mr Lamont's scope for policy action was severely limited by Britain's
entry into the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 at the
ambitious central rate of DM2.95 to the pound.
As Britain was sliding into recession Germany was struggling to control the
inflationary boom triggered by unification. The UK became saddled with tough
monetary conditions that were set by the Bundesbank to deal with Germany's
problems.
The chancellor's difficulties were compounded by his knack of saying the
wrong thing at the wrong time. Hence, unemployment was 'a price worth
paying'. He was 'singing in the bath' after Black Wednesday of September 16
last year, when sterling was ignominiously forced out of the ERM. And a
light-hearted answer - 'Je ne regrette rien' - to a question during the
recent Newbury by-election campaign left the impression that the government
was uncaring and the chancellor unfeeling.
A Eurosceptic by nature, Mr Lamont mishandled relations with some of
Britain's EC partners and in particular with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
German Bundesbank president. The chancellor's attempt to force the
Bundesbank to cut its interest rates early last September was an important
element in the worsening of relations between the two countries ahead of
Black Wednesday.
Yet his chancellorship was not without its achievements. Freed of the ERM
constraints, he presided over a sharp fall in bank base rates from 10 per
cent in September to 6 per cent and a substantial devaluation of sterling
that so far has not been accompanied by any surge in inflation.
Only last week it was announced that inflation as measured by the retail
prices index had fallen to 1.3 per cent in April, its lowest level for
nearly 30 years. The economy, stimulated by the sharp degree of monetary
easing, has returned to growth. Although Mr Lamont can claim little credit
for recovery, the UK is likely to be the fastest growing member of the EC
this year.
In the realm of fiscal policy Mr Lamont has been an innovator. It is
doubtful, however, that he will go down as a significant tax reformer.
Each of his three Budgets contained surprises. The first drew the sting out
of the community charge by ingeniously cutting poll tax payments by Pounds
140 a person, albeit at the cost of adding 2.5 percentage points to VAT. The
second stole the Labour party's thunder in the approach to the 1992 general
election by introducing a new 20 per cent tax band. The third started the
difficult task of redressing the UK's huge public sector deficit by
announcing a Pounds 17bn programme of tax increases over two years.
Mr Lamont leaves the Treasury with much unfinished business. The finance
bill, which contains the measures announced in his March Budget, has just
started passing through the committee stage of the Commons.
Preparations are under way for the first unified Budget that in November
will bring together plans for revenue raising and public spending.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor, will benefit from a far better economic
inheritance than that bequeathed to Mr Lamont, but the risks to recovery are
considerable, with recession in continental Europe threatening to act as a
drag on UK growth. The budget deficit, running at pounds 50bn a year, is
overshadowing economic policy.
That part of the legacy will almost certain present Mr Clarke with his
toughest task.

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Opinion divided over former
chancellor's City job prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT seem that the obvious future for an ex-chancellor, particularly one
with a merchant banking background, would be back in the City. But opinion
was divided yesterday among top headhunters about Mr Norman Lamont's
immediate job prospects.
Mr Lamont's performance at Rothschilds in the 1970s was not generally
considered to have been outstanding and some headhunters are pointing to his
more recently apparent shortcomings in handling pressure.
More importantly, consultants including Mr Nigel Humphreys, managing
director of Tyzack Accord, referred delicately to Mr Lamont's current
'credibility problem' on economic matters.
Mr Humphreys believes the former chancellor should move out of the limelight
and stay away from 'the greenhouse of business', rather than follow in the
footsteps of some of his predecessors.
Lord Barber, for example, when his time as chancellor ended in 1974, became
chairman of Standard Chartered Bank. Lord Lawson, who resigned as chancellor
in 1989, became a director of Barclays Bank and the troubled GPA group. Sir
John Nott, a Treasury minister in the 1970s, became chairman and chief
executive of Lazard Brothers.
Mr Lamont's long-term interests might be best served by going for a top job
in the World Bank or the World Health Organisation, Mr Humphreys said.
Playing an ambassadorial role for a while would be 'a great credibility
builder,' he said. Alternatively, a job away from home, possibly with a
multinational headquartered in continental Europe, could be a possibility.
Such an organisation might consider it a coup 'to hook a foreign chancellor
of the exchequer,' he added.
Mr Paul Buchanan-Barrow, partner with headhunters Korn/Ferry, took the
opposite view of Mr Lamont's prospects. 'I can think of a number of chairmen
who would be self-confident enough to take him on,' he said. That would
include chairmen of banks as well as large corporations. A separate source
named Hambros as a possibility.
Mr Stephen Bampfylde, managing director of headhunters Saxton Bampfylde,
said he 'looked forward to sitting down with Mr Lamont to discuss the
matter'. The former chancellor's range of experience would make him an
'attractive individual for many clients'. Mr Bampfylde said it was no longer
a 'business of selling contacts - that's regarded as vulgar. It's more being
able to say 'this is how Brussels would react', or 'this is how the World
Bank would see things'.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Grimsby evening paper scuppers
chancellor's efforts to keep mum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD exclusive on Norman Lamont's resignation went not to the BBC or
ITN or any of the heavyweight political editors but to Ms Clare Henderson, a
reporter on the Grimsby Evening Telegraph.
Ms Henderson had just finished interviewing a local college headmaster when
she heard about the Cabinet reshuffle. The 26-year-old went immediately to
the Grimsby retirement home of a lady she had written several articles about
 -Norman's mum, 82-year-old Mrs Irene Lamont.
On the steps of Downing Street Mr Lamont was saying nothing. But in Grimsby
Mrs Lamont was happy to tell how her son had just called to say he had
resigned and decided to go to the back benches.
The story broke just as the first edition of the Evening Telegraph was about
to go to press with a strong front page story on the opening of a new theme
park at Cleethorpes.
By 11.55am the first edition was out with a new front page devoted to Mr
Norman Lamont. Cleethorpes was relegated to an inside page.
Mr Peter Moore, editor, said: 'The first edition was an Evening Telegraph
exclusive. The second edition was a world exclusive.' The paper is part of
Northcliffe Newspapers.
The story was sent immediately to the press agency UK News and from there to
Reuters, the international news agency, and around the world.
'It's a victory for local journalism, for doing your homework, for doing the
basics every day,' added Mr Moore proudly.
After her scoop Ms Henderson returned to help Mrs Lamont field the large
number of calls from other news organisations.
But Mrs Lamont was making it clear she was only interested in talking to the
Grimsby Evening Telegraph.

Mr Norman Lamont, ex chancellor:
I have always been willing to be judged on my record. I believe that the
success of the policies I have put into place will become increasingly
clear with the passage of time.
Mrs Irene Lamont (mother):
For the past three years they have given Norman a very rough ride.
Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive ofthe Postel investment group and
a former adviser to Mr Lamont:
To blame him just for being lugubrious on television is a bit harsh.
John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities:
The markets have not been reacting nearly as much as the media. He was
his own worst enemy but to a very large extent he was a victim of
history.
Lamont Holdings (no relation) annual report:
. . .  this long period of depression appears to have bottomed out.
Already a marked improvement in activity levels is evident.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Generator holds back on coal deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS FOR the 12 coal mines reprieved by the government last March
deteriorated yesterday when National Power, the largest electricity
generator, ruled out signing contracts with them before the autumn.
Separately, British Coal announced plans to offer four deep mines to the
private sector. Advertisements offering them for licence appear in the
Financial Times and other newspapers today. Another 16 pits will be offered
in the next few weeks.
The long-term threat to coal's future was underlined yesterday when the
government gave National Power consent to build a 1,500MW combined-cycle
turbine power station - running on gas and steam - in Staythorpe,
Nottinghamshire. The company said it had still to decide on whether to
commission that station or another at Didcot, Oxfordshire, but would not do
so until the summer of 1997.
National Power's decision to wait until autumn to sign new contracts with
British Coal means that the 1m tonnes a month produced by the 12 reprieved
pits is destined, at least temporarily, for British Coal's stockpiles.
PowerGen, the corporations's other main customer, is thought to be adopting
an even tougher stance.
Coal industry analysts say the longer the generators delay the contracts for
additional coal - which are essential for the survival of the 12 pits - the
harder the bargain they will drive on prices and volume.
British Coal has offered to supply at between 90p and 95p per gigajoule,
less than two-thirds of the price in existing contracts.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, speaking yesterday at his
company's annual financial results presentation, said British Coal's offer
was designed to be 'in the competitive ball park'.
The company did not want to test the market until the autumn, however,
partly to comply with fair trading constraints - a reference to the need to
conclude deals with private-sector mines that will emerge from British
Coal's licensing exercise.
The pits being offered immediately to the private sector by British Coal are
Easington, in Durham; Bolsover, in Derbyshire; and Cotgrave and Silverhill
in Nottinghamshire.
Mr Neil Clarke, corporation chairman, said some pits could be reopened under
new management in the autumn. All pits would be subject to competitive
tender, to be evaluated by independent consultants.
Tender selection will be based on 18 sets of criteria, including financial
returns to British Coal, proposals for restoring a site after production
ends, and 'tenderer's commitment to long-term development of a mine'.
Applicants will be able to visit a mine after payment of a Pounds 10,000
bond and to bid after paying a further Pounds 50,000 bond. Both sums will be
returnable.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining, which is due to be floated
on the stock exchange next month, said his company would consider each
licensing opportunity on its merits. 'There is considerable market potential
out there,' he said.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Boots blamed for high-cost lens solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CLEAR VISION has a price
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and it is far too high, according to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
which yesterday found that consumers have been over-charged for contact lens
solutions.
More than 2m people in Britain wear contact lenses and have to spend between
Pounds 110 and Pounds 205 a year each on products to clean and disinfect
them. The monopolies commission's report said the market, worth Pounds 91m
at retail prices, provided some of the fattest profits in pharmaceuticals
manufacturing and retailing.
The commission found the market had been restricted by government
regulations which required solution manufacturers to obtain a licence, and
limited retail sales to chemists and pharmacies. The rules had slowed
product innovation and impeded price competition.
A complex monopoly had developed among retailers generally. But the
commission blamed high prices mainly on Allergan, the leading manufacturer,
and Boots, the biggest retailer of solutions, which had exploited scale
monopolies.
The commission had no evidence that UK prices were above those elsewhere in
Europe but it said that the practices of the two companies practices had
kept prices higher than they would otherwise have been. Allergan, which
supplied 38 per cent of solutions in the UK, had earned an average return on
capital of 102 per cent in the past five years - twice the average in the UK
industry.
The MMC said Allergan and other manufacturers had benefited from weak retail
competition, which had reduced pressure on suppliers to cut prices. The
commission found that no other manufacturers were illegally exploiting
monopoly power, however.
The report's most scathing criticism was of Boots, the UK's largest chain of
chemists. Boots had 36 per cent of all solution sales last year, earning
gross profit margins between 50 per cent and 61 per cent - well above the
average on its overall retail sales. Although Boots used its purchasing
power to buy cheaply from manufacturers, it failed to pass on the benefits.
It sold branded solutions at recommended retail prices and had only small
reductions on own-label products.
Boots had also tried in 1990 to prevent price cutting by optician Dollond &amp;
Aitchison. CV-UK, the second largest supplier, told the MMC that Boots had
informed it that unless Dollond raised prices, Boots would cut its own and
expected CV-UK to pay for any erosion in its margins.
The commission recommended that the sale of solutions be opened to all
retailers. It also urged the government to implement quickly a European
Community directive intended to allow the freer cross-border supply of the

The commission suggested that if the government rejected its proposals a

UK OIL production fell last month to 1.75m barrels a day, its lowest level
since last June, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland. The value of
Britain's oil output fell 7 per cent, largely due to lower oil prices and
the fall in the value of the dollar against sterling.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Property leasing changes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment yesterday published a consultation paper
on commercial property leases, which could lead to far-reaching changes in
the UK property industry, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The government is seeking responses to a number of possible changes,
including the prohibition of upward-only rent review clauses, the
prohibition of confidentiality clauses and establishment of a body to
arbitrate disputed rent reviews.
Responses to the proposals are sought by September 30.
The decision to issue a consultation paper follows widespread criticism of
commercial leases by tenants. They say that practices such as upward-only
reviews and confidentiality clauses have favoured landlords over tenants and
increased recessionary pressures on their businesses.
Significant government intervention in commercial leases would be opposed by
landlords, however. They believe it could cut property values and deter
development.
The government has said it does not intend legislating in any way to alter
the terms in existing contracts.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Time fails to heal BCCI wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PASSING of nearly two years since the closure of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International had not diminished the anger of the collapsed bank's
creditors who attended a meeting at Wembley Arena in London yesterday.
Several hundred creditors - predominantly from the Asian community -
gathered to express their frustration with the liquidators from accountancy
firm Touche Ross and to ask for details of how soon and how much they might
be paid.
As the afternoon wore on, frustrated members of the audience began to shout
objections to the four liquidators and a lawyer, who were seated behind a
large desk on a stage reminiscent of a scene from the Supreme Soviet.
An English court had ruled that yesterday's meeting was necessary to elect a
formal creditors' committee, but the liquidators decided also to give a
presentation and answer questions.
Just a few minutes into the 3 1/2 -hour meeting, they agreed under pressure
from Mr Keith Vaz MP, head of the parliamentary BCCI group, to change the
order of the agenda in order to allow questions and comments before the
vote.
Mr Christopher Morris, the liquidator who did all the talking and chaired
the meeting, expressed slight surprise that there were just 524 creditors or
their representatives present - compared with 105 journalists.
Several creditors were angry about Touche Ross's fees, which come to more
than Dollars 133m (Pounds 86.3m) worldwide.
'Why don't you just go home and give us the rest of the money?' one
demanded.
A number called for litigation against the government of Abu Dhabi, the
bank's majority shareholder, instead of the proposed contribution of Dollars
1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn negotiated between Abu Dhabi and the team of
liquidators.
Mr Morris said the agreement was the best chance for creditors to receive
money, and said that a court appeal in Luxembourg to reject the agreement
was 'regrettable' and merely delayed payment.
He said if the agreement was approved, creditors could expect to receive 15p
in the pound by next year and, 'conservatively', 30p to 40p eventually.
There was some confusion over the ballot to elect the creditors' committee.
Mr Hal Skolnik, one of three creditors who has appealed to the Luxembourg
court and one of the 24 standing for the committee, told the audience not to
vote for him for fear of splitting the vote of other candidates also opposed
to the Abu Dhabi deal.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Heseltine undermines travel industry rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW REGULATIONS for the package travel industry were in disarray yesterday
after it emerged that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, had told an Oxford-based holiday company it did not have to
protect customers' money because it allowed them to specify what ferry
service they wished to use.
The company, SFV Holidays which went into liquidation last Friday, had taken
800 bookings for French self-catering accommodation this summer. The company
is unbonded.
Mr John Cullom, managing director, said yesterday he hoped to announce early
next week that the company had been sold and that customers' holidays were
safe.
He said SVF had believed that, under a European Community directive, it was
obliged to ensure that travellers' deposits and payments could be returned.
He said Mr Heseltine's view - set out in two letters to Mr John Patten, the
education secretary and MP for Oxford - that the company did not have to
comply 'surprised us enormously'.
Mr Stephen Hickman, acting head of the consumer section of the Oxfordshire
Trading Standards department, said trading standards officers had told the
company that if it sold ferry crossings as well as holidays it had to comply
with the regulations.
Mr Cullom said 95 per cent of its customers bought travel and accommodation.
The EC directive applies if a company provides a pre-arranged combination of
accommodation and transport at an inclusive price. Companies can arrange a
bond through an organisation such as the Association of British Travel
Agents or the Association of Independent Tour Operators, take out an
insurance policy, or hold customer deposits in separate accounts.
SFV's application to join Aito was rejected last October. Aito said
yesterday the company 'did not have the right profile'. It is believed Aito
had come across several complaints about SFV.
SFV wrote to Mr Patten in January and March last year saying it was having
difficulty complying with the regulations as it had been refused Aito
membership and could not get quotations from insurance companies.
In letters dated January 18 and May 5 Mr Heseltine said the company did not
need to comply with the regulations. 'This is because the customer is
required himself to specify what ferry service he wishes to use, without
advice or assistance from the company selling the holiday.'
Mr Noel Josephides, Aito chairman, said if Mr Heseltine's argument were
accepted, 'most of our members wouldn't require bonding'. He said virtually
every company selling French holidays allowed customers to choose the ferry
crossing they wanted.
Abta said Mr Heseltine's advice would create a 'huge problem' for consumers.
'The DTI has been telling consumers that they're protected, but there's
nobody there to enforce that. We've said all along that it's only a matter
of time before a tour operator collapses and people lose their holidays,' it
said.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Tireless fighter for miners: Obituary: Lord Gormley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOE GORMLEY, president of the National Union of Mineworkers from 1971 to
1982, died yesterday aged 75 after a long illness.
During his stormy years as leader, Lord Gormley led the miners through two
national coal strikes in the early 1970s, taking them back to the top of the
manual wage earnings table after a long period of decline. But he always
rejected the views of his union's vocal left-wing.
He was prepared to fight for his members' interests but had no wish to
confront governments.
A hard-headed pragmatist, Gormley practised the art of negotiating. His
canny bargaining skills were coupled with a sureness of touch in reading the
often uncertain mood of the coalfields.
But Gormley could not always deliver his promises, as Conservative prime
minister Edward Heath learned to his cost in 1973, when he sought a deal to
prevent a miners' strike. Gormley was unable to sell the deal to his
executive, contributing to Heath's downfall in the February 1974 general
election, fought partly on the issue of union power.
Under Gormley the NUM became one of Britain's most powerful unions.
In alliance with Coal Board chairman Sir Derek Ezra he lobbied successfully
for massive investment and subsidies after the quadrupling of oil prices in
1973 seemed to restore coal's lost power as a strategic fuel.
In his later presidential years Gormley found it difficult to contain his
union's resurgent left.
Born in Lancashire, Gormley left school at 14 and spent his next 28 years
down the pit. He was elected to the NUM executive in 1957, and became
north-west area secretary four years later. In 1971 he defeated the Scottish
miners leader Mick McGahey to become NUM president.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Scott big match lacks punch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HELLIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS SUPPOSED to be the day Lord Justice Scott's investigation into the
arms to Iraq affair burst into life.
A hastily convened session, the first appearance of a cabinet minister, and
the charge that he, while attorney-general, had tried to dissuade Sir Hal
Miller, the former conservative MP, from producing evidence in court for
fear it would have embarrassed the government.
In the event, those who had reserved seats for the spectacle - some arrived
a full hour before the start of proceedings - were treated to a complex
verbal exchange that always looked like falling well short of delivering a
knock-out blow.
It was difficult not to be aware that the real drama of the day was taking
place not far away in another part of Westminster.
The government witness, Sir Patrick Mayhew, is well known as a safe pair of
hands. And so he proved.
He arrived several minutes early and, flanked by three minders, outsmarted
the television crews by heading for the front door of the Buckingham Gate
building instead of the side entrance.
Taking a seat, and after having been addressed by Lord Justice Scott, Sir
Patrick read from a seven-page statement his staff had prepared over the
last two days in between dealing with the Anglo-Irish negotiations.
He did not wish to challenge Sir Hal's good faith, of course, but on the
central issue of whether he put pressure on him not to produce documents in
court he disagreed with him.
Perhaps there had been some misunderstanding, for the crucial conversation
had taken place in a crowded and noisy lobby - the Conservative majority in
the last parliament being rather large, Sir Patrick noted.
Lord Justice Scott and counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale started their
questioning fairly aggressively but as the session wore on the three lawyers
lost most of their audience as the focus of attention moved away from Sir
Hal's allegations, so forcibly denied in the early moments, to the powers of
the attorney-general and other matters of law.
Much of the debate centred on degrees of emphasis. Was the chairman of
Customs 'pushing very hard' for prosecutions in the supergun case to go
ahead, as Miss Baxendale believed he was, or was he simply 'probing a
point', as Sir Patrick maintained, during meetings between the two men in
November 1990?
As the Scott inquiry takes a two-week break, the government appears to have
survived its stiffest test so far. But this affair has a habit of springing
surprises. It is far from over yet.

FT  28 MAY 93 / HGV test sites to be sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day announced plans to privatise the annual testing of
heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches by selling the 91 testing stations
of the Vehicle Inspectorate.
A flurry of announcements on Civil Service reform issued as parliament rose
for the Whitsun recess included the sale of two transport agencies, a new
agency to run the law courts and a review into further commercialising Her
Majesty's Stationery Office, one of the most profitable agencies.
But there was an unexpected reprieve for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency in Swansea, where 3,000 staff process information on 24m vehicles and
35m drivers. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said that he had
rejected its privatisation for the next three years.
The sale of Vehicle Inspectorate testing stations will affect the jobs of
about 900 civil servants.
The stations will be sold where they are profitable, initially with sole
testing rights for their area. After a transitional period other companies
will be allowed to compete for the business.
Unprofitable stations will be contracted out to the private sector. The
government plans to specify the maximum fee which can be charged, and hopes
that profitable testing stations will compete by charging less than the
maximum.
Mr MacGregor also announced plans to sell the Transport Research Laboratory
and DVOIT, the transport department's information technology arm.
The research laboratory, based at Crowthorne, Berkshire, employs more than
600 staff on research into road safety, highway construction and traffic
management.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, told the House of Lords yesterday the
agency to run the court service would be created in April 1995. It would be
headed by a chief executive who would be responsible for the management and
administration of all the courts in England and Wales except magistrates'
and coroners' courts. Magistrates' courts are managed locally.
The review of Her Majesty's Stationery Office will consider whether it
should be allowed to compete for business in the private sector. HMSO is at
present restricted to selling its services to the public sector.
The government moved to cut red tape for road transport operators yesterday
by proposing that goods vehicle operators' licences should be required only
for vehicles weighing 6 tonnes or more and should no longer need to be
renewed at five-year intervals.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Jobs end for 420 at Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 420 Swan Hunter employees, many of whom spent their entire working
lives at the Tyneside shipbuilder, were made compulsorily redundant
yesterday and left the yard without any immediate pay-off.
Because the company is in receivership, they must apply to the Department of
Employment for their pay-offs under the state redundancy fund, which pays a
maximum Pounds 6,150. The department confirmed that payment is 'normally'
made within 13 weeks.
In addition they will receive up to 13 weeks' wages in lieu of notice, also
delayed.
Tyneside Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers (Wallsend) and Mr Nick Brown (Newcastle
East) met the prime minister at Downing Street yesterday and stressed the
need for Swans to be allowed to complete the three frigates it is
outfitting.
Afterwards Mr Byers said that the prime minister had listened carefully. 'I
got the impression there's a recognition shipbuilding is crucial to the
manufacturing and industrial base of the north-east,' he said.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Insurers warn on Pool Re 'panic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS COULD be on a collision course with the government over moves to
increase premium rates for terrorism insurance after last month's
Bishopsgate bomb.
The Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade association,
yesterday said the government was stepping up pressure on Pool Re, the new
government-backed reinsurer, to increase rates.
Describing any rise as 'premature' and warning against 'panic reaction', the
association said a rates review should be left until later this year.
The association believes higher rates will be offset by a diminishing
take-up by businesses of terrorist cover, undermining the effectiveness of
Pool Re. The Department of Trade and Industry said negotiations with
industry were continuing. No final decisions about increases had been taken
but a detailed review of rating was under way. 'The original rates were set
at great speed,' it said.
A report by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consulting actuaries, submitted to Pool Re
this week, could form the basis for the change in rating. The report is
understood to recommend steep increases in rates for businesses based in
London. Some companies could face rate rises of 300 per cent. Those in safer
areas could benefit from reductions.
Pool Re was set up earlier this year when insurers withdrew terrorist
coverage from standard commercial policies after last year's mainland
bombing campaign by the IRA.

<TEXT>
PARENT-TEACHER asso-ciations are overwhelmingly opposed to this year's
national curriculum tests in England and Wales, says a ballot announced
today, John Authers writes.
The poll, by the Electoral Reform Society for the National Confederation of
Parent Teacher Associations, found 76.2 per cent of primary school parents
opposed tests for seven-year-olds, and 78.4 per cent of secondary school
parents were against tests for 14-year-olds.
The results contradict a telephone poll of 1,000 parents for the Department
for Education, showing 37 per cent opposition.
Ms Margaret Morrissey, of the NCPTA, called again for the tests to be made
voluntary, adding parents were entitled to remove their children from tests.
Ballot forms were sent to the NCPTA's 9,504 members on May 14, after the
statement by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that they would be
simplified for next year.

lira, in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, but has not yet made a decision,
a senior Turkish official said yesterday.
'The Turkish government is examining the possibility of allowing large-scale
use of the lira in north Iraq, but has made no decision on the matter,' Mr
Volkan Vural, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Mr Vural told reporters at a news conference in Istanbul that the Kurds in
northern Iraq were already using the lira along with other convertible
western currencies.
Some Kurdish groups in north Iraq have proposed that Turkey allow wide use
of the lira in the Kurdish-controlled region after Iraq withdrew the
premium-priced 25-dinar notes from circulation earlier this month.
The withdrawal has blasted a hole in the economy of the north, already all
but dependent on western aid ferried in from neighbouring Turkey.
If the speculators in Jordan and Iraq's other Arab neighbours were Baghdad's
main target, the decision to withdraw the note from May 6 has also seriously
hurt the Kurdish region, where the note was the main instrument for savings
and for trade with Turkey and Iran.
Mr Mohamed Zejjari, the United Nations special co-ordinator for Iraq, who
was in Ankara yesterday, reportedly told western officials the Iraqi move
was 'understandable' and played down the impact on the Kurds. However, a
fact-finding mission by Turkish and western diplomats this week concluded
that as much as a third of the wealth of the self-declared Kurdish region
had evaporated.
The old 25-dinar note, manufactured in Switzerland before the Gulf war, has
been replaced with a new inferior-quality note, which because of UN
sanctions had to be printed on President Saddam Hussein's own presses.
Baghdad finessed the speculators and the Kurds by sealing the country's
borders, thus preventing those outside from being able to benefit from the
week-long currency amnesty when old notes could still be exchanged.
On June 1, government donors meet in Geneva, in the wake of a new appeal by
the UN for Dollars 500m for Iraq.
Diplomats say humanitarian needs in the north have sharply increased, as the
note's withdrawal has devastated Kurdish savings, and caused a 50 per cent
rise in prices and a 50 per cent depreciation of the dinar against the
dollar.
Kurds estimate that a third of the entire currency in circulation in the
north was in 25-dinar notes. In a surprisingly orderly exercise, holders of
the 25-dinar note were told to register with local banks. About 1.3bn Iraqi
dinars in 25-dinar notes was registered, each holder issued with a
certificate, locally known as a 'death certificate'.
Money traders in Erbil and other cities refused to handle the note this
week.
It was, as one diplomat put it, 'tragic to see the market mechanism at
work.'
For western governments, the move marks a further tightening of Iraq's
economic embargo on the Kurdish region.
No western power, Turkey least of all, wants to see an independent Kurdish
state in north Iraq for fear of Iranian exploitation.
But the allies are keen to support the region, not least to avoid another
exodus of refugees, the main reason for the continued allied air presence in
south-west Turkey, the so-called operation Provide Comfort.
There is concern now that Baghdad may take similar action to withdraw the
5-dinar and 10-dinar notes, the principal denominations for transactions in
the local market.

PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos has ordered energy officials to study the possibility
of building new nuclear plants to help solve a power crisis, Reuter reports
from Manila.
The Philippines has mothballed its first nuclear plant, built by
Westinghouse Electric in 1985, calling it unsafe. The US company has denied
the charge, and a Philippine claim for compensation is pending before an
international arbitration panel in Geneva.
Mr Ramos last night directed Mr Delfin Lazaro, the energy secretary, to
study the feasibility of putting up new nuclear plants, a presidential
palace statement said.
Mr Ramos said he did not oppose setting up nuclear power plants as long as
they were in places where they posed no danger to people, but the 600 MW
Bataan plant built by Westinghouse would probably be operated as a coal- or
oil-fired power project.
Manila and the rest of Luzon island suffer some eight hours of power cuts
daily because of low generating capacity, worsened by the frequent breakdown
of ageing power plants.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Beijing to resume HK airport talks
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday agreed to resume high-level talks with Britain about Hong
Kong's airport project, ending an eight-month hiatus in negotiations for the
financing of one of Asia's most ambitious infrastructure developments.
The Hong Kong government said yesterday that the Airport Committee of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group would meet on Friday next week - the fourth
anniversary of the suppression of the Beijing democracy movement on June 4,
1989. The committee last met in October.
The prospect of the meeting buoyed the Hong Kong stock market, which rose
nearly 100 points to close at a record of 7,447.24. The colony's financial
markets interpreted earlier reports that a meeting would take place as
heralding a possible solution to the impasse over financing the HKDollars
165bn (Pounds 13.9bn) project.
Hong Kong government officials cautioned that it was unlikely the airport
issue would be settled at the first meeting. But it comes at a critical time
as funding for the Provisional Airport Authority's administrative expenses
expires at the end of June. The Legislative Council, the colony's law making
body, is due to reconsider voting the PAA more money shortly and many
members will take their lead from China.
In recent weeks, China has moved to improve the atmosphere surrounding
Anglo-Chinese discussions about Hong Kong's economic development. Hitherto,
Beijing had linked Hong Kong economic issues to Governor Chris Patten
withdrawing his proposals for democratic development in Hong Kong.
There have, however, been indications that China was prepared to resume
talks about the airport. In what was seen as another positive development,
last week Beijing approved three non-airport-related business franchises
which span the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China.
The apparent willingness of Beijing to consider the financing of the airport
and its connecting railway prompted the Hong Kong government, about a month
ago, to put forward a portfolio of alternative financing proposals. They
have been designed to allay China's concerns about the large amounts of debt
that might have to be raised to pay for the project.
British officials connected to the discussions said they had been encouraged
by the Chinese insistence that the details of the most recent proposals be
kept confidential. On two previous occasions last year when the Hong Kong
government presented funding options to Beijing it insisted on publication
and criticised the plans.
'(Asking for confidentiality) is something they would do if they were
serious about reaching an agreement, although it does not necessarily mean
that they are,' one observed.
Businessmen who are advisers to Beijing have said over recent days that
China wants the airport issue settled although it still has concerns about
the cost of the airport railway. The Hong Kong government believes that to
build the airport without its connecting railway would not make economic
sense.

PAKISTAN'S newly reinstated prime minister Nawaz Sharif won a sweeping
victory in a crucial vote of confidence yesterday after Ms Benazir Bhutto,
the opposition leader boycotted the emergency session of parliament.
Diplomats said the triumph removed lingering doubts about Mr Sharif's
parliamentary strength a day after an historic supreme court decision
overturned his dismissal by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan last month on
charges of nepotism and terrorising his opponents.
In all 123 members of the 217-seat lower house of parliament, the national
assembly, voted in his favour.
The prime minister repeated his call to the opposition to join forces to
curtail powers that President Ishaq Khan used to sack both Mr Sharif and Ms
Bhutto.
Ms Bhutto, and dissident politicians who left Mr Sharif's camp last month,
met to discuss ways of forming a new anti-government alliance.
Mr Sharif extended an olive branch to his opponents, saying he was prepared
for discussions with anyone to seek new constitutional reforms.
His opponents are unlikely to be able to challenge his authority in
parliament, but the government could face heated debates and fierce
criticisms, senior officials said.
The extent to which that could intensify political pressure on Mr Sharif
remains unclear but many political observers remain convinced that Mr
Sharif's most difficult political challenge could yet come in the form of
new conflicts with Pakistan's four provincial governments.
The provinces are widely known for their loyalty to Mr Khan.
Elsewhere there were signs that business confidence was returning. The
Karachi stock exchange, Pakistan's largest stock market, rise by 29 points
ysterday, its largest rise on a single day this year.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Japanese MPs find the status quo has a certain appeal:
Preview of party talks on electoral reform provoked by earlier scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a year of scandal-prompted promises to reform Japanese politics and
haggling between government and opposition parties over the shape of that
reform, the head of a parliamentary reform committee has sagely concluded
that 'the best compromise is to keep the current system'.
The fate of reform will be partly determined today at a 'summit' of Japan's
opposition parties, very willing to discuss radical changes to the country's
tainted electoral system, but unwilling to accept a new system reducing
their influence and, in particular, threatening present MPs with
unemployment.
Reaching a political consensus is a refined form of theatre in Japan.
Principles are paraded on stage and the lines are delivered with such
conviction that the casual spectator gets the impression that Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party are genuinely intending to dismantle the system that
sustains them.
The urgency surrounding the political reform debate, and the theatre of
politics, was of Italianate proportions three months ago. The 'don' of
Japanese politics, Mr Shin Kanemaru, was indicted for tax evasion, and
prosecutors found a list drafted by construction companies rating
politicians from A+ to D, according to their clout - the sort of list that
causes more embarrassment if your name is left off.
As with so many scandals, the prosecutors' office controlled the flow of
controversy-stirring evidence, leaked strategically to the Japanese media,
whose reports angered the public and forced Mr Miyazawa to devote his term
in office to 'the cause of political reform'.
In highlighting the cosy links between construction companies, politicians
and public works contracts, the prosecutors confirmed what most Japanese
suspected. The evidence suggests that a small percentage of many public
works contracts is essentially regarded as a LDP donation by the
bid-winning, and sometimes bid-rigging, construction company.
The prosecutors had tapped a rich vein of scandals by raiding the offices of
construction companies. Mr Kanemaru was not the only Japanese politician to
have accepted funds from the construction industry, whose level of
entertainment expenses, about Y8 (4 pence) per Y1,000 of sales, is the
highest of all Japanese industries.
Having made the point about bid-rigging and having made an example of Mr
Kanemaru, who suffered the indignity of being refused admission by Tokyo
hospitals for a check-up after his release on Y300m bail, the prosecutors
retreated. Construction executives ceremonially apologised and promised
never to rig bids again, and the reform debate rambled off course.
That does not mean Japanese think the need for reform has passed, but the
flow of prosecutor-leaked headlines has dried up, and Mr Miyazawa is under
no immediate pressure to respond to allegations. An annual survey by the
prime minister's office released last month found that 70.1 per cent of
10,000 respondents thought public opinion was not properly reflected in
national politics.
About 81 per cent of those aged between 30 and 34 said their opinions were
not reflected. Another poll found that 10 per cent of voters support the
Japan New Party, a recently-formed reformist group.
The largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party of Japan recorded
only 9.2 per cent in the same poll, down 3.7 per cent on the previous month,
while other opposition parties, including Komeito (the Clean Government
Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party, had their ratings trimmed.
These parties have a chance today to improve their popularity by reaching
agreement on a new electoral system. The LDP is proposing single-seat
constituencies, which would ensure it a hefty majority, while opposition
parties can't agree on a mix of proportional representation and
single-seats.
Compromise proposals suggested by the LDP have a touch of the absurd. An LDP
reformist group suggests that a blend of proportional representation and
single-seats be concocted to ensure that each party has an unchanged number
of MPs. Another LDP suggestion is that the lower house, which is more
powerful, be single-seat and the upper house be proportional, an idea
rejected by the opposition.
The emphasis on changing the electoral system is a recognition that the
present multi-seat constituencies system encourages scandal by stimulating
the fund raising competition among the LDP's factions. Meanwhile, the Social
Democratic Party is habitually unable to select more than one candidate,
condemning itself to eternal opposition, as sitting members fear that
running two candidates will split the party's already small vote.
Professor Rei Shiratori, dean of political science at Tokai University, is
certain that the government and opposition will not reach a consensus this
year: 'It is totally impossible for change to happen this time around. There
must be a general election before February, and the parties are already
choosing their candidates. They don't really want change.'
The prospect of nothing happening challenges a breakaway LDP faction formed
by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the
former LDP secretary-general and famed fixer, who threatened to form a new
party if Mr Miyazawa does not proceed with reform. It is possible that the
faction, in co-operation with opposition parties, could win a no-confidence
vote in the parliament and force a general election.
But it is also possible that the faction would be badly bruised at the
polls, as Mr Ozawa is popularly seen as close to the fallen Mr Kanemaru and
is having difficulty raising the cash for an election campaign. Even the
LDP's most ardent reformers are reluctant to discard the security of the
system that made them.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Israel sells shares in Bank Hapoalim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli government yesterday sold off 16.5 per cent of its shares in
Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank, raising an immediate Shk360m, our
Jerusalem correspondent writes.
The sale, which was 120 times over subsribed, is expected to yield a total
of Shk783m (Pounds 187m) once various share options are realised over the
coming year.
Yesterday's sale marked the first time that shares in Hapoalim have been
traded on the Israeli stock exchange for almost a decade. Shares in the big
Israeli banks collapsed in October 1983 after years in which they inflated
their own share prices, leaving the Israeli government with little option
but to bail out the sector by taking a controlling interest in the banks.
Until yesterday, the government owned 97 per cent of Hapoalim and the
sell-off represents only the first small step on the government's long road
to divesting itself of all the shares in the major banks it stepped in to
buy 10 years ago.

FT  28 MAY 93 / China on the defensive over Tibet: Beijing's rising
sensitivity to international pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DALAI LAMA, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, this week said he had
been 'deeply distressed' over China's use of force to put down
demonstrations in Lhasa, and also over the 'deteriorating situation' there.
But at another level, the exiled leadership in Dharmsala, northern India,
must be deriving some encouragement from the recent turn of events. On few
occasions since the Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959 after the failure of
an armed rebellion against Chinese rule has the Tibetan issue received such
favourable attention in the west.
Beijing itself is under considerable diplomatic pressure over Tibet and
other human rights issues; and this at a moment when it is particularly
vulnerable to such pressure.
Difficulties China faces persuading the world it is doing its best to
improve the lot of Tibetans were underscored last weekend when a European
Community fact-finding mission ended in recrimination after reports surfaced
alleging that the authorities had detained two Tibetans who had wanted to
make contact.
Chinese denials that the arrest of a Tibetan tour guide and a monk had
anything to do with the presence in the region of the EC mission were not
especially convincing. A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing accused the
two of engaging in separatist activities.
Riots in the streets of Lhasa followed a day after the EC envoys returned to
Beijing which merely served to deepen impressions that all was not well on
the roof of the world. The EC report on its investigations can hardly avoid
some form of censure, thus multiplying bad news on the human rights front
for China. The Tibet issue is unlikely to go away.
In Beijing, a western official who monitors human rights issues, said that
'unless the Tibetans get some real autonomy, there's not going to be peace.
We can't see light at the end of the tunnel.'
Adding to pressures on China are the issues of its trading status with the
US, and also its attempts to secure nomination for Beijing to stage the 2000
Olympiad.
Both these issues have afforded China's critics in the west additional
leverage on human rights, much to Chinese consternation.
US congressmen have used renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status as the pretext for a strong push on Tibetan rights. Congresswoman
Nancy Pelosi, introducing a revised bill last month that would attach
conditionality to MFN renewal, said the bill had 'placed more emphasis on
the political situation in Tibet and the Chinese threat to Tibetan culture.'
Among these provisions is one that demands that China cease 'financial and
other incentives to encourage non-Tibetans to relocate in Tibet.' Other
items call on Beijing to adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and to cease religious persecution in China and Tibet.
The fact that references to Tibet in the latest Pelosi bill have been
stiffened by comparison with the 1992 version attests to the success of the
Tibet lobby to push its case, and to attract influential supporters inside
and outside Congress.
Since his 1989 Nobel peace prize award - the same year as the June 4
massacre of pro-democracy activists in Beijing's Tiananmen square - the
Dalai Lama has also become more visible internationally. National leaders
who might have been reluctant to receive him for fear of angering China, now
appear more than willing to risk the diplomatic fallout.
Thus President Bush met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader last year, and
Mr Clinton, along with Vice-President Al Gore, has done so this year. Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, received the Dalai Lama earlier
this month in London - a meeting that drew protest from Beijing.
Beijing's options regarding Tibet would seem to be rather limited, since
there is no sign that it might be willing to address the autonomy issue.
Indeed, there has been little progress on that front since Mr Deng Xiaoping,
China's paramount leader, observed in the late 1970s that everything was
negotiable on Tibet except independence or separation.
China's most authoritative recent statement on Tibet came in September last
year with its white paper 'Tibet - Its Ownership and Human Rights
Situation,' which unequivocally re-stated historical claims to the region,
but at the same time held out something of an olive branch to the Dalai Lama
in a form of words employed often in the past.
'So long as the Dalai Lama can give up his divisive stand and admit that
Tibet is an inalienable part of China, the central government is willing to
hold talks at any time with him,' the White Paper, issued by China's State
Council, or 'cabinet,' said.
In the meantime, China is seeking to counter waves of negative publicity by
giving added prominence in its official media to 'positive' developments in
Tibet: thus, recent New China News Agency despatches reported that Tibetan
officers are assuming more responsibility in People's Liberation Army ranks,
Tibetan women are becoming more fashion-conscious and more lamas (religious
figures) are taking the capitalist road by going into business.
It is this latter development - the commercialisation of Tibet - that may
lie behind some of the recent unrest, together with the effect of rising
prices in a region whose incomes have traditionally lagged well behind other
more prosperous areas. Indeed, last Monday's disturbances are said to have
begun as a protest against increases in grain prices, and then to have
developed nationalist overtones.
The economic opening of Tibet has also brought with it something of a
'goldrush' of Chinese merchants who have sought to exploit opportunities in
a frontier area where competition may not be as hot as elsewhere in China.
In the process, some ethnic Chinese in Tibet have become conspicuously
wealthy, fuelling resentment of less well-off Tibetans.
What may prove even more of a threat than Han chauvinism to Tibetan culture
and respect for the spiritual leadership of the Dalai Lama in the long run
is modernism in all its forms. Fabled Lhasa, Shangri-La as it has often been
described, now boasts more than 70 Karaoke bars, and prostitution and
drug-taking is said to be rife.
A western human rights activist was recently quoted as saying after a visit
to Lhasa: 'It's the degradation of society - alcohol, bars, prostitutes.
Tibetans call it a Chinese conspiracy, but it's probably not. Full-blown
economic development is the policy.'

FT  28 MAY 93 / Backward step in Latin America: Guatemala is only the latest
state to see anti-democratic action, but some countries are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America's new democracies look embattled. The bright new morning of
1991, when every country in Latin America and the Caribbean was being run by
an elected government, has gone.
The idea that Latin America was at last going to become a democratic
continent espousing free market principles, beloved of former US President
George Bush and adopted by the Clinton administration, has taken a
battering.
This week's suspension of the constitution in Guatemala by President Jorge
Serrano follows closely on the suspension from office of Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez to face corruption charges. Two military coup
attempts last year unsuccessfully tried to unseat Mr Perez. Elsewhere in
Latin America, Brazil's President Fernando Collor resigned to avoid
impeachment for corruption at the end of last year. In April 1992, President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru suspended the constitution.
The developments in Peru and Guatemala have underlined the immense
difficulty of taking international action to reverse anti-democratic
actions. This was most forcefully demonstrated in the case of Haiti, where
the military overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in October
1991.
Economic sanctions imposed by the Organisation of American States have been
largely ineffective and the military has not been persuaded to step down.
According to Mr George Philip, reader in Latin American Politics at the
London School of Economics, the impression of international helplessness may
have been accentuated by the current perceived weakness in US foreign
policy, as exemplified by the anguished policy debate over Bosnia.
The role of the military in the region also gives cause for concern. The era
of dictatorships headed by bemedalled generals may be over, yet in the 1990s
the military in many countries prefers to exercise its power behind the
scenes. 'In Guatemala, you have an elected president suspending congress.
It's very ambiguous; it makes it difficult to produce an international
response,' said Mr Kenneth Maxwell of the Council on Foreign Relations in
New York.
Peru, for instance, regained access to loans from the international
financial institutions after a new congress was elected. Yet the freedom of
action of that congress continues to be severely constrained by the constant
threat of military intervention.
Mr Serrano's move looked almost identical to Mr Fujimori's. He cited
opposition in congress to economic reform, the influence of drugs
traffickers and corruption as the reasons behind his 'self coup'. Like
perhaps a third of Guatemalans, Mr Serrano is an evangelical Protestant, a
group which helped bring Mr Fujimori to power in Peru. Both men preside over
societies deeply divided on racial lines and both countries face leftist
insurgencies.
Yet, according to Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute of Latin
American Studies in London, there is an important difference. While the
Peruvian military could make a reasonable case that its hand needed
strengthening in the battle against the left-wing Sendero Luminoso
guerrillas, the Guatemalan military remained almost unconstrained by the
trappings of democratic government.
The military's role behind Mr Serrano's action could be a warning signal to
future governments not to try to meddle in its affairs, for example in the
field of human rights.
Even in democratic Brazil the military has been growing restive, pressing
for more funds and criticising the record of the civilian government.
Another important common thread is the difficult relationship between the
president and congress in many countries. The problems in making these
relationships work grow when the judiciary lacks independence or is
perceived as weak or corrupt.
Corruption clearly remains a pretext for military intervention in Latin
America. In some countries, the military is responsible for a good part of
it and plays a role in drugs trafficking.
In Brazil and Venezuela, however, the corruption cases reflect in part a
genuine change towards a more open and accountable society. While the
motivations of those pursuing charges against the heads of state were mixed,
there is at least a hint that politicians in some countries have lost their
immunity from prosecution. The political tensions emerging in both countries
over the last two years are partly due to a clash between genuine democratic
tendencies and old-style oligarchic politics.
In many Latin American countries, the outcome of this clash is yet to be
resolved. The moves in Guatemala do not provide much cause for optimism, but
if Latin America no longer looks like the democratic continent it did two
years ago, then that was because two years ago appearances deceived.
The fact is, elections do not make for democracy, but are part of a process
which needs to be supplemented by a host of other factors, such as judicial
independence and a respect for the rule of law.

FT  28 MAY 93 / US cuts in aid threaten IDA funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENTIRE SDR13bn (Pounds 12bn) replenishment of the International
Development Association, the arm of the World Bank which provides low
interest loans to the poorest developing countries, could be thrown into
doubt by the US Congress's efforts to accommodate new help for Russia inside
a shrinking aid budget.
The US had pledged a total contribution of Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.4bn)
spread over three years, but this year will only allot Dollars 1bn, 20 per
cent less than promised.
Because IDA's money is provided under a burden-sharing agreement negotiated
last year, any other country could now decide to reduce its promised
commitment by 20 per cent, a tempting option at a time of budget crisis in
many developed countries.
The IDA decision and other elements of the US aid bill are expected to
triple the US arrears to international development organisations to around
Dollars 1bn.
The US aid bill produced by Congressman David Obey, who chairs the House of
Representatives subcommittee in charge of foreign aid spending, provides a
total of Dollars 12.9bn, Dollars 1.4bn less than President Bill Clinton had
asked for, and will now move to the Senate for further discussion.
To fit new aid for Russia inside this envelope, Mr Obey has proposed a 2 per
cent cut in every aid spending category except refugees and the Peace Corps,
and much deeper cuts in some categories.
But the administration insisted on no cuts in aid to Egypt and Israel, which
together account for 40 per cent of the US aid budget even though Israel's
per capita income ranks between Ireland and New Zealand, so African and
other developing countries will be particularly squeezed within each
category.
But some aid organisers acknowledged that the blow could have been worse,
noting that Mr Obey had done his best to preserve funding for refugees,
disaster assistance and sustainable development.
Funding for debt relief will be slashed. The US, which has been the only
leading creditor not to grant full relief on loans to the poorest countries
of sub-Saharan Africa, had originally allotted Dollars 45m to debt relief
this year, but this will be scaled back to only Dollars 7m.
President Bill Clinton promised Dollars 1.6bn to President Boris Yeltsin at
their summit meeting in Vancouver in April, added another slice in the
formal budget he proposed a week later, and then promised a further Dollars
1.8bn at a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations in Tokyo earlier this month.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Clinton defends record in office: A few 'glitches' conceded
 -Trade status for China - VAT 'feasible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday mounted a robust defence of his record in
office and the performance of his much-criticised White House staff.
His appearance on a two-hour breakfast television 'town meeting' came just
hours before a budget bill pact with conservative Democrats was voted on by
the House of Representatives.
Mr Clinton confirmed that he would extend China's most favoured nation
trading status for a year 'because I want to support modernisation in China
and it is a great opportunity for America there'. But he said he expected
'some progress' from China on human rights abuses and the use of prison
labour. Other disputes with China, over arms sales and trade, would be
negotiated separately and directly with the Chinese, he said. 'I think they
will appreciate the gesture I'm making.'
On the issue of introducing a value added tax, the president said he thought
it was 'feasible if it is not regressive'. It was something 'we may look at
later on', but was 'such a big issue' that it had to come after economic and
health care reform.
Most of the questions put to the president by his audience of 200 members of
the public in the Rose Garden were about national economic and social
issues, while the programme's hosts concentrated on the controversies over
the White House travel office and Mr Clinton's recent haircut on board Air
Force One which delayed traffic at Los Angeles airport.
On the latter issues, Mr Clinton conceded only 'a few glitches' in their
public presentation. He said reforming the travel office would save money
and was 'good for the country and good for the taxpayer'. He flatly denied
charges of nepotism and cronyism over proposed alternative travel
arrangements.
He insisted his staff had only followed past practice in calling in the FBI
to investigate the travel office without directly consulting the attorney
general's office. But he praised Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, who
has objected to being circumvented, for her 'great judgment', adding: 'She
can question whatever she wants to'.
He also defended his White House staff who, he said, were not as young as
popularly supposed. He would neither confirm nor deny that he was
considering bringing in political heavyweights well versed in government to
bolster the operation.
'If you try and change a lot of things you might break some eggs and it is
not an exact process,' Mr Clinton said. He suggested the Washington
establishment was also partly responsible for difficulties in getting the
administration's message across. 'I think we've done a lousy job of cutting
through the fog that always surrounds this town.'
He listed a variety of achievements and said his own analysis of his first
100 days showed he had spent a quarter of his time on foreign policy, 55 per
cent on the economy and health care and 20 per cent on other domestic
policies.
The president said he spent just 2 1/2 hours on the issue of gays in the
military. But he added he favoured the latest compromise proposal, known as
'don't ask, don't tell,' which would permit homosexuals to serve in the
military but require them to keep their sexual practices private.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Puerto Rican government has suspended a programme of low-interest loans
for its neighbours, threatening the viability of investment projects in the
Caribbean Basin totalling about Dollars 700m (Pounds 454.5m).
Projects likely to be affected include Dollars 165m for new banana farms in
Costa Rica, Dollars 100m to expand electricity services in Guyana, and
Dollars 250m to develop and exploit natural gas fields in Trinidad and
Tobago.
Announcement of the suspension by Mr Baltazar Corrada del Rio, secretary of
state, followed a decision by the US House of Representatives' ways and
means committee to approve changes suggested by President Bill Clinton to
Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Section 936 allows federal tax exemption to Puerto Rican subsidiaries of US
companies. Profits from these subsidiaries are deposited in Puerto Rican
banks. Totalling about Dollars 15bn, these funds have become central to the
island's financial stability.
The administration of the US possession had committed Dollars 100m a year of
the deposits for low-interest loans to business projects in Caribbean Basin
countries. Since 1985 Puerto Rico's neighbours have received loans from
Section 936 funds totalling Dollars 650m.
Mr Clinton has proposed changing the tax break to a wage credit, in an
effort to raise Dollars 7bn for the Treasury over five years.

thought responsible for the murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo,
who, investigators say, was killed after being mistaken for drugs boss
Joaquin 'Chapo' Guzman Lorea, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City.
Cardinal Posadas was being driven in a Grand Marquis car of the kind often

FT  28 MAY 93 / Mulroney successor race opens up: Campbell's lead in Canada
PM stakes is narrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the patrons at Kelsey's, a non-descript bar near Toronto airport,
were glued to the television, cheering their beloved Maple Leafs ice hockey
team on to the Stanley Cup finals.
In another corner, a more subdued - and smaller - gathering was struggling
to hear Mr Jim Edwards explain why he wants to be prime minister of Canada.
Mr Edwards, a member of parliament and government whip from Edmonton,
Alberta, is one of five candidates campaigning to succeed Mr Brian Mulroney
as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. The winner will
automatically also take over as prime minister. A more democratic process
for picking a party leader would be hard to devise.
About 3,800 delegates will cast their ballots on June 13 at a national
leadership convention in Ottawa. Most of the delegates have themselves been
elected by local constituency associations.
For the past two months, the five candidates have criss-crossed the country
trying to extract pledges of loyalty from as many delegates as possible.
Mr Edwards started the day in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he appeared on a
televised debate with his rivals. By lunchtime he was in Toronto, addressing
members of the dowdy Empire Club at a downtown hotel. The morning after his
cocktail-hour visit to Kelsey's, he was due to meet local high school
students, some of whom will be youth delegates to the convention.
Mr Edwards appears to be running third in the leadership race. His prospects
of winning are virtually zero, but a good showing on June 13 could put him
in line for a senior cabinet post.
The odds on him making a creditable showing have improved in recent weeks.
When the leadership race started, all signs pointed to a first-ballot
landslide for Ms Kim Campbell, the 46-year old defence minister.
Thanks to her gender, age, and nimble mind (not to mention a much
talked-about photograph showing her posing bare-shouldered behind her legal
robes), 'Campbellmania' seemed likely to sweep the defence minister not only
through the convention, but also the general election due to take place
later this year.
Several of Mr Mulroney's senior ministers with leadership ambitions of their
own decided to stand aside, sensing that they had little chance of beating
Ms Campbell.
But the aura of glamour and invincibility around her has slipped noticeably.
According to one opinion poll conducted last week, the odds on the Tories
winning the general election are now longer with Ms Campbell at the helm,
than under her closest rival for the leadership, Mr Jean Charest, the
environment minister. Mr Charest is only 34 years old, but his easy-going
style and tireless grassroots campaigning have won him many admirers.
Ms Campbell has yet to overcome the impression in some Tory circles that she
is an outsider who has not yet 'paid her dues'. She entered parliament only
five years ago. Before that, she was a member of British Columbia's Social
Credit party, which is far removed from the centre of power in Ottawa.
Ms Campbell presents herself as a new generation of politician unafraid of
telling things as they are. For instance, she has readily admitted smoking
marijuana in her youth (and inhaling). But some of her remarks have
suggested a too-clever-by-half combativeness more suited to a university
debating society than a national political campaign.
As one political analyst said on a radio chat show the other evening,
'people don't like smart-asses.' The contrast between twice-divorced Ms
Campbell and the contented, family-man image projected by Mr Charest has
also not been lost on the defence minister's rivals.
Despite the recent setbacks, Ms Campbell remains favoured to win the party
leadership, though by a narrower margin than seemed likely a few weeks ago.
Her real test will be the general election, which must be held by November.
The Tories and opposition Liberals are now running neck-and-neck in the
opinion polls. In their appetite to regain power after nine years on the
opposition benches, the Liberals have acquired a greater cohesion than has
been visible for some time, having overcome internal dissension.
Their campaign effort received a boost last month with the appointment of Mr
John Rae, a vice-president at Power Corporation in Montreal with respected
organisation skills, as campaign leader.
They are confident that with a clear lead in Ontario and the Tory vote split
with regional parties in Quebec and the western provinces, they have an
excellent chance of returning to power.
The Tories on the other hand, will be banking on their youthful prime
minister and a fresh set of faces in the cabinet. A flurry of tough
anti-crime bills recently tabled in parliament provides one clue to the
Tories' campaign platform. They will also be helped by an accelerating
economic recovery with the lowest interest and inflation rates in 20 years.

THE Clinton administration yesterday imposed a ban on bids by EC companies
for Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) worth of US government contracts. There has
been a long transatlantic dispute over the Community's utilities procurement
rules. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's top trade negotiator, said the move was
'neither justified, wise or necessary'. The EC could not ignore the 'wholly
unjustified action.'
The US move was was nevertheless expected.
In April the US and EC resolved part of the dispute over procurement of
heavy electric power equipment by allowing each other's companies to bid on
government contracts without receiving special preferences. But because the
two sides could not agree on telecommunications rules, Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, was forced to act to satisfy both Congress and US
law. Mr Kantor originally threatened about Dollars 45m in sanctions just as
a first step. The ultimate Dollars 20m action could be seen as no more than
symbolic.
The US and EC agreed to a process which they expect to lead to an accord in
negotiations on the procurement code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.

CANADA'S House of Commons yesterday evening approved the North American Free
Trade Agreement amid cautious optimism in Ottawa that the pact will also be
ratified later this year, as scheduled, by the US and Mexico.
Nafta is due to come into force on January 1. But doubts about its
implementation have grown in recent weeks as negotiations on two
'side-agreements' covering environmental and labour standards have been
stalled.
A spokesman for Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said yesterday
that Ottawa still views the side-agreements as 'do-able'. He noted that the
three governments 'lived through several moments as difficult as this'
during the main Nafta negotiations.
He said that Canada objects to 'a very narrow and specific feature' of the
US proposals, namely, the use of trade remedies to enforce environmental and
labour standards. Passage of the Nafta enabling legislation through the
House of Commons has been marked by stormy debates, including an all-night
sitting earlier this week. The ruling Progressive Conservative party
eventually used its sizeable majority to close the debate and force the bill
through the House.
The government had been anxious to complete the debate before parliament
adjourns for the summer recess, and before campaigning for a general
election to be held later this year gets into full swing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community are making slow headway in attempts to
generalise their bilateral deal on aircraft subsidies to other members of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The aim is to revise Gatt's
existing code of fair practice on trade in civil aircraft by the end of this
year, in parallel with the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations.
However, it has proved more difficult than expected to extend the bilateral
agreement - which covers only large airliners, and was designed to limit
state supports for the European Airbus - to small aircraft, components, and
a variety of national aids for aircraft development and production.
The revised code is being discussed in conjunction with the proposed Gatt
code on subsidies included in the December 1991 package of draft Uruguay
Round accords.
The US-EC Airbus deal, signed last summer after eight years of transatlantic
feuding, prohibits subsidies for aircraft production and caps development
support at 33 per cent of spending. It also places curbs on indirect
supports, such as those derived by US manufacturers from government defence
and aerospace contracts.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC members agree on farm price deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC-US agreement on oilseeds is set to be ratified by all Community
member states including France on June 8, following an accord reached
yesterday on this year's EC farm price regime.
The bilateral understanding is a vital building block for an overall deal on
the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations.
At 5am yesterday, after four days of talks, EC agriculture ministers agreed
on a predominantly French-compiled list of extra concessions to farmers.
This means EC foreign ministers should be able to wave through the oilseeds
deal when they meet in Luxembourg in 11 days time.
France had strongly opposed the deal with the US, limiting subsidised
oilseeds output to 5.128m hectares, from the moment it was reached last
November in Washington, along with a bilateral agreement on the farm chapter
of the Uruguay Round.
The European Commission is anxious to get the oilseeds dispute out of the
way quickly, fearing that otherwise the US would have a pretext for
reopening the whole farm trade deal reached last year, which Brussels
believes is advantageous to the Community.
This week's concessions increase compensation to EC farmers for 'set-aside',
the land they have to take out of production in order to reduce output. The
production cuts, along with heavy price cuts, are the means through which
the EC is reforming its Common Agricultural Policy and intends to meet the
subsidy cut commitments it has made in the Uruguay Round.
Commission officials say the extra compensation will cost nearly Ecu1bn
(Pounds 770m) over three years, and claim the swelling EC farm budget will
still come in under its ceiling, or 'guideline'.
'Now we know how much French principles cost,' one EC official commented
acidly, adding that a modest multiple of this week's concessions would
probably in the end reconcile France to a full Uruguay Round deal.
Within the terms of the EC-US agreement, direct payments to farmers in
compensation for CAP price and output cuts will be exempt from subsidy cuts
required under the Uruguay Round.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Mexico 'spending Dollars 30m' to boost
Nafta in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MEXICO is to spend as much as Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.4m) on lobbying efforts
by the end of this year, to try to ensure the passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, according to the Centre for Public Integrity in
Washington.
'Mexico has employed a veritable phalanx of Washington law firms, lobbyists,
public relations companies and consultants,' said Mr Charles Lewis,
executive director of the Centre, which draws about 10 per cent of its
support from labour unions.
Basing its conclusions on an eight-month analysis of Justice Department
records, researchers found that 33 former US officials had been hired by
Mexico to try to ensure the implementing legislation for Nafta gets
congressional approval. Among those working for Mexico are former US trade
representative Bill Brock and former analyst for the International Trade
Commission Ruth Kurtz.
The report is the latest snag in the Clinton administration's efforts to
sell Nafta to Congress.
Negotiations among the three governments on labour and environmental
supplemental agreements are now stalled over a US proposal to allow trade
sanctions against companies which demonstrate a pattern of failure to
enforce environmental laws. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, said this week he still expected to complete negotiations
this summer.
The most serious threat to Nafta may come from Mr Ross Perot, the former
presidential candidate, whose 'infomercial' against the accord is due to run
nationwide on television on Sunday night. Mr Perot's folksy presentations
have done much to arouse fear that Nafta will draw jobs from the US to
Mexico.
While many Democrats are in open rebellion against Nafta, Republican
senators and some business groups are threatening to oppose it if the
president succeeds in negotiating strong side agreements.
Union leaders, meanwhile, have given no sign that they will be satisfied by
the proposed tripartite commission on labour standards, which the side pact
would establish.

FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland faces toughest brief - Profile
of the free trade champion likely to be Gatt's new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON and MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Sutherland, former European Community competition commissioner and
now chairman of Allied Irish Banks, is confidently expected to be chosen
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at a special
meeting of the contracting parties on June 9.
Once the EC, US and other European nations made clear their support for Mr
Sutherland, the two Latin American candidates, Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro of
Uruguay and Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia, had no chance of
securing the necessary consensus of Gatt's 111 members.
Mr Sutherland is to take over from Mr Arthur Dunkel, a Swiss who has held
the post since 1980. He will be only the fourth head of the Gatt. The first
two were Sir Eric Wyndham White (1948-65), a British citizen who presided
over the birth and establishment of the institution, and Mr Olivier Long
(1968-80), another Swiss, who was in charge of the Tokyo Round of
multilateral trade negotiations.
Mr Sutherland's pressing task will be to inject dynamism into the world
trade body. His immediate priority will be completion of the Uruguay Round
of trade talks, already 2 1/2 years delayed. The next deadline is the end of
this year, when the extension of the US 'fast track' negotiating authority
now sought by the Clinton administration is to run out.
A strong supporter of liberal trade and Gatt, Mr Sutherland has agreed to
take on this exasperating job after initial hesitation. He does so at a time
of fierce bilateral disputes between the US, EC and Japan and open
questioning of Gatt norms, rules and procedures by the new US administration
and Congress. The credibility of the multilateral trading system is at
stake.
Mr Sutherland established his international reputation as EC competition
commissioner between 1984 and 1988, when he emerged as a key architect of
the single market programme - along with Britain's Lord Cockfield and
Commission president Jacques Delors.
His legal experience made him master of many a complex EC brief and his
negotiation skills - a touch primitive at first - ripened impressively over
time. He quickly saw the potential of the EC's founding charter, the Treaty
of Rome, to break down national barriers, typically using the threat of
action in the European Court of Justice to extract political concessions
from reluctant member states.
Mr Sutherland's efforts to expose unfair state aid and breathe competition
into European industry enjoyed the benefit of a strong tailwind of business
and public support - something the EC lacks today. In particular, the
campaign to break up Europe's airline cartel and usher in cheaper fares was
a popular crusading issue almost made in heaven. That said, the airline
industry is a powerful and well organised lobby and only someone with Mr
Sutherland's persistence could have achieved what he did on liberalisation.
Writing in his autobiography The Enterprise Years, the former British trade
and industry secretary Lord Young says he had a 'high regard for (Mr
Sutherland's) ability and character. . . I thought (he was) quite
outstanding in his grasp both of concept and detail in all the City and
competition matters we had dealt with together.'
A Commission official at the time believes 'his strength derived from the
fact that he was remarkably apolitical. He didn't have the normal fears of a
politician, and marched into a room quite happily to present his case. He
won respect because he always took a straightforward approach.'
Mr Sutherland's high profile stemmed in part from his controversial
portfolio, but also from his widely publicised tussles with the more
dirigiste Mr Delors. Mr Sutherland's stock in Brussels went up sharply when
the stories first started to leak out - but the man patronisingly dubbed the
'little sheriff' by the Commission president was always ambivalent about the
publicity. His support for the Commission's collegiate decision-making style
was genuine and, despite their differences, he and Mr Delors had a mutual
respect.
Although Mr Sutherland played expansively on the European - and even
international - stage when in Brussels, he could not have been accused of
neglecting Irish interests. He broadly supported the thrust of the
Community's common agricultural policy reforms, but on more than one
occasion sought, behind the scenes, to soften the blow for Irish farmers.
Mr Sutherland earlier demonstrated his interest in the Uruguay Round by
participating, notwithstanding the agricultural interests of his country, in
the Eminent Persons Group on World Trade, under the chairmanship of Count
Otto Lambsdorff. Participants included former US trade representative
William Brock and Lord Young. The group called for completion of a
liberalising Uruguay Round in 1990, arguing that 'what is at stake is not
prosperity alone. It is the framework of international competition and
security.'
As a citizen of an EC member state with strong agricultural interests, it
will be particularly important for Mr Sutherland to demonstrate total
disinterestedness in his new role. The director-general represents the
interests of the world as a whole, particularly those of the small
trade-dependent nations that make up the bulk of the Gatt's membership. To
succeed in his task, Mr Sutherland will need to show independence from the
EC.
Senior policy-makers in the leading trading powers are at least showing
renewed interest in making the Uruguay Round succeed. It will be Mr
Sutherland's immediate task to seize on that opportunity and bring the round
to completion at last. This will prove a tougher challenge than any he has
experienced before.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S coalition government yesterday approved a proposal to ease tight
restrictions on genetic engineering research.
The proposed amendment to the three-year-old law regulating gene technology
research, will remove lengthy and costly procedures which had forced the
pharmaceutical industry to conduct most of its research outside Germany.
'At the moment, every single genetic experiment requires a series of
de-tailed documents in order to receive permission. This is greatly
handicapping the competitiveness of German research laboratories,' said Mr
Gehrad Stopa, spokesman for Bayer, the chemical group.
The amendment introduces simpler registration procedures for research
classified as safe for the natural and human environment.
Over 75 per cent of genetic engineering research falls into this category
and could benefit from the amendment.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, said yesterday the proposal was
crucial to ensure that German pharmaceutical laboratories were competitive
with those of other countries, especially the US.
The amendment will go to parliament later this year.

SIR Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner for external economic affairs,
yesterday threw in his lot with the supporters of deeper European
integration and issued a stirring call for a single European currency.
In a speech likely to enrage British opponents of the Maastricht treaty,
including many in his own Conservative party, Sir Leon dismissed the idea
that the EC should develop into a loose, free-trade area extending into
eastern Europe.
'Widening must not mean less deepening,' he told an audience of the Konrad
Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, which included Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Sir
Leon's speech offered a comprehensive view of the future development of the
EC, and reflects a growing confidence inside the European Commission that
Maastricht ratification is within reach.
Turning to the post-Maastricht agenda, Sir Leon called for streamlining and
modernising EC institutions such as the Commission and the European
Parliament, as well as tighter policing of the EC's external frontiers to
control illegal immigration, organised crime and drug trafficking.
But the striking aspect of the speech was its enthusiasm for European
monetary union and the 'undeniable' benefits of a single European currency
to cover exchange rate risks and the commitment to stable prices and fiscal
prudence.
Hilary Barnes adds from Copenhagen: The European Community and Russia hope
to agree the substance of a treaty on co-operation and trade in time for the
EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. Mr Brittan will visit Moscow for more
talks next week.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Waigel unveils steep budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday unveiled plans to cut
state spending across the board to cope with the consequences of 'the
sharpest economic crisis' since the foundation of the German federal
republic in 1949.
He promised a law to reduce welfare benefit levels, an indefinite extension
of the ban on new programmes which have no compensatory cuts to finance
them, and a medium term ceiling of 2.75 per cent annual growth in state
spending - half the forecast nominal growth rate of 5.5 per cent.
The severe cuts in social spending programmes, including unemployment and
retraining subsidies, met furious criticism from the opposition Social
Democrats in the German parliament yesterday, which was voting on the last
round of more modest budget cuts.
The new package is supposed to find extra savings of at least DM20bn (Pounds
7.9bn) in 1994, in order to keep the central government budget deficit down
to DM70bn. But the real squeeze is on longer term spending, to prevent the
current recession-induced deficit becoming a structural one.
Mr Waigel warned that Germany must change its attitude, and could no longer
plan on the basis of steadily increasing economic welfare.
'Whether real gross national product falls by 1.5 per cent, 2.0 per cent or
even more, is not the decisive question,' he said. 'The decisive thing is
rather that all plans and expectations for constantly increasing prosperity
must be revised.
'In the space of just two years, in 1993 and 1994, we must support both
socially and financially almost 1m additional unemployed workers,' he said.
'And we must continue to support the revival of the east (Germany) on the
basis of a significantly weaker western economy.'
Mr Helmut Wieczoreck, the SPD budget spokesman, described the proposed cuts
in welfare benefits, such as a 3 per cent cut in unemployment benefits, as
'an act of social piracy'.
Mr Rudolf Dressler, deputy leader of the SPD in parliament and its social
affairs spokesman, accused the government of seeking to dismantle the
welfare state, and impose all its spending cuts at the expense of the
weakest in society.
Mr Waigel has given himself little more than a month to negotiate his DM20bn
budget cuts for 1994, before the draft budget has to be approved by the
cabinet in early July. It will then go before parliament in September. At
present there looks to be little prospect of an agreement with the
opposition on the necessary cuts in social spending, which means that the
budget could be blocked in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament,
where the SPD has a majority.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who resigned this week as president of Germany's
powerful I G Metall trade union amid allegations of insider trading, is
being investigated on suspicion of tax evasion, the Frankfurt prosecutor's
office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Italy counts the cost: Bomb damage at the Uffizi art gallery
in Florence after yesterday's attack is likely to top L30bn

FIREMEN, policemen and visiting dignitaries yesterday replaced tourists at
the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, looking at bomb damage, not art.
The full scale of the destruction caused by a huge car bomb only began to
come to light at mid-day after museum staff had made a preliminary
assessment of the gallery and its priceless treasures, and salvage teams had
cleared the debris from a radius of 300 metres surrounding the Uffizi in the
heart of Florence.
'The damage was far worse than I suspected,' said Mr Stefano Martelli, a
junior curator. 'I live some 8km out of Florence and heard the blast but
never imagined it was like this, or could be a bomb.'
The sturdy 16th century structure of the gallery withstood the blast but all
30 sets of windows on either side of the museums's famous courtyard were
blown in. In the street adjoining the explosion, buildings had crumbled and
ancient guttering hung sadly from top floors. It was in this street, close
to the River Arno, that the main casualties occurred, including the killing
of five people.
'Most of us came as soon as we could and we have been working since before
eight this morning to remove pictures from the damaged galleries,' said Mr
Martelli. He reckons as many as 1,000 pictures will have to be moved.
Police cordoned off the area around the gallery for fear of looters and the
gallery itself was closed to all save staff and security experts.
There is structural damage to the wing closest to the blast and the normal
visitors' entrance has had part of its ceiling affected. 'The pictures have
been damaged by glass fragmentation in the blast, and this has lacerated
some paintings. Others have been peppered with a fine combination of dust,
fragments of glass and masonry,' said another member of the gallery staff.
Visiting the nearby church of Santo Stefano de la Porta, temporarily housing
important 14th century works, it was possible to see glass damage. Blown in
windows have gashed the paint down to the white undersurface of a Madonna,
and a Giotto Madonna has been lightly peppered with minute particles.
'Luckily the most important paintings in the damaged wing had protective
glass in front of them and this has saved them,' said another official.
Many of those helping to clear up the damage yesterday had helped in 1976
when the Arno overflowed and flooded part of the Uffizi, causing serious
damage. It is reckoned that at least L30bn (Pounds 13.2m) will be needed
immediately to cover repairs. 'We have plenty of restorers - that is not the
problem. It is the time taken to clean and re-hang the paintings, plus
insuring that all the security systems are fully repaired,' said Mr
Martelli.
A full list of the damaged works should be available in the next few days
but already the museum has accepted it has lost three paintings in the
Caravaggesque gallery, with another 30 badly damaged. The damage was caused
in galleries 25-45. Those containing the treasures of the Florentine
Renaissance were completely unaffected.

THE GOVERNING Hungarian Democratic Forum is stretched to breaking point
after the resignation of the party leader who has held the conservative and
nationalist factions together.
Mr Lajos Fur, who gave up his unifying role as party president late on
Wednesday, said in a statement published yesterday that his efforts to
resolve an 'intolerable war between brothers' had ended in 'bitter failure'.
Mr Fur's departure leaves the Forum without a bridge between the moderate
conservatives of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, and a smaller group
around Mr Istvan Csurka, the populist writer who broke Hungary's political
calm with a virulently anti-communist and anti-semitic tract last year.
One party leader said the only solution was a 'peaceful divorce'. The
long-awaited formal split could come next week at the Forum's national
delegate meeting. A breakaway by Hungarian Justice, the party-within-a-party
set up by Mr Csurka and claiming the support of 29 far-right MPs, would cost
Mr Antall's government its parliamentary majority.
The Forum's internal strife coincides with growing restlessness among the
governing party's coalition partners and promises a rough parliamentary ride
for the government's emergency budget plans.

MS Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister, yesterday warned that the
country's economic reforms would be delayed if her government is toppled in
a vote of no confidence this morning.
She was speaking in parliament on a Solidarity-proposed no-confidence motion
which, if passed, could lead to new elections. Ms Suchocka said: 'It is a
paradox that this debate comes as our economic recovery is becoming ever
more apparent.' Industrial output rose 7.6 per cent in the first four months
of this year.
Solidarity, which normally supports the coalition, called the no-confidence
vote in protest at the government's refusal to award pay rises to striking
health workers and teachers. Mr Aloyzy Pietrzyk, a Solidarity official,
said: 'This coalition government has for the past 11 months implemented
policies which represent capitalism with an inhuman face.'
The coalition may scrape by with a thin majority after the small PL farmer's
group decided yesterday to abstain.

The Forum's internal strife coincides with growing restlessness among the

Government officials are braced for a parliamentary rebellion against a plan
to increase value added tax, cut public sector pay and lower the public
sector deficit from 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 5.6
per cent in 1994.
The government's task looked more daunting this week when the finance
ministry admitted economic recovery would not start in 1993 and there could
be a fourth year of recession. The ministry said GDP would stagnate or fall
by up to 3 per cent in 1993, abandoning predictions of 0.3 per cent growth.
Consumer prices were forecast to be 20-22 per cent higher this year than
last.

CONTROVERSIAL plans to open up access to European Community energy networks
and increase competition between suppliers could be watered down after
intense opposition from most EC governments.
Mr Abel Matutes, the energy commissioner, favours amending existing
much-criticised draft legislation so that member states will no longer be
obliged to grant access to the electricity and gas networks.
Mr Matutes' predecessor, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, had proposed that large
consumers - for example, steel, chemicals and fertiliser companies - should
be granted access to energy networks this year. If successful, the right to
buy electricity and gas anywhere in Europe would have been extended to
smaller consumers from 1996.
Instead, it is now suggested that users who want to buy energy across EC
borders would negotiate access to other networks, signing individual
contracts. Member states and operators would have to justify any decision to
refuse a request - for example, on the grounds that there was insufficient
capacity, the negotiated price was too low, or there was a risk that
domestic energy companies would be unable to meet their obligations to
existing clients.
Launching the original measures last January, Mr Cardoso e Cunha said a
single market in energy could save consumers 'tens of millions of Ecus'.
Only Britain, which has liberalised its own energy network, was wholly in
favour of the proposals. Other member states expressed cautious approval for
related measures, aimed at introducing more transparency into energy
companies' accounts and ending monopolies over electricity production. But
Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Luxembourg and - on gas - the Netherlands, are
still strongly opposed to 'third party access'. 'The directives as they
stand now are completely unacceptable so we are working on the assumption
that they will be amended or watered down substantially,' said one
Commission official.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Deadlocked Russian cabinet fiddles while the rouble burns:
The currency approach 1,000 to the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE ornate hall of a Stalinist-era skyscraper, the young men with the
cellular telephones yesterday saw the relentless slide of the rouble as a
reflection of everything that is wrong with the Russian economy.
As the Russian currency teetered on the brink of the psychological threshold
of Rbs1,000 to the dollar - only to be stopped at Rbs994 by the central bank
selling what is thought to have been Dollars 30m dollars for roubles, so
President Boris Yeltsin was telling the cabinet that stabilising the
exchange rate should be one of its key priorities.
Apart from making the politicians jumpy, the currency's slide is seen as a
national humiliation by ordinary Russians brought up on decades of the
artificially-fixed exchange rate where one rouble was worth more than the US
dollar.
'This psychological aspect does not affect dealers and banks as it does
public opinion, those who read the newspapers,' said an official on Moscow's
Inter-bank Currency Exchange (Micex), where the rouble is traded twice a
week. 'Those who are part of the market have a kind of objective view of
what's happening. The round numbers do not make any difference.'
Since the launch of market reforms a year and a half ago, the rouble's
decline against the dollar from Rbs200 has been an unpleasant mirror of high
inflation, lax credit policies, and a lack of faith in politicians' promises
to make things better. Few observers doubt it will go through the Rbs1,000
barrier when trading resumes on Monday, as part of a new pattern of daily
trading.
'It would be very strange if the rouble stabilised since credit emission is
continuing despite all this talk of stabilisation,' said Mr Andrei Koshelev
one of the dealers representing the Russian banks which trade on the
exchange.
'Everybody is looking for a miracle to live better,' said Mr Alexei Osenmuk,
the exchange's deputy director. 'But the rouble reflects the real situation
in the economy.'
In his office on the other side of the Moscow River, Mr Kakha Bendukidze,
one of Russia's wealthiest men, smiles with satisfaction. As the head of a
large private group of companies, he makes most of his money exporting
Russia's rich natural resources for dollars, and is delighted that the
central bank is no longer intervening aggressively to support the currency
as it did last year because this means the currency's fall is uninterrupted
and therefore more predictable.
The slide has, however, caused him to stop importing consumer goods for sale
in Russia. For state importers of commodities such as sugar and grain, which
continue to enjoy subsidised exchange rates, the shock has been less brutal.
But the subsidies indirectly fuel inflation because the central bank simply
prints the money.
For industrial companies which do not enjoy a subsidised exchange rate,
spare parts and inputs are becoming unaffordable or are driving up prices
even further.
Officially, the government and the central bank have agreed that the latter
will no longer sell precious dollars to support the rouble until inflation
is brought under control. Apart from stabilising the country's finances by
cutting the budget deficit, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, wants
to widen and deepen the currency market through so-called technical
measures.
These include plans to allow foreign businessmen to open rouble bank
accounts and sell hard currency, a move which has been resisted by the
central bank as enabling foreigners to buy up Russian assets on the cheap.
But many Russian officials agree with western lawyers and bankers in saying
that opening the market will not help unless the Russian authorities define
clearly what foreigners are allowed to do with roubles.
'It is practically impossible for somebody to invest in something without
firm guarantees, and the right to private property,' says Mr Osenmuk.
There is little doubt that the most important obstacle to the rouble's
stabilisation is the authorities' lack of credibility, stemming from their
failure to implement a united, and comprehensive economic reform package.
Not only do the central bank and finance ministry not trust each other, but
the cabinet itself is divided between radical reformers and conservatives.
President Yeltsin has yet to use his victory in the referendum last month to
break the deadlock.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Suchocka fights for survival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MS Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister, yesterday warned that the
country's economic reforms would be delayed if her government is toppled in
a vote of no confidence this morning.
She was speaking in parliament on a Solidarity proposed no confidence motion
which, if passed, could lead to new elections. Ms Suchocka said: 'It is a
paradox that this debate comes as our economic recovery is becoming ever
more apparent.' Industrial output rose 7.6 per cent in the first four months
of this year.
Solidarity, which normally supports the coalition, called the no-confidence
vote in protest at the government's refusal to award pay rises to striking
health workers and teachers. Mr Aloyzy Pietrzyk, a Solidarity official,
said: 'This coalition government has for the past 11 months implemented
policies which represent capitalism with an inhuman face.'
Today's vote could see the six-party coalition scrape by with a thin
majority after the small PL farmer's group, which recently left the
government in protest at its agricultural policies, decided yesterday to
abstain. Parliament's voting rules mean that abstentions in the 460-seat
chamber amount to a vote in favour of the government.
No party appears to have enough seats or allies in parliament to form a
stronger coalition than Ms Suchocka's. Yesterday President Lech Walesa
described Ms Suchocka as 'the best prime minister we have had until now'.
This implied that were the government to fall he would ask her to try to
form a new cabinet. He also hinted that he would not dissolve parliament if
the no-confidence motion succeeded.
A recent opinion survey showed 41 per cent wanted a cabinet reshuffle while
retaining Ms Suchocka as the head of government. Another 31 per cent wanted
new elections while 5 per cent wanted the present government unchanged. Just
6 per cent want to see a government headed by President Walesa.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Constitutional court to rule on abortion law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE difficulties of integrating two different social systems in Germany will
be tested today when the constitutional court decides whether a new abortion
law is binding.
The law, passed by the Bundestag in June 1992, but immediately referred to
the constitutional court by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is a reminder that women
in the former east Germany had far more rights than their western
counterparts before unification.
Abortion in the eastern states was available free on demand, without medical
consent, up to the 12th week of pregnancy. In west Germany, abortion was
tightly restricted, requiring recommendation by at least three doctors. This
was anchored to the constitution, which states that 'everyone shall have the
right to life and to inviolability of his person.' In the event, many women
either travelled to Holland, or used personal connections in west Germany.
Unification meant a compromise had to be found. After months of debate, a
free vote was held in the Bundestag. The eastern deputies of the ruling
Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the liberal Free
Democrats voted to liberalise abortion throughout Germany, but with some
restrictions. A woman had the right to an abortion for up to 12 weeks,
provided she accepted counselling.
The outcome was challenged by Chancellor Kohl, concerned about losing
support from the conservative wing of the CDU and particularly its sister
party, the (Catholic) Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria. He
immediately applied for an injunction to the constitutional court.
As a result, united Berlin is still divided. Women in the west are bound by
pre-1989 restrictions, while women in the east have retained their
pre-unification status.
The court now can throw out the law, ask for amendments, or accept it.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Five killed in car bomb attack on historic Florence art
gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN authorities yesterday blamed the Mafia for the huge car bomb
explosion which killed five people, injured more than 50 and damaged a wing
of the Uffizi gallery in Florence.
Prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi vowed to defeat what he described as a
terrorist offensive, widely seen as a reaction to the recent arrests of some
leading Mafia figures and to moves to clean up Italian politics.
'It is without doubt a Mafia terrorist attack,' interior minister Mr Nicola
Mancino said after an emergency meeting of Italian security chiefs.
Italy's main union groups said they would hold a two-hour general strike
today to protest at the blast, which came less than two weeks after a
similar bombing in Rome.
The Florence explosion damaged more than 30 paintings, three irreparably,
and caused damage within a radius of 300 metres of the gallery.
Florentine police found traces of explosive and the shattered remains of a
Fiat Regata in a street adjoining the Uffizi Gallery.
Standing in front of what is Italy's most famous art gallery, Mr Alberto
Ronchey, the culture minister, said: 'This is a vile act and for the first
time people have sought to attack right at the heart of our cultural
heritage.
'The Uffizi in the historic centre of Florence is regarded world-wide as a
symbol of western culture.'
He said the gallery would be closed indefinitely, but added: 'We will seek
to open at least part as soon as possible because it is vital that we show
we are undeterred and can carry on as normal, especially at the height of
the tourist season.'
According to Ms Annamaria Petrioli Tofani, director of the Uffizi, the
paintings damaged beyond repair were in the Caravagesque Gallery, in the
part of the Uffizi nearest the river Arno. A painting by Giotto, the Madonna
alla Costa, dating from 1300, was among the other damaged works. Many
paintings were saved by their anti-vandal plexiglass shields.
Haig Simonian adds from Milan: Mr Luciano Violante, chairman of the
parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, attributed the incident to either the
Mafia or the Camorra, its Neapolitan equivalent.
They were the only powerful criminal organisations able to mount such an
attack and to gain some advantage from the diversion of police resources it
would create, he argued.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Lamont angry at dismissal as Major reshapes cabinet: Clarke
is promoted to chancellor - PM seeks to revive government's authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT left the Treasury last night angry and embittered after Mr
John Major sought to restore the battered authority of his government by
replacing him as chancellor with Mr Kenneth Clarke.
Ending a power struggle which had threatened to paralyse his government, the
prime minister balanced the elevation of the centrist, pro-European Mr
Clarke with the appointment of the rightist, Euro-sceptic Mr Michael Howard
as home secretary. Mr John Redwood was the only new appointment to the
cabinet, taking the post of Welsh secretary.
But a reshuffle which otherwise resembled a game of political musical chairs
was soured by the acrimony surrounding Mr Lamont's departure.
After refusing to accept a demotion to the post of environment secretary, Mr
Lamont gave public vent to his anger by issuing a terse statement in which
he failed conspicuously to pledge his continuing support for Mr Major.
The statement, sent by facsimile to 10 Downing Street, was a deliberately
abrupt reply to a letter from the prime minister in which Mr Major praised
Mr Lamont for the tough decisions he had taken during his 2 1/2 years at the
Treasury.
In an atmosphere reminiscent of the stormy cabinet departures that preceded
Mrs Margaret Thatcher's downfall in 1990, there was speculation at
Westminster that Mr Lamont might now become a champion for Mr Major's
political enemies on the Conservative backbenches.
Mr Lamont is an instinctive Euro-sceptic whose support for the Maastricht
treaty has been grounded in pragmatism rather than enthusiasm. In his
statement, Mr Lamont said he did not intend to make any further comment 'for
several weeks'. He believed that 'the success of the policies I have put in
place will become increasingly clear with the passage of time'. His
departure after a tense 30-minute meeting with Mr Major yesterday morning
followed a bitter behind-the-scenes power struggle in the highest ranks of
the government.
In spite of the other ministerial changes, the former chancellor and the
manager in 1990 of Mr Major's leadership campaign was left in no doubt that
the principal objective was his removal from the Treasury.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said the prime minister was like 'the
captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as they head for
the rocks'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Lamont's
move was 'a sacking dressed up as a reshuffle'.
A Mori poll in today's Times showed Labour leading the Tories by 16 points.
The poll showed Labour at 44 per cent, the Tories at 28 per cent and the
Liberal Democrats at 24 per cent - one of their highest ratings.
Mr Lamont's efforts to remain in office were overcome by the determination
of Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief
whip, that he should be replaced.
Some of Mr Lamont's friends suggested last night he might seek to damage the
prime minister by giving his account of the events which led to sterling's
departure last autumn from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Lamont,
whose reputation never recovered from the ERM debacle, refused to accept
blame for an economic strategy set in place by Mr Major.
But senior ministers said that Mr Major's decisive action in sacking Mr
Lamont had restored his personal political authority. To have kept him at
the Treasury would have been an admission of political weakness which would
have continued to drain the prime minister's personal authority and left him
vulnerable to a challenge in the autumn.
Mr Clarke, who alongside Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is the most
confident and powerful politician in the cabinet, is seen by a majority in
the Conservative party as offering Mr Major his strongest chance of
restoring the government's reputation for economic competence.
Although committed to the principle of managed exchange rates, Mr Clarke has
made clear that he will not risk antagonising the Tory Euro-sceptics by
seeking to take sterling back into the ERM in the short to medium term. He
is also expected to underline his commitment to reducing the level of public
borrowing by keeping to the government's public-spending targets and
continuing with the Treasury's review of the welfare state.
The appointment of Mr Howard as home secretary gives him charge of the most
central element in next year's legislative programme - a crackdown on crime
to restore the government's tarnished reputation as a guardian of law and
order.
Mr Major shuffled the portfolios of six cabinet ministers and made 18 other
alterations to those below cabinet rank. Among those moving were Mr John
Gummer, a close ally of the prime minister. He went from agriculture to the
higher-profile Environment Department. Mr David Hunt moved from the Welsh
Office to the Employment Department, replacing Mrs Gillian Shephard, who
became agriculture secretary.

FT  28 MAY 93 / How the news travelled from Grimsby to London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS fitting that Norman Lamont's mum should steal the prime minister's
thunder on the day her son was sacrificed to appease the government's
critics.
By noon yesterday, reshuffle speculation had reached fever-pitch, sterling
was buoyant and the odds on the Conservatives winning the next general
election were about to be shortened
Behind the scenes on this day of high drama, Downing Street was engaged in
the sort of news management operation that it once handled with its eyes
shut.
Then, at 12:06, the news flashed across news agency screens: Mrs Irene
Lamont, 82, had told the Grimsby Evening Telegraph that her son had called
to say he had resigned as chancellor. Mrs Lamont told the Telegraph: 'For
the past three years they have given Norman a rough ride.'
It was always going to be messy, but when the news from Grimsby broke, any
notion that the bloodletting was going to be smoothly managed, let alone
painless, quickly evaporated.
The day had started with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, telling Mr Major
to stop dithering. As if by prearrangement, Downing Street instantly
obliged, serving notice that 'limited' changes at 'all levels' of government
were to be made.
No names were given, but it later emerged that Mr Major had decided about a
week ago that yesterday would be the day.
Trenchcoated reporters abandoned the Commons where a debate on the UK
poultry industry was among the main attractions and charged through the
Whitsun drizzle to Number 10.
Behind the famous black door, Mr Lamont had already heard the bad news. He
was not seen entering Number 10, only leaving Number 11. Only history will
confirm if he used the connecting doors between these famous addresses to
get the sack.
A flow of ministerial Rovers, summoned to the headmaster's study by a series
of early morning telephone calls, then began.
The sprightliest hacks were in time to see Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home
secretary, ushered into Mr Major's presence. Game over, reporters concluded.
Cuddly Ken had been anointed as a chancellor with the common touch.
Just before 10am, Mr Michael Howard, leading rightwing contender for Mr
Lamont's job, arrived. The waters were muddied further when Mr Lamont
entered Number 11 saying he had 'never felt better'.
Significantly, however, Mr Clarke had never looked better when he emerged at
10.10am and waved obligingly to camera.
A succession of lesser lights - Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr David Hunt and Mr
John Redwood - shuttled in and out to the accompaniment of the brass band in
nearby Horseguards Parade.
As the afternoon wore on, Mr Lamont was spotted glumly leaving the Treasury.
Downing Street said Mr Lamont had departed without the customary courtesy of
a letter to the prime minister. His parting shot was a terse statement faxed
across later. Mr Lamont was then reported shopping at Harrods.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Wise men warn on budget deficit and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial and Economic Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY and the City were bursting with advice yesterday for the new
chancellor to cut spending and keep a lid on inflation.
The reaction to Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment came as sterling fell
against the D-Mark amid fears that interest rates would be cut.
Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasts at London Business School
and one of the 'seven wise men' advising the Treasury, said Mr Clarke had
got to 'carry further the policy of getting the budget deficit down' and act
decisively on the threat of inflation.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said the new chancellor
should 'substantially cut' public spending to pull back the rising
government deficit, expected to be about Pounds 50bn this financial year.
He said greater openness in policymaking was required, in particular to find
out what went wrong last autumn when Britain was forced to leave the
European exchange rate mechanism.
By contrast, Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction
company, called for a more expansionary policy. 'Mr Clarke must now deliver
the economic strategy for sound and sustainable growth which we were
promised by the prime minister,' he said.
Fears that Mr Clarke would cut interest rates and further stimulate the
economy contributed to sterling's weakness on the foreign exchange markets.
Shortly after Mr Clarke's appointment was announced on news agencies, the
pound fell 2 3/4 pfennigs against the D-Mark, reaching a low of DM2.4950
before closing in London at DM2.5075. In late New York trading the pound was
at DM2.5046. Against the dollar it rose nearly a cent in London to close at
Dollars 1.555. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.56185. Gilts and shares
ended little changed on the day. Some industrialists lined up with the City
economists in urging the chancellor to be tough on spending. Mr Peter
Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The priority
of the chancellor has to be to keep inflation under control.'
Mr Martin Taylor, chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said
public finances needed to be brought under control to avoid a sterling
crisis. 'If this (Mr Clarke's appointment) is the way of securing party
unity behind difficult and painful measures, then it had to be done.'
On environment, Mr Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said
the key test was whether the incoming Mr John Gummer could win battles with
the other ministries, particularly transport and the Department of Trade and
Industry. Ms Janet Langson, director of the Water Services Association,
representing the water companies, called for 'clear decisions' over
relations with Ofwat, the industry watchdog.

INLAND STEEL Industries hopes to achieve profitability sometime in the
second half of the year, Mr Robert Darnell, president and chief executive
officer, said yesterday.
The company expected a period of sustained profitability after 1993, he told
shareholders at the annual meeting in Chicago, in which the good years would
match the record results of 1988, when net earnings neared Dollars 120m.
He added that the trough years in the business cycle would still see the
company in the black.
With first-quarter net losses cut from Dollars 694m to Dollars 31.4m, Mr
Darnell said the underpinnings were in place for a return to profitability.

FT  27 MAY 93 / French left-overs on the block: A privatisation plan
designed to deal with unfinished 1980s business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Balladur government yesterday unveiled its privatisation plan, designed
to roll back the frontiers of state involvement in the French economy and,
just as important, to help finance recovery and the struggle against rising
unemployment.
The list of 21 companies to be sold off is impressive. Twelve - notably the
two big banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris; the three
insurance companies, UAP, GAN and Assurances Generales de France; and
Rhone-Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine, and Pechiney, in chemicals, oil and metals,
respectively - were scheduled for privatisation in 1986 when the
conservatives were last in government, and Mr Edouard Balladur was finance
minister. Rescheduling them for sale deals with business left unfinished
when the stock market crashed in 1987 and the Socialists won victory in
1988.
But the 1993 list puts nine new companies on the auction block. Three are
what earlier French governments regarded as sacred national institutions -
the motor company Renault; Air France, the state's flagship carrier; and
Aerospatiale, part maker of the Airbus and France's nuclear missiles.
The eventual passage of all these companies into private hands would
radically reduce the size of what is still, after Italy, Europe's biggest
public sector. The privatisation process would also probably be irreversible
by any future socialist government - not only on grounds of cost. At
yesterday's cabinet meeting, which approved the draft privatisation bill,
President Francois Mitterrand voiced the same 'public interest' reservations
he had in 1986 when he temporarily blocked the privatisation decree.
This time, the government faces no political problems in getting
privatisation through parliament. But Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, has no delusions about the scale of the financial challenge ahead.
Whereas the last French privatisation drive began in the buoyant environment
of the mid-1980s, the new phase is being launched at a far less favourable
time, when the French economy is in recession, the Paris stock market is
volatile and some of the candidates for sale are under intense financial
pressure. The critical question for Mr Alphandery is whether current market
conditions will impede his privatisation plans.
However unfavourable the timing, the new French government has little option
but to proceed. Indeed, as became alarmingly clear this week, getting a
large amount of cash from a successful sell-off of state assets is the only
way it can both restrain public borrowing and finance economic recovery. In
announcing the sale of FFr40bn worth of 'Balladur bonds' - which will pump a
total of FFr26bn in new money into unemployment programmes, public works and
housing - the government said it still planned to keep the 1993 budget
deficit at FFr317bn. This means, as Mr Alphandery spelled out yesterday,
that it needs to get the entire FFr40bn equivalent of the special bond issue
back this year in privatisation proceeds.
The critical question is whether the stock market will be able to absorb the
stream of newly privatised French companies. At first glance the omens are
bad. The last centre-right government sold off FFr120bn of public sector
companies in 29 flotations between spring 1986, when it came to power, and
the market crash in October of the following year. The success of those
share sales was fuelled both by the dynamism of the Paris stock market and
by a keen appetite among international investors for the then-novel French
privatisation stocks.
Times have changed. The Paris market is in a fragile state. The CAC 40 Index
of 40 leading companies was virtually static in 1992 and has mustered only a
slight increase from 1,858 at the end of last year to 1,890 yesterday. The
French economy which, until recently, was more resilient than its European
counterparts, is now technically in recession. The government estimates that
gross domestic product will fall by 0.1 per cent this year.
Despite this gloomy scenario, international investors have remained
relatively positive about French equities. Warburg Securities estimates that
although the Paris bourse accounts for 23 per cent of the value of
Continental European stock markets, it represents about 26 per cent of a
typical Continental portfolio. However, international investors have
recently been adding little to their French portfolios because the strong
franc makes French shares more expensive.
International investors might also be deterred by the French government's
efforts to 'protect' the newly privatised companies. Mr Alphandery has
revived the noyaux durs concept favoured by the last centre-right government
of encouraging long-term investors to take strategic stakes in in former
state companies. He has, however, said such shareholder groups will be open
to foreign companies, thereby scrapping the 20 per cent ceiling that limited
foreign stakes in the previous privatisation round.
He has also extended the 'golden share' system, whereby the government can
block bids in strategically important groups. Whereas the 1986 'golden
share' lasted for five years, its 1993 version will have an indefinite
lifespan. This is the government's price for extending privatisation into
the defence sector, with Aerospatiale and Thomson, the electronics group, up
for eventual sale.
'There is still an appetite for privatisation stocks, as the success of the
recent Spanish issues has shown,' said Mr Joe Hall, head of European
equities at Warburg. 'But investors are much more discerning about what they
will buy now than they were in the mid-1980s. The French government will
have to be careful to present the right companies at the right price, unless
it is willing to risk selling recovery stocks at a discount.'
A number of privatisation candidates fall into the 'recovery' category. The
Credit Lyonnais banking group lurched into the red in 1992 and earlier this
month warned of difficulties in France this year. UAP and GAN, the insurers,
suffered sharp falls in profits last year. The Bull computer group made a
loss in 1992, as did Air France.
The consensus among observers is that the first candidates for sale will be
more robust industrial concerns such as Elf, Rhone-Poulenc and Pechiney. The
likeliest financial contenders are AGF, the most resilient of the insurers,
and BNP, which is seen as a safer bet in banking than Credit Lyonnais.
Both the industrial and the financial groups are keen to see an end to the
financial engineering which has sometimes accompanied state ownership: for
instance, BNP reluctantly had to take a stake in Air France, and Pechiney
had to acquire a stock market quotation for its international operations in
order to make foreign acquisitions.
The Paris bourse is also hoping for an end to its traditional liquidity
problem. Mr Alphandery has already proposed to abolish investment tax on
small investments, and yesterday's bill encourages employees to buy shares
in their newly privatised companies. His overall goal is to persuade French
investors to switch some of the FFr1,200bn now invested in money market
funds into equities.
It is very doubtful whether this second wave of privatisations will have the
same impact on the Paris marketplace as the first wave. The number of
individual owners of shares rose from 1.7m in 1986 to 6m two years later.
Such an increase would be hard to repeat.
But, regardless of what happens on the stock market, yesterday's bill
probably marks a turning point in French industrial policy, particularly for
those companies, such as Bull or Air France, which may be distant
privatisation prospects. In the short and medium term, 'the way will be open
for them to seek industrial partners which in many cases are a condition of
their survival', Mr Alphandery said.
Privatisation is also likely to have a knock-on effect on the 'monopolies'
such as France Telecom, Electricite de France and Gaz de France. As
monopolies at least at the retail level, these utilities are to stay within
the state sector, but the industry ministry plans to introduce competition
in some of their activities. Although this privatisation is not as
far-reaching as those in the UK under Margaret Thatcher, one day France's
utilities might end up in the private sector. Mr Alphandery has said that
any company 'in the competitive sector' can be put up for sale.

SHARP, the Japanese consumer electronics and office equipment manufacturer,
yesterday blamed a 37 per cent drop in parent pre-tax profits to Y44.5bn
(Dollars 405m) for the year to March on the downturn in the Japanese economy
and the appreciation of the yen.
Sales fell 4 per cent to Y1,153bn as Japanese corporate spending and
consumption was depressed and overseas markets remained weak, the company
said.
Group pre-tax profits, meanwhile, plunged by 30 per cent to Y51.6bn and
parent net profits fell 31 per cent to Y25bn.
Audio and communication equipment in particular recorded a big fall in
demand, with sales falling 16 per cent. Television and video equipment sales
slid 10 per cent.
Sharp was also hit by weakened demand for home electrical appliances such as
air-conditioners, which were affected by the cool summer in Japan last year.
The division suffered a 6 per cent fall in sales.
The strength of the yen affected Sharp, which sells about 50 per cent of its
products overseas.
On a more positive note, the group benefited from its strength in liquid
crystal displays with strong demand for its LCD panels. The company is
seeking to cut costs by restructuring its operations to reduce dependence on
consumer electronics.
It expects these moves to help it raise non-consolidated sales in the
current year by 2 per cent to Y1,180bn and net profits by 4 per cent to
Y26bn.
Sharp will increase its capital spending this year by 12 per cent to Y90bn
and its R&amp;D expenditure by 6 per cent to Y110bn.
KDD, Japan's international telecommunications operator, reported a 1.8 per
cent fall in sales to Y240bn in the year to March and a 12 per cent plunge
on operating profits to Y17.1bn, both hurt by the downturn in the country's
economy.
However, the group was able to raise pre-tax profits by 2 per cent to
Y26.7bn and net profits by 11 per cent to Y15.7bn.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is negotiating to sell its
German-based telecommunications cable business to NKF Holding, a Dutch unit
of Nokia of Finland.
The move follows the failure earlier this year of talks between Philips and
Siemens, the German electronics company, on combining their cable activities
into a joint venture.
Philips declined to reveal its asking price. Its cable manufacturing plants
in Cologne and Nuremberg employ 1,100 people and generate annual sales of
DM350m (Dollars 214.7m). Philips said its plant in Cologne would phase out
the production of copper cable before being transferred to NKF.
The acquisition will mean a big increase in size for NKF, which has annual
turnover of Fl 443m (Dollars 246m).
NKF is a former Philips subsidiary which left the group through a management
buy-out in 1986. Nokia later built up a stake of nearly 60 per cent in the
company.
Fokker, the Dutch aerospace group, is exploring a possible partnership in
space technology with Matra Marconi of France, AP-DJ reports.

FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Davy probe near completion -
Result of investigation into share placing expected early June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IRISH Stock Exchange says that its investigation into the April 30
placing of 25.4m shares in Greencore, the sugar, milling and malting group,
by Davy, the Dublin stockbroking firm, is expected to be completed early
next month.
The investigation is focusing on several aspects of the placing, including
Davy's original share placing arrangements with SG Warburg, the London
broking firm with whom Davy has said there was a profit and loss sharing
agreement which was abandoned on the day of the placement.
Warburg was to have taken up to 10m of the shares, as a buyer of last
resort, but Davy ended up placing 7m shares with groups associated with the
Davy directors instead.
Two investigators from the London Stock Exchange's surveillance unit
together with Mr David Mulville, the ISE's compliance officer, are
apparently heading the investigation.
In a new development earlier this week, Davy said that some of the telephone
conversations made from the company's dealing room, failed to be recorded on
the day of the Greencore placing. As standard practice, most brokers record
dealing room telephone calls to clear up any subsequent misunderstandings.
In the week following the placement, trading in Greencore shares were
suspended in London and Dublin for two days, after the Irish government,
which owned the Greencore shares, said it had been informed by Davy that
there might be legal problems with the placement.
The ISE then took the unusual step of making a public statement saying
Greencore shares had been trading on the basis of 'misleading information'
following the placing and that the conduct of Davy was to be investigated.
Several overseas institutions then pulled out of the placement. However, it
was rescued by Davy's parent, the Bank of Ireland, which stepped in to buy
9.6m of the shares at the offer price of IPounds 2.75.
Mr Leonard Abrahamson, the ISE's new president, said the main findings of
the investigation will be made public.

Profits at Rolfe &amp; Nolan Computer Services, a futures and options computer

for the year to end-February.
Last month the group acquired the 80.1 per cent balance of Brokerage Systems
and under current accounting rules had to take that company's losses into
its year-end figures.
Excluding those losses Rolfe's pre-tax profit would have totalled Pounds
1.71m.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 6.74m to Pounds 11.23m with Brokerage
Systems contributing Pounds 3.27m. Earnings per share emerged at 17.7p

FT  27 MAY 93 / France plans to privatise 21 state-run companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE's new centre-right government announced wide-ranging plans yesterday
for an ambitious privatisation programme.
Its plans involve the sale of 21 public-sector companies including the
Renault motor group, Air France and the banks Credit Lyonnais and Banque
Nationale de Paris.
The proposals, intended to complete and extend the sale of state assets
begun by the last conservative administration from 1986 to 1988, immediately
ran into controversy when Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president,
warned the weekly cabinet meeting that some companies should remain under
state ownership to 'protect the national interest'.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister and architect of the privatisation
plan, described the proposed share sales as central to the new government's
efforts to create a 'modern and sound economy'.
The new proposals abandon the 20 per cent ceiling on foreign investment in
privatised companies.
Mr Alphandery has also introduced initiatives to encourage individual share
ownership and to persuade employees to invest in their own companies.
Mr Alphandery did not specify how much he planned to raise from the sales,
due to start in September.
The last centre-right government's privatisation drive involved selling 29
companies worth FFr120bn (Pounds 14.2bn).
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has already announced that the state
hopes to generate at least FFr40bn by the end of this year.
The names of those companies to be privatised first will be announced
immediately after the privatisation legislation has been passed through
parliament.
Mr Alphandery said the timing of individual sales would be determined by
market conditions. There is no time limit for the new programme, which could
be extended after the 1995 presidential elections.
Analysts have voiced concern that the French government may find it more
difficult to sell off its assets in the present recessionary climate
compared with the buoyant economy of the mid 1980s.
One snag is the strength of the franc, which might deter international
investors.
Another is the sluggish state of the Paris stock market, which has been
virtually static since the start of this year and yesterday was stable, with
the CAC-40 index on 1,890.
The privatisation candidates include 13 companies scheduled for sale by the
last centre-right government. Among them are three insurers - Union des
Assurances de Paris, Assurances Generales de France and Groupe GAN - and the
Thomson electronics group, Bull computer company, Elf-Aquitaine oil group
and Rhone-Poulenc chemicals concern.
Among others are Air France, Renault, the Usinor-Sacilor steel group and
Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern, all previously considered too
'sensitive' to be in the private sector.
However, stakes of more than 5 per cent in health, defence or security
stocks will be subject to government approval.
Mr Alphandery has also revived the concept of the 'golden share', whereby
the state can vet shareholders and block takeover bids in certain privatised
companies. The 'golden share' has now been extended from five years to an
indefinite lifespan.

Correction (Published 3rd June 1993) appended to this article.
THERE IS a new breed of finance director, whose CV reads something like
this: graduation from Oxbridge, a couple of years in management consultancy,
an MBA course at a good business school. They move through a series of jobs
in blue chip companies to reach finance director of a sizeable quoted
company by their early 40s, with a good chance of becoming chief executive
of another within five years.
They all have one other thing in common: they are not accountants. There is
a perceptible trend towards non-chartered accountant finance directors in
the boardrooms of UK listed companies. Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director
of Prudential and chairman of the Hundred Group of finance directors, says a
quarter - and growing - of the group's members are business school graduates
or management accountants, with the odd banker, treasurer or tax expert
thrown in.
This trend seems to reflect both the increasing complexity of business and
the broadening scope of the finance director's role. Institutional
shareholdings have grown in recent years, the financial sector has become
more complicated and fast moving, and the balance of emphasis in the finance
director's job has shifted accordingly.
Reporting and control are as important as ever, but risk and transaction
management, strategy and external relations have become just as crucial. The
role has become more active, and an understanding of the markets, commercial
flair and a gift for strategy have become prerequisites. Chartered
accountants no longer hold the monopoly on such qualities. Indeed, some
would argue they are at the opposite end of the commercial spectrum.
Mr Simon Duffy, finance director of Thorn EMI and not a chartered
accountant, says: 'The natural instinct of accountants is to say 'no', and
they should instead be supporting good business decisions and finding ways
of saying 'yes'.'
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, argues that
accountants make good finance directors in that they have 'a disciplined,
rigorous, hard fact-based approach to business'. But they make bad ones in
the sense that 'that's not the whole story, and it tends to divide things
into accounting periods'.
The continued encroachment of non-chartered accountant finance directors
depends on three factors: whether the chartered accountancy institutes make
their training more business-oriented; how far other training grounds -
business schools, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Institute
of Taxation, for example - take the initiative; and how the role of the
finance director itself develops.
The first is unlikely: since 97 per cent of accountants do not become
finance directors of public companies, there is little incentive for the
institutes to change. Judging by experience in the US, the business schools
and the treasurers will continue to weaken the stranglehold chartered
accountants have traditionally had on the job. In the US, only a fraction of
chief financial officers are certified public accountants - the nearest
equivalent qualification.
As for the third, Mr Donald Macleod, a partner in the executive search
company Korn/Ferry, echoes the views of many when he predicts that over the
next five to 10 years the finance director will increasingly be the
second-in-command to the chief executive.
Mr Andrew Harrison, finance director of Courtaulds Textiles till earlier
this month, says: 'There is no doubt that it is preferable for public
company finance directors to be qualified accountants, because they spend so
much time talking about accounting and finance. But the more senior you are
and the bigger the company is, the content of the job changes. It becomes
more commercial, more broad, more strategic, and more people-oriented. So it
is possible for the right individual to do a good job without being an
accountant.'
Harrison is himself not an accountant, which he sees as positive. 'I can
explain accounting issues to the City in non-jargon, layman's language,' he
says. 'It does no harm talking about any problem from first principles and
accounting doesn't always coincide with common sense.'
But Harrison and the other non-qualified finance directors stress that a
highly qualified team is an essential back-up. Most would not consider
promoting a non-accountant as finance director of a subsidiary because of
the lack of technical support in the divisions and because strategic skills
are less of a requirement at that level.
It is not just that the finance director's role has widened. Accounting and
treasury have become so much more complex that a good company accountant or
treasurer needs to be a specialist technician. As a result, many companies
have split the job below finance director in two, with a director of tax and
treasury and a director of financial control.
Simon Duffy, who arrived at Thorn EMl via Harvard business school,
Rothschilds merchant bank, Shell International, Bain, Consolidated Gold
Fields and Guinness, says: 'Unquestionably I am not as well positioned to
make judgments on technical and accounting issues. I have to rely more on my
staff for that. On the other hand I don't get bogged down in accounting
detail, nor have any vested interests in accounting principles, so l am able
to stand back and see what l want.'
Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director at Kingfisher, points to Geoff
Mulcahy, his chief executive, as the archetype of the new breed of finance
director. Mulcahy was a Harvard MBA who became finance director of Woolworth
Holdings (Kingfisher's previous name). James Kerr Muir, the new finance
director, is also a Harvard MBA and was previously managing director of Tate
&amp; Lyle UK.
'A commercial upbringing is essential to the finance role we have here,'
says Whittaker. 'We have plenty of very good accountants in the finance
functions throughout the group so we need a broader base for the finance
director. Having said that, when we recruited James we had an open mind
about whether we wanted an accountant or not, but he was the right man for
the job.'
Kathleen O'Donovan, the audit partner from Price Waterhouse recruited by BTR
last year, and Richard North, hired by Burton from Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
1991, came straight from the profession. But most companies recruit finance
directors from within industry. Operational experience is seen as vital.
Indeed some finance directors hold a line job in addition to their
functional role.
Many new accountant finance directors today may have had as much operational
experience as the MBAs. And it is true that companies are more open-minded
about the background of a new finance director. But selection revolves
around the nature, experience, and qualities of the individuals rather than
their training.
It used to be axiomatic that finance directors were qualified - preferably
chartered - accountants. The pre-eminence of the qualification is now under
threat to the extent it may even come to be seen as a disadvantage.
It may have taken the MBAs a little time to break through, as a result of
the prejudices and conditioning of British business. But the old adage that
the accountant finance directors have got where they are today despite,
rather than because of, their training is ringing truer than ever. Only
those accountants who can demonstrate a raft of other skills and qualities
will be able to stand head to head with their non-qualified peers.
CORRECTION
MS KATHLEEN O'Donovan, finance director of BTR, was previously a partner
with Ernst &amp; Young, not Price Waterhouse as stated in last week's
accountancy column.

Zambia yesterday said it had deployed troops along its 850 km border with
Angola to prevent Unita rebels from attacking, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
'Unita has been threatening to attack us for a long time now so we have sent
troops to the north-western provinces,' a Defence Ministry official told
Reuters.
Thousands of Angolan refugees have fled into Zambia since the civil war
resumed between the Angolan government and Unita (National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola) after the rebels rejected their defeat in
September's elections.
